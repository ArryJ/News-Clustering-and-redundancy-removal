Last week, social media was abuzz with a video that captured an over enthusiastic fan forcibly kissing actress Ashika Rangnath while she walked the red carpet at an event. The man was seen planting a kiss on the actor’s cheek and running away as bouncers chased after him. While onlookers are shocked, the actress is seen taking a while to recover. However, as it turns out, not all is what it seems to be. Ashika clarifies, “This shot was a scene that we were filming for Raymo. It takes place right before a fight sequence , when a man displays unwanted affection towards my character. It looks like someone on the set has taped the filming and shared it online. I have been flooded with calls since. Had it been real, you think I’d have kept quiet and been so casual? Anybody who tries to act fresh with me, will not be spared and that’s a given.

We are shooting the film in various parts of India,” he says. Prod him about his role, and he says, “As an artiste, I never believe in roles. It is always about the performance for me. In two decades of my career, I have played various characters and shot 10-12 movies simultaneously. But all my characters and scripts have been very different from each other every time.”Not many know that Rajpal has friends in Kollywood. He counts Suriya one among them. In fact, he travelled to Chennai to attend the actor’s wedding. “Suriya is a good friend. Today, I feel that all the film industries are well connected. We all know each other, and we are all aware of who is doing what. I have always been a fan of Rajini sir, Mohanlal, Mammooty and Nagarjuna. I also admire the kind of work Vadivelu , Brahmanandam and Yogi Babu do, and I hope the day comes soon when we all can share one stage and showcase our talents,” he says.Interestingly, Rajpal has played a role in the Telugu film, Kick 2. He’ll also be seen in a yet-to-be-titled Kannada film, in which he’s dubbed for his character as well. “Though I can’t reveal details of the project yet, I can say it’s been a great learning experience.

It feels like all the hard work that I’d put in all these years is slowly bearing fruit. I’m also happy that I’m getting to do the kind of work I’ve always wanted to do, something that I learnt in acting school... like, Safaibaaz and Love of H2O, which are aimed at creating social change. It’s not that I’m slowly drifting from comedy to more serious topics. It’s just that as an artiste, I feel happy if I’m able to make a small difference in the mindset of society.”The actor credits his directors for shaping his career. “There are so many directors who have played a pivotal role in making me who I am today, but it’s Ram Gopal Varma, David Dhawan and Priyadarshan who built my career — one launched me, the other one made me explore comedy and the third one showed me the depth of comedy. They taught me the essence of creativity,” he says.My connection with Tamil NaduI keep visiting Tamil Nadu for my films. I’ve shot movies like Taarzan: The Wonder Car and Ek Aur Ek Gyarah in Ooty.

Speaking to us, Suneel says, “I had taken a break of nearly one-and-a-half years from acting, as I was concentrating on directing a film. When the offer for this serial came to me, I couldn’t reject it, as I felt the role is quite challenging. In Manasare, my character has two distinct shades. Initially, I will be playing an exuberant 25-year-old guy with a don’t care attitude. But over the years, maturity sets in and he becomes a responsible and caring father who firmly believes in family values. The bond between a father and daughter, which is very rarely touched upon on for the small screen will be one of the main highlights of the serial.”Director Ravikishore lets us in on a little more about the show. He says, “This is a story about a father who hates his elder daughter, but loves the younger one more than his own life. Deprived of her father’s affection, the older one finds solace in the unconditional love from her stepmother.

16,['17/02/2020'],Modern kitchens warm up to traditional cold-pressed oils,"Cold-pressed oils, touted to be healthier than regular cooking oils, are emerging as the latest health fad globally. But are cold-pressed oils new to us? Interestingly, desi ghee and the oils that were produced locally were a vital part of our ancestors’ diet. Nutritionist and dietician Shikha Mahajan says, “Traditionally, all ingredients, used by any society, were locally sourced and available. Oils were no exception and were made from seeds like almonds, sesame or mustard and nuts like peanut and coconut. Incidentally, these are oils that need the least amount of processing and are easy to produce.”Experts suggest that living and consuming food the way our ancestors did is probably the best way to live a healthy life. “Earlier, oils were extracted from mustard, groundnut or sesame seeds. These were unrefined oils extracted through cold pressing and were, therefore, extremely healthy and suited for Indian cooking,” says hospitality consultant Aslam Gafoor.Over the years, various oil substitutes became a part of our diet, thanks to technology, changing food habits and our growing love for cuisines from all over the world. Nutritionist and dietician Nmami Agarwal explains, “The shift has been witnessed because of inclusion of Western cooking methods. Nowadays, it’s not just rotis and paranthas that are prepared in Indian kitchens. Pancakes, tortillas, pizzas, salads and pastas have become a regular part of diet too. Earlier, shallow or deep frying were the most commonly used methods. Now, steaming, stewing, baking and roasting have also become common. Hence, the inclusion of different types of oils.”“There is growing awareness on the low nutrient content and health hazards of refined oils. Hence, virgin coconut oil, walnut oil, flaxseed oil, peanut oil and olive oil, are making a comeback in Indian kitchens,” explains Aslam. And, the future looks positive, stress experts. “History is indeed repeating itself. With a sudden surge in demand for organic or cold-pressed oils, people are opting for traditional cooking oils, especially the cold-pressed ones like mustard, sesame and coconut oils. Cold-pressing is the best method to extract oil as there is no use of heat or solvents to preserve essential fatty acids,” adds Nmami.The process of producing cold-pressed oils leaves minimal carbon footprint, as it is extracted locally, and not imported. These oils contain saturated fats, monounsaturated fats, polyunsaturated fats and trans fats. The reason we should go local is that all the four are balanced automatically based on the topography and offer multiple health benefits. “Traditional cooking oils such as mustard oil, coconut oil and ghee are definitely superior to modern-day refined oils as they are excellent for health. Make sure to include these traditional oils in your daily diet,” says Nmami.Food historian Shri Bala points out, “If you look at the oils used in South India — gingelly, coconut and groundnut — its usage mostly depended on what was available in abundance locally. People need to understand that they should consume food based on the region they belong to. Mustard oil, which is quite common in North India, wouldn’t work in the Southern region, as mustard helps retain heat in the body, whereas in the South, the body needs a coolant. Our consumption should depend on the topography, climate and the gene pool. It is important to consider these aspects before following any health fad.”Sun dry seeds or nuts (as the case may be) properly to reduce the moisture content. This may take several days. The dried seeds or nuts are then put into a pressing machine, made of steel or wood, where they are pressed to slowly release oilfrom them. Although heat is generated in this process, it is only 30 to 40 degrees, which doesn’t destroy the nutrients.The oil that is collected is then cured by keeping it out in the sun.The byproducts of this process can be used as cattle fodder and fertilizers.",life-style,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74160936,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-2291648/74160936.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//life-style/food-news/modern-kitchens-warm-up-to-traditional-cold-pressed-oils/articleshow/74160936.cms
17,['17/02/2020'],"Nitish Kumar calls for nationwide ban on alcohol, says prohibition has not made his state poorer","This story is from February 17, 2020

NEW DELHI: Calling for nationwide prohibition on alcohol on the lines of Bihar, chief minister Nitish Kumar on Sunday claimed that contrary to popular belief, the ban on liquor since 2016 has not made his state poorer. He claimed that not only has the state recovered from the modest initial losses but revenue from other household consumption items has gone up with income earlier spent on liquor now getting diverted to family requirements.

“Those who cite revenue loss as a justification for not going ahead with prohibition, I will say these are nothing but bogus claims,” Kumar said offering to states to study the Bihar experience. He also sought a pan India movement to seek a ban on online pornography and said that he has made his concerns on this known to the Central government too.

He was speaking at a convention of the Liquor Free India campaign steered by voluntary organisation Milita Odisha Nisha Nibaran Abhijan and other regional organisations. Deputy chairman Rajya Sabha Harivansh who is from Janata Dal (United) was also present along with Gandhian Radha Bhatt among others.

The Bihar CM shared that in 2015-16 the revenue from liquor was around Rs 5000 crores. A year after prohibition was implemented in 2016, an assessment of revenue loss on account of liquor was just about Rs 1000 crores. Kumar said that this revenue loss too was made up by over the years since then with the money the state earned from taxes on goods whose consumption increased because of the diversion of family fund which would earlier be used for liquor. “Revenue started going up on things like milk, mithai (sweets), clothes etc,” Kumar said. He said that the benefits of the ban have resulted in better health outcomes, decrease in domestic violence, more income coming into the house and fewer accidents. “The women have played a big role in making the implementation of prohibition a success,” Kumar added.

As of now prohibition on alcohol exists in Gujarat, Bihar, Nagaland, Mizoram and Lakshadweep . To make his point on alcohol, Kumar shared that a team from Rajasthan recently visited Bihar to study the execution of prohibition. Rajasthan is ruled by a Congress government led by chief minister Ashok Gehlot .

The Bihar CM said that the experience since prohibition came into effect in Bihar in April 2016, has made his resolve firmer that till he is there he will ensure the ban remains in place. Bihar is set for assembly elections later this year and clearly Kumar sees prohibition of alcohol as an achievement of his government that he wants to showcase before the country.

He, however, admitted that there were challenges on the way to enforce the law and there were gaps and black sheep within and outside the system too. “To check these problems one has to be alert all the time and therefore the IG prohibition has been asked to review the implementation on a daily basis,” Kumar said. He also shared concerns over people going to neighbouring states for getting alcohol to evade the ban in Bihar.

20,['17/02/2020'],"India’s top athletes must participate in National Games in Goa, says IOA chief Batra","This story is from February 17, 2020

PANAJI: The 36th edition of the National Games seems to be finally happening in Goa, or so they claimed at the launch event last month, riddled with glitches and embarrassing moments. The Indian Olympic Association (IOA) has had quite a few tiffs with state government officials, largely over inordinate delays. But with the Games now scheduled for October 20 to November 4, IOA president Narinder Batra feels it’s time to look ahead. Excerpts from an exclusive interview with TOI.

Are you happy that the National Games are finally happening in Goa?

Now the Games are definitely happening, there is no doubt about it. Otherwise, you wouldn’t see the Games launch and the mascot being released. The way we have now been discussing with chief minister, deputy chief minister, sports minister and other people, the spirit is there to make it happen. I don’t have any doubts.

Doubts have been there because the Games have been delayed for too long…

Don’t go into history. If you want to do something, then forget history, look at the current situation and take it from there. What happened previously, let’s forget about it. I am happy that the Games will happen.

The National Games have always been delayed. How do you look at such delays?

Can you give a specific case, or are you making a general statement?

Kerala 2015 happened four years after the Games were initially scheduled. Jharkhand were scheduled to host in 2007 but happened only in 2011…

That’s in the past. There is no point going into history. We are now ensuring there are no delays. The secretary general (of IOA) has said we want to make sure that the Games are held every two years. The (Union sports) minister also said the same thing. We are already on the job. We will ensure that the Games are now held on time.

How feasible is the idea to have the Games every two years?

I don’t see a problem.

So, after Goa 2020, it will be Meghalaya 2022?

The Games may even happen in 2021. They have 50 years of the state’s formation and want to host the event that year. Work is on in all the three places ( Chhattisgarh , Uttarakhand , Meghalaya). All of them will be ready in time, or even before.

The National Games in Goa are happening in an Olympic year. How will you convince India’s top athletes to take part, since they would have given their all for the Olympics…

The Olympics end on August 9, so there is sufficient time for athletes to come back and compete in October. I see no reason why the top athletes should not participate. There is no reason. There are no other international commitments, there's nothing else happening. Athletes and sports federations are committed to ensure that participation is of the highest level.

Will the IOA ensure that the top athletes do not stay away?

It’s a commitment that everyone has. These are standard protocols, people understand that. The top athletes have to participate, unless they are injured. Then there is nothing we can do.

There were doubts about Goa’s ability to host…

I don’t know how there was an impression that Goa is incapable of hosting. Rather I am feeling that the Asian Beach Games should also be held here. I don’t know how you got that idea. I personally don’t think like that. The people I have been dealing with, I find them energetic and positive.

But the IOA themselves have written letters accusing officers of lying…

I don’t go into history. Situations change, people change. There have been changes in Goa as well.

National Games require a lot of infrastructure. States have to make huge investments. Will it be better for IOA to rotate the Games among states who already have the infrastructure?

Leaving aside one or two states, almost everyone now has the necessary infrastructure. The idea of National Games is to spread the games across the country. Take Goa for example. They had good athletes in the past and maybe, the National Games here will help revive interest. Infrastructure cost will always be there. The government invests in so many things, so why ignore sports? If you are fit, you may not need so much of medical attention. Why ignore fitness?

The IOA has spoken about the central government lending organising states a helping hand. How do you take that forward?

It’s not in my hand. The government of India used to provide Rs 125 to Rs 150 crore (infrastructure) grant to organise the Games. I don’t know if Goa has received anything. But the (central) government stopped (the scheme) three or four years ago. That’s what we discussed with the sports minister. There is a need to revive the grant. I would work on a 50-50 cost sharing on infrastructure. That’s my idea which I would be rooting for. The final decision would be left for the sports ministry, ministry of finance and the state governments. That is all political working and cannot be worked out at my level.

21,['17/02/2020'],Coronavirus outbreak: Government mulls export ban on 12 essential drugs,"(Representative image)

NEW DELHI: Around 12 medicines — mainly antibiotics, vitamins and hormones — may face export restrictions soon as the government explores measures to ensure there is no shortage of essential drugs in India due to the lockdown in China’s Hubei’s province, the epicentre of the coronavirus outbreak and also a major supplier of raw material or active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) used in medicine formulations.The eight-member expert committee constituted by the government to assess availability of medicines in the country has suggested imposing export restrictions on 12 drugs including antibiotics like chloramphenicol , neomycin, metronidazole, azythromicin, clindamycin; vitamin B1, B2 and B6; as well as hormones like progesterone used during pregnancy and in menstrual related problems.Besides, the panel has urged the Centre to ask states to invoke provisions of the Essential Commodities Act and launch a strong vigil against hoarders and any kind of artificial shortage. States must take steps to ensure that traders do not exploit the opportunity and hike prices of either API or medicine formulations, the panel said in its report.“We have finalised the report and will submit it to the government by Tuesday,” an official, who is part of the expert committee, told TOI. TOI has reviewed the draft report.“We have gathered that there is enough inventory to continue for at least the next two months. However, since Hubei and Shandong are the two provinces that supplies 20-25% of the raw material, if the lockdown continues for another 15 days, there may be a cascading effect. We have recommended a temporary export restriction on 12 drugs which are completely dependent on supplies from these two provinces,” the official said.He added that the committee was also in touch with the Indian consulate general in Shanghai and had received information that API producing units in other provinces had resumed production and 45-50% of supplies from China was secure.India imports around 80-85% of APIs from China. While some major pharma companies like Lupin, Sun Pharma and Dr Reddy’s Laboratories manufacture APIs locally for some medicines, it is mostly for captive use.The committee sought data from leading pharmaceutical firms, industry associations like Indian Drug Manufacturers Association (IDMA), Indian Pharmaceutical Alliance (IPA) and Organisation of Pharmaceutical Producers of India (OPPI).It also consulted chemists and druggists associations to get a feedback on stocks in the market.",business,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74166301,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-236374,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/govt-mulls-export-ban-on-12-essential-drugs/articleshow/74166304.cms

Viswanathan Anand has an image of being an introvert, so, when he took to stage at a Gurgaon event recently, the audience was surprised by his wit, outspokenness and occasional self-deprecating humour. In an hour-long interaction, the five-time World Chess Champion touched upon his early years, greatest rivals, and his life outside chess. He also answered the audience’s questions and highlighted the physical toll chess takes upon professional players – something that not many outside the sport are aware of. “Simply put, playing chess has physical consequences. My muscles feel tired. I feel tense. All the physical manifestations of exhaustion come through. Recent studies have shown that your heart rate goes up for a long time and you lose a lot of calories. Some of it is speculative, but at least, we are thinking in that direction. So yes, it is physically very demanding and it has become more so recently. The nature of the game has changed,” he said.Despite his calm demeanour, Anand admitted that he, too, loses his cool, particularly while training or after a defeat. “There have been a couple of times at press conferences where I couldn’t keep my cool and snapped,” he said. Recalling a press conference, which happened after he lost his world title to Magnus Carlsen in Chennai in 2013, Anand said, “After the match I lost in Chennai, there was a Norwegian journalist who kept needling me and at some point, I said, ‘I don’t know if you understand English.’ So, I may not make the top 10 of chess players behaving badly but I have my moments.”Anand emphasised that young players need to earn the respect of the senior pros, too, which is only possible by performing. He recalled being snubbed for an autograph by the then world champion, Anatoly Karpov , at the 23rd Chess Olympiad in 1986, where Anand was making his international debut as a 16-year-old. “I went and asked him for an autograph, and he said ‘No!’ Two years later when I became a Grandmaster , he came up and spoke to me. Maybe the first time, I did not appear on his radar,” Anand said.In 1997, when Deep Blue defeated Garry Kasparov, it became the first computer to beat a world chess champion in a match.

While his outbursts did raise quite a few eyebrows, he was also appreciated for being his true self in the house. BT had a quick chat with the actor, who was declared the winner of 'Bigg Boss 13' on Saturday night. Read on...Yes, that’s how I am and I wouldn’t have wanted it any other way. Generally, you are supposed to think before you speak, but I was natural. If I was nice to someone, it’s because I felt it; if I was apologetic, that, too, came from the heart — this is how I have always been with the people around me. In the house, many people advised me to not react in a particular way, because they said you never know how your anger or the way you behave is perceived outside. But there are situations that crop up and you end up reacting to them. There are people who have the same reactions for every situation and they get into a pattern, but I don’t think I got into any pattern. I have always been good to someone who is good to me and vice versa. You can fake once or twice, but not for four months. If I was faking it or deliberately showing anger or love, then in the last task, I could have saved anyone else. But I saved Paras. I did that because I felt it. I may not have been perfect, but I was real.(Laughs!) I met him. Asim spoke to me and he cleared everything. We shook hands and it’s all good now.I like the sound of that. I would like to believe that there are some good qualities about me, but I am not aware which particular quality attracts women towards me.Good luck to Shehnaaz for her show. I will always support her and may she get more work. Regarding the future, I can’t really comment because I always take things as they come. I am not someone who sits down and thinks about the future because that’s not in your hands. I like Shehnaaz because of the way she is and that’s why I was attached to her. That was not something for the show and it will not disappear just because the show has ended. I have always told her that whenever she needs me, I will just be a call away.I know Shilpa well and I don’t think she is the kind of person who would claim anything like that. Also, I have just come out of the house, so I have no clue. I’ll have to read what she has said.I would not know if I was a favourite contestant in the house. Today, I am the winner because I have received tremendous support from viewers and it feels great.I was not concerned about who my competitors were because I was focused on winning. I wanted to do the best I could to win. I am sure all of them were strong, but I never wanted to compete with them; I was just chasing the goal that I had set out to achieve and things just happened.Over the past four months, I have realised that people may say things about you, which are not true. I am not someone who really comes out and clarifies things when they are misconstrued because I feel it is not required. You won’t see this so-called aggressive side of mine outside the house because we don’t encounter such situations in real life. I also learnt that my perception about people is generally right.Bigg Boss ki awaaz and interacting with Salman sir on a regular basis.",tv,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74161955,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-64255/74161955.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//tv/news/hindi/bigg-boss-winner-sidharth-shukla-i-may-not-have-been-perfect-but-i-was-real/articleshow/74161955.cms

Whatever I am today is because of the audience and they have made me reach so far. I am happy for Sidharth. Mujh mein bhi wohi junoon tha. For someone who has come from nowhere, becoming the first runner-up is a big deal. If you ask me, I haven’t lost. Main jeeta hi hoon. It’s the format of the show that only one person emerges as the winner. As far as calling me names, log kuchh bhi bole, but I am standing here today. Log bolte hain aur maine karke dikhaaya (smiles).The same goes for him, too. Unka bhi nahi dikhta. Woh logon ka nazariya hoga ki main unke saath ladta tha. Main jahaan se dekhta hoon toh mujhe hamesha hi neeche dikhaane mein sab lage the. I felt that I was being targeted every time from my accent to the fact that I wore perfume worth `150. I didn’t know English when I moved to Mumbai. Tab sab bolte the ki chhote sheher se hai toh baat kahaan karega. Jab English seekhi, tab bola accent aa gaya. They don’t see the positive side... when they mock me, it reflects their, personality not mine.I didn’t know anyone inside the house, as I come from the world of modelling. My friendship with Sidharth happened organically. However later, misunderstandings seeped in and I had to take a stand because it was about my self respect. I don’t regret anything, apart from the extra ladaai. Everything is fine between us as of now.You are in the house for so many weeks, toh aapko nahi pata chalta aapne kitna aur kya kiya. In the real world, I can control my aggression.It’s their point of view that my friendships were based on convenience, but mere end se main real tha. Maine apni dosti nibhayi, but beech mein aisi harkatein hui ki mujhe unki dosti fake lagi. I didn’t appreciate it and so, moved on.I never hit on her. Dosti thi aur bahut comfortable zone mein the. I knew she was married. Neither of us hit on the other. It won’t make any sense if I react to it because I haven’t said anything of that sort.I was excited to see her. I would talk to the imaginary her when she wasn’t inside the house for two months. I fell in love with her. Baaki logo ko lagta tha ki main baahar aa kar badal jaunga. I told her that what mattered to me was her opinion and our love for each other. It wasn’t for the cameras. We are in a relationship and want to know each other more in the outside world.There was no engagement. I was in a relationship. I didn’t shy away from admitting to my past, sab ka hota hai. The relationship ended long before I entered the BB house. What I feel for Himanshi is real.I want to do films and rap as well. My attitude is positive and I am certain that my future is bright. I will take up every opportunity that comes my way.

27,['17/02/2020'],Tejas Fighter Jets: HAL to provide IAF with 83 Tejas fighters in Rs 39k cr deal,"NEW DELHI: The biggest deal in the indigenous military aviation sector has been finalised, with the overall cost of IAF acquiring 83 single-engine Tejas fighters and their support package from defence PSU Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) being slashed from the earlier around Rs 56,500 crore to Rs 39,000 crore.The over Rs 17,000 crore reduction in overall cost has come after hard-nosed negotiations spread over a year. The defence ministry and IAF were initially shocked at the “exorbitant price” being demanded by HAL to produce the 83 Tejas Mark-1A jets along with the maintenance and infrastructure package.“With the contract price now settled at Rs 39,000 crore, the procurement file is being sent to the Cabinet Committee on Security for final nod. It should be cleared before this fiscal ends on March 31. Once the contract is inked, HAL promises to begin deliveries of the Mark-1A jets in three years,” said a source.It was in November 2016 that the Defence Acquisitions Council had first approved the procurement of 83 Tejas jets at a cost of Rs 49,797 crore. But HAL had responded with a quote of around Rs 56,500 crore, which led to protracted cost negotiations. “HAL, for instance, was even charging profit on imported components. Item by item, the cost was brought down. IAF also cut down some of its support requirements,” said the source.Down to just 30 fighter squadrons (each has 18 jets) when at least 42 are required for the requisite deterrence against Pakistan and China, the IAF is banking upon the long-delayed light combat aircraft Tejas to make up the free fall in numbers.The first four Rafale fighters will touch down at Ambala airbase in May, with the remaining 32 following in batches by April 2022 under the Rs 59,000 crore deal inked with France in September 2016. But the slow production rate of the home-grown Tejas fighters by HAL, much like its protracted development saga, remains a major concern for IAF.The IAF’s ‘Flying Daggers’ squadron at Sulur has till now inducted only 16 of the original 40 Tejas Mark-1 fighters, which were all slated for delivery by December 2016 under two contracts worth Rs 8,802 crore inked earlier.The 83 Tejas Mark-1A fighters are slated to have 43 “improvements” over the Mark-1 jets to improve maintainability, AESA (active electronically scanned array) radar to replace existing mechanically-steered radar, air-to-air refuelling, long-range BVR (beyond visual range) missiles and advanced electronic warfare to jam enemy radars and missiles.“The flight testing for Tejas Mark-1A will hopefully be completed by 2022. After these 123 fighters, the IAF is also looking to induct 170 Tejas Mark-2 or the MWF (medium weight fighter) jets with more powerful engines and advanced avionics,” another source said.But the Tejas Mark-2 and the indigenous stealth fifth-generation fighter aircraft called the advanced medium combat aircraft (AMCA) will take several years to fructify. For now, IAF is keeping its fingers crossed the Tejas Mark-1A does not get delayed any further.Read this article in Bengali",india,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74166382,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-93575,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/hal-to-provide-iaf-with-83-tejas-fighters-in-rs-39k-cr-deal/articleshow/74166367.cms

29,['17/02/2020'],Jamia violence: Videos of police action inside Jamia library trigger fresh row,"04:17Shocking footage emerges of cops thrashing Jamia students in Dec 2019

NEW DELHI: Two months after violence at Delhi’s Jamia university during an anti-CAA protest, a video clip showing police barging into a varsity library and beating up people there with sticks went viral early Sunday morning, leading to an outrage and sharp political reactio ns.The leak of the CCTV footage early Sunday morning was followed hours later by two other clips coming into public domain, one of which showed youths entering the same reading room — some with what appear to be stones in their hands — and trying the block the entrance of the hall. This clip appears to be of events preceding police’s entry into the reading room.Students from Jamia’s anti-CAA protest group, Joint Coordination Committee (JCC), said the footage confirmed their allegations of police brutality on campus. The university administration said the clips were not leaked from their end.One of the videos that came into circulation later showed youths hurrying into the reading room while another showed youths gathered at the balcony of the first-floor library and then quickly dispersing. These clips were seen by some in social media as “proof” that “rioters” were trying to hide in Jamia buildings.Cops have taken copies of all three videos and have launched an enquiry into the incident.One of the videos, a 44-second clip, shows youths who were seen on the corridor, entering the library and blocking the entrance door with a bench.Special Commissioner (Crime) Praveer Ranjan said, “We have taken cognisance of the latest video of December 15 of Jamia Millia Islamia library which has surfaced now. We will investigate it.”Cops have particularly taken cognisance of two of the three videos which show a group of men barging into the Zakir Hussain library. One of the youths, with long hair is seen carrying what appears to be a stone. He is seen assuring the others present in the library. Later, one of the youths who came from outside is seen sitting down with a book when police arrive. He has a scarf on his face and is seen in another video getting hit by the police.That 48-second clip shows police going on a rampage in the library, hitting those sitting there with sticks. Several of the cops have their faces covered.Mohammad Raabe, a BA Persian student said he was studying in the reading hall when “the police entered the building and began using tear gas to disperse students. They also broke down the library glass and furniture. Despite our pleas, they continued to beat us and abused us using communal slur. Several of us had never left the library and were studying. Even if police came looking for certain people, why were they beating so many of us.”Raghib Naushad, a member of the Jamia’s JCC, said, “We never denied that many students tried to block the doors of the library with the tables and chairs when they heard about what was happening outside. There were a few students who were protesting and ran into the campus. Seeing that it was a Sunday and the department buildings were closed, they entered the library which was open. The blatant disregard shown by the police and the violence they meted out on even those students who were not involved in any protest is unjustified.”On allegations of possible rioters entering the library building, Naushad asked, “Why did the police beat up all the students, and even the ones who were studying? Why did they destroy library property? And why would a stone-pelter carry a stone inside the library? The truth is that the police were going around beating random students in the campus with their faces covered.”Police officers say that the sequence of events after which police had entered the university has already been established and verified from the Jamia authorities, and a few of the miscreants have been identified. Efforts are being made to identify the rest.In Video: Video war over December 15 Jamia library violence",india,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74166448,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-86758,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/videos-of-police-action-inside-jamia-library-trigger-fresh-row/articleshow/74166447.cms

32,['17/02/2020'],Colleges miffed as govt pushes them to promote its schemes,"This story is from February 17, 2020

MUMBAI: Can publicising the language of a state or enrolling unorganised workers for a government pension scheme be a round-the-year activity for an IIT or an autonomous college? Leading educational institutions receiving grants from the Centre are weighed down by a peculiar problem: the HRD ministry has spelt out a rigorous schedule of “non-academic” activities which have to be carried out almost throughout the year, ranging from promotion of flagship missions such as Swachh Bharat to cultural activities such as language lessons and classical performances.

At a recent workshop in Delhi, social media coordinators from premier institutions such as IITs, IIMs and IISERs, among others, were not only asked to make extensive use of their Twitter handles to promote their own work but also endorse the ministry’s activities by retweeting their tweets regularly. An official from one of the IITs said they were asked to tweet several times a day to gain traction on social media. “While this is still doable, we are expected to hold a host of activities throughout and it is difficult to find students who can take time out of their busy schedule. Many directives come at the eleventh hour, making it tough for us to organize events and even if we manage, we are unable to show solid participation in the photographs,” said the IIT official.

A former IIT director said that the premier institutes find it difficult to organise cultural events. “Our students will have to be trained for those cultural events, but we do not have trainers for classical singing and dancing. Not many are willing to do these activities. The idea of holding such events could be gradually brought into the IIT system and it cannot happen overnight,” said the director.

Under the government’s campaign of Ek Bharat Shreshtha Bharat (EBSB), the ministry wants students to at least learn alphabets, 100 sentences, five songs and 20 proverbs in the language of a partner state. Maharashtra was paired with Odisha for this campaign, and students were expected to learn Odia through online mobile applications. They are also expected to take various pledges, including for the Swachhata campaign, national unity and single-use plastic in Odia. Students from Rajasthan are paired with Assam, Haryana with Telangana , and Himachal Pradesh with Kerala, and so on.

“Another plan under the EBSB was to hold a cultural exchange programme between paired colleges from Maharashtra and Odisha. A teacher and 50 students from each college were to visit Odisha for a week. But no one had a clue how to go about it. Mails to the programme officers in Delhi went unanswered. Much to our relief, the exchange plan was shelved but other programmes will still continue,” said a nodal officer from one of the Mumbai colleges.

In another bizarre activity, students from colleges funded under the Rashtriya Uchchatar Shikshan Abhiyan (RUSA) were asked to promote the Central government’s pension scheme in the unorganised sector. A RUSA official from Maharashtra said students can approach their domestic help, drivers, gardeners or watchmen to promote the scheme. While most activities are being asked of RUSA-funded colleges, many others are common for all higher education institutions.

A principal said colleges are expected to appoint a nodal officer for all such campaigns, submit a regular report and upload photos and videos on designated websites. “In January, the MHRD sent a circular asking all colleges to observe Swachhata Pakhwada. We were asked to hold close to 20 activities in a span of two weeks. The mail came just two days before January 16, when the campaign was supposed to kickstart. From plogging (the concept of picking litter while jogging) to plantation of trees, to developing innovative technologies for waste recycling, awareness campaigns, etc, everything was listed out for specific days and colleges were expected to give daily reports. It was practically impossible, but we still managed to do it for a few days,” said the principal.

“While the concept for holding these government campaigns is good, they cannot have prolonged activities. Events that can be completed in a day are stretched to a week or a month. The compulsion of submitting daily reports and uploading photos will soon make a mockery of the entire process. People will soon fabricate information to show compliance,” said a principal.

A senior MHRD official, though, said, “IITs and other higher education institutions are part of the government and these are national programmes meant for nation-building. These are constitutional values and national policies, which every government must insist on and every citizen must follow. There is no question of it being non-academic. For example, for Swachhata Pakhwada, can you say cleanliness is not my business? Look at it positively. It is the nation’s idea which is now coming out as government schemes and policies. We should all support it.” The official added that reporting the events is essential for monitoring the activities.

34,['17/02/2020'],India’s GST collections are below potential: IMF team,"(File photo)

NEW DELHI: Multiple rates, exemptions and implementation challenges are affecting goods and services tax (GST) collections in India, an analysis by an International Monetary Fund (IMF) team has said.The study of India’s resource mobilisation for next five years has estimated that in 2018-19, GST collections were 5.8% of GDP, which was better than some of the comparable developing countries, but far below the potential of 8.2% of GDP, indicating that the efficiency gains from the new regime have not fully accrued.“The IMF team has estimated that the compliance gap may be of the order of 40%,” a government official told TOI. The team included Ruud de Mooij, Arbind Modi , Li Liu, Dinar Prihardini, and Juan Carlos Benitez .While it blamed multiple factors for the divergence between actual collections and potential revenue, the assessment flagged exemptions such as those on food articles as an area of concern. Exemptions for food products alone are estimated to cost up to 0.4% of GDP, and it suggested that the government could look at a direct benefit transfer for the bottom of the pyramid segments to tackle this issue.In fact, a committee of Indian government officers had pointed out that exemptions available to food products were being misused and segments such as basmati rice companies had sought to deregister their brands to avoid paying taxes.The IMF team has also said that other design flaws — which include multiple rates, as opposed to one or two rates in most countries, and the threshold for businesses to be included in the GST net — reduced the revenue potential and the incentive for compliance. Besides, some of the issues created economic distortions, including refund problems.While there are four slabs — 5%, 12%, 18% and 28% — there are other rates for bullion and real estate apart from cesses on luxury and sin goods such as cars, tobacco and soft drinks adding to the complexity.It has also pointed to the debate about implementation challenges such as electronic filing or returns, e-way bills for transporting goods beyond a certain value and cross matching of invoices, which trade and businesses have argued are cumbersome and increase the compliance cost .With GST collections falling short of the target, the government is seeking to plug leakage and also fix some of the design issues, including the possibility of an upward revision in some of the slabs. While the last meeting of the GST Council rejected the demand for a rate revision, some of the issues are expected to be taken up at next month’s meeting of the ministerial panel.",business,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74166472,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-204110,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/indias-gst-collections-are-below-potential-imf-team/articleshow/74166471.cms

NEW DELHI: India used strong words to protest against UN secretary general Antonio Guterres who offered to facilitate dialogue between India and Pakistan on Sunday.

Responding to the “offer” by the top UN diplomat, the MEA spokesperson said, “Jammu and Kashmir has been, is and will continue to be an integral part of India. The issue that needs to be addressed is that of vacation of the territories illegally and forcibly occupied by Pakistan. Further issues, if any, would be discussed bilaterally. There is no role or scope for third-party mediation.”

Insisting that India’s position “has not changed”, the spokesperson said, “UN secretary general would emphasise on the imperative for Pakistan to take credible, sustained and irreversible action to put an end to cross-border terrorism against India, which threatens the most fundamental human right — the right to life, of the people of India, including in J&K.”

The UN secretary general’s remarks have gone down very badly within the Indian system because they were made as part of a question and answer session after Guterres’s talk in Islamabad on Sustainable Development and Climate Change. Guterres emphasised the need for protection of human rights in J&K. Although he tempered it by saying it was applicable everywhere in the world, India has taken umbrage because of where he delivered his comments and the context.

This is also not the first time Guterres has offered mediation, even though it has been perfectly clear that India would not welcome it. Guterres reportedly said both India and Pakistan should de-escalate “militarily and verbally” and exercise “maximum restraint”.

Guterres, who arrived in Islamabad on Sunday, met Pakistani foreign minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi . The UN chief is on a four-day visit to Pakistan during which he will attend an international conference on Afghan refugees and visit Gurdwara Kartarpur Sahib .

Rajkot: Attending the wedding of his cousin turned out to be fatal for a 20-year-old youth when a bullet carelessly fired by a participant got lodged in the head of Priyarajsinh Jadeja at Pachhegam village of Vallabhipur taluka in Bhavnagar district on Saturday.

39,['17/02/2020'],DDEs of Patna University and LNMU on verge of closure,"This story is from February 17, 2020

Patna University

PATNA: If the UGC has had its way, the directorate of distance education (DDE) of both Patna University (PU) and L N Mithila University ( LNMU ), which have so far been catering to the higher education needs of thousands of students in the state, will stop functioning from the next academic session. This will give a jolt to the government move to enhance the gross enrolment ratio (GER) in higher education, feel the academics.

According to the latest guidelines of the Distance Education Bureau (DEB), a statutory body of the UGC, only universities which are accredited by the National Assessment and Accreditation Council (NAAC) with A+ grade would now be eligible to run distance education centres under their jurisdiction. Needless to say, no university in the state is accredited with A+ grade.

Courses under DDE are mostly preferred by working professionals as they are not required to attend regular classes daily. Besides, students who fail to compete in the written entrance test for admission to the three-year degree courses in different colleges of PU, also secure their admission in DDE.

Established in 1974 as “Institute of Correspondence Courses” it runs honours courses in history, geography, English, Hindi, Urdu, and computer applications and commerce and postgraduate diploma courses in marketing management, financial management, library science, journalism and others.

Surprisingly, the courses running under DDE of PU had been derecognized by the DEB three years ago owing to certain deficiencies. Admission to all its courses remained suspended until its recognition was restored by DEB last year. PU fulfilled all the necessary requirements, including appointment of full-time faculty and establishment of study centres, demanded by DEB, said DDE director Deepti Kumari.

So far as the requirement of a separate building for the DDE is concerned, PU has recently decided to shift the institution from its existing location behind PU library to somewhere at Rani Ghat shortly. Earlier, the university had decided to get an independent campus developed for DDE at Saidpur complex.

In L N Mithila University, DDE was established in 1998 but it became functional in 2005 with the launch of BEd programme in collaboration with Indira Gandhi National Open University. The DDE is now offering several undergraduate and postgraduate courses, including professional programmes like BEd and Bachelor and Master of Library and Information Science with the approval of DEB and NCTE.

But the DDE of both PU and LNMU would cease to function if the UGC fails to change its condition of having A+ grade for the parent university. PU DDE chief Deepti Kumari said, “We have requested the UGC to reconsider its decision in view of the fact that a large number of youths desirous of pursuing higher education programmes would remain deprived of the opportunities in a backward state like Bihar . PU has been accredited by NAAC with B+ grade only recently and the grade can’t be improved soon.”

If the UGC remains rigid on its stand and allows the DDEs to die an unnatural death, the universities may move the court for finding a legal remedy in the larger interest of students, said a senior LNMU official.

KOLKATA: Though winter has left the city, the mercury continued to fluctuate in Kolkata on Sunday, unleashing another spate of attacks by season-change viruses that have been triggering cough-and-cold infections . Contrary to the Met office’s prediction, the minimum temperature plunged a degree to 16.1°C from Saturday’s 17.1°C. It could continue at 16°C on Monday as well, according to weathermen at the Regional Meteorological Centre (RMC), Kolkata.The northwesterly wind that had weakened over the past few days, gained momentum on Sunday, leading to the marginal drop in temperature, explained weathermen. It will make the temperature fluctuation continue for a few more days, they said.“But the minimum temperature will not drop below 15°C and the maximum will touch the 30°C-mark by the next weekend. It will get gradually warm, but there will be relatively cooler days in between,” said RMC director G K Das. On Sunday, Kolkata recorded a maximum temperature of 29.6°C.While rhino virus, human meta-pneumo virus and influenza virus are most commonly triggered by temperature fluctuation, it is difficult to identify them without tests, said experts.Even amid a Covid-19 scare, there has been a recurrence of the viral fever with severe cough that had struck in late-January. It has been affecting children more frequently.“Like last month, a persistent cough has struck scores of children over the week. In some cases, it is accompanied by fever. Those with a history of respiratory illnesses, like asthma, have been suffering more than the rest. Children are more vulnerable due to their low immunity and also due to the fact that they are more likely to catch an infection from their school or on public transport,” said paediatrician Shantanu Ray.According to consultant P K Nemani, the common viruses trigger similar symptoms which recede in three-five days. “But a bacterial infection can lead to complications and delay recovery. The elderly and the children are most vulnerable,” Nemani said.Consultant Arindam Biswas agreed. “Viral infections are often followed by bacterial ones, which could be dangerous, especially for the elderly. So, if the colour of the sputum changes or if fever refuses to subside in four-five days, consult a doctor to check if you need antibiotics,” he said.Seasonal viruses are highly contagious so an outbreak is difficult to prevent in the pre-winter period, felt Belle Vue Clinic critical care consultant Samarjit Naskar.“These viruses are transmitted through sneezes and cough droplets, which can travel six feet. So, public places and transport usually help spread them. The only option is to use masks and handkerchiefs and not touch objects with bare hands,” said Naskar.",kolkata,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74169699,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1031833,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/temp-swing-puts-kids-at-risk-from-infections/articleshow/74165396.cms
41,['17/02/2020'],Maharashtra: Low-income groups lose 10% reservation in RTE admissions,"This story is from February 17, 2020

Representative image

AURANGABAD: The state government has not made applicable the Economically Weaker Section (EWS) quota for admissions under the Right To Education (RTE) Act for 2020-21.

The move has sparked a backlash.

In January last year, the BJP-led government at the Centre had introduced a 10% EWS quota across the country for citizens in the general category with an annual income of less than Rs 8 lakh. The reservation was for those who do not belong to any reserved category, such as the SC/ST/OBC.

“The EWS quota was meant for education and jobs. It makes no sense for the government to exclude the RTE admissions from the 10% reservation. It is an unjust move by the government that will cause academic loss to students,” said Renuka Washikar, a parent.

Akhil Jain, another parent, said parents should now mount a legal battle against the state government. “Parents from the general category should join hands and take the state government to court,” he said.

A total of 9,328 schools across the districts of Maharashtra have registered for the online admission process under the RTE Act for 2020-21.

Dinkar Temkar, the state joint director of education (primary), said the EWS quota was not made applicable for the RTE admissions as the “weaker section” was already one of the target beneficiaries. “Children whose parents have an annual income of under Rs 1 lakh are considered beneficiaries of the RTE Act. Therefore, interests of part of the target population under the EWS quota are already protected during admissions under the RTE Act,” he said.

Temkar said instances of beneficiaries claiming the RTE quota by producing bogus income proof are already high and introduction of the EWS quota could make the admissions process murkier.

Education activists, however, refused to buy the explanation. “The Maharashtra government had ratified the EWS quota introduced by the Centre on February 12, 2019, making 10% reservation applicable in educational opportunities and jobs. The education department has no right to exclude admissions under the RTE Act from the EWS quota,” educational activist Tukaram Saraf said.

On apprehensions about bogus income documents, Saraf said it is the responsibility of the education department to thoroughly scrutinize the paperwork being submitted by parents.

Maharashtra school education minister Varsha Gaikwad did not respond to phone calls or text messages for her comments.

44,['17/02/2020'],"‘Enough is enough’, says NCW team in Bhuj college","This story is from February 17, 2020

NCW members talk to the girl students in the Bhuj institute on Sunday

RAJKOT: A team from the National Commission for Women (NCW) followed its state counterpart a day later into the Shree Sahjanand Girls Institute campus in Bhuj on Sunday, to understand the young hostelers’ plight from the monthly persecution.

An inquiry committee formed by the NCW to look into the matter, led by Dr Rajul L Desai, (member, NCW), along with advocate Malshree Gadhvi, DLSA, discussed with 44 girls (out of 68) and assured them of trying to dissuade the administration from following such inhuman practices.

Later, talking to the media, Desai shared her dismay saying, “The girls can’t stay in their room, can’t eat, sleep, mix with their peers and have to spend four nights in a dingy basement — why are the girls made to follow such rules in the 21st century? How is it appropriate for any educational institute to enforce such kinds of stringent religious restrictions? According to UGC guidelines, hostel, too, is considered to be part of the definition of an educational institute.”

Flaying the institute for heaping the rigorous practices on the young students, Desai admitted that the girl students were left with little option but to follow the diktats “if they wanted to study there”. The rules of the hostel are in violation of the girls’ right to education, which has been guaranteed to them by the constitution, she said.

“Imagine the plight of these girls — amid their physiological changes, they have to bear the psychological torment too, not only in being isolated but a mental pressure that follows them to their classrooms too!” Desai lambasted.

The team was further aghast to learn that the girls had no issues with the “monthly practice” but only from the way that they had been subjected to the strip test. “The girls require proper guidance about it. We will create a healthy mentality among the girls that they should not agree to follow such kind of archaic rules,” she said.

Desai also called for a legal awareness programme in the hostel auditorium where she created awareness among the girls about One Stop Centre, 181 Women Helpline and various other legal rights of the girls and women.

In-charge vice-chancellor of Kutch University , Darshna Dholakia , who was present in the meeting said she was unaware of any such rules.

The institute’s administration apprised the inquiry team that it too was unaware of such practices being followed in the hostel and that three female staff had already been suspended for the Monday’s strip test.

Talking to the teachers and trustees of the institute, the NCW team made it amply clear that they cannot impose any such harsh rules on the girls any more. A few of the victims who were not present on the campus on Sunday will be spoken to over the phone, NCW members said.

The wedding procession took place in Saripada village

PALANPUR: A 27-year-old man from Dalit community was forcibly alighted from a horse in his wedding procession, subjected to casteist slurs and allegedly beaten up in Saripada village, some 12 km from Palanpur on Sunday.

The victim Aakash Kotiya (Parmar), an army jawan, and others were on way to Sundha village in the wedding procession.

Police have booked 11 people under Prevention of Atrocities Against SCs & STs Act following a complaint lodged by Aakash’s granduncle Khema Kotiya.

According to the complaint, the accused on Sunday went to Kotiya’s house on learning that they were planning to take out Aakash’s marriage procession on a horse. After hurling casteist slurs at them, they allegedly threatened to shoot the groom if he went on a horse. “They told us that we had to take birth as upper caste people if we wanted to ride a horse. I pleaded with them that Aakash is an orphan and they allow the marriage procession to pass off peacefully, but they did not budge from their stand,” Khema told Gadh police in the complaint.

The victim family then called up the police control room to seek protection for the procession. However, when the procession reached a local dairy, the group of accused persons came there and dragged down Aakash from the horse. They allegedly even snatched his sword and then started thrashing him.

In the meantime, other accused resorted to stone pelting on the procession members a man named Hira Sekhaliya, a resident of Saambhi and woman Kusum Parmar of Ankodi were injured severely. Stones also damaged the DJ sound system, besides hurting a few other women who were playing garba in the venue, he said.

Dalpat Bhatia, president of Dalit Samaj of Banaskantha district, who helped the family lodged a complaint, said that the wedding celebrations were subjected to objections from day one.

Ranveer Bhatia, a Dalit activist said that they had to seek police protection apprehending further fracas on the wedding route besides harm on the baraatis after the upper caste people had already warned them not to take the procession through a particular street in the village.

Police arrangement has been tightened in the village, he added.

Those booked were Senji Koli, Shivji Koli, Dipakji Koli, Tusharji Koli, Bhavanji Koli, Jituji Koli, Vinodji Koli, Ramaji Koli, Dipakji Ishwarji Koli, Baibaben Koli and Manjuben Koli. They are all residents of Saripada village.

46,['17/02/2020'],Gaya residents rue lack of road safety measures,"This story is from February 17, 2020

GAYA: Residents of Gaya expressed serious concern over inadequate road safety measures like non-availability of trauma centres and blatant violation of traffic laws, including speed regulation, load regulation and less than required number of traffic signages at a road safety meeting held at the collectorate here.

What worried the road safety stakeholders was the fact that despite three national highways (No 02, 82 and 83) and equal number of state highways (No 04,07 and 08) criss-crossing Gaya district, trauma facility for accident victims was not available in the district. On an average, about 300 persons die in road accidents in the district every year and about 500 persons suffer serious injuries. According to activist Lalji Prasad, a sizeazble number of road accident deaths are preventable. Several people die on way to Patna as facilities for neurosurgery are not available in Gaya.

During the Saturday meet, Gaya DM Abhishek Singh said the trauma centre issue was being seriously addressed and the district will have at least two trauma centres. Whereas one trauma centre is being established on the Anugrah Narain Magadh Medical College (ANMMCH) premises, another trauma centre will be set up near Dobhi on NH-02-NH 83 intersection. “ANMMCH centre would shortly start functioning,” said Singh.

The stakeholders also expressed serious concern over relocation of electric poles. Several roads of the town including Church Road, Swarajpuri Road and Nazareth Academy Road have been widened and the road width has been increased by about three meters and the poles are yet to be relocated.

But in the absence of relocation of electric poles, crores of rupees spent on road widening has virtually gone down the drain as the motorable part of the road remains the same whereas poles have become accident prones and several fatal accidents have taken pkace on account of non relocation of electric poles.

A suggestion for making the electric cables under ground in the heavy traffic areas was made. Suggestion for the construction of fly overs to meet traffic congestion was also made. Gaya MP Vijai Manjhi chaired the meet.

The meet participants included Municipal Commissioner Sawan Kumar, Civil Surgeon Dr BK Singh, DTO Jitendra Kumar and activist Lalji Prasad.

PATNA: Altogether six people, including two members of a family, were killed in four separate incidents in the state during the last 24 hours on Sunday. While a father-son duo was killed in Saharsa, two deaths were reported from both Patna and Bhagalpur districts.

Reports reaching the police headquarters said that one Hardev Mandal (55), and his son Ramesh Mandal (25), were killed when they were returning home from Mahua Bazar on a motorbike in Saharsa district late on Saturday night. The assailants intercepted the father-son duo near Motibari under Basanhi police station and shot at them from point-blank range causing grievous injuries.

While Hardev died on the spot, his son Ramesh succumbed to his injuries during treatment at a private hospital in Madhepura district on Sunday. The deceased were stated to be residents of Laliya village under the Gwalpara police station in Madhepura district. The motorbike belonging to the deceased was seized from the spot.

Saharsa SP Rakesh Kumar said on Sunday that old enmity is stated to be the reason behind the double murder. “A joint team of the Saharsa and the Madhepura police is conducting raids to nab the assailants, who escaped after committing the crime. A case has been lodged against six people on the statement of the deceased’s relative Dilip Mandal,” he added.

In Patna, a 50-year-old man was found murdered near Chilbili village under the Phulwarisharif police station area on Sunday morning. The deceased, Rajeshwas Ravidas Ram, had gone missing from his residence since Saturday night. The family members told police that Rajeshwar had left home around 9 pm to meet a family acquaintance but didn’t return.

On Sunday morning, some local residents spotted his body lying in a wet land adjacent to the Badshahi drain on Kurkuri-Chilbili road. The body bore external injuries, which suggested that he was killed somewhere else and his body was dumped on the spot to mislead the police.

Phulwarisharif police station SHO Rafiq-ur-Rahman said the deceased, a daily wager, was a drug addict. The body was handed over to the relatives after postmortem at PMCH. The reason behind the incident is yet to be ascertained.

In another incident, a notorious gangster Vijay Yadav alias Bahra was shot dead by two youths riding a motorbike at Majha Bigha village under Pandarak police station in Patna rural. Police said the assailants attacked Bahra when he was sitting outside his house around 9.30 pm on Saturday. The deceased had criminal antecedents and was released from jail recently. A police officer posted at Pandarak police station said that Bahra was facing charges of murder, loot and extortion. The police said that the incident was a fallout of gang rivalry in Mokama Tal area.

In Bhagalpur, a 25-year-old youth, Lal Bahadur Yadav, was killed near Anjuganj Kumaith under the Sultanganj police station area late on Saturday night. DSP Neshad Ahmad Sah said that Lal Bahadur was serving as a private driver at a police station in the district.

Prima facie the incident appeared to be a fallout of love affair. An FSL team collected evidences from the spot from where Yadav’s body was recovered. The call details of his mobile phone are being obtained to trace the killers, the DSP added.

In another incident, a 17-year-old boy, Amit Kumar alias Nidhu, was killed near Sonbarsa under Bihpur police station on Sunday. Police said marks of bullet injuries were found on his back. His face also bore stab wounds. The deceased’s elder brother Sumit Kumar lodged a complaint against unidentified persons in connection with the incident.

As per the budgetary estimate, the university has an income component of Rs 158,30,68,574. The deficit of Rs 669,80,50,152 will be met by the state government.

The income side shows Rs 29.15 crore generated through tuition fee, registration fee, vocational education, sports charges and income generated by the university’s exam department. The exam department itself is likely to generate an income of more than Rs 25 crore. The university expects a grant of Rs 129.15 crore from higher education funding agencies.

As per the university’s budget papers, pension payment and post-retirement monetary benefits payable to employees reaching the age of superannuation consumes nearly half of the university’s budgetary allocations. Of Rs 838 crore budget, pension and other post-retirement benefits account for about Rs 377 crore.

As against pension and other post-retirement benefits like gratuity, earn leave and commutation, Rs 200.22 crore is to be spent on salary payment of regular employees. As against 1,779 employees on the university’s pay roll, the number of pensioners exceeds 4200. Of the 1,779 employees working at the university headquarters, two dozen PG departments, 19 constituent and one government-funded minority college, 564 are teachers and the remaining 1,215 employees belong to grade III, IV and lab personnel.

Asked about the extra large number of pensioners as compared to regular employees, registrar Sidhnath Prasad Deen said, “Besides its own pensioners, MU has to bear the pension burden of 17 colleges of Vir Kuer Singh University , Ara, and 25 colleges of Pataliputra University, Patna.

49,['17/02/2020'],Metiabruz plaques mark arrival of the last Nawab of Awadh in Kolkata,"The plaques being unveiled

KOLKATA: The Bengal government has put up two plaques to commemorate the arrival of Wajid Ali Shah , the banished nawab of Lucknow who was instrumental in introducing the Calcutta Biryani with its distinct taste that has swept gastronomes off their feet.On Friday, the West Bengal Heritage Commission (WBHC) unveiled two blue plaques — in Bengali and English — at Bichali Ghat in Metiabruz to denote the place where the nawab embarked. The event was attended by descendants of the nawab, the city’s heritage enthusiasts and officials of WBHC. Basudeb Mallick, officer-on-special-duty with WBHC, explained the significance of the blue plaque. “Nawab Wajid Ali Shah disembarked here on May 13, 1856. This installation was a move by Purono Kolkatar Galpo (PKG), a group of heritage enthusiasts who insisted on adding cultural and historical texts to places of historical importance in the city,” said Mallick.On May 13, 1856, the last nawab of Awadh reached Bichali Ghat after losing his estate and wealth to British conspiracy. He was greeted with a 21 gun salute and given an annual pension of Rs 12 lakh. He first resided at BNR House and, during the Sepoy Mutiny, he was kept under watch in Fort William. “After his release, the nawab did not want to return to Lucknow and started giving Mertiabruz some sense and flavour of the Lucknow he had left behind,” said Jayanta Sen of PKG.Swarnali Chattopadhyay of PKG said, “During numerous heritage walks, we found that there was no marker to point out the arrival of the nawab who added so much value to the cultural, culinary and literary ethos of the city. This is why we approached the heritage commission to put up a marker to remind daily commuters about the the history of the place.”Shahenshah Mirza, the nawab’s great great grandson, thanked the heritage commission for taking the initiative. “It is an important beginning. Many of the heritage structures associated with Wajid Ali Shah do not exist any more. But if markers are put up, our progeny can recognize the places and know the history of the city-within-a-city — the Chhoti Lucknow.”After the informal function, the attendees went to Sibtainabad Imambara, which was built by the nawab.",kolkata,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74172744,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-678635,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/metiabruz-plaques-mark-arrival-of-the-last-nawab-of-awadh-in-city/articleshow/74165427.cms

Representative image

BHOPAL: In an attempt to make things easier for parents of students studying in private schools, district education officer Nitin Saxena, alongwith other officials of the education department, held a meeting with private school principals at the Subhash Excellence School, T T Nagar, on Saturday. He directed the schools not to pressurize parents to buy books from one particular book shop and ensure that they give preference to NCERT books over books from private publishers as far as possible.

The schools were also asked not to change the books and finalize the list of prescribed books for the new academic session within 2-3 days.

Saxena said, “In the meeting, schools were directed to abide by the rules of the education department and CBSE by-laws or we will take strict action against them. Though we cannot make NCERT books mandatory in schools, we have directed them to stick to the NCERT books as far as possible and only use books by private publishers if necessary.”

Commenting on the issue, district collector Tarun Pithode said, “It is not fair to the parents when schools ask them to purchase books from one particular book store. School cannot pressurise parents to go to a particular book store and they are free to buy the books and note-books from any book-store of their choice.”

The parents, however, are now raising the issue that in order to abide by the rules and also use the books of private publishers, schools are now building pressure upon the parents to purchase NCERT books as well as those prescribed by the school.

“The education department did ensure that schools use NCERT books, but now parents have to spend double the amount as schools are using NCERT books as well as private publishers’ books. I don’t understand why schools need to use so many books for all subjects when NCERT covers the entire syllabus and is good enough for students to study from and take competitive exams. Indore collector has also issued orders for private schools to use NCERT books,” said Prabodh Pandya, secretary of Madhya Pradesh Parents’ Association.

J P Nadda

PATNA: BJP national president J P Nadda will arrive here on February 22 to fast pace the party’s preparedness for the assembly elections to be held later this year, party’s national general secretary incharge for Bihar Bhupender Yadav said here on Sunday.

During his one-day stay at Patna, Nadda will hold consultations with the party’s state core committee members to decide on the programmes to be taken up as a build-up to the October-November assembly elections, besides zeroing in on the strategy to be adopted by the BJP for the assembly elections.

“The NDA will go to the polls under the leadership of CM Nitish Kumar,” Yadav said, adding that the BJP would dedicate itself to ensuring that the NDA returned to power again with thumping majority.

Skirting the impact of the repeat sweep made by the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) in the recently held Delhi assembly elections on the prospects of the NDA in Bihar, Yadav said, “We respect the Delhi mandate. The Centre will cooperate with the Arvind Kejriwal government in all its development-related activities. People talk about federalism, but we believe in cooperative federalism.”

Yadav said Nadda would also inaugurate through remote control the newly constructed buildings of the party’s headquarters in 11 districts – Naugachhia, Bhagalpur, Siwan, Gopalganj, Arwal, Aurangabad, Sasaram, Samastipur, Lakhisarai, Saharsa and Sheohar.

Yadav was in Patna on Sunday to review the status of constitution of the 45 district executive committees and 1,064 mandal level committees.

Bhopal: Even as the stage is set for new BJP state president Vishnu Dutt Sharma to take charge of office at the party headquarters here on Monday, sources said that more organisational changes are likely and the saffron party has plans to promote a second line of command.

Sharma will reach Bhopal on Monday afternoon and take charge of office in presence of outgoing state president Rakesh Singh, former chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan, leader of Opposition (LoP) Gopal Bhargava, chief whip in assembly Narottam Mishra, Union ministers Narendra Singh Tomar, Faggan Singh Kulaste, Prahlad Singh Patel and BJP national general secretary Kailash Vijayvargiya, sources said.

“Newly-appointed president V D Sharma will assume charge at the BJP state headquarters at 4pm on Monday. All senior party leaders will be present on this occasion,” stated an official release. The BJP office has also been decked up for the event with posters welcoming Sharma and his supporters.

Hailing the decision to appoint Sharma as party chief, Chouhan said his appointment will promote young leadership in the party. He, however, said that there will be no change in the LoP’s post.

“Appointment of Sharma as state chief will strengthen the workers’ base. There were also reports about change of LoP, which are not true. Bhargava will remain on the post. The entire party has welcomed the decision to assign responsibility to an active and energetic young leader and there are no differences at all,” said Chouhan.

Rejecting Congress leader Digvijaya Singh’s remarks that Chouhan is upset over the appointment of Sharma as state chief, the former CM said that it is in Congress where fissures have been exposed again.

“The war of words between Jyotiraditya Scindia and CM Kamal Nath is causing harm to the public, while Congress leaders are busy pulling each other’s legs. The public is the loser due to the infighting in the ruling party,” Chouhan said.

Sources said that the appointment of Sharma was hinted by the national leadership when former national president Amit Shah announced in his Rajnagar public meeting during the Lok Sabha elections that “VD Sharma will be a big leader in the future”. Former state chief Rakesh Singh had also admitted on Saturday that he was aware of the ongoing changes in the party leadership in Madhya Pradesh.

The change in leadership may lead to a possible political upheaval in the Congress-ruled state. BJP had claimed that the Kamal Nath-led government can topple anytime. Former Union minister Uma Bharti has also praised the appointment of Sharma and said, “In his able leadership, BJP will return to power in the state.”

HYDERABAD: Environmentalists have criticised the choice of species being selected for replantation in Hyderabad. ""The authorities give permissions for felling but in most cases, they fail to monitor the trees that are supposed to be replanted. Officials should also monitor if saplings are being planted deep enough to withstand strong winds or rain,"" said Ravi Kishore, an environmentalist.

Sharing a picture of royal palm, a garden plant that was recently planted to replace trees that were chopped down in Nallagandla, Vata Foundation, an organisation that helps in translocation of trees tweeted, ""A Pelto supports large variety of bird life. What does a Royal Palm support? Nallagandla trees replaced with useless varieties. Can the street get back better plantations please?""

MM Hussain, vice-chairman of Hyderabad Nurseries Consortium and former general secretary of Indian Nurserymen Association, said, ""While Hyderabad is packed with a variety of tree species, only native trees of the region like neem, pogada and peepal are suitable and have the capacity to withstand such heavy winds.""

A forest official, on condition of anonymity, said, ""We follow certain guidelines while giving permissions to cut down trees. Re-plantation is a must and we monitor the species being replanted.""

AHMEDABAD: A Vastrapur resident on Saturday filed a complaint with city police alleging that two persons, who introduced themselves as soldiers, have cheated him of Rs 5.81 lakh after he put a billing machine on sale on a e-commerce portal.

In his FIR with Vastrapur police, Dipak Joshi , 26, who recently completed MBA, stated that he had on December 9, 2019 put a billing machine for sale on the website.

On December 10, 2019, he received a call from the first accused who introduced himself as one Vikas Patel and told Joshi he works as soldier at the army cantonment and will pay Rs 10,000 through UPI merchant card, states the FIR.

Patel also sent his identity card and army cantonment smart card and sent a QR code to Joshi telling him to scan it and get his payment. When Joshi scanned the code for the first time, he lost Rs 5,000. But Patel managed to convince him that there was some technical glitch and kept sending QR codes and Joshi, following Patel’s instructions, scanned each time and ended up losing Rs 75,000 in total on December 11, 2019, states the FIR.

Patel told Joshi that he would return the money in cash. On December 13, 2019, another man — Suraj Ram, who introduced himself as a soldier who is deployed at Mumbai airport, called up Joshi and told him that Patel had cheated him and if Joshi wanted to get his money back, he would have to scan the QR codes sent by Ram. Joshi again followed Ram’s advice and this time he ended up losing Rs 1.79 lakh.

As if this was not enough, Ram convinced Joshi to send his entire saved money to Ram’s account so that it would not be taken by any fraudster. Joshi sent Rs 3.37 lakh more to Ram’s account and he ended up losing a total of Rs 5.81 lakh to the two fraudsters.

When Joshi contacted the two, they threatened him and refused to return any money.

Joshi then approached Vastrapur police and filed a complaint of cheating and breach of trust under IPC along with charges of Information Technology Act.

JAIPUR: State BJP president Satish Poonia described chief minister Ashok Gehlot as the leader of the ‘tukde-tukde’ gang in the wake of his participation at a sit-in here against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act.

Addressing a press conference on Sunday, he said Gehlot has “attempted to push the state into anarchy” in the name of freedom of speech sand expression. “The chief minister’s participation has encouraged such protests across the state. There have been reports that the protests are being funded by Popular Front of India (PFI) and the organisation has a connection with SIMI,” he said.

“All these indicate that there is a network working behind such protests. I don’t have any inhibition in saying that Rajasthan chief minister is the leader of ‘tukde-tukde’ gang,” he said, adding that Gehlot’s act was “shameful” as it aimed at taking political mileage.

Addressing the indefinite dharna against the CAA and NRC at the Shaheed Smarak on Friday, Gehlot had claimed that information on birthplace of parents was being sought for the National Population Register (NPR).

“If I am not able to furnish the details, I too would be asked to live in a detention centre. You stay assured, if such situation comes then I would be the first to go there,” he had said.

Poonia said the chief minister’s effort to equate Shaheed Smarak to Shaheen Bagh was an ‘insult’ to martyrs.

HYDERABAD: Andhra Pradesh chief minister and YSR Congress Party chief YS Jaganmohan Reddy is likely to send industrialists-cum-politicians Alla Ayodhya Rami Reddy and Beeda Masthan Rao, and minister Mopidevi Venkataramana to the Rajya Sabha in order to fill four seats that will fall vacant in March.

Sources in YSR Congress told TOI that Rami Reddy of Ramky Group, unsuccessfully contested as party nominee from Narsaraopet Lok Sabha constituency in Guntur in the 2014 general elections, however, Jagan couldn’t accommodate him during the 2019 polls. Despite failing to get a seat, Rami Reddy stood with the party as two of his relatives — MLA Alla Ramakrishna Reddy and former MLA Modugula Venugopal Reddy— are members of the party.

In December 2019, former MLA Beeda Masthan Rao from Nellore had quit TDP and joined the ruling YSR Congress. Masthan Rao, a Backward Classes (BC) leader, was elected MLA twice, but lost in 2009 and again failed to win in the Lok Sabha polls in 2019. In 2018, the income tax department conducted searches on BMR Group, which is owned by Masthan Rao and his family.

Mopidevi Venkataramana, who hails from the fishing community , and is a BC leader from Guntur, was made MLC as he lost Repalle assembly constituency to TDP. Mopidevi is currently AP’s animal husbandry and fisheries minister.

A senior party functionary told TOI, “YSR Congress has a policy of giving half of the nominated posts to BCs, SCs, STs and minorities. In that case, of four, only two posts can be given to these communities while the remaining two will go to the others. A decision in this regard will be taken by party chief YS Jaganmohan Reddy.”

Asked if the party was in talks with BJP over seat-sharing, party spokesperson Ambati Rambabu said, “There is no question of seat-sharing with BJP for Rajya Sabha polls. These are mere speculations. We, like any other government, would be seeking funds from the Centre for the state’s development.”

Bhopal: Amidst the confusion over fate of the ambitious ""Mukhya Mantri Teerth Darshan Yojana' for senior citizens launched by the Shivraj Singh government, state’s spiritual department minister, PC Sharma assured on Sunday that the `pilgrimage scheme' would continue.

The confusion arose out of a statement of GAD minister Govind Singh said that he was not in favour of continuing the pilgrimage scheme because of its misuse and excessive financial burden on the cash strapped government.

The statement has led to a war of words between the Congress and the BJP.

""I am not in favour of `Teerth Darshan'. People wearing suits and ties in the guise of poor, are enjoying the travel at the cost of state's fund. Better these funds be used on health and education-related works,"" Govind Singh told reporters on Sunday, adding, ""The blessings of God can be sought only when people spend their hard-earned money on pilgrimage.”

The BJP though, refused to buy the argument saying Congress government has been involved in overspending, but for poor public the government sans funds. “This is an ambitious scheme launched by previous BJP government to help poor fulfil their wish to go on pilgrimage. But, Congress is against the people and making excuses in the name of financial crisis,"" said Shivraj Singh Chouhan, who had launched the scheme during his tenure as chief minister.

The scheme was started by the then BJP government in 2012. Residents above 60 years of age are eligible to go on a pilgrimage to religious places of their choice, for which the state government bears the expenses. Sources disclosed that the Congress government has to pay Rs 17 crore as dues to the IRCTC for expenses and fare incurred on Teerth Darshan Yojana. After this, the government's spiritual department cancelled pilgrimage trains scheduled between February 15 and March 2 under the scheme, citing unavoidable circumstances.

On Sunday, minister Sharma, who holds the responsibility to run the scheme, intervened and asserted that the scheme was not going to be scrapped and the pilgrimage trains were cancelled due to some technical reasons.

“The scheme will be continued. Currently, exams are going on (in schools and colleges). Some other technical issues are there. But, a new schedule for the pilgrimage would soon be released,” said Sharma.

The BJP took a dig at the contradictory statements of two ministers in the Kamal Nath-led Congress government. ""The entire Congress government is confused. Nobody knows who is running the government,” said BJP MLA from Huzur (Bhopal), Rameshwar Sharma.

63,['17/02/2020'],Jaipur: More teeth for sampark portal in districts,"This story is from February 17, 2020

JAIPUR: Following chief minister Ashok Gehlot ’s directions to the collectors to ensure that nobody comes to the capital for minor works, the districts are making sure that the grievances related to people are redressed at the lowest level by ‘revamping and strengthening the monitoring system of the government’s Sampark portal’ and ‘increasing manpower to monitor it’.

The functioning of L-1 officers, who are the first-level officers authorised to redress the grievances, will be monitored, and they will be further sensitised.

“More officials will be appointed for better monitoring of Sampark portal, where complaints and grievances are lodged, in some districts. In all the districts, the cell monitoring Sampark portal will be revamped and strengthened further by increasing manpower,” said an official.

In Jaipur, a dedicated cell with adequate manpower has already been set up for constant monitoring of the Sampark portal. In the district (Jaipur), 51,000 grievances have been redressed in the past three months (since December 5). In December, 27,000 complaints were pending at the district level. Currently, the pendency is 13,000. On an average, 500 complaints are received each day and the monthly average is around 16,000.

Another official said, “Now, we have to check those complaints/ grievances, where the complainant is not satisfied with the remarks of the departments and ensure that his/her grievances are addressed. So, these complaints will be reviewed by us where the applicants are not satisfied with the disposal of the departments.”

“The complaints are already being monitored, but now we have to go one step ahead and check the number of grievances pending at the level of the departments. We will also have to see why the applicants are not satisfied with the remarks of the departments. This should be made a matter of priority and the system can be improved,” he added.

“If the complaints are redressed properly by the L-1 officers, then the applicants will not approach the next level (L-2, L-3) officers. If they still don’t take appropriate action, they will be chargesheeted and taken to task,” the official said.

After the chief minister’s video conference with the collectors on Friday, Sawar tehsildar Radheshyam Meena was suspended for negligence in disposal of complaints received at the chief minister’s office (CMO). Three officials were issued 16 CCA notices. The officials were Nagar parishad commissioner Hanumangarh; assistant engineer, Arnod, Pratapgarh and Pratapgarh superintendent engineer (power department). Stating that it was matter of serious concern that people were still coming to the capital to resolve small issues, the chief minister on Friday said responsibility of negligent officials in such cases must be fixed.

Meerut: Days after a massive protest by students of Chaudhary Charan Singh University (CCSU) in Meerut over the alleged gangrape of a 20-year-old MBA student, senior officials who have already refuted allegations of rape, now claimed that they are waiting for the girl’s statement before a magistrate, following which action will be taken.

“The statement of the rape survivor under section 164 of CrPC is yet to be recorded in front of magistrate following which further action will be taken,” Praveen Tripathi, inspector general (Meerut range) told TOI on Sunday.

Meanwhile, accused named in the FIR were detained by the police and interrogated and their statements have been recorded. The rape survivor’s family had claimed that their daughter was abducted and later gangraped by four youths when she was on her way back home at Garhmukteshwar in Hapur district on February 13.

The rape survivor’s family claimed that they had last spoken to their daughter after the bus she had boarded on Thursday evening broke down on its way to Hapur from Meerut. “We were expecting her to return in an hour’s time since we last spoke. But, she never showed up. When we later approached the police, surveillance pointed her location to Chandpur area in Bulandshahr,” elder brother of the rape survivor said.

The police have categorically denied the claims of rape, though. “During investigation, it was found that the girl went with her friend on her own, both are adults. She got injured after she fell from a bike. Rape has not been confirmed in the medical report,” IG Tripathi had said.

However, alleging police inaction, hundreds of students of CCSU had gathered in front of the office of inspector general of police in the Civil Lines area on Friday morning and staged a sit-in. The protest witnessed a lot of sloganeering by students, despite repeated attempts by the senior police officials to pacify the agitating students.

Bareilly: The Bareilly Municipal Corporation (BMC) will soon develop a 3km stretch of road connecting Gandhi Park in Civil Lines with Choupla as a model. Officials at BMC said the existing road will be widened and beautified with tree plantations, installation of LED street lights, construction of footpaths, after encroachments along the stretch are removed and illegal hoardings and banners pulled down. The road will be developed on the lines of the stretch between Rajendra Nagar crossing and Sheel crossing, which was developed by BMC last year.

BMC executive engineer (construction department) Sanjay Chauhan said, “A 3km-stretch connecting Gandhi Park with Choupla crossing has been selected for beautification and developing into a model road. Beautification includes road-widening, construction of footpaths, plantation on both sides and installation of LED streetlights, ahead of which, eviction drive will be carried out to remove encroachments, shops, illegal hoardings, banners and posters on electric poles, along roads, etc.”

Officials at BMC said the road was selected as it is a prominent one passing through the heart of the city, and yet suffers from rampant encroachment, which has made it into an ugly spectacle, while reducing road space. Beautification and installation of LED street lights will enhance the area’s look, they said.

Chauhan added, “The road connects prominent areas like Chowki crossing, Civil Lines, Ayub Khan, Choupla, etc, and is thronged by thousands of people round the clock, as it is lined with shops. Giving it a facelift will enhance the area. The plan is at an initial stage, but soon, an estimate will be prepared.”

Last year, BMC had undertaken Rs 6 crore-worth beautification of a stretch of around 120ft, connecting Rajendra Nagar to Sheel crossing, into a model stretch. The Gandhi Udyan-Choupla road will be the city’s second model road.

67,['17/02/2020'],Chennai: Resistance wells up at Washermenpet,"This story is from February 17, 2020

Chennai’s Shaheen Bagh, has transformed into a celebration of rebellion, scale and diversity

CHENNAI: On any other day, having to navigate a colossal crowd in the cramped bylanes of Washermenpet ’s Lala Gunda neighbourhood isn’t something you would wish upon yourself.

But ever since Friday — when police allegedly lathicharged anti-CAA protesters of the neighbourhood — the locality, now dubbed Chennai’s Shaheen Bagh , has transformed into a celebration of rebellion, scale and diversity. The more, the better – that is the spirit in the air.

Pedestrians walking back home along Vijayaragavalu Main Road, drivers from the local autorickshaw stand, curious shopkeepers, the neighbourhood milkman – there’s no one who witnesses the sit-in protests on Sajja Munusamy Street and Aziz Mohamed Street, and isn’t compelled to join in. “I’m declining rides after 8pm this evening so that I can go there,” says an auto rickshaw driver from the area. “In the past two decades, since I’ve driven around here, I haven’t seen something like this.”

Taking a cue from their sisters at Shaheen Bagh, the women of north Chennai – teens, young mothers and grandmothers numbering thousands – are on the frontlines. There’s nonstop flow of water bottles and steaming cups of chai for sore throats as they shout in repetition with Campus Front of India (CFI) leaders’ power-packed Tamil slogans like ‘engaludaiya porattam, eppovume verithanam’ (our cause of protest is always a hit). And amidst giggles, they clarify Hindi pronunciations to sing the anthem of ‘Azadi’.

“Hum cheen ke lenge azadi (we will snatch our freedom),” cries 13-year-old Shenaz (name changed). She hasn’t gone to school in two days and her mother Yasmin says she will sit through many more days if necessary. “It’s a question of her future here, so school can wait,” says Yasmin. “Most of us have voter IDs and Aadhaar cards. But our ancestors were illiterate and came from remote villages of Tamil Nadu. Many of them are dead. Their birth and citizenship documents can’t be the ticket to our future in this country,” she says.

For many women, this release of voice is new-found and cathartic. “We usually don’t even talk aloud with our family members. But now, we know we have to take the lead,” says Fathima (name changed), a 26-year-old protestor from RK Nagar who has been joining the Washermanpet protests for the last three days.

Even as many protesters attribute the information they have on CAA , NPR and NRC to their jamath (local congregation), they point out that no one in authority has come forward to explain more. “Where are all the AIADMK members who came to our homes in RK Nagar ahead of elections? Why aren’t they coming to reassure us that our futures are safe,” asks Fathima.

The protests begin in the wee hours of the morning after the namaz, and as it hits the peak hours, young men wearing badges of Ambedkar’s face, clear the way for traffic, while other volunteers form a human chain to keep crowds from spilling over to the main road. A community hall in the locality has been stocked up with food, supplies and a corner earmarked for women to feed their infants and change their diapers. WhatsApp messages asking for food donations have begun circulating.

As B Rashid, a casual worker from Washermenpet, handholds his wife to the side of women protesters, carrying his four-year-old boy on his shoulders, he says, “I want him to see what’s happening. I want him to be able to fight for his rights. We’re not backing down.”

68,['17/02/2020'],Hyderabad: Spoofing apps used to extort money from prominent netas,"This story is from February 17, 2020

Illustration used for representational purpose.

HYDERABAD: A probe into a high-profile extortion racket has startled investigating agencies, revealing that the accused were using spoofing applications (apps) to impersonate and imitate phone numbers of CBI, ED, various ministries and judges of the Supreme Court to con people.

Using the spoofing tools, the con artists allegedly extorted Rs 5 crore from a prominent politician of Tamil Nadu by promising to get her bail in the Supreme Court. Using the spoofing apps , available on Google Play and App Store, the accused calls up his/her target and the person, who receives the phone call, ends up thinking the calls have come from senior officers and judges.

“Multiple spoofing apps are available online. Initially, they are free for a few days, and then they charge. The user can depict another person's phone number and make calls or send text messages,” said cyber security expert and superintendent of police (CID), Andhra Pradesh, U Rammohan told TOI.

Shockingly, the applications could be used to imitate voice too, the expert added.

“Analysis of the call data record of the victim, will show IP addresses as the call is generated through the internet, while CDR of the person whose number is imitated shows nothing,” he added.

The mastermind of the extortion racket, who had his men across the country is on the run, but investigations revealed that the extorted money was diverted to the United Arab Emirates through hawala channels.

CBI had on January 18 arrested doctor and an industrialist Yala Manivardhan Reddy and Selvam Rama Raj, an NRI from Malaysia, for assisting the mastermind in extorting money from politicians , industrialists and bureaucrats, accused in fraud cases in Andhra Pradesh, Telangana and Tamil Nadu.

CBI, in the FIR, said Manivardhan Reddy and Selvam Rama Raj were arrested while extorting money from former TDP MP Rayapati Sambasiva Rao.

Rao is an accused in a CBI case, where his company Transstroy allegedly defrauded banks. They threatened him in the name of CBI officers.

Sources in CBI said the accused had collected Rs 10 crore, including Rs 5 crore from a prominent politician in Tamil Nadu. The accused reportedly posed as an SC judge and collected Rs 5 crore promising bail.

“Initially certain apps and websites providing such features were banned, but they mushroomed again. Even if they are banned, criminals can use them from other countries,” Rammohan added.

The subway on Anna Salai was shut for metro rail work

CHENNAI: Inordinate delay in reopening twin subways on Anna Salai has put pedestrians at risk . Located within of 250m between Anna Flyover and Thousand Lights Junction, the facilities were shut for metro rail work on the arterial road.

M Jayalakshmi, a flower vendor and resident of Thousand Lights, said she was forced to shell out Rs 40 for an auto rickshaw to cross the road after alighting at the Church Park bus stop.

“Many senior citizens like me who cannot walk longer distance and school students have been affected due to the closure of the subway for about two years. Some risk their lives by jaywalking at the end of Anna Flyover to cross the road,” she said. “We are being told by authorities that the subway will be reopened every month, but the shutters are down,” she said.

In the absence of pedestrian subways, people have to walk till the traffic signal at the Anna Flyover junction and cross the road. Those coming from Greams Road should reach the Whites Road-Anna Salai Junction to cross the road. Pedestrian are allowed to cross if the traffic police open barricades at the Peters Road Junction for vehicles coming from Teynampet to Royapettah to take a right turn. However, pedestrians said there was little scope for movement because of continuous passage of vehicles.

Jayakumar, a resident of Buddi Begam Street off Anna Salai said work is on at snail’s pace since renovation began over a year ago. “Office-goers are the worst hit because it is extremely difficult to cross the road given the number of vehicles plying on it,” he said.

The state highways department is renovating the two pedestrian subways at a financial outlay of Rs 1.2 crore each. The subways have CCTV cameras. While the highways department has missed multiple deadlines since June last year, official sources said one contractor had quit midway.

When contacted, highway department sources said installation of CCTV cameras in the subway near Anna Flyover was complete. “We have installed six CCTV cameras and work is in progress to install another set of six cameras in the second subway. Work will be complete in three days and both the facilities will be thrown open for the public by next week,” the official said.

Bareilly: A man lost nearly Rs 70,000 from his two bank accounts after he reportedly installed an application on his mobile phone following instructions of a tele-caller who pretended to be calling from Paytm in Lakhimpur city.

Notably, Paytm has already sent clear instructions to all users that it doesn’t make any calls for account details. An FIR has been registered under IT Act at Lakhimpur Kotwali police station. Cyber cell experts said that the duped money has been used for online shopping and they are trying to track the people involved in the crime.

Amit Kumar, a medical representative, received a call from unidentified number that he would be eligible for some offers if he downloads and upgrade an application. Relying on the words of the unknown caller, Kumar downloaded the application by clicking on the link sent by the caller and filled his personal information. Sometime later, he started receiving messages from his phone that nearly Rs 70,000 from his two bank accounts were taken out.

When Kumar called up his bank customer service, he was told that his money was used for purchasing some products online. Kumar immediately blocked both his accounts and informed the police about the matter.

SHO Kotwali police station Ajay Mishra said, “People can always register their FIR online through UPCOP application or they can login to cybercrime.gov.in to ensure timely response in such cases.

Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman

HYDERABAD: Rebutting Telangana government’s claim about the Centre not allocating adequate funds to the state, Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Sunday said the Centre has not discriminated against the state in any manner.

According to expenditure secretary TV Somanathan, the transfer of funds from the Centre to Telangana has been, in fact, much higher as compared to many other states during the 14th Finance Commission period (2015-2020). “The increase in the transfers from general taxes and grants is 128%. This is one of the highest ratios … and as the finance minister pointed out the percentage of devolution is not decided by the finance ministry but by the finance commission, which is an independent body ...,” he said, adding that the devolution increased from Rs46,747 crore in the earlier Finance Commission period to Rs1,06,606 crore in the 14th Finance Commission period (2015-2020).

Whatever is due as per the recommendations of the 14th Finance Commission for the current year have been devolved in the correct proportion and there is no shortfall, he added.

Besides, he also said that Telangana is one of the few states that has been allowed 0.5% extra fiscal deficit as part of its borrowings this year.

Over the last week, Telangana IT and industries minister KT Rama Rao and the FM have traded barbs over this issue, with the state minister stating that the Centre has received over Rs2.73 lakh crore from Telangana through taxes but Telangana has received only Rs1.13 lakh crore in return over the last five years.

Chief minister Ashok Gehlot and deputy chief minister and PCC chief Sachin Pilot and congress workers

JAIPUR: Several Congress workers gathered at the Collectorate Circle to protest the ‘ anti-reservation stance ’ of the Bharatiya Janata Party-led government at the Centre on Sunday. After the protest, Congress party also gave a memorandum to the governor Kalraj Mishra. The memorandum is addressed to the President of India.

Addressing the workers, chief minister Ashok Gehlot said, “As soon as the Supreme Court observation on reservation came out, Congress president Sonia Gandhi and leader Rahul Gandhi asked everyone to oppose it.”

“If given a chance, the BJP-led government may announce scrapping of reservation the way they introduced demonetisation,” Gehlot said.

He alleged that BJP has been terming the protesters as ‘Pakistanis’. “It is evident that imposing CAA and NRC is a move to disturb peace and harmony in the country. BJP, while forming the government for the second time got 39 per cent of votes, still it appears their government at the Centre is on a spree to destroy the peace and harmony of the country through their disastrous agenda,” he added.

He added that reservation has been given to SCs, STs, OBCs and other classes by the Indian Constitution and Congress party will not let BJP-led government at the Centre to scrap it.

Speaking at the occasion, deputy chief minister and PCC chief Sachin Pilot said, “Reservation is a tool given in the Constitution for the upliftment of marginalised sections of the society. We will continue our fight and we will stand for our marginalised brothers and sisters.” He accused the central government of adopting an anti-reservation stance and said, “The central government is deliberately weakening the cases of reservation in the courts.”

“Our dharna is meant to alert the BJP government at the Centre as no ideology or power can abolish the basic rights of the citizens of the country. Babasaheb Ambedkar had made a provision for reservation so that the standard of living could be improved by connecting the Dalits and backward with the main stream,” he added.

AICC, general secretary and state in-charge Avinash Pande said that the Congress is always ready to fight for the interests of the common man, whether it is the issue of reservation or inflation, to provide justice to the unemployed people.

Representational Image

HYDERABAD: A police constable , who had gone to inspect a fatal accident and clear traffic snarl, fell to his death from a bridge at the accident spot in Karimnagar on Sunday morning. Two persons, including the constable, died in a span of a few hours at Alaganur bridge on Manair river.

Constable B Chandrasekhar, 55, lost his life while inspecting the road accident involving school teacher, G Srinivas, 40, who lost control over his car and the vehicle fell off the bridge in Karimnagar town.

Around 9.15am, a Blue Colts team of Karimnagar I Town police station, comprising constable Chandrasekhar and a home guard, received an alert from ‘Dial 100’ about a road accident at Alaganur bridge, assistant commissioner of police (ACP), Karimnagar P Ashok said.

The Blue Colts team rushed to the accident spot. “The car, driven by school teacher G Srinivas, crashed into the bridge railing when a speeding truck rammed into it from the rear. The car plunged into the river, which hardly had any water. Srinivas, who was driving the car, died on the spot. His wife Swaroopa suffered severe injuries,” the ACP added. Srinivas and his wife were heading to Komuravelli Mallanna temple in Siddipet district when the accident occurred.

Minuters after getting the alert, Chandrasekhar along with other police personnel reached the accident spot and started regulating traffic.

“After some time, Chandrasekhar went to the bridge’s damaged cement railing to look at the car and the rescue effort. He leaned on to the railing to look at the car. The rickety railing moved and Chandrasekhar lost balance and fell off the bridge at 9.32am. Immediately, our staff reached him, brought him up and rushed to a hospital in an ambulance by 9.59pm. While undergoing treatment, he succumbed to injuries,” Karimnagar police commissioner V B Kamalasan Reddy said.

After the accident, the truck driver abandoned the vehicle and fled from the scene. “We have booked a case of culpable homicide not amounting to murder under Section 304 (ii) of the IPC against the truck driver,” the commissioner said.

Constable Chandrasekhar of the 1990 batch is survived by wife and two children — a widowed daughter who is a government employee, and a son who is an unemployed engineering graduate.

The police launched a manhunt to nab the truck driver.

Seven MLAs out of a total eight are yet to fully utilise their funds for Bijnor's development

BIJNOR: Eleven months into financial year 2019-20, at least Rs 7.74 crore of MLA development fund remain unutilized in Bijnor. Most of the MLAs, according to officials, have not taken much interest in spending the funds even as several roads of the district are dotted with potholes, among other infrastructural issues .

Seven MLAs out of a total eight are yet to fully utilise their funds - an amount of Rs 18 crore was allocated to eight MLAs and one MLC for Bijnor’s development. Each MLA and MLC is allotted Rs 2 crore every year for development work, as per the norms. Only Rs 10.26 crore has been used so far. A huge chunk of such funds are usually used in construction of roads, solar lights, sheds at bus stands and schools.

According to available data in District Rural Development Agencies (DRDA), Dhampur MLA Ashok Rana has utilised Rs 99.56 lakh out of Rs 2 crore, Bijnor MLA Suchi Chaudhary utilised Rs 115.50 lakh, Chandpur MLA Kamlesh Saini used Rs 62.17 lakh, Barhapur MLA Sushant Kumar Singh Rs 173.12 lakh, Najibabad MLA Tasleem Ahmed Rs 134 lakh and Nagina MLA Manoj Paras Rs 54 lakh. Nehtaur MLA Om Kumar has utilised the entire fund amount. Besides, state minister and MLC Ashok Katariya used only Rs 70 lakh out of Rs 2 crore.

There are eight assembly segments in Bijnor districts. Five of them - Bijnor, Dhampur, Chandpur, Nehtaur and Barhapur - were won by BJP candidates while three - Najibabad, Nagina and Noorpur - were won by the Samajwadi Party (SP).

Interestingly, the DRDA has written to the lawmakers several times reminding them of the fund use. On Sunday, junior engineer of DRDA Charan Singh said, “There are eight MLAs and an MLC in Bijnor. In the current financial year of 2019-20, a total amount of Rs 18 crore was released to all MLAs and MLC by the government for development. The MLAs and MLC exhausted Rs 10.26 crore while the rest is lying unused. Several letters were sent to these representatives with an urge to submit their proposals for the same.”

State minister and MLC, Ashok Katariya, told TOI, “I have submitted all development proposals recently. Entire fund will be exhausted soon.” While SP MLA from Nagina reserved seat, Manoj Paras, said, “We are preparing a proposal as per the public’s requirement. Soon, it will be submitted. I was in jail for eight months out of 11 months. I am trying my best to develop my assembly segment.”

TRS MLC and government whip Karne Prabhakar (Photo credit: Telugu Samayam)

HYDERABAD: TRS has hit back at BJP stating that the government followed protocol for Metro rail corridor inauguration and asked the saffron party not to make unnecessary allegations to derive political mileage.

TRS MLC and government whip Karne Prabhakar on Sunday said Union minister of state for home G Kishan Reddy was invited for the JBS-MGBS Metro rail corridor inauguration and that the photo of Prime Minister Narendra Modi was also carried in advertisements given to the print media.

“What the central government has given for Metro project is just Rs 1,200 crore. The cost of the project is over Rs 14,000 crore. The Centre has to give 10% funds, but the releases so far have been less than 10%. The Centre has not done any great out of the way favour to the state as is being done to BJP-ruled states,” Prabhakar said.

He said Kishan Reddy and other BJP members should prevail upon the Centre to get more funds for Hyderabad Metro and ensure national status was granted to Kaleswaram irrigation project, if the saffron party was really interested in the state’s development. He said they will felicitate Reddy if he was able to bring any prestigious project to Telangana . “Kishan Reddy should withdraw his words that the Centre will not give funds to Telangana.”

Rampur: Days after 26 people, who were arrested for protesting against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), were released after the Rampur district and sessions court granted them bail, 17 more protesters walked out of the district jail on Saturday evening.

The gate of the district jail was opened around 10pm and the protesters walked out amid warm welcome by their families and friends, who gathered in a large number. The protesters were arrested during the December 21 protests taking place at Hatikhana Square and Bareilly Gate road here.

Advocate Muhammad Rehman Ali said, “Nine protesters are yet to be released, as the court order did not match with the jail records.”

Ashraf Ali, a resident of Durganagla village, who had come to receive his three sons, told TOI, “My sons Afroz, Nazim and Azharuddin had gone to visit an exhibition. However, on their way home, they were arrested. Three days after their arrest, we came to know about it.”

Ali said, “Only Azharuddin is being released, while Afroz and Nazir will hopefully be released on Monday as there is some confusion about their names and the sections under which they were booked.”

Suleyman, a Rampur resident, had come to receive his younger brother Rizwan, a BSc third-year student, who was arrested during the protests.

Representative image

MADURAI: Madras high court has quashed the trial court proceedings against a former panchayat president accused of misappropriating money, saying the police had filed a final report ignoring the complainant’s communication to drop further action.

P T Muthuvel was the panchayat president of a village in Theni district in 2012 when a sum of Rs 2,59,127 was found to be short while auditing the panchayat’s accounts. The block development officer (BDO) of Theni panchayat union initiated proceedings against him by lodging a complaint with the Theni district crime branch police. Muthuvel submitted that he had not committed any misappropriation and the shortfall had occurred due to other reasons. He later remitted the amount which was found to be short. Subsequently, the district collector passed an order dated February 25, 2014 dropping further action against the petitioner. Based on the order, the BDO, who is the complainant, sent a communication dated September 21, 2015 to the inspector of police of district crime branch to drop further action against the petitioner. The BDO also sent a reminder on November 5, 2011.

Ignoring the BDO’s communication, the inspector proceeded with the case and filed the final report before the Theni judicial magistrate on November 7, 2015 which was also taken on file by the court. Hence the petitioner moved the high court Madurai bench in 2016 seeking to quash the trial court proceedings. Hearing the plea, Justice G R Swaminathan observed that the BDO in his counter affidavit had reiterated his earlier stand that the proceedings need not be continued.

MADURAI: Madras high court has cancelled the anticipatory bail granted by the Tirunelveli sessions court to an employee of a publisher who allegedly passed on confidential documents to a rival publisher, saying the court did not apply relevant parameters of law while taking the decision. Justice G R Swaminathan passed the order while hearing the plea moved by the inspector of police of Tirunelveli city crime branch (CCB) seeking to cancel the bail granted to Daniel Sundar. The CCB police had registered a case against Daniel based on a complaint of the managing director of a private publication company. The rival publisher is the second accused in the case registered on January 20 under sections of IPC and Information Technology Act.

According to the FIR, the complainant has been publishing books and guides for students for the past 12 years. He has relevant materials to show that Daniel who was working as a CTP machine operator had joined hands with the rival publisher and passed on several sensitive information causing serious loss to him in the market. The judge observed that Daniel had given a handwritten letter to his employer saying the rival publisher used to contact him and ask for useful market information. Daniel had also admitted that he used to pass on the information through pen drive. The judge noted that the complainant appears to have furnished all such material to the investigation officer due to which interrogation of the accused was necessary. A serious allegation of breach of trust has been made against Daniel who oversaw the process of conversion of soft copy to print. Hence, judge said the sessions court should not have granted anticipatory bail without mentioning any reasons. “In this case, the sessions court chose to go by the submission of the prosecution that Daniel did not have any other case pending against him. This is an utterly irrelevant consideration for grant of anticipatory bail. Instead of applying the relevant parameters of law, the sessions court has chosen to misdirect itself in law and granted relief to Daniel,” observed the judge.

Bareilly: The revenue department has categorically termed all constructions at Delapir pond site here as “unauthorized”. The department was responding to an application by a city-based NGO sent to the district administration regarding rampant encroachments at the pond site. The department said the site was registered as a “pond” in revenue records in 1914 and any construction there is illegal.

Spread across 1.965 hectares, the Delapir pond has been encroached upon by colonisers, land mafia and shopkeepers.

Pradeep Kumar, secretary of a city-based NGO, Jagar Jan Kalyaan, said, “We had submitted a memorandum to the district administration in January in connection with encroachments on Delapir pond and an application was also sent to the revenue department. The department has entered a response in the matter and stated that the area measuring around 1.965 hectares in Biharman Nagla is recorded as a ‘pond’ as per revenue records of 1914. The department, therefore, termed the constructions (encroachments) on the pond area as illegal.”

Kumar added, “The district administration and government departments that were made party into the complaint have taken cognizance of the matter and assured action in the case.”

The NGO had submitted a memorandum to district magistrate Nitin Kumar, seeking action in connection with the encroachment on Delapir pond.

Bareilly SDM Ishan Pratap Singh said, “We have taken cognizance in the case and relevant action will be taken up soon.”

In a similar case relating to an encroachment on what was a pond in Agra, the high court had ordered in September 2019, that the site was recorded as a “pond” in revenue records before 1951 and that it should be brought into its original shape. Any kind of encroachment there should be removed.

The HC order further said, “All collectors of each district in the state shall entrust the additional district magistrate (finance and revenue) concerned to make a list of ponds in existing revenue records in the year 1951-52. He shall also prepare a list of ponds which are under encroachment, or in respect of which, lease has been granted. The collectors shall proceed to cancel the lease of these ponds and restore them in accordance with law and directions issued.”

Pilibhit: Two constables, Devesh Kumar and Ankit Kumar, who were posted at Kamalle crossing police post of Pilibhit Sadar Kotwali police station, were suspended on Sunday for failing to gather prior information about a protest against the Citizen Amendment Act (CAA) in their respective city circle.

A group of residents had staged a protest against the CAA in Sher Mohammad locality on Thursday. However, neither of the constables had any information about the protest and, therefore, could not inform their superiors. On Friday, six of the protesters were arrested while an FIR was lodged against 33 named and 90 to 100 unidentified protesters.

Abhishek Dixit, superintendent of police, suspended the constables on Sunday. He also called for an explanation from the LIU inspector and SHO of the police station concerned.

Praveen Malik, circle officer of Pilibhit city circle, told TOI that a pilot model of beat system had been launched in UP in January under which the circle of Pilibhit sadar Kotwali had been selected. Under this system, dedicated constables had been assigned duty to constantly visit their assigned beat areas and collect all information about crime and criminal activities in addition to reviewing circumstances which could disrupt peace and tranquility.

“The two constables in question produced zero performance in gathering information about the protesters and their plan. So, they have been suspended. The SHO of Pilibhit Kotwali police station, Shrikant Dwivedi, and LIU inspector, Kanchan Singh Rawat, have been directed to file their respective explanations within a fortnight,” SP Dixit said.

The plantation event was attended by child environmental activist Licypriya Kangujam and Klas Molin.

DEHRADUN: In a major fruit tree plantation drive aimed to give a boost to incomes of villagers, over 30,000 saplings were planted in ten different villages of Saklana range of Tehri Garhwal on Sunday. Saklana range is the home turf of Vishweshwar Dutt Saklani, fondly referred to as Uttarakhand’s ‘tree man’ , who had planted several trees and developed a forest in the region. The ceremonial plantation which had the ambassador of Sweden to India, Klas Molin, in attendance, was undertaken in the Government Higher Secondary School of Manjgaon in Saklana range.

According to Raj Mohan, director of Sustainable Green Initiative (SGI), the organisation which conducted the plantation drive, the region was picked “in view of the nature of locals who nurture the saplings like their own babies.” “This is the land of ‘ Tree Man ’ Vishweshwar Dutt Saklani and therefore it is no surprise that people take care of saplings here like their own children,” Raj Mohan said.

Saklani who had developed a forest in what was once barren land, had passed away on January 19, 2019 at the age of 96 years. Mohan said that the afforestation drive was a tribute to Saklani’s vision and his organisation will help the villagers in planting and nurturing these fruit trees. “In February last year as well, we had planted 15,000 fruit trees in the villages here, and the event was dedicated to Saklaniji. This year’s drive is also intended to not only increase the green cover in the area but also provide villagers here with a secondary source of income. According to our estimates, each fruit tree gives a quintal or more of fruits from its fourth year onwards. Even at a marginal market price of Rs 10 per kg, each tree will provide an additional income of Rs 1,000 to the farmer.”

The saplings were planted in the villages of Kalavan, Uniyalgaon, Haveli, Jaadgaon, Navagaon, Semvalgaon, Maroda, Lamkandai, and Hatwalgaon. The saplings included apricot, walnut, plum, pear, papaya, and lemon.

Karuna Singh of the Earth Day Network which was also associated with the initiative, added that besides helping farmers in nurturing saplings into trees, they would be encouraged to avoid use of chemical fertilizers or pesticides. The plantation event was also attended by child environmental activist Licypriya Kangujam, 9, who has been campaigning for action to tackle climate change in the country.

Representative image

MADURAI: Madras high court has restrained the central and state governments from deporting a Sri Lankan woman living in Sivaganga back to her country till a decision is taken by the authorities on her citizenship application submitted in 2018.

Justice S S Sundar passed the order while hearing two petitions filed by Veeran Manonmani in 2018. She had sought a direction to the central government to consider her citizenship application under section 5 (1)(c) of the Citizenship Act, 1955. Subsequently she had filed another petition seeking a direction not to deport her or take any adverse action till the disposal of the application.

Manonmani had got married to Kurumbiah Karuppiah, an Indian citizen, in 2003 and her marriage was registered by the registrar of marriage at Thirupathur in Sivaganga district. She has been living with her husband at her matrimonial home all these years. The petitioner registered herself with the foreigners registration officer-cum-superintendent of police at Sivaganga and her visa was extended periodically by the officer.

The petitioner applied for citizenship through the online portal maintained by the joint secretary of foreigners division of the home ministry on June 7, 2018. Since the application was kept pending and stay visa was to expire on October 11, 2018, she apprehended that the authorities might deport her without disposing of her application for citizenship. The counsel appearing for the ministry submitted that the petitioner’s application is under consideration subject to several regulations and in accordance with law. However, he further submitted that the petitioner’s application has not been forwarded with the collector’s recommendations.

On perusal of the submissions, the judge directed the collector to forward Manonmani’s application to the ministry along with the recommendations within two months. He further directed the ministry to dispose of the petitioner’s online application on merit and in accordance with law within four months thereafter. The judge restrained the authorities from deporting or taking coercive steps against the petitioner under the Foreigners Act till the disposal of the citizenship application. The court also recorded the statement of the additional government pleader giving the assurance.

“It is unfortunate that so far no compensation is paid to the victims by the state government. There were proposals for compensation to the tune of Rs 2.3 crore to 101 people. We will help them through our party and government,” he said. Reddy told the victims he will talk to the state government for compensation, and said state unit of BJP will donate Rs 15 lakh.

92,['17/02/2020'],Madurai: Gold worth Rs 1.49 crore seized from Sri Lankan fishermen,"This story is from February 17, 2020

MADURAI: In a joint operation by the Indian navy, marine police and customs department, three Sri Lankan fishermen were caught off Arichal Munai near Dhanushkodi on Saturday with 3.5kg gold worth nearly Rs 1.49 crore, which was unearthed from their boat on Sunday. Four Indian fishermen who were supposed to receive the gold were also handed over to the customs department.

As the men tried to cross into Sri Lankan waters, Navy chopper INS Parundu forced them to Arichal Munai beach near Dhanushkodi. The men were identified as Anthony Suganth, 26, Santhiya Thomas Luvis, 32, and Thavasin Dominic Sahaya Vinistro, 24, from Talaimannar in Mannar district in Sri Lanka. “They said they handed over the gold to four Rameswaram fishermen who came in a particular mechanised boat in mid sea. The Lankan nationals said they were returning to their country when they were caught,” marine police inspector S Kanagaraj told TOI, adding they had difficulty in confirming it as the boat they mentioned had gone to the sea for fishing.

On Sunday, a boat (IND TN 10 MM 356) that reached Pavalam boat yard near Rameswaram Jetty was searched by police, but no gold was found. “We realised we were misguided by the Lankan men. We searched their boat and found 3.5kg gold,” the inspector said.

The Panama flagged vessel - RU YI I

MADURAI: The Panama flagged vessel - RU YI I - that called on ports in China, before it berthed at V O Chidambaranar Port in Tuticorin on February 14, left the port on Sunday. Dispelling rumours of negligence by port officials in handling the ship in the wake of the novel coronavirus (nCoV) scare, port officials said that the ship had completed unloading cargo before sailing to Mumbai.

The vessel had earlier called on four ports in China – Hong Kong (January 13), Xiamen (January 15), Shanghai (January 19) and Taicang (January 28) – before it berthed at Singapore on February 7. The 19 crew members on board included 15 Chinese nationals and four from Myanmar. Rumours of officials allowing them to disembark were doing rounds.

A senior port official said that agents of a ship will share information on various details including the number of crew on board, their nationality and recent ports called on by the vessel when it comes to the port side. “Harboured at the port outer area at 1pm on February 13, it was subjected to tests as per standard operating procedures for ships that had called on China recently nCoV,” the official told said.

Port health officer P Poornima boarded RU YI I and personally conducted necessary tests for the crew and gave the clearance before the ship was allowed to berth at the port on February 14. If there is a slightest symptom of nCoV for anyone on board, the ship will be rejected and not allowed to enter the port. “Even then landing permit is denied to Chinese nationals and foreign nationals who had been to China on the ship,” he said.

Under these circumstances the vessel started unloading 35 windmill towers, blades and accessories on February 15. Of the “1,838 tonnes cargo to be discharged in Tuticorin, 583 tonnes was discharged on the first day and the remaining 1,255 tonnes in the next two days before RU YI I started from the port around 6 am on Sunday,” the official added.

96,['17/02/2020'],"People must refuse to give info for NPR, says Yechury","This story is from February 17, 2020

Madurai: People should refuse to give details for National Population Register when the exercise starts on April 1 since it is the base for implementation of National Registry of Citizens (NRC), said general secretary of Community Party of India (Marxist) Sitaram Yechury. He was addressing a public meeting organized by the Madurai unit of CPM at Palanganatham on Sunday.

Yechury said that CPM will conduct a door-to-door campaign between March 1 and 23 explaining the ‘perilous’ nature of NRC and how it will affect minorities, marginalized people and poor. He appealed to the people of Tamil Nadu not to participate in NPR and show any document while implementing NRC. He urged all 13 chief ministers, who have announced that they will not implement CAA, not to allow NPR also. However, people can take part in census exercise. “The Kerala chief minister has announced they will not implement NPR. Other chief ministers who stated that they will not implement CAA should not allow NPR. Let Modi and Shah declare more than half of Indians as non-Indians,” he said.

“Modi is planning to welcome Donald Trump. CPM will protest wherever Trumps lands to protest against US imperialism, the way they are dealing with the world and looting India,” he said. CAA links the issue of citizenship with the religion of the person concerned. “Today it may be Muslims, tomorrow it can target Christians, dalits within Hindus and adivasis. Once you bring in discrimination on the basis of any particular criteria, then citizenship is not universal. That is against the fundamental tenets of our Constitution,” he said.

In the last seven months since he returned to power Modi has created unprecedented all-round crisis in the country. Economic crisis has affected livelihood of every single Indian. The government continues to provide tax concessions to rich and corporates. Instead, the money should have been used for rural infrastructure to create more jobs to boost the purchasing power, he said.

Anti-CAA protests are brutally nipped with the help of police in BJP-ruled states like Uttar Pradesh and Assam, where 21 people and 5 people were killed respectively. Even their allies are using brutal force. In Tamil Nadu, people have seen a couple of days ago how police used brutal force against peaceful protest. “They want to curb all peaceful protests through the use of most brutal police terror and police attacks. But people are not succumbing to the police brutality,” he said. Yechury also visited the protesters at Mahaboobpalayam, where a large number of Muslims have been protesting since Saturday morning after the police lathicharge in Chennai.

Hyderabad: City-based pharma behemoth Dr Reddy’s Laboratories on Sunday informed the bourses that the United States Food and Drug Administration (USFDA) has asked the company to initiate voluntary action at its Duvvada formulations facility.

“With regard to the audit of our formulations manufacturing plant (Vizag SEZ Plant 1 - FTO 7) at Duvvada, Visakhapatnam, we would like to inform you that we have been notified by the US FDA, that the inspection classification of the above-referred facility is determined as Voluntary Action Initiated (VAI),” the company informed the bourses on Sunday.

A VAI inspection classification indicates that, although investigators found and documented objectionable conditions during the inspection, FDA will not take or recommend regulatory or enforcement action because the objectionable conditions do not meet the threshold for action at this time.

In August 2019, Dr Reddy’s Laboratories had said that US FDA had issued a Form 483 with eight observations after completion of inspection at this unit. TNN

Madurai: “Is the life of an American more precious than an Indian’s? If the US can do it, why can’t India ,” asked an anguished Anbalagan, crew member of the cruise vessel Diamond Princess currently quarantined off Yokohama, Japan because of coronavirus-hit passengers. He was referring to the efforts taken by the US to lift its citizens from the ship whereas the nearly 160 Indians are left to languish on board along with others.

“We are in the danger zone and the problem is getting bigger with every passing moment. Wake up India,” said Anbalagan in a WhatsApp call with TOI late on Sunday night. A native of Madurai, Anbalagan said the US crew left the ship on Sunday and will be flying home on Monday. “Canadians too are preparing to leave. What about incredible India? From the beginning we have been pleading that the Indian crew should be sent back to India. Is Japan afraid of America and showing lethargy towards India?” he asked

He said the reply given by Union minister for health and family welfare Harsh Vardhan is disturbing for the crew. “We are in a depressing condition for more than two weeks. We made representations to the Government of India and applied pressure through the media but the minister has said there is nothing they can do but wait for Japan to act,” he said. “The minister said that Indians alone cannot be brought out. But, hats off to US president (Donald) Trump as he not only announced that he will take his crew from the ship but also did it,” he said.

Stating that the Indians are losing their morale due to the delay in rescuing them, he however expressed hope that he will soon be able to return home safely. The crew on board the vessel say that the virus had spread from a Japanese tourist. They added that the situation could have been handled better had the crew been allowed to disembark and quarantined separately. Since the Japanese government was acting slowly, they expressed fears that their quarantine could be extended well beyond February 19.

HYDERABAD: Following the concerns home guards over non-payment of their salaries for the past three months, officials of Regional Transport Authority ( RTA ) took stock of the matter, and paid all the pending salaries on Friday.

On February 7, TOI had reported on the issues being faced by home guards, who were awaiting their salaries for the past three months.

Officials who reviewed the matter after the report was published, released the salaries of the home guards without further delay.

“This issue of home guards not being paid their salaries on time is a recurring problem in the RTA department. With no salary from the past three months, most of the guards were in debt and many who were unable to pay rent due to shortage of funds have been asked to vacate their houses by landlords,” said M Dayanand, general secretary, Telangana Auto and Motor Welfare Union.

“We are happy that after the TOI report, the joint transport commissioner took up the issue and made sure that the employees received their salaries,” he said.

Each home guard is paid 20,000 per month, and there are 100 home guards employed with the RTA in Hyderabad and Rangareddy districts. While the home guards of Rangareddy have been getting their salaries on time, the ones employed with Hyderabad RTA had to wait for more than three months to receive their dues.

“There was some problem in the salary payment process, but it has been cleared now. All the salaries that were pending have been cleared,” said C Ramesh, RTA joint transport commissioner.

MADURAI: Nails weighing around one kg hammered into trees were removed from 50 roadside trees in Anna Nagar in Madurai city by volunteers of Vaigai Nathi Makkal Iyakkam. A large number of advertisement boards, mainly of hospitals in the locality, were also removed.

Eight streets were covered by 25 people from the organization starting from Anna Nagar West Main Road to Section Bus Stop in Anna Nagar. The members had brought their children too to help them. Chief coordinator of Vaigai Nathi Makkal Iyakkam, M Rajan said that they had prepared a paste using neem oil and turmeric to apply on the damaged parts of the trees after removing nails to help them heal quickly. There were nails hit years before and recent ones. It cripples the growth of the trees, he said.

M Manikandan, treasurer of the organization said that the city’s green cover is already abysmally low, and if we allow people to hit nails even the existing trees could not be saved. While people are planting saplings to increase green cover, it is also equally important to take care of the existing ones, he said.

He said that they removed around 300 nails, weighing close to one kg. While they removed nails, simultaneously they sensitized people on the ill effects of hitting nails on trees. “We visited houses and asked people to take care of the trees near them. And it is their responsibility to protect the trees off nails,” he said.

Ludhiana: The police booked seven persons for attempt to murder on Saturday evening, a day after they attacked three youths, one of them grievously, with sharp-edged weapons in Raikot.

While two accused have been identified as Sukha of Valmiki Mohalla and Raji of Gondwal, the five others are yet to be identified.

Manjinder Singh, a resident of Qila Raikot, said in his police complaint, “Around 9.30pm on Friday, the seven miscreants surrounded me, my cousin Gagandeep Singh and friend Billa when we were near Kutba Gate in Raikot. They were on motorcycles and attacked us with sharp-edged weapons. I somehow managed to flee from there and hid in a nearby gurdwara. From there, I saw the miscreants brutally assaulting Gagandeep and Billa. When Gagandeep fell on the road, I raised the alarm. Presuming he had died, the assailants fled from there.”

Manjinder took a critically injured Gagandeep to a nearby hospital, from where he was referred to Ludhiana civil hospital. “Civil hospital doctors further referred him to PGI, Chandigarh, after his condition deteriorated,” said a cop.

After recording the statement of Gagandeep, police booked the accused under sections 307 (attempt to murder), 323 (voluntarily causing hurt), 148 (rioting, armed with deadly weapon), 149 (unlawful assembly) of the IPC.

Sub-inspector Gurtar Singh said, “Raids are being conducted to arrest the accused. The condition of Gagandeep is stated to be stable. The attack was the fallout of an old enmity.”

MADURAI: In a fun-filled event in the city on Sunday, visually-challenged people navigated cars using Braille maps for drivers who could see normally. About 50 cars took part in the rally at which visually-challenged people across age groups became navigators.

The sixth edition of Insight Car Rally 2020, organized by Madurai Ladies Circle 8 (MLC 8) and Indian Association for the Blind, Madurai (IAB) saw the public enthusiastically interact with the visually-challenged. “Every year, the visually-challenged at IAB have started waiting expectantly for this rally since it gives them a feeling of empowerment. Navigating using Braille by working together with others is a unique experience for them,” said Sukanya R, president, Madurai Ladies Circle 8.

ARC group of companies director M Raghu Ram and Ladies Circle India national president Nidhi Gupta flagged off the rally which began and ended at Fortune Pandian Hotel. All the participants were given different routes to follow and even names of landmarks as clues, making it more fun for the visually-challenged to figure out. “It was a fun family event and we enjoyed the company of our navigator,” said Rathnakumar C, a participant.

IAB co-ordinator Tamilselvi S said the event helps the visually-challenged feel inspired. “Rarely do they get the chance to leave our campus and get exposed to the company of so many people. It is very refreshing for them. More than a competition, it is an event to enjoy and learn something challenging,” she said. One of the visually-challenged participants, Ramesh G, said that support from the drivers and their family made them feel at home with them. tnn

AIMIM MP Asaduddin Owaisi (File Photo)

HYDERABAD: AIMIM chief Asaduddin Owaisi alleged that BJP , Congress and Aam Aadmi Party ( AAP ) are appeasing Hindus just to win elections.

Addressing an anti-CAA protest in Karnataka , Owaisi said: “Firqa Parasti (fascism) in the country has increased to such an extent that if an election has to be won, let it be Congress or AAP or BJP, they try to prove who is the bigger Hindu. While BJP takes Ram’s name, AAP takes Hanuman’s name and a Congress leader claims he is Shiv bhakt.”

Criticising Congress leader Rahul Gandhi without naming him, Owaisi said, “The Congress leader will become 50 years old soon, but he is still youth. If he is youth, I am forever young. Only my beard is white, but my heart is young. This Congress leader claims himself to be a Shiv bhakt.”

The Hyderabad MP recalled Godhra massacre case. He said that people who killed innocents have been granted bail, and an innocent school principal has been jailed on sedition charges. Owaisi was referring to the bail granted to convicts in Sardarpur riot case of 2002 (post-Godhra), and a school principal in Bidar being booked under sedition charges in January after students staged a anti-CAA play at the school.

109,['17/02/2020'],Get a pair of earplugs as city beats metros in noise pollution,"This story is from February 17, 2020

Ludhiana: The city reported more noise pollution cases than many metropolitan cities, including Delhi, Mumbai, Bengaluru, and Chennai, in 2018.

According to the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) data, Ludhiana commissionerate of police (CP) had the second highest number of cases (8) in the state under ‘Noise Pollution Acts’. No such case was registered in many metropolitan cities like Delhi, Bengaluru, Chennai, Kolkata, Mumbai, Ahmedabad, Hyderabad, Kanpur, Kochi and Patna. Among the metropolitan cities, the highest number of such cases (801) was registered in Jaipur, whereas Pune registered nine cases and Indore three in 2018. In Punjab, Sangrur recorded highest number of cases (10) and Patiala and Mohali had two each.

The NCRB data indicates the number of such cases has witnessed a steep rise here in the past few years. The Ludhiana CP saw two cases in 2017, when Patiala had two cases and Sangrur and Mohali four and five, respectively.

The environmentalists call the number the tip of the iceberg. “The figure is of the cases that were lodged. We believe the problem is much worse and the data doesn’t show severity of noise pollution. The department concerned should act tough against those playing loud music,” said Amandeep Singh, an environment activist.

Dubious distinction

The number of cases of noise pollution for Ludhiana CP comprises 34.7% of the total cases for Punjab (23).

Past action

June 9, 2018: Division 8 police arrested a person for advertising on a public address system at Ghumar Mandi. The accused was identified as Rajwant Singh of Housing Board Colony in BRS Nagar

‘More cases means strictness’

The Punjab Pollution Control Board (PPCB) officials said more number of cases indicates their strictness. PPCB officer Sandeep Behl said the data indicates that they have acted tough against violators and Ludhiana being an industrial city, the number of cases of noise pollution were higher here. He said for Industrial Area, the daytime limit was 75 decibels and for night 70 decibels, whereas limits for commercial areas for day and night time were 65 decibels and 55 decibels, respectively. He said for residential areas, the limit was 55 for daytime and 45 decibels for night. “If the noise level exceeds 10 decibels, we take action, but if its less than that, we issue advisories,” the officer added.

Noisy spots

PPCB officials said areas where noise levels were higher included sections near bus stand, Bharat Nagar Chowk, Bhai Bala Chowk and near railway station. They said high noise levels were detrimental to health and could lead to high blood pressure, headaches, sleep-related problems and damage to eardrums

111,['17/02/2020'],HC asks RBI to “consider” steps against BoB,"This story is from February 17, 2020

Kolkata: The Calcutta high court in a February 10 order has asked Reserve Bank of India ( RBI ) to “consider” taking “appropriate steps” against Bank of Baroda , “including revoking its licence or the authority to carry on banking business, if necessary”.

The six-page order by a division bench of justices Sanjib Banerjee and Kausik Chanda was made on a petition by Indian Oil Corporation (IOCL), which claimed that BoB had failed to honour an unconditional bank guarantee.

According to the order, IOCL had entered into an agreement with one Simplex Projects in 2017 for undertaking certain work at the Bongaigaon facility of IOCL. As per the agreement, IOCL was obliged to make a mobilisation advance against a bank guarantee. In addition, Simplex was also required to furnish a bank guarantee as security deposit. Simplex had given a bank guarantee of Rs 6.97 crore.

IOCL said with no work done it decided to “invoke the bank guarantee”.

IOCL alleged in its petition that though BoB had “no right to stall immediate payment upon the invocation of an unconditional bank guarantee, the bank in this case sought some time”.

IOCL claims that the bank denied it payment prompting it to move the HC to seek a direction on the BoB to honour the unconditional bank guarantee.

The order says, “IOCL maintains that in such circumstances and considering the conduct of the Bank of Baroda, an appropriate order ought to have been passed to revoke its licence since it had acted in a manner unbecoming of a bank, a nationalised bank at that.”

The HC in its order said, “Considering the conduct of the appellants, the Reserve Bank of India should consider what appropriate steps may be taken against the Bank of Baroda, including revoking its licence or the authority to carry on banking business, if necessary.”

Ludhiana: The Ludhiana Police and the district administration have swung into action a day after four children were burnt alive as their school van caught fire in Sangrur. From Monday, 125 police teams will start a drive to ensure all school vehicles are complying with Safe School Vahan Policy.

Commissioner of police Rakesh Agarwal said, “As many as 125 teams will be on the job outside schools in the morning hours. Each SHO will make at least two checking teams, each police post in-charge will make one and the traffic wing 20. Each team will check four to five schools daily. ADCPs and ACPs will monitor the drive under the supervision of DCP (traffic) Sukhpal Singh Brar.”

The teams will check the vehicles outside schools after they drop children.

Ludhiana Regional Transport Authority secretary Damanjit Singh Mann said, “The RTA and the traffic police challaned over 100 school vehicles in the past four months for failing to abide by Safe School Vahan Policy. Some were even impounded. Most of the times, vehicles owned by schools are found to be safe but those hired by parents are lacking on several parameters.”

The RTA has asked the district education office to write to all the schools principals to report to it as well as police about vehicles hired by parents, too. “The principals will inform us if any vehicle is not complying with the norms. This will help us keep a tab on every school, even the small ones in residential areas. In areas like Khanna, Jagraon and Raikot, SDMs will conduct the drives by forming teams with RTA and traffic cops,” he added.

Deputy commissioner Pradeep Kumar Agrawal said, “The campaign will be launched on a war footing and strict action will be taken against defaulters. The road transport authority as well as SDMs have been instructed to monitor it. The district child protection officer should conduct parallel surprise checks in schools.”

Assistant transport officer Kesarpal Singh Dhanoa said, “We have formed two teams to conduct checks Monday onwards. We will take the help of traffic police as well, as we are short staffed. The erring vehicles will be challaned and impounded. But we are yet to decide where to keep the impounded vehicles as neither we nor police stations and Police Lines have enough space to keep them.”

“It is the responsibility of parents too to hire safe vehicles for their wards,” said Schools’ Welfare Association general secretary Gurvinder Singh Rimpi.

RTI activist Ajay Sharma, who have filed petitions against nine schools for failing to provide safe transport, said, “Some of the schools are habitual offenders. A large number of vans are in a bad shape. Many operators turn old vehicles into school vans, squeeze in extra seats and run overloaded. Usually, they do not have CCTVs. And if they do, those are non-functional.”

In 2013-14, then district transport officer Anil Garg had started an intensified drive to conduct regular checks on schools vehicles. Several camps were organised on school premises to issue permits to drivers. However, after that no strict campaigns were conducted to enforce Safe School Vahan Policy.

Gurcharan Singh, secretary, Punjab School Buses Welfare Association, said, “We support the administration. They can organise a camp and check fitness of vehicles. We are also conducting a meeting after the Sangrur incident. We will also meet the local administration to ensure safety of children.”

Fire and rescue personnel from Eloor rushed to the spot and doused the fire before it could spread further.Three hours later, another fire broke out on the west side of the south approach road of railway overbridge, Edappally . In both the cases, the fire spread from a heap of burning waste and spread faster through dried grass and bushes before the officers could douse it. With the atmospheric heat rising much earlier than the advent of summer, Ernakulam district witnessed numerous cases of fire incidents giving the fire and rescue officials a tough time.Around 516 fire cases were reported in the 18 fire stations in the district from January to February 16 this year, out of which, more than 75% were ground fires. Officials said most of these ground fires were manmade due to careless burning of garbage bundles or dry grass. With the number of cases about to rise in the coming weeks, officials advised people to restrain from burning garbage as these could turn into major fires easily.“More than 75% of the fire calls received by the stations were about ground fires. There is a high probability of fire breakouts due to rise in temperature and we are prepared for that. But manmade fires can be avoided if people are careful, and the best way is to avoid burning garbage bags. If people set fire to heaps of waste and move away carelessly, fire can easily spread to surroundings as the winds and atmospheric temperature will fuel it up. Even if people burn dry grass in their surroundings, they should douse it off completely before they leave and make fire lines” said Gandhinagar fire station officer Unnikrishnan A.The only major fire breakout in the district since January was the one at the rubber scrap processing factory at Pallikkara.

117,['17/02/2020'],"After Bihar, Nitish Kumar pushes for nationwide ban on alcohol","This story is from February 17, 2020

CM Nitish Kumar

PATNA: Chief minister (CM) Nitish Kumar on Sunday pitched for a nationwide ban on liquor, saying it is necessary from social, religious and scientific points of view. He said there was no adverse impact on the Bihar government’s revenue after the enforcement of total prohibition in the state.

Addressing a national convention on ‘Liquor-free India’ at Iskcon Auditorium in Delhi, Nitish said Bihar emerged as role model for other states by enforcing total prohibition.

“Official delegations from many states visit Bihar to study its prohibition policy. Separate teams of the excise department and other institutions from Karnataka came to Bihar in 2017, from Chhatisgarh in 2018 and from Rajasthan in December 2019. These study teams visited different parts of Bihar and closely monitored implementation of liquor ban at the grassroots level. They appreciated the Bihar government for ensuring effective liquor ban. It led to demands for liquor ban in different parts of the country,” Nitish said.

The national convention, organised by the Milita Odisha Nisha Nibaran Abhiyan (MONNA), was attended by anti-liquor campaigners and social activists from different states.

Nitish said since voices for putting a Bihar-like ban on liquor were raised in different parts of the country, big liquor traders are afraid. “Taking a cue from Bihar, people have started raising demand for ban on liquor in different states,” he said.

The Bihar government had imposed complete ban on sale, manufacture and consumption of liquor in April 2016.

“In Bihar, we are committed to ensuring the policy of development with justice. We are not going to compromise on this policy at any cost. I strongly feel that unless the society is made free of the social evils like liquor, dowry and child marriage, the poor will not get the benefits of development,” Nitish said.

The CM cited the latest findings of the World Health Organization (WHO) to support his government’s move to enforce total prohibition in the state.

Quoting the WHO’s global status report on alcohol and health, published in 2018, Nitish said around 30 lakh people died because of harmful use of liquor globally in 2016. It was 5.3% of all deaths in the world that year.

He also pointed out that liquor consumption causes death and disability relatively early in life. “In the age group 20–39 years, 13.5% of the total deaths in the world were alcohol-related,” he said quoting the WHO report.

Rajya Sabha deputy chairperson and JD(U) member Harivansh, well-known Gandhian and social activist Radha Bhatt and MONNA president and former Odisha legislator Padam Charan Nayak also addressed the convention. All the speakers lauded Bihar CM for enforcing total prohibition in the state.

NEW DELHI: Over 50,000 people thronged Ramlila Maidan on Sunday to usher in AAP 3.0. It was a loud mix of colour and music and the atmosphere was electric through the day. Sporting traditional AAP caps and waving the tricolour, people started arriving in droves from 9am onwards. The venue was soon filled to capacity.A large part of the crowd comprised people from unauthorised colonies, the neighbouring Old Delhi areas and rural and urban villages. There were some who made the journey from the neighbouring states too. Teachers, children and party workers were spotted in large numbers.Rohit Gahlot, a resident of Najafgarh, claimed almost 1,000 people had come from Najafgarh alone. Like him, scores of others sported a sky-blue turban. “We are all wearing blue-coloured turbans, which is the symbol of Najafgarh. We are happy with AAP government and we want to show our support,” Gahlot said.SP Sharma, a resident of Bulandshahr in Uttar Pradesh, said this election was fought on work and not religion, paving the way for a new kind of politics. “Kaum pe nahi, kaam pe chunav lada hai,” he said. Sharma, who is unemployed, said he had volunteered to assist AAP functionaries Dilip Pandey and Atishi in their campaigns. “The party allowed me to help with the campaign trail and I am honoured to have helped them win. We want the party to spread out to other states too,” he said.Mamta Yadav, a resident of Burari, was all praise for AAP. She said: “If we start talking about why we like this party, the list will be endless. I don’t think that this city has ever had a CM who is as grounded and approachable as Kejriwal ji. As we could not afford private schools, were forced to send our children to government schools that were in a dilapidated condition.

The venue was filled to capacity much before the ceremony started

NEW DELHI: Over 50,000 people thronged Ramlila Maidan on Sunday to usher in AAP 3.0. It was a loud mix of colour and music and the atmosphere was electric through the day. Sporting traditional AAP caps and waving the tricolour, people started arriving in droves from 9am onwards. The venue was soon filled to capacity.

A large part of the crowd comprised people from unauthorised colonies, the neighbouring Old Delhi areas and rural and urban villages. There were some who made the journey from the neighbouring states too. Teachers, children and party workers were spotted in large numbers.

Rohit Gahlot, a resident of Najafgarh, claimed almost 1,000 people had come from Najafgarh alone. Like him, scores of others sported a sky-blue turban. “We are all wearing blue-coloured turbans, which is the symbol of Najafgarh. We are happy with AAP government and we want to show our support,” Gahlot said.

SP Sharma, a resident of Bulandshahr in Uttar Pradesh, said this election was fought on work and not religion, paving the way for a new kind of politics. “Kaum pe nahi, kaam pe chunav lada hai,” he said. Sharma, who is unemployed, said he had volunteered to assist AAP functionaries Dilip Pandey and Atishi in their campaigns. “The party allowed me to help with the campaign trail and I am honoured to have helped them win. We want the party to spread out to other states too,” he said.

Mamta Yadav, a resident of Burari, was all praise for AAP. She said: “If we start talking about why we like this party, the list will be endless. I don’t think that this city has ever had a CM who is as grounded and approachable as Kejriwal ji. As we could not afford private schools, were forced to send our children to government schools that were in a dilapidated condition. But now Manish Sisodia sir has changed the face of these schools and they are in no way inferior to their private counterparts.” She predicted even bigger things for the party. “If this is how the party keeps functioning, votes of everyone in our family will go to Kejriwal ji,” she said.

Mohammad Bilal from Ranjeet Nagar said the government should focus on providing employment opportunities. “The government paid a lot of attention to schools in its previous tenure. It should now look to create more jobs,” he said.

Kashish Kumar Pandey from Uttam Nagar had come to attend the ceremony with his family of six. He said: “The roads were not so well lit earlier. Though that problem has been sorted out, broken roads are still a problem. But we are confident that this is the only government that will listen to us.”

The contribution of the “common man” found mention in chief minister Arvind Kejriwal’s speech several times.

NEW DELHI: “Ordinary” people with “extraordinary deeds” were in focus at the swearing-in ceremony on Sunday and AAP government honoured the 50 “Dilli ke Nirmatas” by giving them prime seats on the either side of the stage.

The contribution of the “common man” found mention in chief minister Arvind Kejriwal ’s speech several times. The CM said that they were integral to AAP’s success.

There was a clear effort to include people from the different stratas and, as such, the “nirmatas” included bus conductors, doctors, engineers, traders, teachers, farmers and sanitation workers, among others. For most of them, it was an emotional moment.

Lazwanti, a safai karamchari, said while people generally ignored the hard work she put in daily, all eyes were on her when she reached the stage on Sunday. “It’s an honour for your work to be appreciated. I could not believe that I would share the stage with the chief minister. I will remember this day for the rest of my life,” she said.

Gajraj Singh, a bus conductor, said when he received the invite, he first dismissed it as a joke. But as the news sunk in, he was both elated and honoured. “I believe that every work is important and am very happy that mine is being recognised,” Singh said.

Vijay Kumar Sagar, a construction worker, said he had gone through several ups and downs in life. “I am honoured by the tag of ‘Delhi ke Nirmata’. I hope that he (Kejriwal) continues to remain Delhi’s CM for the next 20 years,” he said.

Among others who found mention in CM’s speech were Dalibir Singh, a farmer who benefited greatly through an increase in the circle rate for agriculture land and the reduction in his power bills; VK Gupta, a civil engineer working on several action plans for Delhi; Nidhi Gupta, a metro pilot who ferries lakhs of Delhiites every day; and Arun Kumar, a bus marshal who recently saved a six-year-old from the clutches of abductors.

Kumar said it was a life-changing incident and if he ever got another chance to help someone, he would do it in a blink.

In the last two years, AIIMS has achieved many milestones. It has started its academic services, outpatient department ( OPD ), day-care services and is set to start its inpatient department by the end of 2020.

Having AIIMS in the city is like a dream come true for many Nagpurians. Citizens are quite eager to know about the functioning of AIIMS, but not many have visited the swanky campus of this institute in MIHAN SEZ.

At present, one can avail the OPD services at AIIMS from 9am to 4.30pm (Mon-Fri) and 9am to 1.30pm on Saturday. The AIIMS building has itself become a landmark in MIHAN as it is one of the very few fully-functioning institutes in this region.

The OPD and AYUSH Complex, Dharamshala (where admitted patients’ relatives will stay), library, lecture halls, laboratories, multi-storied residential quarters and hostels for faculty and students, guesthouse and in-house sports facility — are up and running.

AIIMS Nagpur Director, Maj Gen (Dr) VA Dutta (SM), most of the faculty and all the 150 students live here in their residential facilities.

The construction of the 300-bed in-patient department (IPD), to be equipped with 24 modular OTs, ICUs and imaging facilities such as MRI and CT scan, is in full swing and is likely to be ready by the end of 2020.

With 150 students, proficient faculty (93) picked through the national selection process, AIIMS is all set to serve patients in Nagpur.

AIIMS Nagpur has also conducted numerous out-reach programmes, drives and camps.

“We have adopted three schools and one urban PHC (UPHC) in Nandanwan. From the time we started providing services at this OPD, the patient count has increased to 2451 from the 500-odd in the first year of its adoption. We are also in the process of adopting a rural PHC in Bela,” said the director of AIIMS.

“Speciality clinics in some departments and stress clinics have also been started to cater to the special needs of the vulnerable population of Vidarbha,” she added.

Thiruvananthapuram: The state government has approved ‘ Sahitham ’, the mentoring programme to help students harmonise their social and emotional skills along with academic competencies.

The programme has been devised as directed by chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan during the public education rejuvenation mission’s review meeting. “With the state schools becoming hi-tech, the objective of a school-level master plan is further enhanced to a more academic student-centric individual master plan, which has been realised through ‘Sahitham’,” said general education minister C Raveendranath.

As part of Sahitham programme, the mentor teacher gets to closely observe, study and record online the academic improvement of each student along with their socio-linguistic skills, social awareness, scientific aptitude, etc. In addition, the teacher would be able to plan necessary corrective learning activities by understanding the learning difficulties of students by observing their social background. Teachers would be provided with even psychological types of training as part of this programme.

The Kerala Infrastructure and Technology for Education (KITE) has developed and manages the Sahitham portal with academic support of SCERT. “Sahitham will act as the backbone for the programme and will have facilities for online guidance to even the parents regarding their children’s capabilities, strongholds and areas where further interventions are required by effectively utilizing the scope of artificial intelligence, data analytics, etc.,” said K Anvar Sadath, chief executive officer, KITE.

The basic details of students captured in the Sampoorna school management portal would be made available to the mentor teachers in Sahitham portal. The mentors need to undertake activities to know the background details of individual students through informal talks, house visits, close observation, etc. Arrangements have to be made by director of general education to implement the pilot run of the programme in Class I to VII of selected schools this year and to extend the programme to all schools from next academic year onwards.

Human Resources Development (HRD) minister Ramesh Pokhriyal Nishank

HARIDWAR: Union Human Resources Development (HRD) minister Ramesh Pokhriyal Nishank said in Haridwar on Sunday that he was concerned about anti-social elements trying to tarnish the image of universities like Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) and Jamia Milia Islamia. The minister added that “strict action will be taken against those involved in carrying out anti-social activities in these institutions.”

Nishank made these comments while addressing members of the Haridwar Press Club.

Reacting to a query on the continuing agitation in JNU, the minister said that “JNU has produced great personalities who have made significant contributions in various walks of life but some negative forces are out to damage its reputation and disrupt the university campus.” “The government will deal with such elements with a heavy hand and will not allow them to use our university campuses for anti-national, anti-social or disruptive activities,” Nishank alleged.

When asked on the speculations regarding his name being considered by the saffron party as a possible replacement for CM Trivendra Rawat, Nishank chose to sidestep the issue. “I am a loyal worker of the party and have always done whatever work is assigned to me. That is what I will do in future as well,” he said.

On queries regarding the national education policy, Nishank said that the policy was currently being given finishing touches. “Several innovative measures including use of new technology will characterise the new education policy framed on the basis of over two lakh suggestions received from people from across India and it is most likely to be implemented in about six months’ time,” he said. He added that the government has also decided to “provide help to 20 government and 20 private-sector higher educational institutions for their comprehensive development and to facilitate their growth into global-level institutions of higher learning.”

Mangaluru: Rohit Kharvi ,35, a labourer who was engaged in borewell construction near Maravanthe Breakwater in Kundapur, had a miraculous escape after he was rescued from a 12-foot borewell pit on Sunday.

According to police inspector Suresh Naik, the incident was reported around 10am when attempts were being made to dig the area around the borewell, where a six-inch pipe was already laid.

An old six-inch pipe was already there. In order to change the pipe, they were undertaking soil cutting of 1.5 feet diameter around the area. When they reached a depth of 10-12 feet, the mud slipped all of a sudden, and fell on two labourers. Lakshman Kharvi was rescued immediately, but Rohit Kharvi got trapped, with the debris reaching up to his shoulder. Since the width of the hole was only 1.5 feet, it was difficult for him to move. When he called for help, the people rushed and placed a drum around him, to prevent any more debris from falling on him.

“The rescue operation was a challenge, because the moment rescuers went close, mud would start slipping. He was covered with mud up to his neck and there were chances of him dying of suffocation by drowning in the mud, in case any more mud fell on him,” the inspector said. He was finally rescued and pulled out from the pit with the help of a canvas hose that was tied to a crane.

Rohit was rescued in a four-hour joint operation that was conducted by the personnel of the police, fire and emergency services and locals. MLA B M Sukumar Shetty has announced a cash reward of Rs 25,000 to the rescue team.

Arvind Kejriwal

NEW DELHI: With a much shorter speech by Arvind Kejriwal , higher emphasis on reconciliation with the Centre and a new type of politics for developing Delhi into a world-class city, Sunday’s oath-taking ceremony was a relatively simpler affair compared with 2013 and 2015.

There was no roadshow or a metro trip to reach the venue or a visit to Rajghat by Kejriwal, which had triggered both curiosity as well as chaos in 2013. Kejriwal arrived at Ramlila Maidan in his grey Innova and spoke for a little over 21 minutes on Sunday compared with 55 minutes in 2015.

Wearing a maroon sweater with a white shirt and donning a vermillion tilak on his forehead, Kejriwal started his speech with Bharat Mata ki Jai, Inquilab Zindabad and Vande Mataram, just like last time.

In 2013, Kejriwal had administered an oath to people of not giving or accepting bribes, but no such thing took place this time. Also missing were repeated calls to people to trap corrupt officials demanding bribes by recording them on cellphones.

He remained focused on developing Delhi into the Number 1 city of the world with the help of everyone, including opposition parties, central government and Prime Minister. Kejriwal wasn’t found sporting an AAP cap with “Main Hoon Aam Aadmi” written on it. He also didn’t mention Jan Lokpal Bill.

Drawing the attention of people to the 50 “Dilli ke Nirmata” sitting on the dais, Kejriwal said, “These are the people who run Delhi. Let’s clap for them.”

Instead of singing the Manna Dey song “Insan ka Insan se ho bhaichara, ye paigam hamara”, which he had crooned in both 2013 and 2015, he asked the crowd to accompany him in singing “Hum honge kaamyaab”. The crowd, which largely comprised people from diverse areas residing in unauthorised colonies, slum clusters and the Walled City, serenaded along.

Kejriwal’s cabinet did not have a female minister, unlike 2013 when Rakhi Bidlan was administered oath of office and secrecy.

There was also a wide diversity in the oaths taken by the ministers. In a departure from tradition of invoking God, Gopal Rai took oath in the name of “martyrs of the freedom struggle”. Rajendra Pal Gautam was sworn in in the name of Tathagat Buddha, while Imran Hussain took oath of office in the name of Allah and oath of secrecy in the name of Ishwar.

The poorly maintained road, filled with potholes, poses a threat to two-wheelers and other smaller vehicles.

DEHRADUN: A prominent road stretch in the city which is notorious for its potholes is the one between Survey Chowk and Sahasthradhara crossing. Commuters face a harrowing time on a daily basis while passing through this particular stretch.

That this road is in such a state is a pity since it is used by hundreds of people while going to important defence establishments like the Defence Electronics Applications Laboratory as well as the Ordinance Factory at Raipur, while many people also use it for going to the Jolly Grant Airport.

Pradeep Pathak, a local resident, said, “The Raipur Road between Sahasthradhara crossing and Survey Chowk is full of potholes, especially the point near the bridge is in the worst condition with huge potholes. The administration seems to have turned a blind eye on problems faced by the people here.”

The poorly maintained road, filled with potholes — some of them over half-a-ft-deep — also pose a threat to two-wheelers and other smaller vehicles.

According to residents, the pothole-ridden road has been left neglected since the end of the monsoon season, while the other roads in the city have been partially or completely repaired.

Navneet Rawat, a resident of Tapovan, told TOI, “It is harrowing to pass through this stretch in the morning and afternoon hours due to massive traffic jams, and potholes just add to the woes. I can’t imagine that an important road in a state capital would be in such a bad shape.”

To regulate the vehicular movement, several traffic cops have been deployed at selected locations on the 1km stretch. However, despite that, the traffic condition remains grim ahead of Sahasthradhara crossing.

Civic officials meanwhile continue to play the blame game. When contacted, Jagmohan Chauhan, executive engineer of Public Works Department (PWD), said, “Maintenance work on Raipur Road is pending due to delay in shifting of electricity poles, which has to be done by the power department. The road was repaired by PWD, but was once again dug up by the Jal Nigam for some work.”

134,['17/02/2020'],"Amrut mission flip-flops over project costs, settles down","This story is from February 17, 2020

Thiruvananthapuram: The Amrut mission directorate’s fluctuating stand on project costs for executing four key sewerage works in city nearly landed the Kerala water authority (KWA) and corporation in a soup, forcing the intervention of the water authority’s senior officials.

The state high powered steering committee (SHPSC) meeting held in October 2019 had decided to approve tender excess for four sewerage works and secretary of corporation was directed to obtain the council’s approval for the same.

Mission directorate officials had insisted that all works shall be awarded by December and even placed the responsibility of ensuring awarding of work by December with the secretary of the city corporation and made it a part of her performance appraisal.

These projects are critical to establishing sewer connectivity between Kazhakootam and Muttathara.

Former mayor V K Prasanth and minister Kadakampally Surendran have been keen on realising these projects in the wake of waterbodies getting contaminated owing to inflow of unprocessed sewage.

Following the SHPSC decision, revised administrative sanction was accorded by the corporation council for the projects in November 2019.

KWA which was put under pressure to award works by December issued selection notice to contractors for these works by December 31. However, officials with mission directorate suddenly flipped on their stand in the SHPSC meeting held on February 4.

KWA officials associated with the project were reportedly asked to reconsider awarding of works citing that it might require an assessment by financial inspection wing.

R Girija, mission director, who was present in the meeting held in October in which revised sanction was given to these projects sought clarity on the tender excess, but when KWA asked if they should halt the works, no concrete reply was given.

The vacillating stand of mission directorate apparently prompted by unwillingness to take up responsibility left both corporation and KWA in the lurch.

The matter was then communicated to the KWA brass who soon intervened in the matter and demanded a concrete stand from the part of mission directorate.

R Girija said that she had sought clarity but the project has been now approved. “I asked for clarity and it has been now approved,'' Girija said. However, she didn't elaborate on the need to seek clarity for projects which were earlier approved by the committee of which she is a member.

Sources said the mission directorate was wary of maintaining fiscal discipline and with the mission period getting extended beyond March 2020, officials did not want to take up any kind of liability.

135,['17/02/2020'],Arvind Kejriwal papers over rift with Centre,"This story is from February 17, 2020

Arvind Kejriwal

NEW DELHI: In stark contrast to the first three years of the previous government that was marked by constant run-ins between the Centre and the state government, newly sworn-in chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Sunday sought cooperation of the Centre and hinted at a more conciliatory approach.

After taking the oath of office, Kejriwal stressed on the importance of greater coordination with the Centre and sought the blessings of Prime Minister Narendra Modi for smooth governance in the capital. Kejriwal is expected to retain the water portfolio in the new government and the CM reiterated his promise of 24x7 supply to all households.

The government also wants to keep other promises made in the guarantee card issued by AAP before the elections and this would entail greater focus on public transport, mohalla clinic expansion and further improvement in the education infrastructure, besides cleaning up of Yamuna, improving sanitation and fighting pollution.

Kejriwal was at the receiving end of a bitterly-fought election where he was even called “terrorist” by some senior BJP functionaries. On Sunday, however, the CM said he had forgiven his opponents for the remarks. This marked a new beginning for Kejriwal whose second term as CM had begun on a stormy note: by the end of 2015, his office had been raided by CBI, which had prompted him to call Modi “a psychopath and a coward”.

In the previous term, Delhi government was involved in several clashes with the Centre. After a rout in Lok Sabha election in May 2019, which jolted AAP’s expansion plans nationally, Kejriwal has adopted a more pacifist attitude. Not only did he discontinue his attacks on PM Modi, he harped on the need for better Centre-state ties for the benefit of Delhi people. His relationship with the lieutenant governor, who is appointed by the Centre, also improved significantly towards the end of his second tenure.

Hopes of a calmer AAP 3.0 can be pinned on not only a more experienced Kejriwal and his team, but also a Supreme Court order of 2019 that seemed to settle the issue of sharing of powers. In 2015, the complexities of the administrative structure had rattled Kejriwal and other AAP functionaries. Delhi government was in a constant tussle with the Centre and LG. The Delhi versus Centre battle intensified in 2016 following a Delhi HC order that asked Delhi government to take LG’s approval for all policy matters. In the wake of the HC order, all files had to be routed to LG. This fuelled confrontation as Delhi government accused LG of delaying all its major reforms. The contentious issue was, however, settled after Supreme Court in February 2019 made it clear that the elected government didn’t need the approval of LG for policy decisions.

AAP 2.0 also had its hands full while dealing with the bureaucracy and there were several flashpoints. Things improved towards the end of the previous tenure and, insiders said, this was likely to result in a faster delivery of governance.

The stature of Kejriwal in the party and outside it has grown manifold vis-à-vis 2015. While various party functionaries, such as Kumar Vishwas, Yogendra Yadav and Prashant Bhushan, among others, have parted ways, Kejriwal 3.0 is centred around the CM himself and his trusted lieutenants.

Udaipur: To win the confidence of villagers and make them aware of co-existence with tigers before the big cats are reintroduced in Kumbalgarh sanctuary, experts from the forest department and wildlife activists have launched a series of chaupal in villages falling inside the sanctuary area and its periphery. On Sunday, teams held meetings at Guda Bhop Singh, Mandigarh and Ghanerao in Pali district.

The initiative comes after a series of protests from the locals expressing their dissent over the move of the state government to relocate the tigers. Experts addressed the concerns of the local community and pointed out the numerous benefits they would have after rehabilitation of the wild cats in their area.

The volunteers explained about the compensation given by the government for animal-induced damage on livestock and human beings as well.

The experts also suggested land use planning so that humans and animals have the space they need, creating buffer zones and developing tolerance towards the mute creatures who depend on human beings for their survival.

The forest department had submitted a plan for tiger rehabilitation in one of the old corridors that connects Kumbalgarh to Phulwari and Polo forests of Gujarat. The area of the proposed reserve is 1105.79 sq-km that falls in Kumbalgarh and Todgarh Raoli sanctuaries spread in Rajsamand and Pali districts with 99 natural and 81 artifical waterholes.

There are some 51 villages inside Kumbalgarh and Todgarh Raoli sanctuaries while 206 villages are situated within a periphery of 5 km. Fire incidences are frequent during summers and presence of many pilgrim and historical sites inside like Kumbalgarh fort, Parshuram Mahadeo, Muchhala Mahaveer etc at peripheral zone are cause of concern. Hotels and resorts too are mushrooming in the proximity of the proposed reserve sites. There are many roads inside and peripheral area while there are wells without parapet walls.

Arvind Kejriwal

NEW DELHI: With a landslide victory in Delhi, Aam Aadmi Party’s national ambitions are soaring. Many people who came to attend the swearing-in ceremony of Arvind Kejriwal at Ramlila Maidan on Sunday wished that he run for Prime Ministership.

Among those hoping for Kejriwal to become the PM was 21-year-old Nikhil Bansal from Agra. He and his mother had come to meet Kejriwal wishing that he helps them catch the burglars who looted their house a year ago. “Sometimes we feel bad that we do not live in Delhi. This place is much safer. The AAP government has worked more than the others. We want Kejriwal to represent the country as PM and not just stay limited as the Delhi CM ,” said Bansal.

Savitri Devi from Mayapuri in west Delhi claimed that the freebies given by the AAP government had put more money in the hands of women. “Our husbands used to deduct the electricity and water bills from the money they gave us to spend. Now that these facilities, apart from bus rides, are free, we have more money to fulfil our little desires. If Kejriwal becomes the PM, women across the country will get such privileges,” she added.

Though Kejriwal plans to focus on governance in the capital, AAP is exploring the scope of expanding its footprints beyond Delhi and Punjab. Demands are rising from Bihar for the party to contest the assembly polls. AAP Delhi convener and minister Gopal Rai had stated that the party would be contesting the municipal polls across the country. The party will be focusing on winning most of the wards in the three corporations in Delhi when they go to polls in 2022.

On Sunday, Malviya Nagar AAP MLA Somnath Bharti told a news agency that people were demanding that the party go nationwide and they would not be disappointed.

AAP has active organisations in more than 20 states, but its performance in their assembly polls has been discouraging. However, the party is now in a stronger position. Governments in other states feel that AAP’s free schemes played a crucial role in the party’s return to power.

The protesters wanted to march to Parliament, but were stopped by police at Jantar Mantar.

NEW DELHI: Parts of central Delhi were blocked on Sunday as protesters marched from Mandi House to Jantar Mantar against the Supreme Court ruling that state governments were not bound to provide reservation in promotions in public services.

The protest was led by Bhim Army chief Chandrashekhar Azad , who said that the country will be run based on the Constitution and by the people of the country and not by those sitting in the government and making decisions for them.

The protesters wanted to march to Parliament , but were stopped by police at Jantar Mantar. Azad asked people to come out on the streets on February 23, terming it a massive “Bharat Bandh”. The protest was also backed up by All India Students’ Association.

Around 11am, protesters from Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan and Delhi started gathering near the Mandi House roundabout. The numbers grew by noon and Azad reached there by 1pm.

Azad said, “I have little time as I need to rush to Punjab. I have called for a bandh on February 23 and will fulfil it. The SC/ST community and minorities in Punjab will support us. The court said that reservation in promotions is not a fundamental right, but that is wrong. The decision of nine or seven-bench judges was delivered by two judges.”

Though the march was about reservation, protesters also held banners showing their dissent about CAA/NPR/NRC. Bijendra Sud, a teacher from Meerut, said, “Reservation is not a game that you give once and then take it away. Reservations are made on the basis of the situation. This government is not thinking about the backward classes and the minorities.”

IBrainstorming: Captains of industries of GSB community including Ullas Kamath (second right) share ideas over... Read More

Mangaluru: Konkani entrepreneurship is set for a big boost , courtesy an initiative taken by Kodial Sports Association and Youth of GSB . Taking forward an idea that community leader T V Mohandas Pai had mooted, community leaders from the corporate world on Saturday night pledged to start a venture capital fund that will fund Gowd Saraswath Brahmin youths to start their own ventures, while indemnifying them from failure.

Mooting this idea for GSB entrepreneurs on the sidelines of GPL Utsav 4.0 was Ullas Kamath, joint managing director, Jyothy Labs, and seconding the same was Sudhir Pai, executive director, Bharath Group. The idea was based on the premise that the resourceful GSB community should be job givers and not job seekers, especially in an age when a salaried job is unlikely to fire up many hearths at home.

Ullas was categorical in asserting that they would expect nothing in return from the youths funded through the initiative. “Even if all the youths who are funded fail, it should not be an issue, for it is these very failures that will make the youths resourceful and resolute in learning from it, and becoming better entrepreneurs,” he said. “Ideas of a similar nature should be pooled to ensure optimal utilisation of the funds at disposal,” he said.

Another significant point that he mooted was to create an atmosphere where women in the community no longer remained homemakers but equal partners in driving home entrepreneurship. This will help add 50% to the household GDP, he surmised, while advising existing entrepreneurs not to bring their own children into family enterprises, but allow them to learn the ropes of management outside, so that they learn the needs and aspirations of being an employee.

Sudhir and Raghunandan Kamath of Natural Ice Creams and Pradeep G Pai of Hangyo Ice Creams, who shared their entrepreneurial stories, said they succeeded in trying to do something novel with their time. If this novelty lay in starting a mall and expanding the family beedi business into an automobile dealership for Sudhir, it was fruit-based ice-cream with home knowledge to give people a delicious treat for Kamath, and urge to dabble in dairy from being the dealer of a company for Pradeep.

NAGPUR: Calls were made to persuade Dalits and other minorities to join the anti CAA-NRC agitation, at a protest on Sunday. The main speakers were former Maharashtra cadre IPS officer Abdul Rehman, who has quit his job over CAA-NRC issue , and justice BG Kolse Patil, an ex-judge who is among the leaders of Elgar Parishad.

Addressing a crowd of over 3,000 at the Idgah Grounds in Jaffar Nagar locality on Sunday, a message was put across that awareness must be created that Muslims alone will not be affected by the law. Even Dalits and tribals will be victims of the NRC, said the speakers.

Patil asked the audience — mainly Muslims — to reach out to Dalits in each village, and tell them even they will be at the receiving end due to NRC.

“Tell the Dalits that they will be getting the status of refugees under CAA. First, they will be out under NRC for not having papers, and then included as refugees under CAA and granted citizenship . Now a proud citizen of the country, they will end up being refugees later granted citizenship. New castes will be carved out for such people, further dividing the nation” said Rehman.

He asked the audience to reach out to Dalits, Sikhs, Christians and other minorities to spread the message against CAA-NRC.

Patil came down on the RSS, saying that the organization has been spreading hatred in the country. He claimed to have records in which Sadhvi Pragya Thakur and Lt Colonel Shrikanth Purohit have said their activities were carried out at the behest of the RSS.

“I have Purohit’s confession records in which he said that a sharp shooter was kept ready for even RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat. It was because he believed that the RSS chief took funding from the ISI,” claimed Patil.

Patil went on to say that IB and RAW had entire knowledge about the movements of Pakistani terrorists as they reached India by sea to carry out the 26/11 attacks. The state government was, however, kept in the dark. The bullets that killed state’s anti-terror squad chief Hemant Karkare were of 9mm calibre used by the state police, he claimed.

142,['17/02/2020'],8 lakh books collected for classroom libraries,"This story is from February 17, 2020

Thiruvananthapuram: The district panchayat, which initially set a target of collecting five lakh books for class room libraries in schools in the district, has now amassed over eight lakh books. The project will be officially launched by chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan in the first week of March in a function to be held at Putharikandom.

District panchayat initially aimed to establish over 10,000 classroom libraries in the district by January 2020. Initially, they collected over five lakh books as part of the project. District panchayat president V K Madhu said that although the initial target was collecting five lakh books, the good response prompted them to revise the target to 10 lakh books.

As many as 10,600 classroom libraries will become fully functional in schools in the district. “There is another plan by which public libraries near a school can contribute books to classroom libraries for a period of one month. Once new books arrive, they can take back the old ones and give new stock. Thus our kids would get to read new books every month,” said Madhu.

The library council has also joined the collection drive and had contributed 5,000 books at the collection counter set up in front of district panchayat office in November. The project titled ‘Sargavayana Sampoornavayana’ aims to reach out to 5.58 lakh students in 988 schools in the district.

Chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan had launched the initiative. The book collection drive began on November 1, 2019, with school-level committees organizing door-to-door visits to collect books.

District panchayat allots Rs 1,000 per class room for setting up library. The rest of the amount is mobilized by school PTA. Shelves are also being readied in schools for storing books. The panchayat aims to implement the project in 141 public schools. Each class will receive 100-200 books.

Kallara Vocational Higher Secondary School showed example by collecting over 15,000 books. Many schools launched ‘book vans’, which toured the locale and collected books from households and cultural institutions.

143,['17/02/2020'],March to Amit Shah’s house aborted after cops say no,"This story is from February 17, 2020

NEW DELHI: The protesters at Shaheen Bagh , who had said they would march to Union home minister Amit Shah ’s residence on Sunday and speak to him about CAA-NRC, called off their march after being denied permission by Delhi Police .

The ‘dadis of Shaheen Bagh’ spoke to high-ranking police officials and after assurances, decided to call off their march and “abide by the law”. “The idea to march to the home minister’s residence came after Shah spoke about the protest at an event in the city and said that if anyone wanted to discuss the CAA, they could come and meet him. Hence we, as responsible citizens, decided to go and meet him,” said a protester.

Around 2pm, a crowd began to gather next to the road where the women have been on a sit-in for over two months now. Eventually, they started walking towards Jasola Vihar metro station, but were informed by the organisers that only the dadis of Shaheen Bagh (the old ladies of the area who have become the face of the protests) would go ahead and speak to the police.

“We will speak to the cops and if they don’t allow us to march, we won’t go. We want the home minister to take back this law or come and speak to us,” said Sarwari, one of the dadis.

DCP (southeast) Rajendra Prasad Meena said: “We appealed to the elderly women that there was no permission to carry out a march and instead they could form a delegation.”

One of the organisers, Shaheen Kausar, later told TOI that no further decision has been taken regarding the march to the home minister’s residence.

145,['17/02/2020'],Malayalam univ campus: NGT seeks revised report,"This story is from February 17, 2020

Malappuram: An expert committee constituted by National Green Tribunal to study the environmental impact of the construction of permanent campus for Thunjathezhuthachan Malayalam University in Vettam panchayat near Tirur has been directed to submit a revised report to the tribunal.

A hearing of the tribunal held on February 6 has directed the committee to submit the new report within two months.

On September 18, 2019, the tribunal had constituted a committee comprising officials of Kerala State Wetland authority, Kerala Coastal Zone Management Authority, Principal conservator of forest, representative of MoEF, district collector etc to inspect the area to find out as to whether necessary clearance has been obtained from requisite authorities and whether any violations committed. The committee had submitted report that there is no construction on site now and if the university is going ahead with the project, a CRZ status report has to be prepared. And it also clarified that university should obtain necessary environmental clearance under environment impact assessment notification (EIAN) 2006 and its amendments.

But tribunal has observed that all facts mentioned in the report are vague and general in nature. “The report has not mentioned as to whether the area is ecologically fragile or whether some restrictions needs to be imposed. They have also not mentioned about the number of trees in the property and whether it can be treated as a deemed forest as defined by the apex court in Godhvarman’s case,” says the tribunal.

It was in November last year that the revenue authorities officially handed over the 4.2 hectare land to university authorities to set up permanent campus. The land was acquired by government for Rs 16.63 crore.

Earlier, there were protests from the part of UDF, alleging that there is political agenda behind the decision to acquire the environmentally sensitive land. Following this, the government avoided the mangrove area of the proposed land and acquired 4.2078 hectare land for the university.

The decision to acquire the land was taken after the visit of expert committee which found that the land was most appropriate for setting up the campus.

Sidhique Pathavoor of Youth Congress said the tribunal’s direction to submit revised report should be welcomed as it exposed the hidden agenda of government to support the land owners.

The tribunal will consider the case once again on April 1.

148,['17/02/2020'],Muzzling dissent and democracy at one go,"This story is from February 17, 2020

Chennai: On February 14, deputy chief minister began his budget speech with compliments to the police for making the state ""Amaidhi Poonga"" (Garden of Peace). Within hours, the Chennai police demonstrated how they achieve this ‘excellence’ by crushing democratic dissent. And this time their target was mostly a peaceful group of women.

February 14 was also Valentine’s Day, which some young women in Chennai wanted to celebrate in an innovative manner. The idea was to get together and have a ‘Date-with-Democracy’ to celebrate the gift of freedom and liberty. By no means was this a protest or threat to public peace. Their ‘crime’? Not genuflecting before the local police and taking their ‘permission’.

How did the police react? They barricaded and cordoned off the venue. As some young women tried to walk in they were accosted, detained and confined in a police van kept ready for the purpose. Soon, five of them were whisked away to Mylapore police station. They were not informed of the charges since there were none. Under public pressure, police let them off at about 8.30pm.

On the same evening in another part of the city, a gruesome game was being enacted. Close to 1,000 women and a few men sitting in peaceful protest at Old Washermenpet against the Citizenship Amendment Act were subjected to indiscriminate lathicharge by the police, leaving many injured. About 140 people were arrested without any valid charge. It is understood that the joint commissioner of police (north), who had a hand in the massacre of 13 people at Thoothukudi during the anti-Sterlite protests in 2018, supervised this brutality.

The Chennai city police are doing this by grossly misusing Section 41 of the Madras City Police (MCP) Act 1888, an anachronistic, archaic colonial legislation that was meant to ruthlessly crush any protest or dissent against the British. By no stretch of imagination could this be relevant to free India.

In an autocratic manner, police insist that citizens should get ‘permission’ from them to perform even basic democratic rights and duties. The very mention of dissent sends them into a tailspin, and a large posse of personnel is deployed to intimidate and threaten ‘protesters’. More often their attitude is menacing and an arrest or detention without any charge has become routine.

Sub-Section 41(1) of the MCP Act does not specify citizens should seek ‘permission’ from police for conducting any assembly or meeting in a public place, certainly not in a private place or hall. The section only authorises the police commissioner to regulate. It does not give him/her any powers to ""prohibit"" or ""prevent"" any assembly. Such power is found only under Sub-Section 41(2): ""…Commissioner may, by order in writing, prohibit any assembly, meeting or procession if he considers such prohibition to be necessary for the preservation of public peace or public safety.""

This sub-section had become redundant and should have been scrapped as soon as the Code of Criminal Procedure was enacted by Parliament in 1973 incorporating Section 144 giving this power and authority to district magistrates. Prohibitory order under this provision has a chilling effect on citizens by depriving them of their fundamental rights, particularly Article 19 (assembling peacefully and without arms and practising or carrying on any occupation, trade or business) and Article 21 (life or personal liberty). But it has built-in checks and balances and clear Supreme Court guidelines. Sub-Section 41(2) has none and applying this, police have become dictatorial. Since the Chennai police chief is vested with both police and magisterial powers under these two acts, there is ‘double-jeopardy’ for citizens with the Commissioner acting as super-cop and magistrate.

This is detrimental to the survival of democracy. In the event, Tamil Nadu government should forthwith repeal the obnoxious Sub-Section 41(2) and reinstate the precious gifts of freedom and liberty to the people without police menace. If not, before long Chennai may slip from ""Garden-of-Peace"" to ""Graveyard-of-Democracy.""

149,['17/02/2020'],Pump owners get police help to refuse fuel in bottles,"This story is from February 17, 2020

Representative Image

NAGPUR: The Vidarbha Petroleum Dealers’ Association (VPDA) has decided to refrain from supplying petrol or diesel in plastic bottles from their outlets, in the backdrop of the latest crimes of setting people afire or destroying evidence.

Two such recent cases were the rape and murder in Hyderabad, and setting afire of Ankita Pisudde at Hinganghat on February 3, leading to her death a week later. In yet another incident, a woman was set afire by her paramour at Lasalgaon near Nashik on Saturday.

Though there is a special provision under Petroleum Rules 1976, allowing supply of one litre petrol for emergency in containers or bottles, the police department and also pump owners are ensuring this is being avoided. Notices have been put up at pumps across city to this effect. The notices warn customers forcibly demanding petrol or diesel in bottles or containers.

The cops wanted pump owners to stop supplying petrol or diesel in takeaway containers or bottles as a preventive measure. The pump owners and dealers do not want to sell petrol or diesels in bottles to avoid being dragged into the criminal cases, for violating rules, and other legal hassles.

City police chief BK Upadhyay too had ensured crime branch coordinated with the issuance of circulars to police stations, to ensure notices were sent to all pump owners and dealers within their jurisdiction.

“Pump owners were told to practice caution regarding sale of petrol or diesel to customers in bottles and easy takeaway containers. Citizens were also asked to desist from forcing pump operators to give petrol or diesel in bottles,” said the CP.

The dealers and owners from city too had approached Upadhyay, requesting him to issue a precautionary notice for the public not to press for supplying petrol or diesel in bottles or containers. The owners met the top cop shortly after the arrest of a pump owner in Hyderabad in the rape and murder case, for having provided petrol in container to the culprits, who used it to set the victim’s body afire after the murder.

Harvinder Singh Bhatia, past president of VPDA, said the association members were keen that Upadhyay issue notices so that they can paste it in prominent places at the pump so as to discourage customers from making such requests. “Customers often create ruckus at the pump demanding petrol or diesel in plastic bottle. Now, we have a notice pasted at a prominent place that such demands would not be tolerated, and police would be alerted,” he said.

Amit Gupta, incumbent president of VPDA, said citizens should maintain optimum level of fuel in their vehicles to avoid inconveniences. “Members of our associations were alerted regarding the legal complications facing us if petrol procured from our pumps was used to commit a crime,” he said. “In cases of genuine requirement, we would like to take guidance from police regarding emergency situations,” he said.

Additional CP, crime, Nilesh Bharne said the prohibitory order is not a blanket ban but can be improvised in case of emergency like for ambulances or other essential services. “Depending upon the circumstances, if the requirement is genuine, then the rules can be relaxed,” he said.

A supporter leaves little to imagination

NEW DELHI: Through a positive nationalism campaign, the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) is trying to connect with over 1 crore people across the country within the next month.

The day results for Delhi assembly elections were announced — February 11 — the party launched a ‘ Rashtra Nirman ’ missed-call campaign through which over 11 lakh people connected with AAP in 24 hours. This campaign, which will run from February 23 to March 23, is now being taken to all parts of the country by the different state units of the party.

In a meeting at chief minister Arvind Kejriwal ’s residence with party functionaries from different states, senior AAP functionary and Delhi minister Gopal Rai directed them to take the campaign to their respective states and spread the message of positive nationalism. “Positive nationalism has defeated the negative nationalism in Delhi elections. We have to tell the people of this country that India needs positive nationalism,” Rai said after the meeting.

Aware of the political advantage it has reaped in the assembly polls with a soft-Hindutva stance, which involved the promise of a deshbhakti curriculum in Delhi government schools and visits to temples by the chief minister, AAP hopes that it can use this as a plank to connect with people and expand its footprint nationally.

The party has given a three-point action plan to its functionaries in different states. First, a state-level meeting of all active volunteers should be conducted immediately. Secondly, posters be put up inviting people to join the Rashtra Nirman campaign and finally, the state leadership would conduct press meets in their state capitals to disseminate the message of nation-building.

Thiruvananthapuram: The Centre has asked all state governments to emulate the Kerala model of providing free uniforms to school children . Union textile ministry has written to all states in this regard, said industry minister E P Jayarajan .

The Centre has asked all handloom directorates in each state to explore the possibility of providing free uniforms to students every academic year. “In the letter written to all states, Union textile ministry has pointed out that Kerala has ensured jobs and maximum wages for weavers through this. The state has also ensured minimum wages for weavers,” said the minister.

The report prepared by National Institute of Fashion Technology, which points out that the free uniform scheme has changed the livelihood of weavers in the state, has also been attached with the letter sent to all states, said Jayarajan.

He said it was to save the crisis-ridden weaving industry that the government came out with the free-uniform scheme. The scheme has benefited about 8.5 lakh children in the state. The government school students from Class I to Class VII and aided school students from Class I to IV are given free uniforms.

About 42 lakh metre of cloth is needed to stitch the uniforms for 8.5 lakh students in the state. Kerala State Handloom Development Corporation Ltd (KSHDC), which is popular for its brand name HANVEEV, is distributing the handloom uniform cloths from Kasaragod to Thrissur districts. Meanwhile, Handloom Weaver's Co Operative Society Ltd (HanteX) is distributing them in schools from Ernakulam to Thiruvananthapuram districts.

152,['17/02/2020'],"Vadodara: Chewing gum is good for dentists, cracking crime too","This story is from February 17, 2020

VADODARA: While you may be chewing a gum to keep your mouth busy, you wouldn’t know what service your trivial act is doing to your dentistry. Now, chew this — chewing gum has also found its importance in the field of forensic science too!

A new research has shown the way on how commonly available chewing gums can become an easy and cost-effective alternate to alginate, a material that is currently used to record dental impressions by dentists and forensic officers.

Using a normal chewing gum and a solution that was prepared in the laboratory of Gujarat Forensic Science University (GFSU), Dr Arushi Chawla, assistant professor at city-based Parul University has prepared a gum base that can record dental impressions.

“Currently, patients suffering from severe malocclusion (a condition when the dental formation is not uniform) complain of face gagging (feeling of vomiting) when they are treated through conventional method using alginate. Similarly, those having severe dental anxiety also face gagging and become very anxious about the materials used for collecting dental impressions,” Chawla explained.

“The gum base that we have developed takes dental impressions without causing any gagging or anxiety to the patients. It is also useful for patients having xerostomia (dry mouth),” said Chawla, who carried out the research as a post-graduate student of GSFU under guidance of Dr Dhwani Patel .

When using alginate, the model has to be prepared within 30 minutes or an hour of taking the impressions. “But the chewing gum base prepared by us has shown negligible changes even after two or three days,” said Chawla, whose research paper has been shortlisted by the Australian Journal of Forensic Sciences.

From the perspective of forensic sciences, the gum base can be used if crime suspects refuse to give consent to record dentition (dental formation) on the grounds of dental anxiety.

The gum base which is awaiting patent has proven to be useful to record even minute details efficiently.

Chawla and her guide are set to commercialise their research after it receives patent.

“We can use any kind of commonly available chewing gums except the juicy ones for preparing this gum base. Also, this gum base costs less than Rs 100 per person considering the cost of chewing gum and the solution, making it much more economical compared to alginate,” she said.

NEW DELHI: A private school teacher was caught red-handed when she tried to abduct a nine-month-old girl from an apartment in south Delhi’s Safdarjung Enclave on Saturday.

According to the police, the woman was caught after the household help of the family alerted the neighbours. The incident was reported on Saturday afternoon, when the toddler was playing with her grandmother, Anita Mittal, at Arjun Nagar apartment.

Mittal said the woman rang their door bell around 12.30pm and as soon as she opened the door, the accused attacked her with a knife, leaving a deep gash on her cheek. “My granddaughter was in my arm at that time. The woman snatched her away from me and tried to run. However, our household help heard me scream and caught hold of her,” she added.

The accused and the help got into a scuffle and seeing neighbours gather, she dropped the baby on the floor and tried to flee. However, the security guard of the apartment managed to catch hold of her.

Speaking to TOI, Mittal’s son, Akshay, said: “Our family has been disturbed and shaken by the incident. By god’s grace, my daughter is fine even though the woman dropped her on the floor.”

During a search, the knife used to attack Mittal was recovered from the accused’s possession. She was later handed over to the police. DCP (south) Devender Arya said a case of kidnapping, trespassing and causing hurt has been registered against her.

The accused told the cops that she had planned to kidnap the child to ask for a ransom from the family members.

Representational Image

PANAJI: The high court has upheld the life imprisonment and fine imposed by a trial court on two accused for kidnapping and abusing a 11-year-old boy with learning disabilities and demanding a ransom of Rs 20 lakh in 2011.

The two accused were sentenced to life imprisonment and fined Rs 1 lakh each in 2017. They appealed to the high court against the conviction in 2018. The court found that the boy’s testimony, with details of the events that transpired, inspired confidence and was sufficient to bring home the charges against the two.

The court noted that additional public prosecutor Pravin Faldessai proved the case beyond reasonable doubt.

The case pertains to 2011, when the two men entered into a conspiracy and kidnapped the minor boy with learning difficulties in the afternoon from outside the gate of his school. They then called his father and uncle demanding a ransom of Rs 20 lakh, failing which they threatened to kill the boy. They then drove the boy away in a van, before he was rescued by police.

Underscoring the need to maintain the privacy of the victim, the court directed the registry to transmit all the records back to the children’s court so that the boy’s identity, which appears in various records, be protected.

The court found that in several places, there was reference to the victim’s name. “This is to be avoided at all costs,” the division bench comprising justices Mahesh Sonak and M S Jawalkar stated in their judgment on Friday.

They added that the Goa Children’s Act, 2003, which deals with the procedure before the children’s court, specifically provides that the children’s court abides by the principle of right to privacy and confidentiality of the minor child, and that these be protected by all means and through all stages of the proceedings.

“Therefore, we direct that the name of the minor child in the records shall be masked, no doubt, by maintaining the records regarding the identity of the minor child in sealed cover,” the high court stated.

157,['17/02/2020'],Will govt radically review creamy layer for OBCs?,"This story is from February 17, 2020

NEW DELHI: Will the Centre lower the threshold for “creamy layer” for the OBCs which will bring them more easily in the income bracket that disqualifies them from availing the Mandal reservations?

As the government appears close to a decision on the report of an expert committee to review the criteria for determining the creamy layer, laid down in the 1993 Office Memorandum (OM) of the DoPT, it is learnt that the panel has made some crucial recommendations to “simplify” the said OM. One of them concerns the key “income criteria” to determine the creamy layer.

According to sources, it has been recommended that income criteria be made uniform for all groups by basing it on the Income Tax Act. It means inclusion of “salary” and “other sources” while keeping out “agri income”. If salary is included, it would put OBCs in the creamy layer bracket much easily — thereby putting them at a serious disadvantage. The issue has been a source of controversy for last six years since the government started including “salary” in the income of parents working in PSUs , while excluding it for those working in state and central governments. It has lowered the disqualifying bar for PSU households.

At the heart of the problem is the absence of “equivalence” of posts in PSUs — tagging posts as Group A/B/C/D as in Central/state governments. While ‘Group A’ falls in “creamy layer”, ‘Group B’ is eligible for quotas with caveats. In the absence of “equivalence”, the 1993 OM says “income criteria” will apply.

On complaints from successful UPSC candidates from PSU background who were denied quota, two HCs have termed the practice as “discriminatory”. However, it is learnt that government may stop short of any radical revision of the 1993 OM, which could be controversial. As an option to revising the income formula, the panel is learnt to have recommended “uniform criteria” for equivalence across three categories – government, PSU and private sector. In another recommendation, The panel is learnt to have suggested that income for creamy layer should be indexed. What it apparently means is that an objective parameter be set against which the income ceiling should be increased.

Aurangabad: The result of the objections on ward reservation and formation will be declared within two days as decided in the hearing held by the State Election Commission on Saturday.

The hearing on the objections ward reservation and formation wards of the Aurangabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) took place at Maulana Azad Research Centre

It started at 10.15 am and continued until late evening on Saturday.

IAS officer Saurabh Rao, four election commission (EC) officials, municipal commissioner Astik Kumar Pandey, head of the election department of AMC Kamlakar Phad and other officials of the AMC’s town planning department were present in the hearing.

According to Jaisingpura corporator Afsar Khan, the panel heard his objections and gave directives to the AMC election department to make the necessary changes. Khan had raised concerns that while defining the boundaries of his ward, the natural boundaries including a river and a 200-ft road were overlooked due to which 500 voters were added to his ward. Khan expressed confidence about winning his case.

Meanwhile, Rahul Ingle, civic activist had objected the reservation of Cidco N-3, N-4 ward. “The ward has never been reserved for scheduled caste. For AMC 2020 elections, the ward is reserved for the OBC. Also, the addition of two lanes of Nyay Nagar, which were removed from the ward in 2015, is questionable,” he said. Ingle, however, said that the panel did not seem positive on resolving his objection.

According to Kranti Chowk corporator Shilpa Rani Wadkar, two enumeration blocks (EBs) were added intentionally to her ward to reserve those for SC candidate. “I explained to the panel the newly added area does not have any residential colony as it is an open space. So, the addition of 1,200 voters based on the new area added is questionable,” Wadkar said.

Around 30 objections of Satara and Deolai was heard at on Saturday late evening.

Ahead of the civic elections in April, the reservations for 115 wards of the AMC was announced on February 3. Between February 4 and 11, the election department of the AMC received 372 objections from citizens including office-bearers, corporators and aspiring candidates.

160,['17/02/2020'],Tadoba gets 2 more ranges to help manage wildlife areas better,"This story is from February 17, 2020

NAGPUR: In a bid to manage it better, Tadoba-Andhari Tiger Reserve ( TATR ) in Chandrapur has been reorganized with two additional ranges. This will help the park get 26 more forest guards at no additional establishment expense.

Over 625sqkm TATR includes Tadoba National Park (116sqkm) and Andhari wildlife sanctuary (509sqkm). Area of both combined was notified as a tiger reserve on February 23, 1995.

The 625sqkm TATR is spread in three ranges — Tadoba, Kolsa and Mohurli — manned by three range forest officers (RFOs), nine round officers and 34 beat guards. Considering various threats and administrative work along with tourism management, the strength proved insufficient.

“With each RFO looking after a vast area of over 200sqkm, we had moved a proposal to reorganize the core area adding two more ranges — Kolara and Karwa — by redistributing same area to five RFOs. The proposal was approved by a committee headed by PCCF (HoFF) at a meeting on January 27,” said TATR field director NR Praveen.

Now, TATR will have five ranges — Tadoba, Karwa, Kolara, Mohurli and Kolsa. The headquarters of these ranges will be based in Wadala, Kolara, Mohurli, Karwa and Zari, respectively.

Praveen said with addition of two ranges, Tadoba core with same area will have 15 round and 60 beat guards. The area under patrolling will also go down by over 50%.

On additional staff, Praveen said the reorganized area will require two RFOs, six round officers and 26 forest guards. The post of two RFOs will be made available by shifting posts of Mohurli (Protection) and RFO (Research) in Tadoba office.

“Similarly, six round officers will be shifted from Gadchiroli forest division, 18 forest guards will be shifted from Chandrapur division and eight will be made available from deputy director (core) office. No new posts will be created and will not put any financial burden on the state exchequer,” said Praveen.

The field director added, “Reorganization was one of the proposals mentioned in the approved tiger conservation plan (TCP) of TATR. The fresh move will help manage wildlife areas better.”

Thiruvananthapuram: Fish workers’ organisations have demanded the state government to provide immediate financial assistance to fishermen “as they were struggling to make ends meet due to poor catch in the sector”.

“Various factors, including climate change, unscientific trawling near to the shore and pair trawling, have led to the reduction of our fish production. Fishermen are now in a state of poverty,” said a joint statement issued by Kerala Swathanthra Matsya Thozhilali Federation (KSMTF) state president Jackson Pollayil and National Fish Workers’ Forum general secretary T Peter, here on Friday.

They said fishing with powerful LED lights, making use of power generators, was also affecting the marine wealth. The government, it demanded, should take immediate measures to confiscate vessels involved in juvenile fishing and vehicles transporting the catch to factories, and to cancel their permits. “If the government fails to keep vigil on the matter, fish will vanish from our dining tables and the fishing community will plunge into extreme poverty,” the statement said. tnn

Thiruvananthapuram: CPM state committee has ruled out the need for any judicial probe into the CAG findings against DGP Loknath Behera and home department . “The findings of CAG will be probed by public accounts committee (PAC), which is the usual procedure. There is no need for any judicial probe,” said CPM state secretary Kodiyeri Balakrishnan.

“CAG has not reported any corruption in the home department. It have only said that funds have been diverted,” he said. “Bullet shortage is not a new thing. It has happened before and even when I was the home minister. The rifles have not gone missing. Now, if you take stock of the rifles, it will be there. The only lapse has been in maintaining the register,” said the CPM state secretary.

He raised suspicion about the “leaking” of the CAG report before it was tabled in the assembly. The report was received by a few before it was tabled and this had come up in the assembly debate also. Hence, the CAG itself has to probe whether its report was leaked, he said.

Kodiyeri alleged that it was unfortunate that the CAG had convened a news conference and came out against the state police chief in the open. “It is unusual that the name of an officer is mentioned for the alleged lapses found by the CAG,” he said.

“The period during which the alleged lapses mentioned by the CAG took place, the state had four DGPs. Hence, the blame cannot be put on a single officer,” Kodiyeri said.

He also flayed the opposition for demanding a CBI probe into the report. “Congress has a newfound affinity to seek CBI probe into every case. But, this is not the opinion of their national leadership. They are here to create controversies,” said Kodiyeri.

Aurangabad: The round-the-clock protest against the implementation of Citizenship Amendment Act, National Register of Citizens completed 21 days on Friday in Udgir in Latur district.

The agitation started on January 22 under the banner of Udgir Citizens Forum headed by town’s leading gynaecologist Dr Anjum Fatema Qadri. The participants performed a ‘yagya’ — a holy ritual — to mark the occasion at Mahatma Gandhi Garden. Locals said the spot was turning into a place for protest for members of all communities.

Bhagyawati Bajaj – Raichure, a senior activist, led the yagya ritual. She recounted that her family shifted to India from Pakistan after partition and they had experienced difficulties in securing citizenship. She claimed that common citizens would face hardships of NRC is implemented.

“My daughter is married and stays in Assam. I have personally witnessed what one has to undergo to prove his or her citizenship during NRC. It is nothing but harassment of the commoners, irrespective of their caste and religious beliefs,” she told TOI.

She said that the yagya was organised for seeking special blessings for the politicians so that they have a change of heart and do not go for divisive politics.

Echoing her, Manorama Jadhav, a teacher with secondary school, said they performed the yagya so that good sense prevails on our politicians, who are misleading people.

A few labourers, who were digging the basement of an adjacent building, got trapped under the debris. While firemen and police managed to rescue two of the trapped labourers, a third was extracted from under the debris after almost five hours and could not be saved.

An initial probe suggested that the debris from the demolition of the second and third floors had piled up on the first floor. This led to the collapse. The labourers alleged that despite informing the contractor and the builder about the possibility of an accident, no steps were taken to remove the debris.

An FIR of causing death due to negligence has been registered and the contractor, Nidhish Gupta, was taken into custody by police.

The fire department said they received a call at 2.13pm about the house collapse in E-Block of CR Park . “Five fire tenders and 35 firemen, along with civil defence personnel, carried out the rescue operation,” said Atul Garg, director, Delhi Fire Service (DFS).

The injured labourers have been identified as Sudama (21), Sanjay (30) and Tappan Mandal (25), while the deceased is Toormal Mandal (32). Jiten Mandal, another labourer , had a miraculous escape after a stone hit his helmet cracking it into pieces, but his head got saved.

A senior South Delhi Municipal Corporation official said that the incident involved two houses. “Construction was going on in one of the houses and the owner had all documentation. Their neighbour was demolishing the old structure during which the wall fell on the labourers. Police will take further action,” he added.

Aurangabad: A 28-year-old woman committed suicide by hanging herself at her residence in Sengaon in Hingoli district in the early hours on Friday.

The women has left behind a suicide note alleging three people had raped her and demanding that action be taken against the trio. Police rounded up the suspects named in the suicide note on Saturday.

Police authorities said that in the suicide note, the woman, a tailor by profession, alleged that in 2015, she was raped by the three people, who recorded her video and blackmailed her. Fearing social stigma, she registered a case of sexual harassment against the suspects.

After an offence was registered in 2015, the suspects were arrested but later released on bail. The probe was completed in course of time and a chargesheet filed. The woman started attending the court after her case came up for hearing in 2019.

The hearing of the case is still underway. In the recent hearings, she was frequenting the court for cross examination by the defence lawyer.

Police authorities said that during one such hearing she attended last month, she attempted suicide in the court room by inserting her finger in the switch board. Later, she submitted a written apology, which the court accepted and absolved her.

Superintendent of police, Hingoli, Yogesh Kumar told TOI, “The woman has left behind a suicide note mentioning about the three people who had raped her. We have rounded up the three suspects and probing what triggered her to take the extreme step.”

The officer confirmed that they were also probing if the uncomfortable questions asked to her for cross examination during the hearing of the case led her to take the extreme step.

Sources said that police were also thinking of taking legal opinion in the case. “It is a matter of legal question. The suicide note can be treated as a piece of statement for prosecuting the accused with rape charges,” said an officer.

Panaji: Keen on saving nearly 30MLD of treated sewage water from going down the drain, the state government is eyeing alternative non-potable uses for it. It has even invited individuals to avail of the water free of cost.

Based on a request from the Sewerage and Infrastructural Development Corporation of Goa Ltd (SIDCGL), the directorate of municipal administration (DMA) has made it mandatory for all municipalities to use this water to wash vehicles and water municipal gardens, among other non-potable purposes.

The DMA circular has stated that usage of treated drinking water for non-potable activities be discontinued. It has also asked urban bodies “to coordinate with the officers of PWD and SIDCGL for ensuring appropriate use of grey water/treated water from the STPs existing and functional within your jurisdiction”.

Goa is not afflicted with water shortage like other parts of the country and the cost of treated drinking water here is among the lowest in India. As a result water from STPs finds no demand. However, the DMA has reminded municipal bodies that putting treated sewage water to use is mandatory under the national urban sanitation policy and waste water reuse and recycle policy.

“The ministry of housing and urban affairs, government of India, has directed that recycling and reusing of treated waste water be considered to the highest possible extent,” deputy director DMA Deepesh Priolkar told municipalities. The urban governing bodies have also been told to submit an action taken report to the DMA.

The SIDCGL has said that even individuals can avail of the water free of cost, without any restriction on minimum quantity. “Now, anyone with need for water for non-potable use can come forward and take the water from our STPs at no cost,” SIDCGL managing director P B Seldarkar said.

Currently, SIDCGL and PWD operate two STPs each in Panaji and Navelim, and one each in Vasco, Durbhat and Sancoale.

SIDCGL was initially planning to tie up with industries and bodies like ICAR for reuse of the treated sewage water for industries and agriculture, but with no pipeline to supply the treated water, transportation costs are turned out to be substantial.

TIMES VIEW

Getting government bodies to use treated waste water is a welcome but limited move. The government must seriously think of developing its reuse as a sector by putting in place a distribution network and charging for the water. Allowing free usage is a temporary measure and will never impress upon people its ecological and economic benefits. Water resources are under pressure already and the increasing population is only going to further it, bringing with it hiked tariffs and water shortage. Addressing the usage in a planned and phased manner is paramount.

Times News Network

Jaipur: To encourage the ease of doing business in the pharmaceutical industry in the state, the health department has fixed timelines for various documentation and licences to be granted by the state drugs control office.

The initiative is aimed to infuse confidence among drug manufacturers. This is reportedly the first time the government has issued such directions.

The state government is aiming to attract pharmaceutical companies to set up their manufacturing unit to increase employment opportunities. “Rajasthan government is keenly committed to improving ease of doing business in order to attract investment and create employment in the state,” said Rohit Kumar Singh, additional chief secretary, health department.

He said, “Drug manufacturing sector has immense potential in the state. By providing a hassle-free and conducive environment to the new and existing businesses in the sector, we expect to catalyse manufacturing and export from the state.”

In an attempt to bring investors of pharmaceutical companies, the health department on February 11 issued a notification stating that manufacturing licence for medicines would be given in 21 days with inspection being done in 10 days, shortcoming rectification and verification work will be completed in seven days, screening of product will be done in three days and processing and granting of licence will be done in just one day.

The Rajasthan Pharmaceutical Manufacturing Association (RPMA) has expressed happiness over the decision as fixing timeline for various documentation and licences will boost the section. “The state government is developing the state as a pharmaceutical hub. The state government is showing commitment by fixing the timeline. With the timely paperwork many things will change for the business. This will bring more confidence among manufacturers,” said Vinod Kalani, president, RPMA.

COIMBATORE: Phone snatchers are having a free run in the city. In the last few days, several snatching cases were reported from VOC Nagar and the police quarters in the Saravanampatti police limit.

C Anand Kishore, 18, a native of Malappuram district in Kerala, had lost his phone to a three-member gang on February 8. A first-year diploma student in a private polytechnic at Peelamedu, Kishore was on his way to a relative’s house from the company he was doing internship. The gang stopped him on the pretext of verifying an address when he reached the police quarters at VOC Nagar around 8.50pm. Though he said he could not help them as he was new to the area, the men asked him to hand over his phone to make a call. They fled as soon as they got hold of the phone.

The Saravanampatti (crime) police refused to register a robbery case, Kishore said. “They issued a complaint acceptance receipt after four days, which only says that the phone is missing,” he told TOI.

Three days ago, a man who had stopped his motorcycle to make a call at VOC Nagar, was targeted by a three- member gang, which attempted to snatch his phone.

Meanwhile, activists want police to install more automatic number plate recognition (ANPR) cameras to stop such incidents. “It is difficult to trace the motorcycles used by snatchers as they are using fake registration plates. However, ANPR cameras will help police,” said an activist.

PANAJI: The state government has decided to prohibit fishing vessels and pleasure crafts from venturing close to Raj Bhavan, which is perched atop a sea-facing cliff at Dona Paula , due to heightened security around governor Satya Pal Malik ’s official residence.

The captain of ports department has issued a notice to mariners informing them that canoes and cruise boats carry out fishing and water sports activities within the vicinity of Raj Bhavan has been prohibited with immediate effect.

Malik was governor of Jammu and Kashmir when the region was bifurcated by the Centre. The decision to abrogate Article 370 was also taken under his tenure.

COIMBATORE: The Madras high court has directed the city corporation not to commence operation of the micro compositing centre (MCC) being constructed at the open space reservation (OSR) land of Thiru Vi Ka Nagar in Vadavalli. The court said that the issue deserves to be resolved by constituting a larger bench as it involves a large public purpose.

To reduce the amount of garbage being brought in to the Vellalore dump yard, the civic body had proposed to decentralize waste collection and disposal by constructing MCCs at 65 places across the city, including some on OSR lands.

However, residents have been opposing the move, stating it is in violation of the Tamil Nadu Town and Country Planning Act, 1971. “The site earmarked for park should not be used for any other purpose as per the Act. Now, the corporation is violating the Act,” said M Chakravarthyanand, a resident of Thiru Vi Ka Nagar.

Opposing the move, Thiru Vi Ka Nagar residents took up the issue with the HC eight months ago. After hearing both the sides, the division bench dismissed the petition stating that the interest of the society is paramount, and the court does not find any breach of public interest in the action.

The residents filed writ appeal challenging the directions of the division bench. Hearing the petition on February 7, the court said, “The authoritative pronouncement is warranted by a larger bench on issue as to whether the layout plan finalize as per the provisions of Tamil Nadu Town and Country Planning Act, 1971 read with the development control rules framed thereunder permits certain permissible deviations therefrom in larger public interest or not?”

The court further directed the corporation not to commence the operation until the final directions are given.

Chakravarthyanand said that the site is in the foothills of Marudhamalai. “If the centre starts functioning, smell of garbage would attract wild animals including boars and elephants to the residential area,” he said.

Meanwhile, a corporation official said that the centre will be constructed on a portion of land and the remaining portion will be developed into a park. “No foul smell would emanate from the centre and it would not cause any inconvenience to the public,” he added.

Counter complaints were filed at Valpoi police station in the matter

VALPOI: A quarrel between landowners and a family of the Dhangar community took an ugly turn on Saturday when the access road to the family’s residence at Gaonkarwada, Pissurlem was blocked.

According to a complaint filed by the Pissurlem panch member Sangeeta Mote at the Valpoi police station , Sairaj Parab, a resident of Deulwada, dumped soil of laterite stones infront of the pathway leading to her house, thus blocking access.

“We filed a complaint soon after the incident. However, Sairaj along with Vasudev Parab, Akshay Parab, Sunay Parab and Manohar Parab arrived in the evening and lifted the soil using an excavator, cutting off our access road completely,” she alleged.

Mote also stated that she was manhandled when she attempted to rescue her nephew who was assaulted by the accused.

Meanwhile, a counter complaint was filed at Valpoi police station by the Parab family who denied the allegations, and stated that the access road falls within their property and that they have every right to close it.

Sapna Parab said that some workers from a nearby industrial area who use the pathway were consuming alcohol and creating a nuisance. “We were fed with this. Hence, our male family members blocked the pathway,” said Parab.

President of the Dhangar Samaj Sangh Sattari, B D Mote said the land was granted by the government to their community members and that they should not be harassed by landowners.

“I condemn this incident and urge the government to look into matter. We will not tolerate such harassment to our community. If the government is ignoring our pleas, we will approach the Human Rights Commission both at the state and national level,” he said.

An FIR has been registered at Valpoi police station against the miscreants who dumped the soil on the pathway.

AK Velayudhan and KU Divakuran

THRISSUR: Two forest watchers were burnt to death while they were trying to douse a fire in a forest plantation area near Desamangalam Kottambathur in Wadakkacherry on Sunday.

The deceased are K U Divakaran and A K Velayudhan of Poongott forest station, according to district forest officials. Both were reported to be tribal watchers. Another watcher, V A Sankaran, who was seriously injured, has been admitted to a hospital.

Preliminary reports indicated that the fire began around 3pm and the watchers had rushed there to douse the fire. However, the fire intensified and they got trapped in the fire and thick column of smoke which engulfed the area. Later, local residents, who reached the spot, saw the watchers lying on the ground with severe burns and rushed them to the hospital.

Forest department sources said the acacia plantation was given on lease to Hindustan Newsprint Limited (HNL). They alleged that HNL had neither set up a fire line nor deployed enough watchers to prevent fires for the last two years. Lack of adequate safety measures was the main reason for the fire. The plantation had witnessed some incidents of fire last year also, the forest sources said.

Efforts are still on to douse the fire with fire brigade personnel joining the operation.

Meanwhile, forest minister K Raju condoled the deaths and said appropriate decision on providing financial support to the kin of the deceased and injured will be taken.

On Saturday a fire broke out in the basement of the five-star hotel around 9am.

NEW DELHI: Delhi Police on Sunday suspended the licence of The Park , a day after Delhi Fire Services had suspended its fire clearance certificate.

On Saturday a fire broke out in the basement of the five-star hotel around 9am. Though the blaze was doused by hotel staffers, the smoke reached the above floors through air-conditioning ducts. Guests panicked and tried to break open windows, and at least a couple of them sustained injuries.

Fire officials were, however, not informed about the blaze. An inspection by a team of officers from the fire department revealed a list of ten shortcomings with regard to fire safety at the hotel in Connaught Place.

According to officials, a major tragedy was averted as there were improper exit signages, open electrical shafts and encroached fire exits.

An official from the fire department visited the hotel on Saturday to inspect the fire prevention and safety measures at the premises. “Electrical shafts at the hotel were not sealed, manual call point — which is used to activate the fire alarm and detectors — was not functional, pressurisation and ventilation was on manual mode, refuge area was encroached, a few areas were not covered by water sprinklers, fiber sheets cabin in refuge areas were not removed, at service floors housekeeping officers needed to keep the corridor free, set back area was encroached and exit signages were not in place,” the official stated.

In view of the shortcomings mentioned, the official said, the fire safety clearance issued to the hotel stands suspended till the shortcomings are rectified. He added that the department would check on the shortcomings and take a final call on the cancellation of NOC at a later stage.

Cops, on the other hand, revealed that they had not received any information about the fire from hotel authorities. “It was only when the patients reached the hospital, fellow police officers from adjoining district informed us about the incident. We will take legal action against the hotel,” said an officer privy to the investigation.

Despite repeated attempts by TOI, there was no response from The Park.

COIMBATORE: A three-member gang stabbed a 20-year-old college student to death after he refused to hand over his cellphone at Sulur on Saturday night.

D Tamilselvan of Sadayan Thottam in Nadu Arasur, a IIIrd year Mechanical Engineering student at the GRG College of Engineering and Technology at Kalapatti, was on the way home after completing project work, when the gang targeted him, police said. “He was passing through Nadu Arasur around 11.30pm when three men on two motorcycles tried to snatch his phone. When the boy raised an alarm, the miscreants stabbed him on his chest and fled from the place,” a police officer said.

A profusely bleeding Tamilselvan managed to reach his home and told his father about the incident. Though he was rushed to a nearby private hospital, doctors declared him brought dead.

181,['17/02/2020'],"Draft bill excludes dental hygienists, mechanics","This story is from February 17, 2020

Aurangabad: Scores of dental professionals, with expertise as hygienists and in the mechanics streams of dental medical science, have been left out of the National Dental Commission (NDC) bill’s draft.

These two are the key streams of dental science’s four streams: masters in dental surgery (MDS), bachelor in dental surgery (BDS), dental hygienists (DH) and dental mechanics (DM).

Professionals and students in the dental hygienists and mechanics streams have now called for an immediate repeal of the proposed draft bill. They have also demanded the implementation of long-pending reforms in the four streams.

Many said the proposed bill, for which objections have been sought by the health ministry, completely leaves out the two of the four streams. Professionals said the bill remains silent even on their names as well as definitions. The last date to submit objections is February 20.

Mahendra Amrutkar, the secretary of the Government Dental Mechanics’ Association, Maharashtra, said: “The definition, role, responsibility and duties of dental mechanics and hygienists have been adequately mentioned in the Dentist Act, 1948. But knowingly or unknowingly, these details have been deleted from the proposed bill.”

Those belonging to these streams now fear the passing of this bill will not only leave them jobless but will also impact the overall oral healthcare system in the country. A dental hygienist acts as an oral health counsellor and dental health educator and is supposed to help maintain effective oral hygiene. A dental mechanic is responsible for the preparation of artificial teeth, dentures, night guards, crowns, orthoplates, surgical plates, space maintainer and inlays.

Shrikant Borade, vice-president and advisor to the Federation of Indian Dental Hygienists’ Association, New Delhi, said there are 313 dental colleges in the country, of which, only about 10 offer specialised DH and DM courses. Moreover, the state has only one college, out of the 33 dental colleges, that offers courses in these subjects.

“In the past 72 years, the country has produced about 2.75 lakh dentists,” said Borade. “But in that same time, the country has produced only 3,533 DHs and 3,176 DMs. These figures are seriously in violation of standards set by the World Health Organisation for developing as well as under-developed countries.”

Threatening to launch an indefinite agitation, DHs and DMs are also thinking of approaching the courts against the proposed NDC bill, which according to them, is discriminatory and a direct violation of the Constitution that guarantees equal and proportionate distribution of opportunities.

Office bearers said as per existing law, even unqualified part-B dentists from 1948 to 2018 have a right to cast vote, make representations or nominations at the Dental Council of India and the State Dental Councils.

The fire occurred in the MNC near VUDA circle: (R) Wiring and false ceiling panels got burned

VADODARA: A major fire broke out at the city office of a multinational company involved in market research and consumer data study on Sunday afternoon. Fire department had to declare a ‘major call’ to douse the fire which engulfed second and third floors of the building near VUDA circle .

According to officials of the MNC – Numerator, a minor short-circuit in the server room could have sparked the fire. The two floors were currently not operational and nobody was present there and the fire spread quickly. Fire officials said the first response team could see flames and smoke bellowing out of windows and thus a ‘major call’ was announced.

Fire department sources said both floors were covered with thick smoke due to which firemen had to break glass windows and install exhaust machines to remove it. “Air-conditioner ducts, wirings and false ceiling panels were engulfed in flames. As these structures got burned, they started collapsing as well and so we had to be careful,” said a fire official. “The building’s structure was damaged to a large extent due to heat so we continued with the cooling process for some time,” fire officer Manish Mod said.

Company’s officials said operations are currently on only on ground floor. “Since it was Sunday, not many people were present on ground floor as well and there were no casualties,” company’s human resources director Suchit Patel said.

On learning about the fire, municipal commissioner Nalin Upadhyay reached the spot. “Our priority was to ensure that there were no casualties and as it was a Sunday, very few people were present in the building,” he said.

Although the company officials claim that a short-circuit could have ignited the fire, fire department will be taking help of forensic experts to ascertain the exact reason for the blaze. The company had shifted to the building in November last year and was planning to extend its operations on upper floors in the coming months.

VADODARA: A government schoolteacher from Dabhoi lost Rs34,172 from his bank account as he was conned by a man posing as a customer care executive of a mobile payment services company.

Victim Jignesh Panara told police that he received a call from on January 26 mentioning that the company PhonePe had given bonus to him . Panara was asked to check his account on the application and get back. But as no bonus had been received, the duo exchanged several phone calls. The caller asked Panara to send him a message through the application. When Panara sent a message as instructed by the accused, Rs3,172 got deducted from his bank account.

Panara was angered by deduction but was promised that he will get his money back by downloading another application – TeamViewer QuickSupport. Panara was instructed to enter his bank account number and a few minutes later Rs31,000 was deducted from his account. Panara asked the accused how his money was debited. The conman told him that he had no idea about the deduction. But when Panara did not receive any call, he realized that he had been cheated. tnn

Jaipur: Air connectivity from Jaipur to other cities is likely to decrease in the upcoming summer schedule of the flight operations.

Though new flights to Chennai and Pune are coming up, by and large Jaipur airport is likely to have 56 to 58 flights per day, down from the current 63.

According to sources at the Jaipur airport, the summer schedule, which is likely to be introduced from March 29, will have lesser flights from the Jaipur airport.

“It is expected that there would be some decrease in the flights from Jaipur when the summer schedule is released. Presently, a total of 63 flights operate daily from Jaipur airport. These include 56 domestic and 7 international flights. The domestic flights connect 18 destinations across the country. In the revised schedule, the number of flights is likely to be 56 to 58,” said a senior officer on Sunday.

All the airports across the country change their flight schedule twice a year. Sources added some flights, including from Delhi, Mumbai and Bhopal, will be suspended in the new schedule. “Also in the new schedule the Jaipur airport will get a direct flight to Chennai,” he added.

The flights, including Jaipur-Bikaner and Jaipur-Dharamsala, are unlikely to resume in the summer schedule. “Similarly, there are lesser chances of revival of flights to Jammu and Chandigarh,” said a senior officer.

188,['17/02/2020'],Delhi voters rejected BJP bid to spread hatred: Azad,"This story is from February 17, 2020

Representative Image

YAVATMAL: Voters in Delhi have rejected ruling BJP leaders’ attempts to spread hatred during assembly polls there and chose love and brotherhood by ensuring victory of Arvind Kejriwal-led Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), said opposition leader in Rajya Sabha and senior Congress leader Ghulam Nabi Azad .

Azad was addressing Congress workers’ rally at Wadafale Palace on Jamb Road on Saturday.

Azad further said BJP ministers and MPs tried to polarize voters by raking up Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) and National Register of Citizens ( NRC ) instead of tackling several burning issues like economic slowdown, rising unemployment etc faced by the country.

The senior Congress leader was in the city for the felicitation of newly elected party MLAs and ministers from the region.

Prominent among those felicitated during the function included ministers Ashok Chavan, Vijay Wadettiwar, Yashomati Thakur and legislators Sulabha Khodke, Amit Zanak and Amar Rajurkar.

Former MPCC president Manikrao Thakre, former Rajya Sabha member Vijay Darda, former minister Shivajirao Moghe, MPCC women’s wing president Charulata Tokas and several others were also present.

Dubbing the present Union cabinet as ‘election campaign committee’ of BJP, Azad said it’s acting as an agent of promoting religious polarization in the country.

In 2005, Congress-led government had introduced Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme to enhance rural population’s buying capabilities, said Azad, adding the present dispensation has cut the budget allocation for the scheme. “Similarly, the government speaks of doubling the income of farmers, but here too the budget allocation for agriculture has been reduced,” pointed out Azad.

Speaking on the occasion, Vijay Darda expressed concern over the debacle of Congress in Vidarbha and urged party leaders to shoulder the responsibility of regaining the people’s support.

The basement where the girls were made to sleep during their period

Rajkot: A day after four women staffers , including the principal , of Bhuj-based Shree Sahajanand Girls Institute were booked for outraging the modesty of 68 girls, the victims now fear a different kind of backlash for their mutiny.

The girls now are frightened that principal Rita Raniga, who is dominating by nature and the main culprit who orchestrated the shameful exercise, may heap serious reprisal on the girls. Monday’s strip test opened a Pandora’s box of other issues with the institute.

Talking to TOI, the victim said: “It’s not that all the teachers were in favour of Raniga’s exercise. There were many teachers who objected and one of them was even thrashed by Raniga for trying to physically protect the girls. Raniga often insulted teachers in the assembly hall in front of all the students.”

Raniga “asked her (the teacher) not to interfere in the matter” and also gave a deaf ear to many other teachers who pleaded her not to go ahead with the test, said one of the victims.

The girl further said that the teachers who started to voice their objections verbally after a few students began to cry, “were told by Rita Ma’am to keep quiet if they wanted to continue in the job”.

Such is their fear for her, that students have nicknamed Raniga as “terror”.

The girls also said that the claim that they are informed of all these rules prior to admission is false. “When we joined the college we were not informed about the rules regarding periods at that time. Only after joining we came to know about these strict rules. We are also not allowed to wear western outfits in college and have to wear traditional clothes only. If a legging is slightly above the ankle, the student is punished for wearing such a short garment,” another student said, insisting repeatedly not to be quoted for fear of being tormented again.

The girls also complained that they are made to clean the entire hostel area owing to a shortage of staff inside the hostel. They are also ordered to help the kitchen staff in cooking and cleaning.

Slug: Latur Road railway station

Aurangabad: Locked toilets at the Latur Road railway station have irked passengers, especially the elderly. The Latur Road railway station witnesses around 40 trains halting per day and has three platforms.

A senior railway official said that toilets at stations where no major passenger footfall is observed are locked up and the keys are kept in the station master’s office.

However, railway authorities at the Latur Road station said, “The public toilets at small railway stations are deliberately locked up in order to avoid nuisance from a section of outsiders. Such errant elements do not maintain the proper cleanliness and make these facilities dirty. The keys of locked toilets are kept at the office of station master and legitimate passengers can use toilets as and when needed.”

A retired government official and his family said that they faced a lot of inconvenience due to closure of the public facility.

“I was travelling to Hubli with family from the Latur Road railway station. A few male and female family members tried to locate the toilets but found that both men and women toilets were locked up. A little inquiry around the station was of no help and we had to wait for the train to arrive,” he said on the condition of anonymity.

The divisional manager of Secunderabad division of the South Central Railway (SCR) could not be reached for his comments.

Meanwhile, Panvel-Nanded (17613) train was running three-and-a-half hours behind schedule on Saturday, causing inconvenience to passengers.

Railway authorities said that some technical work was being carried out in the jurisdiction of the central railway was the reason for the disrupted schedule of a few trains, including Panvel-Nanded.

Bengaluru: The allocation for National Institute of Mental Health and Neuro Sciences (Nimhans) in Bengaluru has been slashed by 4% (nearly Rs 19 crore) in this year’s Union budget.

While Rs 411.8 crore was allocated to the prestigious mental health institution during 2018-19, it was Rs 453 crore according to the revised outlay for 2019-20. This year, the budgeted outlay for Nimhans is Rs 434 crore.

Speaking about the slash in allocation, Nimhans director BN Gangadhar pointed out that their projects will now have to be prioritised. “It is a 4% cut in budgetary allocation. Considering this, we have to tighten our purse and ration our priorities. We need to decided which are the new projects to be stopped or stalled,” he said. Gangadhar pointed out that if they fall short of funds, they will seek additional grants later in the year.

Scheme may help

“We could probably get more patient-related returns from the Ayushman Bharat scheme. A lot of patients fall below the poverty line and a sizeable number would be beneficiaries of the scheme. We will probably supplement the deficit from the scheme amount. If we still fall short, we could ask for additional grants during the revised budget estimate in the latter part of the year. Some internal revenue could go up with patient-related returns,” he said.

However, there was only Rs 3.4 crore difference in the actual and revised budget figures of 2019-20. “We will make more efforts to encourage patients to enrol for Ayushman Bharat,” he added.

NEW DELHI: The Joint Coordination Committee (JCC), the students and alumni group of Jamia Millia Islamia , and the varsity administration are at loggerheads over the viral CCTV footage of December 15 from the library in which policemen are allegedly seen using lathis to beat students.The video, which shows policemen entering the first floor of Dr Zakir Husain Library ’s old reading hall and using lathis on students studying there, has earned condemnation from all sections of the Jamia community.While the Jamia administration released a statement mentioning that they were not involved in the CCTV footage leak, JCC hit back at them for failing to condemn the police action.Jamia PRO Ahmed Azeem, in the statement, said, “We have come to know that some video with regard to police brutality in Dr Zakir Husain Library is in circulation. This is to clarify that the video has not been released by the university.”The administration added that JCC, which is spearheading the movement against CAA/NRC/NPA outside gate number 7 on Mohammed Ali Jauhar Road, is not an official body of the varsity. “Any communication from JCC should not be taken as communication from the university,” the statement said.In response, JCC said, “Their (Jamia’s) statement shows that they are not concerned about students and would rather shirk off their responsibilities towards them. The administration has still not taken action against police for entering the campus and violently attacking students.”On the viral video, a Joint Coordination Committee member said, “It corroborates the barbarity of police in how they dealt with the students.” The group also alleged that police were trying to leak unverified videos that had no proof of any violence by students. “Police are trying to save themselves and coming out with videos painting students as rioters despite there being no proof of it,” JCC claimed.Majid Jamil, Jamia Teachers’ Association secretary, said, “Is this the training that the Delhi Police has got?

Aurangabad: The civic authorities have appealed to the people to take part in the citizen perception survey in order to decide the Ease of Living Index 2019-20 of the cities across the country.

The survey is being carried out by the Ministry of Housing and Urban Poverty Alleviation (MoHUA) in the wake of the lingering civic issues such as erratic water supply, poor conditions of internal roads and ineffective garbage disposal.

Aurangabad had poor Ease of Living Index last time when it had secured the 97th place among 111 cities surveyed by the central authorities.

When asked about no major development on civic issues since the last Ease of Living Index was declared, authorities said the situation has improved highly. “Barring the issue of water supply, we have progressed on issues involving roads, garbage and healthcare. New roads have come up in several areas, while the effective disposal of garbage is being achieved,” the officials of the Aurangabad Municipal Corporation said.

“As a part of the Ease of Living Index assessment, a citizen perception survey is being conducted for the first time. The survey carries 30% of the marks for the total exercise and hence assumes huge significance. As the survey is aimed at directly capturing the perception of the citizens, we appeal to all the residents to take part in the exercise,” civic authorities said.

The survey is being administered online and offline until February 29. The offline version involves a face-to-face interview with a questioner. The survey is available on https://www.mygov.in/.

As per the official notification issued by the MoHUA, the Ease of Living Index 2019-2020 will assess the ease of living of citizens across three pillars-the quality of life, economic ability and sustainability which are further divided into 14 categories across 50 indicators.

The survey participants have a chance to win cash prizes.

197,['17/02/2020'],"Put treated sewage water to use, Goa govt tells urban bodies","The urban bodies have been asked to discontinue use of treated drinking water for non-potable activities

TimesView Getting government bodies to use treated waste water is a welcome but limited move. The government must seriously think of developing its reuse as a sector by putting in place a distribution network and charging for the water. Allowing free usage is a temporary measure and will never impress upon people its ecological and economic benefits. Water resources are under pressure already and the increasing population is only going to further it, bringing with it hiked tariffs and water shortage. Addressing the usage in a planned and phased manner is paramount.

PANAJI: Keen on saving nearly 30MLD of treated sewage water from going down the drain, the state government is eyeing alternative non-potable uses for it. It has even invited individuals to avail of the water free of cost.Based on a request from the Sewerage and Infrastructural Development Corporation of Goa Ltd (SIDCGL), the directorate of municipal administration (DMA) has made it mandatory for all municipalities to use this water to wash vehicles and water municipal gardens, among other non-potable purposes.The DMA circular has stated that usage of treated drinking water for non-potable activities be discontinued. It has also asked urban bodies “to coordinate with the officers of PWD and SIDCGL for ensuring appropriate use of grey water/treated water from the STPs existing and functional within your jurisdiction”.Goa is not afflicted with water shortage like other parts of the country and the cost of treated drinking water here is among the lowest in India. As a result water from STPs finds no demand. However, the DMA has reminded municipal bodies that putting treated sewage water to use is mandatory under the national urban sanitation policy and waste water reuse and recycle policy.“The ministry of housing and urban affairs, government of India, has directed that recycling and reusing of treated waste water be considered to the highest possible extent,” deputy director DMA Deepesh Priolkar told municipalities. The urban governing bodies have also been told to submit an action taken report to the DMA.The SIDCGL has said that even individuals can avail of the water free of cost, without any restriction on minimum quantity. “Now, anyone with need for water for non-potable use can come forward and take the water from our STPs at no cost,” SIDCGL managing director P B Seldarkar said.Currently, SIDCGL and PWD operate two STPs each in Panaji and Navelim, and one each in Vasco, Durbhat and Sancoale.SIDCGL was initially planning to tie up with industries and bodies like ICAR for reuse of the treated sewage water for industries and agriculture, but with no pipeline to supply the treated water, transportation costs are turned out to be substantial.",goa,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74172692,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-58027,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/put-treated-sewage-water-to-use-state-tells-urban-bodies/articleshow/74166074.cms
198,['17/02/2020'],Manipur Nagas’ biggest festival has a song for Wuhan,"Singer Rewben Mashangva performs the song at Ukhrul on Saturday

The Nagas of Manipur on Saturday chose their biggest cultural stage to extend solidarity to the embattled residents of Wuhan , the epicentre of the coronavirus outbreak.At a time when the global conversation around Covid-19 is shot through with racist overtones, and people from the northeast are facing racially motivated taunts in other parts of India, a prayer-song – ‘Stay Strong Wuhan’ – performed by Naga folk blues legend Guru Rewben Mashangva , was one of the top draws at the Lui-Ngai-Ni 2020, the two-day annual ‘seed sowing’ festival of Manipur’s Naga tribes held at the Tangkhul Naga Long ground in Ukhrul town, 2000km west of Wuhan.Mashangva, one of the best-known musicians from the northeast, performed the song in English, interspersed with Tangkhul, Nagamese and Mandarin. The song has been written by Ngachonmi Chamroy, a well-known Tangkhul lyricist, and the words – “On the empty streets of Wuhan/ Fear and despair roam/ Wearing the face/ Of coronavirus today” – are evocative. They also blend well with the theme of this year’s Lui-Ngai-Ni, ‘oneness through culture’.“Some friends and I hit upon the idea of writing a song in support of Wuhan on February 13 (Thursday). It took us around 40 minutes to write the lyrics. We decided that the Lui-Ngai-Ni would provide us with a big platform to present the song,” Chamroy told TOI over the phone.“It pains us to see China being vilified across the world. People are referring to the Chinese as sick Asians and to coronavirus as yellow fever. We from the northeast have faced such discrimination before, and we wanted to send the message of solidarity to the people of Wuhan through this song,” Chamroy said, adding that this was why he decided to add Mandarin lyrics to the song (‘Jianqiang de zhongguo/Jianqiang Wuhan’ or ‘Be strong China/Be strong Wuhan’).For the Tangkhul-speaking Mashangva, the lyrics in English posed a big challenge. “I spent all of Thursday just going through the words. My English is not good. Finally, I took the help of my daughter and my wife to get the pronunciations right. Even then, I had difficulty with words like ‘heartache’,” said the 58-year-old singer, who counts Bob Dylan as his biggest inspiration.None of that mattered, however, to the 2,000-odd people who were in attendance when the song was performed on Saturday, as traditionally dressed members of the Naga tribes held up giant banners proclaiming ‘Stay Strong Wuhan, We Are With You’. “The audience reaction was great. We got so many phone calls from our friends across the world, including China, for the song,” said Chamroy.The performance of the song at the Lui-Ngai-Ni 2020, organised under the aegis of the United Naga Council, the apex body of Manipur’s many Naga tribes, is just the first step, the singer-lyricist duo said. By Monday, they hope to give a studio finish to the song, add more female vocals and release it as a video online.The Lui-Ngai-Ni, often described as the second most important festival of the Naga tribes after the Hornbill Festival, is a state holiday in Manipur. Besides the coronavirus epidemic, the other development that multiple speakers at the event referred to was the much-awaited Naga peace accord signed by the Centre with various Naga groups.",guwahati,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74164308,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-71961,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/guwahati/manipur-nagas-biggest-festival-has-a-song-for-wuhan/articleshow/74164309.cms

Bengaluru: The high court directed the government to pay Rs 10 lakh to a Mandya lawyer for denying him the post of assistant public prosecutor-cum-government pleader despite him being more qualified than the chosen candidate.

PC Revanna, an advocate from Pandavapura , was not selected to the post 10 years ago; Ashok Kumar, another candidate, was chosen on the basis of inflated marks.

A division bench of Justices G Narendar and M Nagaprasanna directed the government to recover Rs 10 lakh from the officers responsible for Ashok Kumar’s selection.

Ashok Kumar, who is assistant public prosecutor-cum-government pleader at the JMFC court in Sedam, Kalaburagi district, had challenged the Karnataka State Administrative Tribunal’s October 24 order which set aside his appointment. The tribunal had directed the government to pay Rs 10 lakh compensation to Revanna, apart from recovering the salary paid to Kumar all these years.

The high court dismissed Kumar’s petition but modified the tribunal’s order. Since Kumar has been assistant public prosecutor for nearly 10 years, he deserves sympathy, the bench said, noting that it would be improper to recover his salary.

Earlier, Revanna had approached the tribunal contending that he had secured 86.2% marks in the written test and viva-voce as against 84.4% secured by Kumar. Despite that, Kumar’s name figured in the provisional selection list published on April 12, 2010, which showed he had secured 87.4% marks.

Thiruvananthapuram: The offerings are minimal: buttermilk, water and banana. Yet, the handcart set up at the venue of the zero waste conference at University College captures the spirit of the conference. The pushcart was fashioned out of a rusty old frame and deflated, torn tyres dumped in the corner of the material recovery facility at the Medical College Hospital.

Thomas Varghese, a volunteer with the Green Army had taken a picture of the facility and when ideas were invited for decorating the venue of the conference he was reminded of it. He got together with other members of the Green Army, Arun, Anoop and they were aided by city sanitary worker Shyju. They retrieved the frame and tyres and in two hours the pushcart took shape.

The frame was repainted. Abandoned wood pieces were procured from a Nedumangad timber merchant for a good bargain. These were spread out over the frame. Rags were placed above the splinters and they made for an ethnic table sheet. The got hay at Rs 100 and shaped a roof out of it.

They decided to distribute water, buttermilk and bananas and another trip was made to Nedumangad, this time to a clay factory that made earthen tumblers. The Green Army volunteers lapped up damaged pieces for a nominal price. They had some work to do, though. The broken pieces were put together and small holes were sealed. An abandoned faucet was added and the water dispenser was ready.

Bananas were an after-thought and a message was posted on the cart: banana is free, but waste is your responsibility.

From the opening day itself, the shop was a hit, drawing even VIPs like finance minister Thomas Isaac and MLA V K Prasanth. “We wanted to do something different and the abandoned pushcart was the first thing that came to mind,” said Thomas Varghese. The team says they got the entire shop done for below Rs 2,000.

The city corporation has decorated the entire venue with recyclables. Abandoned beer bottles flashing coloured works also dangle along the path to each venue. “We wanted the venue to look as eco-friendly as possible. The students lived up to the challenge,” said an official.

Locust presence in the state is limited to a small area in Sriganganagar

JAIPUR: Locust presence in the state is limited to a small area in Sriganganagar and it is no longer a big menace for farmers. The Locust Control Organisation, Jodhpur, on Sunday said India and Pakistan would sit for a meeting to come up with a joint strategy to combat the menace in June.

Since May 2019, 10 districts were under the attack of the pests and according to an official estimate crops on nearly 3.6 lakh hectares were damaged by the insects. The districts included Hanumangarh, Bikaner, Sriganganagar, Jaisalmer, Barmer, Sirohi, Jalore Jodhpur, Nagaur and Churu.

On the present status of locusts, Dr KL Gurjar, deputy director of LCO said, “By and large, it is contained in the state except its scattered presence in Sriganganagar district and few other areas. Currently, none of our teams is on the task of containing locusts anywhere in the state. Amples of pesticides and other resources have already been given to farmers to take up measures to keep locusts away from their farms.”

Gurjar informed that India and Pakistan would sit for a meeting on locust control in June. “We will sit to come up with a result oriented strategy and enhanced mutual coordination. Since May 2019, both the countries have witnessed the worst ever locust attack. Thus sharing mutual information and coordination is a must. Pakistan had to declare locust attack as a national emergency,” he added.

However, farmers who have started harvesting Rabi crops including mustard are not much bothered about the locusts. “I have harvested my crop and there is nothing locust can damage. Let’s hope its zero presence during the upcoming monsoon,” said Khajaan Singh, a native of 14 LD village near Gharsana area of Sriganganagar district.

BENGALURU: The Karnataka Secondary Education Examination Board has sent question papers of SSLC preparatory exams — beginning February 17 — to schools. But they are miffed by the fact that the papers are bundled inside what they describe as ‘black colour garbage bags which are anything but foolproof’.School managements say the bags can be easily opened by anyone and this shows the board’s lack of seriousness towards the preparatory exam.The KSEEB is conducting statewide preparatory examinations for the first time.“The way the question papers have been dispatched has worried heads of many schools in the city,” said the headmaster of a high school.“While we usually get them in bags, which have a cloth lining inside and are sealed with wax, this time we got the papers in garbage bags that were bound by cellophane tape. Anyone can remove the tape and there are chances of the papers being replicated and distributed.

VADODARA: Kevadia police on Sunday booked a travel agent for overcharging fee for entry to the Statue of Unity (SoU). The police said eight tourists from Rajkot had bought entry tickets to SoU from the agent. The cost of a ticket was Rs280 but the agent charged Rs320 from the tourists.

The cops have begun investigations to track down the agent. This is third incident of travel agents duping tourists.

The SoU management has trained its men to find out duplicate tickets or cases of tourists being overcharged for entry to the statue.

In the first week of February, a ticket coordinator at SoU had noticed anomalies in the entry fee rate on the tickets that the tourists from Delhi had produced. Saiyad got 10 express tickets having Rs1,260 written on them towards entry charges whereas the actual entry fee is Rs1,030 per person.

The matter was reported to SoU officials who then filed a complaint with police.

The tourists told police that they had booked the tickets from a Delhi-based travel agency that in turn had got them from Rao Travel Agency .

The accused duped the tourists of Rs2,300. One person was arrested in the case. In May 2019, a travel agency was also busted for overcharging on SoU entry tickets.

SoU officials have urged the visitors to directly book the tickets online without involving any agent.

A public notice has been recently issued by the North Goa district collector

PANAJI: Three hundred and fifty vehicles have been identified as ‘ abandoned ’ within the limits of Panaji , said mayor Uday Madkaikar, adding that these vehicles are perennially parked in the city.

The Central Motor Vehicles Act, 1988, states that any such vehicle which is left unattended for more than 10 hours or is damaged, and is creating a public hazard will be considered an abandoned vehicle.

People who have carelessly abandoned their vehicles in various nooks and corners of the state capital may have to part with them for good.

As of June 24, 2019, the number of abandoned vehicles occupying valuable parking space in Panaji stood at 200 vehicles.

“Currently, there are a total of 290 two-wheelers and four-wheelers that have been identified in 2019-20, thus far, that are parked in the city, round-the-clock. In addition to this, we have received a list of additional 60 vehicles that were found abandoned,” Madkaikar said.

He also said that a public notice has been recently issued by the North Goa district collector listing the details of these vehicles and requesting their owners to remove their two-wheelers or four-wheelers.

The deadline specified for this is March.

“We have the full power to auction such vehicles after March. Immediately after the expiry of that date, we’ll start auctioning the vehicles,” the Panaji mayor said.

The Central Motor Vehicles Act, 1988, holds the police responsible for the removal of such vehicles. The act also gives powers to state governments to order for a motor vehicle to be moved or removed.

NEW DELHI: With the country’s security in mind, Indian Space Research Organisation (Isro) is gearing up to launch an unprecedented 10 earth observation satellites with space surveillance feature during 2020-21, according to the annual report of the Department of Space.

In comparison to 10 earth observation (EO) satellites, only three communication satellites and two navigation satellites are scheduled to be launched in the next financial year starting April this year. In the past, Isro had never given so much impetus in boosting its surveillance powers and the focus was more on communication satellites. A huge number of EO satellites suggests Isro’s priority is to boost space surveillance in order to keep an eye on terror launchpads along the borders, checking infiltration and keeping an eye on China’s naval activities in the Indian Ocean Region.

For the current fiscal year 2019-20, Isro has planned 17 missions. Of these, six are yet to be completed and are expected to be launched by March 31. Of the six EO satellites planned, four have been launched and two are likely by the end of the current fiscal. In fiscal year 2021-22, the space agency will target to add eight more EO satellites.

Besides their widespread use for civil applications related to land, water and environment like agriculture, forestry and water resource management, EO satellites are actually “eyes in the sky” that provide constant surveillance.

The 10 earth observation (EO) satellites include the high-tech Geo Imaging Satellite Gisat-1 that has the capability to do real-time earth imaging. “Gisat-1 will do a full rotation of the Earth and come to the same point after every 2 hours. It is really good for fast imaging of the Earth and can perform constant and rapid surveillance. If needed, the satellite can observe a point for a longer duration,” says a source in Isro.

The other EO satellites include highly advanced radar imaging satellites RISAT-2BR2, RISAT- 1A and 2A (with high agility X-band synthetic aperture radar ), Oceansat-3 and Resourcesat-3/3A & SA. Risat satellites with high-spatial resolution will provide all-weather, day and night imaging services from space. They will be good for space surveillance and will mainly be used by security forces.

According to the annual report, Isro has planned in all 36 missions, including satellites and launchers, in 2020-21. These missions include the launch of three space science satellites, one technology demonstrator test, two small satellite launch vehicle demonstration tests, 10 PSLVs, three GSLV Mk-II, one GSLV-MkIII and one unmanned flight of Gaganyaan in 2020-21.

Isro is also planning to launch a new series of high-resolution satellites (HRSATs) that will be a constellation of three satellites packed together in a PSLV. These three satellites will be placed in space to provide systematic coverage of high resolution panchromatic and multispectral data. They will provide images with better than 1.0 m resolution with 15 km swath. The constellation is meant for large-scale land mapping.

A budget of Rs 13,480 crore has been proposed for the next fiscal in the recent budget for the Department of Space. Of it, Rs 265 has been allocated under the Space Sciences category and Rs 750 crore under the Insat Satellite System category. Most of the EO satellites to be launched in 2020-21 will be funded from the money allocated under these two categories.

the city’s perennial pothole problem

COIMBATORE: Satire has become a device to highlight the city’s perennial pothole problem and the apathy of civic authorities in fixing it.

Commuters were amused to see a hoarding placed near a pothole on the Mettupalayam Road near GN Mills , which shows a gaping crocodile getting ready to swallow two men on a motorcycle.

Authorities have not repaired the pothole even after 10 months, said M Devendran, secretary of the Coimbatore District Road Safety Association, who had placed the hoarding. “The road was dug up to lay new drinking water pipelines. With the flyover construction going on at GN Mills, the pothole has become an inconvenience and a threat to public safety. Since Saturday night, water began to leak from the pipe, filling the pothole,” he said. “After streetlights were removed for the flyover construction, the area is prone to accidents, especially during the night hours.”

The association wanted to attract the attention of both the public and the officials to the issue, Devendran said. “We decided to place the board after petitioning both the Tamil Nadu water and drainage board (TWAD) and the national wing of the state highways department several times,” he told TOI. “When we approach the highways department, they pointed fingers at TWAD.

Thiruvananthapuram: Though the previous two monsoons were devastating for various urban areas, the city did not experience major waterlogging, thanks to various initiatives such as Operation Anantha. But officials of irrigation department have pointed out that canal cleaning works should be completed as a follow-up action before the rains sets in this year.

Though irrigation department has initiated works to clean parts of Pazhavangadi Canal and Thekkenakkara Canal, it is stuck on an unexpected hurdle. Though the department has issued tenders for five cleaning works worth Rs 15 lakh, no contractor has taken it up citing lack of options to dispose the waste from the canal.

“The state government has allotted the money under the state disaster relief fund to remove the waste accumulated in Pazhangadi Canal and Thekkanakkra Canal. Despite retendering the project several times, none of the contractors have agreed to take up the works. They say there is no plot where they could dump the waste, which include loads of plastic waste,” said an official.

The department had contacted the corporation seeking its support. “However, they too have similar project at hand. They are burying waste in an available plot with the support of local councillors,” the official said.

In a question posed by VS Sivakumar MLA in the assembly recently, water resources minister K Krishnankutty had informed that the difficulty in finding a plot to dispose waste was the key hurdle in executing the work.

In June 2019, the department had prepared an estimate of the accumulated waste. Now, the waste might have piled up much beyond their initial estimate. Despite erecting fences, the dumping of plastic waste continues unabated in the canals.

Another project, the renovation of Amayizhanchan Canal worth Rs 25 crore had received approval but the project got delayed for incorporating works of Kerala Water Authority, including purchase of a multi-functional amphibious machine for canal cleaning works. After revising the DPR, the irrigation department has now submitted it to a working group for approval.

COIMBATORE: The house break-in case reported at Luna Nagar near Kavundampalayam in November 2019 has taken a new turn with the Thudiyalur police asking the complainant to produce proper documents for the stolen gold ornaments.

The move comes after the burglar, who is now in police custody, told cops that he had taken away only gold ornaments weighing 50 sovereigns and Rs3 lakh from the house, while the compliant said 134 sovereigns gold and Rs15 lakh were stolen.

A police officer said, “We have asked the complainant to submit valid documents for the stolen gold items. We want to verify the fact.”

Earlier, the Mannuthy police in Thrissur district in Kerala had arrested Pattarai Suresh, 32, a native of Madurai, in December 2019 for robbing an elderly couple there. During inquiry, he told them that he was involved in a burglary at Luna Nagar near Kavundamapalayam. Immediately, the Kerala police alerted the Thudiyalur police, who brought Suresh to the city through prisoner transit warrant a week ago.

Three days ago, the Thudiyalur police was granted his custody for four days. Since then, a team led by Thudiyalur police inspector S Balamurali Sundaram has been interrogating him.

With around a week left before US President Donald Trump ’s visit to the city, Gujarat police have formed a special 500-strong anti-morcha team to tackle protesters . Made up of SRP jawans and local cops, the anti-morcha team will keep a tab on protests of any kind by citizens and prevent flare-ups. With citizen protests over various issues, including NRC and CAA on the rise, police are now keen on nipping such demonstrations in the bud.

“A big job of the anti-morcha team will be to gather intelligence on where people are planning to hold protests and stop them from taking out rallies,” said a police source.

Kalim Siddique, one of the organizers of the silent demonstrations against the CAA and NRC bills in Rakhial said that the organizers were called by police officers and politely told to end the protest before Trump’s visit.

“We have been told to hold a programme and end the protest in a silent manner. We are as such protesting very silently and doing nothing that would disturb the law and order situation of the city,” he added. Police officials said that protests or demonstrations with any potential of disturbing the law and order situation during Trump’s visit will be dealt with according to the law.

Sources said the anti-morcha team has activated informers to learn in advance of protests planned during Trump’s visit. “Apart from that the cyber cell of the city police and Gujarat police have been asked to keep a tab on known rabble-rousers,” a police source said.

A senior crime branch official said members of the anti-morcha team will be stationed near the Motera stadium and other places where the US President might visit.

100 volunteers of Hindu Jagran Manch were involved in the cleaning

VADODARA: An architectural marvel, which had been the cynosure of the Banyan City for more than 120 years now, is getting burried under decay and administration’s abject apathy. Shocking images of its dilapidated interiors came to the fore on Sunday when around 100 volunteers of Hindu Jagran Manch clean one wing of the famed building.

The heritage Nyay Mandir building which imparted justice to hundreds of people for more than a century was a majestic place replete with its huge corridors and open squares, until two years ago. But lack of desired attention have slowly turned the hallowed corridors into a jungle of ruins with garbage and wild trees growing in abundance.

Members of the right-wing group, who task themselves every Sunday with cleaning of statues of prominent persons installed across the city, took up the cleaning of Bhagat Singh’s statue installed outside the Nyay Mandir this Sunday.

The building, along with one wing of the heritage structure, which is currently in possession of the district court administration, is inaccessible to general public.

Volunteers said that they gathered almost two trucks full of garbage that had been accumulating in one of the two open squares. Members collected the garbage and kept it in one corner as it was difficult to move anything out of the building. “Wild bushes have engulfed the entire area and are also slowly killing the old trees which once provided shade,” said one of the Manch members.

The group also cleaned the historic central hall and the glass showcase of Maharani Chimnabai ’s statue. The exteriors of the building were also cleaned as it has been covered with bird droppings and DDT powder sprinkled by the Vadodara Municipal Corporation . Another member of the group said that they had to use masks while cleaning the exteriors unable to bear the stench of urine. They also found liquor bottles and banned cough syrup bottles scattered all over the compound.

“Cleanliness of Nyay Mandir building is every lawyer and citizen’s responsibility. This building provided bread to lawyers and justice to the citizens for so many years,” said advocate Neeraj Jain.

220,['17/02/2020'],"Already in red, Punjab’s civic bodies face NGT’s fine threat","This story is from February 17, 2020

Chandigarh: Grappling with fund crunch, Punjab’s urban local bodies (ULBs) face National Green Tribunal’s (NGT) threat of being fined for failing to comply with the Solid Waste Management Rules, 2016, by March 31. While the poor financial health of most corporations is already causing delay in execution of developmental projects, there are civic bodies that haven’t been able to disburse even salaries to their staff. The poor financial health can be attributed to delay in remittance of the taxes by the state government even as additional grants have dried up.

According to NGT monitoring panel, the penalty will be levied from April 1 and if local bodies are unable to bear the financial burden, the liability would rest with the state government to take remedial action against erring municipal bodies. Even though the corporations claim waste management is their priority, the fund crunch is set to become a major hurdle.

Confirming that the Pathankot Municipal Corporation was unable to pay salaries to its staff, mayor Anil Vasudeva said, “We have not received even a single penny from the state government for the past three years. The salaries are disbursed out of the goods and services tax (GST) remitted. Since it is still pending, salaries are held up, leading to unrest among the staff, which is genuine. Against our entitlement of Rs 1.75 crore in January, no money has been sanctioned. That was the case in November too. This has created problems for the civic body.”

At the same time, Vasudeva, added, “Otherwise, we have adequate funds to carry out development and repair works, thanks to the 14th finance commission. However, city residents are suffering because tenders or allotments are held up at the level of the corporation itself due to bureaucratic indifference. The tax collection system is not ULB friendly and we run into deficit for various reasons. The salaries cannot be paid out of the finance commission funds. We have already raised the issue with the state government.”

Similarly, Bathinda mayor Balwant Rai Nath said the municipal corporation had not received any financial assistance from the state government to take up major developmental projects. “We are carrying out plans for village ponds or get works under AMRUT schemes. But the state government defaults on its grants out of tax every few months and it results in salaries getting delayed. About six months back, we had to raise loan of around Rs 2.5 crore to pay salaries,” he said.

“We had the intent to bring Bathinda on top of the list had the Congress government helped the corporation. During the previous SAD-BJP government, we even floated a tender for Rs 74 crore for development schemes. But things have changed for the worse after 2017. Today, Bathinda has slipped to the 16th position,” he added.

Phagwara mayor Arun Khosla rued that there was no focus on development of the city. “The roads are in bad shape, the tipper and JCB are not in working condition. The Congress government has failed to give any financial aid to the corporation. During the previous SAD-BJP term, Phagwara got Rs 30 crore that made the corporation take up many water supply and sewerage schemes. The same is the case with other ULBs and things are in a bad shape. People are fed up with the policies of the present government.”

The Jalandhar Municipal Corporation is awaiting remittance of around Rs 70 crore from the state government on account of taxes. “We had got Rs 3.5 crore about three months back and even at that time Rs 25 crore was due to us. Now, more arrears have piled up. We have managed to pay salaries of the staff. The Centre too has defaulted in giving GST compensation to the state that leads to a vicious circle and grants to the corporations are also affected,” said Jalandhar mayor Jagdish Raj Raja.

Nani lake is the only source of drinking water for Nanital

NAINITAL: A few days after reports that several areas in the Naini lake were highly polluted and the water was unfit for drinking, a team from National Institute of Hydrology (NIH), Roorkee , will visit the lake to conduct a study.

Sources said that the team will primarily study the condition of aquifers which are permeable or semi-permeable rocks that allow the underground water to come to surface. “Aquifers are a major source of freshwater for the Naini lake. However over the years, many of them have been blocked as silt may have covered them, effectively blocking the flow of groundwater to the lake,” said Ajay Singh Rawat, a Nainital-based environmentalist and former professor of Kumaun University.

Naini lake is not only a major tourist attraction but also the only source of drinking water for Nainital . For freshwater, the lake is highly dependent on the aquifers and the monsoons. “The lake used to have a very vibrant biodiversity but over the years, the rising level of pollutants and unabated construction has adversely affected it,” Rawat said.

Various studies have pointed towards the deteriorating condition of the Naini lake. A study conducted by the Indian Institute of Remote Sensing (IIRS) a few days ago had revealed that the lake has several areas which are not fit for aquatic life and the Total Dissolved Solids levels are also high in certain parts.

The administration, meanwhile, maintained that they have taken several steps to rejuvenate the lake. “The IIRS study will help us understand the topography of the lake while the NIH study will help in its rejuvenation. Apart from this, steps have also been taken to remove waste from the lake. We are committed to cleaning the lake and the condition will improve significantly soon,” said Nainital district magistrate Savin Bansal.

COIMBATORE: The Government College of Technology (GCT), which is celebrating the platinum jubilee, is all set to use the Rs 10 crore fund that the state government had allocated to it in the budget to renovate auditorium and drainage system, which are more than 60 years old. The fund would also be used to construct a sewage treatment plant, new classrooms and repair dilapidated compound walls.

College principal P Thamarai said they had sought around Rs 100 crore from the state to carry out major renovation work on its campus on Thadagam Road to mark the platinum jubilee.

“But we have been given Rs 10 crore and we are happy that we have got the fund. We would meet Public Works Department officials and carry out the work.”

Pointing out that the drainage system of the college was laid more than 60 years ago, she said, “We are looking to relay it. We would also renovate the auditorium, which is also constructed more than 60 years ago.”

The principal said the new classrooms and sewage treatment plant might cost Rs 5 crore. Presently, the college doesn’t have a sewage treatment plant.

She said the portion of compound wall bordering Venkatapuram, a residential area adjacent to the campus, was damaged and needed rebuilding. The wall on the hostel side also needed attention, she said. “These works would be done with the fund.”

Last year, a faculty training centre, constructed at a cost of Rs 9 crore, was inaugurated on the college campus. The centre is being used conduct training and development programmes for teachers from colleges across the state.

COIMBATORE: Power loom weavers in Erode seek to expand their cluster to start doing value addition to their rayon grey fabric, such as dyeing, printing , processing and making garments out of them to sell across the country. They said they would also seek to export these products if they get proper support.

Members of the Erode Viscose Rayon Fabrics Cluster said they formed the cluster in September 2018 and it has 230 small power loom owners as members now. They are now producing grey rayon fabric. For value addition, they are now sending the fabric to other places such as Delhi and Surat.

With the expansion of the cluster, they seek to create a common facility, where they could do value addition activities such as processing, dyeing and printing, making garments themselves and market it, they said. They said they would make rayon garments such as shirts and chudithars and sell it in India and possibly also in other countries, with proper support.

B Kanthavel, a representative of the cluster, said they were seeking to induct power loom weavers from the Erode Powerloom Owners’ Association into the cluster. “We have planned to invite 500 members of the association to the cluster. We plan to ask them to invest Rs 35,000 each in the cluster, so that we could allot a capital of Rs 87.5 lakh towards the common facility,” he said.

This capital would be important to get further funds from the Centre, he said. The members have sought a working capital loan of Rs 10 crore and a fund of Rs 12 crore under the cluster development scheme to set up the common facility, he said.

He said last week when the Union textile secretary Ravi Capoor visited Texvalley, a wholesale textile market in Erode, they had represented these demands to him. At the occasion, he said, the secretary also launched a viscose rayon shirt produced by the cluster.

Officials from the regional office of the textile commissioner in Coimbatore said the establishment of a common facility for value addition would eliminate the domination of master weavers, who see profit at the expense of small weavers and would enable small powerloom weavers earn directly.

M Balasubramanian, deputy director at the regional office of the textile commissioner in Coimbatore, said right now master weavers are employing micro and small powerloom weavers for doing their job work. “But if micro and small powerloom owners form a common facility, they would be empowered to do value addition to their own fabric,” he said.

Chandigarh: The Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) on Sunday asked the Punjab government to ensure it does not tamper with the reservation policy in appointments and promotions in public services, so that fundamental rights of the scheduled caste (SC) and scheduled tribe (ST) communities were safeguarded.

SAD leader and former assembly speaker Charanjit Singh Atwal said the reservation given to SCs and STs should not be diluted in any way despite a recent judgement of the Supreme Court, which states that states were not legally bound to provide reservation in government jobs and promotions. “The Punjab government should make an immediate declaration that it will stick to the current policy vis-a-vis reservation in government jobs and promotions to dispel fear that has arisen in the minds of SCs.Also, we expect the Centre to step in the same way as it did when the apex court diluted the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act. Parliament was extended by a day and status quo was maintained by law. Such affirmative action is needed now also,” Atwal said.

Calling reservation a fundamental right granted to SCs and STs in the Constitution, he said this had been reiterated by a full bench of the Supreme Court. Atwal said reservation under the Constitution was an aspect of substantive equality, which imposed a duty on states to provide it to groups who were disadvantaged in different terms.

Atwal said SAD was of the belief that reservation should be read and interpreted as part of protections and in the spirit guaranteed in Articles 14,15 and 16 (4) of the Constitution.

228,['17/02/2020'],Nagpur: Coronavirus takes sting out of chilli prices,"NAGPUR: Coronavirus continues to hit farmers in Vidarbha . After cotton, prices of chilli, which is among the crops grown in parts of Nagpur district like Umred and Bhiwapur, have been affected by the outbreak. The rates of red chilli, which opened at Rs200 a quintal, double last year’s level, have soon come down to Rs100 to 150.As the market was left with negligible carry forward stock this year, farmers were hoping to get super profits due to the Chinese demand. China is among the major importers of Indian chillies . As coronavirus has brought life to a standstill in the country, even spices trade has been hampered, leading to the rates crashing in India.“For the first time in more than two decades, the trade has been left with nearly nil carry forward stock from the previous year. This led to the rates opening at Rs200 a quintal at the start of the season in January. As China shut down due to the virus outbreak, the rates slipped to Rs120 a quintal and have settled at Rs130 to 140,” said Pankaj Agrawal, a chilli trader at the Agriculture Produce Market Yard at Kalamna.As against this, the rates were Rs80 to 90 during the same period last year and even the crop was low at that time, due to which there is no carry forward stock. The shortage led to the rates opening at a high at the start of the season only to fall after the virus hit.Agrawal said for farmers, any price above Rs100 a quintal is suitable. There are chances that the rates may still go up to Rs150 a quintal, in the coming days.Sanjay Wadhwani of M/s Riya Traders said farmers will not get the premium they were hoping due to the situation this year. China is a major market for Indian chillies. The rates have settled in the range of Rs100 to 150 a quintal, he said.“The stock comes from various parts of India, although chilli cultivation in the traditional pockets of Umred and Bhiwapur have also come down over the years. These days much of the supply comes from Guntoor in Andhra Pradesh,” said Wadhwani.Rakesh Bhatia of M/s BPL Exports in Guntoor said, “China buys nearly 3,000 tonnes from India. The chilli produce from India is not only used for self consumption in the country but also exported further to nearby nations from there.”“China prefers Indian chillies due to the taste. The crop is even grown there but their chilli is not spicy enough,” added Agrawal.",nagpur,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74170960,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1091186,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/coronavirus-takes-sting-out-of-chilli-prices/articleshow/74165331.cms
229,['17/02/2020'],"Rs 2.5cr spent on intel, many still get away with murder","This story is from February 17, 2020

Chandigarh: Spending Rs 2.5 crore on building a network of informers and gathering information about criminals in five years has done little to boost the crime solving rate of the Chandigarh Police.

Cops have failed to crack sensational gunpoint robberies, murders and kidnapping cases despite a provision of Rs 50 lakh and more kept for them every year under what is called secret service fund, commonly known as discretionary fund.

In a reply to an RTI application of a head constable, it was revealed that the police department received Rs 3 crore under this head from 2015 to 2019 and spent Rs 2.5 crore till August 8, 2019. The RTI reply said the police received Rs 50 lakh yearly from 2015 to 2017 and spent the entire money. In the last two years, police got Rs 75 lakh each year and spent 1.05 crore till August 31, 2019 — expenditure that has not yielded much dividends on the ground.

Dozens of heinous cases are lying unsolved since 2015. One of the most sensational ones was the murder of national-level shooter and advocate Sukhmanpreet Singh alias Sippy Sidhu. Five years on, his family members are still waiting for murderers to be caught. Sippy was shot dead at a park in Sector 27 on September 20, 2015. Among the latest unsolved cases is that of a robbery in a house in Sector 63 on December 8, 2019. Four armed men had entered a flat of an immigration company owner and held him and his fiancée hostage at gunpoint. The accused had fled with Rs 3.5 lakh and three mobile phones.

Charanjit Singh Virk, DSP, PRO, Chandigarh Police, said police teams have already been set up to solve the unsolved cases. “We have shared information and details with cops of neighbouring states to nab the absconding accused in henious crimes,” he said.

CITY COPS PLAY CATCH-UP

May 14, 2019 | Three armed men robbed a jewellery store in Sector 44. They cut the wires of CCTV cameras, overpowered the owner, tied his hands and legs and locked him in the washroom. The accused took away Rs 30,000 and diamond jewellery worth Rs 3 crore and pulled down the shutter while escaping.

February 22, 2018 | Three armed miscreants kidnapped Harpreet Singh, a resident of Sector 10, in his Mercedes car at gunpoint from sector 9. They abandoned him after taking Rs 3 lakh

January 10, 2018 | Four armed robbers barged into the house of Ajit Jain, a businessman, in Sector 33 and fled with jewellery and Rs 1.5 crore

June 6, 2017 | Two men shot dead a 22-year-old roadside cigarette vendor in Sector 17 near ISBT. Mohammad Nazid was killed for refusing to give cigarettes to the accused as he had closed his shop

October 13, 2017 | Abhishek Shukla, a salesman, was stabbed to death near poultry farm roundabout. Abhishek was returning home after finishing his shift from Elante Mall

Secret service fund

S C Sagar, former DSP, UT police, said the main purpose of secret service fund is to collect intelligence and pay informers in exchange of information regarding criminals. There is no provision of audit of this fund because it is spent secretly on informers, he said.

230,['17/02/2020'],Goa: 12 panchayats draw HC’s ire for not setting up dry waste units,"This story is from February 17, 2020

PANAJI: The high court of Bombay at Goa has issued notices to the sarpanchas and secretaries of 12 village panchayats for not taking steps to set up material recovery facilities for dry recyclable waste.

In its latest order, it has also directed Goa State Pollution Control Board to issue notices to the sarpanch, deputy sarpanch and secretaries of 69 panchayats to show cause why action should not be taken for their removal under Section 50 (4) of the Panchayati Raj Act.

Despite directions, the court found that 69 panchayats have not applied for any approval from the pollution control board to set up material recovery facilities, and stated that some action is warranted as it had warned panchayats in its previous orders.

The division bench comprising justices Mahesh Sonak and M S Jawalkar stated that although it is inclined to issue contempt notices to all the 69 defaulting panchayats, it decided to begin with issuing notices “…to some of the larger panchayats, which were expected to act with a greater sense of responsibility when it comes to the issue of waste management”.

The court, that is monitoring the state’s garbage management, has found that although the process is under way, it found response from the panchayats of Colva, Assagao and Calangute “quite poor” and directed the sarpanchas and secretaries of these three panchayats to remain present in court on March 4 to report on the status of compliance.

“For example, in Assagao, though the safai volunteers had reported about 14 black spots, hardly 3 were cleared. Similarly, in Calangute, though 18 black spots were reported, hardly 6 were cleared, and in Colva 27 black spots were reported, but hardly 1 was cleared,” the court observed.

It directed the panchayats to take emergent steps not only to clear the black spots, but also “develop a mechanism, by which, black spots do not recur”.

The director of panchayats was also directed to depute an officer to inspect these three panchayats and report on the occurrence of black spots.

Visakhapatnam: A city-based start-up has come up with nano-nutriceuticals using a technique in which the extract of a herb with an affinity for the nutrient extract is used to nanonise the main extract. The IP-based nanonising process has been carried out successfully for curcumin nano-nutrient.

The process has been developed by Amanchi Bala Sudhakara Sastri, chief scientific advisor at the start-up Avishkar. “Usually in regular nanonising processes such as milling, micro-fluidisation and ultra-sonication, there is a lot of true mass loss. When regular nanonising processes are used, the mass of the extract is reduced considerably, leading to extract wastage. This is not the case in the IP-method,” Sastri said.

Dinesh Reddy, MD at Avishkar said, “We are pushing strips and other products which could be used in the form of fortifiers. These products have demand in European markets and we are focusing on exports.”

Saligao: Siolim-Marna villagers came out in numbers on Sunday to send a clear message to the government that they are not interested to convert their village into an urban area.

The extraordinary gram sabha in Siolim-Marna unanimously resolved to reject the urban tag to the village.

The 13-point resolution passed at the gram sabha said the exercise to declare the village as urban was unscientific as the criteria was neither revealed nor discussed with the panchayat body and villagers.

It also said that declaring the village as urban will increase the FAR resulting in multi-storied buildings coming up thereby destroying the character of the village.

“We, the people will decide what we want or not for the village. We reject the urban status for our village,” said Amrut Agarwadekar, a villager, adding, “We will also support other 55 villages in their quest to oppose the sinister plan. If need be we will go to those villages to support them”

Mohali: The Zirakpur municipal council (MC) will start its drive to demolish 83 illegal structures along the boundary wall of the defence installation near the Chandigarh international airport from Monday.

Zirakpur MC executive officer Manvir Singh Gill said they have already made the required demarcations of the structures falling within the radius of 100 metres from the boundary wall of the defence installation to carry out the drive.

He said, “We are ready to start the drive from Monday. We are waiting for a green signal from the Mohali police for security cover to carry out the demolition.”

The administration had issued notices to the owners of the structures constructed within the radius of 100 metres from the boundary wall of the airport. District magistrate Girish Daylan on February 11 had clarified that there has been no stay either by the Supreme Court or the Punjab and Haryana high court to demolish these structures. He had directed the executive officer (EO) of the MC to carry out the demolition of the structures in compliance of the orders of the high court within two weeks. He has also questioned the executive officer that why no action taken report was submitted till date to his office. He had also issued instructions to Mohali SSP for providing security cover to the Zirakpur MC to carry out the demolition.

Earlier, notices were issued to 98 owners of illegal structures falling within the radius of 100 meters vicinity of the airport boundary wall under the Works of Defence Act, 1903, on September 18, 2019, following orders of the Punjab and Haryana high court to carry out the demolition of the structures constructed after March 9, 2011, in Bhabat village and after March 11, 2011, in Jagatpura village in the vicinity of the IAF station. All such structures were termed illegal under the Works of Defence Act, 1903.

Out of the 98, only 15 owners were able to show evidence that their structures were existing prior to March 9, 2011. All the remaining structures were raised in contravention of the Act, and are liable to be demolished, the administration had said.

Newly-appointed BJP state president K Surendran during a reception in Kozhikode on Sunday

Kozhikode: BJP state president K Surendran on Sunday alleged that the ongoing ‘ Shaheen Bagh Square ’ protest at the Kozhikode Beach was organized by extremists.

Surendran made the allegation against the Muslim Youth League (MYL)-organized agitation, which entered its 16th day on Sunday, while speaking after the reception accorded to him at Kozhikode railway station on his arrival in the city after being appointed as party president.

He said that as per his understanding, the organizers have not taken permission from Kozhikode Corporation.

“Some extremists are carrying out a venomous propaganda in the name of ‘Shaheen Bagh Square’ protest at Kozhikode Beach for the last few days. When I enquired with the corporation authorities, they have not taken any permission. The extremists are having a free run and are putting up memorials and other structures on the beach,” he said.

“Police and corporation authorities should at least look into what was going on at the protest site and asked why police were not trying to rein in those who were trying to divide people communally and to foment extremism in the society,” Surendran said.

Lashing out at chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan over the alleged corruption in the police department, Surendran said that revelations in the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) report shows that the chief minister has surpassed the previous Oommen Chandy-led UDF government in terms of corruption. Surendran said the corrupt deals in the police had taken place under the leadership of the chief minister’s office. He added that the corruption related to the deal with a tainted company is being carried out with the knowledge of Vijayan’s close relative who is in the IT business sector.

Meanwhile, MYL state general secretary P K Firos strongly condemned Surendran’s statement that extremists were behind the protest. “It is not BJP activists who were protesting in Kozhikode Beach. Surendran would have said so thinking that it was BJP workers who were carrying out the protests. It is Surendran who is heading the largest extremist organization,” he added.

KOZHIKODE: Social activist Swami Agnivesh said that Hindus in the country should realize that “narrow-minded, hate-mongering and violence-prone Hindutva is the biggest enemy of Hindu culture and society”.

Speaking at the indefinite ‘Shaheen Bagh Square’ protests, organized by the Muslim Youth League (MYL) as part of the anti-CAA protests at Kozhikode on Sunday, he said that the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) was against tradition of tolerance, which had been the hallmark of the country.

“The narrow-minded concept of Hindutva will damage our great tradition of Vedas, Upanishads and the concept of Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam. India is known for tolerance and large heartedness. We have welcomed people of all religions. CAA is going against it and we will not put up with this nonsense,” he said.

He said by trying to divide people in the name of religion, Prime Minister Narendra Modi and home minister Amit Shah were acting not only against the constitutional values, but also against the ethical and spiritual values of the country.

Agnivesh also came down heavily against the statement by BJP state president K Surendran that the ‘Shaheen Bagh Square’ was organized by extremists.

Chandigarh: Imagine a surgery is going on and welders are repairing a door of the operation theatre. This has been a reality in PGI’s trauma operation theatre complex for the past some time, according to sources. As the frame of the main door of the operation theatre had come out, welding was conducted and the surgeries continued. Also, every fortnight, the door’s frame has to be welded time and again.

Confirming that the door is old, and welding was done often, Dr Samir Aggarwal, in-charge of the trauma OT complex at PGI, said, “The operation theatres were renovated some four to five years ago. The steel door is used daily and due to the heavy load, it came out. There are five operation theatres in the complex. When the welding was being done, not all OTs were functional, as we stopped surgeries.” He said, “But it is not a day-long job and it takes hardly 10 minutes for welding.”

There are daily 25-30 elective and emergency surgeries in the OT trauma complex. “The number of surgeries in the complex has increased as one of the operation theatres (22) is being renovated. So, all surgeries which were being done there, including knee and hip replacement, or implant, are being done here,” said a technician in the OT.

The operation theatres are supposed to be sterile and closed to any dust or infection. “Not only is the welding and drilling sound disturbing, the smoke the welding produces cannot be permissible in a theatre where surgeries are on,” said a doctor in the PGI. He said, “The broken door is hardly 10metres away from the main operation hall.”

There are 56 operation theatres in PGI. In 2016, a proposal was moved by the faculty association for a modular OT as the present OT complex is some 40 years old. Official sources said earlier this proposal was not approved, but the same has been forwarded again for reconsideration.

240,['17/02/2020'],Nagpur: Coronavirus rumours bring chicken rates crashing down,"NAGPUR: Rumours regarding the global outbreak of coronavirus , which has spread from its epicentre China, has taken a huge toll on the poultry business, with farm lifting price coming down to as low as Rs30 to 45 per kg, while retail rates too have dropped to Rs74 to Rs84 per kg of live bird in Nagpur and most parts of the country.The last time chicken rates witnessed such a sharp drop was around 2006, when the avian flu scare hit the business. Producers were forced to either cull the birds or dump them.The main reason behind the impact are several social media videos and posts advising people against consuming chicken as a method of preventing the deadly coronavirus though no fatality has been reported from across the country.The industry stakeholders have been trying hard to contain the false videos, but have miserably failed to allay fears in the minds of consumers Since January 21, when first reports of coronavirus wreaking havoc in China spread, the retail chicken rates started plummeting from the high of Rs150 to Rs170.Vidarbha Poultry Farmers Association has pegged the losses at around Rs1 crore per day in Nagpur, Rs5 crore per day across Vidarbha, and Rs25 crore per day at the Maharashtra level for the last 15 days.Association president Raja Dudhbade told TOI the production cost comes to around Rs75 to 78 per one kg bird. “We already work on a marginal profit of 2 to 3 per cent.

241,['17/02/2020'],"After Amaravati fiasco, realtors bet on growth of Tadepalli, Mangalagiri","VIJAYAWADA: With the state government staying firm on three capitals formula and putting all efforts to shift executive capital to Visakhapatnam , the realty sector has become the first victim in Amaravati region.While housing projects have been stalled at places like Guntur and Amaravati capital region, office spaces are lying empty as demand has come down drastically.With more than 2 lakh sqft of office space lying vacant for the past two months in Vijayawada city alone, there are also no takers for office spaces at Tadepalli , Mangalagiri and Guntur. In fact, the latter have been the most affected areas with the capital being shifted as many projects were launched along National Highway – 16 with the hope of future development in Amaravati.Mangalagiri had shown signs of emerging as an information technology (IT) hub with some start-ups and small-scale companies starting their operations in the IT Park developed by the previous government. However, there is now no hope for growth in the future with the government’s plans to shift capital from Amaravati.Additionally, more than 50 lakh sqft of office space is likely to become vacant in and around Vijayawada if the executive capital shifted to Visakhapatnam. This would come to about 40 per cent of the total office space in Vijayawada city, which is mostly occupied by various heads of departments of the government. The Confederation of Real Estate Developers Association of India (CREDAI) Vijayawada chapter president YV Ramana Rao said that the demand for office space in Vijayawada is very low with the prevailing uncertainty. “The advantage that comes with the capital tag is completely lost now and we are waiting for the organic growth of the city to come back once the dust settles,” Rao said.On the other hand, the builders in the city are also hopeful that the sales volumes will increase in Vijayawada as the focus of investors has now shifted back from Amaravati. They also expect that the organic growth of Tadepalli and Mangalagiri will continue in the future once the air on capital shifting is cleared.Tummala Vamshi Krishna, the general secretary of Builder Association of India (BAI) Amaravati chapter observed that the natural advantage of abutting the national highway will help revive the realty sector in Tadepalli and Mangalagiri even if the executive capital is shifted to Visakhapatnam. He said if the proposed Rs 1,500 crore is sanctioned for developing both the municipalities as model municipalities, it will come as a booster shot for the realty sector in both the towns.Vamshi Krishna said the projects launched with premium pricing in Guntur, Tadepalli, Mangalagiri and Amaravati region will have to bear the brunt of capital shifting. He said people are even asking the builders to return the advance amount paid. Transactions have come to a standstill in these areas, he said, adding that the situation is only slightly different in Vijayawada. As the projects in Vijayawada were never priced too high, the projects nearing completion are witnessing some sales volumes. However, builders are wary of launching new projects even in Vijayawada with the present uncertainty.",vijayawada,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74165345,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-118937,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/after-amaravati-fiasco-realtors-bet-on-growth-of-tadepalli-mangalagiri/articleshow/74165346.cms
242,['17/02/2020'],Nagpur: Metro Reach III fails to boost Reach I ridership,"This story is from February 17, 2020

Representative Image

NAGPUR: Opening of Nagpur Metro ’s Reach III (Sitabuldi to Lokmanya Nagar) stretch was expected to increase the ridership of Reach I (Sitabuldi to Khapri) too, but a comparison of ridership figures shows that fewer passengers are using Reach I even after opening of the other stretch.

Reach III had become operational on January 28.

The average daily ridership of Reach I in December 2019 was 3,613 and revenue Rs65,085. The figures for January are 3,953 and Rs68,286. In February, so far, the average ridership is 3,773 and revenue Rs61,440.

Commenting on the slight dip in ridership of Reach I, Brijesh Dixit, managing director of MahaMetro, said, “The figures are varying every day for some reason or the other. We will wait for another 15 days before drawing any conclusion.”

As expected, ridership of Reach III is presently more than Reach I. This is true for both weekdays and weekends. For example, on February 11 the ridership of Reach I was 2,502 while that of Reach III was 3,071. On February 9, a Sunday, the corresponding figures were 7,922 and 10,046.

According to Metro officials, there are two reasons for this. The first is that people going for joyrides are going more for Reach III. Secondly, many educational institutions and Hingna MIDC are connected with this reach.

Station-wise ridership figures show that most people board Metro from Sitabuldi in both directions. In Reach I, Jai Prakash Nagar and Khapri have relatively better ridership. In Reach III, the major stations are Lokmanya Nagar and Subhash Nagar.

The ridership of Reach I had almost doubled after Jai Prakash Nagar station had opened. In spite of this, MahaMetro has been unable to start more stations. Five stations — Congress Nagar, Rahate Colony, Ajni Square, Chhatrapati Nagar and Ujjwal Nagar — are yet to become functional. Reach I had become operational in March 2019. Metro officials expect ridership to rise significantly after all the stations start.

The biggest problem for people using Metro is absence of multi-modal integration. At present only bicycles are available at Metro stations for going to nearby places. Nagpurians are not in the habit of using bicycles and only a few youngsters use them.

Metro wants to make available e-scooters at stations. However, the state transport department is yet to give permission for the same. The proposal was submitted to transport commissioner months ago. Metro officials say a green signal is expected soon.

Metro also plans to start shared e-rickshaws at Khapri station very soon. They will be launched elsewhere gradually. With the help of Nagpur Municipal Corporation , city buses are being connected to Metro stations. Bus stops are being shifted near the stations.

The approaches to Khapri and New Airport stations are, however, not proper and Metro users continue to face problems.

It is not just the slums which are apparently being ‘walled’ to hide them from the direct view of the US president. People chewing their favourite pan-masala and spewing a mouthful of ‘red liquid’ on roads or walls will have to think twice on February 24 as the AMC ostensibly doesn’t want POTUS to see this during his three-hour stay in Swachh Ahmedabad .

In its bid to keep all roads and walls around the airport spotless, the health department of the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) on Friday sealed three pan shops at the airport circle with a notice, saying that if the shopkeeper tries to remove the seal, legal actions will be taken against them.

A policeman, who was deployed at the airport circle, said that the shops were sealed after the civic body found improper disposal of garbage and spitting of pan-masala around the shops.

An AMC official of the north zone said that the customers used to throw cigarette butts and spit pan-masala everywhere, so it was difficult to keep the area clean if the shops were allowed to run.

“We have decided to seal the shops till further order,” said an AMC official. A passerby Salim Shaikh said that the shops were his favourite stop-over before going to the airport.

A policeman near the airport said that he and his other colleagues had to go to Sardarnagar to bring pan-masala as the nearby shops have been sealed.

245,['17/02/2020'],Alumni ready to help set up trauma care centre in GGH,"This story is from February 17, 2020

Guntur: Rekindling the hopes of development of a comprehensive super-specialty trauma care centre in Government General Hospital ( GGH ), Guntur Medical College Alumni Association of North America (GMCANA) has come forward to take up 50 percent of the cost. Since the new facility is expected to cost around Rs 10 crore, GMCANA said it would be happy to pool Rs 5 crore to complete the structure.

However, the association wanted the state government to spare at least Rs 2 crore in addition to the Centre’s grant of Rs.3 crore to construct two floors in one-go.

GMCANA building committee chairman Dr Babureddy Sagireddy and president Alla Srinivasa Reddy in a letter to the state government expressed their willingness to join the new venture in GGH.

They said that it has come to their notice that the government is planning to construct one floor with about 4,500 sft on the existing Podila Prasad GMCANA super-specialty block in GGH with a cost of Rs 3 crore. They noted that it would be better to go for two floors in one go as there would be lot of disruption to the ongoing services in the existing wards due to construction.

“We have planned to construct the Podila Prasad block as a G+five floor structure when it was initially proposed. However, they stopped the construction with three floors due paucity of funds and unforeseen developments,” said Dr Babureddy.

He said they were happy to share the 50 percent of the project cost if the government was willing to take up two floors with 24,000 sft each as it would create more space and more facility to poor patients.

He said disruption to existing services could be minimised by taking up construction of both floors simultaneously. “We came to know that the Centre is funding Rs 3 crore for construction of burns, plastic surgery and neurosurgery wards as trauma care centre. If the state government can release Rs 2 crore, we are ready to raise another Rs 5 crore to make the total fund Rs 10 crore and complete both the floors in one-go,” said Srinivasa Reddy.

The US-based doctors, who were old students of GMC, said the existing facility created by GMCANA has 100 percent occupancy and they would be happy to support if the state government was willing to continue the old Public-Private-Partnership (PPP) arrangement.

They said that naming rights of the blocks should rest with GMCANA as was the condition in the old PPP agreement as it would help raise funds from the alumni.

246,['17/02/2020'],BS Yediyurappa: Minister Jolle stalls promotions cleared by CM Yediyurappa,"This story is from February 17, 2020

Karnataka CM BS Yediyurappa

BENGALURU: Women and child development minister Shashikala Jolle stunned officials by freezing all promotions, including those pertaining to Group C and D employees, despite chief minister BS Yediyurappa signing off on them. Jolle has ordered the directorate to get her clearance before promoting staff in the department.

Senior department officials say as a result of the order — unprecedented in the history of the department — as many as 250 promotions to senior supervisor posts sanctioned by Yediyurappa have been put on hold.

In a letter purportedly written by Jolle on February 15, the minister said promotions to the post of senior supervisor were cleared by the directorate without her knowledge and therefore, all promotions henceforth would require her clearance. She also states she is “freezing” all promotions and postings sanctioned by the directorate.

“As per the rulebook, only promotions to Group A and B personnel (secretarial posts) are cleared by the minister, while Group C and D posts are cleared by the directorate,” an official said. “The minister’s decision means every promotion will have to be cleared by her office.”

Officials say that while her direction is related to the 250 promotions to senior supervisor level, it will have a cascading effect on supervisor posts as well, considering those 250-300 posts will also have to be filled via promotions to the junior cadre.

“Effectively, the order puts as many as 550 posts via promotions on hold,” said another official.

Asked for his reaction, KA Dayanand, director for women and child welfare department, said: “I am unaware of the letter and yet to see it. If the minister has indeed written such a letter, we will send the list to her for approval.” Jolle was unavailable for comment.

Even as the AMC continued to claim that the wall around a slum — Saraniya Vaas — near the city airport will be just 4 feet high, the wall has grown to 5 feet. Grills and curtains are being added to the top of the wall apparently to hide slums from US President Donald Trump during his visit on February 24.

A construction labourer at the site measured the wall and told TOI that it is 5 feet high at present and will get the grills and curtains over the next couple of days. When asked who ordered the increase in height, the labourer said all he knows is that he and his colleagues were told the wall should be high enough to prevent people from seeing over it. Their contractor, who was present at the spot, refused to talk.

A local resident, Mahendra Rathod, who earns his livelihood by sharpening knives, said that the construction of the wall has brought several problems.

Municipal commissioner Vijay Nehra had told TOI that a wall already stood in the area and it was dilapidated. The main reason for carrying out repair work on the wall, Nehra had said, was to ensure that it did not cause a safety problem. He also had said that he had visited the slums two months ago and had discussed a possible in situ slum upgrade with the residents.

A shopkeeper in Saraniya Vaas, Anil Sejwani, said, “I have been running this shop for a decade and it gives me decent earnings,” he said. “But the wall has affected my business.”

NAGPUR: The board exam season kicks off from Tuesday with HSC’s major exam scheduled for English subject. Though CBSE and ICSE have already started with their optional subjects, the mandatory papers will start later in the week for most.

HSC, which is always first off the block in board exams, will witness 1.68 lakh students appearing for it in Nagpur division. Board officials and principals have appealed to students to shun anxiety and ‘enjoy’ the exam period.

Ravikant Deshpande, Nagpur divisional board chairman, said, “I appeal to all students that they should be completely relaxed as the board exam starts. There is no point in getting anxious and worrying about failure as this is not the end of the road. All you must focus on is trying to solve the paper to the best of your ability. And even if things do not go as planned, remember a second chance to appear for the exam is just a few months away. As a board official, my biggest concern is that you keep yourselves calm and communicate with parents and teachers if anxious.”

Madhusudhan Mude, president of Headmasters Association, said, “There are changes to the paper pattern in English this year but students have got ample time to adapt to the same. It is common for students to feel anxiety, but as long as it gives a positive vibe, it’s fine. I always tell my students to keep talking with family and friends about everything that goes on in your mind. If you keep things inside, it will suffocate you.”

Nagpur district has the highest number of students appearing in the division with 65,484. Next in line in terms of enrolment is Chandrapur with 30,798 students followed by Gondia (21,469), Bhandara (18,464), Wardha (18,338) and Gadchiroli (13,955). This year there are 10 transgenders registered for HSC, as compared to 24 last year. The gender gap continues to follow the same pattern of previous years’ with 87,497 male and 81,001 female candidates registered for HSC.

Chandigarh: The committee constituted under the chairmanship of Justice Mehtab Singh Gill (retd) for the management of paddy straw in the state will hold its first meeting with farmers’ organisations on Tuesday.

Several peasant outfits in Punjab are at loggerheads with the government, demanding cancellation of FIRs against farmers and remission of fine imposed. Under pressure from the Supreme Court for taking action against farmers for stubble burning, the state government till November 1, 2019, had taken action against around 3,000 farmers. The enforcement agencies had imposed environment compensation amounting to Rs 41.62 lakh in 1,585 cases, red entry was made in revenue records in 1,136 cases, and FIRs filed in 202 cases against defaulting farmers.

Stubble burning has emerged as a major cause of concern for state governments and environmentalist in last couple of years. Despite making efforts, Punjab and Haryana have failed to address the problem, facing wrath of the apex court. Expressing concerns over deteriorating air quality in Delhi and the surrounding national capital region (NCR) caused by stubble burning in Punjab and Haryana, the parliamentary standing committee on agriculture in December last year had directed the department of agricultural research and education, Union ministry of agriculture and farmers welfare to chalk out concrete plans to address the problem.

Other members of the committee are secretary agriculture Kahan Singh Pannu, chairperson of Punjab Pollution Control Board S S Marwaha, representative of Punjab Agriculture University VC, ADGP intelligence nominee and representatives of farmers’ bodies.

Vijayawada: Civil supplies authorities intensified exercise on the distribution of rice cards to eligible beneficiaries across Krishna district. Ward and village secretaries went door to door to issue a newly-printed rice cards in the place of old ration card.

The YSRC government, which took charge in June 2019, has focused on streamlining ration cards. The government, which took up the ‘Navasakam’ survey, had identified that around 2 lakh ration cards across the state were obtained with fake address proofs.

Earlier, only the white ration card was considered a valid document to avail government schemes. Now, the government has introduced five different cards for the beneficiaries of seven government schemes.

After a detailed inquiry officials removed rice cards for around 2 lakh beneficiaries and replaced them with other cards based on their eligibility.

Civil supplies minister Kodali Sri Venkateswara Rao (Nani) said that the government is committed to giving ration to all eligible poor. “We have identified that many ration cardholders were not availing the ration. A few ration cardholders were using it for availing fee reimbursement, Aarogyasri, and other benefits,” he said, adding that officials will be issuing 1.29 crore rice cards in the coming five days and we will give fine quality ration soon.

Meanwhile, opposition parties are gearing up to protest along with ration cardholders who were declared ineligible.

“Around seven thousand eligible pensioners were removed in Vijayawada and only a few pensions were restored. Many of the poor were dependant on the public distribution system rice. We will take up a huge agitation if state government removes ration cards in the name of rules and regulations,” said Donepudi Shankar, CPI city secretary.

MADURAI: A pancreas transplant unit at Velammal Medical College Hospital (VMCH) in Madurai was inaugurated on Saturday, making it among the few hospitals in the state to have the facility.

“Pancreatic transplant is quite new in India and there is less awareness about it. Usually, pancreas transplant is done as a joint transplant of kidney and pancreas in a Type I Diabetes patient. The kidney and pancreas must be from the same cadaveric donor,” said Dr M Senthil, VMCH. Type 1 diabetes is a chronic disease in which cells in the pancreas that make insulin are destroyed. Such patients usually need to take insulin medication throughout their lives.

The pancreas transplant unit was inaugurated by VMCH dean Dr RM Raja Muthiah. “For the first year, the success rate of pancreas transplant is around 90% - 95%. Once the patient crosses 5-7 years, the chance of rejection is nil. The benefits of the transplant include being free from diet restriction and taking insulin medication. The risk of other diseases and complications that come with diabetics also come down over the years,” said Dr Senthil.

A continuing medical education (CME) programme for doctors was also held on pancreas transplantation.

Bengaluru: Attempts are being made to revamp the state planning board, a body which has been largely irrelevant in the 55 years since it has been in existence, on the lines of Niti Aayog , which replaced the Planning Commission at the Centre.

While the state board may not be replace by a new authority, it is considering changing its pattern of assessing the state’s development. “We are considering adopting the pattern of Niti Aayog, which follows the UN model of sustainable development goals (SDG). We intend to use the model for functionality purpose as well,” said BJ Puttaswamy, vice-chairman, planning board.

Ironically, the state has disputed SDG parameters for ranking development. Under SDG index, Karnataka’s ranking had plummeted in key areas like industry, innovation and infrastructure, education and poverty eradication.

When the rankings were released, chief secretary TM Vijay Bhaskar had written to Niti Aayog, disputing the ranking. In his letter, he said, “It is suggested that these indicators be modified to consider coverage under both central and state schemes.”

Asked if it was wise to base the state board’s development index on the same “flawed” SDG model, Puttaswamy said: “I agree there are minor issues in one or two cases. We have written to the Centre and we are awaiting a response.”

Meanwhile, the planning board will induct new members taking its tally to anywhere between 10 and 18. Puttaswamy said the board will urge the chairman — chief minister BS Yediyurappa — to induct only subject experts and refrain from inducting political appointees.

“Our recommendation to the CM is to induct vice-chancellors of agriculture universities to deal with agriculture and horticulture issues, experts on groundwater recharge and traffic management and urban planners,” Puttaswamy said.

PANAJI: Schools will be observing International Mother Tongue Day, celebrated as ‘matribhasha diwas’ in India, on February 21.

Among the programmes to be carried out in schools is reading of the preamble of the Constitution of India in the mother tongue, as has been suggested to schools by the directorate of education in a circular.

“Unesco has declared February 21 as International Mother Tongue Day to promote the dissemination of mother tongue and awareness of linguistic and cultural traditions throughout the world and to inspire solidarity based on understanding, tolerance and dialogue. It has been decided to celebrate ‘matribhasha diwas’ on February 21 to promote the use of mother tongue. This day should be conducted in all schools and at the state and district level,” director of education Vandana Rao has said in a circular.

She said that the programmes should highlight linguistic diversity of the country; encourage usage, not only of the mother tongue, but other Indian languages; to draw attention to the diversity in scripts; and to encourage learning of other languages.

“In case schools are closed on February 21, on account of examinations, Mahashivratri, etc, the day should be celebrated on February 20,” Rao said.

The directorate has suggested that besides reading of the preamble of the Constitution in ‘matribasha’, schools can hold essay competitions and debates, an exhibition of Indian languages through display boards, conduct general knowledge quizzes on Indian language heritage, singing of group folk songs.

Schools have been told to submit a report of the activities held to observe the day to the directorate by end of February.

261,['17/02/2020'],Nagpur: Minor played key role in gang that targeted wedding venues,"This story is from February 17, 2020

NAGPUR: Four members of the Madhya Pradesh-based gang from the Sisodiya community of Pachod in Rajgarh district, including a woman and a 14-year-old minor, were netted from Tajbagh for their alleged involvement in series of thefts at marriage venues in the city in the last one year.

The gang, which used the nattily dressed minor for thefts to avoid suspicion, is likely to be slapped with the Juvenile Justice Act as well. This is for the first time that such a gang was nabbed in the city which targeted only marriage venues.

Unit No. 5 of the crime branch recovered valuables worth Rs5.14 lakh from the gang, including the ones stolen from an upmarket hotel in Ramdaspeth on February 9, the marriage ceremony day of the Ganeriwal family. While Sunny Chayal (32), Mohit Mahendrasingh (26) and Bambabai Sisodiya (45) were arrested from a room rented by the gang, the minor, too, was rounded up from the same place.

Five offences of last year and two from the current year were detected. Offences registered at Lakadganj, Kalamna, Gittikhadan and Sitabuldi police stations were cracked.

Addl CP (crime) Nilesh Bharne, who was flanked by ACP Kishor Jadhav and PI Vinod Patil, said the minor, dressed in a blazer, played a key role in the thefts. “The CCTV footage showed the involvement of a minor in a theft at Rajwada Palace. The minor would pick a spot close to the dais where the newly-wed couple was busy accepting wishes of guests. The attention of the minor would be fixed on valuables, especially the bag containing envelopes with cash,” he said.

Bharne also said that the gang may have targeted wedding venues in different cities, including Thane, Mumbai and places outside Maharashtra. “The gang members posed as guests. They dressed for the occasion with male members in blazers. We have recovered blazers of different sizes and colours from their den,” said Bharne.

The gang would travel to their destination by bus or train and would never return to the targeted place again.

Bharne extolled the efforts of the team under APIs Anil Meshram and Amol Kachore comprising head constables Umesh Khobragade, Tulsi Shukla, Sunil Choudhary, Naik police constables Sunil Thaokar, Dinesh Chafelkar, Anil Bawane and others. “The gang was nabbed with the help of CCTV footage. The minor would steal valuables and pass it on to another member who in turn would hand it over to one more member who would flee in an autorickshaw,” said Bharne.

AHMEDABAD: A major plan to spruce up the area around Motera cricket stadium will be undertaken after US President Donald Trump and Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s visit on February 24. A special exercise of chalking a local area plan (LAP) for the stadium and surrounding precincts will be undertaken.

The Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) has already given 16 stretches of road around the stadium a makeover, as well as laying new alternative routes to the world’s largest cricket stadium.

There are six large slum clusters around the stadium which may be considered under an in situ social housing scheme. Sources at the civic body said that a detailed survey of underground lines is also being done simultaneously, to clear blockages or shift lines.

Some of the main roads that have been widened and resurfaced include Chimanbhai Patel Bridge to Visat junction and Visat to Zundal Junction. Another stretch that has been repaired include the stretch between Visat Junction and Tapovan Circle.

The access road to the Motera stadium from Janpath Hotel has been widened to 24 metres, along with two other parallel roads. Two new roads have been made, from Bhat and Koteshwar to Motera.

264,['17/02/2020'],Maharshtra: Tukaram Mundhe plan for NMC budget will clip office bearers’ wings,"This story is from February 17, 2020

Representative Image

NAGPUR: Municipal commissioner Tukaram Mundhe has revised the system of making budget for NMC to bring it in line with Maharashtra Municipal Corporations (MMC) Act. He plans to include all works to be executed in entire financial year in the budget itself at the beginning of the particular fiscal year.

The objectives are to take up priority works, bring in transparency, cut short administrative process, and match expenditure with income. The move is likely to put an end to discretionary powers of office bearers in distributing funds and allegations of opposition corporators about getting unfair treatment.

Except in 2006-07 and 2007-08, NMC has been listing only big projects in the budget and funds allocated for them in the budget. For the rest, general provisions were made without mentioning specific works. For example, budget allocates Rs 70 crore for tar road works but fails to mention which roads will be taken up. After approving the budget, general body empowers standing committee chairman to decide which roads will be repaired.

The departments have to seek a letter from chairman before preparing any proposal. They then put up proposal seeking administrative approval and complete tendering process and again seek approval for work order. At every step, civic chief’s approval is also required.

NMC sources told TOI, Mundhe asked the officials to prepare his budget mentioning all works. This has delayed the budget beyond Feb 15 deadlines in MMC Act.

BJP corporator Dayashankar Tiwari opposed the move saying NMC’s revenue was uncertain so works cannot be decided in advance. “Existing system enables NMC to propose works as per requirements and situation in prevailing conditions. NMC officials and engineers have no idea about problems at ground level so it is not possible to include all works in the budget itself. Civic chief has been given powers to revise budget in January as per estimated income. There is no need to revise existing system,” he said.

Congress corporator Sandip Sahare however said revision will ensure unbiased distribution of funds and priority to required works. “Also, works will be speeded up with more transparency. It will prevent overlapping of works, wastage of public money and unnecessary inflating the budget. The system should be implemented in distribution of funds for Backward Class head. Funds meant for Backward Class are being spent in unqualified areas by ruling party,” he said.

Independent corporator Abha Pande said existing system should continue. “Corporators will lose say in proposing works under new system. Officials are unaware of problems at ground level. If Mundhe wishes to revise the system, he should hold meetings with officials and corporators and prepare the list before budget,” she said.

Shiv Sena corporator Kishor Kumeriya said Mundhe’s plan was proper but some funds should be reserved for emergency works. “General body is decision making authority in the NMC so each and every work should be approved by general body which will be ensured in new system,” he said.

PANAJI: If pet shops and dog breeders do not register with the Goa State Animal Welfare Board within 30 days, the state government will act against them as per rules.

Based on a statement of advocate general Devidas Pangam, the high court of Bombay at Goa disposed of a public interest litigation, seeking implementation of the provisions of the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act, 1960, and the rules made thereunder.

The first grievance relates to the establishment of societies for the prevention of cruelty to animals (SPCAs) in North and South Goa districts.

Dhaval Zaveri, advocate for petitioner Kabir Gama-Roy, who is an animal activist pointed out that rule 3 of the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (Establishment and Regulation of Societies for Prevention of Cruelty to Animals) Rules, 2001, amended the establishment of such societies by the state government.

The advocate general submitted that within three months, the SPCAs will be established for both the districts. “This statement is accepted, and according to us this substantially redresses the first grievance of the petitioner,” observed a division bench comprising justices M S Sonak and M S Jawalkar.

Zaveri said that there are many pet shops and dog breeders functioning without registration which is mandatory under such rules.

Pangam said that pet shops and dog breeders will have to complete their registration by paying fees of Rs 5,000 and the same will be valid for two years in case of breeders and five years for shops.

Since the authorities numbered the pillars of metro rail construction, they have become easy landmarks helping to locate addresses — whether shops, offices or residences. In parts of the city where pillars have been erected, people have begun identifying their location by the metro pillar number close to their house or shop.

Many people have begun mentioning their closest metro pillar number in addresses that they provide for making official documents like PAN card, driving license, aadhaar and the like.

“People who visit from other parts of the city find it difficult to locate a particular address on the stretch between Vastral Ring Road and Apparel Park. When a particular pillar number is specified, they can reach the spot without asking for directions,” said Pratik Patel, who runs a computer peripherals shop near Vastral. Many people also prefer to mention the number of a metro pillar when they want to meet someone at a rendezvous.

Samant can mass produce cabbage and harvest five-six tonnes a day

PANAJI: After mining came to a grinding halt in Dharbandora , Varad Samant did not lose hope but turned to Mother Earth to get him out of a tight spot. Today his locally-grown cabbage has been accepted by the Goa State Horticulture Corporation Limited (GSHCL) which will market his produce at outlets across the state.

Samant has been able to successfully harvest vegetables at his farm. “The farm is surrounded by a mining area. The land was cultivable even then, but we couldn’t access the farm due to movement of mining trucks. After the closure of mining in 2012, my family decided to take up cultivation of the land on a large scale, full-time,” Samant told TOI.

Samant’s father started with sugarcane farming in 2012 but that did not take off. In 2015, he ventured into growing lady’s finger and other vegetables which turned out a success. “In November 2019, we decided to try out cabbage and that crop grew very well,” he said.

With this Samant is able to mass produce the crop and harvest about five-six tonne of cabbage per day. “His expected yield is 60 tonne this season,” said GSHCL managing director Sandeep Faldesai, adding, “While Goa sources most of its vegetables from neighbouring states, receiving an assured price may potentially motivate local farmers to take up agriculture.”

“If local farmers mass produce vegetables like these, Goa can become self-sufficient in items that are feasible for cultivation in Goa,” he said. Samant also planted carrot and chilli among other vegetables at his farm. There is a constant check on the growth of these crops, use of organic pesticide and fencing of the perimeter to ensure that there is a healthy produce.

“We have taken the responsibility to ensure that Samant doesn’t face any issues with marketing. He has the full support from the corporation to grow the indigenous variants of cabbage,” Faldesai said.

NAGPUR: Apart from diabetes, hypertension and asthma, sedentary lifestyle has also brought modern musculoskeletal problems like knee pain, back pain, neck pain, slip disc and sciatica .

Conventional approach to solve orthopaedic problems like having painkillers and other medicines, physiotherapy, and performing surgeries is not successful in case of these modern orthopaedic problems, said internationally renowned Indian orthopaedic surgeon Padma Shri Dr John Ebnezar.

“A combination of modern medicines and ancient yoga is the only solution that brings complete and long-term cure as far as modern orthopaedic problems are concerned. Young professionals should adopt yoga to maintain their physical, mental, emotional as well as spiritual well-being,” he said.

Dr Ebnezar is a trauma specialist, spine surgeon and strongly believes in superiority of modern medical science. However, while finding solutions on orthopaedic problems faced by working professionals at comparatively younger age, he realized that the root cause of these problems is in stress.

“Problems like slip disc, neck and knee pain are common in young professionals these days. Modern approach does not address the problem in its entirety and is only symptomatic. So, pain comes back even after long-term medication and surgeries. Wholistic therapy is non-operative, low cost and very effective for such patients,” he said.

After years of research, Dr Ebnezar has introduced concept of ‘Wholistic Orthopaedics-When East Meets West’ which was accepted by many international bodies including American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (AAOS). Since 2013, yoga is recommended in the Knee guidelines of AAOS.

Dr Ebnezar was in the city to attend ‘knee for all’ summit organized by Academy of Medical Sciences (AMS) and Association of physicians of India’s Vidarbha Chapter. He not only addressed doctors about the changed protocol of knee treatment, but also conducted an open forum for common people in which he answered many questions.

Convener of the event Dr RM Chandak spoke about diet. He advised youngsters to avoid fast food as it leads to weight gain that eventually results in knee pain. Dr Sharad Deshmukh said that self-medication and taking painkillers without doctors’ advice may increase stress on kidneys.

NAGPUR: The love and curiosity for learning foreign languages is creating buzz in the city, apart from the popularity of Spanish and French . People are following the trend of ‘K-POP’ culture and are participating in Korean language workshops which are conducted by young tutors in the city. These workshops are conducted under the banner of ‘Culture Fluent’, a foreign language workshop station, started by a young girl, Devyani Jaiswal.

Devyani started learning French after Std 10. At that time there were no schools offering French or any other foreign language. “I was lucky to find an amazing tutor who turned my hobby into a passion. Today I hold the upper-intermediate DELF B2 (Diplôme d'études en langue française) Diploma in French Language Studies ,” she said.

Rebecca Peter, who is a self-taught Korean language tutor, learnt the alphabets, vocabulary and grammar from the Internet. She was fascinated by the Korean culture which came from the trend of Gangnam Style dance video, BTS Army, a popular Korean Band etc, “Korean culture is unique and the most popular reason for many youngsters to learn the language, they are driven by the authenticity of their culture,” she said.

Devyani organized various language appreciation workshops, which were a first for the city. “In all our workshops we have discussions about culture and traditions and language focused activities so people get an idea of what to expect when they do start learning formally,” she said.

Many students in the ages of 16-23 are taking up languages as a way of broadening their horizons and enhancing their skills. So young tutors provide a sense of comfort and bonhomie, the channels get opened for conversations. People are choosing these young tutors because there is free conversation among the tutor and student, and the learning gets enriched.

Gowrie Maiya, a medicine student shared her experience of understanding Korean culture, through the medium of language, “In these workshops, we were not only taught about the language but we discussed various subjects such as culture, grammar, fashion and the trends, which made it a fun-learning experience for everyone.”

According Tezobala Marisetti, an aeronautical engineer, drive of learning new things and exploring different cultures brought him to attend the Korean language workshop, “I love exploring about new things and if we learn things from someone young tutors, the class becomes very lively and happening.”

Atharva Menghal, a student and avid French language learner said, “I started developing interest after watching a Netflix series and wanted someone young and spontaneous to teach me the language hence I am studying French with Devyani.”

Maria George, a software engineer who is learning French with Devyani also has a keen interest in Korean language, “I love everything about the Korean culture, and I had to explore its language part. Hence I started attending the language workshops.”

Roshni John, IT firm employee who is a big ‘K-Pop’ fan said, “I had great sense of fascination towards Korean Culture and chose to learn the language from Rebecca. I attended the workshops and learning with someone from your age makes the whole difference,” she said.

In 2015 when US secretary of state John Kerry was on his way back to the airport after attending the inaugural function of the Vibrant Gujarat Global Business Summit in Gandhinagar, his cavalcade had hit a mongrel that had strayed into the path near SVP airport. To avoid such embarrassments, the cattle menace department will hold a special meeting on Monday to capture dogs and keep them away from the VVIP route for almost five days till US President and the delegation leave the city.

The airport area and the 1km radius around Motera stadium towards Koteshwar and Bhatt village is known for ‘nilgai’ or blue bull intrusions. The forest department is being consulted on the issue also.

The cattle and dog nuisance control department (CDNCD) of the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) on the other hand will constitute a special team to capture dogs within at least 2.75km radius of the VIP route.

“There is a Supreme Court direction and guidelines of the Animal Welfare Board (AWB) of India that mandates that dogs once neutered should be put back at the same location as they tend to get aggressive when relocated to a new place,” says a senior CDNCD official at the AMC.

The AMC official admitted that the dog menace wing of the CDNCD has already spotted the areas from where the dogs need to be picked up and neutered. “There are societies and chawls in Sabarmati area which feed stray dogs and that may be a problem. These societies will be approached by the Sabarmati ward AMC officers in the coming days to desist from feeding the dogs,” adds the AMC official.

DEHRADUN: Haridwar district president of Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) Hema Bhandari announced the party’s support to seer Padmavati , who has been fasting for the cause of clean and free-flowing Ganga at Haridwar for several weeks now.

Bhandari, who had gone to meet the seer on Sunday, said, “Her meditation is not for personal gain but for the entire humanity. AAP stands by people who are fighting for social causes and we will provide them all possible support. The seer has completed 65 days of fasting at the Haridwar-based Matri Sadan ashram.

Meanwhile, the head of Matri Sadan Shivanand Saraswati alleged that state government is again plotting to forcibly lift the fasting seer.

He said, “Despite Padmavati’s repeated requests, doctors, whom she doesn’t trust, are visiting Matri Sadan and asking her to end her fast. They don’t understand that there is no such law in the country’s constitution that can stop a seer from meditating.”

The seer added that neither the Centre nor the state government has responded to any of their communication so far. “Nearly a week ago, Padmavati had sought action against a Union minister and six others for trying to silence the ashram’s movement but even now she has received no response,” the seer said.

AHMEDABAD: Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh chief Mohan Bhagwat said in Ahmedabad on Sunday that cases of divorce were more prevalent in educated and affluent families as education and affluence have brought in arrogance which causes families to split. Bhagwat was addressing RSS workers and their families.

“The prevalence of divorce cases has increased considerably nowadays and people fight over trivial matters. Cases of divorce are more in educated and affluent families because education and affluence are accompanied by arrogance. Families fall apart and the society also falls apart,” Bhagwat was quoted in a release issued by the RSS.

Mohan Bhagwat said that he expected RSS volunteers to tell their families about the activities of the Sangh, because women members of the family are involved in far more arduous work than RSS volunteers. He said confining women to homes has resulted in the condition of the society that we see today. “For the past 2,000 years or so, the society has been confining women to homes. This was not the case 2,000 years ago. That was the golden period of our society,” the statement quoted the RSS chief saying.

Stressing on the importance of women in society, Bhagwat said, “Hindu society should be virtuous and organised, and society is not only about men. `Matru Shakti’ comprises half of our society and we should strengthen the women of our society.”

Ajmer: The administration has suspended sub-divisional officer Anju Sharma and SHO Sunil Beda of Roopangarh town of the district.

Police have also registered a case against officials of the finance firm that had locked a house with a nine-month-old baby girl inside in order to recover dues. The district collector has also initiated an inquiry in the matter.

The matter was taken up in the state assembly on Friday by BJP MLA from Pushkar, Suresh Rawat. He said that the firm had seized a house with a nine-month-old infant inside.

The parents pleaded to let them take the child but their pleas fell on deaf ears. According to MLA Rawat, Om Prakash Kumawat in Kasya ki Dhani village of Roopangarh, was unable to repay the loan that he had taken. On Thursday finance company representatives along with government officials sealed the house and its main gate. Om Prakash’s wife shouted that her daughter was inside but they did not listen. SDO Anju Sharma and SHO Sunil Beda were also present, however they did not pay heed to the couple’s pleas. Later in the evening the couple broke the lock and brought out the child. The matter was raised by the local MLA.

Additional SP (rural) Kishan Singh Bhati on Saturday went to Roopangarh. A case was registered against the finance firm.

The Rs 18-crore Marcel bus stand was inaugurated on June 2, 2019

PANAJI: The directorate of transport is in the process of handing over the bus stand at Marcel to the Kadamba transport corporation (KTC).

“The file is moving out to go for the final concurrence of the finance department and the law department. Thereafter, the transport department is going to enter into a lease agreement with KTC,” a transport official told TOI.

The Rs 18-crore KTC bus stand at Marcel, Ponda, which was lying unused for almost two years, was inaugurated on June 2, 2019. While both KTC and private buses operate from this terminus, the complex hadn’t been handed over to KTC owing to various issues.

Among the prominent problems was that of the exit gate; buses were not being allowed to leave from here after business establishments along the road adjoining it objected. The buses therefore entered and exited from the main gate itself.

“Owing to these issues at the Marcel bus stand , the handingover was pending. Now it should move quickly. No sooner are the formalities completed, it can go to KTC, hopefully, by the end of this month,” the official said.

The directorate of transport is also in the process of taking over the new bus stand at Pernem from the GSIDC. Sources said that the new terminus at Pernem was pending completion of works by the GSIDC.

“There is still a little work pending at the Pernem bus stand part which is why we have not taken over it yet. Our officer there is reluctant to take permission until the GSIDC finishes all the work,” the official said.

GSIDC managing director Srinet Kotwale said that all the works that were decided for the project have already been completed, and the bus stand was handed over to the transport department. It was inaugurated on August 15, 2018.

“If there is additional work to be done, the department must submit a proposal for additional work. We will do those works as per due process,” he said.

RTO Dinesh Chandra Pathoi told TOI that the transport department had already informed the city police about the insurance fraud in December last year.

“We found out about the insurance fraud and reported it at the Hathibarkala police station. Had police acted promptly on our complaint, the culprits would have been behind bars today,” said Pathoi.

Bengaluru: Embroiled in the controversy over being minister for forests despite facing several cases under the Forest Act, Anand Singh has quietly pushed the issue of turning Vijayanagara, currently part of Ballari, into a new district on the backburner.

Singh had mooted the idea of carving Vijayanagara district out of Ballari and even made it his poll plank in the 2018 elections, when he contested on a Congress ticket, and the 2019 byelections when he contested on a BJP ticket after being disqualified for resigning from the assembly and switching to the saffron party.

Now, his silence on the proposal of a new district is deafening and indications are the government has shelved the issue, at least for now.

“The chief minister is burdened with so many issues,” Singh told TOI. “I don’t want to trouble him further by pushing the proposal of a new Viajayanagara district especially given the turbulent political situation.” He admitted he did not broach the issue when he met Yediyurappa last Friday.

Reports suggest Singh, who was originally allocated food and civil supplies, was handed forests after demanding chief minister BS Yediyurappa change his portfolio. He met Yediyurappa on Friday and reportedly sought another change.

The BJP admitted it is in no position to divide Ballari — at least now — and also indicated Singh will continue as forest minister . “There is neither a possibility of creating a new district by dividing Ballari nor changing Anand Singh’s portfolio, at least in the near future,” said N Ravikumar, BJP state general secretary and MLC, who was in-charge of the campaign in Vijayanagara during the bypolls.

Turbulence in Ballari politics and conflict within the party over Singh’s induction into the cabinet appears to have forced Yediyurappa’s hand.

“We never wanted Ballari to be bifurcated,” said Ballari (City) legislator G Somashekar Reddy. “Some people with vested interests tried pressuring the CM, but we asked him not to buckle. We are happy Yediyurappa has decided not to pursue the matter.”

Indian Institute of Petroleum and Energy

VISAKHAPATNAM: The first batch of students at Indian Institute of Petroleum and Energy ( IIPE ) are worried about their career prospects with only two recruiters--HPCL and Infosys—holding campus interviews so far.

The first batch has 100 students and only six have been picked up by the two companies.

IIPE began with two undergraduate programmes in 2016-17 with a mix of students from nearly 20 states. Admission to IIPE is based on JEE (Advanced) scores.

The Union government sanctioned IIPE to Andhra Pradesh as promised under the 13 Schedule of the AP Reorganisation Act, 2014. Subsequently, IIPE got ‘Institute of National Importance’ tag at par with IITs and IIMs as enacted by Parliament through the Indian Institute of Petroleum & Energy Act, 2017.

IIPE is an autonomous institute under the ministry of petroleum & natural gas and backed by public sector oil and gas giants such as HPCL, IOCL, ONGC, GAIL and OIL, whose CEOs are on the Board of IIPE.

A few students told TOI that several public oil and gas majors have visited private institutions for campus placements but not IIPE.

“For reasons unknown, even private organisations have not made their presence felt at IIPE. We are worried over poor placements as we have invested time and money. The perceived advantages of studying in a national institute like IIPE will vanish once we leave the campus. We have met Vice-President M Venkaiah Naidu during his recent visit to the city and brought the issue to his notice. We also discussed it with K Haribabu, former MP from Visakhapatnam . All premier institutions in the country have concluded their campus placements, while IIPE is still struggling to to initiate the placement season,”said the students.

Prof VSRK Prasad, director, IIPE, said IIPE has been pursuing the recruitment issue with the Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas. “We have invited nearly 200 private organisations for campus placements. GAIL has promised a campus recruitment drive. We have also been pursuing it with ONGC and IOCL. Hopefully, we will get all these recruiters on board,” said Prasad.

In most cases, the accused persons showed fake ID cards to procure payment even before buyers received the items,” said a cyber crime police officer.In November last year, a 40-year-old businessman from Secunderabad lost Rs 20,000 due to a fake OLX advertisement.

Jodhpur: High court has issued notices to the state government and commercial tax department, seeking reply in four weeks on the notice issued by the anti-evasion wing of the department, while allowing a petition challenging the notice issued by the tax department levying entry tax on the imported goods from outside the country, despite the matter having been pending before the high court.

Single bench of justice Arun Bhansali also stayed the effect and operation of the notice admitting the argument of the petitioner’s counsel that the notice issued by the anti-evasion wing of the department was illegal as the matter pertaining to validity of the Rajasthan Tax on Entry of Goods into Local Areas Act, 1999 has been pending for adjudication before the division bench of the high court.

Petitioner JK Cement Ltd. was issued show cause notice on January 24 for levy of tax, interest and penalty for the assessment year 2013-14.

“This notice was not only issued with the matter pending before the high court but also after the expiry of the period prescribed in the law. The department by its notice has reopened the previously closed assessment year of 2013-2014 by giving notice for escapement of tax under Entry Tax Act of 1999,” said the counsel Ramit Mehta.

“It was in spite of the admission by the department itself before the high court that it was not levying tax on the goods imported from outside the country,” said Mehta adding that the notice has been issued in contravention of its own admission by the department.

He said that it was for the first time since the introduction of the Entry Tax Act 1999, that the state has issued notice in 2020 for levying entry tax on imported goods along with interest and penalty for the assessment year 2013-14.

These videos have severely impacted the non-veg markets in the city.Mahanti Market, One Town market, Chuttugunta market and other non-vegetarian markets across the city wore a deserted look on Sunday. “Our sales have been down for about two weeks now. Residents are hesitating to buy chicken due to the fear of COVID-19 and bird flu. Sale of mutton and seafood have also come down. The state government should give clarity on the rumours being spread on social media,” said Sk Basha, a chicken trader from Chuttugunta.Poultry farmers across Krishna and West Godavari districts are in a hurry to clear their stocks. In some areas, the live bird is being sold for Rs 50 per kilogram, due to a fear of the bird having a bird flu type of viral infection. “Rumours about bird flu destroyed the market.

Hyderabad: For the first time in 30 years, the Telangana government is planning to introduce skill-based courses — accounting and taxation, automobile engineering technician, tourism and hospitality management, commercial garment technology, physiotherapy, among others at undergraduate level in degree colleges across the state.

A proposal to introduce 22 courses has been sent by Telangana State Board of Intermediate Education (TSBIE) commissioner to special chief secretary of education and Telangana State Council of Higher Education (TSCHE).

“Starting vocational or skill-based courses at degree level will convert our state into a hub of industrial development,” said Syed Omer Jaleel, TSBIE commissioner, adding that currently 96,000 students are pursuing intermediate vocational courses in the state and they do not have the opportunity to continue their studies in the same subject at undergraduate level.

Jaleel said students who finished their intermediate in vocational courses are currently eligible to pursue only BA or BCom. “If any student wants to pursue BSc or BTech, they have to appear and clear a bridge course. Even after clearing the bridge course, they are forced to take some irrelevant courses as that particular stream is not available in degree colleges. Say, a student who has finished inter in medical lab technician or livestock management and dairy technology is forced to pursue BSc. What is the point of specialising in a course in inter, only to study it as a subject or just a topic in degree?” Jaleel said.

The officials of State Institute of Vocational Education (SIVE) said that introducing skill-based courses will not only help inter vocational students, but will also be helpful for class 12 students as they will have an opportunity to follow their career path. They added that it would be better if these courses are not called Bachelor of Vocation as it would give the impression that these are alien courses.

“These courses should be offered just like any other course. Naming the courses as Bachelor in Fisheries or Bachelor in Tourism and Hospitality Management or Bachelors in Retail Management will help students and parents relate with these courses,” said Raja Shekar, academic guidance officer, SIVE.

Officials of collegiate education confirmed that they are looking to introduce these courses at undergraduate level from upcoming academic year. “Last year, we were looking at vocational courses at inter level and noticed that there is no clear path for students. We have been working on this and will have a clear picture within a week or two,” said Navin Mittal, commissioner, collegiate education.

TSCHE chairman T Papi Reddy also confirmed that they have received a proposal from TSBIE and social welfare residential educational institutions about skill-based courses at degree level and they are working out a plan to introduce these courses.

At present, 22 vocational courses are offered at 176 junior colleges across the state. These courses are expected to be introduced in degree colleges which are near to the said inter colleges.

AMARAVATI: The embattled TDP leadership heaved a sigh of relief after seeing the Income Tax (IT) department’s panchanama report (statement of preliminary inquiry) regarding raids at the house of Pendyala Srinivas, former personal secretary to TDP president Chandrababu Naidu .

According to the report, only Rs 2.63 lakh in cash and some jewellery were seized during the raids in Vijayawada. TDP slammed YSRC for spreading false information campaign against Naidu.

On Sunday, TDP fielded almost all former ministers and former legislators to slam the YSRC campaign that Naidu’s aide was involved in Rs 2,000 crore scandal.

“YSRC has launched a smear campaign against Chandrababu Naidu and Lokesh despite they having no role in recent IT raids. The I-T department could find only Rs 2.6 lakh cash with Srinivas,” said former minister Yanamala Ramakrishnudu. He said YSRC made Rs 2.6 lakh into Rs 2,000 crore as Vijayasai Reddy, Jagan’s confidant, was known for changing numbers as an auditor. He said TDP is contemplating legal recourse as YSRC and its media houses resorted to mudslinging against Naidu and his family.

Speaking to media on Sunday, TDP senior legislator Gorantla Buchaiah Chowdary said Interpol would shortly nab chief minister Jaganmohan Reddy for charges pending against him in international courts.

He said Jagan failed to bring even a single rupee from the Centre in the last seven months as he was only concentrating on getting freedom from the cases. Former ministers Kalava Srinivasulu, Alapati Rajendraprasad and Kollu Ravindra said YSRC launched a campaign on IT raids to divert people’s attention.

BJP MLC Somu Veerraju said TDP has nothing to cheer about the panchanama report as it was only a seizure report while the scam is yet to come out. He said the I-T had said it unearthed Rs 2,000 crore black money and round-tripping of money to evade taxes.

Pune: Residents of Kharadi were up in arms against the local traders on Sunday for permitting a weekly farmers’ market on an open plot on Dargah Road, stating that they had demanded it to be developed into a play area and a garden.

The inauguration of the farmers’ market was scheduled on Sunday evening and flex banners were put up in and around the area. However, the Hindraj Agro Industries Farmer Producer Company, which had organized the weekly market, called off the inauguration citing the protest.

Around five societies in the vicinity had opposed the marked.

The residents also staged a peaceful protest at the plot raising their opposition on Sunday. Social activist Prabha Bagalkotkar said, “The residents have been demanding the space to be utilized to provide amenities such as an oxygen garden and a play area so that they are benefited. We do not require the weekly vegetable market here as there is a huge market in Chandannagar.”

The residents of Cheryl Apartments, Beryl Apartments, Langston Society, Zinia, Aleria and City Vista societies opposed the weekly farmers’ market. Nitin Karodade, the chairman of Cheryl Apartments, said, “The open space is allocated to the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) as amenity space, marked as an exhibition ground in the draft development plan. This space has been lying vacant for a long time and is often misused for dumping garbage and construction material. This weekly market plan was not required.”

Mukesh Mehere, a member of Hindraj Agro Industries Farmer Producer Company, said, “We did not know the exact process of taking permission to set up the market. Although, we had spoken to the local corporator in the area about it and he had given us a nod. Based on this, we organized the market. But, we cancelled our plans because of the agitation by residents.”

The local NCP corporator Mahendra Pathare said he was unaware of the issue the entire day.

“Around 4.30pm, I got to know about it and I decided to visit the place. But, I did not get a call from any of the parties involved so I didn’t go. I will speak to all the stakeholders and find a middle ground,” he said.

Pune: Two teams from Victorious Kidss Educares (VKE) have cruised into the national finals of Formula One (F1) in Schools after winning awards in the Western India Regional Championship held recently in Mumbai.

Team Black Hawks and Team Korinis of Victorious Kidss Educares have been selected for the nationals to be held in Delhi in April, a statement issued by the school said.

F1 in Schools is an international science, technology, engineering, mathematics (STEM) competition for school children (aged 9–19), in which groups of 3 to 6 students have to design and manufacture a miniature car out of the official F1 Model Block using CAD/CAM design tools.

The students who participated through the four teams included Aryaman Roongta, Rudraaunsh Pandhe, Shabbir Koser, Rajveer Ratnam, Naisha Deshpande, Rohan Basava, Roniet Shende, Shiksha Mohan, Sweekriti Gupta, Arjun Patil, Dia Gerwal, Pratham Pandey, Aryan Gandhi, Raahil Vasa, Devvik Agarwal, Aadi Karnavat, Anagh Tanwar, Caitlyn Pereira and Ojas Chandegave.

Rudraaunsh Pandhe's achievement stood out as he broke the world’s best reaction time record by .002 second. The earlier visual record was 0.120 seconds in the F1 in Schools competition. Rudraaunsh scored 0.118 seconds.

VKE students were grouped into four teams — Black Hawks, Lightning Pacers, Oscars and Koronis, to take part in the competition. “The training started on the school campus in November 2019. Keeping in mind the requirement and peculiar outlines of the competition, we had meticulously designed the aerodynamic F1 car,” Pandhe said

The miniature air-powered F1 car is designed using Autodesk Fusion 360 software which was later tested in software in the school itself.

Through this competition, the students learned to make a business plan, manage budgets, and raise sponsorships to fund their research, travel and accommodation. These miniature cars were then pitted against each other in a 24-metre track to determine the fastest one.

“The competition considered all-round performance among other aspects to judge the winners. Each team was assigned with separate roles such as team manager, designer, graphic designer, manufacturing manager and marketing manager, among others, to support the teams,” president of VKE Robbin Ghosh said.

The participants were monitored by Vishal Dutta and Jyoti Bahl and were coordinated by Irfan Sheikh. They helped the students in their orientation and design, the statement added.

301,['17/02/2020'],Hadapsar waste mgmt plant to start in March,"This story is from February 17, 2020

Pune: The new waste management plant set up by the Pune Cantonment Board (PCB) in the Hadapsar industrial area is expected to become operational by the first week of March.

Currently, the board dumps wet and dry garbage in an open area in the industrial belt which has led to health issues in the surrounding areas.

A group of citizens and activists had filed a petition against the board in the Bombay High court, which directed the cantonment board to set up the plant to resolve the issue.

“We had awarded the contract to a private agency, which was unable to finish the work within the deadline. So, we had to float a new tender and rope in a new agency which took a few weeks. Prolonged monsoon last year also hampered the progress of the project,” said PCB chief executive officer Amit Kumar.

“Now, the work is in the final stages. The appointed agency will set up the machine in the last week of February and the plant will start functioning from next month,” he added.

Kumar said that the new facility will process 100 tonnes of garbage daily. “Our daily collection is around 40 to 50 tonnes, but the plant has been set up considering the future needs,” Kumar said. The plant would not only produce compost but also convert non-recyclable dry waste into refuse derived fuel (RDF).

“The bidder will establish the facility and run it for 15 years,” said Kumar, adding that, the agency will have to adhere to the terms and conditions in the contract to meet the current and future requirements.

There are two trenching grounds in the Hadapsar industrial area which have been used as ‘dumping grounds’ by the board for the last few years. At one ground, the board has set up vermicompost plant, while the other was kept open till 2017.

The board started scientific capping after residents and industries lodged complaints. “We have done capping of maximum area. Only garbage generated a year ago remains in the open area which will be capped and processed in the weeks to come,” Kumar said.

Agra: Large number of students of Aligarh Muslim University (AMU) took out a solidarity march in the campus on Sunday to protest against the arrest of Dr Kafeel Khan who was booked by Aligarh police under National Security Act (NSA). They threatened to launch a mass campaign if the doctor-turned-anti CAA activist is not released. The students also protested against the police action against anti-CAA protesters in Chennai.

After the march, medical students, along with AMU Students Coordination Committee, submitted a memorandum addressed to President Ram Nath Kovind and local administrative authorities. They demanded revocation of NSA on Dr Kafeel Khan and action to be taken against Chennai police. Students threatened to go for mass protest if NSA against Dr Khan is not revoked and action is not taken against Chennai police within 72 hours.

In the memorandum, students stated, “We the students of AMU condemn Chennai police brutality and seek immediate revocation of NSA on Khan. We demand a judicial inquiry and immediate action into the matter as freedom of speech is our fundamental right.”

AMU Students Coordination Committee member Faizul Khan claimed that district authorities violated the Supreme Court ruling which stated that a person can’t be booked under NSA if he has already been granted bail by the court. He told media that there was a judgment in this regard in case of Ramesh Yadav Vs District Magistrate Etah in 1986. He said, “I urge the district authorities to kindly go through it once and revoke NSA on Dr Khan.”

Pune: The Bombay high court has granted regular bail to senior police inspector Vishwanath Ghanwat, who was arrested in April 2017 for allegedly stealing Rs3 crore.

In March 2016, the officer allegedly stole the money from the safety vault of a builder’s office at Warnanagar in Kolhapur district on the pretext of drawing a panchanama relating to a theft case.

Ghanwat, who hails from Pune, was then posted with the Sangli police crime branch. “He was on a temporary bail on medical grounds, when the high court decided his regular bail on February 11,” his lawyer Satyam Nimbalkar told TOI.

Ghanwat, along with other accused in the case, is facing trial for various offences, including IPC Section 409 (criminal breach of trust by a public servant). The Kodoli police in Kolhapur has already filed a chargesheet against him in the Kolhapur sessions court.

The high court bench of Justice Nitin Sambre held, “Maximum punishment under Section 409 of the IPC is that of 10 years. Considering past conduct (of the applicant), the absence of criminal antecedents and the fact that applicant will be very much available for facing the trial, a case for grant of bail is made out.”

The bench noted that nothing incriminating was recovered from the applicant’s custodial interrogation. It directed his release on a bail bond of Rs1 lakh with one or more local sureties in the like amount, and restrained him from leaving Pune and Kolhapur without prior permission of the court and the investigating agency.

Realtor Zunjar Sarnobat had lodged an FIR relating to the theft of Rs3.11 crore in cash from realtor’s Warnanagar office on March 15, 2016. During panchanama, the police found cash Rs1.31 crore in the office’s safety vault. Sarnobat has claimed that this amount is less than Rs14 crore in cash he had kept in the vault. The police arrested one Mohiddin Mulla for the theft. He was released on bail a month later.

On April 16, 2017, Sarnobat lodged two fresh FIRs, alleging that separate groups, one of them including Ghanwat, collected Rs6 crore and Rs3 crore in cash from the vault on the pretext of taking Mulla to the scene of crime. He claimed Mulla revealed this to him when he met the accused after the latter was released on bail.

People who attended the protest said there was need to fight CAA, NRC and NPR in a united manner.

MALERKOTLA: From women to farmers and students to children, thousands of people cutting across religious lines joined Sunday’s anti-CAA protest in Malerkotla — touted to be the biggest stir against the controversial citizenship law in Punjab so far.

The protest against Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA), National Register of Citizens (NRC) and National Population Register (NPR) was organised at Grain Market Ground in Malerkotla town of Sangrur. The protesters vowed to fight against the law till it is repealed. Security had been beefed up in the dusty town in view of the protest.

Mahmood Ahmed Thind, Punjab president of the Indian Union Muslim League (IUML), one of the organisers, said the response to the protest was unprecedented. He said apart from members of various communities, members of Bharatiya Kisan Unions and student unions participated in the protest. “After this black law was passed by Union government, three marches in which more than 25,000 women participated have been organised in Malerkotla. Today, the number of protesters was more than a lakh and it was the biggest rally against CAA, NRC and NPR in Punjab. Such a large gathering speaks of the anger people have against the law. It is a fight for protecting the Constitution,” said Thind.

People who attended the protest said there was need to fight CAA, NRC and NPR in a united manner. “We will not allow even a single Muslim brother to lose citizenship. If that happens, we will also give it (citizenship) up. We need to fight CAA, NRC and NPR, so that the government’s evil designs are defeated. To start with, we should fight NPR. If it is implemented, many will end up in detention centres, which are worse than prisons. People there don’t even have rights which a prisoner has,” said Harsh Mander, a man at the protest.

He added if Bhagat Singh would have been alive today, he would have felt the people’s pain. “But I am happy that lakhs of Bhagat Singhs have come forward to save the country,” Mander said.

Activists from the protest in Shaheen Bagh, Delhi, also attended the agitation in Malerkotla. Mujtaba, one of the protesters from Shaheen Bagh, said the fight against CAA, NPR and NRC was everyone’s fight, including that of farmers. Mujtaba’s friend Avinash shouted slogans of qaumi ekta zindabad, kissan ekta zindabad, students unity zindabad (long live national unity, long live farmers’ unity, long live students’ unity), after his speech.

Women made up an equal number of protesters. Paramjit Kaur (53) of Dirba, who attended the stir with husband Jasvir Singh, said would not allow the government to divide people on religious lines.

A 73-year-old farmer from Panjgrayan Fatehgarh near Malerkotla said the Modi government was carrying out an injustice by trampling over the Constitution. “ I have four sons and have come here to secure their future,” he said.

310,['17/02/2020'],A struggle for space on roads in Alandi,"This story is from February 17, 2020

Pune: The pilgrim town of Alandi near Pune has witnessed a noticeable surge in crowd during the ongoing wedding season, with most of the halls and dharmshalas packed, which has added to the traffic congestion on the roads.

The surge has put a strain on the local traffic situation, particularly on the parking of vehicles, and also on water and other civic amenities.

Alandi is famous for the revered Sant Dnyaneshwar Maharaj’s temple and draws a large crowd of pilgrims throughout the year.

The wedding halls and Dharamshalas give an additional dimension to the bustling town and the season witnesses at least 100 wedding ceremonies simultaneously on a single auspicious day during the season, which will go on till the first week of June.

“Despite the traffic congestion issue in Alandi in the last few years, the police had done little in installing necessary traffic infrastructure in the town. There is not a single traffic signal in the town. There is no space to park vehicles. Visitors have to park on the side of the road, which reduces the carriageway. This ultimately leads to traffic congestion in the town,” a lawyer and activist Vilas Kate said. He has been pursuing the matter with the police and Alandi Municipal Corporation (AMC) for the last few years.

Owners of the wedding halls and dharmshalas have not left space for parking, a resident said.

“Why can’t the police register complaints against the owners? It is their responsibility to provide parking facilities to visitors. The AMC authorities should also fine them if they flout the rules,” Sandeep Pokale, a teacher and a regular visitor to the town, said.

Markal, Wadgaon Ghenand and Chakan are entry and exit points of the town. “Installation of traffic signals at these chowks is necessary to control vehicular movement. Industrial traffic from Markal and Solu goes from these chowks. The big vehicles occupy maximum space on the roads, which leads to traffic chaos in the town,” an officer from the Alandi police station said.

Meanwhile, additional commissioner of police Ramnath Pokale told TOI that they were working on a comprehensive traffic plan to improve the situation.

“We have recently discussed this issue in our meeting. Our officials have carried out a survey and are in the process of installing traffic signals, creating no parking zones, among others infrastructure required to control the traffic in the town,” he said.

He added that they had received several complaints about the traffic issues in the last few months.

“The wedding season is crucial for us as there is massive traffic in the town. A comprehensive traffic plan would be implemented in Alandi in the coming days,” he said.

Pune: The National Green Tribunal (NGT) has ordered a joint inspection by a three-member expert panel, headed by the Pune district collector, to verify the factual aspects of a plea alleging encroachments and construction of road on a 130m stretch of a natural stream that originates from the Bhamburda hills and merges into the Mula, covering a 4km distance.

The assistant commissioner of Pune Municipal Corporation’s (PMC) encroachment department and a nominated official of the Maharashtra Pollution Control Board (MPCB) are the other two members of the panel that has to submit its report to the green tribunal by March 19.

Gokhale road residents Devraj Bhatia and Vivek Bartake have claimed in the plea that the natural stream is seen as a water body in the existing land use survey map (2007-27) for the city’s Development Plan.

The NGT’s prinicpal bench in New Delhi, comprising Justice S P Wangdi and expert member Sidhanta Das, said in an order on February 13, “We are satisfied that substantial question relating to environment has been raised in the present case, considering the facts and circumstances set out in the application and on hearing the counsel for the applicant.”

The bench directed notices to be served to the respondents i.e. the PMC, district collector, MPCB, state department of environment and the chief engineer of the Khadakvasla irrigation division of the state department of water resources. The notices are returnable in three weeks.

Referring to the three-member panel, the bench said the MPCB should be the nodal agency for providing logistic support and coordination of the joint inspection. It further directed the applicants to furnish a complete set of papers related to the issue to the members of the panel.

Lawyer Saurabh Kulkarni, who is representing the applicants, said, “The applicants are residents of Plot No. 457 abutting the stream. After concreting of the stream for the construction of the road, they had to raise the wall of their properties to prevent the excess floodwaters and dust (from the road) from flowing into their house. Every year during monsoon, their houses are flooded with water due to the road encroaching upon the natural water flow of the area.”

He added, “The construction of the road has led to traffic flow in a narrow residential area, which was otherwise not designated for vehicular movement and has consequently led to noise and air pollution in the locality.”

313,['17/02/2020'],Civic body plans to stop PMPML buses in Peth areas,"This story is from February 17, 2020

Pune: The civic body is planning to stop the PMPML buses plying on the narrow roads in the old city areas and promote e-rickshaws to curb traffic congestion.

A senior official of the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) told TOI that the corporation would allocate funds for e-rickshaws to ensure that more people could buy and operate them at low fares.

“We have discussed the plan with the Central Institute of Road Transport (CIRT) and are seeking their opinion. The roads in the Peth areas are narrow and movement of buses is difficult, which causes traffic congestion,” PMC commissioner Shekhar Gaikwad told TOI.

He said though the areas for the e-rickshaws to operate were not yet decided, the option might reduce traffic snarls. “The PMC is contemplating e-rickshaws for the local commuters’ benefit. The e-rickshaw operators will charge subsidized fares and connect the old city areas with the main roads, where the bus movement is regular,” Gaikwad said.

Statistics available with the Regional Transport Office (RTO) revealed that only 129 e-rickshaws had been registered in the past two years.

“The numbers are not good if you compare them to other cities. But if the PMC backs this initiative, then more people may opt for buying e-rickshaws. We need to ensure that people do not have to pay a huge amount as fares. The charges should be on a par or less than the bus fares,” Gaikwad said.

A Pune Mahanagar Parivahan Mahamandal Limited (PMPML) official said, “E-rickshaw seems to be a good idea. We can use the buses for many other areas, where connectivity is not up to the mark. But for this, there has to be a proper planning. We can also give our inputs.”

A section of the commuters and activists, however, is not convinced with the PMC’s idea. “The PMC’s bicycle sharing plan has fallen flat. The e-rickshaw plan sounds ambitious. But if the civic body is serious, they should first ensure proper research and groundwork. The commuters should not suffer,” said Anand Waghmare, a resident of Somwar Peth.

PMP Pravasi Manch activist Sanjay Shitole said, “The e-rickshaws will cause more traffic chaos. Each e-rickshaw can ferry around four to five passengers at a time. I wonder what will happen if several e-rickshaws start plying on the narrow stretches of the old city. The PMC should understand that roads in Pune are wide but encroachments have made them narrow. Why don’t they focus on removing the encroachments first?”

Sujit Patwardhan of NGO Parisar said banning the buses on the ground that the roads are narrow was not a good idea. “If the roads are narrow, then cars should be banned first. Next, all motorized vehicles should be stopped to reduce air pollution and congestion. Though the e-vehicles don’t pollute, they contribute to congestion.”

Graphics

PROMOTE E-RICKSHAWS

* According to the PMC’s audit department, 1,400 buses ply on the road daily across the city

* On February 10, there were 1,800 buses plying on the roads as part of the ‘bus day’ event

EXPERTS & ACTIVISTS SAID

- E-rickshaws should be used to support the PMPML and not to remove it

- A proper survey of the area to make it a car-free zone with some concession for residents’ cars by offering them lower charges to park in multistorey parking lots

- The focus should be on reducing vehicles that make congestion, pollution and noise worse

- Elaborate planning would be needed. But, that was better than replacing large capacity buses by low occupancy vehicles

- If at all the plan comes to fore, the PMC will have to provide the necessary infrastructure such as parking points, charging stations

Chandigarh: Punjab Police has started a monthly appreciate-and-commend scheme to recognise top performers in the force and encourage personnel to give their best at work. DGP Dinkar Gupta on Sunday said the initiative was launched during a meeting of the force’s top brass at Punjab Police Academy (PPA), Phillaur.

During the meeting, 15 personnel, including three woman sub-inspectors, were honoured with the DGP’s commendation disc. Awardees included two inspectors, six sub-inspectors, three assistant sub-inspectors, a head constable and three constables.

The DGP said the performance of these personnel was rated outstanding in policing areas, such as action against terrorists and gangsters, arrest of proclaimed offenders, drug seizures, property forfeiture in drug cases, spreading awareness against drugs, investigation of sensitive cases, community policing and police station management.

Gupta said he hoped the scheme motivated personnel to excel in their job. “This initiative will be a monthly feature and I would personally interact with the awardees and also host a lunch for them at the Punjab Police headquarters in Chandigarh.”

Nominations will be sought from police chiefs of all districts by the 25th of every month, and these will be screened by a committee comprising senior police officers from the headquarters and the field. The names would be announced by the fifth of every month.

315,['17/02/2020'],ARI team uses silver coating to stop dental implant failure,"This story is from February 17, 2020

Pune: Scientists at the Agharkar Research Institute (ARI) Scientists have used silver’s antibacterial properties to develop silver-coated materials that can reduce dental implant failures.

This endeavour was recently recognized by the Department of Science and Technology.

ARI researchers developed a nano-scale thin film of silver on dental implant material to address implant failures, especially due to bacterial infections.

“The nano-silver coat ensured controlled release of silver up to 22 days, maintaining a long-term antibacterial activity,” lead researcher J M Rajwade, scientist of the nanobioscience group at the ARI, said.

“Dental implants are useful to make up for teeth lost to dental caries, gum diseases and other causes,” Rajwade added.

Rajwade said this is an ongoing work at the institute. It was initially started in 2014.

“Titanium is a popular implant material because of its mechanical properties, biocompatibility, chemical stability, low toxicity, and corrosion resistance,” she said.

“Though implant alloys have improved in design to achieve success in almost 95% cases, implant failures occur in around 5% cases due to poor oral hygiene, bacterial infections, diabetes, hypertension, and the use of tobacco,” she added.

Silver, she added, is known to inhibit the growth of bacteria.

This nano-scale thin film of silver on the titanium surface could reduce implant failures due to infection, which can affect our lives.

“We are trying to test other non-toxic metals that could fight harmful organisms that affect humans,” she added.

316,['17/02/2020'],Maharashtra CM Uddhav Thackeray offers to set up first varsity for judges in state,"This story is from February 17, 2020

Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray addresses lawyers at state lawyer's conference

NASHIK: Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray on Sunday announced that his government will establish the country’s first judges’ university in the state.

“The state will co-operate with the Bar Council of India for getting the first judges’ university in the state,” Thackeray said while addressing a gathering of lawyers on the Nashik district court campus during a two-day conference.

The chief minister asked the Bar Council to present its proposal for the varsity that would be run by the judiciary but constructed by the state government. The functioning of the judges’ varsity will be on the lines of the National Defence Academy , he added.

The CM also urged for an immediate review of the archaic laws with the help of chief ministers from across the country. “There is an urgent need for our country to get rid of the archaic laws that were incorporated by the British. The Bar Council must take up an exercise to review the situation and undertake measures,” he said.

Thackeray appealed to the Bar Council to take measures to ensure that the number of litigations goes down and the accused are convicted and the sentences are also executed without delay.

“The Nirbhaya gang-rape case is still open and the convicts are yet to be hanged. Such incidents send a wrong signal to society. The judiciary should act swiftly so that there is no reason to have fast-track courts,” he said.

Thackeray also appealed to the four pillars of democracy — the judiciary, the executive, the legislature and the media — to act cohesively to create a deterrent for anti-social elements. “For faster and accurate delivery of justice, we appeal to all the four pillars of the democracy to work in coordination with each other. They can discuss issues and come up with a collective solution,” he added.

The Sena chief also underlined the need for a stronger society based on values for which he sought the help of lawyers. “Ensuring a value-based society is not the job of government alone. Lawyers must also pitch in by taking a conscious decision on defending perpetrators accused of committing heinous crimes when things are crystal clear. This will refrain people from committing crimes,” he said.

The CM assured co-operation with the Bar Council for constructing Vakil Bhawan and Advocate Welfare Trust.

The programme saw the presence of Supreme Court Judge Justice BV Gavai, transport minister Anil Parab, Justice Prabhudesai and Justice Makarand Karnik among others.

Meanwhile, District guardian minister Chhagan Bhujbal appealed to the lawyer fraternity to make efforts to set up a circuit bench of the Bombay high court at Nashik.

CM lays foundation for 7-storey court building

The CM also laid the foundation for the seven-storey building of the district and sessions court. The Rs 171 building will house 45 court.

Want other victims to speak up, says girl’s dad

(The victim's identity has not been revealed to protect her privacy as per Supreme Court directives on cases related to sexual assault)

MUMBAI: Though it is not the end of nine years of trauma, the daughter of a US-based businessman has come a long way in finally nailing the culprit and getting him arrested on Sunday. The culprit had allegedly sexually abused her for three years at her Andheri (W) home before she migrated to the US for higher studies when she was 12.The victim said her guitar teacher molested her and spoke vulgar language. The college student flew down early on Sunday, and after recording her statement Oshiwara police arrested Bharat Panchal alias Raju (55). Panchal will be produced before Andheri metropolitan magistrate court on Monday. The woman who took four days’ leave, will fly back on Monday.A case was registered by her father after he flew here on January 2. Panchal was arrested from Bangur Nagar in Malad (W) and booked under Indian Penal Code sections 354 (outrage modesty), 506 (criminal intimidation) and 509 (word, gesture or act intended to insult modesty of a woman). “On seeing Panchal at the police station, my daughter screamed at him in relief. He committed the offences in 2007-10 before we relocated. She had lost hope of living. We stood by her side during the hard times, with many years of sleepless nights. She opened up after we got her counselled for almost five years, and she gradually revealed the trauma to a psychiatrist in the US,” the businessman told TOI.TOI learned that the mother came to know about Panchal taking guitar classes through the mother of her daughter’s Juhu school classmate in 2007. “He said he was ready to take classes in our flat every Tuesday from 4pm-5pm. Initially, all was well. Gradually, I noticed changes in my daughter’s behaviour, and she would be cranky on Tuesdays. I noticed her crying at night many times. When I asked her about it, but she did not reveal anything. In 2010, when she went to Class VIII she told me that the school taught her about sex education. I again asked if she faced abuse. She tried to tell me, but stopped in between,” mentioned the FIR.The mother even tried to check on the teacher’s behaviour and used to sit along with her daughter during class. “In 2011, I decided to relocate with family. During this time, my daughter’s health worsened. From 2015 we started taking her to psychiatrists in US, and she started revealing the reason. She said Panchal used to abuse her. He used to show her obscene photos and told her to wear loose clothes,” said the father. “I have seen the bad phase of my daughter’s career when she used to scream at night. I wanted to make the act public so that other kids who have fallen victim should open up and nail him.” Senior inspector Dayanand Bangar declined to comment.",mumbai,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74166665,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-462637,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/molested-as-a-child-woman-flies-back-from-us-to-nail-music-teacher/articleshow/74166407.cms

Lucknow: Six months after the launch of the command and control centre under the Smart Cities Mission by Lucknow Municipal Corporation, citizens can now register all their grievances related to any civic issue at one place.

People can lodge complaints related to electricity and water supply, garbage disposal, streetlights, stray animals and transportation with the command and control centre. To do so, they will have to install the Lucknow Smart City app available for all operating systems.

People will have to open GPS in their smartphones before lodging a complaint. The command centre runs on ‘Master System Integrator (MSI)’ technology that has an in-built log system which will locate the exact location of the person and forward it along with the complaint to the department concerned instantly.

After registering a grievance, the complainant can keep track of it by simply entering the complaint number in the app.

Built at a cost of Rs 3.5 crore, the centre was formally launched on August 15. While complaints related to LMC were being entertained here, now, grievances related to all civic departments are being accepted.

The decision to construct the centre was taken in 2015 under the Smart Cities Mission. The centre is divided in two portions. On one floor, monitoring of traffic is being done through Integrated Traffic Management System, while the second floor is for looking after civic issues through MSI.

Pune: The rural police have started the Bharosa Cell initiative across seven divisions of the district to deal with issues related to women’s security.

Records available with the Pune rural police reveal that at least 6,000 cases related to women — from dowry demands to domestic violence — get registered in the district every year.

The Bharosa (confidence) Cell initiative was introduced in Pune city last year. In Pune rural, units of the cell have been set up in Khed, Ranjangaon MIDC, Daund, Junnar, Baramati, Bhor and Haveli.

“Finding out the root cause of each complaint is a difficult task for us in the current set-up because of manpower shortage, daily work and also the insensitive approach towards such cases at the police station-level. There have been instances of the an in-charge of a police station not getting the adequate time to understand the nitty-gritty of a complaint related to issues faced by women. We want to change the scenario and have set up these cells during the past fortnight,” superintendent of police (Pune rural) Sandeep Patil told TOI.

The rural police have ensured dedicated infrastructure for the facility. “Besides policing, we have roped in counsellors and psychiatrists to listen to the women’s complaints and ensure early assistance. Many cases, particularly those of conjugal nature, can be easily resolved if we take them up at the early stage,” Patil said.

Deputy superintendent of police (Daund division) Aishwarya Sharma said, “In the non-cognizable cases, many women do not want to register complaints but want solutions. In such cases, our experts such as doctors, counsellors and social activists can play a key role.”

Pune police commissioner K Venkatesham told TOI, “Our cell receives about 25 new complaints a day. It shows women have confidence in our system. In fact, Director General of Police Subodh Kumar Jaiswal has instructed all officers in charge of the commissionerate and rural headquarters to start the facility.”

A senior police officer said, “During the conference of DGPs in Pune earlier this year, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had emphasized women’s security and asked all the officers to carefully deal with their concerns.”

Pune: Devotees will not be allowed to perform ‘abhishek’ and related puja rituals on the ‘samadhi’ (resting place) of Sant Dnyaneshwar Maharaj inside the sanctum sanctorum of the famous Alandi temple.

The Shri Dnyaneshwar Maharaj Sansthan Committee, a six-member government-appointed body that manages the temple, has made the decision in view of a report submitted in November last year by the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI), western zone, Aurangabad.

Two ASI experts had inspected the samadhi in October last year before submitting a report suggesting measures to check deterioration of the samadhi structure owing to persistent use of water, milk, etc, for puja rituals.

The report stated, “It is suggested that number of abhishek in a day may be minimized. The possibility of metal replica can be opted out for touching of devotees. Abhishek water and remnants should be cleaned and wiped out thoroughly after the completion of the ritual. Whatever restoration work to be carried out, the materials used should be compatible, reversible and if possible transparent as per archaeological principles.”

The committee met in December last year to discuss the ASI recommendations and unanimously passed a resolution that favoured stopping of puja rituals inside the temple’s sanctum sanctorum.

Vikas Dhage-Patil, chief trustee of the committee, said, “Many devotees had submitted complaints about standing in queues for hours to take darshan of the samadhi. With the help of CCTV cameras fitted in the temple premises and sanctum, we found that the people performing abhishek in the sanctum would block the entry point. As a result, fewer devotees could enter the sanctum and take darshan. As per our analysis, around 3,700 devotees could take darshan between 6am and 11am (considered as peak period) in a day. After stopping the puja, now 8,000 devotees take darshan in the same time slot.”

SECUNDERABAD: The state government’s delay in releasing its share for the railway over bridge (ROB) near Bolarum station has vexed commuters who frequent the two link roads towards Kompally and Rajiv Rahadari.

The South Central Railways had sanctioned approval for this project and sought 50 per cent share from the Telangana government. However, the government’s failure to sanction its share has forced commuters of neighbouring colonies of Bolarum to spend additional minutes at the LC Gate no 250 where the ROB is proposed.

With no clarity on the ROB, members of the Federation of New Bolarum Colonies Welfare Association filed an RTI in January, this year to know the status of the project. Members of the federation claim that with increased development in the area and number of trains stopping at Bolarum station has added to the traffic woes.

“We have been approaching government authorities for years now to expedite the ROB work. However, there has been no progress. The traffic hasonly worsened with frequency of trains having increased at the Bolarum station,” said Ch Simhadri, president of Federation of New Bolarum Colonies Welfare Association, which represents over 30 colonies with a population of over 20,000.

Bolarum residents have asked Telangana government to expedite work on the ROB. “@KTRTRS Really appreciate your attention in regard to #ROBs & #MMTS phase 2.

NASHIK: Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief Sharad Pawar said on Sunday that he was apprehensive about the central government having something to hide about the previous Devendra Fadnavis-led government in the state in relation to the Elgar Parishad case and this prompted the decision to transfer the case probe to the National Investigation Agency (NIA).

Speaking to reporters at Jalgaon, Pawar said he has written to chief minister Uddhav Thackeray and state home minister Anil Deshmukh stressing on the need to set up a special investigation team headed by a retired judge to inquire into the matter.

“The violence at Koregaon Bhima (on January 1, 2018), took place a day after the Elgar Parishad was held (in Pune on December 31, 2017) and the two events are different issues. The Elgar Parishad was attended by poets, novelists etc. and they were critical of the government. But, does their criticism amount to being an anti-national,” he wondered. “Those taking part in the Elgar Parishad were only expressing their views about the functioning of the government,” he added.

Two days back, Pawar had disapproved of CM Thackeray ’s consent to a probe by the NIA and went on to recall the circumstances in which the Centre took the decision (on January 24).

“On the morning that day, deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar and the home minister had a meeting with police officials to review details about the Elgar Parishad case. Strangely, the same evening the Centre took the decision to transfer the case to the NIA,” he said.

Pawar, however, maintained that the MVA government in the state is stable and would be complete its full term.

In a sudden move, Pawar cancelled his engagements in Nashik on Sunday and instead headed to Mumbai. He was supposed to have a meeting with the NCP cadres in the forenoon and attend the concluding session of the state lawyers’ conference in the evening. The chopper carrying Pawar landed at the helipad at Bhujbal Knowledge City and after few minutes it again took off for Mumbai. NCP insiders said that Pawar went to Mumbai following some urgent issue.

To avoid inconvenience to lakhs of consumers, the water board is focussing on paying the current bills, instead of pending dues,” sources in HMWS&SB admitted. “We are aware that with summer around the corner, water is an essential commodity that is hugely in demand.We don’t want people to suffer,” they added.Explaining the reason behind the increase in monthly power bill amount, an official said that the power consumption doubled after the water board extended water supply to 190 villages and municipalities located within the outer ring road (ORR) limits, apart from the GHMC and its peripheral circles.“Before commissioning the water supply scheme to these 190 villages, the water board used to receive an average power bill of Rs 40 crore to Rs 50 crore per month and now, the amount had gone up to nearly Rs 100 crore,” said sources.Despite the water board collecting Rs 120 crore to Rs 150 crore per month, most of the amount is routed to maintain the water supply network. “The power dues are accumulating due to interest, which TSSPDCL is adding to the pending arrears. It is the first time in water board’s history that the department has defaulted on such a large amount,” sources said.“The water board will coordinate with TSSDPCL officials to avoid any lapses in water pumping and disturbanc in distribution network at different sources such as Godavari, Krishna, Osmansagar and Himayatsagar,” a senior official said.Some are of the opinion that state government should intervene. “Unless government takes initiative, there is no solution to clear dues without obstructing service,”a retired board official said.",hyderabad,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74165544,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-92316,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/water-board-coffers-run-dry-as-power-dept-dues-of-rs-1k-cr-pile-up/articleshow/74165545.cms

Lucknow University

LUCKNOW: Students of BSc third semester at Lucknow University faced quite a few anxious moments when the varsity’s online scorecard displayed results of only two subjects, with the remark ‘incomplete’ in front of the third subject leaving them rattled.

“I was shocked to see ‘incomplete’ displayed in front of the Geology paper, while I was awarded marks for the remaining two subjects. I got confused and rushed to the university to find out why my scorecard displayed ‘incomplete’,” said Amit, a BSc student. “Later I got to know that I was not alone and that the scorecard of all the students displayed the ‘incomplete’ remark. The examination officials told us that the answercopies of the subject were yet to be evaluated, so the scorecard was indicating the subject as incomplete,” he added.

“The results have already been declared very late and that too incomplete. Most of the students are not able to focus as they are in a dilemma whether they have passed the examination or not,” said BSc student Ankita Singh. The results of the odd semesters of the university were to be declared by February 1, but were delayed by 16 days. According to sources at the examination department, the answercopies of 15 courses are yet to be evaluated, of which maximum are pertaining to the Arts courses, while in science courses, evaluation of Geology, statistics and mathematics courses is incomplete. In commerce, answercopy bundles of economics and applied economics are yet to be opened for evaluation.

When contacted, controller of examination Lt Col AK Mishra said that the faculty members were not turning up for evaluation despite repeated reminders. “Soon a notice will be served to all defaulters and a meeting of the heads of the departments will be called up,” he said.

MSRTC to cut 33 trees

NASHIK: A total of 33 trees on the premises of the Maharashtra State Regional Transport Corporation (MSRTC) bus terminal at Mela stand will be axed for the construction of a circulating area for the movement of buses within the terminus.

“We have got the green light from the Bombay high court to chop the trees. The court has also directed us to plant and grow 160 trees at other locations within the district. The MSRTC will adhere to the directives of the high court and get the work done to ensure the bus terminus becomes operational,” a senior MSRTC official said.

The work for re-development of 20-platform Mela bus stand was started on July 30, 2017, by former chief minister Devendra Fadnavis in the presence of the then railway minister Suresh Prabhu with a promise that it would be completed within the span of 18 months.

The trees spread across the bus stand are also obstructing the construction of passenger lounge and waiting areas. “We had first sought permission from the NMC, but it was denied. We then approached the high court. With conditional permission in place, we are now looking forward to complete the works within three months,” the official said.

Currently, over 80% of the work is complete. The project cost is around Rs 10.91 crore and the MSRTC intends to integrate all its inter-district services at this bus stand. The entire cost is being borne by the state government and the terminus will be developed on the lines of the bus stands that have been developed in Gujarat.

The stand also has a mini-theatre and commercial outlets. The passenger lounge will be completely air conditioned. The first six platforms will be dedicated to non-stop services to Pune, Dhule, Jalgaon, Malegaon, Satana and Shirdi. The MSRTC is planning to introduce non-stop buses to Shirdi depending upon the flow of passengers.

Other platforms will host buses to all religious places in Nashik district, all taluka places in the district and other district headquarters.

Smart gates were earlier installed at Millennium Park and two other ghats

KOLKATA: The state transport department has decided to install smart gates at all 26 ferry ghats in city. Setting up of smart gates at three ferry ghats has already increased revenue by Rs 15,000 to Rs 20,000 a day, which amounts to Rs 60 lakh a year. Encouraged by plugging of revenue leakage at only three ghats, the transport department has decided to take the step.

The move will help integrate the ferry system with the city’s bus transportat system. The commuters can seamlessly move from bus to ferry with the same smart transport card they use to pay the bus fare. There will be no need to stand in queue, said a senior transport department officer.

On an experimental basis, West Bengal Transport Corporation installed smart gates at the Fairlie Place, Shipping Corporation of India (Millennium Park jetty) and Howrah station ghats and saw more than 20% jump in revenue — Rs 5 lakh a month. A close scrutiny revealed that a large number of commuters, in connivance with ferry ghat managers, were travelling without tickets.

“We have now decided to install turnstile gates at all 26 ghats. Apart from plugging revenue leakage, the smart gate will facilitate seamless movement of commuters. The commuters don’t need to stand in queue. After disembarking from bus, a commuter can straightaway get onto a ferry by using the same smart card. This will save a lot of time,” said a senior transport department officer.

With the World Bank aid, the state government is revamping the highly underutilised waterway. The old rickety pontoons and gangways are being replaced and minimum required amenities are being added. A lifeguard has been made mandatory at every jetty. The transport department has projected nearly 100% growth of commuters in the next few years.

Rourkela: A 27-year-old tribal youth allegedly hacked four members of his brother’s family to death on Saturday night before surrendering to the police. Among those killed were two minors. Police suspect the murders could be related to financial dispute.

Sources said brothers Kande Munda (34) and Kali Munda (27) used to live in their ancestral home at Deuladihi village, under Bonei police station of Sundargarh district. On Sunday morning, Kali went to Bonei police station and told the police that he had killed his brother, sister-in-law Sumi Munda (30) and their two children — Malani Munda (7) and Mana Munda (5) — the previous night.

Hearing this, the police went to the village and recovered the bodies. Kali’s wife and two-year-old daughter also lives in the same house but had gone to attend a wedding on Saturday.

Police sources said Kali and Kande, both labourers, were at loggerheads over some money matter. Kali had apparently given Rs 1 lakh to Kande a couple of years back. Recently, he had been asking for the money but his brother and his wife were refusing to return it on some pretext or the other.

On Saturday night, when Kande and his family were at home, Kali allegedly attacked them with an axe and killed them.

Senior police officials, including Rourkela SP K Shiva Subramani visited the house along with a forensic team and launched an investigation. “We have sent the bodies for post mortem,” said S C Pathy, additional SP, Rourkela. “Accused Kali has been arrested and the weapon used to commit the crime has been seized,” he added.

333,['17/02/2020'],Colleges miffed over promotion of schemes,"This story is from February 17, 2020

Mumbai: Can publicising the language of a state or enrolling unorganised workers for a government scheme be a round-the-year activity for an IIT or an autonomous college ? Leading educational institutions receiving grants from the Centre are weighed down by a peculiar problem: the ministry of human resource development has spelt out a rigorous schedule of “non-academic” activities which have to be carried out almost throughout the year, ranging from promotion of flagship missions such as Swachh Bharat to cultural activities such as language lessons and classical performances.

At a recent workshop in Delhi, social media coordinators from premier institutions such as IITs, IIMs and IISERs, among others, were not only asked to make extensive use of their Twitter handles to promote their own work but also endorse the ministry’s activities by retweeting their tweets.

An official from one of the IITs said they were asked to tweet several times a day. “While this is still doable, we are expected to hold a host of activities for which it is difficult to find students given their busy schedule. Many directives come at the eleventh hour, and even if we manage, we are unable to show solid participation in the photographs,” said the IIT official. A former IIT director said that the premier institutes find it difficult to organise cultural events. “Our students will have to be trained for those cultural events, but we do not have trainers for classical singing and dancing. Not many are willing to do these activities. The idea of holding such events could be gradually brought into the IIT system and it cannot happen overnight,” said the director.

Under the government’s campaign of Ek Bharat Shreshtha Bharat (EBSB), the MHRD wants students to at least learn alphabets, 100 sentences, five songs and 20 proverbs in the language of a partner state. Maharashtra was paired with Odisha for this campaign, and students were expected to learn Odia through online mobile applications. They are also expected to take various pledges, including for the Swachhata campaign, national unity and single-use plastic in Odia. Students from Rajasthan are paired with Assam, Haryana with Telangana, and Himachal Pradesh with Kerala, and so on.

“Another plan under the EBSB was to hold a cultural exchange programme between paired colleges from Maharashtra and Odisha. A teacher and 50 students from each college were to visit Odisha for a week. But no one had a clue how to go about it. Mails to the programme officers in Delhi went unanswered. Much to our relief, the exchange plan was shelved but other programmes will still continue,” said a nodal officer from one of the Mumbai colleges.

In another bizarre activity, students from colleges funded under the Rashtriya Uchchatar Shikshan Abhiyan (RUSA) were asked to promote the Central government’s pension scheme in the unorganized sector. A RUSA official from Maharashtra said students can approach their domestic help, drivers, gardeners or watchmen to promote the scheme. While most activities are being asked of RUSA-funded colleges, many others are common for all higher education institutions.

A principal said colleges are expected to appoint a nodal officer for all such campaigns, submit a regular report and upload photos and videos on designated websites. “In January, the MHRD sent a circular asking all colleges to observe Swachhata Pakhwada. We were asked to hold close to 20 activities in a span of two weeks. The mail came just two days before January 16, when the campaign was supposed to kickstart. From plogging (the concept of picking litter while jogging) to plantation of trees, to developing innovative technologies for waste recycling, awareness campaigns, etc, everything was listed out for specific days and colleges were expected to give daily reports. It was practically impossible, but we still managed to do it for a few days,” said the principal.

“While the concept for holding these government campaigns is good, they cannot have prolonged activities. Events that can be completed in a day are stretched to a week or a month. The compulsion of submitting daily reports and uploading photos will soon make a mockery of the entire process. People will soon fabricate information to show compliance,” said a principal.

A senior MHRD official, though, said, “IITs and other higher education institutions are part of the government and these are national programmes meant for nation-building. These are Constitutional values and national policies, which every government must insist on and every citizen must follow. There is no question of it being non-academic. For example, for Swachhata Pakhwada, can you say cleanliness is not my business? Look at it positively. It is the nation’s idea which is now coming out as government schemes and policies. We should all support it.” The official added that reporting the events is essential for monitoring the activities.

Pune: Trees planted by the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) near the Hadapsar Industrial Estate are being chopped down by local slum dwellers to build huts.

Local residents said the problem started back in 2017. Environmentalist and local resident Sudha Iyer said, “The slum came up overnight and now has around 35 huts. This is happening near the Mula Mutha canal. They are chopping down trees in the nearby areas for their huts and other purposes. These were planted by the PMC officials in April 2017.”

Iyer has tried contacting civic officials. “I’ve been on it for years, but nothing has progressed. I’ve been sending out messages, and have not received proper replies from anybody. This side of the canal was kept free. Citizens along with the Magarpatta team got together and we tried to clear all the shanties on this side of the Mula Mutha canal. However, they keep springing up overnight. In the last two weeks, they’ve been cutting down the trees planted by the PMC.”

She added that the area was earlier irrigation land that fell in the blue line of the canal. “Suddenly, 35 huts came up on this side in the last few years. This part used to be empty land earlier and is irrigation land in the blue belt of the Mula Mutha that leads to Khadakwasla. The slum has encroached on the blue line. The canal is an officially active irrigation canal. It is an active eco zone.”

The area had witnessed flooding during monsoon this year. “The canal had overflowed, but the slum didn’t move. A huge dump yard has also come up beside the slum area. The encroachment just keeps flourishing and they are dirtying the canal water.”

About the tree plantation, Iyer said, “This was a small patch allotted with a fence where these trees were planted. A security guard was posted here for a while. Now, these trees are being are cut down.”

However, the budgetary allocation for these was Rs 10 crore in the last budget, along with Rs 250 crore for the ‘one district-one product’ scheme. With many businesses taking a hit under demonetisation and GST, MSME industry bodies have been demanding greater allocation in the budget. This year, other than setting up export promotion offices in each district, the government is also considering a proposal to start a course on entrepreneurship in schools and start a CM Swarozgar Scheme to provide seed money for startups. This could see a larger budgetary allocation under ODOP this year.",lucknow,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74167401,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-419125,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/with-eye-on-2022-budget-to-give-boost-to-infra-projects/articleshow/74166258.cms

NASHIK: The Nashik Municipal Corporation (NMC) has snapped the water connections of 180 more tax defaulters.

In January, the civic body had cut off connections of over 200 water tax defaulters.

The crackdown is against those who have still not paid their dues, despite notices.

The civic body has set a water tax collection target of Rs 65 crore for financial year 2019-20. So far, it has collected Rs 45 crore. Officials have been rushing to collect the remaining Rs 20 crore before the end of the financial year, which is only some weeks away.

“Our objective is to collect maximum water tax from defaulters. Snapping water connection is part of our action against defaulters,"" an NMC official said. The official said connections will be restored after dues are settled by users.

Of the 180 water connections cut recently, 65 are from the Satpur division - the maximum number. A total of 41 connections were cut in the Cidco area and 38 within the Nashik Road division. The remaining connections are from the other three divisions: Panchavati, Nashik East and Nashik West divisions.

The NMC had started to cut off water supply connections of defaulters from August. Some 2,500 lines of defaulters were cut in just two months - August and September. The NMC had to stop this drive due to the state assembly elections in October. The civic body then resumed it in December, during which it cut off another 400 connections.

There are a total of 1.96 lakh water connections in the city: 1.88 lakh are residential lines; 4,000 are commercial lines and another 4,000 are to non-commercial users.

Municipal commissioner Radhakrishna Game had recently asked the water supply department to speed up its drive against water and property tax defaulters.

The NMC had collected a water tax of Rs 40 crore in the last financial year 2018-19.

KOLHAPUR: The ongoing economic census has nothing to do with any citizenship law or rules, said Kolhapur district collector Daulat Desai . He requested citizens to cooperate with the enumerators who have been provided with identity cards of e-Governance Services India Limited, one of the undertakings of the central government.

The appeal comes against the backdrop of citizens of one locality questioning two economic census enumerators. The locals suspected the enumerators were carrying out the National Register of Citizens ( NRC ) exercise. The district authorities reached the spot and clarified that the persons taking information are the enumerators of the 7th Economic Census, which started a couple of months ago.

Desai said, “Through the census, we are collecting details of various establishments. As of now, details of 1.63 families with small businesses have been collected. We have to complete the exercise by March 31. This exercise is important for the implementation of development schemes. It has nothing to do with the citizenship-related laws or rules. Misunderstandings are being created. I appeal to the citizens to check the identity cards provided to the enumerators.”

Activists claim that there is a lot of confusion among the minorities and the financially weaker families regarding the survey. At many places, the exercise is likely to be halted. To avoid any untoward condition, the activists demand a meeting with Desai.

Abhishek Mithari, a city-based activist who went to the spot after the enumerators were questioned, said: “Some sections of the society are angry with the recent developments related to the Citizenship Amendment Act. Every survey-like exercise will be seen with suspicion. The enumerators are at risk. The mob cooled down only after the officials of the agency assured them that a meeting will be held with the district collector to address their doubts.”

The survey is taking place across the district. The information is collected into three categories — small business run by households, job details of the family members, and industrial establishments. The details of establishments in the service industry too are being registered.

Mayor Alok Sharma with BJP MLA Vishwas Sarang, Krishna Gaur unveiling the statue of Rani Kamlapati in Bhopal o... Read More

BHOPAL: Gond queen Rani Kamlapati’s statue was unveiled on Sunday amid much controversy. Shoddy handling of the ceremony could make heads roll within the Bhopal Municipal Corporation (BMC), according to sources. The state government has sought explanation from the BMC about the matter. Unveiling of the Gond queen’s statue has embarrassed many Congress leaders. The statue was unveiled barely 48 hours before mayor Alok Sharma's term ends.

Despite the fiasco, BMC did not get its act together. Hours after the inauguration on Sunday, rumours spread that the inauguration plaque, commemorating the unveiling ceremony, had been removed.

In fact, the plaque was never fixed to the main statue. It was placed on a temporary pedestal for the function at the inauguration site at Kilol Park. It was to be later fixed to the base of the statue.

What made the situation even worse was that the BMC had left the pedestal behind. The missing marble plague from the pedestal gave an impression that the plaque installed in the morning had been removed by the government.

Questions are also being raised whether consent was sought from four senior state government ministers and one MLA for attending the function. Sources said that the invitation and unveiling of statue was kept a secret within the BMC itself as invitation cards were printed late on Friday evening.

Senior BMC officials did not respond when contacted. Police presence in the vicinity of the statue has been increased.

Politics over statues has this time given the BJP ammunition to hit out at the Congress, whose leaders were not in attendance. In its defence, Congress dubbed the statue installation a violation of norms.

On Sunday morning, Sharma, along with BJP MLA Vishwas Sarang and Krishna Gaur and other corporators had participated in the unveiling of the statue. It is situated at Lower Lake, below the remains of the Rani Kamlapati palace, the only Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) protected monument in Bhopal. The statue unveiling was originally planned to coincide with inauguration of Arch Bridge over the Upper Lake. The project has been delayed by almost two years.

“Absence of Congress invitees is an insult to the Gond people. Congress has been disrespectful to great historical figures in the recent past. It includes proposal of installing a statue of former CM Arjun Singh on a location where freedom fighter Chandrashekar Azad ’s statue was once placed,” said Sharma, who belongs to the BJP.

Earlier in 2017, Congress had opposed removing of the statue of former president Shankar Dayal Sharma from the intersection at Reth Ghat. It had then dubbed it as an insult to the great leader from Bhopal who rose to become India’s president. Another incident was removal of the statue of former PM Indira Gandhi for the construction of flyover near district collectorate. The statue was relocated almost three years on in 2015 at the MP Congress headquarters.

On Sunday, after the unveiling of the statue, BJP leaders and supporters went to Minto Hall and sat under the statue of Mahatma Gandhi humming ‘Congress Ko Sanmati De Bhagwan’. The protest went on for about two hours.

As per the invite sent by the BMC, Congress MLA and Bhopal district in-charge, Govind Singh, was to be the chief guest of the function. However, he did not attend the ceremony. Later, Singh stated that since the statue was not installed as per norms, he did not participate in the function.

Other invitees on the invitation card included urban development minister, Jaivardhan Singh , Bhopal north MLA Arif Aqueel and local corporator, Sabista Zaki.

Congress supporters, led by Zaki, showed black flags when Sharma arrived for the unveiling of the statue.

To prevent any law and order problem, the statue was unveiled under heavy police presence. Zaki dubbed the installation of the statue as illegal and without proper permissions. As a result of the arch bridge construction, around three houses along Kilol park are marked for demolition. Zaki is opposed to the move and has called for diversion of the bridge design landing to protect the affected people.

344,['17/02/2020'],"UP: BJP to dispel doubts on CAA among Dalits, poor","This story is from February 17, 2020

LUCKNOW: Even as the Opposition has been mounting attack on government over the amended citizenship law by calling it anti-Muslim, BJP has come up with a plan to use the legislation to consolidate its support base among Dalits in the state, considered a core vote bank of BSP.

Top BJP sources said the party has directed leaders and cadre to visit Dalit-dominated pockets and tell them that the citizenship law is in favour of SCs and STs who migrated to India after facing persecution in Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan.

BJP also plans to use the promulgation of the new citizenship law to win over educated youth ahead of elections for the 11 graduates’ and teachers’ constituency seats of the legislative council. Sources said the party seeks to neutralize the Opposition’s allegations accusing BJP of bringing a law against Muslims, Dalits and poor.

The saffron party has roped in its Dalit cadres in the drive, days after PM Narendra Modi said that most of the persecuted minorities in Paksitan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan belonged to lower castes.

UP BJP general secretary and in charge of the SC/ST Morcha, Govind Narayan Shukla confirmed that SC cadres will be part of the ongoing Jan Jagran campaign to remove any apprehensions among Dalits about the citizenship law.

He said, “The party has asked all its organisational wings to fan out across the state, essentially in violence-hit areas, for interactions.”

Some Dalits got swayed by the Opposition propaganda during anti-CAA protests, said another party leader. “Dalits and poor need to be told separately that there is nothing against them in the law,” he said.

UP BJP chief Swatantra Dev Singh and general secretary (organisation) Sunil Bansal will directly monitor the campaign through WhatsApp groups, said sources. Party functionaries have been asked to click photos of their meetings with different caste groups and upload them on the groups.

NASHIK: The rural police have arrested the youth who was on the run after accidently setting ablaze a 40-year-old woman in front of Lasalgaon bus stand on Saturday evening.

The woman sustained serious burns and was admitted to Nashik civil hospital. Sources in the civil hospital said that she had sustained 67% burns. She was shifted to a hospital in Mumbai late on Saturday night.

Police officers said her condition is still critical.

Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray and district guardian minister Chhagan Bhujbal had gone to see the woman at Nashik civil hospital on Saturday night. Superintendent of rural police Arti Singh had also rushed to the hospital to check the condition of the woman.

Police had lodged FIRs against the youth and two of his associates. Police officers investigating the case said, “We have arrested the youth from Yeola on Sunday. He claimed that he did not set the woman afire on purpose. He fled the spot as he got scared seeing the woman ablaze.” Two of the youth’s associates were already arrested on Saturday.

Police have recorded the statement of the victim, a widow, who admitted that the youth did not deliberately set her on fire.

As per preliminary investigation of the police, the woman, a resident of Lasalgaon, had secretly married the youth, also from the same locality, much to the opposition of his parents.

Tensions were brewing between the woman and the youth as the latter’s parents had finalised his marriage with another girl. The woman was allegedly trying to break the marriage.

Police have got hold of CCTV footage from a petrol pump which shows the woman buying a bottle of petrol and keeping it in her two-wheeler. “We have lodged an FIR against the manager and the staff at the petrol pump who handed over the bottle of petrol to the woman. It is illegal to sell petrol in bottles and jars,” said SP Singh.

Around 5pm on Saturday, the woman had an altercation with the youth about the latter’s marriage in front of Lasalgaon bus stand. Two of the youth’s friends were also there at the time of the altercation.

Police said that while the altercation was on, the woman took out the bottle containing petrol from the dickey of her two-wheeler and opened the cap. She wanted to pour the petrol in her vehicle which was on the verge of running out of fuel.

“When the youth saw the petrol bottle in her hand, he thought she was trying to set herself afire. He tried snatching the bottle and threatened to set himself on fire. During the scuffle, some of the petrol fell on the woman. The youth had ignited a matchstick to immolate himself, but accidentally the woman was set ablaze,”said police.

Illustration used for representational purpose.

BHUBANESWAR: The state government has asked district collectors to promptly constitute boards of visitors (BOVs), consisting members of the government and non-government officials, to inspect jails.

Although the Supreme Court had in September 2017 asked all states to form separate BOVs for jails, a number of districts in Odisha are yet to comply with the directive. Hearing a petition on the inhuman conditions in different prisons in the country, the Supreme Court had made it mandatory for states to form two separate BOVs for each jail . One board would consist of government officials headed by the district collector and the other would have non-government officials.

The state has 90 jails. Currently, only 14 jails have both BOVs, while 23 others have only the non-official BOV.

On February 12, the prisons directorate drew the attention of the state home department to the delay by some districts in complying with the Supreme Court’s directive. Subsequently, the home department asked the collectors to immediately notify lists of official and non-official BOVs.

DGP (prisons) Santosh Upadhyay said the BOV members could conduct surprise inspection in the jails. “The visitors will interact with the inmates and note down their complaints or grievances. The visitors will check the security, hygiene and food quality in jails. They can suggest reforms and welfare measures for prisoners,” Upadhyay said.

In tune with the state government’s 5T formula in governance, Upadhyay said efforts were being made for the expeditious completion of e-prisons system in the state. “We are working on database linking between courts and jails under the Crime and Criminal Tracking Network and Systems (CCTNS). It will show details of undertrial prisoners, convicts and their previous criminal antecedents,” Upadhyay said.

The prisons DGP said steps were also being taken to introduce technological innovation in jails through installation of CCTV cameras and procurement of mobile phone trackers. “We have asked jail superintendents to maintain transparency in procurement and quality monitoring of food materials. Surprise joints raids will be regularly conducted by police, jail personnel and magistrates,” he said.

Hardly 10 students got a seat after me. However, after joining medical college, I always secured either first or second rank and continued to do so even in my postgraduation,” said the VC of KNRUHS.He said that it is important to understand that every student will have a phase where he/she will excel in studies. “A student is a topper from class 1 to PG only in rarest of rare cases. Generally, one starts excelling in a field of study when they realize their passion,” he added.Giving a tip or two on how to present answers in examinations, he said that students should ensure that they highlight important points and do not write more than 16-17 lines in a page.“Students have to remember that most teachers who evaluate answer scripts are either in their 40s or 50s. If they write 30 lines in a page, it will be hard for evaluators to even read their answers. Use side headings, diagrams, flowcharts and present answers properly,” said Reddy adding that this is the main reason why a student who has comparatively less knowledge scores better than the one with better knowledge.The VC of KNRUHS said that students should concentrate on question papers of previous years as majority of the questions are repeated. “This is how I secured good marks in subjects like pharmacology and gynaecology,” he said. He advised students not to mug up answers from guides or question banks as writing the exact answers from them will give a wrong impression that a student has copied in the exam.He said that parents should ensure that their children are not using any kind of medication or caffeinated products to stay awake for long hours before the day of the exam. “Doing so will create confusion and they will not be able to concentrate,” he added.Reddy advised parents to not be over-attentive when it comes to their kid’s studies and added that there won’t be much difference whether a student scores 80% or 90% in an examination. He said that they should let the child relax once every hour for at least 10-15 minutes by playing videogames, reading comics, or playing games.",hyderabad,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74166280,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-113841,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/concentrate-on-presenting-the-answers-rather-than-mugging-up-knruhs-vc/articleshow/74166281.cms

The banks of the Cauvery, Trichy

TRICHY: Except for the recently-opened public parks, proposals to develop tanks and introduce boat rides were not taken up seriously by the urban civic body. Situated on the banks of the Cauvery , Trichy city is bestowed with several tanks that can be well developed into potential leisure zones. However, the stakeholders particularly, Trichy City Corporation, has not shown interest in redeveloping the tanks in the landlocked city.

Ponmalaipatti Mavadikulam and Sathanur Sengulam are among the tanks that can be potentially developed into recreational centres to serve the residents who are deprived of leisure spots. However, the tanks are neglected due to the lack of initiatives in utilising the waterbodies. The 36-acre Sengulam tank near KK Nagar was proposed to be beautified by the corporation and the district administration in 2018. The promises remain only on paper. Recently people started using the limited walking tracks at Anna Nagar Link Road and Racecourse Road. Residents will eventually reap the benefits if the bunds of major tanks were fortified to develop walking tracks. “The corporation should focus on creating recreational centres for the residents by redeveloping the tanks including Sathanur tank. Trichy city has not developed a proper recreational centre since 25 years,” Bahauddeen Abdullah, a 77-year-old resident of Khajanagar, said.

Mavadikulam sprawling across 142 acres was also once proposed to be beautified into a recreational spot. The proposal has not materialised so far. Mavadikulam tank is often visited by migratory water birds. If the tank was properly desilted and the bunds were strengthened, it would attract many people. Revival of boating service in Teppakulam tank near Rockfort is one of the long-pending demands of the local people. Authorities blamed the lack of cooperation between the stakeholders for the failure in beautifying the tanks. Trichy City Corporation is still working on to secure permissions from PWD to beautify the tanks. “We have a proposal to beautify at least six tanks maintained by us. For redeveloping the tanks belonging to PWD such as Mavadikulam and Sengulam, we have requested PWD to handover the tanks to us,” a senior official with the corporation said.

Jal Sansthan officials have been making temporary arrangements to stop the leakages. But no permanent solution has been worked on. The pipeline in the Trans-Yamuna locality has leaked 14 times in the past six months.

The areas where water supply remains affected on Sunday were Gandhi Nagar, parts of Kamla Nagar, Balkeshwar, Khandari, Jail Road, Nagla Padi, Radha Vihar, Astha city center, Trans-Yamuna, Shahganj, Belanganj, Daresi, Rawatpara, Noori Darwaza, Idgha and Awas Vikas, among others.

General Manager of Jal Sansthan, RS Yadav, said, “The leakage in the Trans-Yamuna locality has been temporarily fixed using rope. Here, a colour will be placed over the pipeline. Other minor leakages are also being repaired.”

According to sources, the frequent leakages in the pipeline mainly take place due to lack of proper checks and maintenance. Leakages in water supply pipelines maintained by Jal Sansthan are causing wastage of thousands of litres of water in different parts of the city on a daily basis.

According to an estimate, at least 50 million litres per day (MLD) of water is wasted in the city due to pipeline leakages. The number of leaks has only increased in the past two years. Till now, Jal Sansthan has no city-wide plan to check the situation.

Water supply in old city areas is dependent on Jeevani Mandi water works whereas nearly half of the city gets water supply from Sikandra water works. The pipelines connected to Jeevani Mandi water works are said to be in worst condition.

Civic body officials said a special squad was deployed for this drive

PUNE: The civic body has cracked the whip against encroachments that pop up on the road at night.

The action was a part of a three-day drive — from February 10 to 13 — against roadside encroachments, during which action was taken against 96 traders found operating in an unauthorized manner. Another drive will be held this week, officials said.

Pune Municipal Corporation officials said a special squad was deployed for this drive. The civic administration has initiated action against those operating illegal handcarts and other roadside vending outlets. Jammers were affixed on illegally parked buses and gas cylinders were confiscated from vendors preparing food on the road.

“The drive focused on illegal roadside vendors. Even those who are operating food carts on the road were covered. Action was also taken against private bus operators for parking their vehicles on the road and causing traffic jams,” Madhav Jagtap, head of PMC ’s anti-encroachment department, said.

As per PMC officials, the civic body has already started a drive to make 11 arterial roads free of hawkers. The drive is being conducted in association with the traffic department, and the night-time drive was part of this initiative.

Special focus is on areas with market places and heavy footfall, such as Laxmi Road, Fergusson College Road, Jangli Maharaj Road, Bajirao Road, Shivaji Road, Sinhagad Road, Karve Road, Kumthekar Road, Shastri Road, Tilak Road and Ahmednagar Road.

The PMC had announced that 45 major roads and 108 crossings would be free of hawking around a decade ago — a plan that has yet to materialize.

BHUBANESWAR: Following allegations of irregularities in the selection of examination centres for the annual higher secondary (Plus II) examination, the Council of Higher Secondary Education (CHSE) changed around 20 centres in an emergency meeting here on Sunday. The council has designated 1,142 centres for the Plus II exam.

Saluja, who is also a managing committee member of CHSE, said, “Colleges having no prior record of malpractice have been chosen as the new exam centres. We are hopeful that the annual exam this year will be conducted in a free and fair manner.”

Taking suo motu cognisance of the issue, the Odisha Human Rights Commission (OHRC) had asked the council to submit an explanation to the commission by February 18. “If there were no irregularities in the selection of exam centres, why did the council call an emergency meeting on Sunday to change the centres? There is more to the matter than what appears. We are also demanding that the council should disclose the names of the colleges with bad records and strict action must be taken against them,” said Basudev Bhatt, convener of OAM.

Pune: The city will experience a surge in day and night temperatures over the next few days, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) said on Sunday.

The daytime temperatures are already above the normal by two to three degrees celsius.

On Sunday, Pune and Lohegaon observatories recorded 33.6 degrees celsius and 33.9 degrees celsius as maximum temperatures which are above the normal by 2 and 0.9 degrees, respectively.

Similarly, night temperatures in Pune and Lohegaon recorded 15.7 and 17.2 degrees celsius above the normal by 3.7 and 3.2 degrees, respectively.

“The day and night temperature will be on the rise this week. The northerly winds are unable to reach Madhya Maharashtra region. As a result, the temperatures across the state will remain between 33 and 34 degrees celsius,” head of the forecast division of IMD, Pune, Anupam Kashyapi told TOI on Sunday.

From February 18, Kashyapi said, there could be partial clouding in the morning accompanied with haze. “Interaction between south and southwesterly winds will bring more moisture to the state,” he added.

The rising temperature, IMD sources said, is a conducive for killing deadly viruses which cannot sustain in more than 30 degrees celsius temperature.

The state is gradually going through a transition phase from winter to summer. “Summer in the state may begin from the last week of February,” Kashyapi added.

Barring one station in Marathwada and two in Vidarbha, all other stations in the four regions of the state have recorded a surge in daytime temperatures, IMD data show.

<p>ban on onion</p><p><br></p>

NASHIK: A delegation of farmers met chief minister Uddhav Thackeray on Sunday and sought his intervention on the rollback of the onion exports ban imposed by the Centre.

The chief minister was in Nashik on Sunday to address a gathering at the state lawyers’ conference organised by Maharashtra and Goa Bar Council. The delegation was led by the state president of Maharashtra Onion Growers’ Association Bharat Dighole.

“The price of wholesale onions has dropped at large due to rise in supply as compared to demand. If the supply continues to increase, the wholesale onion price may drop further and farmers may incur more losses,” Dighole said.

“Hence, there is a need to withdraw the ban on onion export. We have been demanding the Centre to withdraw the ban, but in vain. Hence, we want chief minister’s intervention in this. We met the CM and held short discussion, urging him to approach the central government. The CM has assured us to look into the issue,” he added.

Dighole said that price of onions in Bangladesh and Myanmar in the range of Rs 60 and Rs 70, while onions are being sold at Rs 15-20 per quintal in wholesale markets of India. “Hence, farmers will get the benefit if onion export begins,” he said.

Meanwhile, the average wholesale onion price at Lasalgaon APMC, country’s largest wholesale onion market, has stabilized at Rs 1,800 per quintal.

The average wholesale onion price has dropped by almost 80% in the past two months, from Rs 8,625 per quintal on December 16, 2019, to Rs 1,800 per quintal. Around 2.40 lakh quintals of onions have been auctioned so far in the last fortnight.

357,['17/02/2020'],UPSRTC to install 'Anti-Sleep Devices' to alert drowsy bus drivers,"This story is from February 17, 2020

AGRA: In a bid to reduce road accidents, especially at night, Uttar Pradesh State Road Transport Corporation (UPSRTC) is contemplating the introduction of a “drowsiness detection system” to check its drivers from dozing off at the wheels. Based on an Israeli technology, the ‘Anti Sleep Devices ’ will be installed in the premium segment buses, including Volvo, Scania and air-conditioned Janrath, in the first phase.

The sensor-equipped device will monitor the driver’s eye movements and sound a loud warning alarm in case the driver appears to be sleepy. In case, the driver does not respond to the alarm, the device will automatically send an SMS to the officials.

UPSRTC service manager SP Singh said, “The technology has been thoroughly checked in Lucknow. The performance of the device is found satisfactory on various parameters. Following the state government orders, installation of the ‘Anti Sleep Devices’ has been initiated. It will prove to be a significant step in ensuring the safety of the passengers.”

There have been several instances of drivers tending to ignore drowsiness and causing accidents, especially on long-distance journeys at night. “A warning will be issued if the driver is no longer in a condition to drive. This will ensure passengers’ safety as well,” said the service manager.

The camera of the device will capture facial expressions and process the signals using artificial intelligence. The system will also help UPSRTC analyze its drivers’ skills.

On Sunday, Jeetu Shukla, managing director of Secure Techno Hub, the company tasked to install the devices in the buses, said, “So far, the ‘Anti Sleep Devices’ has been installed in 25 buses, a majority of them operating on long distances. The devices have alerted the authorities about the drowsiness of the drivers on over a dozen occasions. Majority of these instances took place between 2 am and 5 am. With the device installed in the bus, there is no scope for accident due to driver falling asleep.”

Explaining the working of the device, Shukla said, “When a driver starts a bus, there will be a beep sound to ensure that the device is working. The device will record driver’s movement for two minutes. Then the driver’s activities will be monitored every second on four parameters. The major parameters include head movement, hands movement, alertness and drowsiness.”

“In case the device senses any alarming situation, it will immediately flash a light on the driver’s face. After five seconds, if the driver does not show any alertness, it would start a continuous beep sound. Even then, if the driver is not active, after five seconds, a hooter will make a loud noise, which will alert all passengers, and after five seconds, it will send a message directly to control room and the concerned officials,” Shukla added.

358,['17/02/2020'],Kolhapur: Tax dues waiver proposal to be discussed in general body meeting,"This story is from February 17, 2020

Representative image

KOLHAPUR: The proposal to waive off the fine over the water tax and property tax dues will come up for discussion in the general body meeting of Kolhapur Municipal Corporation (KMC) on Tuesday.

The corporators have urged the civic administration to waive the penalty charges completely if the defaulter is ready to pay the principal amount of dues in a single installment. The corporators claim that waiving the fine amount will help generate the revenue and achieve the revenue targets of both the departments.

A senior KMC official requesting anonymity said, “In 2017, we had waived the fine amount over the property tax dues. Many property owners availed the benefit, however many had sought to break the dues into installments which was not accepted. The waiver in the fine amount is a short-term measure for the recovery of the tax dues. We had requested by the corporators to draft the waiver proposal, however, we have made it clear that the waiver will not help much with respect to revenue generation. Moreover, it will lead to revenue loss in the long term.”

The official further states that the waiver scheme implemented in 2017 and that proposed one by the corporators are completely different. “In 2017, 50% of the fine amount over the defaulted amount was waived if the dues are paid in a single installment. Now, the corporators are seeking a 100% waiver in the fine or the penalty amount. Currently, both the departments are facing a tough task to achieve the revenue target. Both the departments have not yet achieved 50% of the revenue target while the financial year is coming to an end in the next one and half months.”

Owing to slow tax recovery, the salaries of the officials of both the departments were held for over a week this month. “We have been asked to keep a report ready showing the details of the tax collections of both these departments and the likely impact on the revenue after the waiver in fine and penalty amount is accepted,” said the official.

Brigadier GB Reddy (left) during his training days at Indian Military Academy

HYDERABAD: At 81, Brigadier GB Reddy remembers every bit of this stint in Nagaland as an officer of the Indian Army . It was a surgical strike that the Naga ultras were ill-prepared for. Army officer G B Reddy was hot on their pursuit.He went 18 km deep into Burma (Myanmar) and took the militants by surprise. He brought them back from across the border and handed them over to the military authorities. The entire episode was a matter of great pride. But it also came with a price.GB Reddy was injured during the operations. The separatist ultras shot at Reddy’s team and threw grenades. Reddy was injured and had to lie on his stomach in the hospital for two months. It took six months for him to recover. A deep injury mark under his buttocks region is testimony to the grueling pain he suffered. Even today, there is hardly any sensation in the pelvic region due to the injury. But G B Reddy has embraced his scars.Hailing from Anantapur in Andhra Pradesh, his father, a barrister practicing in London wanted one of his sons to join the army and G B Reddy was only too eager. “There never ever was a time that I thought about the dangers that I would face,” he said in a conversation with him at his Alwal residence in Secunderabad .In the 1962 war with China was a challenging time. “For five days, we survived by eating leaves,” he recalled. He was in a pit along the border in Arunachal Pradesh and saw the Chinese incursion. “I heard on the Army communication system Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru asking the Indian army to drive away the Chinese,” he said.In the 33 years that he was in the army, serving in Nagaland was one high point. He made friends with the Naga tribals providing them with better amenities. Reddy, an author of several books, has been invited for celebrations in the village this year, to commemorate the 30 years of the tribals coming down from the hills and benefiting from the amenities provided for them. Through his efforts, he also provided inputs that indicated the existence of the ULFA.Dealing with the LTTE’s dreaded top-rung leader Kittu was another high point in his career. Kittu was forcibly sent away to Jaffna by the Indian government but he would not get down the aircraft in Jaffna. The job was to present him to his people safely but Kittu who refused to go back there since he wanted to operate from India, proved difficult to handle. The LTTE leader would probably swallow a cyanide pill and this could have been counter-productive. “I spoke in Tamil and addressed Kittu in the aircraft in Jaffna. Using tact, I told him that they would fight for whatever cause they wanted if that was their conviction. But he would have to get down the aircraft and pose no problems,” Brig G B Reddy recalled.

Pune: For two hours from 9am on Sunday, vehicular movement on Pune-Bengaluru National Highway No 4 was almost at a standstill following picketing by more than 600 local residents at Khed-Shivapur toll plaza, about 26km from Pune.

They wanted the toll plaza shifted to another location.

The protest was called off after a temporary solution was worked out during a telephonic conversation between the activists, who led the stir, and the Union minister for transport Nitin Gadkari.

“Two lanes on either sides of the toll plaza will be open for local residents to drive through without paying any toll for the next eight days,” NCP’s Baramati MP Supriya Sule said.

Sule, Bhor and Khadakwasla MLAs Sangram Thopte and Bhimrao Tapkir brokered the telephonic conversation during a meeting with the activists at the National Highways Authority of India’s (NHAI) office adjacent to the toll plaza. NHAI, district and rural police officials and representatives of the toll plaza operator were present.

Sule told the protesters and mediapersons that Gadkari, who was to board a flight to Sweden from Delhi, agreed to meet the protesters on his return for a solution. “Till then, the NHAI and other authorities have agreed not to collect toll for the next eight days from residents from Haveli, Bhor, Purandar, Velhe and Mulshi talukas of Pune district,” she said.

A senior NHAI officer, who did not wish to be named, confirmed that two lanes on either sides of the toll booth will remain open for local residents to drive through without paying any toll for the next eight days. The FastTag facility on these lanes will be shut, he added.

The officer said, “We will follow directions from the central government on the Khed-Shivapur toll issue. We have requested the road maintenance company to expedite repairs and construct the bridges for local vehicles.”

Residents from villages around Khed-Shivapur want the toll plaza shifted as they use a 15km to 20km stretch of the highway every day, but pay toll.

“We want exemption from paying toll and the toll plaza shifted out of the Pune Metropolitan Regional Development Authority limits,” Uttam Darwatkar said. He heads the Shivapur Toll Naka Hatao Kruti Samiti which had called the protest.

The company, which maintains the highway section, has neglected the road for many years. There are huge potholes and there are no diversion boards, especially on the stretch between Khed-Shivapur and Shirwal, he added.

“There are no service roads for local villagers. Many travel every day to Pune for business and private purposes and pay toll. We will decide the next step after we meet the Union minister in Delhi. If our demands are not met, we will launch a stronger agitation,” he added.

Sule said their grievance is fair and an all-party committee will look into their issues. “If we give services, better roads and facilities, then people are willing to pay. A policy change is required which only the Union government can do. We will take up with Gadkariji,” she added.

A toll booth operator told TOI that NHAI officials and policy makers will decide about the toll. Superintendent of Pune rural police Sandeep Patil monitored the situation. A strong police bandobast was deployed to avert any fallout of the agitation.

Aurangabad: In a state-level annual conference organised on Sunday, international orthopaedic specialists informed the doctors about advanced treatment modalities for injuries around the knee joints.

Around 250 delegates, including doctors and PG medical students from different parts of Marathwada, attended the programme.

The Jalna Orthopaedic Association and Aurangabad Orthopaedic Association had jointly organised the conference, Meet the Masters 2020.

It is organised in different cities of the state every year.

The experts said that earlier, knee fracture required installation of plate or rod for treatment. However, now, the knee fracture treatment is possible with minimum incision, therefore, faster recovery with less risk.

Former president of Maharashtra Orthopaedic Association Yashwant Gade said that the conference will help in propagating the advanced methods of treatment in Marathwada.

Rajan Udhan of organising committee said, “The highly specialised faculty discussed how complicated trauma around the knee joint can be treated in minimum cost with minimal invasion. The experts suggested the apparatus that can be used to carry out the surgical procedures. They guided on how the tools can be used for improvised treatment.”

Videos and presentations of case studies were shown to explain the successful use of advanced techniques in the conference.

The chief organiser of the programme Prakash Sigedar said that it is not possible for local surgeons to go for training programmes in other countries to learn various kinds of techniques for treatments every time.

Civic chief Mallinath Kalshetti

KOLHAPUR: Civic chief Mallinath Kalshetti on Sunday said that the process to mark hawking and no-hawking zones across the city will begin soon.

Speaking to TOI, Kalshetti said the drive to clear major roads from encroachments has already begun.

“I along with other officials visited Hubli-Dharwad Municipal Corporation to study implementation of the hawking and no-hawking zones there. Based on our findings we are going to clear the major roads of encroachment first and then after taking the hawker associations in confidence, we will mark the hawking and no-hawking zones. Though we have not set specific a deadline to initiate markings of the zones, the citizens will soon start witnessing the difference,” Kalshetti said.

Recently, the corporators had raised the issue of increased number of hawkers in the city causing inconvenience to both commuters and the locals. The corporators claimed that leaders of the hawker associations obstruct action stating that there is no hawking policy in place and therefore no action can be taken against the hawkers.

Activists, too, have several times alleged that the hawkers are allowed to do business in particular locality at the behest of the local corporators. The corporators in the recent standing committee meeting had claimed that they are blamed for increase in number of hawkers and refuted the allegations.

Pandit Powar, head of anti-encroachment department, said, “In HDMC, the hawkers and vendors have been rehabilitated to open spaces. We lack such space for rehabilitation. We can adopt the model of Pune where along the Laxmi Road, grills have been put up along wide road and hawkers are allowed to do their business there. We expect that the declaration of the legal hawkers will be made by the estate department after which the process of marking the zones will start.”

He added that the higher authorities have been suggested to ban heavy vehicles from plying along the approaching roads to Mahalaxmi temple to manage the hawkers.

The estate department is going to form a committee with representatives from the hawker association and other experts to mark the zones.

In view of the upcoming elections, the office-bearers are in two minds over approving the proposal.

In its meeting on Thursday, the standing committee discussed the proposal. The members raised questions on AMC’s tax recovery process. Member Raju Shinde said deputation of contractual staff for tax recovery is not wise. AMC’s sanitation inspectors and supervisors should instead do this work.

NASHIK: To collect maximum property tax in the first quarter of the financial year 2020-21, the Nashik Municipal Corporation (NMC) has decided to introduce up to 5% incentive on prompt payment of the property tax bills. They will get another 1% rebate if they pay online.

Those who pay their annual tax in April will get 5% rebate in the tax amount while 3% and 2% tax rebates will be given those those who pay taxes in May and June, respectively.

The municipal corporation has taken this initiative to encourage people to pay property tax in the first three months of the financial year.

The concession in property taxes was stopped during the last financial year by the then municipal commissioner Tukaram Mundhe. However, it was re-introduced by current municipal commissioner Radhakrishna Game.

“The NMC may collect maximum revenue in the first quarter of the financial year if we give incentives to prompt tax payers. Now, the incentive schemes would be into effect from the beginning of the new financial year,” an NMC official said.

In 2018-19, the civic body had collected property tax amounting to Rs 112 crore. It was for the first time that the NMC’s property tax collection target had touched Rs 100 crore.

In 2019-20, the municipal corporation had set a target of Rs 218 crore. By February 15, the NMC had collected property tax amounting to Rs 137 crore as against Rs 98 crore collected during the same period last financial year 2018-19.

The municipal corporation has already decided to auction the properties of major defaulters. In the first phase, properties of 89 tax defaulters are to be auctioned on February 26 at the Dadasaheb Gaikwad auditorium in the city.

“There are 1.92 lakh tax defaulters having dues ranging from Rs 4,000 to Rs 1 lakh. We have served notices to around 1.80 lakh property tax defaulters, asking them to clear their dues immediately,” an NMC official said.

372,['17/02/2020'],Vacancies in teaching posts in Koraput central varsity may not be filled up soon,"This story is from February 17, 2020

Koraput: The long wait of the Central University of Odisha to get its teaching posts filled up is going to be longer.

The picturesque varsity, situated in the lap of nature at Sunabeda in Koraput district, has the dubious distinction of being a university in the county to not have a professor.

The Centre-run university has only 17 full-time teachers — an associate professor and 16 assistant professors — for its 14 departments. The sanctioned teaching post strength is 154.

An inquiry revealed that in February 2017, the CUO had advertised for 65 posts of teaching staff and at least 4,000 applicants from across the country had applied for them.

However, quashing the earlier advertisement, the varsity invited applications for 81 teaching posts, including 14 posts of professors, 25 posts of associate professors and 42 posts of assistant professors, on August 2019 but no headway has taken place till now, said a teacher.

Eleven years since its establishment, the CUO has been brought down on its knees by the acute shortage of teaching staff. “But the authorities are not bothered about it,” said Jeypore MLA Tara Prasad Bahinipati.

The Congress legislator alleged that as last year the CUO’s issue was raised by Koraput MP Saptagiri Ulaka in Parliament and he had written to the Union HRD ministry to take necessary steps to fill up the vacant teaching posts, the varsity had advertised for posts to pacify activists, seeking filling up of posts.

Due to the staff shortage, the university has opened only 14 departments against the 20 it was sanctioned.

The varsity authorities said adequate steps have been taken to ensure that academic activities are not hampered and efforts are on to recruit adequate number of teaching staff.

“We have appointed 12 visiting professors from across the county and 20 guest faculties to ensure that quality of education is not hampered,” said newly-joined VC of CUO I Ramabrahmam.

“Steps are being taken to fill up the vacant teaching posts,” he added.

Ramabrahmam joined the CUO in December 2019 after the varsity ran for over nine months by an in-charge VC. The CUO was set up by an Act of Parliament on August 29, 2009.

Work on the park is on in full swing at Professors’ Colony

Bhopal: Adding three more letters to an approval, funds for development of ‘park’ are being utilised by the civic body for a ‘parking’ slot. The development is taking place within prohibited development zone, as demarcated by the National Green Tribunal (NGT) within 50 meter of a water body along the Lower Lake in Bhopal.

“There will be a small park in the middle. Alongside the boundary vehicles can be parked. It will ease traffic situation for those visiting Ravindra Bhawan or Swaraj Bhawan,” said BMC zone 5 civil works in charge, P K Jadia.

The work is funded under the Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation (AMRUT) — a union government scheme. Main head of this funding is for ‘development of green open spaces’ and ‘new parks’. It does not include creation of urban concrete and development of parking areas.

The location is adjacent to the main road near Ravindra Bhawan touching the Lower Lake. The controversial development is within 50 metre of the water body, which is part of the UNESCO Ramsar site.

Over the past few days, heavy machinery has been used for the development. The green has witnessed construction of cemented pillars. Pits have been dug around nine humongous trees, that can directly affect the green cover.

City engineer, P K Jain said a consultant from the BMC is on site. BMC officials on the spot are still calling the facility a park, but the adventurous digging in the area point at a larger plan. BMC officials also indicated that the area along the lower lake would also witness the construction of a sewage treatment plant. Local residents have raised objections over the development of parking in the green zone.

The apprehended fishermen and their trawlers were escorted to Northern Naval Command.

Around 1,000 fishermen from Kottaipattinam and Jegathapattinam had ventured into the sea in 350 mechanized boats on Saturday.

After a medical check-up, all the fishers were handed over to the assistant director of Fisheries, Jaffna, through the department of coastal conservation for onward legal action. The seized trawlers have been anchored near the Northern Naval Command.

As the information was passed on to their relatives, they have complained with the directorate of fisheries department. Coastal Security Group has commenced enquiry into the incident, sources said.

Aurangabad: In a letter addressed to the district women and child development officer, activists in the city have sought the formation of a committee to address the issues of women working in the unorganised sector in the cantonment.

They said a mechanism should be devised keeping in mind the law drafted to ensure women’s safety at workplace.

Referring to the Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act, 2013, the cantonment Jan Adhikar Manch (CJAM) said that the establishment must provide safe working environment for women in the unorganised sector in Aurangabad Cantonment.

CJAM is an NGO formed by the residents of seven cantonments in Maharashtra working for the development of the residents since 2011.

Savita Jadhav, a member of CJAM advisory committee, said that the NGO has been working on various issues, including malnutrition, education, implementation of Right to Education Act, gender equality through handling women violence cases, national health policy, development of children with disabilities as well as pursuing the demand for anganwadi centres in cantonment.

“While working for gender equality and safe working environment, we found there is no mechanism to address issues of women working in the unorganised sector and residing in cantonment. There is a local complaints committee (LCC) at the district level but it is far from the workplace of the women residing in cantonment. Therefore, it becomes necessary to create a system in cantonment with the support of the administration,” Jadhav said.

The NGO, in its letter to the district women and child development officer, said that a safe working environment will allow women to contribute to the development of their family. CJAM activist Laxman Deshmukh said that the LCC is located at the district collectorate, and, if any woman has a complaint, she cannot afford to go to the district collectorate for a solution.

Aurangabad: The Aurangabad city police — probing the state’s first case of cheque cloning — have arrested the second suspect, identified as Shivaji Thombre.

The suspect is a politician from Gadhejalgaon in Aurangabad rural.

The two suspects, Bhagwan Muley of Karmad and Thombre, were produced before the holiday court on Sunday and have been remanded in 5-day police custody.

Moreover, the role of a suspect from Vasmat has come to the fore. A police team has been sent to arrest him.

Investigation officer and assistant inspector Ghanshyam Sonawne said many startling facts are emerging now. “The entire racket works in a very sophisticated manner. We are interested in finding out the source of these cloned cheques and the people forging the signatures of the actual account holders.”

The officer said that an amount of Rs 97, 000 was recently withdrawn similarly, while another cloned cheque of Rs 78 lakh is pending before the bank for clearance.

The investigation has revealed that Thombre along with his close aide (the man from Vasmat) had purchased material worth Rs 10 lakh from Muley, who apart from being an influential sarpanch, has several businesses in Karmad and surrounding areas.

The duo handed over a cloned cheque of Rs 16 lakh (with the forged signature of Bablu Laxman Hari of Bhagalpur) to Muley and asked him to get the amount transferred to his own bank account.

The suspects asked Muley to deduct the outstanding amount and hand over the remaining Rs 6 lakh to them.

Thombre and the man from Vasmat have been working closely with another suspect from Vidarbha. This Vidarbha man, through his contact in banks, would obtain details of accounts not linked with mobile phone numbers and misuse them.

Authorities said the role of some hardened criminals on police record too is being scanned.

Meanwhile, sources in the police commissionerate maintained that with the arrest of those closely associated with some politicians from the region, the probe is turning out to be an uphill task for the police.

It is a first-of-its-kind initiative in CR

Pune: The Pune rail division is all set to roll-out state-of-the-art ‘digital’ mobile charging stations at the railway station.

The facility is aimed at improving passenger amenities and experience at the station. The move also effectively brings to an end the days when passengers would hunt for charging points.

“This is a first-of-its-kind initiative in Central Railway. Pune is probably the second division in the country, after Ahmedabad, to install these machines,” an official told TOI.

As per officials, each machine is equipped with 24 small, digitally secure lockers in which phones can be stored while charging. The easy-to-use machines are equipped with a touchscreen interface, using which users can “rent” a locker for Rs10 per hour. “Users will be told to select the number of hours they want to charge a phone and insert the requisite amount to unlock a locker equipped with a charging cable. The machine prints out a slip with a bar code. When the user wants to remove their phone, they must scan this bar code, only after which the locker will unlock,” the official explained.

Another official said this system was secure and that there was no chance a phone could be stolen.

Railway officials said they would install more such machines at five stations — Shivajinagar, Pimpri, Chinchwad, Kolhapur and Miraj — soon. Each of these stations will have two machines each.

“I think it is a good initiative. Charging phones while in the stations is a challenging task. While most of the electrical switches don’t work, one needs to keep a close eye while the phone is getting charged. These machines are unique, but then the authorities still need to keep an eye. And paying up a little amount for the service shouldn’t be a problem for most,” Rishabh Gotre, a frequent passenger, said.

Cherlapally station

HYDERABAD: The plan to develop Cherlapally station as a satellite terminal is running behind schedule. To ease the passenger load on the existing three railways stations in the city – Secunderabad , Kacheguda and Nampally – a plan was envisaged in 2016 to build 10 platforms. However, it seems a distant reality due to land hurdles and funding issues.

“Our aim was to redevelop the station in an area of 250 acres. However, with only 50 acres available, we would be able to build only four more platforms, taking the total number of platforms to six,” said a South Central Railway (SCR) official, adding, “With an increase in the daily count of passengers and the frequency of trains at Secunderabad, Kacheguda and Nampally, Cherlapalli was sought as an alternative on the outskirts of the city.”

Officials said that the initial plan in 2016 was to build 10 platforms at a cost of Rs 150 crore to Rs 200 crore by adopting eco-friendly measures that were used in Secunderabad railway station. In the recent budget, Rs 5 crore was allotted to the project.

Gajanan Mallya, general manager, SCR, and divisional railway managers visited the station to review the work on Saturday. Sources said though work is going on, if the state government agrees to allot more land, they can return to their actual plan. Officials allege that Rs 100 crore was promised by the state to redevelop the station but there has been no response on that front.

“It is not just about redeveloping the station with facilities. Unless the said number of platforms are not built, it would not serve the purpose,” said a member of South Central Railway Mazdur Union (SCRMU).

The division bench of Justice Manojit Bhuyan and Justice Parthivjyoti Saikia made the observation in the case of Munindra Biswas , who had filed a writ petition challenging the decision of a foreigners tribunal to declare him a foreigner last July. Biswas had claimed that he was Indian by birth and a permanent resident of Margherita town of Tinsukia district . He submitted the voters’ list of 1997, which includes his name, as proof of his citizenship.

According to Biswas, his grandfather hailed from Nadia district of West Bengal and his father migrated from there to Assam in 1965 and settled in Tinsukia. The petitioner submitted to the tribunal a registered sale deed for a plot of land purchased by his father in Tinsukia in 1970, but the tribunal refused to accept that as proof of the latter being a resident of Assam.

The high court observed that since no voters’ lists prior to 1997 were submitted by the petitioner, the tribunal was right in deducing that he failed to prove his parents entered Assam prior to January 1, 1966 (the first cut-off in the accord).

“Regarding electoral photo identity card, the court in the case of Md Babul Islam versus state of Assam (2016) had held that a photo identity card is not a proof of citizenship,” the bench said.

KOLHAPUR: A 27-year-old man was killed by a bison while he was in his sugarcane field at Pohale village in Panhala taluka on Saturday.

A case in the regard has been registered with Kale police station. According to police, the deceased, Tanaji Dnyanu Narke, left his house on Saturday evening to guard his sugarcane field.

“Incidents of bison entering the sugarcane fields have increased in the last one month. After sunset, the bison gather in herd and move towards the fields located near forest area and damage the standing crops especially sugarcane,” a police officer said

When Narke did not return home till late night, his family members started searching for him. “When the family members rushed to the farm, they found Narke lying in a pool of blood. They realised that he was attacked by the bison who he might have tried to stop from entering the field,” he added.

Police was informed about the incident and a team soon rushed to the spot to conduct the panchnama. “Marks on the body indicate that he was attacked by the bison. We informed the forest department officials who rushed to the spot on Saturday night and completed the formalities,” the officer said.

“As bison are damaging our standing crops we have no option but to stand guard at the fields. Every evening, we try to stop bison from entering our fields by making noise or diverting their attention. We expect the forest department to take action on keeping a check on bison entering our fields,” a villager from Pohale village said.

The 40-acre fort hosts descendants of the famous warrior Tanahji Malusare and others from Chhatrapati Shivaji ... Read More

KOLHAPUR: Residents of Pargad, a fort located around 140 km south of Kolhapur on the Maharashtra-Goa border, have complained of rise in hooligans and nuisance over last few weeks.

The 40-acre fort hosts descendants of the famous warrior Tanahji Malusare and others from Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj’s army.

Manohar Bhalekar, a resident, wrote to the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) on January 27. In his complaint, Bhalekar said, “This fort was built by Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj and people have been residing on this fort since several decades. It is located on the border of Karnataka, Goa, and Maharashtra. This fort was built to keep vigilance on Portuguese and other enemies.”

“After the death of Tanhaji Malusare, fort Pargad was handed over to Raiba Malusare (son of Tanhaji). He, along with a few families from Pune (including Bhalekar family), went to Pargad and lived there,” the letter read.

According to Bhalekar, sometimes, mischief-mongers create nuisance in the area. Instances of people drinking and creating trouble in and around the fort area has increased in the recent times, especially after the release of the recent film on Tanhaji.

Bhalekar said that when the hooligans are stopped from creating nuisance, they often misbehave with the residents. The nearest police station is in Chandgad, about 33 km away from the fort. Also, the unavailability of police transport hinders the officials from making frequent visits to the fort.

He told TOI, “We want a police chowki (outpost) in the fort premises to ensure safety of the residents.”

Bhalekar said that his complaint’s cognizance was taken by the India Tourism, Mumbai, of the Ministry of Tourism, Union government.

“They have asked the principal secretary of the tourism department of the state to look into the matter,” he said.

When contacted, Abhinav Deshmukh, superintendent of police, Kolhapur, said that although the demand of Pargad residents is valid, erecting a permanent police outpost is not possible at the said location. It will be wastage of manpower.

“The volume of tourists at the said fort is not very high. The problems created by hooligans are just temporary, especially because of the release of the film. To handle the situation created due to hooligans, we can train the residents, especially youths,” he said.

He added that they will train the youths and will discuss the matter with the residents accordingly.

NAGPUR: The Nagpur division of Central Railway (CR) will earn Rs4 lakh revenue annually for tying up with the HCG-Nagpur Cancer Hospital and Research Institute (NCHRI) to create awareness regarding the disease among it’s passengers. The collaborative campaign kicked off on February 4, on the occasion of ‘ World Cancer Day ’.

The latest agreement between CR and HCG-NCHRI is the 22nd one this year in the category of ‘innovative contracts’. These have helped the division garner revenue of Rs47 lakh till February 15, which is the highest non-fare revenue earned by any division across India. It’s learnt many of the concepts in Nagpur division’s innovative contracts, which benefit the passengers and also add value to their journeys, have been replicated by other divisions too.

The under construction e-lobby in the building of Divisional Railway Manager (DRM) too would be the first of it’s kind innovation in the passenger amenities, where ATM facilities, passbook printing and such other banking solutions would be available. “We will also have fitness and wellness centre or Rail Saloon on platform number one along with a free gym facility for passengers,” said assistant commercial manager (goods) SG Rao.

“We have already added several first time ideas in the Indian Railway this year, like smart mobile-cum-luggage lockers, vehicle mounted ATM by Punjab National Bank , health ATM with facilities like blood and pressure tests, and so on,” he said.

The cancer awareness campaign posters would be visible in trains between Nagpur-Amla-Betul-Chhindwara, services between Nagpur-Rewa and Ajni-Lokmanya Tilak Terminus. The mirror glasses, toilets, doors, windows and other places in the coaches would have cancer related posters. The luggage rakes too have been earmarked for campaign purposes.

The credit for Nagpur division catapulting to the top slot in the non-fare revenue generation can be attributed to commercial inspector Taraprasad Acharya under DRM Somesh Kumar Shrivastav, and senior divisional commercial manager Krishnath Patil. “The commercial team’s performance in Nagpur division of CR has not only benefited the railways in terms of revenue generation, but passengers too got several innovative facilities to add value to their tickets purchased for journeys,” said Rao.

Among the other innovative facilities added include a rail nail art and mehndi centre in the ladies waiting hall, which too was opened in partnership with a private brand. “We are also generating revenue through floor branding, loco branding, bike packing outsourcing, 3D hologram display and advertising facilities on rolling stock,” said Rao.

Kallikudi integrated market

TRICHY: It is official; the district administration has confirmed that Kallikudi integrated market will not be utilised for what it was built for -- relocating vegetable market from the heart of the city. The integrated market on the city outskirts will be utilized by Farmers Producers Organisations (FPO) and self-help group (SHG) women to market their products after value-addition. The alternative plan was proposed after the traders at the Gandhi market stuck to their decision not to move to the new facility.

The integrated vegetable market was established at Kallikudi on the Trichy-Madurai NH at an estimated cost of Rs 77 crore and was inaugurated after several rounds of structural modification in June 2018. Since then, the 10-acre market built with the financial support of Nabard is laying vacant. As the Gandhi market traders were adamant on their decision, the state government has chalked out a plan to utilize the facility for marketing the products of farmers who are part of collective farming. State chief secretary K Shanmugam, who inspected Kallikudi market on Saturday, asked the district administration to use the integrated market for FPOs and SHGs. FPOs comprising farmers producers groups (FPG) who practice mixed horticulture farming and SHGs who are into value addition process will be invited to use the integrated market complex for their activities, sources said.

""Gandhi market traders will not be forced to occupy the integrated vegetable market complex,"" an official source said. The district administration has made it clear that it will not invest further in the Kallikudi market. The modified shops will be allocated to farmers and SHG women. ""Banana farmers in Thottiyam, who are involved in banana value addition production, are keen to occupy the integrated market. We will initiate steps to use the market facility at the earliest,"" an official source said. Since the facility has a 2,000-MT cold storage unit, the district administration said that they are confident of persuading the FPOs, FPGs and SHGs to utilize the facility.

HYDERABAD: There has been a gradual increase in the list of trees exempted from Telangana Forest Produce Transit Rules, making their felling and transportation hassle-free. This has sparked consternation among green activists.As per a recent government order (GO), the number of trees that can be felled has increased to 44 in 2018 from 40 in 2017 and about 20 in 2016. The order revisited the list of trees exempted from Telangana Forest Produce Transit Rules, 1970, and included four more trees to the already existing 40.The GO stated that farmers of Wanaparthy, Warangal and Janagaon had requested the government to include neem, Acacia species, naavi and neredu species as they were facing problems for transportation and obtaining transit permits for trees grown in their own fields. “Government, after careful examination of the matter and taking into consideration the request of the farmers, decided to include the four species in Schedule-II under Rule 16 of Telangana Forest Produce Transit Rules, 1970, in addition to the existing species,” the GO read.However, experts said that inclusion of more trees in the exempted species list will only strip the forests of green cover. “A lot of these species are becoming extinct because we are allowing them to be cut. Whether it is an exempted species or not, same rules should be applied for both types and no tree should be felled without proper inspections and permission of the competent authority,” said MM Hussain, vice-chairman of Hyderabad Nurseries Consortium and former general secretary of Indian Nurserymen Association.Environmentalists and botanists believe that this will give more freedom to smugglers to cut down trees. “Species such as timber and bamboo, known for their high commercial value, are also included in the exempted species list. This should not be allowed,” said Dr Mohan Rao, a botanist.Poojari Venkateshwarulu, divisional forest officer of Hyderabad, said, “There were comparatively less species in the exempted list earlier because we wanted to strictly regulate it. When people are facing difficulties in taking permissions, especially for species that they are growing in their own fields, they ask for relaxation. If the regulation is very strict, they will stop growing trees in their farmlands. If we want them to continue growing trees, we must consider their requests.”",hyderabad,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74168778,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-515174,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/greens-have-axe-to-grind-more-trees-to-fall/articleshow/74166316.cms

KOLHAPUR: Indicating that the home department will take strict action against those breaking rules in the Kalamba jail , minister of state for home (Rural) Shambhuraje Desai said that those involved in crimes such as ganja trade, supplying mobile phones or other materials to prisoners will not be spared.

“We are keeping a watch on activities taking place in the Kalamba jail. A committee has been already set up by the jail administration to look into the irregularities reported in the last few months. Also, the officials concerned must check if the officers or employees attached with the jail are responsible for the act. We will initiate strict action against those found guilty of being involved in supplying ganja and mobile phones to criminals serving term in the jail, “he said.

Flaws in the Kalamba jail security have surfaced several times in the last few years, raising questions on the administration of the prison. Incidents such as murder, ganja trade have rocked the Kalamba jail in the past. Also, a video clip recording from jail went viral on social media.

In 2015, two jail superintendents from the Kalamba Central Prison were suspended after a video of merrymaking at the jail went viral. The video that went viral on November 23, 2015, showed five jail inmates cooking food, eating dry fruits and allegedly smoking marijuana.

In 2018, a clip posted on social media showed a prisoner holding a pistol made of cardboard in his barrack in Kalamba jail. Moreover, an inmate named Sunil Mane who was arrested under the Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act (MCOCA), was found dead in the jail premises in May 2019.

To curb such incidents in the future, a special committee has been set up to look into the irregularities in the jail premises. The report of the committee is awaited.

Aurangabad: Two men have been booked by the city police for allegedly duping city-based trader of Rs 22 lakh

The complainant in the case had moved court after police failed to take cognizance of his complaint and register an offence.

After the court issued directives earlier this week, the Kranti Chowk police registered a case under various sections of the Indian Penal Code, including 420 (cheating), 406 (criminal breach of trust) and 120-B (criminal conspiracy).

According to the complaint registered by 48-year old Nafees Khan, a city-based ready-made cloth trader, he had come in touch with the suspected duo in January 2016, who had claimed of owning readymade dresses manufacturing unit.

They offered to provide all the ready-made cloths at comparatively cheaper rates. In addition to this, the suspects proposed Khan to invest in their manufacturing unit and assured him of giving 25% of the profit margin. They even gave lucrative offers including that on investment in their manufacturing unit, they will bear the power bills, rent of the shop as well as salary of one of the staffers of the shop at Aurangabad.

After a lot of consideration, Khan transferred Rs 21.92 lakh to the suspects’ bank account between October 2017 and May 2018. While taking money from him, the suspects even offered to bear half of the transportation expenses of the readymade cloths that would be sent from Bengaluru.

The suspects at the time of receiving the money to their bank accounts assured the complainant of signing a written agreement at the time of inaugurating the new readymade cloth shop. Much to Khan’s surprise, the suspects only supplied him Rs 4.06 lakh worth of ready cloths and stopped further supply. Later they even avoided signing an agreement with him.

Agitated over the sudden stoppage of cloths, he started contacting the suspects, who initially gave evasive replies and later even stopped answering his phone calls.

Worried over their behaviour, the trader rushed to Bengaluru, but they avoided meeting him too. Failing to get any response, he lodged a complaint with the police, who too delayed in the registration of offence, following which he reached out to the court.

Vyas presented raag Yaman with Ghate supporting him with powerful bol of tabla in teen taal. Vyas then changed the route with beautiful raag Kirwani and produced mellifluous ear-pleasing music.

It was a pleasing sight to watch the foursome performing the fusion with perfection.

393,['17/02/2020'],"Hang gliding pioneer, adventure junkie… 75-year-old still seeks the adrenaline rush","This story is from February 17, 2020

Vivek Mundkur needs a new salve for his restiveness every few years. A man drawn to creativity, adventure and extremes, the 75-year-old retired Army lieutenant colonel has built and flown hang gliders, gone windsurfing, cruised the Khadakwasla lake in a sailboat and hovercraft, reduced his electricity bills to zero with a windmill and solar panels, irrigated fields with his solar pumps and carved furniture at home.

The drive to follow through on a seemingly wild idea saw Mundkur virtually pioneer hang gliding as a sport in India. He built his first glider in the workshop of the College of Military Engineering at Dapodi in 1975 after referring to an article in ‘Popular Mechanics’ magazine. He bought aluminium pipes from Bohri Aali, welded them to make a triangular shape and covered his 20-foot-wide, 15-foot-long “flying machine” with tarpaulin. He spent Rs 1,500 on this glider, which was more than his monthly salary then.

Next, Mundkur took the glider up the Dighi hill, cleared rocks and stones on a descent path and attached himself to the contraption with an old parachute harness. Running a few metres down with the glider would give him a lift of one or two feet. Slowly, he began his descent from higher and higher up the hill, eventually getting a lift of around 400 feet and flying for one or two minutes.

An elated Mundkur invited his paratrooper friends from the Indian Air Force for a demonstration, but they punctured his exuberance by dubbing his glider a “stupid experiment”. Unfazed, he invited his general for another demonstration, only to be questioned by the top officer on whether he had insured himself and why he was being flippant about the precious gift of life. However, the general sent a message to the chief of the Corps of Engineers in New Delhi and the latter, himself a paratrooper and fanatical about flying, dispatched Mundkur for a six-week hang gliding course to the UK.

A trained Mundkur returned with three hang gliders, each costing around 700 pounds then, and started India’s first hang gliding club at the CME. He ran the club from 1979 to 1982, coaching around 90 army personnel and civilians. He also built more gliders at one-tenth the cost of the foreign ones. The club shut after he was posted out, but he later trained a bunch of hang gliding pilots at the Artillery School , Devlali. The school today has around 30-40 gliders and has the only hang gliding club in the country.

After retiring from the Army in 1989, Mundkur bought a two-seater hang glider from which he would do aerial photography. But hang gliding was slowly yielding space to paragliding. So he took to paragliding and later attached a paramotor backpack to his glider to keep him airborne for at least an hour and feed his photography passion. The paramator has a two-stroke engine with a propeller behind the paraglider. It simply takes you in the direction you want, though it detracts from the gliding charm of seeking thermals to stay in the air.

Mundkur gave up flying in 2003, focusing on making furniture single-handedly for his bungalow at Khadakwasla. Power disruptions were frequent in the area, so he first built a windmill and later installed solar panels to virtually eliminate his dependence on the electricity grid. He also got into making solar pumps, which won him a Greenpeace award. His pumps helped irrigate fields in UP, Bihar and West Bengal where farmers lacked the money to buy diesel for their motors. One of his windmills, a 1,400W wind-solar combination, was installed on the top of the Komic monastery in Spiti valley at an altitude of 15,000 feet.

Mundkur never abandoned adventure though and would regularly be seen on his windsurfer or sailboat on the Khadakwasla lake. Always the innovator, he mounted the engine of his motorized hang glider on an aluminium boat hull to create a propeller-driven airboat, the kind that is seen in the movies zipping over marshy areas in Florida. Next, he converted the airboat into a hovercraft by putting an inflatable tube around it.

But Mundkur’s urge to fly is supreme and he has got back to paragliding since last month. Training in the hills around Kamshet, he has soared the ridge for a good 40 minutes twice in the last fortnight. His intention is to learn so well that he can glide around the hills in Panchgani, where flyers experience some really strong winds. Indeed, Mundkur challenges the stereotype of senior living and epitomizes the maxim, “It’s not how old you are, it’s how you are old.”

MEERUT: Soon, Meerut will get a fully equipped modern vehicle fitness checking centre. Vehicles will be checked both by machines as well as manually. The machines will check a vehicle for emissions, speedometer, gear, rear view mirror, brakes, steering, reflective tape, silencer, spark plug, dashboard equipment and other aspects.

A three-acre plot has been identified in Partapur area for setting up the facility. Now, a nod from the district magistrate is pending to give the go-ahead in the matter.

“There are times when we get complaints that the fitness of the vehicle was either given a nod or rejected due to biased attitude of the official concerned. These allegations and malpractices, if any, become very difficult to prove. The modern fitness centre, once in place, will cut the middleman and make everything transparent,” said Vijay Kumar, Meerut regional transport officer.

Kumar added, “A three-acre plot in Partapur has been identified and a detailed report in this regard has been sent to the district magistrate. Once we get a green signal from him, we will go ahead with the plan.”

Till date only Lucknow, Agra and Kanpur in Uttar Pradesh have modern fitness centres in place.

A fitness test is necessary to ascertain if a vehicle is roadworthy and its emissions do not pollute the environment. Earlier, only commercial vehicles were checked for fitness but under the new Motor Vehicle Act , private vehicles too need to be checked.

Gandhi market

TRICHY: The decision not to shift the congested Gandhi market to Kallikudi integrated market has jeopardised the proposal of the corporation to redevelop the Gandhi market under the smart cities mission . As the traders will continue to operate from the Gandhi market complex owned by the corporation, the redevelopment of the market is unlikely to happen.

Ever since Trichy was selected under the smart cities mission in June 2017, redevelopment of Gandhi market has been finding a place in the list of proposals to be taken up under the mission. The civic body had suggested to demolish the existing market to build a spacious market with better amenities. For the purpose, it became inevitable to shift the traders of Gandhi market to Kallikudi integrated market. The civic body had even conducted a preliminary study and hired a consultant for redeveloping the market. But now as the Gandhi market shifting plan is shelved, the corporation is in a fix to implement the proposal.

The traders suggested a phased demolition and reconstruction of the market to avoid temporary lockdown, but the corporation said it is impossible. ""We have not taken a decision on Gandhi market redevelopment under the smart cities mission. Redeveloping the market without relocation is not feasible,"" an official said. Since the smart city proposals have to be implemented before 2022, any delay will hit the prospects of finishing the project in time. ""For the city to develop and remain free from traffic snarls, relocation of the market is necessary. Unfortunately, the authorities are not realising it,"" M Muthuganesan, a resident of Andar Street, said.

MEERUT: Thieves broke into an ATM at the main gate of Triveni sugar mill in Bulandshahr ’s Pahasu area on Saturday night and decamped with cash which is still unaccounted for. According to police , after making forced entry into the ATM kiosk, assailants may have used gas cutter to get inside the machine.

“Huge amount of burnt currency notes were recovered from the machine which was most likely burnt during attempt to break in using the gas cutter. Bank officials are trying to ascertain the total loss,” Santosh Kumar, Bulandshahr SSP said.

There was no security guard present at the kiosk, neither did the internal alarms which go off over unauthorised tactics to get inside the cash dispensing machine alert the central server of the bank, investigating sleuths said.

This is second such heist in over a fortnight in the district raising security concerns of ATM kiosks, especially in rural areas. Earlier, on January 31, the entire machine was stolen by thieves who got away with cash to the tune of Rs 5 lakh in a similar ATM heist in Bulandshahr’s Jahangirpur area.

Police had later recovered the cash dispensing machine dumped along the road near Sarai Chabila village, almost 10 km from the site of the ATM from where it was stolen.

In last night’s ATM heist, police claimed to have recovered the CCTV footage and are trying to ascertain the identity of the assailants. “In the CCTV footage, a van stopped near the ATM kiosk and two suspects got out. We are trying to develop it further. Investigation is going on,” the SSP Bulandshahr added.

Rotary Club of Nagpur organized the event at Mankapur Indoor Stadium

NAGPUR: ‘Give and take’ is the essence of Valentine ’s Day. Specially-abled children of different schools got a taste of true love at a programme organized by Rotary Club of Nagpur (RCN), in association with Lata Mangeshkar Hospital, at Mankapur Indoor Stadium on Friday.

It was time for nearly 800 children of 40 schools from the city and nearby villages to soak in unconditional love showered on them by the organizers and enjoy every moment of the daylong event ‘Udaan’. The programme gave them confidence to rise to the occasion, treat obstacles as a challenge and overcome them by dint of hard work, fun and frolic, and lead a meaningful life.

Chief guest Suresh Sharma, CMD of Baidyanath Ayurved Bhavan, was welcomed with a band performance by the students of Modern School. The flag hoisting was followed by a march-past by specially-abled children, led by Jeevoday School, with the rest following.

Students were in their element as they presented Bharatanatyam, patriotic and other forms of dances, and skits. It was a touching moment when deaf and mute children sang the national anthem in sign language, understood well by the viewers. They demonstrated that patriotism knows no barriers as it comes from the heart.

This was followed by a lively band performance by the students of Modern School.

These children proved their worth in competitions like relay, skipping, blind cricket, fancy dress, throwball, kabaddi, tug-of-war and other events. Last in the list but liked the most was Zumba dance performance. It was difficult for those present to hold back the tears of joy.

Earlier, in his address, Sharma said, “Every child has a desire to fulfil for which they require motivation. ‘Udaan’ gave specially-abled children the much-needed boost, and the environment was like a mini-Olympics in which students participated with the spirit of a true sportsperson.”

RCN president Parag Paranjpe said like every year, the 10th edition of ‘Udaan’ was a much-awaited event. “Fun activities and performances will keep their morale high, and this is the spirit they will carry with them for long.”

Rotary member Sanjay Sethi administered the oath. Secretary of RCN Namita Sharma proposed a vote of thanks.

But, over the years, we have all made a monster out of examinations. Be it the parents, students or teachers, we all have hyped up exams, as if one particular question or mark can make or break our life. We all have been through the cycle and know this is not at all true.As students gear up to prep for the scary Boards, Dr Samir Parikh, renowned psychologist and mental health expert shares some tips for students and parents this exam season.Dr Parikh feels that students, during this time are bombarded with a lot of information, advice but frankly, can do without a lot of these opinions. Asking teenagers to laugh and learn along the way, he also shared some real exercises to emerge a winner during this exam season:-The best way to learn is when you have fun. So this way, you are bound to get success.-Take exams as a learning opportunity which can help you perform better the next day.-Remember, you have been taking exams before and you would continue taking later.-10th, 12th exams are not everything. You will have college, office, interviews, appraisals and what not.-Everything we do is a test so do not make your boards the biggest exam.How to be efficient while studying?-Declutter the place you study. The table and chair should be organized.-One book or notebook you are studying from should be enough.-Do away with any phone/laptop or TV, distraction while studying.-Always use a table and chair.-The bed is for sleep, table is for studying.Dr Parikh also suggests students to start doing attention improving exercise. It can be simply done with the help of a paper and pen. For example, pick up a paper and circle out all those 'e's . It will help you focus better. Another activity you can try out is to concentrate on a different activity. Try to listen to instrumental music 10 minutes a day and focus on a single rhythm. Playing racquet sports is another way of boosting concentration.Stop and take breaksExams are the time you need to crunch and jot down details. However, studying for long hours is not going to help. Instead, try and study at a stretch- 40-45 minutes. Once you do so, take a break and do it again. In these short breaks, make sure you come out of the room. Do anything which makes you happy. Note making helps, it should be your own, mnemonics help. Remember, no distractions. Talk to a friend, family, hydrate yourself but no screen.What is a good revision plan?Just as important as studying is revising properly. A good hack, according to Dr. Parikh is remembering these numbers:1..2..5..7..15...30Whatever you study today, revise it tomorrow, and so forth. Doing this, your memory banks will store information well, you will revise better. Self-tests help you stay on track. You can also use a reward chart and track your progress accordingly.Apart from this, it is also important you have a healthy lifestyle in place. Remember to eat well, hydrate well and sleep on time. Undersleeping is the worst thing you could do to your body.What to do after the exams?An important thing to remember is once the exams are over, you need to give your mind a break. Attempt the paper confidently. Remember, exams are not a race and you don't need to finish before others. Do not compare- the number of sheets or the time. Once the exam is over, no postmortem.Remember, no matter what age, you will keep getting tested. What matters is, taking on the path of success.",life-style,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74134173,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-389754/74134173.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//life-style/parenting/teen/video-story-dr-samir-parikhs-tips-for-kids-and-parents-this-exam-season/articleshow/74134173.cms

402,['17/02/2020'],Bank should pump in more money into NBFCs: Kanoria,"This story is from February 17, 2020

The current financial year hasn’t gone well for the non-banking finance companies (NBFC) across the country owning to slowdown in business, sagging consumer demand and credit crunch. In an interview with TOI, the chairman of Srei Infrastructure Finance, India’s one of leading NBFCs, Hemant Kanoria , spoke on a range of issues from measures needed for jump-start the sector to future plans for his own group. Excerpts.

Q. In your opinion, what is the single-biggest factor behind the slow economic growth?

A: The lack of credit is hurting the economy most. Banks, for instance, currently have liquidity close to Rs 4 lakh crore, which they are not lending because of apprehensions. We need to bring back the confidence and encourage banks to release this money into the system. NBFCs, on the other hand, do not have sufficient liquidity for lending. These factors have resulted in a situation where credit flow has become constricted. This issue needs to be addressed to revive the economic growth of the country.

Q. What needs to be done to revive the flow of credit to sectors like infrastructure?

A: Infrastructure financing and investments entail a long-term perspective with an absolute clarity on viability, liquidity, dispute redressal and appropriate exit timing. The confidence of the investors and financial institutions/banks get reinforced if all the above are functioning in sync with each other. However, at this juncture, there are some gaps. The government is aware of the issues and is trying their best to find solutions. As soon as the issues are addressed, financial investors will be back with gusto.

We need to encourage banks to restart lending. Bankers are apprehensive in lending due to stringent guidelines and fear of an account going bad. If the customer is errant then the lender must initiate appropriate legal actions; but such instances are rare and probably account for only 1-2%. Hence, we need to change our mindset; majority in the system do not commit fraud and we have to build up a relationship of trust. As a lender when we support borrowers during a down cycle, then our money is safe, as the borrower is able to come out of the adverse situation. The regulator should consider reviewing the existing NPL norms in view of the present economic situation.

Q. Do you expect the government to step in and announce more steps to revive the economy?

A: While the Budget captures the government medium to long term vision, we hope that measures to address the liquidity issue will be announced soon. The government must also fast track the approval process in order to increase economic activities. We have suggested a model of deemed approval which should be introduced in every sphere. The tortuous, laborious and lengthy process of getting approvals creates fatigue, frustration and unviable cost escalation for every project or investment. I am confident that if few of these simple tweaks are implemented, then India can quickly go back to GDP growth of 9-10%.

Q. Are foreign investors still exploring investment opportunities in India?

A: At this juncture, there are primarily the stressed asset and vulture capital funds that are currently eyeing investment opportunities in India. The reason being the valuations are extremely low as most of the Indian companies and assets are in distressed or stressed situation. So, these funds are looking at opportunities where they can acquire companies/assets for 10-20 cents to a dollar. In a way it implies that we are selling assets/companies cheap.

Q. Coming back to Srei, which will be your focus area for growth?

A: For last few years, our focus has been to grow our equipment finance portfolio. We are seeing a silent recovery in demand for equipment, which had fallen by 25-30% in the last couple of years, especially since the episode. The government is seized of the slowdown in infrastructure investments and the economy. So, we are sanguine that the demand will pick up soon with awarding of new EPC contracts.

Q. So, you have decided to exit your infrastructure project financing business?

A: Srei board, in the year 2014-15, had taken a decision that they will reduce the infrastructure project financing portfolio gradually over the years due to increased risks in the sector. We are the veterans in infrastructure financing sector and it will be sad if at an appropriate time we do not make a comeback.

Q. Will you enter into any new businesses, like retail finance?

A: Unless and until there is clarity on the liquidity front it is not wise to venture into new businesses. At Srei, we have comfortable liquidity from the perspective of repayment of our liabilities. Hence, we will wait and watch the situation before starting a new business.

GVMC is in the process of installing QR code-embedded radio tags on the walls of every household

VISAKHAPATNAM: The Greater Visakhapatnam Municipal Corporation ( GVMC ) has started leveraging technology in its waste management system. The civic body is in the process of installing QR code-embedded radio frequency identification (RFID) tags on the walls of every household.

Sanitation workers will scan the QR codes on devices provided by the GVMC on a daily basis which will make an entry into the online database of the civic body. The data thus collected will be used by GVMC to track the extent of work done on a daily basis. Officials expect that this will stop sanitation workers skip houses.

These tags have already been affixed in nearly three lakh houses in the city. The remaining houses are also expected to be covered in the next few days.

Speaking to TOI, Dr KSLG Sastry, the chief medical officer of GVMC said that the QR code-based household waste management system is being implemented on a pilot basis at present. “This (the system) will be replicated in all parts of the city in the next few days,” he said.

Dr Sastry further said that this will enable the GVMC to monitor door-to-door garbage collection. “The QR code tags are also being affixed to dustbins to monitor waste collection and disposal . We have taken these initiatives at the directions of GVMC commissioner G Srijana,” the chief medical officer added.

According to Dr Sastry, the civic body is focussed on implementing segregation at source at the moment. “We have been creating awareness among the public on the importance of sorting and segregating waste before it enters the municipal solid waste system. The full potential of this can be tapped only through appropriate segregation at source,” he added.

The chief medical officer said that the civic body plans to reach out to nearly four lakh people in the city and that it is making use of the Swachhata App to address complaints from the public.

Meanwhile, the GVMC has also introduced a facial recognition-based attendance system for workers to check inconsistency.

Visakhapatnam: Dronamraju Srinivas Rao, chairman of Visakhapatnam Metropolitan Region Development Authority ( VMRDA ) has written to education minister A Suresh seeking monthly consolidated pay to guest faculty of Andhra University instead of offering semester-wise or paper-wise honorarium.

Rao wrote the letter upon receiving a representation from the AU guest faculty association.

In their representation, the association members said that nearly 150 guest faculty have been teaching at the varsity for over a decade with paltry wages.

Recently, the state government issued an order prescribing Rs 37,000 monthly consolidated pay for contractual junior lecturers and Rs 44,000 consolidated pay for contractual degree college lecturers, said the association.

The association cited the UGC circular which stated that universities can offer a maximum monthly pay of Rs 50,000 per month to guest faculty and that the Haryana government has adopted the policy already.

In their representation, the guest faculty also informed the VMRDA chairman that some universities in AP were also consolidated pay to guest faculty. They said that AU guest faculty get only Rs 150 per day and have been facing severe financial hardship.

Visakhapatnam: A mobile application designed to collect data and map secretariats will have to use its offline version to collect data and map secretariats in Visakhapatnam Agency . Located on the margins, these areas lack connectivity, causing the online application to not work.

The Visakhapatnam Agency is by far the largest chunk of the agency tract in north-coastal Andhra Pradesh. The remaining area is distributed between East Godavari, Vizianagaram and Srikakulam.

As per the data provided by Visakhapatnam district authorities, there are 212 secretariats with every single secretariat comprising 50 households. The government has designed a model application to upload data for every secretariat.

District collector of Visakhapatnam, V Vinay Chand said, “Keeping the peculiar problem in mind, the government has also designed an offline app which will help store data which can be subsequently transferred online.”

The collector added that the offline app is a must in Visakhapatnam Agency. “This app has been tried and tested and will be released any time now so that we can go ahead with mapping secretariats in the entire district,” Chand said.

There are a few such areas in Vizianagaram district and the Rampachodavaram area in East Godavari as well. Vizianagaram district collector M Hari Jawaharlal said, “The online mapping method cannot be introduced in interior parts bordering Odisha.”

Sources say that around 300 secretariats will have to use the offline app for mapping secretariats in north-coastal Andhra Pradesh.

Visakhapatnam: Members of CPI(M)’s Visakhapatnam district unit said on Sunday that the state government is indulging in business through its land pooling exercise in the district. In a press release, CPI(M) district secretary K Lokanatham alleged that revenue officials and YSRC legislators are pooling land forcibly.

“Revenue officials have received consent to pool only 3,000 acres from farmers. That shows that there is stiff resistance from farmers. District officials recently announced that the pooled land will be divided into 59 blocks and people will be allocated one cent layouts, with 15% going to VMRDA and some part going to farmers,” read the release issued on behalf of Lokanatham.

It further said that poor peasants have been appealing to the state government for pattas for land under their possession for the last 20 years but the government has never given in to the demand in the name of urban agglomeration.

“Even after cultivating these places for the last two to three decades, these poor peasants are now being called encroachers. GO number 294 clearly stated that arable land should not be part of land pooling. But the government has skirted its own order and issued GO number 72 for land pooling. We demand that the government immediately revoke the order issued for land pooling,” Lokanatham said, according to the release.

408,['17/02/2020'],"No middlemen, APCOS to take charge of outsourcing","This story is from February 17, 2020

Visakhapatnam: The state government has decided to stop outsourcing staff from private agencies. Instead, the government has conferred the responsibility of appointing contractual staff to the Andhra Pradesh Corporation for Outsourced Services ( APCOS ).

According to a government order issued on November 20, 2019, APCOS will work towards removing private outsourcing agencies and middlemen while appointing staff.

There are around 45,000 outsourced employees working with state government. The GO further noted that no outsourced employees will be removed and that their enrolment will come under APCOS.

“We have already started this initiative. This comes with advantages for both the government and outsourced staff,” said a senior official.

The reason behind this decision is that an agency from where the government outsources staff takes a commission of 20 per cent from the government. This percentage is calculated on the total number of staff outsourced by a particular agency.

Officials say that if the government removes these private agencies in the middle it can save the additional 20 per cent. “Not only that, we can actually pass on a portion of the savings to outsourced employees,” the official added.

There have been several complaints of partiality against these outsourced agencies while selecting staff. Moreover, there have even been complaints that agencies have not paid salaries even after receiving payment from the government. Some of the agencies have not even provided employee provident fund and ESI facilities to staff.

“In the present arrangement, APCOS will appoint staff and pay salaries to them directly. We will ensure the proper crediting of EPF and ESI,” the official mentioned.

Visakhapatnam: Residents of Visakhapatnam are increasingly taking to organic food. Moreover, the practice of cooking in earthen pots in the traditional way is also gaining popularity. Cashing in on this demand for organic food, a number of organic food hotels have come up in the city.

J Kumara Swamy, one of the founders of Cow-Based Natural Farmers’ Welfare Association said that the city currently has two hotels that prepare food with exclusively organic products.

KV Suresh Kumar, proprietor of Amulyam— an organic food restaurant near Sampath Vinayak Temple said that a meal made of organic food costs Rs 200 on average, around double the price of a general meal.

“Most of the items are cooked in non-glazed clay pots. We make the oil we use in wooden oil mills. Moreover, we use organic vegetables that we cultivate in our own farms at Garividi in Vizianagaram,” added Kumar.

Environmentalist JV Ratnam informed that in the recently held organic mela, organic farming welfare associations chalked out plans to develop organic farming and organic hotels in the state across Visakhapatnam, Vijayawada, Tirupati and Kakinada.

VISAKHAPATNAM: The first cargo flight that was due to start operations from Visakhapatnam on February 15 could not take off on account of Navy restrictions on time slots, according to members of the Andhra Pradesh Air Travellers Association (APATA).

SpiceJet had agreed to start an exclusive cargo flight Chennai-Vizag-Kolkata following efforts by the APATA. The cargo flight was slated to carry 20 tonnes on a daily basis from mid-February 2020.

Visakhapatnam MP MVV Satyanarayana has submitted a representation to Union minister of defence Rajnath Singh on the restrictions on movement of civilian aircraft at Visakhapatnam Airport and has requested that restrictions be relaxed.

The letter stated that due to restrictions and non-availability of suitable time slots in Visakhapatnam airport, operators will opt to divert flights to other airports.

If restrictions by the Navy are imposed, the growth of the city will suffer a major setback, the letter said, adding that decline in passenger traffic will have an adverse impact on other sectors, particularly tourism, merchandise exports, sea food and pharma exports, IT sector and the hotel industry.

Further, as the city is likely to be the state executive capital, air traffic is expected to increase by over 50 per cent in the immediate short term, inclduing cargo flights, the letter said.

The letter also said that due to military slots, no additional slots are available for civilian flights between 9 am to 12 pm and 6 pm to 9 pm, which has affected the introduction of new civilian flights to and from the city.

A trek followed by an interaction with experts about conservation of these species was held as part of the observance on Sunday.

The Fishing Cat (Prionailurus viverrinus) is a small wild cat found across eight countries in Asia. “Because of their dependency on water, fishing cats are threatened by the loss of wetlands, swamps and mangrove habitats. Urbanisation, farming and other human-animal conflict also mean that populations are set to drop by up to 30%. The fishing cat is listed as ‘vulnerable’ in the IUCN Red List and is also protected legally under the Indian Wildlife Protection Act 1972,” informed conservation biologist Murthy Kantimahanti.

419,['17/02/2020'],Mamata may call on governor Dhankhar at Raj Bhavan today,"This story is from February 17, 2020

Kolkata: Chief minister Mamata Banerjee is likely to go to Raj Bhavan on Monday to pacify governor Jagdeep Dhankhar, who has been iterating his reservations about law and order problems in the state.

Though Dhankhar had followed protocol and read out the speech preapred by the state government during the budget session opening on February 7, he had initially wanted to make alterations in the speech approved by the state cabinet. He had communicated this to the state government. But Nabanna officials did not agree. Days after reading out the unaltered speech in the assembly, Dhankhar continued criticising the state government.

The governor and state government’s relationship has been at odds ever since Dhankhar went to Jadavpur University to rescue Union minister Babul Supriyo, who was gheraoed on the varsity campus in September. Even the governor faced a similar situation, following which Dhankhar opted for CISF to guard him.

In December, the governor, who is also Chancellor of JU, was not allowed to attend its convocation. Dhankhar had invited all vice-chancellors to a meeting in Raj Bhavan in mid-January to discuss their problems, but all 20 VCs skipped the meet and later formed an Upacharjya Parishad. The state made a new rule through which all communications from Raj Bhavan to VCs were to be routed through the higher education department’s prinicpal secretary.

On January 28, Dhankhar tried to attend Calcutta University’s convocation, but was not allowed to enter due to some agitating students, for which the governor had criticised Kolkata Police. Nobel laureate Abhijit Banerjee was present at the event to receive an honorary DLitt. Dhankhar had said he was greatly pained by the incident.

Last week, the governor, also chancellor of all state universities, had been vocal about being kept in the dark about the convocation of Cooch Behar Panchanan Barma University, held on February 14.

It might be recalled that on January 26, CM Banerjee had attended a tea party hosted by the governor in Raj Bhavan. They held discussions for a couple of minutes. That day, as a special podium was set up for the governor in the Raj Bhavan garden for the Republic Day function, the CM had felt isolated, sources hinted.

Earlier, Dhankhar had repeatedly urged the CM to work together for the development of Bengal and poposed meetings either in Raj Bhavan or at Nabanna, but Banerjee has so far been silent.

Sources hinted the CM might visit Raj Bhavan around noon before going to the assembly or after attending the assembly session. Officials, however, are tightlipped on the agenda the two are likely to discuss. The governor has already used veto on some bills.

State parliamentary affairs minister and Trinamool secretary general Partha Chatterjee said Dhankhar had called up Banerjee expressing his intention to meet her.

Chatterjee, who had earlier tried to play the bridge between Nabanna and Raj Bhavan, was instrumental in convincing the governor to read out the budget session speech approved by the state. He had met Dhankhar twice before the session opened, and said at the time that the governor was keen to have a meeting with the CM at least once a month. “I do not know if the CM is going to attend the meeting tomorrow, as she will be in the assembly. Again, if they meet, what they will discuss is privy to them,” Chatterjee said.

Murshidabad/Malda: A girder for an under-construction bridge that was being carried with the help of a crane slipped and killed at least three persons at Baishnabnagar in Malda on Sunday evening. Three are in critical condition. Several labourers are feared trapped below the girder.

One of the victims has been identified by police as Sachin Pratap, and another, sources said, is engineer Srinivas Rao.

The girder was being set up for the construction of a 1.5km-long bridge on the Ganga at Farakka, being built parallel to NH34 between Farakka and Baishnabnagar in Malda to decongest the national highway. The work on the bridge began in January 2019.

Farakka’s Congress MLA Moinul Haq claimed at least four persons were killed in the accident and two were critically injured. He said it was an accident as the girder had slipped. The accident happened aropund 8pm.

Sources said NHAI had given contract to an agency for the bridge construction. Senior NHAI project officials have rushed to the spot and are trying to find out the cause of the accident; they will initiate a probe.

NHAI officials are also trying to ascertain if proper safety measures were followed. They said work on the bridge was continuing round the clock and there were over a dozen people at the spot when the accident happened.

Police and a disaster management team were pressed into service and four injured labourers were ferried to Malda Medical College and Hospital.

Transport minister Suvendu Adhikari said the state government was trying to provide the best medical aid to those injured.

Malda SP Aloke Rajoria said one of those killed had been identified as Sachin Pratap. Nine labourers, he added, were injured and four were admitted to Malda Medical College and Hospital.

An injured labourer from Bihar, Santosh Kumar, said: “A girder being placed between pillars 1 and 2 suddenly slipped from the crane and fell on us. Many workers were there and it fell on their heads. My leg was badly injured.”

Sunil Sarkar, who heads a contractor association, alleged the accident happened due to the use of poor quality material and demanded a thorough probe. He also sought compensation for the casualties.

Prof Partha Pratim Biswas of JU’s construction engineering department said the accident could have happened due to faulty erection and lack of proper safety measures.

421,['17/02/2020'],"After ‘Didi ke Bolo’, BJP comes up with its own ‘bolo’ campaign","This story is from February 17, 2020

Kolkata: After ‘Dada ke Bolo’, Bengal BJP plans to launch ‘BJP ke Bolo’ in an attempt to foil Trinamool’s ‘Didi ke Bolo’ campaign.

Months before municipal elections, Bengal BJP has launched the mass outreach initiative styled on ‘Didi ke Bolo’, which received a huge response in each of its three phases. While BJP’s initiative will initially be restricted to its members, the scheme will soon be thrown open to the masses seeking their complaints and suggestions.

Aimed at touching maximum number of citizens, ‘BJP ke Bolo’ will be rolled out within a fortnight to reach party members under each of the 127 municipal bodies. “We have a membership of nearly a crore in the state. Initially, it will be restricted to party members. Based on feedback from the pilot project, it will be rolled out among the masses,” a Bengal BJP leader said.

The proposal, touted merely a month back, was placed at the party’s two-day organisational meeting at ICCR. It was suggested that WhatsApp groups be created for each of the 127 municipalities where party members would initially submit grievances about civic amenities and suggestions. Th-ey would also provide proposals for gearing up the organisation at the block level.

“This will be an extension of ‘bistarak yojana’ continuing at the district level. Party workers are closer to what is happening on the ground and can provide crucial inputs,” said Sayantan Basu, state general secretary. “We are at a primary stage now. We hope to roll out the initiative in a fortnight.”

‘Didi Ke Bolo’, launched last July, received over 10 la-kh phone calls in the first month. Party leaders conducted mass contact rallies in 1,022 villages within a mo-nth. The response from districts prompted TMC to launch the third phase last October. Over 600 block and town presidents were asked to visit more than 2,000 villages and municipal wards.

The success of ‘Didi ke Bolo’ had earlier prompted Bengal BJP to launch ‘Dada Ke Bolo’, where state president Dilip Ghosh met people over tea and listened to their grievances. “We had a somewhat similar feedback system during the 2019 polls. People gave suggestions on central government said Raju Banerjee, general secretary of Bengal BJP.

The state BJP unit has been working on the draft “vision document” for the municipal polls. “Inputs from ‘BJP ke Bolo’ programme will be used to give that a final shape. District in-charges will collate suggestions and send them to the state leaders,” Bannerjee said.

KOLKATA: There have been fewer days of below-13-degree Celsius minimum temperature in Kolkata this winter than in 2018-2019, but such days were spread out much more evenly than in last winter, leading many to believe this winter was colder.The number of days a place registers minimum temperatures below 13°C is an important index of measuring a winter’s “bite”. Kolkata winters conventionally start in mid-December and end in mid-February, giving the city a two-month winter season.A study by TOI of the minimum temperatures between December 15, 2019, and February 15, 2020, has thrown up 20 days when the mercury dipped below the 13-degree mark. There were 23 such days last season.The coldest day last season, too, recorded a temperature lower than this season’s coldest. “The lowest temperature recorded last winter was 10.6°C, while this time the mercury didn’t plunge lower than 11.1°C,” said G K Das, director, Regional Meteorological Centre. “But the fact that the chilly days were more evenly spread out made the chill feeling persistent. Compared with this season, last winter, we had a cluster of chilly days interspersed with periods of moderate temperature,” Das explained.Das said that January 2019 saw a 10-day spell when the temperature kept plunging below 13°C.“There was another short spell prior to that, in December. But this winter had shorter, frequent spells that kept recurring till late January. This was due to the frequent western disturbances that originate in the north-western Himalayas and float across the northern plains. These systems kept triggering rain in south Bengal, sucking up all the moisture. This later paved the way for the cold northwesterly wind to flow in unobstructed and pull the mercury down,” he said.Around five western disturbances affected Bengal this winter. The last one struck as late as January 28-29, leading to drizzles in Kolkata. This year, Kolkata had the wettest January since 2013, with the rain count touching 42.5mm for the month, far higher than normal. Only once in the last 10 years did the city receive more rain during the first month of the year, considered to be the peak winter period, when precipitation is negligible.Frequent western disturbances — not unusual at this time of the year, but fewer in number — were responsible for the sudden spurt in rainfall, according to weathermen at the Met office.",kolkata,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74167019,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-561024,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/last-winter-in-kolkata-was-colder-says-met-but-you-felt-a-sharper-bite-this-time/articleshow/74166414.cms

NEW DELHI: Arvind Kejriwal was sworn in for a third consecutive term as chief minister of Delhi, along with his cabinet, by lieutenant governor Anil Baijal on Sunday afternoon at Ramlila Maidan as a capacity crowd cheered. Addressing the people later, he attributed his overwhelming victory to the common man of Delhi, making the Aam Aadmi Party ’s “new kind of politics” the centrepiece of the celebrations.“The people of Delhi have given birth to new politics in the country. This is the politics of work — schools, hospital, 24-hour and cheap power supply, water, good roads, women’s security, a corruptionfree city — politics of 21st century India,” he said, in remarks that were the closest he came to making a national pitch. He said this had started resonating across the country and other states were either emulating it or being denied any reason not to do so with people asking, “If Delhi can do it, why can’t you?”In an apparent gesture to people migrating to the city, he told those already here to call up their villages and say, “Hamara beta CM ban gaya dobara, chinta ki koi baat nahi hai” (Our son has become the CM again, there’s no need to worry). This was a direct call to AAP’s support base in slums and unauthorised colonies.He defended AAP’s freebies — free power, water, bus rides for women etc — with the remark: “Everything precious in the world created by God is free...Kejriwal loves people of Delhi and they love Kejriwal. This love is also priceless.” He added: “Do I start charging people for education and health? Do I start charging patients for their operations? That is not possible.”Kejriwal began his address with a full-throated cry of “Bharat mata ki jai, Inquilab zindabad and Vande mataram”. He was conciliatory in his demeanour, saying they had a lot of work to do in order to bring prosperity and happiness to people in the next five years and he would not discriminate between supporters of different parties. “I am everyone’s CM,” he declared.Kejriwal said the elections were over and he had forgiven the opposition for the remarks made against him during campaigning.I want to work together with all parties for development of Delhi. I want to work with the central government to take Delhi forward and make it a world-class city,” he said. In this regard, he sought the blessings of the PM and central government.The high-octane political canvassing ahead of the assembly polls had seen at least two senior BJP leaders, including a Union minister, calling Kejriwal a “terrorist”, forcing AAP run a counter campaign dubbing him the “son” of Delhi.But, in an oblique reference to the debate over nationalism, he linked the honour of the Tricolour fluttering in the wind to education, health, women’s safety, jobs, happiness for farmers and, finally, people rising above caste and religion to take India forward.Kejriwal ended his address with the Hindi version of “We shall overcome” i.e “Hum honge kamyab”, urging the crowd to sing with him.

Deviating from the format of ministers taking the oath in the name of God, Rai and Gautam took the oath in the name of “martyrs of the freedom movement” and “Tathagata Buddha”, respectively.The swearing in ceremony — chief secretary Vijay Dev reading out the notification of the President of India appointing the chief minister and his council of ministers followed by the LG making them take the oath of office and secrecy — lasted barely 18 minutes.On either side of the dais were sitting ‘Dilli ke 50 Nirmata’ (50 creators of Delhi), selected by AAP from diverse backgrounds for their contribution to the “development” of the city. Drawn from diverse backgrounds — woman driver of metro, doctors at mohalla clinics, bus marshalls, farmers, anganwadi workers, autowallahs etc — some of them were profiled in TOI on Sunday. This underlined AAP’s theme that it was a people’s government.“Who are these creators (nirmatas)?” the CM posed to the crowd. “Delhi is not run by Kejriwal, politicians or parties. It is run by its teachers, doctors, autorickshaw drivers, rickshaw-pullers, students, bus drivers, conductors, vendors, businessmen and factory owners,” he explained, underlining the role of the aam aadmi.“I am happy that we have with us Vijay Kumar, who is studying at IIT. After passing out, he will serve the country. The future of the country depends on such youth,” said Kejriwal. “We have Dalbir Singh from Najafgarh. He is a retired teacher and earlier built the future of children. He is a farmer now and grows grains for you. We have Nidhi Gupta with us. You travel in the Metro to office and back, and she runs the Metro. She is a Metro pilot.”Arvind Kejriwal’s parents, wife Sunita, daughter Harshita and son Pulkit were present at the ceremony.

Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay

MUMBAI: The protests against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) divided the Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay, campus as it polled for annual elections on Sunday. Graduate and undergraduate students picked their general secretary for academic affairs, cultural, sports and hostel affairs amid controversies and complaints.

Ahead of the voting, a social media post that urged students not to vote for a candidate because he was found sloganeering at an anti-CAA protest created a stir. The post, which read: ""He is a candidate, think twice before voting"" was accompanied by a video from the December 19 protest at August Kranti Maidan which the candidate had participated in. The social media campaigns also named another candidate.

The candidate in the video refused to comment, but a close friend said, ""The malicious content and intent has distressed the candidate and he suffered an anxiety attack and may seek help from counsellors. He believes in the Constitution and has been passionate about social work. Looking at such a hate campaign against him, his family is also under stress."" Candidates contesting against him refused to comment.

Some students also urged others to opt for NOTA. Condemning the influence of external groups on the institute's elections, a Facebook post said, ""We absolutely denigrate the targeting of our fellow students. No matter what the debate within our campus is, the calling out of a student within our campus as a seditious individual by organizations outside our campus is horrifying.""

While authorities from IIT Bombay refused to comment, members of the election commission said they would look into the complaints.
