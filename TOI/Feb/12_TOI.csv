The duo seemed to have found a comfort zone with each other, which often had co-contestants envious, and their dance performances on the show created a lot of buzz too. Bangalore Times got the two of them to meet for the first time since the show wrapped up. Excerpts from their chat...I’ve finished my round of mandatory interviews, but Deepika still has to do hers. We have been making plans to meet for lunch or dinner, but things have just not worked out yet.We have a lot of plans that we had made inside the house, which we have to follow up on. These include long drives, meals and lots of conversations about the house.Yes, there were a lot of things that we couldn’t share inside the house. We have to catch up to discuss that!Yes, Deepika was my censor, while I was the loudspeaker. Every time I crossed the line, she would shout, ‘Foul’.Kishen is someone who just speaks whatever comes to his mind. So, there were times when I would even hold his hand and request him to be quiet. It was very difficult to handle him (laughs). But, thankfully he did listen to me.I am very passionate about my clothes and styling.Same pinch.So, the two of us used discuss style and related topics.Fridays used to be free days for us. So, I’d wear many options and ask her opinion. She used to do the same in the evening and ask for my opinion.We found that with each passing week we could trust each other's opinion when it came to styling.Good question.We are good friends and we will be together always.We became good friends because of the kitchen in the Bigg Boss house. She used to cook, while I used to cut vegetables for her. We have a good equation as friends. We do not want to spoil the equation by taking it to the next level.No way. I’m done with my share of cooking in the house. But, I will definitely continue to cook for my loved ones on special occasions.So, what’s next?I have my future planned and the blue print is ready.

So, it’s not surprising that a city-based Japanese linguist and analyst, who is also a Bharatanatyam dancer, has picked up Japanese dance forms like Awa Odori (Tokushima traditional dance) and Nihon Buyo (17th century Japanese folk dance). Ranita Saha , who also goes by the name Ranita-san, performed for the third time at this year’s Japan Habba. She talks to us about her love for Japanese dance forms, cuisine and more...Ranita tells us that it all started from her college days when she read manga (Japanese comics) and watched anime. “As a college student, I was interested in Japanese culture soon after I took up the language as one of my electives. The classes got me to research more on their traditional forms of dance, cuisine and history. Gradually, the love for the culture grew, and I moved to Nara, Japan for a year to pursue a diploma in Japanese and tried to imbibe as much as I could from their culture — from cooking Japanese food to interacting with the locals. Now, I can speak Japanese fluently and have picked up many of their cultural habits and recipes.”Ranita, who is also a trained Bharatanatyam dancer, learnt dance forms like Awa Odori and Nihon Buyo, through online videos. “I had watched videos of Geishas, Meikos and other Japanese dancers, and observed how they would use beautiful props like fans and umbrellas. Watching them move gracefully, in sync with the rhythm of songs, inspired me to take up these dance forms.” On performing Hyakunen Yakou this year, which is also known as the dance of the fox, Ranita says, “This is a Japanese dance based on how an individual turns into a fox. In Japan, foxes are considered magical creatures that can shape-shift. They are also considered deities. My performance includes traditional Japanese dance steps, as well as modern moves with props like the Japanese fan and umbrella. I danced to the song Hyakunen Yakou.”Talking about her third performance at the festival, Ranita says, “My aim is to introduce as many people as I can to Japanese culture and help them develop the kind of love that I have for the country, its people and culture.

3,['12/02/2020'],I am writing a book on an outsider’s struggle in Bollywood: Richa Chadha,"‘I used to love reading fiction earlier, but now I prefer political non-fiction more’

‘What it means to be an outsider in Bollywood...’

‘Star kids should acknowledge the privilege they have’

‘A life outside films...’

‘Ali Fazal and I mostly meet at the airport’

‘I share a close bond with Bengaluru’

Well-known for her bold characters in films, Richa Chadha is quite the book-lover too. She was recently in town, speaking as part of the Times Lit Fest. In a tête-à-tête with us, Richa expresses her views on nepotism, why she meets Ali Fazal at the airport, her love for Mysore Pak and more. Excerpts:During my teenage years, Salman Rushdie ’s books were my favourite, among others. In fact, I used to hide in the bathroom and read, as my mother wanted me to focus on textbooks instead. Later when I moved to Mumbai, books kind of took a back seat. But I am trying to get back into the habit again, and prefer reading political non-fiction now. In fact, currently, I am writing a book. It’s a series of anecdotal essays that are loosely based on my life. It touches upon aspects such as what it means to be an outsider in Bollywood, mainly focusing on the difficulties and restrictions that an aspiring artiste faces there.It means that you should consider yourself lucky if you manage to get a good role in your first break in Bollywood. But the struggle doesn’t end there. It continues even after you have done one or two more good films, and even further.Nepotism exists in the Hindi film industry, and outsiders are among the worst affected by it. For instance, when I moved to Mumbai, I used to share a room with a college friend and split the bills and other household expenses. These are things that star kids would probably never experience. But by that, I don’t mean that they don’t have their share of stress and struggles. They have to face inter-generational competition and comparisons. Nevertheless, they should acknowledge the privilege they have.I have a fuller life outside of films too. I also devote a lot of time for social causes, like fighting for animal rights and protecting the environment. My friends also ensure that I stay sane and happy.I often travel to the city he is shooting in or he comes down to meet me wherever I am shooting.I used to visit this city often earlier, to meet a very dear friend of mine. We used to then go to Cubbon Park for a jog. I also enjoy eating Mysore Pak on each of my trips here.",bengaluru,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74084171,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-255042,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/i-am-writing-a-book-on-an-outsiders-struggle-in-bollywood-richa-chadha/articleshow/74084197.cms

More than 250 second and third year students participated in it, showcasing a plethora of projects that included audio-visual exhibits, unique prototypes and other installations, as curious audience members browsed through them patiently. Here’re a few glimpses…The relationship between human and nature is the focus of this project — a pictorial description. Elaborating on it, Poorvi Garag, an information arts and design student, says, “Located between Bengaluru and Mysuru, Kokkarebellur is a well-known shelter and breeding ground for migratory birds, particularly the spot-billed pelican and the painted stork. What’s more interesting is that over the years, the local community that lives there has built a special relationship with these mating birds, so much so that these species have become almost a part of their lives. Our photo book concentrates on this factor, as we strive to explain the bond between human beings and the ecosystem around us.”Industrial arts and design students took a leap into the future, as they put up innovative demonstrations. Vaishnavi Walunj and her classmates attempted to look at the world in 2120 through an intriguing project. “We are imagining a world, where commuters are ditching conventional vehicles for ‘bubble pods’. We have used nanotechnology to craft these pods. For the prototype, we have used a model of Pune, a place where greenery and technology coexist,” says Vaishnavi. On the contrary, Srishti and Avina put the spotlight on walking as an important mode of transport. “We are trying to figure if the energy generated through human footsteps can be used as fuel for public transport in the future. Walkways come in handy in this project,” explains Srishti.Meanwhile, students pursuing creative writing put up a performance highlighting gender issues. And they did that through spoken word.

9,['12/02/2020'],Redefining romance a decade after marriage,"From being lovers to spouses to parents, their relationship has undergone many beautiful changes over the years. But, what has not changed is their love for each other. With Valentine’s Day around the corner, BT spoke to some couples from showbiz, who have been together for more than a decade. They spoke to us about redefining romance, keeping the spark alive in their marriage and the importance of finding the right partner. Read on...Ronit and Neelam Roy, who have been married for 17 years, feel that love is celebrated in the moments spent with family. Ronit says, “Valentine’s Day is more like a marketing gimmick now — people splurge on gifts and flowers. But for me, every day spent with my wife and children is V-Day. Many years ago, Neelam and I went to Las Vegas for a romantic holiday, leaving our children behind. However, we missed them so much that we decided never to go on any dates, dinners or holidays without them. Over the years, I have learnt that the success of a marriage depends on the sacrifices and adjustments a couple make for each other. Mutual understanding is also important. Romance and love are all about family and spending quality time together. And, you don’t need Valentine’s Day to celebrate togetherness.”Ram and Gautami first met and fell in love on the sets of the TV show, 'Ghar Ek Mandir'. And then, on Valentine’s Day, 2003, they tied the knot. Ram says, “V-Day is special for us because we got married on that day. We have been together for almost 20 years now. Over the years and after having two children, our love has grown deeper. It is more about companionship and dependence now, as we move into our middle age. It is crucial to choose the right life partner. Marriage is a marathon and you can grow old together only if you gel well. In fact, if you don’t find the right person, it is better to be single.”Manav and Shweta, who met on the sets of 'Kahaani Ghar Ghar Kii', got married in 2004. Today, after more than 15 years of marriage, Manav says, “Pyaar ka rang gehra ho chuka hai (laughs!).” He adds, “Shweta’s birthday falls on February 10 and so, for us, it is party time from then to V-Day. What I appreciate the most is the fact that over the years, our house has transformed into a home. Of course, we are not so romantic now. In fact, for many years after my daughter Zahra was born, it was tough to kiss or even hug Shweta because Zahra was extremely possessive about me and would not let me hug anyone else. However, I like to make Valentine’s Day special by appreciating the fact that Shweta has put a lot of life into our mundane existence. We find a lot of joy in small things that life offers — be it enjoying music together or just having a nice conversation.”Gurdip and Arjun Punjj met on the sets of their show, Sanjivani, in 2002 and got married after four years of courtship. They have been married for 13 years now. Gurdip says that time has not dampened the romance in their marriage. “Both Arjun and I are die-hard romantics and it’s been the same since the time we started dating. We have two children now and our schedules revolve mostly around them, but that does not stop us from being mushy or planning a romantic holiday around V-Day. In fact, we still enjoy wearing our best outfits and look forward to spending some quality time together. I feel marriage should be a happy partnership and a good balance of emotions and responsibilities. There could be differences and ups and downs — sometimes, he is working more and I am working less or vice versa, but one person always takes the lead. That is the kind of understanding we have developed over the years.”Sai and Shakti, who got married in January 2005, have an eight-year-old daughter. For this couple, what makes V-Day even more exciting is the fact that their daughter is fascinated by the concept. Sai says, “On V-Day, my daughter is excited about Shakti and I wearing red outfits and having a candlelight dinner with our families. Earlier, Shakti would surprise me with gifts and I would cook a great meal for him. But now, my daughter wants her parents to celebrate the day the way she understands it. Maybe after she grows older, we will rediscover a new way to celebrate the occasion.”Yash and Gouri, who have been married for 17 years, are parents to two daughters. Gouri says, “V-Day is not as lovey-dovey as it used to be, and we no longer spend money on materialistic things, but it gives us a reason to do something different in our otherwise mechanical lives. It could just be about gifting Yash a bottle of wine. And, when he pours the wine into two glasses, and waits for me to join him after I finish my chores, makes everything feel worth it. Love has evolved over the years and I have learnt many things from Yash. For example, he has taught me how to let go of small things because they don’t matter in the long run. Now, Valentine’s Day is more of a celebration of how we have successfully overcome the odds and walked together.”",tv,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74082834,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-72557/74082834.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//tv/news/hindi/redefining-romance-a-decade-after-marriage/articleshow/74082779.cms

The actress has, in fact, just come back after a 35-day schedule in Varanasi for Jayathirtha Banaras. “Shooting there was quite the eye-opener. For someone who hasn’t been there before, you tend to have this image of a place that is holy and invokes spirituality. Varanasi does live up to that, but sadly, the Ganga, is quite polluted. In fact, some of the imagery was in such stark contrast; while we saw animal waste floating in the river, only metres away, people were doing Ganga puja,” says





And while the actress also has films with big banners and heroes, her heart lies in subjects that she can lead. “Being a part of A-list films, no doubt, looks good on your portfolio, gives you a wide audience and opens new opportunities. But these films tend to always revolve around the hero, with the female characters relegated to being the glam element. I don’t have a problem with that, but I don’t want to do ‘only’ that. I have my own dreams and want to be a part of films that I can lead. In fact, one of the films that I have agreed to be a part of explores the Air India crash in Mangaluru. It is a subject that is close to my heart as well. The team is new and young and their energy is infectious. They had an entire presentation ready about the heroine, her characterisation, mannerisms, etc.,” she says, adding, “I think the time is right for me to start experimenting and stretching myself as an artiste.

12,['12/02/2020'],I am writing a book on an outsider’s struggle in Bollywood: Richa Chadha,"Well-known for her bold characters in films, Richa Chadha is quite the book-lover too. She was recently in town, speaking as part of the Times Lit Fest. In a tête-à-tête with us, Richa expresses her views on nepotism, why she meets Ali Fazal at the airport, her love for Mysore Pak and more. Excerpts:During my teenage years, Salman Rushdie’s books were my favourite, among others. In fact, I used to hide in the bathroom and read, as my mother wanted me to focus on textbooks instead. Later when I moved to Mumbai, books kind of took a back seat. But I am trying to get back into the habit again, and prefer reading political non-fiction now. In fact, currently, I am writing a book. It’s a series of anecdotal essays that are loosely based on my life. It touches upon aspects such as what it means to be an outsider in Bollywood, mainly focusing on the difficulties and restrictions that an aspiring artiste faces there.It means that you should consider yourself lucky if you manage to get a good role in your first break in Bollywood. But the struggle doesn’t end there. It continues even after you have done one or two more good films, and even further.Nepotism exists in the Hindi film industry, and outsiders are among the worst affected by it. For instance, when I moved to Mumbai, I used to share a room with a college friend and split the bills and other household expenses. These are things that star kids would probably never experience. But by that, I don’t mean that they don’t have their share of stress and struggles. They have to face inter-generational competition and comparisons. Nevertheless, they should acknowledge the privilege they have.I have a fuller life outside of films too. I also devote a lot of time for social causes, like fighting for animal rights and protecting the environment. My friends also ensure that I stay sane and happy.I often travel to the city he is shooting in or he comes down to meet me wherever I am shooting.I used to visit this city often earlier, to meet a very dear friend of mine. We used to then go to Cubbon Park for a jog. I also enjoy eating Mysore Pak on each of my trips here.",life-style,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74084171,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-255042/74084171.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//life-style/books/features/i-am-writing-a-book-on-an-outsiders-struggle-in-bollywood-richa-chadha/articleshow/74084091.cms

16,['12/02/2020'],SC: Explore shield against online derogatory remarks,"This story is from February 12, 2020

NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Tuesday asked the Centre, social media platforms and NGOs to consider devising a mechanism to stop circulation of derogatory comments against institutions like Parliament and the SC on social media.

A bench of Chief Justice S A Bobde and Justices B R Gavai and Surya Kant asked solicitor general Tushar Mehta, senior advocates Kapil Sibal, Sajan Poovayya and Sidharth Luthra for various social media platforms, advocate Aparna Bhat appearing for NGO ‘Prajwala’ and amicus curiae N S Nappinai to discuss the desirability of ridding social media of derogatory comments and unwarranted insinuations against democratic institutions.

The CJI said, “As far as law is concerned, there are two types of comments, one is impersonal while the other is defamatory. There are instances where institutions like Parliament and SC are defamed with derogatory comments. Why should it not be explored how to stop circulation of such comments?”

Sibal said he agreed with the CJI’s view and Mehta said the government would consider it while holding talks with all stakeholders.

This discussion happened in a case taken up by the SC suo motu in 2015 after NGO ‘Prajwala’ wrote a letter to the then CJI drawing the SC’s attention to circulation of child porn and sexual assault videos on social media. The SC’s monitoring had forced the Centre to set up a cyber crime portal for reporting circulation of sexually explicit material, especially child porn and rape videos.

Bhat said the home ministry had not been holding meeting of stakeholders, including the NGO, to devise guidelines and standard operating procedures to eliminate child pornography, rape and gang rape imageries, videos and sites from content hosting platforms and other applications. Mehta said the case was not adversarial and there would be no difficulty in calling a meeting of stakeholders.

Bhat said a new trend was visible on social media platforms where jilted lovers circulated revenge porn — posting intimate pictures of their partner after their relationship soured. “This revenge porn should be stopped the moment it is uploaded as it is not only meant to strip the woman of her dignity but also to defame her in society. Social media platforms take 36 hours to respond to such complaints, by which time the objectionable revenge porn video gets circulated widely,” she said.

Amicus curiae Nappinai said artificial intelligence could be deployed by social media platforms to eliminate offensive and sexually explicit content the moment it got posted on the networks controlled by them. The SC asked all stakeholders to discuss the contentious issues and report back to the court.

18,['12/02/2020'],"Artist, Instagrammer settle dispute","This story is from February 12, 2020

NEW DELHI: The anonymous person behind an Instagram account that had levelled sexual harassment charges against artist Subodh Gupta told the Delhi high court on Tuesday that s/he was unconditionally withdrawing the defamatory content posted on the handle. The anonymous person also expressed regret.

Justice Rajiv Sahai Endlaw noted that the Instagram account holder, who has preferred to remain anonymous, undertook to remove the posts and told the court that the dispute with Gupta had been settled under this condition.

The HC then decreed the defamation suit in favour of the artist and against the holder of the Instagram account“@herdsceneand”, and ended the matter after Gupta’s counsel said he was agreeable to the suit decree and would not press for further removal or blocking of URLs relating to defamatory posts/ articles/ content, apart from those already under court orders.

The HC had earlier asked the account holder whether s/he wanted to represent the anonymous victim in the defamation suit filed by Gupta through advocate Neoma Vasdev.

The court also shot down attempts by the Indian Journalists Union (IJU) to oppose the settlement and questioned its locus. When IJU claimed a decree in favour of Gupta would affect the rights of journalists to write or report the matter, the HC demanded the names of the journalists who want to write or whose rights are affected, but the IJU didn’t give any.

“Once the defendant from whose handle the story emanated has made the statement and expressed regret for the same. IJU can’t claim any right to interfere in the compromise arrived at between the two parties,” Justice Endlaw observed.

For its part, Google, which was also dragged to court by Gupta, said the HC’s earlier directions have been adhered to and it had removed the URLs carrying the defamatory content, but the articles were still available on the host websites of certain media houses and other search engines.

The victim was not arrayed as a party in the case, while the identity of the person running the Instagram account that published the allegations in the wake of the #MeToo movement was kept secret on the court’s directions.

The account holder had earlier said that s/he was only a “whistleblower”, a neutral platform which intended to bring out instances of sexual misconduct and harassment in the arts fraternity, as part of the #MeToo movement, and had not personally been harassed by Gupta.

Justice Endlaw had then made it clear the court could not allow “a ghost and a superghost” and asked the person to decide if the identity of those who levelled the allegations could be revealed so that they could be arrayed as parties to the defamation suit by Gupta against “@herdsceneand”.

In the written statement filed before the court, “@herdsceneand” had claimed that s/he has been a part of the arts fraternity for over 10 years, both in India and abroad, and “cared deeply about the space of women in this profession”.

19,['12/02/2020'],"Now, MCA to be a two-year course","MUMBAI: Master of Computer Application (MCA) will henceforth be a two-year programme—the reduction of one year will largely benefit students and colleges. Classrooms meant for the three-year course will be deployed for other courses and additional faculty could be posted for newer programmes.The decision will be put into effect from the coming academic season. The All India Council of Technical Education (AICTE), which worked with the University Grants Commission to cut the tenure of the three-year MCA course, said the move was prompted by the fact that the number of students coming in from unrelated streams such as commerce, arts and basic sciences had fallen. The decision will see neither the course content being reduced nor will it affect programme hours though.The three-year programme was started in the late 1990s to cater to the large demand from the IT industry that lapped up not only BTech computer science and IT graduates, but even pass-outs from courses such as BSc (information technology), BSc (computer science) and BCA (bachelors in computer application).When the industry demand was still not met, MCA was introduced to allow just about anyone to switch to the computer science stream. Therefore, students from pure sciences and those from commerce and arts with mathematics as a subject also signed up to learn the basics of coding in the first year and then move on to the advanced level in the second. Meanwhile, those from courses such as BSc (IT) or BCA or BSc (CS) got into MCA under the lateral entry system directly into the second year.“But in the last four to five years, the demand for people from the IT industry has fallen; they are recruiting very few people even from BTech computer science and IT. So, there is no admission taking place in the first year of MCA from BSc physics or chemistry or from the BCom course in almost all the colleges in the country,” said AICTE chairman Anil Sahasrabudhe.In the current scenario, MCA courses largely see students with a computer science background join in. These are students who do not need the introductory first year. “So we are repeatedly getting pleas from the colleges that all admissions are in the second year, but because MCA is theoretically a three-year course, colleges have to maintain classrooms and faculty as per the three-year programme. We hence spoke to UGC and they understood the problem and allowed us to make this a two-year programme with inputs of students from BSc IT, CS and BCA,” added Sahasrabudhe.The gates, though, are not closed for students who wish to take the MCA course from other streams. Colleges have been asked to run a short bridge course to bring such students up to speed with the rest.",home,https://static.toiimg.com/photo/msid-47529300/47529300.jpg,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//home/education/now-mca-to-be-a-two-year-course/articleshow/74090182.cms
20,['12/02/2020'],Finance minister Sitharaman cites ‘7 green shoots’ to slam Chidambaram,"This story is from February 12, 2020

Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman speaks in Rajya Sabha during the Budget Session of Parliament, in Ne... Read More

NEW DELHI: Hitting back at former finance minister P Chidambaram for his 'incompetent doctors' overseeing the economy comment, finance minister Nirmala Sitharman on Tuesday said she doesn't want to learn from those who gave “faulty remedies” and under whom FDI literally ran away and “cronies” fled the country after defaulting on bank loans.

Sitharaman defended handling of the economy citing “seven specific green shoots” in rising foreign direct investment (FDI), net foreign portfolio inflows, kicking off of Rs 103 lakh crore infrastructure pipeline, jump in foreign exchange reserves, GST collection topping Rs 1 lakh crore in six months in current fiscal, rebound in industrial production and surge in stock markets.

She first spoke at length in the Lok Sabha, giving out statistics and hard data to defend not just budgetary allocation but also the slippage in fiscal deficit target for the third year in a row. “There are seven important macroeconomic indicators which show that there are green shoots in the economy... economy is not in trouble,” she said replying to the debate on the Budget 2020-21 in the Lower House of Parliament.

To defend her budget for 2020-21, she reeled out announcements of last year including reduction in tax rate on income generated by companies, compared steps taken by the Congress-led UPA during global financial crisis of 2008-09 and took credit for the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) cutting interest rates by as much as 135 basis points last year to boost growth from its worst showing in 11 years.

Speaking later in Rajya Sabha, Sitharaman again took a dig at at Chidambaram saying the fiscal deficit was at a record high during the UPA regime when the economy was being handled by ""competent doctors"".

Chidambaram had said a day earlier that the economy was on the verge of collapse as it was in the hands of “incompetent doctors''. The minister said said FDI ""ran out of the country in 2012-13"" under ""competent doctors"" who were then overseeing the economy and that India's defence was paralysed by lack of equipment under UPA.""We are certainly predisposed about not repeating mistakes of UPA,'' she said, adding there was more sarcasm than content in Chidambaram's criticism of the Union budget.

She also mentioned the twin balance sheet crisis faced by the banks and the mounting NPA and fleeing defaulters. Also, she said, free trade agreements (FTAs) entered into by the UPA were hurting the country.

The finance minister said green shoots of recovery were visible with a rebound in industrial activity and GST collection crossing Rs 1 lakh crore-mark in six months of the current fiscal. Food inflation had not been allowed to cross acceptable thresholds under the Modi government, she said. The minister also said that fiscal discipline was maintained all through under the Narendra Modi government.

“What was the remedy offered in 2008-09 and what did it result in. We certainly don't want that burden on the economy for today or for the future,” she said adding the UPA during 2004 and 2014 was “very fortunate” to inherit a cushion in the good work of Atal Bihari Vajpayee government of the previous five years.

Stating that the government was trying to bring back a number of “cronies” who ran away from the country after taking money from banks, she said: “So that twin balance sheet problem is not something which I would not want to learn from those very competent doctors.”

Again, the NPAs running into lakhs of crores of rupees was a fallout of “another remedy offered during the 2008-09 crisis”. “We certainly do not want to inherit or copy those remedies of competent doctors,” she said and went on to cite double-digit inflation, high fiscal deficit and government liability being passed on to oil companies to dress up the balance sheet as other ills of the UPA era.

24,['12/02/2020'],From the farm to the florist to your Valentine: Tracing the journey of a Valentine's Day rose,"Roses are practically synonymous with Valentine's Day. As we speak to farmers and sellers and trace the journey of a rose, it turns out that due to the high demand on V-Day, customers pay at least 10 times more for a rose than they would pay on any other day of the yearThe tradition of giving roses on Valentine's Day, which started centuries ago, is still alive and thriving among couples across the globe. However, (before giving your Valentine a rose), have you ever thought about the journey of the rose and why it costs you about 10 times more on V-Day? A single-stemmed rose that starts at around Rs 2 at the farm, is sold at the mandi for around Rs 20 and is sold to you by a florist for approximately Rs 200-500 on Valentine's Day. This is the same single-stemmed rose that would cost you Rs 50 on any other day of the year. And don't be surprised if you are charged between Rs 2,000-5,000 instead of Rs 200-400 for a bouquet on Valentine's Day either. Due to the huge demand for roses on Valentine's Day, florists across the capital are expecting a rosy business of over Rs 6-8 crores just on that one day. To get to the bottom of the reason behind this surge in the price of roses around and on Valentine's Day, we traced the journey of V-Day's go-to gift.Location courtesy: TERI rose farm at Gurgaon-Faridabad RoadFarmers, who sell roses to sellers at the mandi, say that Valentine's Day is the biggest day for them as they get to do a lot of business around this timeSumer Bhati, a farmer from Faridabad, says, "" Hum log saal bhar February 14 ka intezaar karte hain kyunki teen maheene ka business ek din mein ho jata hai."" Omveer Singh from Tatarpur village in UP, who also grows roses, adds, ""We don't sell in the market. We send trucks full of roses to Ghazipur Mandi, which is also one of the biggest flower markets of the country. Saal bhar hum log Rs 2-5 ka ek gulaab bechte hain, aur February 12-14 ke beech wohi gulaab Rs 15-20 ka ho jata hai.""Florists at the Ghazipur Mandi buy roses at wholesale prices. These florists then sell to other smaller florists or directly to customers at a higher priceFarmers from Nashik, Pune, Kolkata, Karnal, Hoshiyarpur and Bengaluru also sell their roses at Ghazipur Mandi. When asked about the difference in the price of roses, Sandeep Patra, a seller at Ghazipur Mandi, replies, ""There's no fixed price of roses,"" adding, ""Jitni demand aati hai, utna price badha dete hain. Overall, in Delhi, we are expecting a business of over Rs 6-8 crore on February 14.""On Valentine's Day, the minimum price of a bunch (20 single-stemmed roses) starts Rs 350 at a wholesale price at the Ghazipur Mandi, but when it is sold at florists, the minimum price starts from anything between Rs 1,000-2,000. The vendors in the mandi supply 'love' to not just NCR, but to neighbouring states, too.Florists tell us that wholesale prices on Valentine's Day could go up to Rs 2,500-5,000 for one bouquet of long-stemmed roses. Anubhav Bhasin, a florist in Saket, says, ""This year, be it long or short-stemmed roses, neither will come cheaper. Last year, I sold bouquets for Rs 2,000, but this year, I'm hoping to sell them for around Rs 3,000-5,000 as there is a scarcity of roses due to the elections and wedding season falling at the same time. Also, since it was colder than usual this winter season, farmers had trouble growing roses. If the demand goes up and we are short of supply, the rates might go higher."" He adds, ""For good quality roses, people don't mind paying a higher price on Valentine's Day.""A ROSE FOR MY VALENTINE: Times Fresh Face contestants Diwanshi Kandyal and Pulkit Kohli pose for us near Khan MarketWhile even the love-struck Delhiites find it expensive to pay between Rs 1,000-3,000 for a bunch of roses on Valentine's Day, they say they have no other option. 28-year-old Shubham Pandey, who made an online order for roses a week before Valentine's Day, says, ""I have already placed an order for a bouquet of roses for Valentine's Day and it cost me Rs 1,500, excluding the delivery charges. During any other time of the year, a bunch of roses costs between Rs 200-300, during Valentine's week, it is around Rs 1,000 and on Valentine's Day, it can cost a minimum of Rs 1,500-2,000.

Little did we know then that it was more than just a caption. It was actress Sana Khan ’s way of announcing that her relationship with choreographer Melvin Louis had ended. Days later, and after much insistence, Sana agreed to open up about what went wrong between the couple.She said, “I broke up with Melvin because he was cheating on me. I had loved him with all my heart and was committed to him. What I got in return has disturbed and shaken me. I have developed anxiety issues and am dealing with depression ever since.”They met a year ago and love blossomed between them after a few meetings. Sana recalled, “Initially, everything went on smoothly, but soon, we started fighting over petty issues. But that’s normal in every relationship. However, eight months down the line, I started hearing tales of his philandering ways and cheating from others, but he would tell me that they were jealous.”She added, “A few days ago, I felt that he was up to something. Since I had my doubts, I took his mobile phone, which he snatched back from me and started deleting messages. That’s when I realised that whatever people told me about him was true, and I ended the relationship. In fact, I have come to know that he has already moved on with somebody else. I know who the girl is, but it’s not right on my part to reveal her name.”The actress first sensed something was wrong with their relationship in September 2019, when she suffered from Bell’s Palsy. She said, “I was unwell, but he was barely concerned. I would go around hiding my face with my hair, but he was never by my side. I am happy that God has saved me from this toxic relationship.”While she is determined to move on, Sana is still nursing a broken heart. She said, “I may have walked out of the relationship physically, but mentally and emotionally, I am still in it. I wanted to marry him. I don’t think I can trust any man now.”Despite repeated attempts, we couldn’t reach Melvin for comment.",entertainment,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74081832,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-67854/74081832.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/hindi/bollywood/news/sana-khan-i-broke-up-with-melvin-because-he-was-cheating-on-me/articleshow/74081852.cms

The movie, starring Sara Ali Khan and Kartik Aaryan in the lead, showcases two love stories — one set in the 90s in Udaipur and the other, set in modern-day Delhi. Arushi plays Kartik’s love interest in the former.Interestingly, the first scene that she shot for the film required her to deliver a monologue. That too, in the presence of Kartik, who is known for his monologue in the Pyaar Ka Punchnama series. She recalls, “I was nervous, as I had to deliver a monologue with an actor, who is known for his monologue skills. I felt that I won’t be able to remember my lines, but he made me comfortable and helped me perfect the scene.”Ask her why she took a break after Tamasha and Arushi says that she gave several auditions for other filmmakers, but was rejected. And then, she received a call from Imtiaz’s team for this film. Talking about her first meeting with the filmmaker, the Shimla girl says, “The first time I met Imtiaz sir was when he had come to my college for a recce. He then approached me for Tamasha, and during the course of the shoot, I realised that I wanted to pursue acting. However, I did not want to quit engineering and so, I continued with my studies and would come to Mumbai only for auditions. With my second film, I feel like I am living a dream. I hope people love and appreciate my work.”About her experience of working with Imtiaz and Kartik, Arushi shares, “I love the way Imtiaz sir improvises a scene. The scene that comes to my mind is the one shown in the trailer — Kartik and I are at a fort and a security guard is rude to us. Imtiaz sir suggested a lot of on-the-spot changes to that scene. In the movie, Kartik and I portray the couple from ‘kal’ and their chemistry is very different from the lovers of ‘aaj’. That kind of romance doesn’t exist anymore, love is more practical these days. I am sure Imtiaz sir would have done romantic stuff like this (laughs!). As far as Kartik is concerned, I am thankful to him for making me comfortable on the sets. He helped me understand the technicalities and pushed me to do better. I shot with Kartik for a month and he has been a very supportive and caring co-star.”",entertainment,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74081615,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-70871/74081615.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/hindi/bollywood/news/arushi-sharma-with-love-aaj-kal-i-feel-like-i-am-living-a-dream/articleshow/74081615.cms

When prodded what made him think of extending his support for water management, he responded, “We’ve failed to do things for the nation. So many things could have been done. Personally, in my new studio, we’re trying to install natural cooling system, rainwater harvesting and so on.”

Going back in time, the two-time Grammy Awards winner recalled, “All I can think of water from my younger days is that my whole house used to leak then. We would keep buckets next to where we would sleep on the mat. We had to cross a huge pond to reach our school. There would be knee-deep water.” He quipped, “So, my dream has always been to have sunshine and that’s why I named my orchestra Sunshine Orchestra.” As he walked around the venue, taking a look at the panels and installations, he said, “I am working on a project in Hollywood called Hands Around the World, which is on global warming.”

Delhi BJP office on the Delhi polls results day (PTI)

NEW DELHI: BJP’s sub-par performance in state elections post the Lok Sabha polls has served to underline the importance of state leaders in the contests, either by way of their absence or the burden of incumbency due to an unpopular chief minister.

BJP has sought to bring national issues centrestage in assembly polls, arguing the Modi government has taken a number of decisive steps since its re-election such as abrogation of Jammu and Kashmir’s special status, passage of the Citizenship Amendment Act and several measures to boost the economy.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi and home minister Amit Shah have emphasised the benefits of a “double engine” with BJP governments in the state and the Centre. The gambit has paid mixed results, indicating the Modi effect can help the party in a state poll, but this is not enough if there is no state mascot or one that has lost popular appeal.

BJP’s wins in states like Jharkhand and Haryana, and its emergence as the single largest party in Maharashtra, after the 2014 Lok Sabha elections could be attributed to Modi’s rise on the national scene and expectations that the party would deliver at the state level. This gave BJP an opportunity to make unconventional choices for the CM’s post, even ignoring traditional caste considerations.

Five years down the line, the performance of BJP governments is under scrutiny. In Haryana, chief minister Manohar Lal was seen to have delivered on infrastructure and services, but faced a strong backlash from Jats upset over being dealt out of the power equation. In Maharashtra, the BJP-Sena alliance won, but with lesser than expected numbers. Nonetheless, a victory turned into defeat due to Sena’s desertion.

While Maharashtra is an unusual aberration, Jharkhand saw BJP paying the price for failing to seal an alliance with its partner AJSU and former chief minister Raghubar Das’s image as a gruff individual. A record relatively free of scams did not help Das and BJP lost the election comprehensively to JMM and Congress.

The challenge in Delhi was stiffer, given its urbanised character, television debates and widespread use of social media. Lack of a face to counter Arvind Kejriwal as CM hurt BJP and Modi’s promise of faster development and Shah’s roadshows and rallies attacking AAP for supporting Shaheen Bagh protests failed to stop AAP. Though the collapse of Congress was a major factor in AAP’s success, BJP fell short by a crucial 4-6% votes.

Interestingly, BJP has not lacked state leaders. The triumvirate of Shivraj Singh Chouhan, Raman Singh and Vasundhara Raje has served BJP well. Chouhan and Singh scored repeat wins in Madhya Pradesh and Chhattishgarh. But the wages of incumbency and perceptions of a coterie calling the shots hurt them.

BJP has a new crop of state leaders in Yogi Adityanath, Jai Ram Thakur in Himachal Pradesh, Trivendra Singh Rawat in Uttarakhand, Sarbananda Sonowal and Himanta Sarma in Assam, Biplab Deb in Tripura and Devendra Fadnavis in Maharashtra. There is also B S Yediyurappa, the old warhorse in Karnataka, and Vijay Rupani in Gujarat. But the party now needs new names elsewhere or could find itself struggling.

NEW DELHI: A Delhi court on Tuesday sentenced Brajesh Singh Thakur — who ran a children’s home in Bihar’s Muzaffarpur district where 44 girls were sexually exploited — and five others to imprisonment for the rest of their lives and slapped Thakur with a fine of over Rs 32 lakh for committing sexual crimes.

Additional sessions judge Saurabh Kulshreshtha also sentenced five convicts in the case to life imprisonment while handing 10-year jail terms to six others. Two more persons got relatively minor sentences.

Thakur and 18 others, including nine women, were convicted on January 20 of committing or abetting sexual assault on 44 minor girls at the Muzaffarpur shelter.

The court said Thakur was the de-facto owner of the home, and managed and controlled its affairs. The 156-page sentencing order said this was not a solitary case of rape but a “meticulously planned” and “ingeniously executed” conspiracy where care-givers and administrators in the shelter home turned into “predators”.

The order noted that the minor girls were subjected to aggravated penetrative sexual assault over a span of about four years.

Calling Thakur the “kingpin” of the conspiracy, the court said, “The convict is not a young boy, but a mature, experienced politician charged with a plethora of crimes.”

Thakur, who was expected to display compassion and sobriety, betrayed the trust and faith of the girls living there, the judge observed. “It is not a fit case for adopting the reformative and therapeutic approach,” argued the court.

“In this era, where protection of the girl child and emancipation of women are avowed societal objectives, it is lamentable that the minor girls housed in a state-monitored and state-funded children’s home... were subjected to such horrendous acts,” the court observed.

Given the rising number of sexual crimes against children, the offences had to be dealt with an iron hand to send a strong message and deter others from committing such heinous crimes, it added.

Along with Thakur, the court, dealing with cases under the Protection of Children against Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act, sentenced Ravi Kumar Roshan, a child protection officer in Muzaffarpur who was entrusted with the responsibility of inspecting and supervising the functioning of the shelter home, to serve the rest of his life behind bars. Likewise, Vikas Kumar and Dilip Kumar, both members of the local child welfare committee (CWC), were sentenced to life imprisonment for “the remainder of natural life”.

Two employees of Thakur, Guddu Patel and Vijay Kumar Tiwari, were also sentenced to life terms for the remainder of their lives for “committing gang rape on multiple occasions”. The court observed that Tiwari would “physically assist” Thakur in committing sexual crimes by gagging the victims and grabbing their hands. Thakur’s servant, Krishan Kumar, was awarded a life term.

Three women convicts – Minu Devi, Kiran Kumari and Shaista Praveen – were also given life imprisonment for abetting rape, along with Ramanuj Thakur.

The court sentenced Rama Shankar, Aswini, Manju Devi, Chanda Devi, Neha Kumari and Hema Masih to 10 years in prison, and Indu Kumari to a three-year jail term.

Indu, Minu, Hema and Kiran were shelter home employees.

Convict Rosy Rani, additional director at the child protection unit of the social welfare department, was convicted under Section 21(1) (failure to report commission of an offence) of the Pocso Act. She was awarded is six months, which she had already served.

The court on January 20 convicted Thakur and 18 others for offences including section 120 b (criminal conspiracy) and abetment, besides section 323 (voluntarily causing hurt) and 21 (failure to report commission of an offence) of the Pocso Act, as well as section 75 (cruelty to child) of the Juvenile Justice Act.

To prove its case, the prosecution had examined 69 witnesses whereas the defence examined 20 witnesses. The CBI in its chargesheet alleged that 44 girl inmates of the home were administered sleep-inducing drugs in the garb of de-worming medicines. When the girls fell unconscious, the accused sexually assaulted them. The case was transferred from Bihar to a special court in Saket, Delhi, after a Supreme Court order on February 7, 2019.

The matter was handed over to the CBI in July, 2018 and filed a chargesheet against 21 accused in the case in December 2018.

Thakur and seven women office bearers of his NGO, Seva Sankalp Evam Vikas Samiti, had been sent to jail on June 3, 2018 after an FIR was lodged in the case.

36,['12/02/2020'],Assam NRC data vanishes from cloud,"This story is from February 12, 2020

Assam has seen huge protests over NRC (File photo)

GUWAHATI: Assam's updated NRC data, including the particulars of all applicants included or excluded from the final citizenship rolls published on August 31, has disappeared from the official website of the state coordinator of national registration. The complete list containing 3.11 crore inclusions and 19.06 lakh exclusions had been uploaded to the website nrcassam.nic.in in October on the orders of the Supreme Court.

An NRC official claimed the data wasn't visible as the cloud-storage subscription lapsed sometime ago and couldn't be renewed because the new state NRC coordinator who replaced Prateek Hajela hadn't taken charge then.

""The subscription renewal for cloud storage provided by Wipro wasn't done on time because Hajela was transferred. Now that a new coordinator (Hitesh Dev Sarma) has assumed charge, the renewal process is underway. The data should be online in a few days,"" he said.

Wipro couldn't be reached for comment. Leader of opposition Debabrata Saikia on Tuesday wrote to the registrar general and census commissioner, requesting him to unravel the ""mystery"" behind ""online data vanishing all of a sudden"". He said it was shocking that the data had vanished even before the appeals process could start, for which he blamed the ""go-slow attitude adopted by the NRC authority"".

“There is, therefore, ample scope to suspect that the disappearance of online data is a mala fide act and is prima facie a deliberate violation of the directive issued by the Supreme Court,” the letter states.

38,['12/02/2020'],"Delhi elections: BJP believes CAA boosted vote share, won’t back down","NEW DELHI: Its debacle in Delhi may be seen by many as a rebuff to the controversial Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA), but BJP does not intend to back down from its plan to use the new law as one of its key planks.The BJP leadership believes the focus on CAA was the reason why its vote share improved by over 6% . Party officials also said the popularity of CAA or otherwise was not an issue in Delhi because of Arvind Kejriwal’s tactical ambiguity over both the law and the opposition it has drawn. “He skated around it and towards the last stage of the campaign, appeared to blame the Shaheen Bagh disruption on protesters,” said a highly placed party official.The party is expected to pitch CAA as a major issue in forthcoming elections, not the least because its opponents in Bihar, West Bengal, Assam and Kerala have been aggressively adversarial towards the law.“Support for CAA is widespread and growing, and will help in framing future battles as contests over the issue of whether India should provide citizenship to Hindus and other religious minorities who have been victims of persecution in neighbouring Islamic countries,” the official said.The fog of confusion created by disinformation and shrewd tactics like the display of Constitution has been cleared and now people have clarity about the religious nature of protests like the one at Shaheen Bagh and that is going to help,” the official added.In Bihar, BJP may have to contend with its ally, CM and JD(U) boss Nitish Kumar, who would like to campaign on the governance plank which he has sought to strengthen by working hard to reach piped water to every household and with an ambitious campaign to renew water bodies.Sources in the BJP acknowledged that while Kumar has supported CAA, he may not share their enthusiasm about the law. But that may not stop CAA from becoming a major issue in the election because of the vehemence with which RJD has opposed the law. “In any case, BJP will be running its own campaign in the seats it will contest,” said one of them.",elections,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74094126,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-183702,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//elections/assembly-elections/delhi/bjp-believes-caa-boosted-vote-share-wont-back-down/articleshow/74090698.cms

In the 2015 Delhi Assembly elections, Khan had defeated Singh by a margin of 64,532. While the margin by which Khan had won last time was also huge, the biggest difference has been in the fortunes of Congress.In 2015, Asif Mohd Khan of Congress had garnered 20,135 votes but this time three-time Congress MLA Parvez Hashmi got just 5,107 votes. In the Muslim-dominated Okhla constituency, Khan got 66% vote share, while the once popular Congress got just 2.5%!Okhla is important as Shaheen Bagh, epicentre of the protests against the anti-Citizenship Amendment Act, is part of the constituency. While AAP focused on the development plank, Shaheen Bagh was used as a polarising poll plank by BJP across the city. AAP didn't take a clear stand on the anti-CAA protests and kept a safe distance from Shaheen Bagh while Congress was vocal against CAA and NRC. In its manifesto, Congress had promised to pass a resolution in Delhi Assembly against CAA and ask the central government to withdraw it.

NEW DELHI: Official orders served upon former J&K CMs Omar Abdullah and Mehbooba Mufti while seeking their detention under the Public Safety Act (PSA) have not included phrases such as ""radical ideology"" and ""daddy's girl"" that were part of the dossiers sent by J&K Police.

A PSA order is made out of three instruments - a magistrate's report, prosecution order and a police dossier.

The final order by the Srinagar administration has also kept out the contention made by J&K police against Abdullah that ""he was able to convince his electorate to come out and vote in huge numbers during peak of militancy and poll boycott..."".

Earlier, Abdullah's ""radical methodology"" and ""capacity to influence people"" had been cited in a police dossier as the reason for his detention being extended by three months under PSA. This was reported in TOI on Monday. The dossier on Mufti had labeled her ""daddy's girl"" who ""glorified terrorists after death"" .

PDP spokesman and Mufti aide, Naeem Akhtar, was charged - among other things - for ""advising people to read Hurriyat Conference chairman Syed Ali Geelani's book 'Wullar Kinarey'.""

The latest orders continue to hold Mufti and Abdullah accountable for ""making provocative speeches, encouraging mass agitation against nullification of Article 370 and instigating public against the unity and integrity of the nation"". While the PSA order by the Srinagar district magistrate, dated February 5, on Mufti now includes 15 controversial statements attributed to her, the one on Abdullah barely runs into two-pages.

""Wherever necessary, the PSA order is issued after examining the magistrate's report, the prosecution report, the police dossier etc. Depending from case to case, sometimes inputs are omitted in the order but preserved in records to be presented before honourable courts in sealed covers, whenever called for (sic),"" an official said.

(With inputs from Saleem Pandit in Srinagar)

They are bechare (poor people) and I hope they will learn from it. If a handful of people doesn't like it then it doesn't matter because 1.3 billion people liked the decision, so who are they? They should be kept aside,"" said Sami.""The most important thing is that the field in which I have been given this blessing of an award is art and music. I feel my responsibility towards my fans, my country is through my profession, which is music,"" said the singe, at the launch of his new song 'Tu yaad aya' in Mumbai.He continued: ""So, apart from being a responsible citizen in general, my responsibility is to ensure that I give my best through my profession, which is music, for which I have been honoured, and try and excel and give back even more of my love through music.""Adnan Sami was given Padma Shri on India's 71st Republic Day. The Home Ministry had released a list of 118 people including Sami. The award recognised Sami's contribution to art in India.",entertainment,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74090866,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-81610/74090866.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/hindi/music/news/adnan-sami-on-padma-shri-flak-okay-if-they-didnt-like-it/articleshow/74090864.cms

PATNA: The state police headquarters has set up a four-member team to probe the explosion in a Salimpur Ahra house in the state capital, which had left seven people, including six members of a family and a neighbour, injured on Monday. The team headed by ADG (CID) Vinay Kumar will find out the cause of explosion and assess the damages to the buildings, ADG (headquarters) Jitendra Kumar said on Tuesday. The police headquarters, however, didn’t specify any time limit for the probe team to submit its report.

The probe team visited the site on Tuesday and inquired about the incident. ADG (CID) Vinay Kumar also talked to the injured at PMCH.

Police sources said an FIR was lodged with Gandhi Maidan police station in connection with the explosion under Sections 285, 279, 337, 338, 436 and 307 of IPC. Prima facie it was found that the explosion took place in the house of Arjun Sao due to leakage of gas from an LPG cylinder.

A joint team of state forensic science laboratory (FSL) and anti-terrorism squad (ATS) had collected samples from the site. However, the forensic experts didn’t find any evidence of explosion due to explosive substance. Even the doctors attending to the victims had ruled out injuries caused to them due to explosives, said Patna SSP Upendra Kumar Sharma.

“So prima facie we are of the opinion that the incident was a result of leakage of LPG cylinder,” Sharma said.

The SSP said one of the victims, an old woman, had received over 50% burn injuries in the incident. The condition of other injured admitted to the PMCH was stated to be out of danger. He said the FIR was lodged against unidentified persons on the statement of Baidyanath Mahto, an autorickshaw driver, who was staying with his family in the rented flat where explosion took place. Mahto, his wife, mother and three children were injured.

Injured woman dies: Gangajali Devi (70), who had suffered burn injuries in the explosion in her rented accommodation at Salimpur Ahra under Gandhi Maidan police station on Monday, died during treatment at the PMCH on Tuesday. Police said Gangajali had suffered more than 50% burn injuries.

50,['12/02/2020'],Patna airport restricts entry of 3-wheelers from outside,"This story is from February 12, 2020

Flyers outside Patna airport on Tuesday

PATNA: The Jayaprakash Narayan International Airport has introduced a free e-rickshaw service that will carry passengers from the entry gate to the pick up and drop off area. Hence, no three-wheeler from outside will be allowed to ply on the premises of the airport.

According to airport officials, the step has been taken to get rid of traffic congestion, which occurs due to space crunch near the pick up and drop off area and the parking slot.

Airport director Bhupesh C H Negi told this newspaper on Tuesday, “Many autos restrict the smooth flow of traffic by standing in front of the airport’s parking slot, entry or exit gates and terminal building. Prohibiting their entry will streamline traffic movement on the airport premises.”

Negi added, “We have stationed altogether 10 e-rickshaws on the premises of the airport. They will carry passengers from the entry gate to the departure gate of the terminal building and from the arrival gate of the building to the exit gate.”

The free e-rickshaw service is likely to continue till the new terminal building of the airport, which is under construction, comes up. “This temporary restriction on three-wheelers will be lifted once the new terminal building is ready with additional parking space,” Negi said.

Meanwhile, flyers welcomed the initiative taken by the airport authorities. NIFT-Patna student Saloni Gupta usually hires an auto to reach the airport. “The free e-rickshaw service is great because cab and auto drivers charge extra money for picking up or dropping off passengers near the terminal building,” she said.

The drivers of three-wheelers, on the other hand, are quite upset with the decision. Surendra Kumar , an auto driver, rued, “Restricting our entry is nothing, but injustice. Private cabs should also not be allowed to enter the airport.”

Three new flights from March 29: As part of the summer schedule of the city airport, low-cost carrier, SpiceJet, is set to introduce three new flights from Patna to Jaipur, Guwahati and Amritsar from March 29.

The Patna-Jaipur (via Varanasi) flight (SG-2752/2753) will arrive at the Patna airport at 5.35pm, depart for Varanasi at 5.55pm and reach Jaipur at 9.10pm. On the other hand, the Guwahati-Patna-Guwahati flight (SG-425/426) will land at the Patna airport at 7.15am and depart at 8.20pm.

The Amritsar-Patna-Amritsar flight (SG-2758/2759) will reach Patna at 11.35am and leave for Amritsar at 11.55am. This is the second direct flight between Patna and Amritsar. The first one was started by Air India last year.

51,['12/02/2020'],This startup to tackle wet waste management in city,"This story is from February 12, 2020

Streamlining: Pot composting unit developed by Ramakrishna Mission that its startup will install in apartments... Read More

Mangaluru: Ramakrishna Mission has launched a startup dedicated to handling wet waste, Mangala Resource Management Institute . Spurred by havoc wrought by the sliding down of waste from the landfill at Pachchanady into Mandarabailu in the monsoon, the startup is striving to ensure zero wet waste is put in the landfill.

Based on the idea of pot composting, the startup will handle wet waste that apartments in the city generate daily. Each household in the apartment must pay a monthly fee of Rs 150 and one-time deposit of Rs 1,000, that will be returned at the end of the third year. Volunteers of the startup will put the household wet waste in a pot compost unit, cover it with a layer of coconut husk, and return the waste bins that will be given with the unit to households.

The units will be placed in parking lots of apartments against pillars in an unobtrusive manner, noted Swami Ekagamyananda, convener of Swachh Mangaluru campaign, that the mission ran in the city for five years from 2015. “The startup is an extension of the campaign and is a response to queries from people who were keen to know what our next step of the campaign was,” Swami Ekagamyananda, who announced the launch of the startup, said on Tuesday.

“The startup is also in response to a directive from the Mangaluru City Corporation (MCC) to all bulk generators of wet waste, including apartments with more than 20 dwelling units, to handle it on their own or face a penalty as per the directive given by the National Green Tribunal,” said Swami Ekagamyananda. “Most of our queries were from resident welfare associations of flats with dwelling units exceeding the norm fixed by MCC,” he said.

The pot composting unit has three made to design pots and comes with an iron guard. The startup will give two small plastic waste bins for the households to alternate their wet waste with the clean bin. Black soldier fly that are attracted to such waste convert it into manure, which the startup is ready to buy back, he said. This novel startup will also ensure that the potters have ample opportunities to earn their livelihood by supplying pots, he said.

While Ramakrishna Mission had mooted the idea of pot composting as part of phase 4 and 5 of the campaign, and had targeted to install pots in 4,000 households, it received bookings for 4,719 pots. The mission thus far has distributed 2,800 pots and 2,500 households are using it effectively, he said. “We are videographing and archiving these success stories,” he said, adding efforts are on to source pots from diverse vendors for this new venture.

In June 2010, petrol prices were opened up to market prices, with state owned retailers told to revise prices once a fortnight. Subsequently, diesel prices were deregulated in October 2014 and which was followed by opening up both for daily price revisions by retailers.Between April and December, private sector companies operated 7,203 pumps, of which 630 of them were added by Essar and Shell while Reliance didn’t add any in that period. India had 67,440 fuel stations as of December 2019, an increase of nearly 4%.“Nearly 50% of our products and revenues comes from retail operations from petrol pumps. We will fiercely guard our territory and will not yield any ground to any one,” said P Jayadevan, executive director of TN & Puducherry of Indian Oil Corporation. He said that his office was processing new pump applications from nearly 2,000 applicants and he expected at least a fourth of them to start operations over the next year. “We have already issued 250 letter of intent (LoI) from new applicants across the state and work is progress,” he said. “We are leaders in that space, we will not slacken.”Be that as it may, between April and March, Essar opened 600 new stations across India. Shell operated 175 pumps as of December 2019 as against 145 in March. “Shell Retail has been consistently growing its presence in India. We are now present in over 40 cities and towns across the country. We have expanded our network in existing cities like Bengaluru, Chennai, Ahmedabad. and have also entered new cities like Hubli-Dharwad, Coimbatore, Nashik, Bhavnagar, Jamnagar to name a few,” a Shell India spokesperson said. Reliance fuel network remained stagnant at 1,400 outlets between April and December. “There has been a slowdown in new vehicle sales over the past few. But, the long term prospects are still promising. Besides, newer avenues like opening battery swapping operations for electric vehicles in existing outlets throws in an opportunity to catch the EV space too,” a marketing official at BPCL said. State owned oil marketers pay dealers a commission of Rs 3.2 per litre of petrol and Rs 2.25 a litre of diesel.

53,['12/02/2020'],Component industry in wait and watch mode as Chinese firms open on Feb 10,"This story is from February 12, 2020

Chennai: With China opening supplies from February 10, the auto component industry is keeping fingers crossed with the hope that inventory situation will improve in coming days. According to component companies however currently affected factories are expected to function at one-third capacity and if things don’t ease up going forward production lines could still be hit. So far, the stock built up before the lunar holiday continues to run for parts makers. Meanwhile component companies which have offices and factories in China — like the Motherson Group for example — are also routing supplies like face masks to Shanghai via Dubai.

“The factories were supposed to open from February 10 but most have started with about 30%-35% attendance. This is likely to go up to 50% in next few days. The backlog is slowly clearing up but we will know the scenario in next few days when the first lots of parts reach airports,” said Hemant Sikka, president-CPO, Powerol & spares business, M&M.

For Indian parts companies that means a definite production disruption. India imports auto parts worth $4 billion though a large part of those parts hit the after market as well. “We have set up a command centre in Shanghai and are getting daily updates (for our operations there). We are sending masks from Dubai. Optically volumes could be impacted due to shortage of parts from China. February 10 was the finishing of the lunar calendar but it is yet to be seen when the Chinese factories open and send materials. A lot of tier 2, tier 3 suppliers and car makers are also going on with lunar holidays (stock). Other than our plants and the people over there, everything depends on how long it gets prolonged. Some suppliers have issued force majeure notices to the OEMs in the US but we have not got any force majeure notices,” said Vivek Chaand Sehgal, chairman, Motherson Group during an investor call on Monday.

Component industry sources say much will also depend on how individual parts makers manage their value chain. “There are alternate suppliers and sometimes the same supplier may have an alternate manufacturing site which is not in the core affected area,” said a top industry official. “The big problem will be with electronic and electrical parts which can hold up the assembly line.” Industry body ACMA however is in wait and watch mode. “Coronavirus is a global risk but it is currently too early to say just how badly India will be hit. Some global MNC suppliers have invoked force majeure clause as per their global policy as a preventive but for us it is still too early to assess the exact impact,” said ACMA president Deepak Jain of Lumax.

54,['12/02/2020'],Family biz must respect top execs’ views for best results,"This story is from February 12, 2020

By Ronesh Puri

Over 80% of businesses worldwide are family-owned. In India, it is estimated that 90% of the businesses are family-owned, and about 80% of the NSE’s m-cap is with such enterprises.

It is a matter of pride for Indians that as many as 12 Indian businesses made it to the list of 50 most profitable family-owned businesses in Asia. Therefore, they are far important than is commonly believed. As larger MNCs hit the headlines more, a number of professionals do not realise that opportunities in a family-owned business can be very lucrative.

Candidates specialising in working for a family-owned business can command a huge premium as well as have far more opportunities open to them because the size of the cake is far bigger. From the owners’ standpoint, the true potential of an organisation is only realised when organisations have professionals helping take the company to the next level.

Look at some of the most successful organisations today — they grow exponentially when they truly professionalise. However, it is very important for the owners to realise that the organisation will grow far faster if they ensure some of the points enumerated below. Most of the top family-owned businesses have done the following:

* Give adequate empowerment: It is not easy for owners to trust a professional easily, and that too immediately. Therefore, sometimes it can take a while for sufficient trust to develop. However, it is very important for an owner to understand that a professional will only be able to give results if he/she is trusted and sufficiently empowered. Building trust and giving sufficient confidence to a candidate that their talent is respected and they can change the status quo is very important. Several candidates complain that the feeling they get from the owner is, though they want quick results, they are not so happy with making far-reaching changes. Owners must realise that unless the status quo is changed, results will not be very different. It is therefore prudent to concentrate on results, leaving the how of it to be the prerogative of the professional. Best is to give empowerment with accountability.

* Respect the professional & his/her views: It is very important for the owner to treat a professional with respect and encourage the professional to speak freely. Fear of expressing an opinion or speaking their mind must be prevented. Owners tend to have ‘yes’ men around them who rarely speak their mind. Therefore, an atmosphere of open communication must be established by the owners by encouraging a professional to speak freely and even challenge their thinking. A number of organisations are starved of great talent because their organisations have a very subservient culture and, unfortunately, a perception exists that talent is neither respected nor is the freedom to speak freely given. A culture where professionals are respected and encouraged to speak freely gets best outcomes.

* Communicate clearly what is expected: It has been my experience of working with over 100 family-owned organisations that, very often, there is a gap in communicating clearly what indeed are the expectations and what are the dos and don’ts. A number of organisations presume that a candidate is well aware of the same when in reality there is fuzziness on this. Ideally, after a month, there should be a discussion with the candidate on the expectations and everything should be in black-and-white, leaving no room for lack of clarity on this. Also, if there are behavioural, cultural and style of management preferences, it is great if these are communicated by the owner directly as it helps if the rules of the games are clearly spelt out.

* Getting top talent without cost constraint: Whenever a small- or mid-sized company moves to the next level, a call that needs to be taken is — Should they get the best talent with cost constraint or without? Most family-owned companies start with employees who are loyal and can be trusted. They normally are not the most qualified or paid high salaries. Though it is not necessary that the most expensive candidate is the best, it must also be realised that paying more for a better candidate is far more prudent than compromising and hiring the second-best because of a cost constraint. Ability to innovate and hire anybody at any price is an advantage that family-owned businesses enjoy. So, it’s best to leverage on this key differentiator. You will notice that family-owned businesses that have grown exponentially have often taken the hard call to hire the best and then the company has just moved onto another trajectory. Business is all about having the best talent. The company with the best talent has the best chance of winning.

Family-owned businesses are great to work for as there is so much that one can do and accomplish. However, owners must realise that they need to empower the candidate, respect the individual and encourage them to voice their views as well as make the changes.

Owners must articulate their expectations clearly as well as be obsessed with hiring the best talent for their company, who will adjust to their ecosystem well. Many more organisations can be taken to the next level if they have the best talent.

55,['12/02/2020'],372 objections pour into civic body’s election office,"This story is from February 12, 2020

Aurangabad: The civic administration’s election department has received as many as 372 objections on ward reservations and formation for the AMC elections, 2020.

A large number of corporators and aspiring candidates queued up before the AMC’s election office on Tuesday, which was the last day for filing objections. Former corporator Sameer Rajurkar spoke about the objections he had at a press conference on Tuesday. Deputy mayor Rajendra Janjal and several aspiring candidates were present.

Rajurkar said that certain people had been in the municipal corporation for years and that the interference of a few influential people had made it difficult for a common man to ever win an election. “The confidentiality required in the process of ward formation has been breached in the AMC ward formation. The EC’s criterion of ensuring atleast 10,671 residents in each ward has been violated,” Rajurkar said.

Vinod Ghosalkar, the communication head of Shiv Sena who was in the city on Tuesday, said that the officebearers of the AMC have not expressed a major discontent over the ward reservation process. “The criteria of population seems to have been violated in certain wards, while some wards have the same reservation like the previous term. A combined report will be prepared considering all the objections and will be sent to guardian minister Subhash Desai, who will place it before chief minister Uddhav Thackeray,” Ghosalkar said. Now that the window for receiving objections has been closed, the remaining plaints will be sent to the state election commission. The CM will take a call on the objections after the election commission hears the complaints.

In 2015, 303 objections had poured in for the elections for the Aurangabad Municipal Corporation (AMC).

57,['12/02/2020'],Patna: Private schools told to upload fee structure to their sites,"This story is from February 12, 2020

Representative Image

PATNA: The principals of private schools have been asked to get websites ready by March 31 and upload their fee structure for the next academic year, Patna divisional commissioner Sanjay Kumar Agarwal said on Tuesday.

“The websites should be updated for parents to get all required information about the schools, including admission fees, development charge, list of books, dresses and other facilities,” he said.

The regional deputy director of education (RDDE), Surendra Sinha , was instructed to keep a check on the increment in fee of private schools. “If a school has increased its fee beyond the prescribed limit, then parents, students and even teachers can complain about it to the RDDE. They can also raise fee-related issue or lodge complaints through email to rdde.patna@gmail.com,” he said.

“Schools are not allowed to increase their fees more than 7%. Action would be taken under Bihar Private School Fees Regulations Act, if they are caught doing so. However, those who want to increase the fee, will have to submit documents with appropriate reasons to the Fee Regulatory Committee six months prior to the new academic session,” he said.

Furthermore, all private schools were advised to submit the details of fee structure during academic session 2019-20 and 2020-21 to district education officer (DEO) Jyoti Kumar.

The DEO has been asked to hold meetings with the registration committee of private schools every month. “A software should be developed for registration of students in private schools,” Agarwal said.

The directives were issued in regulation to Bihar Private Schools (Fee Regulation) Act, 2019, passed by the legislative assembly in February last year. “In the last academic session (2018-19), no complaint was received from parents about the fee charged by schools in violation to the Act,” Agarwal said.

Meanwhile, parents hailed the new directives. Saguna Mor resident Sanjay Singh said: “It is a major sigh of relief for me. I have always been worried due to illogical increase in my son’s school fee structure.”

58,['12/02/2020'],Temporary sump houses will come up in Patna before monsoon: UDHD,"This story is from February 12, 2020

Anand Kishor

PATNA: Two dozen new sump houses will be temporarily made ready before the onset of monsoon in the state capital this year. Also, the nine major drains and four underground drains will be cleaned by an outsourced agency in three phases, Urban Development and Housing Department (UDHD) secretary Anand Kishor said on Tuesday.

He was briefing the media regarding steps taken to tackle waterlogging problem in the city during monsoon. Kishor said the instruction to construct 17 new sump houses was given by the high-level committee formed by the government in October last year to find out the cause behind unprecedented waterlogging and its remedies. Apart from that, UDHD has earmarked 12 other places for the construction of new sump houses, of which seven will be made functional before this monsoon.

“It takes 12 to 18 months to complete a sump house. Hence, a raised platform will be made and motors will be installed on it as a short-term measure. There will be a well-like structure with inlet and outlet for drainage of water. This will start working before the monsoon,” said Kishor.

UDHD has also tasked Bihar Urban Infrastructure Development Corporation Limited (BUIDCO) to finish the civil work related to 38 old sump houses by June. It had allocated Rs10 crore for that. The department is also coordinating with the energy department to install feeder in all the existing sump houses by June this year.

Taking a lesson from last year’s waterlogging, all the sump houses will have additional motors and there will also be diesel motors to be used in case of power cut. The existing sump houses will be operated and maintained by the private agencies. “Tender has been done recently. Apart from operating, contract for annual maintenance and repair for three years will soon be awarded,” said Kishor.

Since the committee found slush in the major drains as one of the reasons for waterlogging, Kishor said these drains will be cleaned by private agencies in three stages during pre-monsoon, monsoon and post monsoon. “We are benchmarking the depth of major drains at every 100 metres. A joint team of the district administration and Patna Municipal Corporation will inspect the drainage cleaning with the help of this benchmarking. Payment will be released to the agency only after the inspection. Strict action will be taken against those who are found responsible for any lapses,” he added.

Apart from major drains, nine underground drains on which UDHD is focusing this time include the one from Kautilya Nagar to Nepali Nagar, Hartali Mor to Rajapur Pul, SK Puri to Anandpuri via Mohanpur sump house and from CDA Building to Saidpur sump house. Sources said there was no record of these underground drains being cleaned earlier and super-suction machines will be purchased to clean them. The small drains will be handled by the Patna Municipal Corporation.

It will also develop new payments methods, standards and technologies and spend on raising awareness of payments systems.In India, currently, the NPCI is the only entity that provides an ecosystem for payments. The NPCI operates the RuPay and Unified Payments Interface (UPI) networks. It links all the ATMs of different banks to one network and manages other forms of electronic payments. Although it was carved out from the RBI, the NPCI is today a banks-owned non-profit company.Last month, in its policy paper on new payments systems, the RBI had highlighted the risks of a monopoly. These included a single point of failure that makes the entity too big to fail, and lack of competition that results in fewer innovations and inefficiencies. The RBI has now published a draft framework for the setting up of a ‘new umbrella entity’ focusing on retail payments to be authorised under the Payment and Settlement Systems Act 2007.The RBI has said that the new entity must be ‘owned and controlled’ by residents with three years’ experience in the payments ecosystem as either a payments system operator, payments services provider, or technology services provider. The shareholding will need to be diversified and any entity with more than 25% shareholding will be considered a promoter.Foreign investment will be allowed subject to existing guidelines and approval from a competent authority to be identified by the department of industrial policy and promotion (DIPP) under the Foreign Exchange Management Act (FEMA). The promoters of the new entity will be subject to RBI’s fit and proper guidelines.Justifying the need for high capital, the RBI said that the new entity must start with Rs 500 crore to address the need of capital for managing risks, technological infrastructure and business operations. However, no single promoter or promoter group can hold over 40% and a minimum net worth of Rs 300 crore must be maintained at all times.",business,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74096041,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-60263,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/e-pay-platform-npci-to-face-competition/articleshow/74090194.cms

Ahmedabad: A city sessions court on Tuesday granted conditional bail to Danilimda municipal councillor Shehzadkhan Pathan and four others, 54 days after they were arrested in connection with the violence that broke out during protests against the new citizenship law in Shah-e-Alam on December 19.

Additional sessions judge V J Kalotara granted bail to Pathan, along with Asif Malik, Mohammed Ibrahim Shaikh, Mohammed Imran Shaikh and Jahir Saiyed, on furnishing personal bonds of Rs 15,000 each. They have been asked to surrender their passports so they cannot leave India without the court’s permission. They have been asked not to tamper with evidence and attend the trial regularly.

Nearly eighty persons including the councillor were arrested by Isanpur police after the violence, on charges of attempt to murder, criminal conspiracy, rioting and unlawful assembly. Nineteen cops were injured when a mob turned violent and attacked a police party that had started detaining people, including Pathan, at the protest site.

Pathan cited parity with his co-accused in this case, who were granted bail by the Gujarat high court on January 30. The co-accused included six women, who spent more than a month behind bars for participating in the protest. They also face charges of attempted murder and rioting.

62,['12/02/2020'],Water level in dams dips as mercury rises,"This story is from February 12, 2020

Madurai: With the afternoons turning scorching in Madurai, water bodies which have been holding water for the past two months have started drying up indicating a looming water crisis. The water level in the two major dams have also started receding.

Mullaperiyar dam level stood at 116.20 feet on Tuesday with no inflow which is almost the same as last year, but there was an inflow last year during the same period. PWD sources say the dam’s water level on the same day last year stood at 116.10 feet, but the evaporation is happening faster now. “If there is no rain in the catchments it will go below the 112 feet mark in the next two weeks,’’ they said.

Similarly, the water level in the Vaigai dam stood at 50.13 feet on Tuesday with nil inflow. Last year too, it had been 50.07 feet, but it has decreased by three feet in less than a week. The water level in the Mullaperiyar dam has gone down from 121.55 feet on January 11 to 116.20 feet on Tuesday, a 5feet decrease, which PWD sources say, is higher than usual. As afternoon temperatures are low in January- February, the water level in the dam goes down by only about two to three feet this season.

Similarly, the water level in the Vaigai dam has decreased by nearly seven feet in the last one month from 57.91 feet on January 11 to 50.80 feet on Tuesday. Last year the decrease in the Mullaperiyar dam level had been by 4 feet during the same period while Vaigai dam’s level had come down by only 1.5 feet. Vaigai dam level had been 57.91 feet on January 11, 2019 and 56.14 feet on February 11, 2019. Water was released for irrigation from the dams, but still evaporation is also high, they said.

Water levels in smaller dams such as Manjalaru and Sothuparai which filled up in the rain have also dipped in the past month. The water level of Manjalaru dam in Theni district had been 50.80 feet on January 11 and on Tuesday, it was 44.95 feet with no inflow. Similarly, the Sothuparai dam had a surplus at 125.78 feet on January 11 and on Tuesday it stood at 107.09 feet, a 19feet decrease in a month. There is no rain in the catchments of these dams.

The level of the Vaigai dam is comfortable now according to Madurai corporation’s standards and wards having the corporation’s water supply will not be disturbed as they get water on alternate days. However, the newly added wards have already started facing problems and water lorries have started supplying water. Places like Yagappa Nagar, Melamadai, Tahsildar Nagar have already started experiencing water problems. ``My borewell yielded water till January 20, but now there is no water, and I have started buying it for Rs 500 a tanker to fill my overhead tank,’’ said Kumaran of Tahsildar Nagar. Many of the streets here are not connected with street taps.

Secretary of Sellur Tank Users association R Abu Bucker said the Sellur tank was holding water after the kudimaramathu works taken up last year. ``But now it has started drying up and we should pray for early rain for the tanks to be sustained,’’ he said. Many tanks which held water are showing signs of drying in the district, something seen in the peak summer season.

PATNA: Taking lessons from the mismanagement of Muzaffarpur and other shelter homes by NGOs, the state social welfare department is to develop 12 child care institutions through its own resources in different districts.Detailed project reports (DPR) have been finalized for the child care institutes to be set up in Patna, Kaimur , Siwan, Aurangabad , Katihar, Nawada, West Champaran, Jamui, Darbhanga, Supaul and Bhagalpur districts by March 2021. The institutes would provide shelter to kids, who are at the risk of or have been subjected to violence.Officials of social welfare department said the institutes would be developed at the total estimated cost of Rs360 crore.Director of social welfare directorate, Raj Kumar, said construction work is likely to begin by next month and the institutes will be ready within one year. “Each institute would have the capacity to accommodate 200 kids, including 100 girls. As per the DPR, the girls and boys will have separate dorms in separate buildings and playgrounds separated by boundary wall,” he told this newspaper on Tuesday.“The institutes will have closed-circuit television cameras with all the facilities for children. Besides, incharge, wardens, cooks and washers, we would also depute security forces at all the institutes,” he said.Kumar said there would be a common facility centre known as ‘Admin Centre’. The centre will have guardrooms on the ground floor and a library, gym, sick room, computer lab and multipurpose hall on first floor. There will be skill development classroom, yoga hall and other activity rooms on the second floor. The institutions will have ramp for children with disabilities.“The community housing buildings for girls and boys and common facility centre will be G+2 structure. The base of these buildings will be developed in such a way that in future, we can create more floors horizontally to accommodate more kids,” Kumar said.He also said all the shelter homes in state would be shut down once the buildings come up and all the inmates will be shifted to new buildings. The district administrations have already identified land for the institutes and are in the process of transferring the land.The building construction department (BCD) has been looking after the bidding process of the proposed institutions. A BCD executive engineer said, “The institute will be laced with rainwater harvesting system, solar panels on rooftop and sewage treatment plant.”",patna,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74093296,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-113181,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/govt-to-set-up-12-child-care-institutions-by-march-2021/articleshow/74087949.cms
64,['12/02/2020'],This Khagaria college lacks facilities even after 39 years,"This story is from February 12, 2020

KHAGARIA: Students and locals rue the lack of basic infrastructure and facilites in KDS College at Gogri, even after 39 years of being a constituent unit. Now a constituent unit of newly created Munger University, the college was under Tilka Manjhi Bhagalpur University (TMBU). It is the only centre of higher education at the sub-divisional headquarters in Khagaria district.

KDS college was established in 1961 and continued to function as an affiliated unit of TMBU till 1981, when it was elevated as a constituent unit of the Bhagalpur-based university. Later, it became a constituent unit of Munger University, which was carved out of TMBU in 2018.

However, students claim that acute shortage of teachers, lack of laboratories and equipment, common rooms for boys and girls, hostel, sports and other recreational facilities continue to affect their studies and other activities.

According to college sources, classes from Intermediate to undergraduate level are being managed by only seven teachers against the sanctioned strength of 20. Hindi, Physics, Chemistry, Mathematics, History, Political Science and Economics departments are being managed by only one teacher, while there is no teacher in Philosophy, Botany, Zoology and Urdu departments. There is no teaching facility for commerce as well.

“The college students have no option,” said Priyanka Kumari , a student.

Sunny, an ABVP office-bearer, also lamented that no steps have taken so far either by the college or university authorities to improve basic infrastructure as well as availability of faculty members.

The fate of a double-storey girls’ hostel to be constructed with a cost of Rs51 lakh and funded by the University Grants Commission (UGC) is also hanging in the balance. The foundation stone of the hostel was laid by former TMBU vice-chancellor Prema Jha on August 14, 2009.

Former CPI MLA Satya Narain Singh has urged the university authorities for early completion of the hostel building in the interest of girl students coming from remote areas of the district.

Acting principal Diwakar Paswan said he was in touch with the university administration for early completion of the girls’ hostel and all-round development of the institution.

Meanwhile, the college is yet to be assessed by National Assessment and Accreditation Council (NAAC). The college may be deprived of UGC grants if it failed to be accredited by the NAAC, sources said.

PATNA: After 72-hours of tireless work by group D employees of Patna Municipal Corporation (PMC), residents of most areas in the state capital claimed on Tuesday that rotting garbage from their neighbourhood has been removed.

According to PMC officials, sanitation workers were engaged round-the-clock in three shifts after they called off their indefinite strike on Saturday evening. The e-cart and auto-tippers are now reaching interior localities as well to collect garbage from households.

“The workers assured me that now they will regularly collect the garbage from homes. They also removed the littered garbage from several places, sprinkled bleaching powder and sprayed anti-mosquito fumigation,” said Muni Devi , a resident of Naya Tola said, adding, e-carts started garbage collection after eight days.

Saurav Jaiswal, a businessman in Patna City, heaved a sigh of relief when sanitation workers removed the garbage and slush near the Malsalami area. “The condition turned worst after multiple broken pipes stared leaking and caused waterlogging at Malsalami area. But they fixed the pipes and sprinkled bleaching powder,” Jaiswal said.

Patna Mayor Sita Sahu said, “From February 12, sanitation workers will work as per their scheduled time as the sanitation condition of city has improved in the past two days.”

The executive officer of Kankerbagh and New Capital circles, Shailesh Kumar , told this newspaper that PMC has covered 90% areas in both the circles, the remaining interior localities would be covered by Wednesday night. “We are also removing garbage from the secondary point at Bakri Bazaar near Patna Junction,” he said.

He added, “The workers will cart away the dumped garbage from the secondary point by Tuesday night and dump the collected garbage at the landfill site.”

Executive officers and sanitary inspectors of the civic body have pressed in all 375 auto-tippers, 182 e-carts, JCB machines, automatic sweeping machines, hand-held fogging machines and vehicle mounted fogging machines to make the city clean.

BAREILLY: Lakhimpur Kheri police has rescued three Red Sandboa snakes , valued at Rs 2 crore in the international market, and arrested three people, including a woman, while they were trying to smuggle the snakes to suppliers. The snakes were rescued from a house at Nanhupurva village in Dhaurahra area of the district on Tuesday.

The non-venomous Red sandboa is popularly known as a two-headed snake, which is the reason for several superstitions associated with it. There is a myth that this species of snake secretes an anti-aging agent in its gland. It is also used for making several medicines. This has resulted in rampant smuggling of this species of snake in Lakhimpur Kheri district.

The trio arrested were identified as Kiran Devi , Mihilal Pasi and Jagatpal . Another member of the gang, Jagdish Kori, is absconding. An FIR under provisions of the Wildlife Protection Act has been registered against all them. Police and forest department are trying to identify the kingpin of this gang.

Hari Om Srivastava, SHO of Dhaurahra police station, said, “A joint operation conducted with the forest department. The snakes were captured from Dudhwa forests. The value of these snakes is nearly Rs 2 crore in the international market,”

67,['12/02/2020'],Fishermen for a better safety net,"This story is from February 12, 2020

For a long time, the fishing community in Tamil Nadu has nursed the grouse that apart from news of a mid-sea attack or a cyclone governments have hardly spared a thought about it. But this year’s budget could be a turning point, with bureaucrats hinting at a thrust on tech support, financial assistance and infra development for marine as well as inland fishery.

Given the political scenario, where the AIADMK government has been on a project announcement spree, fisherfolk hope the upcoming Budget will have some surprises. The government is expected to give a major push by equipping 5,000-odd mechanised boats with transponders in the coming year. Developed by Isro as a means of tracking and communication system for deep sea fishermen, the transponders were fitted in 500 vessels on a pilot basis. ""The Centre has sanctioned the proposal to expand it to all mechanised boats in TN,"" said G S Sameeran, director of fisheries.

Recalling the devastation by Cyclone Ockhi, Justin Antony, president of International Fishermen Development Trust, said there was a need to upgrade warning systems and improve rescue apparatus. ""National Disaster Management Centre and Branch of National Meteorological Centre should be set up at Kanyakumari. Helicopters and speed boats for rescue operations should be provided in coastal districts,"" he said.

The needs of the fishermen, however, are not restricted to safety and technology , but range from financial assistance to welfare schemes for better livelihood. Rather than big-ticket projects, the demand is for additional subsidies that could make daily catch more lucrative. For instance, waiver of value added tax for diesel, brings down cost of diesel by about `30 per litre. ""The government should remove VAT for diesel that cuts down overall operational cost,"" said N J Bose, secretary of Tamil Nadu Mechanised Boat Fishermen Welfare Association.

S Xavier Vas, president of Tuticorin Mechanised Boat Owners Association, says the state should fix a minimum sale price for fish to put an to end traders’ syndicate that fixes low prices. He also pointed out a mechanised boat requires `1.7 lakh a day to sail. ""A boat might take nearly nine days to return. We borrow money for a steep interest of up to `3 lakh. After repayment we are left with a pittance. The government should provide short terms loans at low interest,"" he said.

There is also a need for increasing subsidy for deep sea fishing boats, say fishermen. Bose said despite the present subsidy of `56 lakh for a craft, fishermen have to bear `24 lakh. ""We also have to spend around `50 lakh on fishing gear. That makes it unaffordable for most,"" he said.

68,['12/02/2020'],Patna News: Trucks continue to clog roads in western Patna,"This story is from February 12, 2020

A long queue of trucks on the Digha-AIIMS Road in Patna on Tuesday

PATNA: Factors like poor condition of roads, improper signage and insufficient time allotted to trucks to pass through the J P Setu have resulted in frequent traffic congestion at different locations in the city. The situation is deplorable in areas such as New Bypass Road, Digha-Danapur Canal Road, Phulwarisharif and Naubatpur .

Traffic superintendent (SP) D Amarkesh told this newspaper on Monday that trucks were allowed to pass through the J P Setu only from 10pm to 5am.

“During this seven-hour period, a lot of time is consumed in checking the trucks. Many a time, some of them also break down on the bridge and require at least an hour to be towed away. However, there is no towing vehicle available for trucks coming from Saran-end,” Amarkesh said.

He added, “Due to the lack of time, trucks coming from Rani Talab in Patna take almost three days to reach the J P Setu. At times, the drivers take five to six days to pass through the stretch and reach the bridge. As a result, they try to overtake, making it difficult for the vehicles coming from the opposite direction to move on the road.”

Trucks from Naubatpur, on the other hand, are only allowed to move on the J P Setu from 10pm to 2pm. “Apprehending a traffic snarl, most truck drivers try to overtake other vehicles. Besides, passing through the turning point at Govindpur that goes towards Saran as well as Sonepur is very time-taking,” Amarkesh said.

Attributing huge potholes as one of the major reasons for traffic congestion, he said, “Trucks get trapped due to the big potholes on Beur Mor and lead to traffic snarls near New Bypass Road and Anisabad. Similar is the condition of Shahid Chowk where construction companies have damaged the roads, making huge potholes.”

Meanwhile, queues of trucks parked on the Digha-Danapur Canal Road, Naubatpur and Phulwarisharif have added to the woes of residents and commuters. Vehicular movement on the stretch gets affected due to long queues of trucks parked on the road.

“Traffic jams have become so problematic that it is difficult for me to reach office and return home on time. Trucks remain parked on the Danapur-Digha Canal Road throughout the day,” said Sanjay Prasad, a resident of Mustafapur .

Chanakya Puri resident Aryan Raj rued, “I got stuck on the Danapur-Digha Canal Road for more than an hour on Monday morning because of a long queue of trucks parked there. Besides, the trucks coming from the J P Setu-side made it difficult for me to pass through the stretch.”

Patna district magistrate Kumar Ravi had issued a directive last week to prevent parking of trucks on the Digha-Danapur Canal Road.

69,['12/02/2020'],J&amp;K trip: A lesson in selflessness,"This story is from February 12, 2020

In search of tranquillity, I planned a trip to Jammu and Kashmir. Because I wanted to explore the local culture and have a peaceful stay, I chose a small, humble property, a little far away from the busy centre of Pahalgam. The homestay was managed by an old Kashmiri man who helped me with the booking while also suggesting some local tourist attractions. Three rooms in the property were occupied while the fourth room was locked. It caught my attention.

Later in the day, I explored the enchanting beauty of Pahalgam and gathered a lifetime of experiences.

When I returned to my homestay, I saw the locked room was open and the old man (running the property) was feeding an old lady. It was a heartening sight. I got to know that the lady was paralysed below the waist for 15 years - since the day she and her only daughter fell victim to militancy in the Valley. The couple lost their child in the incident. Since then, her husband served her. He cooked, fed and dressed her while also managing the homestay.

Narrating the tale to me, the old man said that he, somewhere, felt responsible for everything, as he had sent his wife and daughter to Srinagar for legal work that fateful day. His neighbours, of course, couldn’t stop praising him.

His wife, perhaps, saw her daughter in me. Though I couldn’t fathom what she was trying to tell me, I understood her emotions perfectly, through the language of the heart. Today, they are like my second parents.

Their love, care, compassion and hospitality made me understand what selflessness is. No expectations, no favours, no hatred, just selfless giving and love is what I learnt from the Valley, which, people say, is full of fury. I make a point to visit them every year. This incident changed my vision and approach towards life and transformed me into a better, affectionate and selfless human. Let us all rise above the differences of class, beliefs, religion and be empathetic. Let’s not spread hate.

70,['12/02/2020'],Deep Kalra is MakeMyTrip chairman,"This story is from February 12, 2020

Bengaluru: Online travel operating major MakeMyTrip Group announced on Tuesday evening that its co-founder Deep Kalra is moving to a new role. He will become executive chairman of the group, while Rajesh Magow , co-founder and India CEO, will take over the role of group CEO.

Announcing the leadership change, the company said it believes that separating the roles of group CEO and the executive chairman will allow the firm to strengthen its focus on long-term strategic opportunities within and outside India. MakeMyTrip Group also houses platforms like redBus.

In his new role, Kalra, who started MakeMyTrip in 2000, will devote his full time focusing on long-term strategic initiatives, including product innovation and expansion, geographic growth, business model innovation, and corporate development. Kalra led the mega acquisition of then Naspers-backed Goibibo in 2016 to create one of the largest entities in the space through what was an almost $2-billion merger in size. The changes in Kalra and Magow’s roles were approved by the board when it announced its third-quarter earnings. “Over the last six years, Rajesh has been credited with navigating our India business through varied competitive dynamics and championing the growth of our diversified revenue streams. He has successfully integrated the Ibibo group and helped to capitalise on significant synergies across the brands and teams,” Kalra said in the earnings call announcing the move. During the quarter ending December 31, MakeMyTrip said its loss was at $29.5 million as compared to a loss of $29.3 million during the same period in the previous year. Its revenue grew to almost $147 million, compared to almost $125 million in the year-ago period, growing by over 17%. The Gurgaon-based company was able to cut down its expenses for marketing and sales promotion by 9.5% to $45 million in the quarter under review as against $49.7 million in the previous year.

Last year, Naspers sold its stake in MakeMyTrip to China’s travel major Ctrip, which now holds about 49% in the firm compared to 10% it held when it first invested in MakeMytrip in 2016.

During the call, Kalra mentioned they are seeing the impact of novel Coronavirus in outbound business only, across flight and hotel bookings, and that domestic business remains insulated from it. “Cancellation rate is high and the booking rate has also come down. China, Hong Kong and Macau are the most impacted, but even other markets like Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam have seen some impact,” he added.

Non-stop power supply claims trip

I reside in Marredpally’s Ashwini Colony. Residents of lane no. 2 in the colony face frequent voltage fluctuations. We are finding it difficult to run electronic appliances such as television, fridge, air-conditioners. Since supply is insufficient, most equipment either break down or don’t work. The worst part is no stabiliser can handle such fluctuations. Also, the streetlights outside my house have been off for the last two nights. If this is the situation now, I wonder what would happen after the onset of summer? Having said that, I also thank the authorities for solving the sewage problem in the locality. It has been addressed for the time being.

72,['12/02/2020'],Parties hail punishment in Muzaffarpur home case,"This story is from February 12, 2020

PATNA: The pronouncement of prison sentence to 19 convicts in the infamous Muzaffarpur shelter home case by a Saket court of Delhi has been hailed by leaders of ruling as well as opposition parties.

Leader of opposition in state assembly, Tejashwi Prasad Yadav, hailed the court’s punishment order but did not refrain from attacking the state government. “We welcome the court’s order. RJD fought for quite long for getting the culprits in this heinous crime punished. However, there are still some people who are being protected by the state government. Chief minister was initially not ready for CBI inquiry, but we kept demanding the same and it was agreed under the supervision of the Supreme Court. Ruling parties used to initially accuse us that we are spreading rumours … Supreme Court lashed out at the state government at every hearing in the case,” Tejashwi said.

JD(U) functionary and information and public relations department minister Neeraj Kumar claimed that the Nitish Kumar government took up the case with all seriousness and ensured that culprits get stern punishment. “Our government got the social audit conducted in all shelter homes in the state by Tata Institute of Social Sciences (TISS). Later, an FIR was lodged when irregularities and crimes were reported in Muzaffarpur shelter home. It was our government which recommended a CBI inquiry in the case and now the culprits have been punished. We welcome the court’s verdict,” Neeraj said.

He added that Tejashwi has no moral right to question the state government’s intention when his party gave ticket to the wife of a former MLA, who is accused in sexual assault case. “One of the personal secretaries of Tejashwi is accused of sex trafficking,” Neeraj alleged.

Meanwhile, Congress’s Bihar unit working president Kaukab Quadri welcomed the court’s order and said it is a strong warning for people indulged in such heinous crimes.

“It is also a good move that the state government has now decided to run shelter homes on its own,” he said.

73,['12/02/2020'],Tax provisions keep IDBI in red for 13th quarter in a row,"This story is from February 12, 2020

(File photo)

MUMBAI: IDBI Bank on Tuesday reported its 13th successive quarterly loss of Rs 5,805 crore for October-December 2019, as against Rs 4,185 crore in the year-ago period. The loss was on account of a one-time hit of Rs 5,763 crore the bank took by writing down the value of its deferred tax assets as it switched to a lower tax regime.

Had it not been for the provision on tax assets, the results would have swung to a profit of Rs 418 crore, the lender said. The profit before tax for the quarter stood at Rs 756 crore as against a loss of Rs 5,805 crore in Q3 financial year (FY) 2018. This is the first time after 12 quarters the bank is reporting a profit before tax.

The bank’s domestic outstanding deposits shrunk 5% to Rs 2.18 lakh crore at the end of the quarter from Rs 2.29 lakh crore in December 2018. The loan book also declined 15% to Rs 1.29 lakh crore from Rs 1.52 lakh crore a year ago.

The bank said it has not been able to advance loans to businesses because of the lending restrictions under RBI’s prompt corrective action (PCA) framework. The bank’s managing director & CEO M K Sharma said he expected the lender to come out of RBI’s lending restrictions by the end of March 2020.

He said the bank was not growing its deposit rates because of limited lending opportunities given RBI’s curbs. Sharma said the bank will sell its stake in its insurance joint venture IDBI Federal Bank by the first or second quarter of the next year. “We have received binding bids for our 48% stake and we plan to sell all of it in one go,” said Sharma.

He said that during the quarter the bank made recoveries of Rs 3,100 crore, of which Essar Steel’s purchase by ArcelorMittal brought in Rs 2,250 crore. “We have made use of the recoveries to make accelerated provisions of Rs 1,679 crore,” said Sharma. The bank also saw slippages of Rs 2,113 crore during the quarter on account of DHFL and Jain Irrigation, which slipped into the NPA category.

PATNA: The Pratah Kamal Lane , off the busy Sahu Road in Muzaffarpur town, wore a deserted look on Tuesday soon after the Saket court in New Delhi sentenced Brajesh Thakur to imprisonment till his last breath in the case related to sexual and physical assault on several girl inmates of a government-funded shelter home.

Till May 2018, the road used to hum with activities. Politicians, bureaucrats, journalists and who’s who of the state frequently visited the palatial residence of Brajesh, a journalist-cum-politician. Neighbours were envious of him for being close to the powers that be. About two years and nine months later, the scene has completely changed.

Brajesh’s family has shifted elsewhere and the house is locked from outside. “Puri virani chhayi hui hai. Koi us road ki taraf jhakta bhi nahi hai. Charon taraf khamoshi hai (The road is literary deserted. Nobody takes a peep into the house or even the road. An eerie silence prevails everywhere,” said Sayeeda Khatoon (65), whose house is located at a stone’s throw distance from that of Brajesh.

Khatoon said as long as Brajesh’s father Radha Mohan Thakur, a teacher, was alive, they had an association with the family. Radha Mohan, who started a vernacular daily—Pratah Kamal—which later became a landmark in the locality, also used to run an NGO but with a different name. “The young boy (read Brajesh), who started his career as a photo journalist in his father’s newspaper, is now a convict,” she rued.

Khatoon’s neighbour Rubiya (45), is rather elated over the court’s verdict. “Use to saja milni hin thi. Jo karam kiya uski saja mili hai (His rightly deserved this punishment. He has been penalized for the offence he committed),” she said, adding that the Almighty is great and takes care of everybody.

Sayeeda and Rubiya are not alone to hail the verdict of the court. Arvind Kumar Mukhul, district president of the Congress, said, “I honour the order of the Saket court for delivering justice to the victims. But at the same time, I demand from the central government as well as the CBI to disclose the names of the politicians and bureaucrats who frequented Brajesh’s house and also the shelter home.”

Some people, who were known to Brajesh’s family, however, refused to comment. “Why should I give any reaction ? Though I know him and his family for long, I have never been associated with his misdeeds,” said a 55-year-old man, whose house is next to Brajesh’s house on the Pratah Kamal Lane.

Brajesh, the owner of an NGO—Balika Grih—for destitute girls, was arrested on June 2, 2018 along with others after an FIR was lodged with the women’s police station in Muzaffarpur on May 30. The case was handed over to the CBI after much hullabaloo by opposition party leaders over the issue. On January 20, 19 persons, including Brajesh, were held guilty by the court.

75,['12/02/2020'],State yet to send details to Centre forAyushman Bharat funds this fiscal,"This story is from February 12, 2020

PATNA: The state has not received any funds under Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana , popularly known as Ayushman Bharat scheme, from the Centre in this financial year.

Poor performance of Bihar has reportedly been cited as the reason for not granting any funds to the state. State health department principal health secretary Sanjay Kumar admitted that Bihar could not perform well in this sector. He, however added, “But we have spent around Rs100 crore till now. Also, we got extra grant for Ayushman Bharat earlier and have leftover money to be used.”

The Centre released Rs1,699 crore this financial year for Ayushman Bharat scheme in states. However, Bihar did not get a single penny.

After the launch of scheme in September 2018, Bihar got Rs88.27 crore as Centre’s share and Rs50.56 crore as its own share. However, it spent total Rs98.69 crore till January 31 this year. Also, of total 1.08 crore beneficiary families with an average of five members each in Bihar, golden cards have been issued to just 43.10 lakh people. Golden card is like a health insurance card and by using it a family can get a health cover of Rs5 lakh per annum.

A senior health department official also cited delay in sending the details of matching funds to the Centre as another reason for not receiving funds. “Schemes like Ayushman Bharat have matching funds in which Centre and state share certain ratio of expenditure. In such case, the state has to first release its fund so that Centre could match the ratio and then send. The department has sent the file to the state cabinet for its funds approval after which the Centre will be informed about it,” he said.

Sources said funds from the Centre is stopped mainly in two cases — when the state is unable to spend 75% of the money or when the state does not send the details of matching funds to the Centre.

Leader of opposition in the state assembly, Tejashwi Prasad Yadav , on Tuesday took a jibe at chief minister Nitish Kumar and tweeted, “Respected Nitish Kumar ji is more worried about his ‘Ayushman chair’, than ‘Ayushman Bihar’. The state is lagging behind in health parameters. Central government had not given a penny for Ayushman Bharat scheme because it knows that the health system of Bihar is in ICU (sic).” He also attacked state health minister Mangal Pandey for failing to implement health schemes in spite of being in the government for 15 years.

76,['12/02/2020'],LIC News: Government may have to infuse capital into LIC before IPO,"(File photo)

MUMBAI: Besides amending the Life Insurance Corporation ( LIC ) Act, the government will need to infuse capital into the PSU giant ahead of its initial public offering ( IPO ). This is because the corporation’s paid-up capital is only Rs 100 crore, which is not enough for a public flotation.The most conservative estimate values LIC at around Rs 10 lakh crore. If the valuation is close to that of another public sector life insurer SBI Life, it would be around Rs 18 lakh crore. Even if the shares were split to be worth Re 1 each, it would be valued at Rs 10,000 in the market. To create the required liquidity in the corporation’s stock, the government will have to expand the capital base to around Rs 10,000 crore, insurers say.The Union Budget has, however, not made any provision for capitalising LIC. Although it has made a provision of Rs 6,950-crore capital infusion for three public sector non-life insurance companies — National Insurance, Oriental Insurance and United India Insurance.For regular companies, there is always an option to capitalise reserves. But, in the case of LIC, its surplus is distributed to policyholders and the government in the ratio of 95:5. LIC does have large reserves to meet solvency margin requirements. However, actuaries say that Irdai regulations do not permit the use of reserves meant to maintain solvency margin towards capitalisation.“One option would be for the government to forego the dividends being paid out by LIC and let the corporation plough it back as capital. But even under this route, it will take years for the corporation to achieve the desired level of capitalisation,” said an industry source.Last week, LIC chairman M R Kumar had said that the LIC Act would need to be amended before an IPO. The changes to the act would include increasing paid-up capital of the corporation and removal of the requirement that the government owns 100% stake. The corporation, on its part, would have to undertake a valuation exercise including finding its embedded value, which reflects the future profits likely to be earned from policies that have been issued.According to Macquarie Capital Securities research analyst Suresh Ganapathy, the government has budgeted close to Rs 1 lakh crore of proceeds from an LIC IPO . “It is impossible to value now because LIC doesn’t disclose embedded value, return on embedded value, new business margin, plus all those gains sitting on its books… How much of it is in shareholder’s account? So, it’s a big black box now.”According to Ganapathy, a basic way of looking at the valuation would be as a percentage of assets under management (AUM). “The cheapest today is ICICI Prudential Life at 40% of AUM. Being a public sector undertaking, you put a discount for LIC and see. Say, if you put 35%, then its Rs 10.8 lakh crore,” he said. Even at this valuation, LIC is the country’s most valued company and a sub 10% stake sale (as talked about by the government) can fetch that much divestment amount as budgeted.",business,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74092981,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-205201,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/govt-may-have-to-infuse-capital-into-lic-before-ipo/articleshow/74090156.cms

Posters of different students’ bodies line the path leading to JU’s Gate 4

KOLKATA: This will be the first time that ABVP will field its candidate for Jadavpur University ’s students’ union elections slated for February 19. The RSS-affiliated students’ body has, however, decided not to raise the new citizenship law during the campaign, as the candidates fear it might go against them, given the anti-CAA protests on the campus. Instead, it will raise issues concerning the campus and the students.

The university—where politics has been tilted towards the Left—and its students have often been tagged “anti-national” by BJP and RSS leaders, one of whom had even prescribed a “Balakot-like surgical strike” to rid the campus of “such elements”.

“We have fielded nine candidates, five in the engineering department and four in the humanities section. This is the first time that ABVP has put up candidates for JU polls. We feel students want an option better than their current outfit, someone who will raise their issues with the authorities,” said Subhadeep Karmakar, who will contest for the central panel in the Arts Faculty Student Union.

Among the ABVP’s campaign issues are a more efficient placement cell, restriction on outsiders and declaring JU an Institute of Eminence. The university lost out on the Institute of Eminence tag last year. “JU is one of the best universities in the country and we want its infrastructure to be the best. We do not have well-equipped labs or lab assistants. The placement cell is not as efficient as it should be. Entry of outsiders in the campus should also be filtered,” said Karmakar. At least one ABVP candidate said they would not raise the CAA and NRC. “The university has seen several protests against CAA and NRC. We will stick to subjects concerning students,” said the candidate contesting from the Arts department.

A file photo of NSG commandoes carrying out a drill

KOLKATA: The “men in black” are set to pay a visit to the East-West Metro , soon after its first phase is commissioned on Thursday.

A ministry of home affairs official said Black Cat commandos of National Security Guard ( NSG ) are likely to conduct a drill along the five-km stretch between Salt Lake Sector-V and Salt Lake stadium in March. Further drills will be held as the corridor advances towards Howrah Maidan.

NSG, which is in charge of several states in the east and Northeast, has a hub in Kolkata. A part of the training of the elite NSG commandos is to conduct drills to familiarize themselves with vital assets that may be targeted in terror strikes. Such drills are usually carried out in conjunction with the police, who are the first responders in such attacks. Over the years, drills have been held at nearly all important locations in Kolkata, including the existing Metro network.

“People are not aware of such drills as they take place at night. They are conducted at places, like hotels, malls, offices, factories, railway stations, airports, schools and colleges, that normally have a large attendance and are on the radar of terrorists. Drills are held routinely to keep the commandos abreast of the layout of a particular building. In Kolkata, the NSG has also conducted drills using Indian Air Force (IAF) helicopters. During such drills, the Black Cats have slithered down from helicopters in the dark,” the home ministry official said.

A real life scenario is created during such drills and all resources are mobilized. Even hospitals are kept on alert to receive injured people. Through such exercises, both the NSG and the anti-terror squads of the local police develop standard operating procedures that come in handy in real operations. This coordination is crucial to save lives and was realized during the Mumbai terror strikes. “The global security scene keeps on changing. As terrorists upgrade their skills and techniques, agencies, like the NSG, have to outdo them by staying a step ahead. That can only happen through such drills,” the official added.

80,['12/02/2020'],Agencies for financial bid to be shortlisted today,"This story is from February 12, 2020

Aurangabad: Maharashtra Jeevan Pradhikaran (MJP), Mumbai, will be taking a decision on the agencies that can make a financial bid for Aurangabad city’s water supply project on Wednesday.

The four agencies that have made bids for completing the Rs 1,680-crore water supply project are being scrutinised by the MJP.

In the first phase of the project, the MJP had invited bids from agencies to lay a pipeline from Jayakwadi dam to Nakshatrawadi with Rs 1,308 crore in 2019. The tender was closed on February 4 and the MJP received four bids.

The Aurangabad office of the MJP sent the technical bids filed by the agencies to its head office in Mumbai on Tuesday.

MJP executive engineer Prashant Bhamere said that a committee of technical experts scrutinised the agencies in the last four days.

“The scrutiny included verifying whether the agencies meet the parameters listed in the tender document, financial capacity, experience of work, whether they have deposited earnest money and balance sheet.”

Bhamere said that a minimum of three agencies will have to qualify.

Once the agencies are qualified, the financial bid will be opened for the project. In the financial bid, based on the bidding price, the lowest bidder will be selected and then the decision to finalise the agency will be taken.

Meanwhile, the MJP published a tender on February 5 for work worth Rs 34 lakh for dismantling the existing elevated storage reservoir (ESR) and construction of new ESR with capacity of 2,50,000 litres and 12 metre staging, distribution system in Aurangabad. The last date for submission and opening of the tender is February 29.

Incidentally, the crucial scheme, approved by previous state government, was put on hold by the Uddhav Thackeray government. This had stalled the tender process.

The BJP had lodged a strong protest against the government for staying the scheme.

During his visit to the city on January 9, CM Thackeray asked the MJP and the urban development department to expedite the process.

On his visit to the city on January 30, Aurangabad district guardian minister Subhash Desai stated that the work on the project would start before the end of February. Subsequently, the stay was lifted and the tendering process gathered momentum.

Vijayawada: A Chetan Sai Krishna, son of former intelligence chief AB Venkateswara Rao, on Tuesday issued a statement refuting allegations of “misconduct” and “misuse of position” against his father. He also said he never bid or invested in any government projects, as is being alleged.

In his statement, Sai Krishna said he quit his job in the US to launch a start-up in Vijayawada on April 17, 2017. He added that he invested in many other start-up ideas but never sought to venture into any government project, let alone misuse his father’s position. “I faced a lot of failures during my journey but I never used my father’s position to get a government project,” Sai Krishna’s statement read.

He also demanded the ‘baseless’ allegations against him and his father to stop immediately, adding that he would be forced to file a defamation suit against the government if the tirade continues.

Venkateswara Rao, too, reacted to the allegations and said that he would take the legal route to fight against the accusations. TDP chief N Chandrababu Naidu too criticised the move to suspend the officer for “merely working under me” when the TDP government was in power in the state.

Rao, a DG-rank officer, was placed under suspension on Saturday night by the state government or allegedly “endangering” national security through his “acts of treason” when he was the state intelligence chief during the previous TDP regime. The decision was conveyed through a government order issued by chief secretary Nilam Sawhney, based on a confidential report submitted by state DGP Gautam Sawang which alleged “serious misconduct” by the officer in the process of procurement of security equipment.

As per the report, Sai Krishna’s company Akasam Advanced Systems Pvt Ltd were the primary bidders on behalf of RT Inflatables Pvt Ltd, an Israeli defence company. The anti-corruption bureau (ACB) has been asked to probe into the matter.

KOCHI: Railways will be providing rent-a-car facilities at Ernakulam Junction and Town railway stations as part of a slew of benefits worked out for passengers and to generate non-fare revenue. The project will be operationalized by IndusGo Pvt Ltd from Wednesday. Passengers can book vehicles online by entering details on the website, IndusGo.in or by calling on the number available on the website. They have to deposit a security amount of Rs 5,000, which is refundable, for hiring the vehicle.

The company will park five cars on each of the station premises. The passengers can pay a minimum amount of Rs 500 for five hours or opt for an hourly rate of Rs 50-60. The charges will vary depending on the brand of car.

“After the passenger selects date, time, location and the vehicle, the bill will be generated automatically. The payment should be made online. The cars are all GPS-enabled. The passenger can drive the vehicle to any destination and needs to return it at his/her convenience but he/she will be charged an additional amount,” said a company official.

The passenger must produce original licence and ID proof to the executive posted at the stations. The executive will scan and upload them on the website before handing over the vehicle’s key to the passenger. If the passenger returns the vehicle before the scheduled time, the remaining amount will be refunded to his account.

Railways will get a fixed licence fee from the company for using railway land to park its vehicles.

Railway officials believe existing taxi operators on the station premises are not likely to oppose the initiative. ‘The rent-a-car facility will be used only by those passengers who know driving. Rest of the passengers would prefer hiring taxies with drivers,” said a railway official.

Madhya Pradesh chief minister Kamal Nath being felicitated during the National Water Convention at Minto Hall ... Read More

BHOPAL: Chief minister Kamal Nath warned of a looming water crisis and emphasized the need for its conservation at a national water convention here on Tuesday.

“Sixty-five dams and 165 reservoirs of Madhya Pradesh are affected by drought and the local bodies have been able to supply water to people every 2 to 4 days. This crisis is going to intensify further,” Nath said. “We have to start working on the issue now. People working in the field of water conservation have to play a major role. The next generation will never forgive us if we ignore the issue,” he added.

Madhya Pradesh is working on a new legislation—Right to Water Act- to make 55 litres of water available to people of the state daily. The chief minister asked the gathering to suggest ways to make the proposed law “practical and effective.”

Magsaysay award winner Rajendra Singh, popularly known as the ‘Waterman of India’, has mobilized water conservationists, environmentalists and social workers from across the country holding deliberations on the issue. Appreciating the chief minister, Rajendra Singh who is popularly known as waterman of India, said: “The new initiative of MP to bring a new law on the right to water will force the country to think and work over the issue of water conservation.”

Nath said that the motive behind bringing the water legislation was to create awareness among the people about the conservation of water, and to make people stakeholders in the effort. He said there were many new techniques of water conservation to increase the water-table.

The chief minister recalled that he had raised the issue of water conservation way back in 1992 at the Earth Summit.

Talking about the new legislation, minister for public health engineering Sukhdeo Panse said Madhya Pradesh would be the first state to make such a law. He said that every aspect of water including its recycling, recharging, supply and use will come under its ambit.

“Seventy-two per cent of population of Madhya Pradesh lives in 55,000 villages and 98 % of water consumption in the villages is dependent on underground water. This is the reason why declining water table is creating a crisis every year.”

AGRA: With less than two months remaining for 2019-20 financial year to end, the Agra Municipal Corporation (AMC) administration has swung into action to recover house tax.

The civic body administration has issued legal notices to 550 property owners having over Rs 1 lakh as pending property tax dues. The total amount of pending dues with these property owners is around Rs 8 crore. Civic body administration has asked the defaulters to clear their outstanding dues within seven days or else their property will be seized.

There are around 3.10 lakh properties registered across 100 wards of the city. In the current fiscal, so far, only 50,000 property owners have submitted their house tax totaling Rs 35 crore. This is way short of the annual target of Rs 65 crore.

The AMC revenue officials have shortlisted major defaulters of four zones in the city. In Hariparwat, Lohamandi, Chatta and Tajganj zone, there are a total of 550 of defaulters, each having accumulated over Rs 1 lakh as dues. A majority of these property owners have not paid any tax to the civic body in the last three years.

Municipal commissioner Arun Prakash said, “We are issuing final notices to major property tax defaulters . If they fail to clear the dues in a time-bound manner, then an exercise to seize their property will be initiated.”

To increase revenue recovery and bring transparency in collection of house tax, AMC administration has launched an android based tax collection app.

Last month, revenue inspectors were provided smart handheld devices. Connected to the civic body’s central server, these devices allow revenue inspectors to issue on-the-spot receipt to the property owners. Besides, the central survey will also send a message of receiving payment on the registered mobile number of the client concerned.

According to the municipal commissioner, the new tax collection system will leave no scope for any malpractice in the tax collection process. The 100 android-based handheld devices have been provided to the AMC by Axis Bank as part of the corporate social responsibility.

AGRA: A group of students of Aligarh Muslim University ( AMU ) on Tuesday offered a five-minute silent prayer for a Mumbai lawyer, Shahid Azmi , who was allegedly killed 10 years ago on this day.

According to students, Azmi was killed while fighting for justice. They said by holding the prayer meeting they wanted to convey a message that they too are fighting for justice and are willing to become Shahid Azmi in their own way. Students read Quran Khawani at Bab-e-Syed for people who were injured while protesting against the contentious Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA).

The event was organized by the students’ coordination committee on AMU campus. Scores of students have been protesting against the CAA on university campus since December 16.

Meanwhile, the university authorities said the exams are being held and are expected to be over by next week.

Talking with TOI, spokesperson of the university Shafey Kidwai said new semester classes have also started and the university is almost back to normal. He said there is a possibility of reduction in the number of summer vacation days this year due the disruption of the academic activities on campus.

KOCHI: Ernakulam coastal police have served a notice to the captain and owner of Hansa Prem , a tanker which faces arrest threat, following a high court order, which has asked it not to leave the Kerala coast until further order.

The notice was served by coastal police and the ‘daffedar’ from the HC on Tuesday. Colombo Dockyard PLC , a Sri Lanka-based company had filed a petition alleging that the vessel’s owner failed to pay an amount of Rs 78 lakh to the company for carrying out maintenance work. The petitioner had urged the court to prevent it from leaving the Kerala coast until it deposits the amount in the court. The Cochin Port expressed helplessness in arresting the ship since it has been anchored outside its jurisdiction. Subsequently, the court ordered the coastal police to arrest the ship.

The vessel, registered in Mumbai, reached Kerala to fill oil from BPCL. The ship is anchored at 13.5 nautical miles away from the coast. The state’s jurisdiction falls within 12 nautical miles from the coast. If the ship enters 12 nautical miles, the vessel has to pay rent to the Cochin Shipyard.

To avoid paying rent, the ship has been anchored at the international channel.

Representative image

BENGALURU: Seven years after he was held guilty of murdering his wife over his alleged relationships and sentenced to life term in jail, a Jewargi-based doctor has been acquitted by the high court. The court said the statement of the woman’s relatives and friends were never put to test though they were interested parties and the prosecution too failed to establish his extramarital affairs.

Though circumstantial evidence itself is enough to form the basis for conviction, the circumstances must be conclusive in nature and there shouldn’t be any missing link, a division bench of Justices Sreenivas Harish Kumar and Mohammed Nawaz said, while acquitting Siddaling, now 35 years old.

Siddaling and Manjula married in 2008 and have a son. Manjula was found dead on May 19, 2010 in what was initially described as a road accident. Following a complaint from her sister, police arrested Siddaling and his three associates for allegedly murdering his wife.

The prosecution alleged that Siddaling decided to kill Manjula after she repeatedly quarrelled with him over his alleged relationships with other women. Manjula’s brother and sister and another friend gave evidence that she had spoken to them about her husband’s affairs as well as his ill-treatment.

It was also alleged that Siddaling bought an LIC insurance policy for Rs 2 lakh seven months before her death, with an intention to pay Rs 50,000 each from the amount to the other accused.

The prosecution claimed that on May 19, 2010, Manjula was going with her husband and two other accused in a Tata Indica car along Jewargi-Sindagi road. At 10pm, the vehicle was stopped near Nelogi on the pretext of a tyre puncture and the accused attacked her with iron rods. Thereafter, the fourth accused driving a Cruiser jeep rammed the vehicle into the Indica to make it appear that Manjula died in an accident.

The 1st additional sessions judge, Kalaburagi on February 10, 2012 convicted Siddaling and acquitted the other three accused. Relying on the statements of two relatives and a friend of Manjula, the trial court said there was strong motive for Siddaling to kill his wife and awarded him life imprisonment.

However, the high court felt the evidence placed by the prosecution couldn’t establish beyond reasonable doubt that Siddaling was guilty as there were no independent witnesses to support the charges.

Madurai: A 54-year-old artist from Cuddalore is on a more than 50-day journey across the state to create awareness through his paintings about climate change and environmental conservation among school and college students.

N Tamilarasan from Mannampadi village in Cuddalore district, has undertaken the journey for the 11th time this year. On Tuesday, the artist exhibited his paintings at the St Charles College of Education in Madurai and interacted with the students. “It is like a pilgrimage for me every year. But, I feel that the message needs to be repeated and reinforced to reach the younger generations. Everyone knows about climate change now but still refuse to act. Only when we keep creating awareness, change can happen,” said Tamilarasan.

Around 80 paintings, including water colour, acrylic and sketches were exhibited under the ‘Mother Earth’. “This year, I wanted to focus on protecting and nurturing nature and how otherwise it can destroy lives. With destruction of forests, come destruction of wildlife species which is sometimes neglected,” said Tamilarasan, adding that he gets inspiration for his paintings from travelling across India. Several moving abstract pictures on display were of animal carcasses and bones highlighting themes of death and destruction.

The veteran artist, who has a degree from the Government College of Fine Arts, Chennai, has covered 25 districts so far this year in buses and trains, all expenses borne by him. He began his journey on January 3 at Kallakurichi district and will be ending it on February 28 at his native Cuddalore district. “I try my best to create awareness and educational institutions are always supportive when I request to exhibit the paintings. However, more could be done with better support to reach more children,” added Tamilarasan.

The artist also donates the paintings he exhibits to willing schools and colleges.

92,['12/02/2020'],New drug delivery system to up effect of two key drugs,"This story is from February 12, 2020

Kinjal Parikh

Vadodara: A research scholar has developed a new drug delivery system that can increase the efficiency of two medicines – iloperidone and vardenafil hydrochloride.

Iloperidone is used for treating schizophrenia while vardenafil hydrochloride is a drug used to treat erectile dysfunction.

Kinjal Parikh, as a research scholar from the pharmaceutics department of M S University’s Faculty of Pharmacy, has worked on increasing bioavailability of these two drugs.

Bioavailibility is the proportion of a medicine which enters the blood circulation when introduced into the body to have an active effect.

“Currently, the effectiveness of these two drugs is less. When a patient consumes these drugs, only 15 to 30 % of these drugs reach plasma (blood) of the patient,” said Parikh.

“We have developed oil (lipid-based) drug delivery system that increases the concentration of these drugs by two to three fold in the plasma. As the bioavailability increases, efficiency of these drugs also increases,” said Parikh, who currently works with an Ahmedabad based firm.

Parikh had carried out the PhD research work entitled ‘Development and characterization of lipid-based nano drug delivery systems for some poorly bioavailable drugs’ under the guidance of professor Krutika Sawant, dean of Faculty of Pharmacy.

Currently, these drugs are available in oral tablet format. The drug delivery system was developed at the laboratory of pharmacy faculty.

The research has been published in two international journals - Molecular Liquid and AAPS Pharm Sci Tech.

Her work recently won the best PhD thesis award at the 34th Gujarat Science Congress that was held at Ganpat University on February 8 and February 9.

As appreciation for her work, she has received a medal from the Gujarat Science Academy, sponsored by Changa-based Charotar University of Science and Technology.

Aurangabad: Patients seeking treatment at Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH) will no longer have to burn a hole in their pockets as a generic medicine store on the hospital premises, which was opened on Tuesday as part of the Pradhan Mantri Jan-Aushadhi Yojana, is offering medicines upto 60% lesser than the prices prevalent in the market.

At any given time, the state-run hospital has around 2,000 out-patients and 8,000 indoor patients. As per the state government norms, the hospital has to procure medicines and other supplies from Haffkine Bio-Pharmaceutical Corporation Ltd — the firm chosen by the Centre for procuring medicines. According to sources in the GMCH administration, the hospital perenially suffers from a shortage of medicines as despite placing the order on time, the procurement process takes time.

As a result, patients are left with little choice but to buy the medicines prescribed by the doctors from outside. The patients, who mostly come from the rural areas, are poor and are not able to afford the exorbitant rates charged by the private medicine stores.

Serpentine queues could be seen outside the generic medicine store as soon as it opened on Tuesday. According to Kadu Satdive, an elderly resident from TV Centre, the medicine shop is a boon for poor people.

Jayendra Salve, whose brother is undergoing treatment at GMCH for asthama, said that the medicine which costed Rs 80 in private shops outside cost only Rs 20 at the generic store.

Meanwhile, the GMCH administration is not happy with the opening of the shop. When asked about the store, GMCH’s acting dean Kailash Zine said that the directorate of medical education and research (DMER) had previously cancelled the tender filed by the agency which opened the generic store. “The store was suddenly opened on Tuesday. If DMER sends a letter, then we will take necessary action against the store,” said Zine.

In October last year, DMER had asked all government medical colleges in the state to ensure that generic medical stores be opened in the hospitals so that people can have access to medicines at lesser rates.

Mithun, the prime accused, and Tulsidas were booked under IPC Section 302 for murdering Babloo alias Dharamveer, whose body was recovered on Sunday from a nullah in the industrial area of Shashtripuram.

According to police, Mithun was in love with Babloo’s married daughter Anjali. He had even eloped with her in 2018 while she was living at her parent’s home. Anjali, though, had returned home a few weeks later, after Babloo and Mithun engaged in a scuffle. Babloo had then sent his daughter back to her in-law’s place in Jasrana, where in 2019 she died under suspicious circumstances, following which an FIR was lodged against her husband and in-laws.

“Infuriated at Anjali’s death, Mithun decided to take revenge and stabbed Babloo to death along with Tulsidas, after which they dumped his body in the nullah,” said sub-inspector Kuldeep Malik of Sikandra police station.

97,['12/02/2020'],Crossing road outside GRH a high-risk affair,"This story is from February 12, 2020

Madurai: For years now, patients and pedestrians, including pregnant women and children, have been putting their lives at risk while crossing the road outside the main entrance of Government Rajaji Hospital (GRH) on Panagal Road in Goripalayam.

With the ever-busy Goripalayam Junction just a few hundred metres away, Panagal Road remains one of the busiest in the city with traffic bustling 24x7. The two-way road is split only with barricades for a short distance from Goripalayam Junction and remains open thereafter closer to the GRH main gates. There is also no pedestrian crossing for the entire stretch of the road across the expanse of GRH.

“There is always speeding traffic and many vehicles even overtake and cross over to the other side facing the incoming traffic. It is very difficult to cross the road as there is a chance of being hit by vehicles but we have no choice either,” said Divya G, a GRH patient’s attender. Despite the presence of a subway nearby for crossing, hardly anyone uses it as it is maintained poorly and there are no lifts or escalators as well.

To add to their misery, share auto drivers often park right outside the GRH entrance or just after it causing traffic jams, especially with buses stopping just around 50 metres away at the GRH bus stops. Many of the drivers are aware that parking in the area is prohibited but still indulge in the practice. “We can’t help it if passengers ask us to stop there. Some of them are old or sick and want to get as close as possible. It is only a momentary stopping. We try to quickly get out of the way,” said Vikram R, a driver.

GRH security staff at the hospital gates say that the situation has been the same for years and that even after bringing it to the notice of traffic police no action was taken. “We try to help pedestrians and regulate traffic but most drivers and pedestrians don’t listen. We have to watch out and guide ambulances too. Share auto drivers too never listen despite repeated warnings,” said one of staff member.

Meanwhile, a higher official from Madurai city traffic control said they will be appointing a traffic police constable to regulate traffic and also fine those parking illegally along the stretch outside GRH.

“We have taken note of the situation and have been recommending a pedestrian crossing to be made. We hope it can be done,” said the official.

Berhampur: Different political parties and organisations demanded arrest of the top-level officers of Southco, the power distribution company, in connection with the electrocution of 10 persons after a bus in which they were travelling came in contact with a sagging live wire at Mandarajpur under Ganjam district’s Golanthara police limits on Sunday.

The Congress district unit on Tuesday lodged an FIR with the SP (Berhampur) Pinak Mishra, while the CPM lodged a complaint in Baidyanath Pur police station on Monday evening. Holding the Southco responsible for the major mishap, the local Congress leaders urged police to take action against its officials.

Earlier, several Congress supporters staged demonstration near the SP (Berhampur) office. “Berhampur SP has assured us to take action against the guilty,” said Pramod Kumar Jena, a local Congress leader.

On Monday evening, the CPM’s Ganjam district unit lodged an FIR in Baidyanath Pur police station, seeking arrest of P K Sahoo and P Arun Kumar, authorised officer and chief operating officer (COO) of Southco, respectively, for the mishap.

“The incident took place because of the Southco officers did not fix the sagging live wire. This despite the locals lodging complaints several times,” said CPM’s state secretary Ali Patnaik, who was in the team which lodged the FIR.

“We will register a station diary on their complaint,” said inspector in-charge, Baidyanath Pur police station, S P Das. He said a case regarding the mishap has already been registered at Golanthara police station and investigation is on.

Before lodging the FIR, CPM leaders visited the MKCG Medical College and Hospital here where injured persons are undergoing treatment. At least five injured persons are undergoing treatment at MKCG while seven are being treating at SCB Medical College and Hospital, Cuttack. Their condition is stated to be stable, police said.

CPM state unit demanded Rs 20 lakh compensation to kin of each deceased person and at least Rs 5 lakh to each injured person.

After the accident, the government announced Rs 2 lakh to kin of each deceased and free treatment to the injured persons. Government also suspended four engineers — two each from Southco and rural development department — on Monday for negligence in duty.

CHENNAI: The flyover at Sardar Patel Road-LB Road junction has neither reduced traffic congestion nor prevented accidents. The multi-crore project is an example of poor planning and road engineering.

Data with traffic police show that 40 people died in and around the flyover in 2018. The structure reduced the road width and the number of people taking the narrow adjoining roads was more than people taking the flyover. This leads to traffic congestion throughout the day. “Most vehicles from Thiruvanmiyur that take right at the traffic signal to reach Adyar and Guindy have one lane now instead of two in the past. It’s frustrating to see the road under the flyover clogged when flyover itself remains empty. We would have been better without it,” said S Badrinathan, a resident of Padmanaban Nagar.

This is because flyover was constructed without considering Indian Road Congress (IRC) guidelines. IRC recommends a grade separator only if 10,000 or more passenger cars use it every hour. “Not even half the number used it when the proposal was cleared and projections made for the next 10 years were wrong,” said R Rengachari, a transportation activist.

Aswathy Dilip, senior programme manager from Institute of Transportation and Development Policy said researches show flyovers cannot solve congestion by building flyovers as they only provide short-term illusion of relief. “Cities are tearing down flyovers, creating better streets and public spaces with strengthened public transport,” she said. Many flyovers, subways, traffic signals and zebra crossings across Chennai are poorly designed or remain inaccessible to people.

According to data from union road transport ministry, around 260 people died in 645 accidents reported in Chennai because of bad road infrastructure and design. By road infrastructure, the ministry refers to obstacles such as poles, encroachments, sharp curves, improper alignment and gradient, potholes and animal crossings.

Road users in Chennai said the median design is so bad that cars sometimes can’t see vehicles coming in the opposite direction on arterial roads such as Poonamalle High Road and GST Road. At some points the road dividers are above four metres, which is against IRC guidelines.

P Senthil, a Chennai-based civic activist, said these medians are uninterrupted and don’t have cuts even to enter hospitals. For instance, to enter Kilpauk Medical College from Amjikarai, ambulances have to wait at Barnaby Road junction to take a U-turn. Most vehicles including ambulances drive on the wrong side of the road to reach hospital quickly. “This is another example of bad road design and you can spot such deficiencies at foot over-bridges and subways,” he said.

Kamal Soi from National Road Safety Council also called for rectification of black spots – spots that have been historically accident-prone. “The Chennai corporation and highways department should first take this up in full swing,” he said. Seventeen such accident-prone stretches have been identified but rectification was completed along three stretches.

Aurangabad: Bolstered by the huge victory in the Delhi assembly election on Tuesday, the local unit of the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) has decided to fight the Aurangabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) election on the issues of water supply, health and roads.

Soon after the Delhi results started showing AAP candidates leading in most constituencies, jubilant members gathered at the party’s office at Cidco N-7, raising slogans of ‘Victory in AMC polls now” .

The local unit held a victory rally from Cidco to Chikalthana and then to the railway station.

Subhash Mane, AAP’s city president, said the Delhi model of development will be replicated in Aurangabad and that his party would contest all the 115 seats in the AMC elections.

“Citizens receive water once in six days, the roads are full of potholes. The city, once known as the fastest developing in Asia, has become notorious for its waste crisis,” Mane told TOI.

He said that industries are not willing to come to Aurangabad because of its poor image, but AAP will change that image soon.

Mane said so far, people in Aurangabad did not have an alternative. “Now, AAP has emerged as an alternative that can bring development.”

About the poll preparations in the city, he said citizens have started approaching AAP with their civic problems and the party members are helping them.

Isak Andewala, AAP’s city executive president, said his party has appointed ward presidents, block presidents, assembly constituency presidents and youth wing presidents.

“We will be going to the people with the Delhi model of development, offering regular water supply, tackling waste, improving health and education standards. The response is good,” he said.

Sugriv Munde, AAP district convener, said Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal, his deputy Manisha Sisodia and party spokesperson Sanjay Singh will campaign for the party’s candidates during the forthcoming civic elections.

Gagan Bihari Jena

BERHAMPUR: The driver of the bus, 10 of whose passengers died when the vehicle came in contact with high-voltage sagging wires in Ganjam district on Sunday, was arrested from his home in the district’s Akatala village on Tuesday.

“Gagan Bihari Jena (50), the driver, from Akatala village (Belaguntha area) was arrested from his home for rash and careless driving,” sub-divisional police officer ( Berhampur ) Sadara Jayant Kumar Mohapatra said. “Jena was absconding after the accident occurred. Acting on a tip-off, we raided Jena’s home and arrested him,” he added.

Jena has been booked under Sections 279 (rash driving), 337 (causing hurt by act endangering lives), 304 (A) (causing death by negligence) and 38 (person concerned in criminal act may be guilty of different offences) of the Indian Penal Code and 192 (A) of the Motor Vehicles Act.

At least 10 people died of electrocution and 20 sustained injuries when the private bus came in contact with a low-hanging power transmission line and caught fire near Mandarajpur village under Ganjam district’s Golanthara police station limits. It was carrying around 40 passengers, most of whom were from Dankalpadu village. The incident took place when they were on their way to Chikarada village to attend an engagement ceremony.

Regional transport officer (Ganjam) Sanjay Biswal said, “We have suspended the driver’s driving licence for three months following the recommendation of the joint inspection committee, which is investigating the incident.”

Sources said Ganjam collector Vijay Amruta Kulange has recommended the state transport commissioner to cancel the registration of the bus as it was plying on the Mandarajpur route without seeking permission from the authorities. The bus has a permit to ply from Hinjili to Cuttack via Berhampur.

Transport minister Padmanabh Behera blamed local electricity officials for the tragedy and has asked the Ganjam district administration to launch a probe into the incident. Southco is the power distribution firm that operates in the area.

Madhya Pradesh chief minister Kamal Nath

BHOPAL: AAP's resounding victory in the Delhi election indicates the “start of rejection of BJP in the country”, CM Kamal Nath said on Tuesday.

“Look what’s happening to BJP. It is in power at the Centre but people have started recognizing the true face of BJP. No BJP leader who is part of the Union government speaks on unemployment,” said Nath, who led his Congress to victory in the 2018 assembly polls in MP.

Nath called AAP president Arvind Kejriwal to congratulate him, and, according to sources in state Congress, told him that AAP has “shown the mirror to BJP”.

Asked about Congress’s rout in Delhi, Nath told reporters that the party knew it would lose. “But BJP, which made big claims, has been rejected by the people,” he pointed out. Later, Nath posted a series of tweets to laud Kejriwal and target BJP. “I hope and believe that the newly elected Delhi government under Arvind Kejriwal’s leadership will work for development, progress and public welfare to meet expectations of the people,” said his first tweet.

He followed it up with: “The results may not have been favourable for Congress. We will review it at the party level. But this election result has come as a hard lesson for BJP. After MP, Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh, Maharashtra and Jharkhand, the Delhi result proves that citizens have started rejecting BJP’s politics of spreading hate.”

“BJP deployed its entire force in Delhi polls, tried to mislead and divert attention from real issues, and served false propaganda, all of which failed to succeed. This result is the defeat of anti-people policies of the government at the Centre. It is time for introspection for BJP. It indicates the start of rejection of BJP in the country,” the CM added.

105,['12/02/2020'],Poor revenue an obstacle for rolling out populist schemes,"This story is from February 12, 2020

Chennai: When deputy chief minister O Panneerselvam rises to present the last full Budget of the present AIADMK government on Friday, he will have an uphill task as tax revenue has been declining and the government’s expenditure has been heading north.

Data shows that Tamil Nadu received Rs5,037 crore GST compensation from the Centre till September-end during this fiscal. Unless it gets a similar amount before the end of March, Tamil Nadu will have a tough time managing its finances. States are eligible for GST compensation from the Centre if the annual GST revenue growth is less than 15%.

Sources in the finance department told TOI the government increased liquor price a week ago only to keep the fiscal deficit under 3% of GSDP. The government is expecting about Rs2,500 crore addition to its revenue on account of increase in liquor price.

For the past three years, the government has not been able to meet tax revenue targets. In 2018-19, though the Budget projected a tax revenue of Rs1.12 lakh crore, it could mop up only Rs1.1 lakh crore as per the revised estimate. The final figures have not been released. The tax revenue estimate for the current financial year is Rs1.24 lakh crore and there is little likelihood of meeting the target.

This year, with a general slowdown the economy, the government is not upbeat about meeting the tax revenue target. Having overstretched its resources with announcement of freebies in the previous Budgets, the FM does not have much leeway to dole out more populist schemes in the coming Budget.

Many MLAs and AIADMK functionaries have been pushing for region-specific development projects to woo voters in their respective regions. ""The government cannot meet all the demands. It has to work within the financial leverage it enjoys. Public debt has been mounting and interest outgo has been increasing every year. Overall debt is likely to touch Rs4 lakh crore this year,"" Madras School of Economics director K R Shanmugam told TOI.

The government, meanwhile, is compelled to invest heavily in the energy sector, partly to compensate the losses to Tangedco and partly to upgrade its infrastructure. ""We are expecting some support from the government to lower the losses. Tariff revision is long overdue and, being an election year, we are not sure whether the government would want to do it. Damage to infrastructure owing to natural calamities is another burden Tangedco is bearing. Unless the government steps in to compensate the losses, the discom will face a tough time,"" said a senior TNEB official.

""As things stand today, the Budget will continue to have revenue deficit and the government will find it tough to keep the fiscal deficit within 3% of the GSDP — to comply with the FRBM Act. There are enough and more freebies being given to the masses. The latest addition is Rs1,000 dole per ration card. I don’t see any more freebies coming in the Budget,"" said Shanmugam.

In case the fiscal deficit crosses 3% of GSDP, the Reserve Bank of India will start tightening the purse strings. ""Once the government’s ratings dip, borrowings from financial institutions to balance fiscal deficit will become difficult,"" said Shanmugam.

The 15th Finance Commission, in its report for 2021-22, has said that Tamil Nadu is expected to have a nominal growth rate of 9.9%. ""Generally, the nominal growth rate includes inflation and only after deducting the inflation rate will we know the actual or real growth rate. For Tamil Nadu, the actual growth rate will be less than 5% which is not enough for increasing the revenue,"" said an economist in Madras University.

Vadodara: Traders in the Mangal Bazaar area of the city have objected to the Vadodara Municipal Corporation (VMC) putting up railings in the market. Those having shops in the area held demonstrations forcing VMC to stop work.

VMC had taken up a major drive of clearing encroachments in Mangal Bazaar recently. It decided to put up railing along the divider of the road so that street vendors did not encroach on the road again. The civic body is looking to ensure that traffic flows on the road smoothly.

The shopkeepers, however, objected to the erection of railings stating that these would hamper traffic movement. VMC workers began digging holes in the road for erecting the railings on Tuesday morning. As soon as work began, shopkeepers in the market gathered on the street and held demonstrations.

In wake of the heightened tempers, the civic body has decided to suspend the work for now. The shopkeepers had on Monday evening met standing committee chairman Satish Patel and on Tuesday morning too met VMC officials to take up the issue.

Writhing in pain and bleeding profusely on the pavement, Kumar took photographs of the autorickshaw, fearing its driver might flee.

A few passersby took Kumar to hospital, but by then the auto driver had fled. During investigation police found out that the driver was drunk and was speeding, the vehicle did not have insurance papers and his driving licence had expired.

The incident hit Kumar and his family hard. He underwent a surgery and got plates fixed in his right leg, but doctors have told him that he had damaged nerves in his ankle. Kumar would need another surgery but the family has run out of cash. His wife had already pledged her gold jewellery to pay the hospital expenses.

Bedridden and out of work, Kumar says he is not able to console his four-year-old daughter who keeps asking him for new toys. “I can’t send my wife to work. She is not familiar with the city,” he said.

“Those who violate the law should think that a fault of theirs can cripple someone’s normal life. My family is dependent on me and now we have nowhere to go,” Kumar said.

Ahmedabad: The Gujarat high court on Tuesday completed hearings and reserved its verdict on a PIL challenging the state government’s bid to evict residents of six villages near Kevadia in Narmada district, for tourism development projects around the Statue of Unity (SoU).

The bench headed by Chief Justice Vikram Nath finished hearings the arguments by the government and the petitioner activists. This happened after both parties did not agree to resolving the issue through negotiations as suggested by the high court last month.

Earlier, the state government declined a suggestion by the high court to set up a committee to negotiate the issue with project-affected people.

Earlier, the state government proposed a compensation package for rehabilitation of 312 families in these six villages. The petitioners asked for more in terms of land and financial compensation as well as the place of relocation.

The petitioners’ counter proposal was not accepted by the state government, who kept insisting that these villagers had re-entered the acquired land after having accepted the compensation once.

The petitioners, on the other hand, have been vehemently contesting the government’s claim that possession of the land was ever taken by the government after evicting the villagers.

110,['12/02/2020'],‘Ancient Indian economics has answers to current issues’,"This story is from February 12, 2020

AHMEDABAD: Ancient Indian economics , which is often overlooked by many experts, may hold the answers to many of our current issues.

This was stated by Sanjeev Sanyal, principal economic adviser to the government of India, at his lecture, ‘Rethinking India’s Economy for the 21st Century’, at the GICT Auditorium, Ahmedabad University, on Tuesday

While there are other frames of reference to prepare for the 21st century, we should consider our own history, where India was a dominant economy of the world for more than two-thirds of known human history, he said.

“There are intellectual underpinnings of ancient Indian economics. No one has talked much about it, neither historians nor economists. There are many things to learn from here,” he told the gathering.

Given the importance of India’ ancient history on its culture and civilization, Sanyal cited examples of how India’s ancient trade and commerce flourished across the globe from Oman to Bahrain, Mesopotamia , Rome, Arabia, Persia to China and Korea, among others.

Arguing that ancient India’s rich past was not because of individual successes, Sanyal said it was due to trade carried out by corporate guilds that were much like the multinational companies of today.

“Hundreds of merchants had tripartite agreements with producers, merchants and customers overseas,” according to Sanyal.

Funding for all this did not come from personal finance but from temples that functioned like banks.

“The reason many of these temples had so much gold was not that many kings were handing over their wealth to the temples...they functioned as banks and were venture capitalists for all trade that was going on,” he said adding that Somnath temple in Gujarat had so much wealth because it was a port town in ancient times with the temple right on the beach.

If one were to look carefully at India’s ancient history, there were not one or two individuals but there were different schools of thoughts in economics. While elaborating that there were four broad areas of knowledge that were considered important for governance and economic management, Sanyal said that all different economists agreed on the path laid down for ‘Vaarta’ (wealth and economic policy) and ‘Dandneeti’ (law enforcement for contract).

Ancient India celebrated wealth creation and its redistribution which is seen in the writings of Kautilya (also known as Chanakya) and others.

E-autorickshaws parked at MG Road Metro station for recharging

KOCHI: Ernakulam district autorickshaw driver’s cooperative society (EDADCS) will take the initiative to launch 250 e-autos in the city. The society will join hands with the corporation and private establishments to operate the fleet of e-autorickshaws.

“As the Kochi Metro Rail Ltd (KMRL), which initially took the initiative to launch e-autos in the city, has started giving a cold shoulder to the project, the society is looking at the possibility of other collaborations. The 250 e-autos are expected to join the city’s fleet during February-March,” said M B Syamanda Bhadran, a representative of EDADCS.

He said with the support of the corporation, EDADCS will introduce 50 e-autos, and that they will operate at Fort Kochi , Kadavanthra and Elamkulam stations.

Currently, e-autos introduced with the backing of KMRL mainly operate from MG Road Metro station and Maharaja’s College Metro station. Maharaja’s College station is the only active e-auto stand and has about eight e-autos. Charging facilities are available at MG Road Metro station.

The e-autos operating from Kochi Metro stations charge Rs 30 for a 2-km long journey. It takes about two hours to fully recharge the auto batteries and it can travel up to 55km. These vehicles carry passengers from one point to another within a 2km radius.

The e-auto drivers operate services from 7.30am to 10.30pm. “I used to drive a diesel auto for a long time, and for the past one year I have been driving an e-auto. The e-auto service is not much complicated as it operates in a small radius. It makes my job less stressful while riding through the traffic in Kochi city. Commuters are providing a huge support to the eco-friendly initiative by choosing the e-auto service,” said Ashique, an e-auto driver at Maharaja’s College Metro station.

114,['12/02/2020'],"NABARD’s refinance to banks drops by Rs 1,600 crore","This story is from February 12, 2020

Ahmedabad: Thanks to the slowing growth in lending for agriculture loans, National Bank for Agricultural and Rural Development (NABARD)’s refinance to banks across Gujarat fell by Rs 1,600 crore in the first three quarters of 2019-20, against the previous financial year. NABARD provides refinance to banks for extending priority sector loans. According to data furnished by NABARD, a sum of Rs 9,000 crore was extended to banks from April to December 2019, vis-à-vis Rs 10,600 crore during the same period in 2018.

Explaining reasons, D K Mishra, chief general manager, NABARD, Gujarat Regional Office, said, “The overall credit growth has been impacted due to the economic slowdown. It is a national phenomenon.

The growth in lending of agriculture term loans has slowed. As a consequence, the refinancing extended to banks has also declined. However, the same has now picked up.”

In 2018-19, NABARD extended funds worth Rs 11,400 crore to banks, said Mishra while speaking to the reporters during a media briefing on Tuesday, a day before the launch of state focus paper for 2020-21.

In Gujarat, NABARD had estimated Rs 1.15 lakh crore as credit potential for 2019-20.

The credit potential for 2020-21 will be announced on Wednesday, during the state credit seminar, organized by the state-owned financial institution in Gandhinagar.

As part of the rural infrastructure development fund (RIDF), NABARD has cumulatively extended credit worth Rs 30,000 crore to Gujarat till date. “Nearly 70% of these funds were utilized for irrigation infrastructure. We extended Rs 13,000 crore to the state for Saurashtra-Narmada Avataran Irrigation (SAUNI) Yojana.”

Mishra also said that NABARD has formed some 190 farmer producer organisations (FPOs), which covers some 35,000 farmers across Gujarat. “We plan to add 50 more FPOs at the end of the current financial year. Of these, 35 have already been formed and funds of Rs 60 lakh have been released,” he said.

Sambalpur: To promote handicrafts, the Odisha Rural Development and Marketing Society (ORMAS) has decided to convert Laxmipriya store, which is located in front of the office of the District Rural Development Agency (DRDA) here, into a crafts emporium.

The Laxmipriya store was established by the DRDA in 1990 to sell items produced by self-help groups (SHGs) in the district. The store has been lying shut since last few months and its building is in a dilapidated condition.

Assistant director of ORMAS Srimanta Hota said the building will be renovated. “Around Rs 4.5 lakh will be spent on renovation of the building to convert it into a crafts emporium. The renovation work will be executed by Dhankauda block”. Currently, the building has an asbestos roof. It will be converted into a concrete roof. The plan and design for the building has already been readied.

He said many SHGs are involved in making bamboo products, terracotta and wooden handicrafts. “We will facilitate marketing of the products at the emporium,” he said. He said the government is providing SHGs financial assistance besides skill development training for promotion of handicrafts. The crafts emporium here will be the place for display and sale of beautiful products.

He said “We have also planned to set up a crafts store on the line of the crafts emporium in every block. We have already written to the government for setting up such stores in nine blocks of the district so that the handicrafts produced by SHGs can be sold at the block level too.”

Official sources said around 200 SHGs produce different types of handicrafts. They will benefit from this move.

Representative image

PUNE: An interstate vehicle stealing gang made crores of rupees by swapping engines and the chassis numbers of stolen cars with scrapped ones and putting them up for sale.

Chanprit Harvinderpal Singh (43) of Ravet and his accomplice would purchase scrapped vehicles from insurance companies. They would then travel to north India and steal cars of the same models from Delhi, Punjab, Haryana and other states.

Singh and his accomplice would drive the stolen cars to his garage in Ravet. They would change the stolen car’s engine and chassis numbers with the scrapped cars engine and chassis number and sell the cars.

The crime branch of the Pimpri Chinchwad police recently arrested Singh and recovered 12 stolen cars and 15 engines collectively worth Rs 2.19 crore from him.

The police team was led by inspector Uttam Tangade. It recovered 12 cars which the duo had sold in Pune, Pimpri Chinchwad, Navi Mumbai, Satara and Goa. The 15 engines were recovered from the garage in Ravet and a godown in Kondhwa, assistant commissioner of police (Pimpri Chinchwad) R R Patil said.

On January 26, assistant police inspector Ganesh Patil and police constable Sachin More received a tip-off that a person was operating a garage in Ravet where a large number of engines and spare parts were available and that two cars were parked there.

“Our team raided the garage and took Singh into custody. We found two cars and the engines of different models of the cars,” Patil said.

They found that one of the cars had a Maharashtra registration, but the engine number showed that the vehicle was registered in Punjab. “We arrested Singh and produced him before the court. He was sent to 13 days in police custody,” Patil said.

Singh told the police that he and his accomplices had a garage in Ravet. The duo would purchase vehicles scrapped in accidents from insurance companies along with their documents.

“They would go to Punjab, Haryana or Delhi by flight and steal the same model of the car they had purchased as scrap. They would drive to Pune by road and embossed the scrapped vehicles chassis and engine numbers on the stolen vehicle and sell the stolen vehicle with the documents,” Patil said.

118,['12/02/2020'],RTOs delayregistration of BSVI vehicles,"This story is from February 12, 2020

Chennai: Tamil Nadu’s march towards greener fuel powered vehicles may have to wait as bureaucratic slack coupled with red tape has resulted in new vehicle registrations hitting nadir in the state. The RTOs aren’t according type approvals — a process which involves physical checking of many different variants of a vehicle and the consequential impact is delay in registering BSVI vehicles citing archaic rules despite clarifications from the Union government.

Each vehicle manufacturer has to show every model and variant of its product to the state transport authorities who will then inspect them and give the go-ahead for registrations. The central road transport ministry has asked state transport department officials in March 2017 not to insist on physical verification which became redundant upon migration to a uniform vehicle registration software — Vahan across RTOs in India.

Taking cognisance of delays, the ministry of road transport & highways (MoRTH) has issued a clarification, second one on Monday (the first was in March 2017) asking state governments to register new vehicles as per rules notified under Central Motor Vehicle Act 1998.

The ministry in its advisory on Monday stated that it has come to its notice that in some states, vehicles are not being registered in spite of vehicles having Valid Type Approval (road worthiness, certificate from authorised testing agencies) and that each model of the vehicle is subjected to physical inspection by the state transport department before registration.

India’s largest passenger car maker Maruti bemoaned the inordinate delays at the RTOs in the state. “Vehicle registrations in Tamil Nadu takes the longest time. It’s the same, be it BSIV or BSVI or any other vehicle. There are delays in Gujarat too, but the delays are maximum in Tamil Nadu,” a Maruti spokesperson told TOI.

“Tamil Nadu is the only state which asks for type approvals of each model/variant. With BSVI kicking in from April 1, the transport department is insisting on physical verification of each model and variant (including colour) despite an earlier clarification in March 2017 where MoRTH had said it was not necessary as details of all approved models were available in the centralised Vahan software of the ministry,” said S Rajavel, president, Tamil Nadu Auto Dealers Association . “This means, the transport department has to physically inspect nearly 2,500 models (from now until March 31) and variants of BSVI vehicles which will take months to complete. The resultant impact is that vehicle registration has come to a near standstill,” he said. As on date, an RTO official said that only 90 different models have been approved.

The state transport department officials dismissed the charge of delays. “Everything is smooth and there are no delays at our end. We are only following the various rules and if there is a delay in new vehicle registration, it may be at best sporadic and that may also be because of some procedural ones by a couple of days,” said a senior state transport department official.

Dealers on their part are cribbing. “While on the one hand, we are facing decadal lows on vehicle sales and on the other, the sold vehicles are not getting registered despite coughing up whatever the authorities ask for,” a dealer said on condition of anonymity fearing vindictive action by the RTOs.

Another niggle is that RTOs in the state ask for vehicles to be driven to their offices when no other state insists on, especially after the vehicle data has been uploaded on Vahan. “It is such a waste of time, fuel and in most cases the RTOs don’t even look at the vehicle. Nothing but bureaucratic,” the dealer said.

RTO officials said that registrations are expected resume in full swing only after April 1, 2020 -- date after which BSIV vehicles will not be registered across 145 RTOs in the state.

119,['12/02/2020'],MU commences process of digitising manual ledgers,"This story is from February 12, 2020

Despite setting up of RGUHS, VTU and KSLU, Mangalore University has the task of scanning ledgers having record... Read More

Mangaluru: The process of digitising manual ledgers in Mangalore University has begun in right earnest. Ledgers contain marks of students who passed out in the first 27 years since the university was set up in 1980. All these ledgers are now being scanned, and their images are being stored in digital format, V Ravindrachary, registrar (evaluation), said. The ledgers include those of medical, dental, engineering and law colleges affiliated to the university.

Mangalore University was carved out of University of Mysore in 1980, and became an independent university. Subsequently, medical and dental colleges were brought under the Rajiv Gandhi University of Health Sciences (RGUHS), Bengaluru, engineering colleges under the Visvesvaraya Technological University (VTU), Belagavi, and the law colleges gradually came under the administration of Karnataka State Law University, Hubballi.

Notwithstanding the setting up of RGUHS, VTU and KSLU, Mangalore University has the onerous task of scanning ledgers having records of marks of the medical, dental, engineering and law graduates as well. The process of scanning and digitising ledgers of engineering students has almost been completed, Ravindrachary said. This will help in speedy verification of marks in computers which prospective employers and other agencies seek, he said.

Verification of students can be done in little time by searching in ledgers using key words such as name of student, course, registration number and name of college. “We have sought help of state government undertaking, Karnataka State Electronics Development Corporation Ltd, to undertake this digitisation,” he said, adding with university digitising evaluation records from 2008, there is no need to scan any records from that year onwards.

A M Khan , registrar (administration), said the university in the next step towards digitisation, will digitise personal details of students who have studied in the university from 1980 to 2007. The university has entered into an agreement with National Securities Depository Ltd (NSDL), where this digital database can be shared on the National Academic Depository of MHRD. It will also allow students to gain access to their academic records online.

120,['12/02/2020'],"NHAI yet to get railway approval for RoB, semi-road project to be delayed","This story is from February 12, 2020

Trichy: The National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) is awaiting approval from the Southern Railway to launch civil work for a road over-bridge (RoB) across the railway tracks at Kumaramangalam village as part of the semi-ring road project linking Trichy-Thanjavur NH with Trichy-Madurai NH. “A month back, we sent the RoB’s design to the Southern Railway, Chennai for approval. Their approval is awaited. We will commence the RoB work once we get the nod,” an official with the NHAI said.

While a portion of the much-delayed work between Thuvakudi and Panchapur was slated to be completed before March 2021, the delay in obtaining approval for the RoB is likely to hold up the completion of the project further, official sources said.

The semi-ring road project was mooted in 2007 to decongest the city by interlinking five national highways passing through Trichy. The implementation was bifurcated for administrative reasons with the stretch between Jeeyapuram (Trichy-Karur NH) and Panchapur (Trichy-Madurai NH) classified as stage I, to be implemented by Karur project implementation unit (PIU) of NHAI. Stage II covers Panchapur and Thuvakudi (Trichy-Thanjavur NH), being implemented by the Karaikudi PIU.

As the civil work for stage II did not progress, the NHAI in November 2018 floated a fresh tender to relaunch the road work connecting Panchapur with Thuvakudi via Mathur (Trichy-Pudukottai NH). Though a year has passed, it has not yielded the desired result. Out of the 25km length in stage II, civil work for the RoB across the railway track in Kumaramangalam is crucial to complete the project.

Besides the RoB, around 7-8km of the total 12km stretch between Trichy-Madurai NH and Trichy-Pudukottai NH via Olaiyur is to be laid for completing the stage II that links Panchapur with Thuvakudi via Mathur.

Gfx: Stage II of the semi-ring road:

Panchapur (Trichy-Madurai NH) to Thuvakudi (Trichy-Thanjavur NH)

Implementing agency: NHAI Karaikudi PIU

Total length of stage II: 25km

Length between Thuvakudi and Mathur: 13km

Length between Mathur and Panchapur: 12km

Total pending works’ length: 11km

Pending RoB: Kumaramangalam near Udayanpatti

Panaji: The All India Football Federation (AIFF) will open the doors of the I-League and Second Division to corporate teams next season.

The Indian Super League (ISL) is now Indian football’s premier competition, and with Mohun Bagan joining hands with ATK to play in the ISL from next season, the I-League is set to be dealt another blow. Without the all-captivating Kolkata derby, the I-League would have lost its sheen and the AIFF is keen to add a bit of glamour to its own league.

That can happen next season as the I-League Committee which met in the Capital on Tuesday suggested direct entry for corporate teams and, if needed, additional teams to be promoted from the second division.

“We have 11 teams for now. That number can be extended to 12,” said AIFF vice president and I-League Committee chairman Subrata Dutta. Indian Arrows, AIFF’s developmental side, will continue in the league and remain immune to relegation.

One of the club which has shown more than just passing interest in the I-League is Sudeva FC. The Delhi-based club has played in the second division and regularly field teams in age-category tournaments. According to sources, the club has made their interest known, while two other clubs have also made inquiries. Sudeva’s application, though, could only be considered if the existing teams from Delhi – Garhwal FC – fails to make the cut from the second division this season.

“Once the league gets over, we will take a final call. We will take teams, depending on the number of vacancies we have. We have also discussed that we may promote two teams (to the I-League). Instead of just taking corporate teams, we should also encourage teams who have done well in the second division,” said Dutta, adding that all proposals would need approval from their marketing partners.

CHENNAI: An additional dash of onions sprinkled over chats or uttappams is no longer a luxury. After months of soaring prices, touching almost Rs200 a kilogram, it is now selling at Rs 25 in most retail markets and online stores. And if you shop in Koyambedu, the prices could be up to Rs 5 less.

Besides import, the new onion crop has brought down the prices drastically. The exhorbitant cost of the kitchen staple had affected food prices in eateries and even led to onion thefts. Since the onion yield now is good, the market is again getting supplies from Nasik, Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka. “We are back to normal. We have more supply than the demand. So, cost has come down,” said R Sounderrajan, head of the Koyambedu Onion Trader Association.

Cost of other veggies such as tomatoes, beans, carrots, capsicum and cauliflower are also low. While a kilogram of radish and bottle gourd is retailing at Rs10, tomatoes and okra cost Rs12 per kg, premium quality of cauliflower and a kilo of beans is sold at Rs20. “They cost up to Rs5 lesser in Koyambedu,” said Rajesh Kumar, who has a retail shop at Koyambedu market.

Almost nearing the end of season, peas is being sold at Rs35 a kg, butter beans at Rs100 and double beans at Rs80. Spicy ingredients like green chillies and ginger are also easy on the pocket at Rs15 per kg.

The only vegetable still causing a heartburn for households is the drumstick at Rs110 per kg. “One stick costs Rs12 even in Koyambedu,” said Sounderrajan. “But in a few weeks it will come down to Rs10 for three to five sticks. Soon, we will have a good harvest within the state,” he said.

NAGPUR: The Medical Council of India (MCI) board of governors (BOG) has advised Union health ministry to allow non-doctors, with relevant degrees like (MSc microbiology and biochemistry) to issue pathology reports.

Presently, all diagnostic reports can be signed only by a qualified pathologist (MD in pathology). The MCI recommendation has, however, evoked sharp reactions from qualified pathologists from across the country.

“The BOG has considered this matter at length. In our view, technical reports stating test results without recording any medical opinion on it can be signed by an MSc in medical biochemistry/medical microbiology or with PhD in relevant subjects,” says the letter issued by MCI secretary general Dr RK Vats to various authorities in the ministry of health and family welfare.

As soon as this letter, dated February 3, 2020, got circulated among the fraternity, Maharashtra Association of Practising Pathologists and Microbiologists came out condemning the BOG stand.

“The BOG is trying to legalize the actions of those who are unauthorized to analyse and sign the diagnostic reports. If accepted by health ministry, this will promote quackery which is already creating life threatening problems for people,” said Dr Sandeep Yadav , president of the association.

“In Maharashtra, there are more than 8,000 laboratories where technicians with MSc, MLT, DMLT and similar qualification are conducting tests. However, the test results have to be analysed and signed by qualified pathologists only. If the technicians are allowed to sign and hand over the reports to patients directly, it will reduce the importance of pathologists,” Dr Yadav explained.

Pathologist Dr Prasad Kulkarni claimed no MBBS student will opt for MD in pathology if this becomes a law. “With thousands of roadside labs running across the country, MBBS graduates are not opting pathology as branch of specialization. This year, 81 PG pathology seats out of total 226 in the country have remained vacant. Similar trend was seen in the last three years. If this continues, there will be drastic decrease in number of pathologists in the country,” he said.

At present, 3,500 pathologists are registered with Maharashtra Medical Council (MMC).

125,['12/02/2020'],House panel seeks Rs 7200 cr more during meeting with rail min,"This story is from February 12, 2020

Bhubaneswar: An Odisha assembly panel has sought an additional assistance of Rs 7,200 crore for pending and new railway projects during a meeting with Union railway minister Piyush Goyal in New Delhi on Tuesday. The amount is over and above the Rs 4,373 crore that has been allocated for Odisha in the railway budget for the 2020-21 financial year.

The panel, led by speaker Surya Narayan Patro, also demanded an increase in allocation for railway projects in Odisha. Union minister Dharmendra Pradhan was present in the meeting that lasted for nearly 90 minutes.

“We raised the issue of reduction in allocation by nearly Rs 1,600 crore to the state for 2020-21 compared to the previous fiscal. The railway minister said there will be no dearth of funds for development of railway projects,” commerce and transport minister Padmanabha Behera, who was part of the committee, said.

Odisha has received a reduced allocation of Rs 4,373 crore against Rs 5,993 crore in the current 2019-20 fiscal. Included in the demand for Rs 7,200 crore assistance is additional funding for the Khurda Road-Balangir project, the Jeypore-Nabarangpur project and the Jeypore-Malkangiri projects.

Sources said the state government has sought Rs 800 crore for the Khurda Road-Balangir line against the allocation of Rs 520 crore. Sanctioned in 1994-95, only 92 km of the 289-km project has been completed so far. Delay in land acquisition and low fund flow from the Centre are believed to be some of the reasons behind the project’s delay.

As the state government has committed to bear 50 per cent of the project cost and provide land for the project for free, the committee has urged the railway minister to expedite the project that would pass through some of the economically backward districts like Nayagarh, Boudh, Sonepur and Balangir.

The committee also demanded Rs 250 crore for the Jeypore-Nabarangpur project and Rs 230 crore for the Jeypore-Malkangiri line against the present allocation of Rs 20 crore and Rs 33 crore, respectively. Both the projects were approved in 2016-17.

The panel also demanded several new lines like Gunupur-Theruvali-Rayagada link, Bargarh-Padampur-Nuapada line, Talcher-Gopalpur, Puri-Konark and Bhadranchalam-Malkangiri lines.

Pune: A medical practitioner and a clerical staff of the Zilla Parishad office were booked on February 4 for allegedly fudging bills worth Rs32,000 of a medical camp that was conducted as part of the National Health Mission (NHM) between March and November last year in the Dehu Road Cantonment Board-limits.

The Pune Zilla Parishad (ZP) monitors programmes under the NHM and provides funds for the same.

An RTI activist got to know of the forgery in January and approached the ZP officials. The activist sought details of the medical camp using the RTI application and the ZP’s reply stated that no such camp was held in the Dehu Road Cantonment area, the police said.

The activist lodged an FIR with a local court last month, which directed the Samarth police on January 31 to book the duo.

The police registered an offence under Sections 420 (cheating) and 468 (forgery for purpose of cheating) of the Indian Penal Code. The ZP officials have also launched an inquiry into the illegalities of the incident.

The FIR stated that the duo conducted a medical camp at Dehu Road. Later, the two obtained the bills from the pandal vendor, medicine vendors and others. They collected bills totally amounting to Rs32,000 and submitted them to the ZP’s Haveli Panchayat Samiti office, seeking funds under the NHM.

A senior police officer told TOI, “We have questioned the taluka medical officer and have recorded his statement. We are verifying the facts according to his statement.”

The officer added that a team would soon visit Dehu Road and question the pandal, medicine and other vendors who provided material for the medical camp, whose bills were processed by the ZP.

“However, the ZP’s documents tell another story. It maintains that no such camp was held while the medical practitioner said that it was,” the officer said, adding the clerical staff of the ZP office had processed the bills.

“We are trying to ascertain who actually got benefited from the forgery and cheating and how the bills were forged and processed,” the officer said.

The police and ZP officials are probing if there were more such instances. A team headed by senior inspector Balkrishna Kadam is investigating the case.

Ahmedabad: The Gujarat high court on Tuesday ordered the Centre and the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to file replies by February 25 to a PIL objecting to strikes by bank employees, demanding that strikes by public sector bankers be declared illegal.

For the petitioner trade federations, advocate R C Jani told the HC that during a two-day bank strike, 31 lakh cheques remained unprocessed and caused a shutdown by private banks, resulted in stalling transactions worth Rs 23,000 crore across the country. Moreover, ATMs ran out of cash and remained unreplenished.

The petitioner’s advocate also rebutted the reply filed by the employees’ union that they had gone on strike in public interest. By citing figures, he argued that bank strikes hurt the public interest. On hearing the arguments, the bench headed by Chief Justice Vikram Nath asked if the central government was sleeping over the developments why it did not reply to the earlier court notice.

The high court posted the matter for February for direction, the petitioner’s advocate said.

Earlier, the HC asked the Centre and RBI what action they can take against striking bank employees because strikes put people at an inconvenience.

The petitioners filed the PIL after public sector bank employees called a strike at the turn of the month. They have also threatened a strike in March.

Gandhinagar: A workshop series on climate change — Climate Action Now (CAN) 2020 — was inaugurated on Tuesday at the Indian Institute of Technology Gandhinagar (IIT-Gn) by S J Haider, principal secretary, climate change department of the state government.

Haider called for collective action to mitigate the effects of climate change. He said, “The prospects of climate change are staring at us in our face and it is high time we understand the seriousness of this phenomenon. The concerns arising out of climate change cannot be addressed only by the government or the academia, but each and every member of the society.”

He added that simple things like saving energy and water, liquid and solid waste management, rainwater harvesting etc. can help in reversing the effects of climate change.

Haider said that the Gujarat state action plan on climate change, which incorporates nine thematic areas, is being revisited with additional targets and objectives to align with the national commitment for the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals 2030.

“We are ensuring that carbon footprints should not increase while augmenting infrastructure and taking up activities on various fronts. Given the higher vulnerability of rural areas to the ill-effects of climate change, we are going to incorporate ingredients of climate resilience under the Government of India’s Gram Panchayat District Plan (GPDP) for rural areas,” the official said. tnn

Pune: At the Happy Streets held at the serene Corinthians Club on Sunday, patrons unwinded to the Zumba and Yoga routine for the near-three hours of the event.

On the main stage, dancers from Bollybeats and Core Zumba, as well as the trainer Rahil Chowhan, took turns to lead the assembled crowd through a playful and exercise-laden song-and-dance routine.

Cross Strength also had a power activity on stage, where they demonstrated and urged people to participate in kick-boxing and agility training exercises.

Sahajyoga and Maria’s Yoga and Pranayam set up yoga corners, where people chose to perform flexibility exercises in a more traditional way.

“We do the Zumba routine with Latin music in the background, mainly because the person who came up with Zumba was a Colombian. The crux of the routine is to shed the feeling of a workout, and more of a party, so that people in the Zumba routine can have fun while working out. We always get a very good response at Happy Streets. We have been associated with this event since its initiation days in the city,” said Neha Shukla, who was at the Happy Streets routine on Sunday, along with her fellow dancer-trainer Shivani Jain, for Core Zumba.

Happy Streets is an initiative of The Times of India in association with the Pune police, Pune traffic police, Pune Municipal Corporation and is powered by Nyati.

130,['12/02/2020'],GB rejects proposed 12%increase in property tax,"This story is from February 12, 2020

Pune: Citizens will not be burdened with enhanced property tax as the general body of the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) rejected the tax hike on Tuesday. The municipal commissioner had proposed a 12% increase in the property tax while presenting the draft civic budget.

Corporators expressed their opposition to the hike saying that it was unjust to the taxpayers.

Civic officials should focus on untapped properties to recover tax. The civic body should also make sure that pending tax dues are collected, they added.

“The civic administration is showing double standards while imposing the tax and carrying out the recovery drive,” the corporators at the meeting said.

“The owners of smaller properties are targeted during the recovery. But discounts and waivers are offered to leading IT companies and commercial establishments. It is leading to loss of revenue for the PMC,” they added.

They rejected the demand to hike the tax and stressed on offering amnesty schemes for common citizens.

Corporators also demanded that the bigger tax defaulters should be targeted on priority.

The standing committee had rejected the proposed tax hike during the last week of January.

While presenting the draft budget for PMC in 2020-21 in January, municipal commissioner Shekhar Gaikwad proposed a 12% hike.

He tabled a budget of Rs 6,229 crore which was Rs 144 crore higher than last year's budget of Rs 6,085 crore.

The increase included a 5.5% hike in general tax, 1.5% in water benefit tax and 5% in sewage benefit charges.

Civic administration was hoping to mop up additional income of Rs 150 crore from the hike.

The tax revision has been rejected by the general body for the second consecutive year. The civic administration had proposed to increase the tax by 12 % in 2019-20 too to mop up Rs 110 crore.

131,['12/02/2020'],Why declaring Cauvery delta region a protected agri zone is not enough,"This story is from February 12, 2020

Chennai: Tamil literature abounds with examples on the fertility of Cauvery and its delta region. ""Sozha vala naadu sorudaithu"" (There is no dearth of food in the fertile country of Cholas) says an old adage. The celebrated epic Silappathikaram speaks of how the Cauvery nurtures the Chola country like a mother.

Today, the Cauvery Delta is no longer the major source of food for Tamil Nadu. In the past four decades, the state’s dependence on Cauvery delta for food has fallen from 65% to 40%. This fall has different reasons — hydrocarbon wells, being chief among them. The controversy over Cauvery river water, aggressive sand mining and real estate, made it worse for the rich delta. The green revolution had made farmers extensively dependent on groundwater. Since groundwater became contaminated after hydrocarbon extraction, agricultural output was affected.

The announcement by the Tamil Nadu government to make the Cauvery delta a protected agricultural zone is perhaps a small attempt to salvage some glory of the delta. The chief minister said legal experts will be consulted and no scheme detrimental to agriculture will be allowed in the delta region. This is a huge, progressive move if implemented.

As environmentalists, we have noted with concern the growing exploitation of Cauvery and its delta. In his seminal study on Nagapattinam, water expert S Janakarajan has illustrated how the Nagapattinam district might disappear in the next two decades. Sea levels have been rising in Nagapattinam and already areas have gone below mean sea level. There have also been instances of seawater intrusion — sea water filling the vacuum caused by hydrocarbon extraction. Further, the delta is sinking due to sand mining and stoppage of inflow of silt due to construction of dams upstream of Cauvery.

The Centre’s announcement to set up 489 hydrocarbon wells in Puducherry and the eight delta districts, and parts of Ramanathapuram was shockingly unprecedented. The wells are intended to serve the ONGC and Vedanta. Also, hydrocarbon extraction that has happened till now in the delta, though objectionable, has remained conventional. There were more than 700 wells that ONGC dug, of which around 180s are operational. Conventional extraction had its own repercussions — sea water intrusion, rusting of pipes leading to leaking of oil, and in turn groundwater contamination. Kathiramangalam is an example of this groundwater contamination.

The permission for new hydrocarbon extraction that was intended to be given was non-conventional, which means it grants open access and is consequently more dangerous. This means the agency can extract any hydrocarbon and in return pay a certain royalty to the government. The method of hydraulic fracking would be employed for the purpose by which crores of litres of water and hundred-odd chemicals would be pumped during each fracking. This will pollute the land, and render it unusable. It is pertinent to note that the world is increasingly turning against hydrocarbon. The impact of climate change has necessitated slogans like carbon-free and fossil-free world. At this juncture, to set up hydrocarbon wells in India and in TN is patently short-sighted and viciously dangerous.

With the announcement of the state, this impending danger might stop. But the state also needs to walk the talk. Two days ago, TN announced setting up of a petroleum refinery at a cost of Rs50,000 crore. Setting up industries not related to food does not augur well for a zone announced as protected agricultural zone. Such announcements will undoubtedly invest fear in the minds of the people in the delta despite the state’s just announced decision.

Two things can be done to allay fears: Set up a legal team to implement the decision of making the Cauvery delta a protected agricultural zone, and withdraw cases against people who fought against the hydrocarbon projects. With these steps, the state will get down to translating its promises into action.

Pune: Don’t worry if you break into a sweat in the middle of the night. No, it’s not your body acting up but the weather playing truant.

Even though it is February, many locations in the state, including Pune, have been recording March-like night temperatures since the last couple of days. For instance, Shivajinagar recorded 16.7 degrees C as its minimum temperature on Tuesday early morning, which is the normal minimum temperature in the location in March.

Lohegaon recorded an even higher minimum temperature at 17.6 degrees C on Tuesday. The normal daily March minimum temperature in Pune is 16.5 degrees C, but Shivajinagar and Lohegaon recorded minimum temperatures higher than this on Tuesday. Other locations like Nashik, Kolhapur, Satara, Sangli, Malegaon showed similar March-like minimum temperature readings on Tuesday. Night-time mercury is surging to such high levels that Pune on Tuesday was among locations that recorded the highest positive minimum temperature departures in Maharashtra.

On Tuesday, Nashik’s minimum temperature was 15.8 degrees C, which is its daily March minimum temperature. Kolhapur recorded 20.5 degrees C on Tuesday, which was higher than its normal daily March minimum temperature of 19.6 degrees C. While Sangli’s daily minimum temperature in March is 18.8 degrees C, it recorded minimum temperature of 20.8 degrees C on Tuesday. The India Meteorological Department (IMD) data on Tuesday showed that Madhya Maharashtra, which includes districts like Pune, Nashik, Ahmednagar, Kolhapur, Jalgaon and Mahabaleshwar, among others, has been recording the highest positive minimum temperature departures in the country lately. IMD officials said that minimum temperatures were above normal (5.1°C or more) at isolated places over Madhya Maharashtra; above normal (3.1°C to 5.0°C) at many places over Saurashtra and Kutch; at a few places over Konkan-Goa and Andaman and Nicobar Islands; at isolated places over Assam, Meghalaya; above normal (1.6°C to 3.0°C) at many places over Gujarat region, among others.

Anupam Kashyapi, head of weather, IMD, Pune, told TOI that the main cause of such high minimum temperatures, especially in Madhya Maharashtra, is the easterly/south-easterly wind pattern as winds are coming from the Bay of Bengal. These winds are dragging some moisture from the sea. “Wednesday’s minimum temperatures are likely to be more or less the same in the state. An anti-cyclone over central India and a cyclonic circulation from south Maharashtra and adjacent coastal Karnataka at lower-atmospheric level is blocking the flow of cold northerly winds, restricting their entry into Konkan and Madhya Maharashtra especially,” said Kashyapi.

Representative image

CHENNAI: In two months, toll plazas along East Coast Road ( ECR ) and Old Mahabalipuram Road (OMR) in Chennai and its outskirts will get radio frequency identification (RIFD) based FASTag lanes .

Adopting the National Highways Authority of India’s electronic toll collection (ETC) mode that was designed to ensure nonstop movement of vehicles at toll plazas, cashless payment, ease traffic congestion and cut travel time, the Tamil Nadu Road Development Corporation (TNRDC) has, a week ago, begun installation of FASTag readers in lanes of the 11 plazas, five of which are on ECR and six on OMR.

Last December, NHAI enabled all 482 lanes of 48 toll plazas in Madurai region (22) and in Chennai region (26) to read FASTag. Following sustained efforts and campaigns by the authority, more than 60% of vehicle owners have switched to FASTag, said an NHAI official.

TNRDC’s decision to replicate ETC will help road users. “It will take nearly two months to equip the plazas with FASTag readers. Simultaneously, we will update the existing system with ETC software. It will facilitate the local resident pass (LRP) holders to use FASTag lanes. If they have already fixed FASTag, it will be integrated with their LRP,” said an official in TNRDC.

On an average, 1.50 lakh vehicles pass through the plazas on ECR and OMR a day. Of them, nearly 25,00 are those of LRP holders.

The move will also come as a relief for regular office goers. At present, they either pay cash or obtain a monthly pass. “We are availing the monthly trip card. Though I can use it for 60 trips a month, I am using it for a maximum of 40 trips. But I have to pay the full amount to renew the monthly card. Many office goers pay for 15 to 20 unused trips every month. We hope the new system will address the issue,” said an ECR resident. He said it would save time and avoid unwanted quarrels with staff manning the plazas.

Asked about motorists paying for more trips than they make, a TNRDC official said, “We will address issues related to trip cards and streamline the system to ensure hassle-free travel.”

Sources said the factory did not have NOC from fire department

KOCHI: A factory engaged in processing scrap rubber at Pinarmunda near Pallikkara caught fire on Tuesday endangering a house and a plywood factory nearby. The factory called Fine Grinders, which manufactures rubber sheets utilizing scraps of rubber discarded by footwear units was completely gutted.

Officials of the department of fire and rescue services said they got the call regarding the fire at 12.05pm. “We had to struggle for around five hours to contain the fire which was threatening two buildings nearby. While one building was a house the other was a plywood factory,” said an official attached with Thrikkakara fire station. The factory is located in the limits of Pattimattom fire station.

Around eight units of fire force were deployed to douse the fire, officials said. Apart from firefighting units from Thrikkakara and Pattimattom, vehicles came from Perumbavoor , Gandhinagar and Tripunithura. The service of a fire engine from Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd which could spray foam finally helped them contain the fire.

Officials at the Pattimattom station said they had to return to the spot at around 6.30pm after fire was reported again in the factory owned by V K Aliyar. “It was smouldering again when we reached the factory after the second call. The fire is now under control,” said the official. The firefighting operation was led by district fire officer Gogy J S.

“The factory building was single-storeyed with truss work and rubber waste was stored in large quantities,” said an official. The machinery and raw material in granule form was also lost in fire.

Sources said though the factory had a panchayat license they did not have NOC from fire department.

A major fire broke out at footwear brand Paragon’s warehouse at Kalathiparambil Road in Kochi in February last year. The fire force director A Hemachandran had directed officials to take strict action against buildings which do not have NOC from the fire department.

Coimbatore: Farmers in Pachapalayam , Perur , say the check dam in the village is of no use as it is built on a rocky terrain that doesn’t allow water to percolate and recharge the groundwater table.

As a result, water level in villages such as Perur Chettipalayam, Arumuga Goundanur and Rama Chettipalayam, has gone down and they had to drill borewells up to 1,000 feet to get water, farmers, who cultivate banana, tomato and other vegetables, say.

M Sundaram had to drill 23 borewells on his five-acre farm to find water. “Four of them had to by dug up to 1,000 feet to get water. The situation has worsened over the last 15 years.”

The check dam edges a pond known as Pachapalayam Kuttai or Kavundanur Kuttai. There are two inlet streams to the pond and an outlet. The entire system is situated on a rocky terrain.

Farmers say a borewell recharge pit should be drilled in the check dam. “A 10ft X 10ft soak pit should be dug around the mouth of the borewell and it should be filled with gravel. Only then, when there is water in the check dam, it would percolate and recharge groundwater,” says R Kulandaivel, another farmer.

P Kandasamy, a representative of the Farmers Association, says they represented the issue to agriculture officials and also district administration officials. “We have been representing the issue for three years now, to no avail.”

When contacted, collector K Rajamani promised to send engineers to the region and analyse what can be done to solve the issue.

Pune: The fifth edition of the northeast film festival, titled Fragrances from the Northeast, will be held from February 14 to 16 at the National Film Archive of India (NFAI) and at Symbiosis’ ELTIS auditorium here.

Altogether 16 films, including feature-length films, shorts, as well as acclaimed documentaries, in various languages and localised dialects from the states of the northeast will be screened at the festival. The NFAI grounds will also host a food and handicrafts festival during the duration of the festival. A renowned rock band from Nagaland will also perform at the festival.

“This festival has become an integral part of our cultural calendar, so much so that people often enquire about the dates of the festival, and directors are willing to send their films to us. In an earlier festival we hosted, I had recommended the film Parasite. At this festival some great films will be screened too, such as Aamis,” said Prakash Magdum, the NFAI director.

Aamis, an Assamese language film, premiered at last year’s TriBeCa Film Festival in New York City, and focuses on people bonding over food. Cuisine is a theme across many films at the festival, as are long-running conflicts and lives devastated by it, such as the Bodo and ULFA insurgencies in Assam.

One of the guests of honour at the festival will be Lin Laishram, an acclaimed model and an actress from Manipur, with others being filmmaker Aribam Syam Sharma, and cast and crew of other films which will be screened at the festival.

As for music at the festival, the organisers have invited Tetseo Sisters, a singing quartet from Nagaland, who have earned name and fame by blending folk music from all parts of northeast India with western music. The band uses both indigenous and western music instruments, and their unique brand of music has seen them being invited to major music festivals in India and across the world.

MSB students visit Singapore on study tour

Seven students of Standard VII from MSB Educational Institute recently went on a study tour to Singapore through the initiative ‘FutureSake’, designed to provide students with a holistic understanding of the challenges of urbanization and receive a sustainable orientation of the world around them.

The students included Adnan Poonawala, Yusuf Kanorewala, Amatullah Thaker, Sakina Rampurawala, Zahabiya Vakharia, Adnan Poonawala and Mariya Poonawalaare.

Through the course of the programme, the students engaged with the environmental realities of their home city, which was followed by an intense research expedition to study Singapore — one of the world’s most sustainable cities. They were equipped with the competencies to meet the evolving challenges of urban habitat expansion and its simultaneous environmental stress.

Each day of the five-day programme was designed around sustainability issues for land use, water, biodiversity, mobility, waste, energy and food.

They also visited the MacRitchie Reservoir, Gardens by the Bay, Land Transport Authority and Marina Barrage, among other places.

The students will shortly initiate sustainable practices at school. The heads, Zeenat Shaikh and Talib Tapia, said Singapore strived to create a vibrant and sustainable city in spite of shortage of resources. During the study tour, the students were exposed to cities or habitats where individuals and organizations had taken encouraging steps to embrace a sustainable way of living to potentially inspire a change in their own lifestyles, they said.

143,['12/02/2020'],Concerns about teachers’ transfer reaches panel,"This story is from February 12, 2020

Pune: The state-level study group of various zilla parishad (ZP) chiefs is working on recommendations to simplify the teacher transfer process that was taken online in 2017. As many as 28 teacher organizations across the state are in the city to raise their concerns.

The organizations have turned their attention towards issues such as the transfer process including disabled teachers being transferred regularly and away from home, demand for husband-wife teachers to be transferred in the same district, continuation of service in the same place for minimum of three years, among others. The study group will submit their recommendations by the end of the month to the state government.

The study group is headed by Pune ZP chief executive officer Ayush Prasad, while Raigad ZP CEO Dilip Halde is the member secretary. Chandrapur ZP CEO Rahul Kardile, Nandurbar ZP CEO Vinay Gowda and Osmanabad ZP CEO Sanjay Kolte are other members of the study group.

The teacher organization and associations met with the committee on Monday and raised issues related to online transfers. Some key concerns issues included having separate transfer guidelines for remote areas and urban areas, preference to be given to disabled candidates, model teacher award winners to be incorporated into the top class category, action against teachers giving false information, announcement of waiting list of inter-district transfers, among others.

Prasad said, “We have been meeting various stakeholders with respect to teacher transfers since Monday. We will also meet organized teacher groups and are reaching out to teachers individually to seek their inputs, improve the process and eliminate all loopholes.”

Prasad said after the online system was made available, many issues were resolved barring a few that needed to be streamlined. Overall teachers were happy with the online process as it maintained transparency, he added.

The committee will submit a draft of the recommendations to the state government by the end of the month. The transfers take place in May, before the start of new academic year, to maintain a balance between administration and teachers’ needs.

146,['12/02/2020'],Hotels lose business as protesters turn up heat,"This story is from February 12, 2020

Coimbatore: Owners of hotels , restaurants , bakeries and small eateries in the city are bemoaning loss of business after police reportedly forced them to close the establishments in view of the protests against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2019 and other civil disobedience movements.

Several such establishments on the Puliyakulam Road and some on the Avinashi Road, including tiffin centres on pushcarts, were forcibly closed by the city police a few days ago during a rally conducted by pro-Tamil and dalit outfits on Dr Balasundaram Road. Last month, during an anti-CAA protest, many bakeries and hotels were forcibly closed by police.

The hoteliers said they suffered huge losses as they were forced to obey the instruction. As police did not inform them in advance, they could not alert their regular customers and had to discard unused food, they said.

“We don’t know why the city police are afraid of the protesters. It’s their duty to punish those who take the law into their hands. But they ordered business establishments including hotels and bakeries to down shutters during the blue shirt rally and meeting on abolition of caste held here on Sunday evening. Earlier, police used to advise shopkeepers to keep the shops open during protests and public meetings. They began to act tough and target us just two months ago,” said a hotelier.

“Some major hotels located on Avinashi Road and Puliyakulam Road were forcibly closed on Sunday around 9pm. Tiffin centres on pushcarts were also forcibly closed at Lakshmi Mills Junction and VOC Park ground. It made huge loss to the establishments,” he told TOI.

Secretary of the People’s Union for Civil Liberties (PUCL) S Balamurugan blamed the police department. “No law & order issue happened during the Left-wing protests in the city. But police forcibly closed the shops. When the right-wing protesters damaged hundreds of shops and took the law into their hands a few years ago, police did not force the shopkeepers to close the shops. Their action is biased,” he said.

Police commissioner Sumit Sharan said that some eateries on pushcarts and Tasmac outlets were closed as part of precautionary measures. “Our personnel did not force hotels or bakeries to close during the protest,” he said.

Prevention is better than cure, said a senior police officer. “To prevent any untoward incidents during such rallies, we approached some shopkeepers and instructed them not to argue with the protesters if they try to create problems. We cannot deploy personnel at every hotel in the city. We want to maintain peace and law & order in the city. So, we have to take such steps.”

PUNE: Scientists at the National Institute of Virology (NIV) on Tuesday said the novel coronavirus in India was similar to the one reported from Wuhan , without any major mutations.The conclusion was made after sequencing the whole genome of the new strain from the samples of two of the three Wuhan-returned medical students who tested positive for the contagion between January 31 and February 3.Sequencing the genome of the virus was key for diagnostic markers and identification of potential preventive vaccine options, experts said, adding that the genome of an organism contained its hereditary data encoded in its DNA.“After mapping the whole genome, we have found that the novel coronavirus is similar to the one reported from Wuhan. There are no major mutations between them,” senior scientist RR Gangakhedkar, chief of the epidemiology at the Indian Council of Medical Research, told TOI.Asked if the virus was likely to undergo major mutations in the near future, Gangakhedkar said, “The viruses are unpredictable as they keep on evolving. Hence, it is difficult and premature to conclusively say anything now.”The Pune-based NIV has tested over 600 samples for novel coronavirus infection so far. But can NIV handle the increased load if need arises? When asked, Gangakhedkar said, “Yes, NIV can ramp up the capacity, if need be, to testing over 700 samples per day.”On infected patients showing no symptoms of the contagion, he said, “It is true that sub-clinical infection poses challenge to prevent and control any infection. However, strategies to screen the close contacts and their isolation at household level can be useful.”Asked about the best and worst case scenarios, he said, “It would be difficult to describe these scenarios as there are more unknown issues than known in nCoV outbreak.”",pune,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74098113,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-376471,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/novel-coronavirus-in-india-akin-to-wuhan-strain-niv/articleshow/74089816.cms

151,['12/02/2020'],Kundamankadavu: KWA shortcomings exposed,"This story is from February 12, 2020

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Kerala Water Authority , which restarted pumping at the Kundamankadavu pumping station after an initial round of testing following a possible chemical contamination near its source, will have to wait two months for results of a detailed test of the water samples collected from the area.

KWA’s laboratory at the pumping station could assess the samples for 22 parameters against the BIS standard of 52 parameters. The lab is also unequipped to identify the presence of several heavy metals in the water.

On Sunday, KWA had to temporarily stop pumping at Kundamankadavu after residents noticed dead fish in the stream, which drains into the Karamana river around 3km upstream of the pumping station. Officials of city corporation, KWA and police found that a firm engaged in electroplating work was responsible for the chemical contamination of the stream. Workers had dumped Surfolin SK 40, an alkaline soak cleaner for metals, into the drain, which flows into the stream. On learning about the contamination, corporation officials immediately constructed a bund at the point where the stream joins the Karamana river. They also temporarily shut down the firm.

Though KWA stopped pumping for a few hours, it was resumed after samples from the river were found to meet the parameters of potable water. This test was carried out at its lab in Aruvikkara. KWA also sent water samples to the govt analytical lab in the city to test for heavy metals. The results are expected only after two months, officials said.

Corporation officials have also sent samples to the analytical lab. Samples of the dead fish have been sent to Jawaharlal Nehru Tropical Botanic Garden and Research Institute here.

KWA sources said the fund crunch restricts the authority from upgrading its lab at Kundamankadavu. “The lab is capable of testing for almost all parameters of quality drinking water. This is done on samples after treatment. However, the lab could test only 22 parameters, while the samples must clear 52 parameters, as per BIS standards. This includes for heavy metals such as arsenic,” sources said.

Moreover, regular testing is restricted to samples from KWA’s treatment plants. Other systems, which are mostly rural water supply schemes, only undergo monthly checks.

KWA sources said there is no measure to secure sources from various kinds of contamination. “This happens because KWA has no control over the sources. In most cases, the irrigation department has authority over the river, with only a few exceptions, such as Peppara dam. Also, local bodies alone can ensure that there is no illegal dumping of chemicals, waste or sewage into water sources,” they added.

AGRA: Railway Protection Force (RPF) on Tuesday morning nabbed a man from Mathura’s Vrindavan , while conducting a drive against touts who use multiple IDs to book train e-tickets, including Tatkal, on the IRCTC portal. The RPF special task force led by inspector C B Prasad of Mathura junction police station, conducted a raid on a telecommunication store and seized over 625 confirmed train e-tickets worth Rs 14 lakh.

The accused was identified as Raju Yadav (45) of Shikohabad, in Firozabad district . He was booked under the Railways Act.

Speaking with TOI, inspector Prasad said, “We had been receiving inputs from IRCTC about a local agent using multiple IDs to book Tatkal e-tickets for sleeper and AC class berths. A team was formed, which kept tab on this telecom store for a week, before conducting the raid in which the accused was caught red-handed. Our team recovered e-tickets which were booked from multiple accounts.”

“The team also seized several computers, hard disks and ID cards from the tout. During interrogation, he claimed he was using at least 20 IDs to book Tatkal e-tickets, making a profit of up to Rs 1,000 per ticket,” added Prasad.

The drive exposed how travel agents fraudulently grab tickets and sell them at a premium, while thousands of genuine passengers queue up in vain at reservation counters or on the IRCTC portal.

Winning by a landslide in a fiercely competitive arena is no mean feat, but pulling off an encore is nothing short of a miracle. The Arvind Kejriwal-led AAP stunned the nation on Tuesday when it beat back an aggressive BJP to sweep the Delhi polls, winning 62 of 70 seats, a strike rate of 90%.AAP’s tally was just five seats short of 2015’s and its vote share fell by less than a percentage point – and this was in the face of incumbency. The brute majority and transformation of Kejriwal from an insurgent who gatecrashed Delhi’s political arena seven years ago into the city’s undisputed political boss will help restore his status as an important satrap among anti-BJP players. Unlike five years ago, when he had a support cast, AAP’s campaign this time was Kejriwal’s solo play.For BJP, it is another setback. Though Kejriwal had widely appeared to be the overwhelming favourite, the saffron party, which had routed AAP in the Lok Sabha elections in May last year, had launched a no-holds-barred campaign spearheaded by its master strategist, home minister Amit Shah.Shah’s gambit in “nationalising” the local contest by focusing on CAA worked only partly. It helped raise the party’s vote share by 6.4 percentage points but could not stave off the embarrassment of finishing with a single-digit score for the second time running. It extended the run of disappointing shows for the BJP in assembly elections — in the 10 before Delhi, it formed governments in only Arunachal and Haryana.Congress fared worse, drawing a blank yet again and lost its deposit in 63 of the 66 seats it contested — a stunning fall for a party which won three consecutive state elections and was in office until six years ago. The party’s vote share plunged to 4% from 9.7% in the last assembly election and will strengthen doubts about its viability as a contestant, with Delhi appearing set to join the growing list of geographies where it has been reduced to inconsequence.AAP’s victory owes itself to the lure of freebies — power, water and transport — which helped it draw support from the grateful throngs in slum clusters and irregular colonies, besides its performance in public education and health. Kejriwal’s image was a big advantage that got stronger because of BJP’s inability to project a CM face.Congress’s continuing marginalisation helped, given the overlap between AAP’s supporters and what once used to be Congress’s constituency. The return of some erstwhile backers to Congress had seen AAP sliding to the third spot in the LS elections, but clearly it’s recovered from that setback.Kejriwal ran a smart campaign, staying focused on his message of “development”, dodging BJP’s effort to lure him into taking a stand on CAA, and declining to join issue on other contentious issues such as his refusal to give sanction for prosecution of Kanhaiya Kumar and Umar Khalid for allegedly raising “tukde tudke” slogans at JNU.Faced with BJP’s highpress “nationalism” manoeuvre, Kejriwal swiftly improvised and cast himself as a “Hanuman bhakt” and a “hardcore nationalist”. It was a smart counter-measure which de-ideologised the battle just when Shah’s campaign against the Shaheen Bagh protests had appeared to find resonance among significant sections of the majority community, raising the prospect of polarisation along communal lines. The advantage so gained was multiplied by the fact that Kejriwal’s status as BJP’s sole challenger ensured him the support of the minority community.In another midway switch, AAP’s tacticians launched the new “Dilli mein toh Kejriwal” campaign line to frustrate BJP’s attempt to pit him against PM Narendra Modi. Instead, he targeted local BJP leaders, converting the elections into a duel where he appeared to be “Dilli ka dabang” who dwarfed an assembly of saffron lightweights.It was crucial because besides the message of nationalism and Modi’s appeal, BJP had little else going for it. The state unit had been in disarray with the ego conflicts among its leaders defying Shah’s attempt to knock them into a team. After its success on all seven seats in the LS elections, the party frittered away crucial time in waiting for the leadership to name its choice for CM, thus losing the psychological advantage it could have potentially had over AAP. It looked clueless when Kejriwal sought to recover lost ground by announcing freebies and launching an unprecedented publicity blitzkrieg.Shah taking charge did help restore morale and energised the cadre to put up a fight, but by then Kejriwal had already sprinted away. The failure of the three BJP-run corporations to perform only added to the lustre of Kejriwal’s “Acche beete 5 saal” plank.Congress put in no effort at all despite the fact that unlike Kejriwal it had taken a strident stand against CAA. Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra put in perfunctory campaign appearances, leaving a lacklustre state unit — a bench of have-beens — to fend for themselves. Post drubbing, some party leaders insisted the “no-show” was tactical as it did not want anti-BJP votes to split. But the “sacrifice” theory could hardly mask the growing irrelevance of the party in one more geography. The debacle will reinforce the perception that the much-talked about organisational recovery could be a long way off, and encourage non-BJP regional satraps to present themselves as the main alternative to the saffron party.AAP’s victory is significant also in that it marks the arrival of a new crop of leaders. While Kejriwal and his deputy Manish Sisodia stand taller than those arrayed on the saffron side of the field, debut wins by Atishi Marlena, Raghav Chadha and Dilip Pandey will add to AAP’s bench strength in the assembly and make up for the absence of the “founders” — Prashant Bhushan, Yogendra Yadav, Kumar Viswas, Ashish Khaitan and others.Okhla MLA Amanatullah Khan, who was seen as the party’s face in the anti-CAA protest at Shaheen Bagh, registered a huge victory pocketing over 66% of total votes polled. This will also put pressure on BJP to bloody its own young corps now that the state unit has again come a cropper.",elections,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74090871,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-124561,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//elections/assembly-elections/delhi/in-another-landslide-kejriwal-sweeps-90-of-seats-bjp-fails-to-reach-double-digits/articleshow/74090868.cms

Trichy: As part of measures to streamline the signalling system and improve punctuality of trains in real time, Southern Railway has installed data loggers integrated with Control of Application in various railway stations in Trichy railway division including Nagapattinam, Mannargudi, Velankanni, Karaikudi and Puducherry.

The data loggers would keep track of various aspects of signalling while Control of Application records events at all stations. Earlier, this was done manually by officials who control and monitor train operations.

The installation consists of data logger equipment, fault analysis software and a central monitoring unit. The data logger would automatically collect data on a 24-hour basis. This would be connected to a printer for obtaining a copy of the functions recorded. This way it would be possible to generate information of events.

According to a senior official in Trichy division, the equipment has been installed along with Control of Application at Karaikal, Karaikudi, Mannargudi, Mayiladuthurai, Nagapattinam, Puducherry and Velankanni railway stations in the division. Trichy, Thanjavur, Villupuram already have the equipment, he added.

155,['12/02/2020'],"By owning kitchen bins, corporation can have its cake &amp; eat it too","This story is from February 12, 2020

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The city corporation's decision to vest the ownership of kitchen bins handed out to households with itself has come in handy in the wake of a new order from state government which says that corporations should do away with waste-management schemes which entail free or subsidised distribution of facilities and equipment.

The order says that while formulating schemes for waste management using plan funds for 2020-21, corporations shall not include projects in which they distribute equipment either in a subsidized or free-of-cost manner. Exemption is given only to beneficiaries from BPL category.

The corporation which had made use of subsidies to propagate bio-gas plants and pipe-compost units had found itself in a fix when it was pointed out that subsidies had been used up and hence could not be used for kitchen bins. Besides, it was required to get revised sanction from the co-ordination committee. It was at this juncture that the project secretariat of the city corporation dealing with sanitation and waste management pitched the idea of owning kitchen bins being distributed to individual households.

Kitchen bins are considered the corporation's property and are given for free to residents on the condition that it is returned whenever the resident leaves the city permanently. Till now, 15,383 kitchen bins have been installed in households and 50,000 more are to be installed in a phased manner.

While the latest order from the local self-government department could derail subsidy-based source-level waste management by local bodies, the corporation would still be able to continue with its source-level waste management based on kitchen bins, officials said.

The government has been keen on promoting waste-to-energy plants in the district, especially within city corporation limits, contrary to the decentralised waste management being promoted by the civic body. In the 2018-19 and 2019-20 fiscals, the corporation had relied heavily on subsidies from the state to draw many beneficiaries towards installation of pipe-composts and bio-gas plants.

In 2018, the civic body was forced to reduce subsidy rates for installation of bio-gas plants in households following an order issued by the state government. The civic body had to reduce subsidy rates from Rs 6,375 per unit to Rs 5,000 following a government order issued in February 2018.

The corporation had decided to award Rs 4.46 lakh to 70 beneficiaries who had installed bio-gas plants in households at a rate of Rs 6,375 per unit, the health wing then revised the rate and awarded subsidy to the same 70 beneficiaries at a rate of Rs 5,000. The government had directed that the maximum subsidy amount shall be restricted to Rs 5,000.

Audit objections had also posed further trouble for the decentralised waste management subsidy. A beneficiary who had spent an amount for installation of a bio-gas plant from an accredited agency needed to produce a bill and corporation would award the subsidy after inspection. However, the audit wing had demanded that corporation should directly purchase the plant from vendors accredited by Suchitwa Mission and then award the subsidy to beneficiaries.

AGRA: As the World Health Organization (WHO) declared coronavirus as a global emergency, shortage of N95 masks , effective in preventing the virus, is now being reported in the local markets due to high demand and no supply from the manufacturers. Black-marketing has resulted in increase in price of the masks.According to the chemists, the demand of N95 masks has increased in the past 15 days. Besides local residents, tourists visiting the Taj Mahal and other monuments are demanding these masks.A tour guide said, “Local medical shops which fall in the Taj Ganj area are taking advantage of the situation and are selling the original mask at an increased rate. The mask which costs Rs 300, is now being sold for Rs 500. Besides, they are also trying to sell the substandard quality masks with the name of N95.”President of the Agra chemist association Ashu Sharma said, “The outbreak of coronavirus in the neighbouring countries has scared the people. This has led to the demand of N95 masks which has increased significantly. There is shortage of N95 masks in the market. Manufacturers are focusing on exporting the masks to China and neglecting domestic supply.”Head of TB and chest diseases department at SN Medical College Dr Santosh Kumar said, “N95 mask is very helpful in protection from bacteria and virus. It is helpful in protection from the Novel Coronavirus. However, other surgical masks are not helpful in preventing transmission of the virus.”When contacted chief medical officer (CMO) Agra Dr Mukesh Kumar Vatsa said, “We have N95 masks for the staff in the hospitals. However, for the attendants and others we have three- layered masks which can also be used. So far, no case of coronavirus has surfaced in Agra.

158,['12/02/2020'],8 held for illegal adoption of 2 babies,"This story is from February 12, 2020

Trichy: The district police on Tuesday arrested eight people including six women in connection with the illegal sale of a three-month-old baby boy in Thiruverumbur and a 25-days-old baby boy in Kuvalakudi.

The Thiruverumbur police booked the illegal adoptive parents, 29-year-old Ashwini from Kamaraj Nagar and her 31-year-old husband Govindhan, broker Velammal and her accomplice P Lourdhu Mary from Puttrukovil besides the biological mother, a 42 year old woman from Pettavaithalai. They were charged with trafficking and abandoning a child under sections of IPC and Juvenile Justice Act. The police team arrested all four people on Tuesday except Govindhan, who is absconding.

The couple had two daughters and longed for a male child. Since the woman was unable to deliver a baby due to health issues, the couple looked for legal adoption. Velammal introduced herself as a government hospital staff nurse and promised them to get a baby illegally in a short period. After the couple accepted the deal and bought the baby for Rs 1 lakh, Vellamal got Lourdhu Mary to transfer the baby to them. Acting on a tip, the district anti-child trafficking unit (ACTU) enquired the matter and found that the baby was born to a woman of Pettavaithalai in an illicit affair. Velammal persuaded the woman to sell her baby to the couple.

In another case, Thiruverumbur police registered a case against the biological parents of the baby — a 28-year-old woman and her 30-year-old husband of Kuvalakudi — illegal adoptive parents, a 27-year-old woman and 30-year-old husband, from R Pudhupatti, and a conduit, Poongodi from Ariyamangalam, on charges of trafficking and abandoning a child under sections of IPC and Juvenile Justice Act, on Monday night. Except Poongodi, all others were arrested.

The couple from Kuvalakudi already had three children and was unable to bring up a fourth child. Hence, they sold it to their relative, a childless couple, in Pudhupatti on February 1 for which they allegedly got Rs 7,000. Poongodi, a relative of the biological parents, was also part of the illegal activity. All the eight people were produced in court and remanded in judicial custody. Child welfare committee (CWC), Trichy took custody of the babies and handed them over to a specialized adoption agency in Ariyalur on Monday.

Trichy: Air India Express will resume its service to Abu Dhabi from Trichy international airport from the last week of March, after a gap of eight years, apart from launching new services to Doha, Delhi and Madurai.

With these new additions, the total number of international destinations from Trichy will increase to seven and number of services to 98( from 91). In terms of domestic services, it will increase to 70 from the existing 63.

It may be noted that among the tier-2 airports, Trichy airport connects all the major airports in UAE – Dubai, Sharjah and Abu Dhabi, after Cochin and Ahmedabad airports, authorities said.

When contacted, a senior official from Air India Express at Trichy International Airport told TOI an official announcement will be issued within few days.

Till 2009, Air India Express had two (Thursdays and Saturdays) weekly services to Abu Dhabi. It was withdrawn from October 27, 2012, citing operational reasons.

Ever since its withdrawal, Tamils working in Abu Dhabi have been demanding to resume the service.

“Around five to six lakh Tamils hailing from Trichy and surrounding districts are working here for years. They have to reach Sharjah or Dubai first to reach Trichy. It takes three to four hours more than direct travel to Trichy from Abu Dhabi. We have also spent more money on that. Hereafter, our ordeal to reach our home town comes to an end. We thank Air India Express for resuming the service”, said N Malik Mohammed, native of Adhirampattinam in Thanjavur, working with National Petroleum Construction Company (NPCC).

161,['12/02/2020'],‘Delhi has shown Hindus are secular’,"This story is from February 12, 2020

NAGPUR: Aam Aadmi Party ’s (AAP) victory in Delhi has strengthened the confidence of protesters at Nagpur’s own Shaheen Bagh in Farooq Nagar. “The BJP and RSS should take it as a warning sign and mend their ways,” said speakers that included Maulana Tauqeer Raza Khan , a politician-cum-leading cleric of the Barelvi sect of Muslims and JNU professor Hafiz-ur-Rehman who were the main guests on Tuesday.

“The results show that still a majority of the Hindus are secular and are not influenced by sectarian politics. The RSS should realize that its time that it should also consider Muslims as their own and work hand in hand with us,” said Khan

“Those from Nagpur had even come to Bareilly to spread the word against our protests but failed. Now I have come here to give them a reply, ” added said Khan in an indirect reference to the RSS.

“Uddhav Thackeray had realized well in advance that BJP’s decline has begun. He could have easily formed the government in alliance with BJP, but he chose to join hands with NCP and Congress instead. If he continues the good work, we would also elate him to the post of the country’s prime minister. We see him as an alternative to Narendra Modi,” said Khan.

He announced that an indefinite protest will be staged at Jantar Mantar in Delhi. The country’s Muslims from all schools of thought, including Deodand, are united over NRC-the CAA issue, he said. Barelvi and Deoband are the main sects of Muslims often known to be divided over key religious practices.

Khan, who also heads Itehad-e-Millat, a regional outfit in UP, is among the key leaders of the anti-NRC-CAA protests in the state. A couple of days ago he had alleged that Samajwadi Party and BSP have compromised with RSS on the CAA-NRC issue. In 2014 elections however, he had backtracked from the decision to support AAP in 2014 polls.

“The government has so far denied us the permission at Jantar Mantar, but now we have decided to go-ahead even without any approval. The protests will include leaders of all religions who will stay at Jantar Mantar till NRC and CAA are scrapped,” said Khan.

As the protests at Farooa Nagar entered the 10th consecutive day on Tuesday, a crowd of nearly 4,000, mainly women, had gathered at the ground.

Rahman, the JNU professor, said, “The AAP’ victory shows that people of the country vote for developmental issues rather than religion. Delhi has people from all parts of the country, including the North-East. AAP’s victory has sent a message that communalism will not have takers anywhere in India.”

“We have been following the AAP results on phone while sitting here. The party’s candidate has won even in the constituency where Shaheen Bagh is located. This shows that BJP failed to influence the voters against the protests,” said Mushtaq Ansari at Farooq Nagar.

“AAP has won because the party has delivered and people did not get carried away by issues like triple talaaq or Article 370,” said Taranum Begum, a homemaker.

Coimbatore: The state human rights commission (SHRC) directed the state government on Tuesday to pay a compensation of Rs 3 lakh to the wife of man, who had committed suicide in 2013 .

SHRC member A Chittaranjan Mohandoss in his letter to additional chief secretary of state government’s home department said that the sum should be paid to Arukani, wife of Arukutty, who had committed suicide at Chennamalai Karattumedu near Mettupalayam in Coimbatore district, within eight weeks. He also directed the government to initiate departmental action on the then Mettupalayam police inspector Sivakumar for not taking action against the two men, who had cheated Arukutty.

According to the SHRC order, Arukutty had purchased a lorry in 2012. One Krishnankutty and Kanagaraj had a verbal agreement with him to operate the lorry and share the profits monthly. However, the two neither gave the promised payments nor returned the lorry. On November 1, 2012, Arukutty lodged a complaint with inspector Sivakumar of Mettupalayam police station. Even as Arukutty’s financial woes mounted, police said they were not able to trace the whereabouts of Krishnankutty and the lorry.

On January 14, 2013, Arukutty committed suicide. Even after his suicide, police failed to investigate the case properly, SHRC noted. Subsequently, Chinnaraj, Coimbatore district president of the International Human Rights Awareness Organization, sent a complaint to the national human rights commission, which was forwarded to SHRC. “The shoddy treatment of the case of suicide and dereliction of duty in not initiating a proper investigation based on the suicide note wherein the names of Kanagaraj and Krishnankutty are mentioned, is a breach in bringing justice and so a violation of the human rights of the complainant,’’ the order said.

The video taken 25 days ago has surfaced on social media and has gone viral. Government officials said they have sought an explanation and will initiate action.

When she won the local body election beating seven other contenders, some of whom more influential than her, at Kavundachiputhur village panchayat near Dharapuram, R Selvi had come in for praise from various quarters. The reason being Selvi, 32, a ninth standard dropout, had been assisting her husband V Ramesh in cremating bodies in the electric crematorium where he works.

But now she in the news for all the wrong reasons. In the TikTok video, Ramesh is seen seated in her chair in the panchayat office mimicking a movie song. He later apologised for his act.

“I was there in the panchayat office 25 days ago to clean the place. After the cleaning was done, I sat on the new chair to see if it was ok. I made a mistake by taking a video of it. I apologise for what I have done. I will not do it again,’’ he said.

A group of villagers have, however, complained to the district administration seeking action against him.

Panchayat secretary Subramanian said it was true that Ramesh sat in the chair to check if the new furniture was fine. “But it was not right for anyone to sit in the official seat of an elected representative. When we sought an explanation, he apologised,” he said.

However, the officials have sought a written explanation based on which further action would be taken.

Dharwad: The health department is taking all precautionary measures to ensure that the coronavirus does not spread in the district. So far there has been no case reported in the district and in two suspected cases the report is negative, said district health officer Dr Yashwant Madinkar.

Replying to queries from elected representatives at the monthly meeting of the zilla panchayat to review the progress of works under the Karnataka Development Programme (KDP) here on Tuesday, he said two persons who had come from China were admitted to the KIMS Hospital in Hubballi but the results of the tests are negative.

Every person coming from China is being examined and if there are symptoms of the decease, treatment will be provided. Two wards of five beds each have been arranged in the district civil hospital in Dharwad and KIMS hospital in Hubballi. Efforts are on to create awareness about the decease through the officials and Ashas, he informed.

The DHO said that last year 250 persons were affected by dengue in the district and there were no deaths. This year five persons were reported positive for dengue and they are being treated. Under Ayushman Bharat 3.60 lakh cards have been distributed and another 12 lakh cards will be given, he added.

The meeting also discussed the difficulties faced by groundnut growers in five procurement centres set up in Kundgol taluk where the crop shown in the ‘Bele Darshaka’ App is different from what is shown in the software at the procurement centres. ZP president Vijayalakshmi Patil directed the APMC officers to set right the problem.

Vice-president Shivanand Karigar said groundnut is a kharif crop and the procurement centres for groundnut crops are opened when there are rabi crops. It will benefit the farmers if procurement centres are opened soon after the crop is in the hands of the farmers, he said.

CEO BC Satish directed the officials of the agriculture department to look into a complaint from the farmers of Yarebudihal in Kundgol taluk that they have received very low crop insurance amount for jowar. The officials informed that the land under insurance cover has exceeded the land under sowing and the confusion is being set right.

The officers of the irrigation department requested the CEO to see that the Malaprabha water to several tanks in Kundgol and Navalgund taluks be released at fixed intervals so that they can take up the works of repairing the canals. They have not been able to take up the work as the water is released frequently, they said. CEO Satish asked the irrigation officers to take up the repair works in March, April and May when the tanks are full and there is no need to release water through canals.

President Vijayalakshmi Patil expressed her displeasure at the tendency on the part of important officers to remain absent for meetings. “Showcause notices were issued to those who remained absent last time but again many officers have not turned up for the meeting. Those who have come lack information about the works. This cannot be tolerated” she warned.

“The revised DPR of the Punnamoodu ROB will be submitted to KIIFB in two weeks’ time, while that of the Edava ROB will submitted after acquisition of the required land,” the minister said replying to a submission by Varkala MLA V Joy.

The notification for acquiring land for Edava ROB was issued in November 2019, and the procedures are progressing, the minister said.

Joy, in his submission, stressed the need for a speedy construction of these two ROBs considering the development of Varkala, ‘which is fast turning out into a major tourism destination in the state’.

“Besides, the famous Varkala beach, we have fast-developing tourist spots like Kappil Beach and Muthalappozhi in the area. Also, the ROBs are required to smoothen the traffic for Sivagiri pilgrimage,” the MLA pointed out.

Sudhakaran, meanwhile, said the two projects are expected to have a total cost of more than Rs 50 crore. The government gave administrative sanction for allocating Rs 36 crore for the Edava ROB project with Roads and Bridges Development Corporation of Kerala (RBDCK) as the special purpose vehicle (SPV) in February 2017, while KIIFB gave its financial sanction in May 2017, he said.

In case of Punnamoodu ROB, government issued an order appointing RBDCK as the SPV in April 2018 and appointed Institute for Social Advancement as the consultant to prepare the DPR.

“Though the DPR was prepared after fixing the alignment and submitted it to the Indian Railways for approval in March, 2019, it had to be revised as per the Railways’ direction. The consultant submitted the revised DPR in December 2019, and we expect to submit it for KIIFB’s approval in two weeks’ time,” the minister added.

171,['12/02/2020'],FIGHT TILL THE FINISH,"This story is from February 12, 2020

Panaji: Clifford Miranda was away in Germany, interning with RB Leipzig for his Pro Licence coaching course, when all hell broke loose in Goa with the sacking of FC Goa coach Sergio Lobera. There was mayhem on social media with several conspiracy theories, journalists joined the protesting bandwagon too, and while players stayed mum, you could sense there was tension in the air.

Clifford returned to be named interim coach for the rest of the season with Derrick Pereira as technical director, and what he saw in the dressing room was, by his own admission, exactly the same he saw three weeks ago when he packed his bags for Germany.

“When I returned, I could see a normal mood. Normal for us is positive. When I arrived, I could see no difference. Whatever negativity, whatever things are happening inside or around the club, whatever pressure, it’s external. It’s not in the dressing room. The players are in good spirits, raring to go with one aim and that is to finish on top,” Clifford told TOI on Tuesday.

The mood in the dressing room is crucial for Goa’s success at least in the remaining two league games as they chase the top spot and a place in the AFC Champions League, a first for any Indian club. While there may have been some negativity ahead of the last game against Hyderabad FC – which Goa won comfortably – a sense of calm should hold the hosts in good stead as they face Mumbai City FC at the Nehru Stadium in Fatorda on Wednesday.

Goa are tied on points at the top with ATK, but the Kolkata club’s head-to-head advantage means they have to count upon their rivals dropping points to finish on top. Many believe ATK could stumble in one of their two fixtures -- both of which are tricky against the likes of Chennaiyin FC and Bengaluru FC -- and Clifford wants to ensure that they have left nothing to chance.

“For us the equation is simple, win two games and see what happens with ATK. It is their title to lose. The pressure is on them,” said the former India midfielder.

Mumbai are chasing the fourth playoff spot, and given that the have accumulated 10 points from their last four games, Jorge Costa’s side will fancy their chances.

“We have two games till the end of the regular season and we need points to finish in the top four. This will be a difficult game against one of the best teams in the ISL , one team which is always difficult to play against,” said Costa.

Asked if this was a good time to play Goa, without Lobera to guide them, Costa simply smiled, before explaining why nothing has changed.

“They will change nothing. Goa are doing well from the beginning. Honestly, I think Goa doesn’t need to change. They are so good and playing so well, I don’t think they will change players in the first XI. Almost 100 percent, I can tell the first 11 of Goa (against Mumbai), I can tell you how they will play. Only thing I cannot tell is the final result,” said Costa.

Hyderabad: Telangana State Planning Board vice-chairman B Vinod Kumar on Tuesday picked holes in Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman’s claims on releasing Rs 1.58 lakh crore to the state in the last six years.

Rebutting Sitharaman’s claims, Vinod said they were not actual releases by the Centre but revised estimates as indicated in the state budget. On the FM’s claims on releasing tax devolution funds to the tune of Rs 85,013 crore to Telangana, he said they were part of various sources of revenue like income tax, corporation tax, customs duty, etc, which accrue to the state in normal recourse.

He said there was a shortfall in the release of grants to the local bodies and state-specific grants as recommended by the finance commission, adding that Rs 1,428.90 crore was yet to be released to urban local bodies.

Vinod said Rs 450 crore annually for the development of backward regions is yet to be released to Telangana under the AP Reorganisation Act so far.

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Pachathuruthu , a project being implemented by Haritha Keralam Mission, will be unveiled on the premises of a police station for the first time in the district. The project is being executed on 30 cents of land adjacent to Pangode police station.

Pachathuruthu is being jointly executed by Pangode gram panchayat, circle inspector Suneesh and his team and Haritha Keralam. Employees of the employment guarantee scheme were also part of the initiative. D K Murali MLA will inaugurate Pachathuruthu on Thursday at 4pm.

Chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan had inaugurated the Pachathuruthu scheme in 2019. The state-level inauguration was held at Vengodu Junction, in Pothencode panchayat . The project aims at spreading green spaces in the state to combat the adverse effects of climate change.

It will be implemented on 500 acres of land spread across 250 panchayats. The project will be executed in all local bodies in the coming three months. Saplings of indigenous trees and plants will be planted in fallow land and vacant spots available in public places as part of the scheme.

The land will be identified by local bodies. The land owned by government departments and institutions, poramboke land, vacant land in cities will be covered under this project. The project will be implemented with assistance from bio-diversity board, agriculture department, employment guarantee scheme, social forestry wing of forest department, environmental organisations, experts in bio-diversity field and people's representatives.

District-level technical committees will provide help in finding seed types and identification of trees. Green spaces will be made in places with a minimum of half cents of land to far larger acreage.

According to organisers, the project will help mitigate the effects of global warming and will function as carbon sinks by absorbing additional carbon present in the atmosphere.

NAGPUR: Government Polytechnic Nagpur would be awarding 711 diploma and 49 medals and prizes during its 22nd convocation on Thursday on its premises at 11am.

Diploma in civil engineering student Pratik Wankhede bagged the highest number of seven medals and prizes thus topping among all the 12 branches from the 2018-19 batch.

Officiating principal, Deepak Kulkarni , said of the 711 students, 116 were placed during the campus recruitment drive as 85% opted for further studies. “Though it is difficult to track each and every student, the general observation is that students go for bachelor’s degree in engineering as we could spot several names in the admission list of the directorate of technical education,” he said.

Kulkarni also said this would be the first time in the institution’s history that the joint director of Amravati would preside over the ceremony in the absence of full-time joint director from Nagpur region. “Amravati joint director DV Jadhav would grace the ceremony while Nagpur’s acting joint director Ram Nibudey will be present as a special guest,” he said.

Arving Kumar, centre head, TCS at Mihan, will be the chief guest.

The topper Pratik secured 95.3% marks and will receive six sponsored awards beside a gold medal instituted by the polytechnic. Total 28 awards are sponsored by academicians, industry persons and professionals for the meritorious students. While the institute will confer 21 gold, silver and bronze medals, 28 sponsored awards will be distributed among the same medallists. The institute has also started awarding cash prizes to toppers.

The polytechnic offers diploma in civil, electrical, mechanical, electronics and telecommunication, information technology, computer, textile manufacture, mine and mine surveying, metallurgical, automobile, travel and tourism, and packaging technology engineering.

Of the 12 branches, the above first nine were accredited by the National Board of Accreditation (NBA) this year.

“This resulted in the institution getting ministry of human resource and development and AICTE fundings for different skill-based and learning programmes for faculty and students,” he said.

The institute received around Rs14.5lakh fundings for four initiatives one of which - an international conference.

Currently, the institute has 2376 students on the roll.

Civil engineering department head NV Raut, who is in charge of the convocation, and controller of examinations MS Deshpande were present.

Photo for representative purpose only

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: While finance minister Thomas Isaac has set a target of complete cleanliness for 500 panchayats and 50 towns in 2020-21, nearly half the funds the state received from the Centre under the Swachh Bharat Mission (urban) (SBM (U)) remained unspent between 2015-16 and 2019-20, as per data obtained through an RTI query.

Over the five fiscals, the state received Rs 97 crore under SBM (U). Of this, it spent Rs 50.21 crore, leaving Rs 46.96 crore unutilized. According to officials with the state local self-government department, even the sum of Rs 50.21 crore cannot be classified as expenditure as it was allotted to local bodies by the Suchitwa Mission. The actual expenditure of each local body could be far less than the original allocation, they said.

As per the data, Suchitwa Mission allocated Rs 37.38 crore to 57 urban local bodies in the state for solid waste management and the ground-level implementation of these projects is yet to be ascertained. Data regarding usage of funds under SBM (rural) revealed that panchayats in the state have spent Rs 42 crore on solid waste management since 2015-16. Even so, between Rs 7 crore and Rs 22 crore remained unspent every fiscal, it showed.

SBM was launched by the Centre with two objectives: to attain open-defecation-free status and to ensure 100% scientific processing of solid waste being generated in the country. Isaac in his budget speech laid down specific criteria to realize his cleanliness target focusing on source-level waste management.

Even with its record of poor allocation of central funds, the state budget allocated nearly Rs 100 crore for sanitation and waste management under heads like Suchitwa Keralam, Suchitwa Keralam for urban areas, state share for SBM and the like.

The budget set apart Rs 35 crore as 40% of the state’s share for SBM in 2020-21 and another Rs 35 crore for the Suchitwa Keralam scheme with 12 components. Furthermore, Rs 22.33 crore has been budgeted for Suchitwa Keralam - a waste-management scheme for urban areas with 15 components. Officials point out that the strict insistence on utilization certificates could go a long way in ensuring proper on-the-ground expenditure. Earlier data obtained through RTI showed that between 2010 and 2014, only 75 panchayats in the state had submitted utilization certificates. Even among municipalities, the performance has been below par with only 14 producing utilization certificates for the amount received from the Suchitwa Mission.

176,['12/02/2020'],Water bodies vanishing fast as encroachers have free run,"This story is from February 12, 2020

Visakhapatnam: Vigilance by officials of the district administration has failed to prevent encroachment on water bodies in the city and Agency areas in Visakhapatnam district.

Water bodies in and around the city have shrunk over the past months as concrete structures have come up, often overnight. The catchment area of the Mudasarlova reservoir is worst affected. Ponds in and around the residential area of Madhurawada have also been encroached upon while a water fountain was built over a pond inside Shivaji Park.

A senior official at the office of the district collector said, “Filling up water bodies or encroaching upon them is not a new trend in the district, and especially in Visakhapatnam city and its outskirts. At present, the city is left with barely five or six water bodies. These have also shrunk to a large extent.”

Joint district collector L Shiva Shankar said the district collector has started to maintain vigil on encroachments over the past months and initiated a drive against some structures. “We have removed some illegal structures in Golugonda mandal under Narsipatnam division,” Shiva Shankar said.

District officials said despite removal of illegal structures, there have been cases where new structures were erected months after the administration removed them.

Claiming that locals and government agencies are also behind filling land, an official at the collector’s office said, “Many government agencies are also responsible for such acts. Also, be it realtors or individuals, whoever is behind illegal encroachments, is politically connected.”

At present, the Greater Visakhapatnam Municipal Corporation (GVMC) is most-affected by encroachments on water bodies. As lakes and ponds in the city shrink in size, the civic body has to tackle the problem of supplying drinking water to households under its limits, especially during the summer.

“Thankfully, we have restored the pond at Yandada crossing on National Highway (NH)-16, even though the size of the pond had reduced considerably. Now, with new residential complexes coming up in the locality, we are facing a challenge to maintain adequate water supply. This area will be further congested in future,” said an official at the GVMC’s water supply department.

177,['12/02/2020'],Thieves lifting bikes in Hubballi-Dharwad for a joyride?,"This story is from February 12, 2020

Hubballi: Police patrol parties in the twin cities are faced with a strange trend: motorbikes, evidently stolen, are cropping up on road sides with empty fuel tanks but little else out of order. Spare parts are intact and number plates not tampered with either.

“We regularly nab bike lifters but they usually sell the vehicles soon after the theft or dismantle them and sell the parts,” said an officer. “But now, the thieves are apparently taking the bikes for a joyride and abandoning them then and there once the fuel runs out.”

Old Hubballi police said they find four or five abandoned vehicles every month while patrolling, especially near Gabbur Cross and towards Karwar road bridge. “Our policemen bring these vehicles to the station and proper documentation is done and FIR is filed. The owner will have to get the vehicle released through court orders,” said an Old Hubballi station officer. Bike owners, however, register complaints only as a last resort, say cops.

In 2018, 177 cases of bike theft were registered while in 2019, 127 cases were registered. Police commissioner R Dileep said there has been a dip in bike thefts and cops were doing their best to crack down on the offenders. “Bikes are being abandoned and it is suspected that thieves are lifting the vehicles just to get a joyride out of them but we need to examine all the available data to verify this. I have asked officers to gather details of all the bikes found; only then can we determine the reasons,” he said.

Patrol teams said they often received calls from locals drawing attention to bikes parked on the roadsides for days together. Once a bike is retrieved, cops do try to share information with other police stations to verify if it has been reported stolen.

APMC/Navanagar police said they too found several abandoned bikes in their station limits. “We found that these bike lifters were not looking to make money from the theft since the parts are all intact. We suspect they were just taking the bike for a spin,” an officer said.

Suburban police said they had recently arrested a habitual offender, Psycho Manju alias Manjunath of Vaddar Oni, who stole one bike after the other and abandoned them once the petrol ran out. “We believe a similar trend is picking up. Perhaps, youngsters are doing it for the thrill,” an officer said.

Commissioner Dileep said vehicle owners must be extra careful. “I request the bike riders to properly lock their vehicles while parking, use additional locks apart from the handle lock. They should use designated parking lots. In case of theft, they must report it immediately to the nearest station. If police do not register a case, they can contact me directly,” he said.

The police commissioner said they have no data on how many bikes were traced and how many have been handed over to owners. Once the FIR is registered, the owner has to get the vehicle through a court order, said an officer.

In majority of the cases, owners search for the bikes for months and approach police as a last resort. Police register a case after waiting for a month or two.

Rajkot: The jeweller who was allegedly kidnapped on Sunday night from Wadhwan town of Surendranagar, was released by the abductors late on Monday night.

However, the cops investigating the kidnapping of Shailesh Mandalia, suspect something fishing in the entire episode as the jeweller was not able to give them satisfactory answers to queries on how he was kidnapped.

Meanwhile, the police have identified three accused — Tanvirsinh Zala, Rajdeepsinh Zala and Navdeep Sinh, who are yet to be arrested. They are probing whether the jeweller has cooking up his own kidnapping story or was he genuinely abducted.

According to police, they had received call from Mandalia’s family members that he was kidnapped in a Swift car from near Bhaktinandan circle in Wadhvan on Sunday night.

In protest, the Soni Bazar (jewellers’ market) in Wadhwan too remained closed on Monday demanding release of Mandalia. The police on Monday had found the car in which Mandalia was allegedly abducted, abandoned.

Police said that the alleged kidnappers on Monday late night called up the B division police station and told that they have released Mandalia near Limdi circuit house.

The police escorted Mandalia to his house and was called him to the police station for questioning on Tuesday morning.

Talking to TOI, police inspector of local crime branch Deepak Dhol said. “There are many unanswered questions in the case. The victim did not even have a minor injury. The story seems suspicious as the area from where he is said to have been kidnapped was a public place. There was not witness to the crime and nobody seem to have heard Mandalia’s screams for help.”

Mandalia told cops that he had verbal altercation with the kidnappers over a small accident following which he got kidnapped.

Muzaffarnagar: Five men, including two journalists, have been booked for creating ‘public nuisance’ during anti- Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and anti-National Register of Citizens (NRC) protests, which is being staged by women in Deoband, Saharanpur, for the past few weeks.

The FIR was registered on February 2, but the matter to came to light on late Monday evening when a local journalist went to Deoband police station during an official visit.

The Press Association Deoband met sub district magistrate (SDM) Rakesh Kumar earlier in the day and handed over a memorandum, addressing it to the President of India.

Manoj Singhal, the president of the Press Association, said, “We will launch a massive agitation if cases against two journalists are not taken back within three days”.

When asked about the rationale behind booking two journalists, additional superintendent of police (rural) Vidya Sagar Mishra said, “A case has been registered into the matter and the probe is underway. We will take action accordingly.”

Meanwhile, the two journalists, who were booked by the police, expressed shock over the police's decision.

Speaking to TOI, Musharraf Usmani, who is working with a leading Hindi newspaper, said, “It’s nothing but an attempt to impose pressure on the protesters. Just because my two sisters—Amna Roshi and Fozia—are leading the protest, the police have booked me in a false case.”

Another journalist Faheem Usmani said, “The protest is being held by the women. Why have the police booked us? We were there covering the protest, which is part of our job.”

Among those booked include Haider Ali, the son of former chairman of Deoband, and two other men, Firoz and Shoib. They have been booked under sections 269 (negligent act likely to spread infection of disease dangerous to life), 270 (malignant act likely to spread infection of disease dangerous to life), 278 (making atmosphere noxious to health), 290 (punishment for public nuisance) of the Indian Penal Code.

Notably, hundreds of women have been staging protest against the CAA and proposed NRC for the past few weeks. The protesters also marched to Eidgah grounds on January 27 evening and held a dharna on Eidgah, which is still on.

Gandhinagar: With an eye on the state-wide taluka and district panchayat elections scheduled later this year, the state government plans to provide power supply to farmers during daytime. Farmers are currently being supplied electricity only during night hours to irrigate their fields.

Farmers who opt to promote use of solar power under Pradhan Mantri Kisan Urja Suraksha evam Utthaan Mahabhiyan (PM-KUSUM) scheme will be eligible to receive electricity for irrigating their fields during the day hours.

Farmers have been demanding for the past several years, that they should be provided electricity during the day. They contend that they have to face risks like snake bites, wild animal attacks and other injuries, as they are forced to irrigate their fields in the dark. More than 50 lakh farmers in the state get power supply during the night hours for agricultural purposes.

Key sources in the government said that the demand of farmers was discussed at length in the last cabinet meeting even as the energy and petrochemicals department made a detailed presentation on the power demand and supply status. “A daily consumption of around 6,000MW of power is being reported by farmers during night hours. There is a need to enhance installed capacity considerably if farmers have to be provided power during the day,” the official said.

The official added that the state government decided to close down the SKY (Suryashakti Kisan Yojna) as it has failed to generate expected results. Instead, the government has decided to promote use of solar power by farmers under Pradhan Mantri Kisan Urja Suraksha evam Utthaan Mahabhiyan (PM-KUSUM) scheme only.

“Both the schemes are more or less the same, but farmers are getting better benefits under KUSUM scheme, so we decided to drop the SKY scheme. Under the new scheme, farmers may not even have to pay their 10% share to avail the scheme benefit. The farmers will get daytime power use permission under the KUSUM scheme,” the official said.

Video grab of lions moving in the backdrop of containers on Tuesday

Rajkot: Workers at Port Pipavav , managed by APM Terminals , are a scared lot these days.

While lions are frequently spotted on the road towards the port, the wild cats are now seen strolling around the jetty and railway yard where big containers are stacked.

Videos of a pride of at least four lions moving in the backdrop of containers went viral on the social media on Tuesday. Sources said that the same pride was spotted near the jetty area a couple of days ago.

Wildlife experts say the movement of lions so close to containers and railway line poses a big risk for injury to them. Moreover, a threat of attack on people working there also looms in the event of someone harassing them.

Lions have often halted movement of trucks several times on the road leading to Port Pipavav.

Sources said that large number of lions live in revenue areas (non-protected) in Rajula taluka where the port is located. Recently, a lioness had dragged away and killed a five-year-old boy in Uchhaiya village, barely three km from the port. The lioness had also eaten parts of his body.

A sugar mill in Pilibhit

MEERUT: With sugar production at 54.96 lakh tons this crushing season (as of January 31), Uttar Pradesh has topped the charts in the country, trouncing Maharashtra , according to the data provided by Indian Sugar Mill Association (ISMA).

In all 446 sugar mills in the country have produced 141.12 lakh tons of sugar out of which 119 sugar mills in UP produced 54.96 lakh tons, followed by 34.54 lakh tons by 143 sugar mills in Maharashtra. Notably, Maharashtra had topped production last year with 70.99 lakh tons as on January 31 as compared to UP, which yielded only 52.86 lakh tons of sugar. This year, all states except UP have exhibited a slowdown in sugar production in 2019-2020.

Besides Maharashtra, sugar production also declined in states like Karnataka and Tamil Nadu till January 31. Karnataka’s 63 mills produced 27.94 lakh tons as against 33.76 lakh tons produced by 66 sugar mills last year in the same period. Similarly, Tamil Nadu that has 21 mills produced 2.05 lakh tons of sugar as compared to 2.86 in the corresponding period last year.

ISMA attributed the fall in sugar production in Maharashtra and Karnataka to decline in area under cane cultivation. In 2018, cane production was hurt by drought that forced farmers to curb cane planting, while flooding damaged crops in key growing regions in 2019 in these states. In fact, Maharashtra’s cane area has gone down by about 30% for 2019-20.

Based on satellite images taken in the latter part of June 2019, ISMA estimated cane area in UP at 23.60 lakh hectares, a marginal decrease of 2% from 2018. Thereby, sugar production for 2019-20 is estimated at 120 lakh tons.

Replacement by high yielding cane varieties in parts of UP in 2019 also led to an improvement in yield and sugar extraction, ISMA sources said.

UP cane minister Suresh Rana told TOI, “We expect production of 120 lakh tons of sugar this crushing season. The recovery rate is also above 11%, which is phenomenal.”

Uttar Pradesh Sugar Mill Association (UPSMA) general secretary Deepak Guptara said, “Among various factors that contributed to the better yield is the cultivation of ‘Wonder Variety 238’, which has a higher yield in terms of crop harvest as well as results in higher percentage of sugar content.”

According to sources in ISMA, “Sugar production estimated for 2019-20 crushing season is 260 lakh tons, which will be around 70 lakh tons less than the production in the last season. This means that countrywide there may be a 22% dip in sugar production for 2019-20 crushing season.”

BIJNOR: A jawan of the Indo-Tibetan Border Police (ITBP) — originally posted in Assam — who was at his home in Bijnor on leave, was arrested by Bijnor police along with three accomplices, for allegedly looting Rs 20,000, a bike and a cell phone from a liquor shop salesman. According to police, the jawan had carried out the crime to spend on a party with friends.

The incident occurred in Bijnor’s Kotwali Dehat area on December 29, when Sunil Kumar of Bhaneda village under Kiratpur police station, was returning home from Bundaki sugar mill. He was waylaid by the accused, who grabbed his bike, phone and cash. Interestingly, jawan was riding a high-end KTM bike issued by ITBP that costs around Rs 2 lakh, when he looted the salesman. Police have recovered Rs 8,530 out of the looted cash and the mobile phone, and seized the jawan’s bike.

Meerut: A day after authorities of a private school in Saharanpur announced suspension of a teacher for her anti-CAA remark in Delhi’s Shaheen Bagh, local police and administration swung into action on Tuesday and said the principal of the school gave the suspension order under duress, and she was still on their rolls.

“Just explanation has been sought by the school,” a senior police officer said, putting to rest the controversy surrounding the suspension of Nahid Zaidi.

A group led by local saffron leaders held a protest at the private school on Monday forcing the authorities to suspend the 40-year-old educator. Another teacher, who was with Nahid Zaidi, is also facing a probe for her remarks at another school.

Superintendent of police (city) of Saharanpur Vineet Bhatnagar said, “The crowd gathered at the school flustered the principal, who wrongly said to have suspended the teacher. Only an explanation was sought over her remarks where she claimed that demeaning comments were passed by colleagues at school.""

Meanwhile, Zaidi maintained that a portion of the video clip of her interaction with the local media in Delhi was circulated on social media and was later used to criticize and troll her.

“An old video of mine is being made viral and is drawing unsolicited reactions on social media. The video was shot on January 19 during my visit to Shaheen Bagh. The edited video is being misused to troll and instigate others against me,” Zaidi said, adding, “The remark I made was in the context of protest at Shaheen Bagh and might not hold true for my city. I have no difference with my school authorities and neither have they suspended or terminated me.”

The mobilisation had begun on social media when a few locals identified the teachers and began demanding strict action.

“The video was widely shared on social media. A roadmap was drawn and we reached out to locals and parents of wards studying in the school and we finally decided to meet at around 11am on Monday on Court Road. From there, we went to schools where we spoke to the principal,” Rahul Jhamb, a local activist, said.

The average kesar mango production of three regions of Gir area is nearly 2 lakh metric tonne per season

RAJKOT: Bad news , kesar mango lovers. Your wait to taste the delicious mangoes got a little longer this year. The crop is expected to be delayed by two months because of the extended monsoon last year.

Again, mango farmers fear that sudden rise in temperature may adversely affect yield, though they hipe to go to the market mid may with the king of fruits. However, in many farms it is still at the flowering stage.

There are three major districts – Gir Somnath, Junagadh and Amreli – well known for Saurashtra’s kesar mango production . Generally, buds appear in the first week of February and by mid-February, markets start selling raw mangoes, used for pickling, preservation purposes or for general daily consumption.

Jayesh Hirpara, a kesar mango farmer in Jamvada Gir area of Talala in Junagadh district said, “Generally the flowering period for mango is 45 to 50 days. But this time it has extended to almost 70 days. A few farmers have accused last year’s anthracnose disease to the delay this year. Buds require low temperature and if temperatures increase suddenly, it will badly affect our crop.”

Professor D K Varu head of department of fruit science in Junagadh Agriculture university (JAU) said that the extended monsoon has delayed the entire crop pattern. Mango has been delayed by nearly 45 days this season, he said. The current temperature is favourable for mango budding, but if there is high fluctuation between day and night temperatures, it will affect setting of fruits, he said, adding that cloudy atmosphere even once in a week will result in fungal diseases in the fruits.

Ukka Bhatti, who owns a mango orchard in Hitla village of Dhari taluka in Amreli district said that winter is the most suitable for pollination. “This year because of delayed crop we fear less yield. The average kesar mango production of three regions of Gir area is nearly 2 lakh metric tonne per season,” he added.

Meerut: The Uttar Pradesh government has instructed for the inspection of 25 schools in each district on a random basis to check whether the Prerna App is being used properly for geo-tagging and uploading pictures.

The Prerna app was recently launched to keep a check on the government facilities being provided at the ground level, including mid-day meal, school uniforms, furniture and others.

Under the Prerna app initiative, the teachers are instructed to upload pictures of the schools and the facilities so that the state government authorities can stay updated.

These details mainly included uploading the pictures and geo-tagging of schools under a defined protocol,” said the order issued by Vijay Kiran Anand, UP state project director.

Apart from geo-tagging and uploading pictures, more data was sought from the schools in a prescribed format. “In this backdrop, nearly 25 schools from each district – out of those which have completed two stages of inspection already – should be inspected for the new details sought and see that all the data is in place,” the order stated.

MEERUT: With two swine flu deaths and rise in number of patients testing positive, which reached 21 on Tuesday, the Meerut health department is on its toes and has started spreading awareness about the H1N1 virus.

Doctors say one should cover his or her face with a handkerchief while sneezing/coughing, and keep the hands clean by repeatedly washing them with soap. The flu spreads from person to person, either by inhaling the virus or by touching surfaces contaminated with the virus, then touching the mouth or nose. Fever, cold, cough and vomiting are common symptoms of this variant of flu, which may prove fatal if not attended to on time. Therefore, one must consult a doctor as soon as possible.

“On Tuesday, four new cases of swine flu were reported – raising the total number of cases to 21. Two deaths have also been reported. The health department is on its toes and is spreading awareness about the disease. We urge people to maintain cleanliness so that the infection doesn’t spread as easily,” said Dr Rachna Tandon, Meerut district epidemiologist.

Children below five years of age, the elderly, especially above 65 years old, pregnant women and people with prolonged respiratory disease fall in the high risk group patients and should exercise more caution.

Private hospitals have been asked to set up isolation wards for patients of swine flu to ensure that other patients or hospital staff are not infected.

In areas where swine flu cases have been detected, surveillance is being conducted to check if there are more cases in proximity. Awareness camps are also being organized there so that people in those areas can exercise caution. Also, epidemiological study and travel history of patients is being checked, the health department authorities said.

“The four new patients are a 64-year-old man from New Prabhat Nagar, a 63-year-old woman from Budhana Gate, a six-year-old girl and a 40-year-old woman from Ganga Nagar. All of them have been given medicines and have been asked to exercise caution,” said Dr Raj Kumar, Meerut chief medical officer.

Doctors have advised that only one member of the family should engage in taking care of a swine flu patient to prevent everyone from getting infected. One should wash hands frequently, wear a mask when in the vicinity of the patient, take care of cleanliness inside the patient’s room and use separate utensils for the patient, doctors said.

HYDERABAD: Shared mobility player Uber on Tuesday announced the setting up of its first Uber Money team for the Asia Pacific region at its Hyderabad tech centre. The team, comprising over 100 technology professionals, will be responsible for global financial products and technology innovations for Uber. Apart from Hyderabad, the Uber Money team also has a presence at its San Francisco, Palo Alto, New York and Amsterdam tech centers.

The company said the Hyderabad-based team will play an essential role in enabling upcoming new global features and improvements, including real-time earnings, updated debit accounts and debit cards for Uber drivers along with Uber Wallet and refreshed Uber credit card for Uber riders.

The expansion is in line with Uber’s CEO Dara Khosrowshahi’s pledge to remain committed to India. During his October 2019 visit, he had said Uber aims to double down on long-term growth at its Hyderabad and Bangalore tech centers.

The Uber Money team, which comes with deep knowledge in front-end, full-stack, mobile, machine learning, and data engineering, will focus on implementing new payment methods, enabling and building financial compliance tools, leveraging smart routing technologies for payment gateways, and applying Uber Artificial Intelligence models for intelligent risk decisions, Uber said in a release.

Commenting on the development, Naga Kasu, engineering director and Hyderabad site lead, Uber said, “The Uber Hyderabad tech centre has the best in class fintech talent specializing in risk, payments, financial reporting and analytics platform engineering. Besides engineering, we are investing in growing and scaling data science, analytics, and product management organizations to transform Hyderabad into a full spectrum tech site for Uber.”

Uber’s Hyderabad Engineering Centre, which was flagged off in 2014, has a headcount of over 250 engineers. The centre builds software products and platforms focusing on providing a seamless experience to Uber’s global community. The total engineering headcount in India stands at over 500. Globally, Uber has over 27,000 employees.

The Hyderabad centre’s cutting-edge innovations and ability to generate high business impact have resulted in greater investments, increased hiring, and more responsibility for the site, Uber said.

The ones in the internal colonies are being fixed and the work is expected to be completed this week. The potholes in the other areas will also be fixed and work is in progress.”

“We are receiving complaints from people through the grievance redressal mechanism ‘Spandana’ and we are taking up works in a phased manner after they are sanctioned,” added the superintendent engineer.

198,['12/02/2020'],FIGHT TILL THE FINISH,"This story is from February 12, 2020

Panaji: Clifford Miranda was away in Germany, interning with RB Leipzig for his Pro Licence coaching course, when all hell broke loose in Goa with the sacking of FC Goa coach Sergio Lobera. There was mayhem on social media with several conspiracy theories, journalists joined the protesting bandwagon too, and while players stayed mum, you could sense there was tension in the air.

Clifford returned to be named interim coach for the rest of the season with Derrick Pereira as technical director, and what he saw in the dressing room was, by his own admission, exactly the same he saw three weeks ago when he packed his bags for Germany.

“When I returned, I could see a normal mood. Normal for us is positive. When I arrived, I could see no difference. Whatever negativity, whatever things are happening inside or around the club, whatever pressure, it’s external. It’s not in the dressing room. The players are in good spirits, raring to go with one aim and that is to finish on top,” said Clifford on Tuesday.

The mood in the dressing room is crucial for Goa’s success at least in the remaining two league games as they chase the top spot and a place in the AFC Champions League, a first for any Indian club. While there may have been some negativity ahead of the last game against Hyderabad FC – which Goa won comfortably – a sense of calm should hold the hosts in good stead as they face Mumbai City FC at the Nehru Stadium in Fatorda on Wednesday.

Goa are tied on points at the top with ATK, but the Kolkata club’s head-to-head advantage means they have to count upon their rivals dropping points to finish on top.

Many believe ATK could stumble in one of their two fixtures — both of which are tricky against the likes of Chennaiyin FC and Bengaluru FC -- and Clifford wants to ensure that they have left nothing to chance.

“For us the equation is simple, win two games and see what happens with ATK. It is their title to lose. The pressure is on them,” said the former India midfielder.

Mumbai are chasing the fourth playoff spot, and given that the have accumulated 10 points from their last four games, Jorge Costa’s side will fancy their chances.

“We have two games till the end of the regular season and we need points to finish in the top four. This will be a difficult game against one of the best teams in the ISL, one team which is always difficult to play against,” said Costa.

Asked if this was a good time to play Goa, without Lobera to guide them, Costa simply smiled, before explaining why nothing has changed.

“They will change nothing. Goa are doing well from the beginning. Honestly, I think Goa doesn’t need to change. They are so good and playing so well, I don’t think they will change players in the first XI. Almost 100 percent, I can tell the first 11 of Goa (against Mumbai), I can tell you how they will play. Only thing I cannot tell is the final result,” said Costa.

199,['12/02/2020'],ACB starts inquiry into learners’ licence scam,"This story is from February 12, 2020

NAGPUR: Almost two years after lodging a complaint, transport commissioner (TC) Shekhar Channe has given nod to state’s anti-corruption bureau (ACB) for inquiry against its officials, including motor vehicle inspectors (MVIs) and assistant motor vehicle inspectors (AMVIs), allegedly involved in learners’ licence scam.

Office of superintendent of police (ACB) Rashmi Nandedkar confirmed the development and stated that an open inquiry has been initiated against nine city RTO officials including four MVIs.

The case had come to fore after activist Nitin Tiwari exposed irregularities in 2018 in conducting learners’ licence test in city RTO situated in Giripeth. He later lodged a complaint with cyber cell of Nagpur city police. The cyber cell had conducted probe and found evidence of the alleged scam.

During the inquiry it was revealed that apart from office computers, outside IP addresses were used to conduct the tests and involvement of 17 persons was established. The cyber cell had submitted 1,800-page report to transport commissioner’s office in Mumbai in early 2019.

Though the cyber cell had completed its investigation, departmental inquiry ordered by transport commissioner into the case is still not completed.

Tiwari also filed a PIL in the high court. On September 21 last year, following nod from the TC, an FIR against 17 persons, including nine RTO officials and eight outsiders, was registered at Sitabuldi police station.

The police booked MVIs Abhijeet Khare and Vilas Thengne, AMVIs Mangesh Rathore, Sanjivani Chopde, Shailesh Kopulla, Sanjay Pallewad , Mithun Dongre , and two clerks — retired office superintendent Pradip Lehgaonkar and Deepali Bhoyar — and eight outsiders Ashwin Sawarkar, Rajesh Deshmukh , Ashish Bhoyar, Arun Lanjewar, Umesh Dhivdonde, Amol Pantawane, owner of Orange Infotech Pvt Ltd Jairam D’Souza and one of his employees under sections 419, 420, 464, 465, 468, 471 of Indian Penal Code along with Section 66 (C)&(D) of Information Technology Act.

Though 17 persons were booked in the scam, the Economic Offences Wing (EOW) has so far arrested only one AMVI Sanjivani Chopde and three agents Sawarkar, Pantawane and Bhoyar, and they were released on surety bonds.

A senior ACB official said the inquiry will be completed within six months and appropriate action will be taken against those found involved in the scam.

Sources said as a case has been registered, its investigation should have been handed over to the ACB much earlier as RTO officials were allegedly involved in corrupt practices like demanding and accepting bribes.

200,['12/02/2020'],GVMC plans 3 pipelines to avert water scarcity in city’s suburbs,"This story is from February 12, 2020

Visakhapatnam: The Greater Visakhapatnam Municipal Corporation ( GVMC ) has taken up a project to lay three new water pipelines to augment water supply in the suburbs of the city at a cost of around Rs 120 crore. The proposed length of the pipelines is about 40-45 kilometres.

Areas such as Anakapalle, Koppaka, Sirasapalli, Duvvada, Kapu Jaggarajupeta, Narava, Arilova, Hanumanthawaka, Madhurawada and Kommadi will benefit from the project.

Anakapalle and its surroundings, which are dependent on the Sarada river for drinking water, will also get treated water from the 85 MLD water treatment plant in Aganampudi through a pipeline.

A gravity main—a building drainage system that drains by gravity—will be laid from the Aganampudi balancing reservoir to Narava water sump and is expected to improve water supply in Duvvada, Kapu Jaggarajupeta and Narava.

A gravity main will be designed from Padmanabhapuram balancing reservoir in Vepagunta to Mudasarlova and its surroundings via Simhachalam. The Mudasarlova reservoir, near the Health City in Arilova, dries up during summer. If the area is connected to the Padmanabhapuram reservoir, the GVMC can supply water in summer. The civic body is also exploring the option of connecting the pipeline directly with the Mudasarlova reservoir to maintain optimum levels in the reservoir.

An official at the GVMC water supply wing said they are in the process of preparing a detailed project report of the new pipelines. “The report will cover population aspect, water resource availability, quality and sustainability to serve the demands for the horizon year and water source improvement,” said the official.

The GVMC has planned the pipelines to take advantage of water drawls from the Yeleru. At present, the GVMC can draw about 120 millions of gallons per day (MGD) of water through the Yeleru canal in summer, as against 60-70 MGD in previous years. The Purushothapatnam lift irrigation scheme has allowed the Yeleru reservoir to reach its full capacity in the last two years.

The GVMC earlier completed interlinking works between the Sundarayya Colony treatment plant (where the water source is Yeleru) to the Mindi treatment plant (where the water source is Meghadrigedda reservoir). The area, which receives water from Meghadrigedda and faces water shortage due to low levels in the reservoir in summer, can now receive water from Yeleru.

In Nathayyapalem, the GVMC has laid a connection to divert about 8 MGD from Yeleru/Godavari through old Raiwada pumping main to Nathayyapalem instead of pumping water to the area from Meghadrigedda. The GVMC took up repairs on the old Raiwada pumping main in 2018, which helped it divert excess water to various reservoirs in the city and avoid a water crisis in 2019.

201,['12/02/2020'],GPS beat Alembic school by 112 runs in opener,"This story is from February 12, 2020

Naivedhya Jain gets his man of the match trophy at Alembic School grounds on Tuesday

Vadodara: Middle-order batsman Naivedhya Jain’s maiden century helped Gujarat Public School (GPS) defeat Alembic boys by 112 runs in the opening match of Maharani Shantadevi Inter-School Tournament here on Tuesday.

GPS won the toss and was elected to bat first. Though the top order couldn’t survive for long, Jain, who walked in at the middle of the game changed its course. Jain scored 133 in 94 balls that included 17 boundaries and four sixes. He made a slow start but soon stepped up the scoring rate. GPS scored 272 runs with hard hitting Jain added 33 runs in the last two overs.

The target proved to be huge for Alembic boys who began their innings under pressure. The openers put together just 21 runs in the first six overs. Despite two dropped catches by GPS fielders, Alembic couldn’t take advantage of the poor fielding, where Jain again displayed his sharp fielding skills too. His brilliant catch dismissing Meet Shah of Alembic School was a highlight of the match.

After 30 overs, the required run-rate rose to 10 runs per over. Alembic skipper Krishu Panchal tried to salvage his team’s fate by scoring a brave 45-run knock but none of his team-mates could support him in the task. The last four batsmen got out for duck and Alembic boys was bundled out for 160 runs in 38 overs. Jain was adjudged man of the match.

Villagers from Palsana, Kamrej and Choriyasi gathere at Itwarva village in Palsana to attend a meeting on Tues... Read More

Surat: A 21-member committee has been formed on Tuesday by the farmers and cooperative leaders to launch agitation against the authorities of the Bhatia toll plaza demanding extra cash lanes and discount in the FASTag payment system for the vehicles registered in Surat city and district.

Scores of villagers from Palsana, Kamrej and Choriyasi gathered at Itwarva village in Palsana to attend a meeting convened by the farmers and cooperative leaders to protest against the authorities of Bhatia toll plaza. The villagers assured their support to the committee formed to launch the agitation.

Darshan Naik, member of Surat district panchayat told TOI, “They should provided relief to the local vehicles registered in the city and district from paying toll tax. However, vehicle owners are made to pay Rs 20 for one-way and that they have to stand in the long queues.”

According to Naik, the committee members will form a detailed programme to launch agitation in the next few days with the support of the villagers of nearby talukas. The agitation will be held in a peaceful manner without any violence, he added.

Jayesh Patel, president of Gujarat Khedut Samaj (GKS) said, “Farmers from nearby talukas in the district send their farm produces in the city. There are more than 1,500 such vehicles entering the city on daily basis. Since there is only one cash lane, the vehicles have to wait for their turn for more than an hour.”

Patel added, “We have been demanding at least two cash lanes and allowing passage of vehicles from the FASTag lanes by giving them 75% discount.”

Dhansukh Patel, cooperative leader and former BJP MLA from Olpaad said, “Daily 15,000 vehicles pass through the Bhatia toll plaza and majority of them are local vehicles. One can imagine the long queue at a single cash window at the booth. Despite repeated representations, the toll authorities have not increased cash lanes.”

When contacted, manager of Bhatia toll plaza, Rajshekhar Tiwari said, “As per the guideline of National High Authority of India (NHAI), we can keep only one cash lane after the implementation of FASTag rule. We have already given relief to the local vehicles by charging them Rs 20 for one-way fare instead of Rs 105.”

204,['12/02/2020'],West Bengal: This is how your journey through Salt Lake will be from Valentine's Day,"For now, it’s just a 5km truncated run in Salt Lake and a small stretch of EM Bypass

KOLKATA: On board East-West Metro , driver Dipak Kumar deftly pushes the start button on the control panel and the automated management system, which is controlling the train from the Central Park depot 2km away, takes over. The sleek, stainless steel BEML-make gently pulls out of Sector V station at 30kmph. A curvaceous viaduct in front of the Wipro crossing wouldn’t allow the six-coach car take its full 80kmph run. Grazing past the white, perforated sound barrier at DL block, the train is galloping towards the HSBC building.The air-conditioning inside the coach seems pleasant. Everything in the East-West Metro coach — from the AC to opening and closing of doors, broadcast announcements and digital displays to the CCTV inside the driver’s cabin integrated with real-time surveillance in the stations — is controlled by the communication-based train control (CBTC) system. The rakes can later be upgraded to driverless trains. When East-West Metro’s 16km corridor is complete, it will attain this driverless status.For now, it’s just a 5km truncated run in Salt Lake and a small stretch of EM Bypass. The first stop is Karunamoyee station. The doors, perfectly synchronized with the platform screen gates (PSGs) open smoothly. No one walks in. But the passenger address system (PAS) warns: ‘Please mind the gap’, echoing the famous phrase that was first introduced in the London Underground. Like in London, the floor of the platforms illustrates a visual warning as well, in warm red-yellow letters. The idea is to caution the commuter while crossing the gap between the train door and the station platform.The waiting time per station is 20 seconds, precisely. The PAS announces that we are leaving Karunamoyee and heading towards Central Park. The LED display board flashes the same message. The PSGs and the doors are shut by then. In no time, the train reaches Central Park station, which is the most attractive among the six East-West Metro stations. The train chugs past a huge terracotta mural, spread across 40m, themed on the evolution of the different modes of transport in Kolkata. Apart from being eminently decorated, Central Park is special because it’s the only single-floor East-West station where the concourse and the platform are on the same level. There are, in fact, three platforms here. The third is for the trains to enter from the depot, which is housed inside Salt Lake’s Central Park.The train then reaches City Centre, the smallest station, and starts zipping towards Bengal Chemical station, the fifth stop. The train slows considerably to negotiate another sharp turn at the Salt Lake-EM Bypass intersection, picking up speed as it moves past Apollo hospital and Mani Square. The dome of Salt Lake stadium surfaces the skyline on the left. It takes 13 minutes to reach the terminal Salt Lake Stadium station. As the train stops, the driver on the other end of the train takes charge for a ride back to Sector V.Commuters will be able to experience the ride on February 14, a day after railway minister Piyush Goyal unveils the section. After flagging off the first train, he would commute till City Centre station with VIPs and the media. Commercial services will start at 8am the next day.",kolkata,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74092999,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-250849,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/this-is-how-your-journey-through-salt-lake-will-be-from-v-day/articleshow/74089096.cms

KOZHIKODE: People residing in Kozhikode corporation limits will get the first roller skating rink at the park which will come up at Eranhipalam . A sum of Rs 60 lakh will be utilized for the construction work of the park.

The civic body has commenced the construction work of the rink to set up an exclusive place for skating in the corporation limits.

Considered to be the first-of-its-kind initiative in the entire district, the move aims to ensure an exclusive location in the corporation for skating and to practice yoga in a serene environment and to conduct workouts in the open space.

The construction work of the skating rink will be carried out under the development of green space including it under the union government aided Amrut scheme . The facility will be coming up on 80 cents of land at Eranhipalam. The civic body will also construct jogging track for the health enthusiasts. It will also set up changing rooms, separate toilet blocks for men and women, an open-air stage, snack corners, seating arrangements and children’s play area at the park. It will also plant medicinal and fruit bearing tree saplings to make it a serene place.

The civic body decided to construct the skating rink after observing an increase in the number of children arriving on the Kozhikode beach and Bhatt Road Beach to practice skating in early morning and evening hours. With the commissioning of the new skating rink, the skaters can practice at the new park. The civic body has levelled the area for the construction of skating rink and jogging track by making use of the mud removed at the time of construction of storm water drainage channel work in the corporation limits.

Eranhipalam ward councillor T C Bijuraj said that health-conscious people can make use of the park at Eranhipalam to practice rollerskating, jogging, walking and yoga. “The public can also make use of the open space to spend leisure time with their families and friends,” he said adding that 70% of the construction work of the park has already been completed.

206,['12/02/2020'],House clears bill on burial rights,"This story is from February 12, 2020

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: State assembly on Tuesday unanimously passed a bill which proposed to settle the row between Orthodox and Jacobite Christian denominations over the burial of persons from rival factions in the church cemetery owned by them.

As per the bill, members belonging to both the warring factions will have the right to bury bodies in cemeteries where their ancestors were buried. This right would be so irrespective of custodian of the cemeteries. In order to pre-empt any possible misinterpretations of the provisions incorporated in the bill, the government adopted major changes recommended by the opposition members and church heads.

In order to make it specifically clear that the bill would be applicable only to Jacobite and Orthodox denominations, the house gave unanimous permission to incorporate the names of the factions in the very name of the bill. Since the name of the factions were not mentioned in the name of the bill piloted in the house on February 6, it could create a false impression that the proposed act would be applicable to all denominations, members in the House had pointed out.

Parliamentary affairs minister A K Balan who presented the bill told the House that the government was forced to promulgate a bill in this regard as the disputes between the two church factions sprang up unpleasant situations and inhuman predicaments as at times warring churches having control over one or the other cemetery denied permission for the burial of bodies of persons not belonging to their respective denomination. “Government made attempts to resolve the issue through talks. But no such efforts in the official and ministerial level could cut the ice,” he said.

The discussion on the bill also led to the opposition leader Ramesh Chennithala and deputy leader M K Muneer voicing their concerns over the ‘unfounded’ criticism they faced in social media platforms for their dissent note to the bill. “It’s highly unfortunate that people who have no idea about the legislative business unleash baseless criticisms against us in connection with the bill. As we have already stated, we are not against the bill. We are not against the government promulgating bill for ensuring a decent burial of people belonging to both factions of the Christian church,” Chennitala said. M K Muneer said there were malicious campaigns in social media projecting that he had opposed the bill.

Speaker Sreeramakrishnan and ministers E P Jayarajan and A K Balan also shared the thoughts expressed by Chennithala and Muneer by saying that such ill-informed and malicious campaigns have become a nuisance.

208,['12/02/2020'],Drive to recover e-challans worth Rs 16 crore begins,"This story is from February 12, 2020

Vadodara: The city police department is looking to fill its coffers with huge amount of pending traffic penalties

The traffic offenders owe the police department Rs 16.24 crore towards penalties for various offences and the cops have now initiated a major drive to recover the these fines.

“Commuters have been fined on several counts and e-challans have been sent to their homes. But most of them haven’t paid the penalties. The amount is now running into crores of rupees, so we have decided to start a drive for recovering the dues,” said city police commissioner, Anupam Singh Gahlaut. Special desks have been set up by the police in 15 spots in different areas of the city to collect penalties.

Officials said that the help desks keep rotating among these areas including Mandvi, Sardar Estate, Dandia Bazaar Crossroads and Diwalipura. “The violators have been requested to visit the help desk and pay their challans. The desks have helped as we have been recovering Rs 2.5 lakh daily,” Gahlaut told TOI.

Over the last few months, the department has been collecting Rs 60 lakh to Rs 70 lakh per month.

Senior police officials said that many citizens have more than 15 e-challans pending against them. “We have started writing to the regional transport office (RTO) to suspend driving license of those who have more than 15 e-challans pending against them. As of now, we have asked the RTO to suspend licenses of 569 offenders. Citizens should pay the e-challan at the earliest,” Gahlaut said.

Some of the main areas where the CCTVs are being used to issue e-challans include Ambedkar Circle, Manisha Crossroads, Kalaghoda Circle, Mujmahuda Crossroads, L&T Circle, Amitnagar Circle, Rhino Circle, Natubhai Circle, Sangam Crossroads and Sama-Savli Checkpost.

The traffic cops also click photos of commuters flouting traffic rules on their mobile phones and then e-challans are issued based on the vehicle’s license plate number. Commuters can pay e-challans online, at the nearest police station or at the help desks.

The traffic police will be focussing on penalizing commuters talking on phone while driving vehicles and those not jumping the stop line at traffic signals. Another priority would be fine people for parking vehicles in no-parking zones and not installing HSRP number plate.

Saligao: Congress’ North Goa district committee has raised concerns over the dumping of debris on the Peddem side of the Bastora-Mapusa flyover. The party has also accused the authorities of turning a blind eye to those responsible for the dumping.

North Goa district Congress committee president Vijay Bhike said that the debris is not just mud, but also includes dry and wet garbage. “The flow of water from a sluice gate which irrigates fields on the opposite side of the flyover is blocked due to the debris dumped,” he said.

Bhike said that he complained to the Mapusa Municipal Council chief officer, who in turn wrote to deputy collector Akshay Potekar, who in turn directed the town and country planning department (TCP) to take necessary action—but nothing has been done till date. “The dumping continues unabated. The flying squad should have acted on the matter and seized the trucks dumping debris,” said Bhike.

210,['12/02/2020'],Solar players urge MERC to scrap GSC,"This story is from February 12, 2020

NAGPUR: A large number of solar equipment suppliers and manufacturers have urged Maharashtra Electricity Regulatory Commission (MERC) to scrap grid support charge (GSC) proposed by MSEDCL on solar rooftop consumers.

Vanamati hall, where the commission held a public hearing on MSEDCL’s power tariff hike petition, was jam-packed on Tuesday and most of the consumers were solar players.

The Maharashtra State Electricity Distribution Company Ltd (MSEDCL) has proposed astronomical GSC, which if approved by the MERC, will make solar power costlier than the discom power. The MSEDCL wants to scuttle solar rooftop, which is against central government’s policy to increase renewable energy generation.

Solar expert Ajit Ganguly , appearing on behalf of Confederation of Real Estate Developers Association of India (Credai), said that MSEDCL had arbitrarily proposed GSC on various categories of consumers ranging from Rs2.06 per unit to Rs10.49 per unit. For residential category customer, the GSC ranges from Rs4.04 per unit to Rs8.66 per unit for the year 2020-21. Such exorbitant charges will kill the nascent solar rooftop industry and will defeat the aim and policy of the central government.

The GSC will push average cost of electricity for a consumer in the range of Rs11-Rs14 per unit which is higher than the tariff proposed by the discom.

Ganguly also questioned the power purchase expenses of MSEDCL. He pointed out that there was almost Rs3,100 crore jump in the power purchase from Adani Power, while the quantum of energy purchase is only 989 million units (MU). This translates into each additional unit purchased at Rs31. MSEDCL wants to purchase 42 MU less from Emco, but the power purchase cost has gone up by Rs170 crore, he said.

Sudhir Budhey of Maharashtra Solar Manufacturers Association (Masma) said that there should not be any charge on the energy produced by solar rooftop consumers for it being captive power plants. The proposals of GSC and additional fixed charges by MSEDCL are totally against the Electricity Act, 2003. Nowhere in the country had the regulatory commission imposed GSC, he pointed out.

Mahendra Jichkar pointed out that there was a huge difference in bills of residential users consuming 100 units per month and those using 200 units. The monthly bill in the first case would be Rs433, while in the second it would be Rs1,256. He compared the rates with other states for 200 units: Chhattisgarh Rs210, Goa Rs350, Gujarat Rs743 and Telangana Rs760.

Jichkar pointed out with the help of figures that high consumption commercial consumers were being spared while steep tariff hike was being imposed on small commercial establishments.

TimesView Commuter dispersal can be be an unexpected bottleneck if plans are not drawn up on how to tackle the issue. Initial footfalls may not be so much of a problem because of the truncated service but it is better to plan ahead.

KOLKATA: Metro Railway is tying up with Kolkata Police to boost last-mile connectivity around the about-to-be commissioned East-West Metro stations. It will share passenger footfall with police so that traffic circulation can be planned accordingly.A senior traffic department official said, “The idea is to avoid congestion around Metro stations and allow more Kolkatans access the new Metro.” The cops have requested Metro Railway to keep at least two ticket counters open at each station during office hours.Metro sources said data relating to daily footfall will, in fact, be computed every day and put up on display boards at the Metro stations. The first phase is all set for commercial operations from Friday and both — the Metro authorities and the local administration — are determined to make the most of the newest addition to the transportation system. While new auto routes are being planned, the state transport department is mulling introducing a minibus route right next to Sector V station.Other modes of commute, like e-rickshaws, are being mulled for stations in Salt Lake, where retro-fitted battery-operated rickshaws are already an effective mode of commute. “We may try to issue more rickshaw licences so that people can access stations like Karunamoyee, Central Park and City Centre.

212,['12/02/2020'],Bowbazar Kolkata: Bowbazar tunnelling to resume,"This story is from February 12, 2020

KMRC has demolished the wobbly structures in Bowbazar to facilitate tunnelling

KOLKATA: The Calcutta high court division bench of Chief Justice Thottathil B Nair Radhakrishnan and justice Arijit Banerjee on Tuesday allowed Kolkata Metro Railway Corporation (KMRC) to resume its tunnelling work in Bowbazar . However, the court has directed KMRC to strictly follow the suggestions of IIT-Madras experts and submit its feedback to them during tunnelling. The court has instructed the Centre and the state government to cooperate in the operation.

On January 7, the court had directed that the National Disaster Management Committee would give its expert opinion on the tunnelling work. The direction came after the state submitted in court that its own disaster management committee lacked the expertise to provide any help in this operation.

Appearing for KMRC, counsels Bikash Bhattacharya and Shreya Basu Mullick submitted in court that the central government had directed KMRC to take opinion from any IIT on resuming tunnelling operations in Bowbazar. They further submitted that KMRC had approached IIT-Madras for suggestions.

Tunnelling operations of East-West Metro has remained suspended at Bowbazar since August 31 last year. On that day, one of the two tunnel-boring machines (TBMs) hit an aquifer, leading to subsidence. Soon after, in September, the division bench had issued an order directing KMRC to stop tunnelling work on a petition by an NGO.

The suggestions were made by IIT-Madras after discussions between the institution’s faculty member professor Rajagopal and members of an expert committee that recommended resuming tunnelling at Bowbazar. On behalf of IIT-Madras, Rajagopal submitted that after discussion with expert committee members and examining its report, the methodology proposed (by the committee) for resuming tunnelling work was feasible and practical. IIT-Madras recommended that monitoring of ground deformations be conducted as per indicated plans. It was also suggested that the plan of action should be along the lines of observational method of construction.

Illustration used for representational purpose.

VADODARA: A refusal to lend his two-wheeler was enough to not only break the joints of a welder’s friendship but also left him mauled.

Such was the ferocity of the cannibalistic outburst that welder Pawan Sharma, a resident of Khanpur, was left bed-ridden for a few days, nursing more than just a broken relationship.

On Monday evening, Sharma met his 17-year-old friend near Deen Dayalnagar in Gotri, who asked him to lend his scooter as he wanted to go to a paan kiosk to smoke. Sharma refused. This angered his teen friend so much that the minor started an argument with him, which later escalated into fisticuffs.

According to police, the minor scratched Sharma’s face and throat with nails and also bit into his right thumb. A profusely bleeding Sharma was also threatened by the teen not come to the locality any more or else face dire consequences, before he left the scene.

Sharma got his hand dressed at a private clinic and later lodged a complaint with Laxmipura police station of assault and criminal intimidation against the boy.

Sharma earlier stayed at the housing settlement in Deen Dayalnagar before moving to Khanpur where he works as a welder in a fabrication workshop. On that fateful day, Sharma had come to Gotri for some work at a tailor’s shop where the ‘friend’ met him.

Police detained the boy, who is currently preparing for his Class X exam, on Tuesday and presented him at a local court which granted him bail.

A cop, however, said that Sharma and the boy were at loggerheads over a previous fight they had a few months ago when the duo was drunk. Due to the previous confrontation, Sharma did not want to lend him his scooter.

Panaji: Congress has alleged that the fiscal deficit in the budget has been miscalculated and deliberately manipulated to show a smaller shortfall in the government's finances. Insisting that the government will run short of Rs 3,373.2 crore in the coming financial year, state Congress president Girish Chodankar said the state's fiscal deficit will stand at Rs 4,648.7 crore or 5.04% of Goa's gross state domestic production.

“In reality, the fiscal deficit for the coming year 2020-21 will be Rs 5,011.97 crore minus Rs 363.2 crore, which is Rs 4,648.6 crore,” Chodankar said. “What this represents is 5.04% of next year’s projected GSDP of Rs 92,260.5 crore, and not 2.01% as mentioned in the budget speech, ” he added, accusing the government of “wreaking havoc on the state’s treasury”.

“This means that at the beginning of the next year, the chief minister is already down by nearly Rs 3,000 crore. So the estimated budget , at Rs 21,056 crore, in reality begins with Rs 18,000 crore, assuming all revenue conditions are as projected,” Chodankar told reporters.

“In the government’s search for revenue sources, the CM has not mentioned anything on casino renewal fees. He wants to keep the BJP ATM very safe,” he said.

Chodankar said the entry plazas at border points announced by the CM to keep a check on entry of vehicles, will defeat the seamless movement of goods under GST, and give scope for corrupt practices. The increase in excise taxes and import fees on liquor will affect the tourism industry, he said.

Erode: Complaining that the public works department was not releasing water from the Bhavanisagar dam for prescribed 10 days but only for six days, farmers from Gobichettipalayam in Erode district urged the district administration to direct PWD officials to release the prescribed water.

Farmers said the state government ordered PWD officials to release water from the Bhavanisagar dam to carry out second term crop cultivation across 2.5 acres in Gobichettipalayam taluk from February 5.

The officials are ordered to release 90tmc of water for ten days alternating between two canals for 100 days.

For the first ten days the canal benefitting lands at Thadapalli and Arakkankottai villages was opened on February 5.

Several farmers have sowed seeds for groundnut cultivation.

“But officials stopped the releasing of water on Monday and only 54tmc of water was released,” M Manickam, a farmer, said, adding that the water will not be adequate to carry out groundnut cultivation.”

“As there was no response from PWD officials, we approached the district administration to look into the issue. We will stage a protest, if the prescribed water were not released, a farmer said.

PWD assistant engineer, Gobichettipalayam circle, S Manickam said the complaint was forwarded to senior officials.

Photo for representative purpose only

MALAPPURAM: It seems the district administration has failed to take an effective step to address the issue of street dog menace and the recurring incidents of street dog attacks in various parts of the district raising serious concerns among the public.

In the latest incident, 18 school students were injured after being attacked by street dogs in Thirunavaya region of the district on Monday and there is demand for raising for a street dog sterilization unit in each local body.

The students were attacked by the dogs from various spots in the border of Kuttippuram grama panchayat and Thirunavaya grama panchayat and they have undergone treatment at district hospital in Tirur .

Faizal Edassery, president of Thirunavaya grama panchayat said that the street dog attacks are regular incidents in the region as there is no effective sterilization programme launched in the district.

Earlier Kudumbashree Mission had launched a street dog sterilization programme in the district. But, it stopped after one week, due to the lack of infrastructure facilities to carry out sterilization surgeries for dogs.

Faizal said that the authorities should deploy a trained team for sterilization at least in every block panchayat and as early as possible.

The district had witnessed many incidents of stray dog attacks during past two years and it seems the efforts taken by the authorities to prevent such incidents were vain.

Four months ago, 15 children were attacked by stray dogs in Marancheri region of the district and the Marancheri panchayat authorities had urged the authorities to take immediate steps to sterilize the street dogs in the region.

Two years ago, a 11-month-old baby in Kodur near Malappuram town was seriously injured in the attack of a stray dog inside her house. After the incident the authorities promised to take proper steps to prevent such incidents in future.

As per the statistics of animal husbandry department authorities there are more than 7,000 stray dogs in the district which are yet to be sterilized.

NAGPUR: The district administration has identified 49,830 farmers eligible for the Mahatma Jyotiba Phule farm loan waiver scheme and also uploaded the details of around 48,000 on the scheme’s portal.

On Tuesday, district collector Ravindra Thakre said the list of eligible farmers would be displayed at each village from February 21. “The authentication process would start immediately after releasing the list. This will be through biometrics or one time password on mobile phone. In case there are issues with biometrics or no mobile phone, the farmers can process it through the tehsildar. Other issues, if any, will be expedited and farmers need to file objection through the tehsildar and we will hold a hearing soon,” he said.

Thakre said around 474 farmers have not linked their Aadhaar with their bank account, which has stalled disbursal of benefits.

The district collector said absence of Aadhaar details has also affected other financial schemes like the Kisan Sanman Yojana. “In the first instalment, we transferred Rs1,12,615, Rs99,623 in second, Rs68,166 in third and just Rs22,410 in the fourth. Aadhaar linkage became compulsory from third instalment onwards, hence the amount started coming down. We appeal to farmers to link Aadhaar at the earliest,” he said.

The same issue has also held up processing of applications of deceased farmers. “The relatives must submit the Aadhaar number to the bank,” he said.

On Kisan Credit Card (KCC), Thakre said around 1.55 lakh small and marginal farmers have availed different financial services of the government while 1.04 lakh have been provided monetary aid under the Pradhan Mantri Yojana. “Around 51,532 have been unable to get any crop loan in the district,” he said.

For such farmers, the administration has started a special drive from February 8 to 23 to make them aware about the KCC benefits. “The farmers can avail a loan of up to Rs1 lakh without interest and up to Rs3 lakh at 1% interest,” he said.

The credit limit will depend on crop preference, land holding, irrigation facility, pumps and CIBIL score.

Nabard district development manager Maithili Kowe said KCC will act as short term working capital for farmers.

Bank of India’s lead district manager Vijaysingh Bais said the idea is to remove the fear in the minds of small and marginal farmers about this lending method.

Vadodara: For once, the Vadodara Municipal Corporation (VMC) is set to complete a project before time. The Sursagar rejuvenation and beautification project that was expected to get over by June this year will be ready on February 21 for Maha Shivratri celebrations.

The project that saw several ups and downs and changes in plans was first discussed in 2014. The standing committee of the VMC cleared the ambitious project in August 2014. The plan then focussed on beautification and creating facilities for recreation at the pond. The project, however, did not take off.

In 2016, the then mayor Bharat Dangar put brakes on the project arguing that it would not make sense to beautify and create recreation facilities if the pond continued to stink. Dangar even pointed out that the thick layer of Plaster of Paris (PoP) at the bed of the pond needed to be cleared first.

Large amounts of PoP had settled in the bed due to immersions of idols in various festivals, particularly Ganpati festivities.

A fresh proposal for the project was brought in October 2017 and was cleared by the standing committee. The project this time around included cleaning of the lake too. Water from the pond was emptied in such a way that the aquatic animals there were not affected. The sludge was then removed and later work began on strengthening its embankments and then beautifying it.

VMC standing committee chairman Satish Patel who visited the site on Tuesday said that the work on the pond will end on February 18. “On this day we will be shown the lighting too. By February 21, it will be ready for the Maha Shivratri event,” he said.

An engineer with the futuristic planning cell of the civic body said that after the event, only some plantation will be done at the site. “We have planned this later, so that tender saplings are not trampled due to the crowd,” the official said.

Representative Image

KOCHI: The high court has clarified its judgment on Marthoman Cheriyapalli at Kothamangalam to allow parishioners to conduct funeral services in tune with the ordinance brought in by the state government.

Justice P B Suresh Kumar considered review petitions regarding the judgment of December 3 that allowed Orthodox priest to administer religious services for burials. Through the judgment, the court had also asked the Ernakulam district collector to take over the church and hand it over to the Orthodox faction, along with ensuring sufficient police protection. Of the three review petitions, one was filed by the district collector and the others by members of Jacobite faction.

The counsels representing the Jacobite faction argued that Kerala Christian Cemeteries (Right to Burial of Corpse) Ordinance, 2020 was promulgated by the state government on January 7 (a bill in this regard, in the meantime, was passed by the assembly on Tuesday).

The court’s directive allowing Orthodox priest to administer religious services for burial goes against the ordinance, the counsels contended.

After considering the submission, the court said in paragraph 13 of the judgment, “The Kerala Christian Cemeteries (Right to Burial of Corpse) Ordinance, 2020 provides that the relatives of the deceased member of a parish may forego funeral services in church or its cemetery or opt for funeral services at any other premises by a priest of their choice. In the light of the said provision, the judgment sought to be reviewed needs to be clarified to the effect that relatives of the deceased members of parish may forgo funeral services in the church or its cemetery or opt for funeral services at any other premises by a priest of their choice. In the result, these review petitions are disposed of with the clarification mentioned in paragraph 13.”

Coimbatore: A headmaster of a panchayat union primary school was transferred by the education department on Tuesday after people from a village near Negamam staged a road roko on Monday night, seeking action against him for sexually harassing girl children. However, none of the parents came forward to lodge complaint against the headmaster and the All India Democratic Women’s Association (AIDWA) and Students Federation of India (SFI) also requested the police to act against him.

More than 20 students are studying in the Panchayat Union Primary School near Negamam and three teachers including a headmaster are working in the school. Around seven girl children from the school made sexual harassment allegations against the school headmaster and he was admitted in a private hospital on Monday. Meanwhile, the parents of the seven children and the villagers staged a road roko on Monday night, demanding the police to arrest the headmaster. Meanwhile, the headmaster was taken to the Negamam police station.

“We tried to get complaints from the parents of the children. None of them was ready to lodge a complaint. When we conducted inquiry with the parents, they claimed that their children were not affected, and they came to know about the issue. So, they staged a protest,” a police officer said.

The police officer added that the AIDWA and SFI functionaries were also asked to lodge a complaint on behalf of the parents of the children. But they also hesitated to lodge a complaint. “So, we plan to take the staff from One Stop Crisis Centre (OSCC) to the village to conduct inquiry with the parents and the school children,” said the officer.

Meanwhile, the school education officials transferred the headmaster out of the school and a woman teacher has been appointed in his place. “Departmental inquiry has been initiated and district education officer (DEO) would conduct the inquiry. Based on the outcome of the inquiry, further departmental action would be taken on the teacher,” the officer said.

Kamat said that while the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) is an amendment brought to the Constitution, Article 30 is enshrined in the Constitution.

“CAA is a constitutional amendment and should be withdrawn. Article 30 is a constitutional provision, enshrined in the Constitution. It has been tested in the Supreme Court from time to time and the Supreme Court has upheld it. It is not a new provision which has been added. Article 30 has been provided by our forefathers who drafted the Constitution. This is a direct attack on minority institutions. The archbishop has every right to express his opinion,” Kamat told reporters on Tuesday.

When asked if he felt BJP was using minority MLAs to target the Church, Kamat said, “I will not make any wild statements simply because somebody is making statements. It is for the people of Goa to understand things in the right perspective. People are smart and know what everyone is talking.”

226,['12/02/2020'],Tirupur and Silvassa to become sister cities,"This story is from February 12, 2020

Coimbatore: The central government has introduced the concept of sister cities and paired the 20 best performing smart cities as sister cities with the least performing smart cities in the country to improve the performance of the latter. Accordingly, the Centre has paired Tirupur which has secured 3rd rank with Silvassa in Gujarat that has secured 87th rank.

A corporation source said that the concept of sister cities was discussed during the third national apex conference held in Vishakapattinam in January. The ideal purpose of introducing the concept was to enhance the performance of the cities especially the ones who had been struggling to implement the projects. The ministry of housing and urban affairs sent an advisory notice to all the smart cities recently.

“The sister cities would enter into a memorandum of understanding (MoU) which would be valid for a year. The cities could extend the validity of the pact to continue their collaboration in the light of changing trends and environment. The MoU is expected to be signed on February 20,” said the source.

The source said that once the agreement is signed, the cities would undertake a 100-day challenge to enhance the performance of the least performing cities and the cities would conduct a joint meeting once in 30 days through video conferencing.

The cities would provide access to financial and technical studies including detailed project reports (DPRs), feasibility study reports and impact assessment reports to each other, the source said, adding that a team from each city would visit the other at least once in the 100 days to understand the projects that are implemented in other cities.

Tirupur corporation commissioner K Sivakumar said that they would extend their support in all possible ways to their sister city.

Representative Image

KOZHIKODE: The high court has struck down the amendment made by the Calicut University to the ‘Constitution of the University Union’ which denied opportunity to around two third of university union councillors (UUCs) elected from self-financing colleges to elect University Union office bearers.

The division bench comprising Justice C K Abdul Rehim and Justice T V Anilkumar issued the order on Tuesday while considering a petition by some UUCs who said that the amendment made by the syndicate on December 3 deprived them of their rights to participate in the election of university union office bearers. They also contended that the amendment was against the modes of election suggested by the ‘Lyngdoh Committee Report’ which was approved by the Supreme Court.

The court said that the changes brought to the constitution of the University Union after completion of the college union elections to the academic year 2019-20 cannot be sustained legally.

The court ordered that the election for the office bearers of the University Union should be completed in accordance with the unamended constitution. It has also directed the university to conduct election of office bearers of the University Union from and by the general council of the Calicut University Union.

University dean of students welfare, meanwhile, said that election to the university union will be held in accordance with the high court verdict and the elections earlier scheduled to be held on February 12 will not take place.

Surat: Two persons involved is a series of cases involving the swapping and swiping of the ATM cards have been arrested by the cyber crime cell of Bharuch’s local crime branch (LCB) police on Tuesday.

Ankit Amresh Prasad Singh and Aman Singh—both working in a paper mill in Halvad near Morbi—were arrested in connection with the ATM card swapping incident reported in Bharuch town on December 6, 2019.

Police said that one Ajit Singh, a resident of Bharuch had gone to withdraw money from the SBI ATM kiosk located at Panch Batti area in the town on December 6, 2019. Singh inserted the card in the kiosk, but was unable to withdraw money.

The duo who was standing outside the kiosk offered to help to the victim and in the process noted down his personal identification number. After few minutes, the they informed Singh that they were unable to withdraw money. They (accused) swapped the ATM card with other SBI ATM card and went away from the spot.

To his surprise, Singh received a text message on his mobile phone that Rs 13,500 was withdrawn from his account. He immediately went to the SBI branch where he was informed that the card was registered in some other person’s name and that it was non-operational.

Talking with TOI, police inspector of LCB’s cyber cell, JN Zala said, “It is a classic case of ATM card swapping where the conmen target senior citizens. They would offer help to the victims and get their PIN number in stealthily. They would keep the original card by giving away ATM card of the same bank. Once the victim would leave the kiosk, they would withdraw money from the account”

Zala added, “In the preliminary interrogation, the accused have confessed to their involvement in two more similar crimes in Bharuch. They are also involved in similar crimes reported in Surat, Chikhli, Vapi, Vyara and Ankleshwar.”

Saligao: Opposition to the recent reclassification of 56 villages as urban areas continued on Tuesday, with BJP Aldona MLA Glenn Ticlo saying there was no need to classify Aldona and Moira as urban areas. Ticlo, who is part of the ruling BJP government, represents both Aldona and Moira, and said they should be allowed to remain villages.

Terming Aldona as “one of the best villages”, he said, “The moment it is notified as an urban area, all types of urban infrastructure will automatically come up there. I feel these villages should not be classified as urban areas.”

Ticlo also said he asked revenue minister Jennifer Monserrate the criteria by which the villages were reclassified by her department.

“She told me they were notified as per Census 2011 for having a population of over 5,000 people,” he said.

The government’s notification reclassifying 56 villages as urban areas has not gone down well. Locals of the villages concerned claim that the move would destroy their respective area’s identity.

On Monday, Congress Curtorim MLA Aleixo Reginaldo Lourenco wrote to chief minister Pramod Sawant and to Monserrate expressing concern about the reclassification of Raia and Curtorim as urban areas.

230,['12/02/2020'],GMCH Trauma Centre’s model to be replicated in Latur,"This story is from February 12, 2020

NAGPUR: The state health department is preparing to replicate the model of the Trauma Center of Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH) at other places now. As an initial move, a team from Latur will be visiting Nagpur’s trauma centre on Wednesday.

A team of the health department and the department of medical education and drugs led by Latur’s civil surgeon Dr Sanjay Dhage will visit the trauma centre to see the infrastructure and facilities.

As per government sources, type III trauma centres will be planned at Renapur and Murud towns in Latur district following the model of Nagpur’s Trauma centre.

Trauma centre in-charge Dr Mohd Faizal said that it is constantly improving the services since inception. “We are treating more patients, conducting more number of surgeries and most importantly, we are successfully reducing the mortality rate,” he said.

As per the data, 4161 patients were admitted to the centre in the year 2019 and 1218 major surgeries were performed. The average mortality rate of the trauma centre remained under 21% in the year 2019.

“In 2020, we have treated 563 patients and conducted 164 surgeries. Interestingly, 56 out of these were neurosurgeries. The mortality rate came down to 10.83% in January 2020,” added Dr Faizal.

The trauma centre is soon going to add 20 more beds. All beds in this centre are equipped with ventilators.

Being a joint project of the central and state government, all patients get free of cost treatment. The patient record of the centre shows that patients are referred here from all parts of Central India. The list has names from Nanded , Mukhed (Marathwada), Hoshangabad , Jabalpur (MP) and Raipur , Bilaspur (Chhattisgarh).

DMER minister Amit Deshmukh and MLA Rohit Pawar had visited this centre during the winter session of state legislature held last year. During this visit, they had decided to establish centres based on similar model in Latur district.

“The trauma centre’s OPD is serving serious patients very effectively. Accident victims are getting treatment in the golden hour due to this centre. We are planning several new departments here in near future,” said Dr Sajal Mitra, dean of GMCH.

GMCH Trauma Centre getting better

GMCH Trauma centre became operational with 30 beds in April 2017

It equipped and staffed to provide care for patients suffering from traumatic injuries

Today, it has 70 beds where patients with injuries such as falls, road accidents are treated

In 2019, Trauma centre treated average 375 patients per month (Jan-Dec)

Average 102 surgeries were performed monthly

Mortality ratio which was 30.8% in January 2019, came down to 10.83% in January 2020

Soon, 20 more beds, ventilators will be added into the Trauma centre

231,['12/02/2020'],Tirupur bags third place in best performing smart cities,"This story is from February 12, 2020

Overtaking all the smart cities that have been lauded as best performing cities in the state during its review meetings, the Tirupur smart city had grabbed third place in the best performing smart cities.

Top 20 best performing cities are selected by the Union ministry of housing and urban affairs to support the least performing cities under the mission.

It is one of the internal rankings prepared by the ministry and the ranking list was prepared based on several parameters including the value of tender issued, value of work orders issued, value of works completed, and value of utilization certificate submitted, a corporation source said. Tirupur has managed to secure 329.75 marks for its performance.

“Even though Tirupur is selected under the smart city mission only during the third round in 2017 and as many as 18 projects are already in implementation stage and another four projects are in work order issuing stage. Most of the projects were moved to execution stage only in the last couple of years,” Tirupur corporation commissioner K Sivakumar said.

The projects in execution stage includes water supply improvement scheme, construction of fish market, installation of solar plants and redevelopment of daily and weekly flower markets.

Explaining that most of the projects would be completed within 1 to 1.5 years, he said that visible changes could be seen in the city within a couple of years. Under the smart cities mission, they had created four parks at the cost of Rs 3.86 crore.

Further, he said that they could even perform better with the cooperation of the public, public representatives and stake holders of the projects.

Meanwhile, the Coimbatore corporation which has managed to complete highest number of projects – 18 works - in the state and was often lauded for its performance, has secured 179.9 marks and grabbed 23rd position in the ranking.

While the officials are clueless about how they went down the ranking, experts pinpoint the slow progress of the projects. Even though it has been four years since Coimbatore was selected under the smart city mission, no visible changes are being seen in the city, said the experts.

Meanwhile, sources privy to analysing the performance of the cities said that the ministry is in the process of developing a new formula and the performance of the cities would be assessed another time.

Visakhapatnam: Classes are yet to start five years after temporary arrangements were made for a Kendriya Vidyalaya in Anakapalle .

State tourism minister Muttamsetti Srinivasa Rao had previously urged the Centre to grant permission to start classes under the temporary arrangement when he was Anakapalle MP.

The district authorities had allotted ten acres of land at Acchiyyapeta village after Srinivasa Rao proposed the school for children of central government employees and public sector units working under Anakapalle and Yalamanchili constituencies.

Land was allotted in the survey number 511 in the Acchiyyapeta village and an approach road to the site was also assigned by the department of endowments. “The authorities had also constructed a culvert on the ‘gedda’ (a small canal). Every year, there is an expectation that the central school would commence classes, but every year their hopes are dashed,” said Buddha Bhaskara Rao, a degree student at Anakapalle.

After the school was sanctioned, district authorities constructed temporary sheds in Woodpeta High School where classes were to have taken place.

Some sections of the public said while the government in the state had changed since the school was announced and political leaders changed affiliations, work on the school is yet to progress.

Vadodara: A woman running tuition classes at her home on Dabhoi Road was beaten by a group of people in her neighbourhood over a confusion of calling a PCR van.

The tuition teacher Kishori Mer had called a PCR van to complain against her neighbours over a petty fight on February 6. The PCR van could not find Mer’s building and the cops could not hear her voice on phone call. Due to miscommunication, the cops assumed that Mer had complained against DJ being played in the locality beyond permitted time limit.

Police went to the party and asked the organizers to shut down the DJ as they had received complaint from Mer. Meanwhile, Mer also reached the other building block to guide the cops towards her home. However, by then revellers were infuriated by the police action and they pounced upon Mer and beat her up in cops’ presence.

The policemen tried to intervene, but the attackers outnumbered them. A while later, the attackers retreated as police showed their force. Mer then started walking towards her building block along with cops and attackers again beat her up and hurled abuses at her. Second time, Mer managed to video record the violence in her phone. But when the accused realized that she was recording, one of them snatched her phone and damaged it.

The mob was dispersed again by police and Mer was asked to register a police complaint. She lodged the case on Monday after the data from her damaged phone was retrieved. Cops have booked Salma, Anjum, their husbands and four other unidentified persons for rioting and assault.

“Central government’s policy of selling PSUs will turn into an obstacle for the development of the country and destroy its future. There needs to be interventions from various quarters to make the Centre rectify this policy of opening up various sectors to corporates on the basis of globalization policies,” he said, while responding to a calling attention motion moved by MLA K Rajan .

Citing the Centre’s decision to disinvest various companies, including LIC of India, he said the Centre was going ahead with the plan despite strong protests. “The government is moving ahead with an alternative policy against the Centre’s privatization policy. The state government has initiated measures to take over Hindustan Newsprint Ltd, which the Centre decided to privatize, besides the Palakkad unit of Instrumentation Ltd and BHEL,” he said adding that the state has also intervened to take up Trivandrum airport.

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The opposition alleged misappropriation of World Bank loan of Rs 1,750 crores taken for Rebuild Kerala Initiative (RKI) by the state government and staged a walkout from the assembly on Tuesday to protest ‘the government’s failure in initiating rehabilitation and rebuilding measures after the two consecutive monsoon floods’.

Meanwhile, chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan said the projects under RKI will take three years for completion. “The Rebuild Kerala Development Programme (RKDP), was prepared with the assistance of global experts not as a programme which could be implemented in one year but as one to be completed over three years,” the CM said, while responding to an adjournment motion moved by IUML MLA M Basheer raising the allegation.

Though the CM elaborated on the ‘multi-sector activity’ involving various government departments and other agencies, the high-level empowered committee (HLEC) meetings and administrative sanction given to several projects, the opposition held on to its allegation that the government misappropriated the first installment of the WB loan for RKI.

“As per the order of the expenditure wing of the central government, the first installment of the loan needs to be handed over to the respective projects within seven days to evade additional interest. The CM says that the funds will be transferred at the time of implementation of the projects, which is a serious violation. The state will have to pay huge interest for this misappropriation,” said opposition leader Ramesh Chennithala , before staging the walkout.

He also criticized the LDF government for ‘not spending a single rupee from Rs 1,000 crore earmarked in the 2019-20 budget for Rebuild Kerala and said there were people affected by the 2018 floods who are yet to receive the due compensation. “This government, with its inefficiency, cannot protect Kerala in case of another natural calamity,” Ramesh added.

The CM, while defending the government’s position, said administrative sanction was given to various projects submitted for sectors including agriculture, animal husbandry, fisheries, livelihood jobs, transport and water resources.

237,['12/02/2020'],Manufacturers raise concerns over central govt’s announcement on solar pumps,"This story is from February 12, 2020

Coimbatore: Pump manufacturers from the city say they have little to cheer about the announcement in Union Budget that the central government would provide funds to 20 lakh farmers to set up solar pumps.

Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman had announced in the Union Budget on February 1 that the Centre, under the Pradhan Mantri Kisan Urja Suraksha Utthan Mahabhiyan (PM Kusum) scheme, would provide funds to 20 lakh farmers to set up stand-alone solar pumps.

However, pump manufacturers from the district, a hub which caters to around 55% of the country’s pump demands, said the announcement has not made them smile. There are two reasons. One section of micro and small pump manufacturers say they would not be able to invest on changing their infrastructure to manufacture solar panels and getting licences to make solar pumps. Another section of pump manufacturers said the Centre’s announcement has certain technical specifications for solar pumps, which were not suitable.

There are around 3,000 micro, small and medium pump manufacturers in the district, president of Kovai Power Driven Pumps and Spares Manufacturers Association (KOPMA) K Maniraj said.

“It is difficult for small manufacturers who have been manufacturing electric pumps for more than seven decades now to invest and shift to making solar pumps. Only a very few big players would be able to do it,” he said.

Manufacturing solar pumps would need MSME units to get a licence from the ministry of new and renewable energy (MNRE) and involve in R and D, which would also mean extra investments, he said. “If the Centre gives us subsidies for investing in technology and R and D, MSMEs can form a cluster and manufacture solar pumps,” he said.

Another view from industrialists was that manufacturers here had the capacity to make solar pumps, but the technical specifications given by the Centre were not suitable for them.

Vice-president of The Southern India Engineering Manufacturers’ Association (SIEMA) K V Karthik said there was a specification which says the Centre expects only stainless-steel pumps. “This can be interpreted as solar pumps with welded components made of stainless steel sheet-metal. This kind is unsuitable for Indian conditions and the failure rate would he high,” he said. Here, pumps are manufactured with cast stainless steel rotating part and other parts are made with cast iron and engineering plastic, he added.

The Centre has also sought only DC pumps, which use a permanent magnet. “These magnets can be imported only from China. This would mean we would be giving 30% of the product cost to China. Policy makers have focused on efficiency. But for the sake of 2%-3% efficiency increase, we would be giving crores of forex to China,” he said.

He said the Centre should relax these specifications to help local manufacturers.

A nylon yarn plant in Surat

SURAT: Powerloom weavers and knitters manufacturing nylon fabrics have threatened to launch agitation against the Central government for imposing anti-dumping duty on the import of nylon filament yarn.

Industry sources said that the final hearing on the anti-dumping duty on the import of nylon filament yarn will be held by the Directorate General of Trade Remedies (DGTR) in New Delhi on Wednesday.

Weavers stated that the nylon yarn prices have already gone up by Rs 10 per kg in the local market ahead of the decision by the DGTR. They fear that the move may force the weavers to shut down their units due high prices of yarn.

Mayur Golwala, leader of the Nylon Yarn Weavers Association said, “The anti-dumping duty will force many weavers to shut their units. The weavers are prepared to launch agitation against the government’s decision.”

“The decision will lead to increase in yarn prices by Rs 80 per kilogram and the fabric cost will go up to Rs 4 per metre. At present, the industry is consuming about 30% of the nylon yarn imported from other countries.”

A nylon weaver, Bhupendra Chawala told TOI, “As the government abolished duty on import of purified terephthalic acid (PTA), the yarn spinners increased prices by Rs 10 per kilogram. If anti-dumping duty on nylon yarn is imposed, the prices will go up further upto Rs 100 per kilogram. We will have no choice, but to shut the units.”

Another weaver, Jayesh Satyawala said, “The cost of production of nylon fabric will go up and the traders will not purchase nylon fabrics. This will render many jobless in the nylon weaving sector. We can only hope that the government takes a positive stand in favour of the weavers or else our sector will be on the death bed.”

KC palanisam

COIMBATORE: Principal district and sessions judge R Sakthivel on Tuesday evening granted conditional bail to former Tiruchengode MP and expelled AIADMK leader KC Palanisamy. He was directed to sign before the judicial magistrate, Sulur, twice every day at 10.30am and 5pm until further order.

The copy of bail order to reach the prison authorities on Wednesday and he is likely to come out of the prison in the afternoon or evening.

The court also told in the order that if he fail to comply with the conditions regularly, the bail will be cancelled automatically. He should not tamper the evidence or witness either during investigation or trial.

On January 25, KC Palanisamy was arrested by the Sulur police for running a fake AIADMK website and he was booked under 15 sections of Indian Penal Code and two sections of Information Technology Act.

The case was filed based on a complaint from Muthugoundenpudur village panchayat president V P Kandavel that the former MP impersonated himself as the member of the AIADMK despite being expelled by the party in 2018 and created a web portal www.aiadmk.org.in suggesting that the AIADMK and MGR loyalists were rallying behind him. “He cheated the public by distributing membership cards. He has used the twitter feeds of the AIADMK official handle and published the old bylaws of the AIADMK, hiding the fact that they were modified several times in the past,” Kandavel said.

KC Palanisamy has been spending his days behind the bars at the Coimbatore central prison from January 25. Earlier his bail petitions were rejected by the judicial magistrate court, Sulur and PDJ court.

Again, he filed petition before the PDJ court seeking bail from the court. Lawyer R Sivakumar who appeared on behalf of Palanisamy said Palanisamy filed a writ petition before the New Delhi High Court and the case is pending before the court. He has been falsely roped in this case, only because of political vengeance.

After hearing the arguments of defence counsel and prosecution, the judge has granted bail to Palanisamy.

SURAT: A visit to the Statue of Unity (SoU) at Kevadiya will also be a healthy affair for tourists in the near future. The tourist destination will soon be free of plastic drinking water bottles.

The forest department will introduce returnable glass water bottles, but unlike the simple RO water in packaged plastic drinking water bottles, these will contain enhanced pure Narmada water. What’s more, the water will be infused with weather-based herb flavours — tulsi for rainy season, mint and fennel as coolants for summer and ginger to nip the winter bite.

The environment-friendly alternative which has been christened as ‘Ekta Paani’ by additional chief secretary (ACS), forests, environment and climate change, Dr Rajiv Kumar Gupta, aims for zero waste based on a circular economy concept.

“The packaging unit will be set up at Ekta Nursery at Kevadiya and will be run by Ekta Mahila Mandal Trust in association with Vadodara-based startup, Srishti Lifescience, said Pratik Pandya, deputy conservator of forests, Narmada, (social forestry).”

Besides reducing plastic menace, the glass bottle plant will be run exclusively by local tribal women, he said. The department is setting up the plant at a cost of Rs 15 lakh.

“Considering that every visitor consumes two litres of water during a day visit, 4.72 lakh bottles of one-litre single-use plastic bottles are being used every month. If a one such bottle contains 22 grams of plastic, a base estimate of 4.72 lakh plastic bottles will translate into generation of 10.384 tonnes of single-use plastic waste every month,” an SoU official said.

Initially, the production capacity of the plant will be 3,000 bottles per day which will be ramped up to 14,000 daily soon.

“Consumers can return the empty bottles for an attractive buyback pricing or even choose to carry it home as SoU memoir. This initiative is our attempt to reduce carbon footprint and also eliminate the risk of micro-plastic intake by human beings,’’ Prateek Patel, founder of Srishti Lifescience, told TOI.

According to an estimate, over 28 lakh visited SoU in the last 13 months.

Bottles will be available in one litre and 500 ml while the prices are yet to be fixed.

Coimbatore: The number of passengers arriving in the city from Singapore has reduced by nearly a half following the coronavirus outbreak, public health department officials said.

The number of passengers arriving from Singapore, which is usually around 170, has drastically reduced because they fear quarantine and movement restriction, deputy director of public health Dr Ramesh said. “Some days, only 50 people arrive from the island nation. We believe it is because of the coronavirus. Singapore is restricting exit and we are also restricting entry and movement if they show symptoms,” he told TOI.

The department has deployed four teams at the airport to screen passengers showing symptoms of the coronavirus, the official said. “I have received enquiries from people planning to fly into the city from Singapore and Malaysia on the quarantine conditions and restrictions in Tamil Nadu. Of the three people who called me, two cancelled their plans after I told them that we will quarantine them for 28 days if they have flu symptoms.”

However, airport authorities said that the fluctuation in the number of passengers flying into the city from Singapore is normal and could even be seasonal, with February and March being exam season in many places. “We are not noticing a sharp drastic decline,” airport director K Mahalingam said.

The seven Indians, who returned from China, have completed their quarantine period, said the director. “Now we are monitoring everyone landing from abroad displaying flu symptoms. The four medical health teams at the airport are ensuring that all passengers walk through the thermal scanner before leaving the airport. Since Singapore seems to have almost the second highest number of cases after China, we are monitoring patients who are flying in from the city.”

Meanwhile, 12 people continue to be under quarantine in the district, including a Chinese woman and her two children from Yunan. But none of them have tested positive for the virus.

Though most viruses die out during the summer, health officials said the behavior and viability of the coronavirus cannot be predicted. “We will have to wait for the peak summer to set in and see if the virus dies out like others and stops spreading,” said a health officer.

Jaipur: Jaipur Municipal Corporation (JMC) commissioner on Tuesday issued an order saying no official will be able to leave office without signing a register from Wednesday.

The orders were issued in compliance with the orders of the department of administrative reforms issued on January 29 in which officials are asked not to leave the seat during office hours.

Commissioner V P Singh has mentioned in the order that no official from Jaipur Greater/Heritage is allowed to leave the office building at Lalkothi from 9.30 am to 6 pm (except from 1.30 pm to 2 pm for lunch). If there is a need to leave the building, a register will be maintained at every cell where an officer has to sign and give reasons for leaving the office building.

An official said, “These are in compliance with the orders by the department of administrative reforms. How many people will follow it has to be checked. At Jaipur Municipal Corporation, most of us have field work and here it will not be feasible to sign every time we go out. This will be suitable for offices where they have desk work.”

However, as per sources, there have been many complaints filed by the people against the officials for not being at their seat during office hours.

“Usual work at JMC starts at 11 am then from 1.30 to 2.30 pm usually officials have their lunch and then they move out. When they come back at around 4 pm, it will be almost time of going home. This order is necessary to curtail such practises,” said an official on condition of anonymity.

ERODE: The forest department is conducting a four-day workshop at Bannari in Erode district , along with Wildlife Institute of India, to give hands-on training to officials on operating drones to monitor wildlife at Sathyamangalam Tiger Reserve (STR). The workshop started from Tuesday. “We will monitor, as well as human movements, in STR using drones,” a forest official said.

The forest official said that the main purpose of the drones was to curb man-animal conflict. Animals such as elephants usually raid crops while leopards enter nearby hamlets and attack cows, goats and sheep. “The drones can also help us identify forest fires, which is very common during summer,” the official said.

According to forest officials, they also struggle to identify water bodies after they have gone dry. “It’s very hard for us to reach the water bodies situated deep in the forest,” the official said. The forest department has procured two drones. After studying its impact, the department will decide whether to get more drones or not, a forest official said. An official of Wildlife Institute, Krishna Kumar, said these drones could function on radio frequencies. “They can fly up to an altitude of 80 meters for 20 minutes,"" he said.

Trichy: The city corporation has floated a tender to buy two truck-mounted road sweeping machines in a bid to strengthen solid waste management (SWM). The machines estimated to cost Rs 1.76 crore will be bought spending from the smart cities mission fund.

The road sweeping machines will be used for clearing the litters and silt along the commercial streets and arterial roads.

The civic body will separately purchase 40 light commercial vehicle (LCV) mini trucks for the door-to-door waste collection process.

The corporation said that they opted to use the smart cities mission fund for buying the new waste collection vehicles as the number of vehicles available did not meet the requirments.

After obtaining the administrative and technical sanctions from the high-powered steering committee of smart cities mission, the civic body last week also floated a tender to buy 40 mini-trucks for door-to-door waste collection.

“Every month, new properties are coming up in the city. We need to increase the number of our waste collection vehicles correspondingly to ensure fool-proof door-to-door waste collection,” a senior official said.

At an estimated cost of Rs 2.34 crores, the civic body in the next few months will buy 40 mini-trucks for door-to-door waste collection to strengthen solid waste management (SWM). The mini-trucks will have a storage capacity of 2 cubic metres each to stock the waste, the vehicles are likely to be given compartments for receiving waste separately as biodegradable and non-biodegradable from residents and commercial outlets.

Officials said that the presence of truck-mounted road sweepers with six cubic metres storage capacity each will help them to clean the major roads in a short time.

247,['12/02/2020'],‘Govt should give thrust on sectors with natural edge’,"This story is from February 12, 2020

Jaipur: The business community in Rajasthan said that the state budget presents an opportunity for the government to minimize the impact of economic slowdown in the country by pushing and promoting innovative ideas to attract investors. Similarly, they said the government should not also lose sight of its natural strengths in specific sectors.

Anand Singhal, former president of CII-Rajasthan, said that land prices have become costlier hindering investments. “We need to react dynamically to any emerging situation. Currently, high land prices are a deterrent for new investments. To obviate the challenges, the government can think of providing plug and play facilities on rent in industrial areas,” said Singhal.

The government has already identified thrust sectors. There are many industries like ceramic where Rajasthan has natural advantage. Dileep Baid, member, Committee of Administration of Export Promotion Council for Handicrafts, said, “Rajasthan is the raw material resource base for ceramic industry. Diesel is a major component of manufacturing cost but the existing policy does not allow exporters to take input credit for CST paid on the fuel. This needs to be addressed so that our products could be competitive in the global market and the size of the industry would expand.”

Retaining labour is also one of the biggest concerns for the industry. Digvijay Dhabriya, chairman, PHDCCI-Rajasthan, said that there should be accommodation facility in every industrial area and some portion of the land should be reserved for that.

“RIICO should reserve 15-20% of land in any industrial area for labour accommodation. The government can even construct affordable houses and there would be demand from industries who would like to use them for their labour accommodation,” added Dhabriya.

Often it is seen that new industrial areas, away from cities and towns, do not have public transport facilities. It takes years for the government to dedicate bus routes that are important for workers to travel to factories or plants. “Accommodation inside the industrial zone can also overcome the transport problem,” added Dhabriya.

Appearing for the petitioners, senior counsel Surender Rao said that while a Parliament member will have a voting right in his capacity as ex officio member of that municipality, TRS Rajya Sabha member K Keshava Rao’s decision to exercise his vote at Tukkuguda should be declared as illegal because the Rajya Sabha secretariat had declared in 2014 itself that he was allotted to AP and hence the voting right he used in Telangana becomes invalid.

The notification said 31 questions would be asked during the house-listing operations including about drinking water source, access to latrines, number of married couples in a household and whether they owned a smartphone, laptop, scooter, motorcycle, etc.

The notification, however, made it clear that the mobile number would be sought only for census-related communications and not for any other purpose.

Hyderabad: Farmers with non-performing assets (NPAs) could come under government scrutiny ahead of the second phase of the loan waiver scheme, which will be rolled out soon.

Accounts of those farmers, who have not repaid their loans for two years or more, could be categorised under NPAs. While the government has announced that farmers who have outstanding loans till December 18, 2018, will be eligible for the waiver scheme (up to Rs 1 lakh), scrutiny of NPAs is new criteria which was not included when the loan waiver scheme was implemented in the first cycle between 2015-2019.

Farmers get one year to clear the loans with an average interest rate of 9%. Farmers who pay their loans within the stipulated period get 5% interest subvention (this scheme aims at providing short-term credit to farmers at subsidised interest rate) from the Centre and those who do not pay within one year will get 2% subsidy on the interest rate. If the farmers do not clear loans for more than a year, they will not be able to get subsidy on the interest rate. Currently, 4,51,459 farmers have credit loan accounts in Telangana and 5.62% of them have NPAs.

Highly-placed sources told TOI that the state government had constituted a committee to fix the modalities and guidelines to implement the loan waiver scheme. “The format under which the eligible farmers will be decided is not decided yet. Farmers with NPAs was discussed but a final call will be taken by the government,” sources said. It may be recalled CM K Chandrasekhar Rao had asked the farmers to repay their loans. Sources said other guidelines like one farmer family getting the loan waiver would remain the same.

There was also a discussion on whether farmers should be given waiver amount in cheques or transferred to their accounts like last time, sources said. The government is also considering waiving loans up to Rs 50,000 in one go. Last time, the waiver was implemented in instalments. “It will benefit marginalised farmers if it is waived in one go,” sources said.

The CM said district collectors will have a bigger role in the transformation of villages and kept Rs 1 crore with each collector for emergency works.

Action will be taken against the officials concerned if there is no change in the villages in terms of cleanliness and greenery,” KCR warned during the marathon collectors’ conference which went on for eleven hours at Pragathi Bhavan on Tuesday.

Stressing that the collectors should ensure implementation of government policies and schemes, KCR said he is keen on seeing a visible change in villages in next 25 days.

After the panchayat meets, surprise checks would be conducted, he said. “Flying squads will tour the state to take stock of the situation,” the CM said.

The government appointed additional collectors to support district collectors with a view to transforming the villages. The CM instructed collectors not to give the additional collectors any work as they should take responsibility to make panchayats efficient. The CM said wireless sets would be provided to the collectors to interact with the officials.

“Like Palle Pragathi is aimed at development of villages, Pattana Pragathi for urban areas will be launched by the government soon,” he said and added that government would release Rs 78 crore per month for Hyderabad and Rs 70 crore to other cities.

255,['12/02/2020'],Overuse of green corridors worries B’luru doctors,"This story is from February 12, 2020

Bengaluru: A 10-day-old boy with congenital heart disease was brought in an ambulance from Shivamogga to Bengaluru through a green corridor two days ago. But doctors in Bengaluru said there was no emergency warranting the baby to be rushed to the city, empathising with the parents for spending a huge sum on the private ambulance.

Doctors found the baby stable and suggested he be operated only after 2-3 months as he weighed only 1.8kg and had to gain weight and stability. The case could have been treated in the district hospital first, they said, regretting that patients who can be managed locally are being rushed to Benglauru through green corridors.

However, a Mangaluru child brought to Bengaluru last week was in need of emergency care, they said.

The Shivamogga child’s father, Swamy H, a farm labourer, spent Rs 16,000 on the ambulance alone. The baby was first brought to Sri Jayadeva Institute of Cardiovascular Sciences and Research (SJICSR) and later referred to Indira Gandhi Institute of Child Health (IGICH).

“We learnt the family had to pledge gold to bear the ambulance cost. Apparently, the driver had one more person with him and he kept clicking photos and shooting videos throughout the journey. The baby did not even require a ventilator-fitted ambulance,” said Dr KS Sanjay, director, IGICH.

“Medical professionals referring cases to us must ideally communicate with our doctors and share medical documents of the patient,” said Dr CN Manjunath, director, SJICSR, adding: “Before sending a case to a tertiary hospital, those handling it must first communicate with the doctors to whom they are referring it.”

“We are now seeing a trend of ambulances ferrying sick babies from different districts to Bengaluru via green corridors. The provision should not be overused. Green corridor is to be used only to transport organs for a cadaver transplant and heart attack patients. In all other cases, including babies with cardiac ailments, a delay of six hours is the same as 24 hours,” he said.

COSTLY AFFAIR

With the 108 government ambulances plying largely within cities, the public ends up depending on private ambulances that charge exorbitantly. Shifting a patient from Shivamogga to Bengaluru costs anywhere between Rs10,000 and Rs 20,000, depending on facilities available in the ambulance.

While there is no provision for the government to run 108 GVK EMRI Arogya Kavacha ambulances to ply a patient from one place to another another, there have been such cases in North Karnataka. “We do have cases where patients have been taken from Haveri to Hubballi or from Belagavi to Sangli in Maharashtra in case of emergencies. The thumb rule we follow in emergencies is to stabilise the patient and take him/her to a nearby government hospital, which could be 3-10km away,” said Hanumanth RG, in charge head, GVK EMRI, Karnataka.

256,['12/02/2020'],Rs 620 crore will be invested to boost marine production in T and AP: NFDB,"This story is from February 12, 2020

In its efforts to increase aquatic production in Telangana and Andhra Pradesh, NFDB is planning to come up with marine fish seed rearing centres. The move, in collaboration with Central Marine Fisheries Research Institute, Kochi will help in developing seeds best suited for extreme climate, later to be put in the sea to increase the production, say officials.

“An amount of Rs 620 crore has been earmarked for development of intensive aquaculture in ponds and tanks and the proposed activities are expected to generate substantial investments resulting in annual production of 26.5 lakh tonnes of fish,” the NFDB said in a statement. Officials say that the availability of fish seeds is satisfactory in certain parts of the country, whereas farmers in rural areas of T state at times face difficulties in procurement of quality seeds.

“Transportation of seeds over a long distance adds to the cost of inputs, therefore to meet their requirements of supplementary stocking in the reservoirs and ponds, we are aiming to set up fish seed rearing units for production of quality fish seeds near them,” a senior NDFB executive told TOI.

“Most of the fish breeds like shrimps, tuna, and cuttlefish are majorly exported to USA, European countries, and China and it can hold a key in increasing our exports,” he added. The authorities are also planning to develop seed production centres to help contribute substantially for the aquaculture production in the state during non-breeding seasons too.

258,['12/02/2020'],BMTC hopes to cash in on high parking fee at railway station,"Private vehicles exceeding a seven-minute grace period at KSR City railway station must pay a parking fee

Users want real-time info

BENGALURU: It’s been nearly two months since the BMTC began to pick up and drop passengers at KSR City railway station .Initially, South Western Railway allowed BMTC to operate buses through the third entrance of the railway station but later said buses could access the main entrance as well.The decision of Indian Railway Stations Development Corporation (IRSDC), which maintains KSR City railway station, to hike parking charges from January 25 has come as a boon to BMTC. It is hoping that more people will switch to buses from private vehicles due to the high parking fees.Currently, private vehicles exceeding a seven-minute grace period at the station must pay a parking fee. For fourwheelers, the fee is Rs 25 for the first two hours and Rs 20 for every additional hour. For twowheelers, it is Rs 12 for the first two hours and Rs 10 for every subsequent hour. Monthly passes for four-wheelers and twowheelers cost Rs 3,000 and Rs 1,000, respectively.Earlier, minimum parking fee for two-wheelers was Rs 10 and maximum Rs 50. For cars, it was Rs 20 and Rs 300. Now, the fee for a two-wheeler for 24 hours is Rs 232, which is more than the Bengaluru-Mysuru train fare.“The hike in parking charges will discourage passengers from coming to the station in private vehicles. The station now has BMTC, Metro connectivity, app-based cabs, rental scooters and bicycles. The new charges are applicable to all stations managed by IRSDC across the country,” said an IRSDC official.TOI found that poor frequency of buses, no display of realtime data, absence of bus bays and a waiting area are a dampener for bus passengers at the railway station.“I stopped taking my twowheeler to the station after they increased parking fees. But the frequency of BMTC buses from the station is poor and unreliable. They should have provided a passenger information system at the station like in the airport,” said Mohan K, a railway passenger.“We are operating about 250 buses through the station. We had requested railways for a bus bay to halt our buses and a waiting area for passengers. But it hasn’t been provided yet. Our buses now stop for two-three minutes at the station,” said a senior BMTC official.An IRSDC official said they are looking to provide parking space for buses at the station. “It’s the BMTC’s responsibility to provide real-time data of buses. We are closely working with them to increase patronage of buses to reduce congestion on the station premises,” the official said.",bengaluru,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74093333,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-693535,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/bmtc-hopes-to-cash-in-on-high-parking-fee-at-rly-station/articleshow/74089727.cms

Motera stadium (File Photo)

GANDHINAGAR: With the White House finally announcing that US President Donald Trump will visit Ahmedabad during his India tour on February 24 and 25, the Gujarat government has begun the massive exercise to select 1.10 lakh people to attend an event at the Motera stadium . At the event, Trump will join Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

The Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) has already gone on an overdrive and has identified 15 parking plots for 5,600 cars and 2,100 buses. Each plot will accommodate 300 to 500 two-wheelers. The plots will have electronic counters showing the availability of parking space.

Chief minister Vijay Rupani held a meeting with top officials and ministers on Tuesday in Gandhinagar to plan for the event. Students, professionals, and businesspeople from across the state, — along with a sizable number of NRIs of Gujarati origin — are expected to participate in the event.

A top government official said that every single participant will be verified by the government before the name is sent to security agencies for approval. “AMC officials and collectors of other districts have been asked to verify and provide plans for the mobilization of participants,” the official said. “Plans are being finalized to accommodate 1.10 lakh participants at the stadium.”

Sources privy to discussions of the CM’s meeting said, “The likely visit of President Trump and PM Modi to the Sabarmati Ashram and thereafter to the Motera stadium were discussed,” a source said. “Security aspects, details of a cultural show, and the routes of the VVIPs were also discussed.”

The Gujarat Cricket Association (GCA) has been assigned the responsibly of organizing the cultural show at the stadium in association with the state’s youth and cultural affairs department and the tourism department.

“Although the ministry of external affairs (MEA) is yet to share a detailed plan of Trump’s visit, we are adhering to the MEA’s tentative plan, which states that Trump and PM Modi will spend around half an hour at the Sabarmati Ashram and between one-and-a-half and two hours at the Motera stadium,” said a government official. Hotel bookings for the US delegation will be finalized after a pre-liaison visit by US representatives, the official added.

261,['12/02/2020'],KSRTC’s most frequent passenger made 148 Bengaluru-Ernakulam trips last year,"This story is from February 12, 2020

Sagin Sebastian

BENGALURU: A Kerala techie working in Bengaluru who pays regular visits to his hometown Ernakulam has emerged Karnataka State Road Transport Corporation’s most frequent commuter in terms of online booking in 2019.

KSRTC’s online booking data show Sagin Sebastian (43) booked 148 tickets last year and paid Rs 1.8 lakh towards the fare. “I’ve been travelling to Ernakulam every weekend for the past three years to visit my family including three children. Earlier, I used to take the train but now I travel only by KSRTC buses,” he told TOI.

A Bengaluru-Ernakulam bus journey takes about 10 hours and cost an average of Rs 1,200 per ticket. “KSRTC is cheaper and more reliable than private bus operators. There have been several instances of its crew waiting for me when I was stuck in traffic while heading to the bus terminus. KSRTC also allows one to book tickets 30 days in advance, enabling me to plan my journey,” he added.

The corporation has collated information about passengers who have booked maximum tickets through its website. Its second-most frequent commuter is Dhruvaraj S (137 tickets), who also travelled on the Bengaluru-Ernakulam route and paid Rs 1.5 lakh for the tickets. K Navaneetha Gopalakrishnan stood third after having booked 134 tickets worth over Rs 1 lakh (Bengaluru-Puducherry route).

Twelve travellers booked more than 100 tickets each last year on the KSRTC website. Most of them were intercity passengers travelling to Ernakulam, Chennai, Vijayawada, Hyderabad, Thrissur, Panaji and Palakkad. These passengers booked tickets through ksrtc.in and don’t include those purchasing offline tickets.

Asked why passengers travelling within Karnataka didn’t figure in the list, an official said they often purchase tickets directly from conductors or from ticket counters, and the corporation doesn’t have their data.

KSRTC officials said they have around 30 lakh online users till date, including 15 lakh registered ones. About 20% of the total tickets issued are booked online. For a brief period, KSRTC online booking services were provided by other websites, but the provision was scrapped after a few of them reportedly favoured private firms over KSRTC.

“We have a loyal customer base, particularly of women passengers. They only travel by KSRTC and visit our website to book tickets. Passengers can also book at authorised ticket counters and BangaloreOne centres,” said the official.

KSRTC managing director Shivayogi C Kalasad has called for a meeting of around 50 frequent passengers on February 29 for feedback on improving its services. KSRTC is also planning to provide a complimentary ticket (to and fro) to them. A senior official said: “The idea is to get feedback from our loyal customers about the quality of services, crew behaviour and running time. We’ll get to know how we can improve.”

Representative image

BENGALURU: A 35-year-old private company employee allegedly bludgeoned his 36-year-old landlady to death and attempted to murder her paralysed husband and daughter at their ground floor house before committing suicide by hanging himself from a ceiling fan in his first floor home in Hegganahalli, off Magadi Road, in the wee hours of Tuesday.

According to police, the incident came to light around 10.45am, when a woman from the neighbourhood visited the house of Lakshmi Shivaraj, a garment factory employee. She was shocked to see Lakshmi’s body in the hall, her daughter Chaitra lying unconscious on a cot and husband Shivaraj sitting helplessly in a pool of blood. The neighbours alerted Rajagopalanagar police.

Cops rushed to the spot and sent Shivaraj and Chaitra to a nearby private hospital. They suspect Lakshmi and Chaitra were attacked with a blunt object and the killer tried to slit Shivaraj’s throat before fleeing.

Within minutes, police found Rangadhamaiah, 35, a factory employee and Shivaraj’s tenant, hanging from the ceiling in his single bedroom house on the first floor of the same building. “We found a knife in Rangadhamaiah’s stomach, which he apparently used to stab himself before committing suicide,” a police officer said.

N Shashikumar, deputy commissioner of police (north) confirmed Rangadhamaiah was the killer and he planned to eliminate the entire family of Lakshmi as she abruptly discontinued her affair with him.

The DCP said CCTV footage from an adjacent building had captured Rangadhamaiah entering Lakshmi’s house around 12am and coming out by 4am. “Having thought he had killed all three, he attempted suicide by stabbing himself. He later hanged himself,” Shashikumar said.

Citing preliminary probe, Shashikumar said Rangadhamaiah had an affair with Lakshmi. But recently Chaitra, 16, and Shivaraj, 38, who runs a provision store in the area, convinced Lakshmi to stay away from Rangadhamaiah, which left him furious and determined to eliminate her entire family.

Shivaraj is in the intensive care unit (ICU), while his daughter is still unconscious. “We are waiting for Chaitra to gain consciousness to record her statement about the incident. Her father is not in a state to speak,” the DCP said.

Shivaraj, who owns the building, suffered a stroke a few years ago, which left him paralysed. He and his wife, Lakshmi, had shifted to Bengaluru from Huliyurdurga in Tumakuru district. Rangadhamaiah, who was from Chitradurga, had rented the house on the first floor six years ago. His wife died last year due to ill health. He sent his two children to his native place and stayed back in Bengaluru.

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan said that the government has not taken a decision to extend the tenure of the PSC rank lists expiring between April 2020 and March 2021, while rubbishing reports that they will be extended by a year.

He said that all department heads were given strict instructions to report vacancies as soon as they arise and hence there should not be a delay in the recruitments from the rank lists. If there are vacancies that are not reported to PSC, then there will be strict action against the department heads concerned. The administrative vigilance wing is monitoring the situation, said the chief minister.

He added that cybercrime experts are providing training to PSC officials to detect cybercrime when candidates use electronic equipment in exam halls. All measures have been taken to avoid any kind of unethical practices inside exam halls. Though no decision has been taken to install CCTV cameras in exam halls, the government is ensuring that exams are conducted in the most-transparent way.

Category change in ration cards

Food and civil supplies minister P Thilothaman said in the assembly that 39,068 card holders from the priority list haven’t purchased rations for three consecutive months. These people have been removed from the category and shifted to general cadre. More card holders, who have been removed from the priority lists, are from Thiruvananthapuram (6,040), Ernakulam (5,277), Palakkad (4,278), Kollam (4,235) and Alappuzha (3,270). The minister said the civil supplies corporation has already introduced an option to give up ration facility for six months and 917 cared holders have used this option.

Migrant populace

Vijayan said the government has not received reports that among the migrant labourers in state there are people from Bangladesh or other countries.

So washrooms are emerging as a safe space for scrolling through social media feeds without being disturbed.Pratibha Shah became worried when she noticed that her daughter (a student of Class X) was frequently going to the washroom and the duration of the trips was almost half an hour each time. She consulted a family physician and found that everything was normal with her daughter. “We later took her to the school counsellor to whom she confessed that she spent time in the washroom checking social media updates,” Shah said.The performance of a Class XI student registered a puzzling decline. When his parents started scolding him, he found solace in the washroom. His frequent washroom trips disturbed his parents. They finally found that his addiction to social media updates was the cause of the bathroom breaks.Harish Sanghvi, a parent of twins who study in Class XI, said: “All my efforts to check my children’s mobile usage went in vain. I even created a fake account to keep a check on their online activities.”Shivani Joshi, a counsellor, said, “Those who have tasted social media cannot forsake it easily.

NEW DELHI: Aam Aadmi Party bagging most of the Poorvanchali-dominated assembly constituencies has broken the myth about the migrants from eastern UP and Bihar voting en bloc for one particular party. BJP tried its level best to break into this numerically significant community by highlighting "" Poorvanchali asmita (pride)"", but managed to win only three seats.Most of these migrants, comprising around 40 lakh voters, live in the 1,700-odd unauthorised colonies in the capital. BJP had tried to woo them by offering ownership rights and regularisation of the colonies, but to no avail.Poorvanchalis play a key role in at least 27 assembly segments. The prime areas among the 24 seats that were won by AAP include Burari, Kirari, Sangam Vihar, Ambedkar Nagar and Uttam Nagar. The three BJP candidates who managed to withstand the ""Kejriwal storm"" are from Rohtas Nagar, Ghonda and Karawal Nagar.The fact that the victors got more than 50% vote share has proven that the Poorvanchali identity is no longer the only factor in play and these migrant communities are much more cosmopolitan than what they were credited for.Dinesh Mohaniya, who won from Sangam Vihar with 64.5% vote share, told TOI that BJP's rhetoric on Poorvanchalis failed and people from UP-Bihar voted for development, shunning regionalism.According to a Lokniti-CSDS 2015 survey, 55% of voters who were natives of Uttar Pradesh and 64% from Bihar and Jharkhand, the highest percentage among all communities, had voted for AAP in the 2015 polls.Ravi Ranjan, a political scientist from Zakir Hussain College, said, ""Compared with other groups, the community doesn't have a common identity marker based on caste, class or link with associations.

Political analysts pointed out that the saffron party's decision to go for polls under the leadership of Bhojpuri star Manoj Tiwari rested on the fact that he was an influential Poorvanchali face. BJP also ceded its seats to JDU and invited Bihar CM Nitish Kumar to rally for it during the campaign.

Political analysts pointed out that the saffron party's decision to go for polls under the leadership of Bhojpuri star Manoj Tiwari rested on the fact that he was an influential Poorvanchali face. BJP also ceded its seats to JDU and invited Bihar CM Nitish Kumar to rally for it during the campaign. Congress allied with RJD and made Kirti Azad its campaign chief.AAP, however, reaped rich dividends by offering the community basic amenities like water and sewer network, free electricity and subsidies, apart from more Chhath ghats.",elections,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74090951,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-102282,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//elections/assembly-elections/delhi/why-poorvanchali-card-failed-for-bjp-migrants-want-a-better-life/articleshow/74090913.cms

Coimbatore: The Tamil Nadu Vivasaigal Sangam (farmers’ association) has urged the Kerala and Tamil Nadu governments to allow farmers to take silt from the Walayar dam. While the TN government had permitted farmers to take silt from many tanks and rivers in the state, the Walayar dam on the Kerala-Tamil Nadu border has been off limits, they said.

During a general body meeting on Monday, the members of the association sought permission for farmers from in and around Madukkarai to take silt from the dam. “Farmers around the dam are into paddy cultivation. The crop needs healthy soil. Silt is extremely fertile soil and filled with rich minerals. If we mix silt in our soil, we don’t need to use any fertilizers,” said state secretary P Kandasamy.

Pointing out to a recent incident in which a revenue inspector ordered a village administrative officer to let go sand smugglers at Pongalur in Tirupur district, the association demanded strict action against sand smugglers and officials supporting them. “We seek action against six sand smugglers who were caught in the incident and corrupt officials who let them smuggle sand. We also seek protection to honest officers like the VAO,” Kandasamy said.

Farmers also welcomed a state government pilot project to update document registration in the revenue records computer system. “Earlier, after we registered a document, we would have to go to revenue offices and taluk offices to update the registration every time. We urge the government to implement the scheme across the state,” he added.

The entire project will be over in May, Shahjahanabad Redevelopment Corporation says

NEW DELHI: The first phase of the Chandni Chowk pedestrianisation will be completed by March 31 while the entire project will be over only by May-end, the latest project progress report submitted by Shahjahanabad Redevelopment Corporation (SRDC) has stated.

A committee comprising the managing director of SRDC and nodal officers from PWD, BSES, DJB, traffic police and DUSIB had recently inspected the project. The revised timelines were submitted to the Supreme Court-appointed monitoring committee, and the engineering wing was asked to increase the workforce to meet the new deadlines.

“Although the number of labourers working at the site has been increased subsequent to commencement of construction activity in December, but it is felt that there is still scope to increase resources considering the quantum of work to be completed. The superintendent engineer has been directed to increase resources, including labourers, with immediate effect,” the report stated.

The department is targeting to complete work in zones 2, 3 and 4 by March 31 while work in zone 1 and zone 5 will be completed by May 31. “Work is being done in phases. Barricading of zone 3 and zone 2 was carried out initially. Zone 3 is the central zone and zone 2 on the southern side is for non-motorised vehicles,” said an official.

The report also has a dedicated section on façade restoration. “It has been observed that unipoles and high-mast lights are yet to be removed from the streets and chowks. TV cables are also found hanging across the streets. Although the façade restoration is to be taken up in phase-II of the project, the air-conditioner units inside as well as outside the colonnade and signage boards installed on the shops need to be organised urgently,” it stated.

The deputy commissioner of City-Sadar Paharganj zone has been ordered to hold a meeting with the cable operators for removal of dangling open wires. Under the Chandni Chowk redevelopment project, PWD has put up huge barricades to restrict traffic movement on the main Chandni Chowk-Fatehpuri Masjid road. No motorised vehicle is allowed to ply on the stretch between 9am and 9pm. This has been done for the convenience of pedestrians.

Nagpur: When acting portrays the problems faced by the society, then it is not just expressions being displayed or manifestation of emotions, but propagation of the purpose of history to be scripted in the times to come,” said Vedprakash Mishra, chancellor of Krishna Institute of Medical Sciences at Dhanwate Hall, Shankar Nagar, on Sunday.

Speaking on actress Smita Patil, he said she was an inspiration for everyone due to her acting prowess and humanitarian gestures, though her life was short.

A book titled ‘Savitrichya Lekee’ was released in remembrance of Patil. Releasing the book, MP Dr Vikas Mahatme appreciated the efforts of those who strove to make ‘Smita Smriti’ special edition possible.

The central theme of the book revolves around Savitribai Phule. Every year, a special edition is brought out to pay tributes to Patil.

Mahatme said, “This programme is an effort to bring a change in the male-dominated society as it promotes the thought that women have the power to stand tall.”

Social worker Girish Gandhi gave a brief description about the programme and the book. He said, “Patil might not be the most beautiful actress in film industry, but she was extremely talented. It was her contribution as a social worker that separated her from others.”

The cover of the book, published by Ratna Publications, has been designed by Vivek Ranade. He was felicitated for designing the cover that resembles the life of Patil and giving justice to the theme.

Anchor Rekha Dandige Ghiya said, “The flower that has been shown on the cover depicts the message that it can bloom in any environment.”

Chief guests of the programme were senior journalist Hemant Joshi and renowned writer Arun Shevte.

Nilesh Khandekar proposed a vote of thanks.

JAIPUR: An 11-year-old boy hanged himself from a ceiling fan of his house in Muhana police station area on Monday evening. Sanjay Kumar was alone at home when the incident happened.

Muhana SHO Heeralal Saini said, “The child’s father died a few years ago and he stayed with his mother who works as a labourer. At the time of the incident, she had gone out for work. The boy locked the door from inside and hanged himself.”

The reason for the suicide is not known as police did not find any note. The officer added, “We found no suicide note in the house. At present, it is a complete mystery as to why such a young child would take his own life. We are questioning his mother as well but she is not able to give us any reason.”

The boy’s post-mortem was done and the body handed over to the family on Tuesday.

“It might be that the mother probably scolded the boy though till now there is no certainty as to what actually transpired before the incident. His mother is saying that no outward incident happened before the child’s death but that is not possible. Something has to have triggered for Sanjay to take such an extreme step,” said the official.

The child’s body was found when the mother returned home and could not open the door to the house as it was locked from inside. She called the neighbours and finally managed to get inside the house where she saw her son hanging from the ceiling. He was brought dead to the hospital.

Elaborating further, Saini said, “We rushed to the spot as soon as we received the information and are investigating further to ascertain the reason behind the suicide.”

Women from the city are calling the 181 Abhayam helpline to report both.Analysis of statistics for the women’s helpline for 2018 and 2019 reveal that neighbourhood issues have seen the greatest increase, rising by 48% from 2018. In absolute numbers, domestic violence, with 55% of total calls, remains at the top.“Two categories — neighbourhood issues and the reporting homeless girls or women — recorded increases higher than 25% in 2019. Complaints pertaining to extramarital affairs, 17 cases a week, witnessed a 25% rise,” said a senior official from EMRI, the agency that also runs the 108 emergency services.What kind of cases make up these neighbourhood troubles? “In a city such as Ahmedabad, eve-teasing by a neighbour, passing of comments while a woman or girl takes a specific road or suggestive language used by neighbours, are some of the examples,” said Falguni Patel, helpline coordinator.Cases relating to child custody issues are also increasing. “Such cases are seen more in couples having three or more years of married life. We try to intervene when the couple doesn’t listen to family members or try to shy away from their responsibilities. We don’t see more cases negatively, it means that there is greater awareness about women’s rights and a will to seek a resolution,” said an EMRI official.It’s also parents ringing up the helpline to try to get their teens off electronic gadgets. In August last year, a desperate mother called the counsellors after her 15-year-old girl refused to eat unless she was given her phone.

PATNA: Two persons, including an employee of a private firm, were shot dead by unidentified criminals in two separate incidents in the state capital on Tuesday. The deceased were identified as Chandan Kumar (32) of Mahuabagh and Sarfaraz of Sultanganj in Patna City.

Three bike-borne criminals fired at Chandan near a Shiva temple on Phulwarisharif-Jagdeo Path road under Airport police station around 10am when he along with his wife was on way from his Mahuabagh residence. Eyewitnesses said one bullet hit Chandan’s armpit and he lost control over his motorbike and fell on the ground. The assailants later pumped two more bullets into his body to ensure that he was dead.

His relative Rahul Kumar told the police that Chandan was rushed to the IGIMS where he was declared brought dead. He worked at a private firm in Patna City. The assailants threatened his wife Kusum Devi with dire consequences, but didn’t cause any harm to her.

Airport police station SHO Arun Kumar said the reason behind the murder was yet to be ascertained. “He used to drop his daughter to a school near Jagdeo Path before leaving for his office in Patna City. It seems the assailants were following him from his Mahuabagh residence,” an investigating officer said.

The police later recorded the statement of Kusum, who is under the supervision of a medical practitioner. Her health condition deteriorated soon after the incident. The body was handed over to the family after postmortem.

The second incident took place around 6.30pm on Gardanibagh Road number 25. Two youths riding a motorbike fired at Sarfaraz, causing him grievous injuries. He was rushed to the PMCH where he died during treatment. Gardanibagh police station SHO Arvind Kumar Gautam said the deceased was identified from an Aadhaar card recovered from his pocket. The reason behind the murder couldn’t be immediately known.

281,['12/02/2020'],Delhi: Lajpat Nagar-III parking plan yet to clear all bottlenecks,"This story is from February 12, 2020

Kamla Nagar is among the three places chosen for a pilot pedestrianisation and parking project

NEW DELHI: Lack of consensus between the residents and the municipal corporation seems to be delaying the parking area management plan in Lajpat Nagar-III . The area was among the three places, which were identified for implementing the project on a pilot basis in the city following the directions of the Supreme Court.

While East and North corporations have implemented the pedestrianisation and parking plans in Kamla Nagar and Krishna Nagar areas, respectively, South Delhi Municipal Corporation is struggling to enforce the plan.

Opposing the municipal corporation’s decisions to declare Nullah Road as ‘no parking zone,’ to tow away vehicles parked on internal lanes, and to impose penalty, the locals have written a letter to SDMC, traffic police as well as Environment Pollution Control Authority (EPCA).

“I fail to understand under which law the authorities have started towing away the residents’ cars. These vehicles were not even obstructing the free flow of traffic,” said Harvinder Singh, former RWA secretary.

EPCA member Sunita Narain said the Delhi maintenance and management of parking places rules, 2019 were notified and the corporation was working as per the project plan for Lajpat Nagar-III. SDMC deputy commissioner, Prem Shankar Jha, said, “We are taking steps to streamline parking. We will appreciate if residents also support us. We have installed bollards on Nullah Road, apart from 86 signage.” He added, “After the trial run, people have become familiar with the plan. The situation is improving day by day.”

The civic agency has designed stickers of three different colours to be issued to the local residents to distinguish their vehicles from those belonging to the rest. These are distributed with help of the local resident welfare associations.

Residents have, however, expressed reservations for paying Rs 1,000 for stickers. “We have asked EPCA to intervene and instruct SDMC or RWA to provide stickers free of cost to all residents,” added a resident.

SDMC officials, meanwhile, said they had nothing to do with the amount being charged for stickers. “The RWA probably plans to deploy guards at the two gates, which will open as part of the project,” said an official.

In Lajpat Nagar, signage of “no parking, residents’ parking, and visitors’ parking” have been installed at different sites. Nullah Road has been declared as “no-parking zone”. “We have seen some difference of late as people have started following the parking norms. Even Nullah Road, which used to remain cluttered earlier due to haphazard parking of vehicles, now remains free,” the official added.

Amanjeet Singh, president of Lajpat Nagar-III RWA, said the association had asked SDMC for some amendments. “No-parking zones at a few places force residents to park their vehicles 200 metres away from their houses.

KOCHI: A public interest litigation (PIL) has been filed before the high court for an order to install CCTV cameras with night vision and computerized weighbridges that are linked to a centralized monitoring system to prevent illegal quarrying in state.

During the admission hearing on February 17, a division bench comprising chief justice S Manikumar and justice Shaji P Chaly will consider the PIL (WP-C No. 3582/2020) filed by S Unnikrishnan of Thiruvananthapuram through advocate Kiran H.

The petitioner pointed out that though an e-governance system, named Kerala Online Mining Permit Awarding Services (KOMPAS), has been introduced for efficiency and transparency, it does not have the facility to check the quantity of minerals transported from quarries while issuing transit passes. This inability of KOMPAS is being exploited by quarry operators by illegally transporting minerals, causing a huge loss to the exchequer, the petition said.

Many other states have already made rules to prevent illegal transport of minerals, it said.

Panaji: Congress has accused the BJP government of delaying the notification on reservation for the zilla panchayat (ZP) elections in the state. This, they allege, is being done to allow the ruling party to manipulate the reservation of wards and delimitation in order to win the elections. Congress state president Girish Chodankar said that on a recent visit to the state election office, he was told that the file pertaining to the notification is with the chief minister.

“We will not allow BJP to conduct ZP elections on manipulated reservations. If they want, they can conduct it with the existing delimitation and existing reservation policy. We will only allow ascending, descending figures. They cannot pick and choose. It should be a uniform policy,” Chodankar told reporters on Tuesday.

“The ruling party is trying to reserve constituencies which Congress is strong in and trying to pressurise some of our candidates, even to the extent of threatening them to contest as independent candidates. We have already got these feelers from our candidates,” Chodankar alleged.

Stating that Congress has started preparing for ZP elections, he said the party may refrain from contesting in about five to eight constituencies where it feels its candidate is not strong enough to defeat the BJP one.

Jaipur: As pressure to repay installments of approximately Rs 1,600 crore is mounting, Jaipur Development Authority (JDA) has decided to prepare an action plan to sell its land.

Jaipur development commissioner T Ravikant on Tuesday gave instructions during a review meeting to auction new schemes after making alterations in the policy.

He asked the deputy commissioners to include replanning of the plots, fix auction rate, methodology of auction and wide publicity of JDA assets in the action plan. He stressed on the development of warehouse scheme on the land of Ring Road in Zone-11 and new plots on JDA land in Zone-9, 10, 11 and 14.

Ravikant asked the officials to send proposals for auction of plots in Patrakar Colony, Swarna Vihar, Khusar Extension residential schemes and Dravyavati River Project.

The JDC told in the meeting that hotel plots will be put up for auction on JDA land on Delhi Road through E-auction. He said the team formed for site visits of JDA plots will work 365 days actively.

The JDC said the deadline for depositing the outstanding lease amount to the zone deputy commissioners without interest has been extended till March 31, 2020. He instructed to make special efforts to prepare an action plan to recover the outstanding lease amount.

Sources said, “The JDA is desperate to earn revenue as it has to pay approximately Rs 30 crore installments against the loan taken from National Capital Regional Planning Board for Dravyawati River and Railway over-bridge.”

The JDA has taken loans totalling Rs 2,250 crore from NCRPB for the city's major projects. The JDA sought funds from the Centre for ROBs and the elevated road.

The JDA has also decided to earn revenue after transferring its land to Rajasthan State Industrial Development & Investment Corporation Ltd (RIICO). The civic body is expecting to earn Rs 122 crore by selling its land to industries after it transferred approximately 62 hectares in Bagru.

According to official, the decision was taken after the proposal received a nod from the Urban Development and Housing (UDH) minister Shanti Dhariwal.

Ahnmedabad: A special road show for US President Donald Trump is being planned all along the route to the Sabarmati Gandhi Ashram. The road show will feature a series of kiosks showcasing unique aspects of Indian states — including dances, food, and attire.

A similar show was organized for Japan PM Shinzo Abe during his visit to the city in September 2017, three months ahead of Gujarat elections. “The US president will most likely remain seated in his car called ‘The Beast’ during the road show,” said a senior state government official. “There will be a couple of security drills ahead of the Modi-Trump visit so that officials of the Prime Minister’s SPG and the US secret service achieve coordination.”

At the Gandhi Ashram, Modi will present a memento honouring Bapu to Trump. Modi will take Trump on a campus tour. A demonstration of the spinning wheel or the charkha is likely. US civil rights activist Dr Martin Luther King Jr and his wife had visited the ashram on March 1, 1959, and had even toured a few sites on the Dandi March route.

Kids perform at the event

Nagpur: Disability and age is not a barrier for people who choose to be happy. Children brought smiles to the faces of such people by energetically presenting dances, songs and a skit at Spandan Hall of The Home for Aged and Handicapped, Untkhana, to mark its 131st foundation day on Saturday.

SMMI sisters have been helping the abandoned, crippled, widows, unwed mothers and people afflicted with leprosy, TB, and other problems since many years. The foundation day was the time when children entertained and made them leave behind the problems they face.

The programme commenced with the lighting of a traditional lamp, followed by a prayer dance performed on the song ‘Teri jay ho Yeshu’.

Children won hearts of the audience by performing a dance on the song ‘Badal pe pao hai’ from the movie ‘Chak De’. The aim was to give a message that these kids can do wonders as they believe in themselves.

‘Nana-Nani’ of the institution and some children gave a performance on mash-up of songs that included ‘Sawaar lu’, ‘Manwa lage’ and ‘Aaja nachle’.

A skit was presented by children, highlighting the struggles of people who achieved the goals they had set despite being handicapped. The skit, titled ‘Hope of Life’, urged to reconsider the way they lead their life. They promoted the thought that there is always a hope to achieve something big in life if a person devotes time and energy for a purpose.

Various dance performances highlighted different cultures of India. Bihu, garba and Konkani cultures from Assam, Gujarat and Maharashtra were performed by children.

In his address, archbishop of Nagpur Diocese Elias Gonsalves said, “Stephen Hawking and Helen Keller are ideal examples for us as they did not let their disability stop them from achieving what they aimed for. People should strive to attain their goals with a positive approach, regardless of the problems they encounter.”

Social welfare officer of zilla parishad Sukeshini Telgote, who was the guest of honour, said these kids inspired her. “I believe that these children have the capability which should be emulated,” she added.

Professor and head of the paediatrics department of Government Medical College Dr Dipty Jain said, “If people have self-confidence, then no one can stop them from leading a happy and successful life.”

Sister Stella proposed a vote of thanks.

Ahmedabad: If your residential society is registered as a co-operative or a co-operative service society and if its office bearers have been demanding hefty fees to transfer shares against your membership, you should approach the district registrar for co-operatives (housing) against them. Recently, a resident of Kamalnayan Bungalows in Bopal dragged the society’s office bearers to the registrar’s office, after they demanded a Rs 3 lakh fee to transfer shares to the new owner’s name.

Gopinath Menon, the new owner of a bungalow in the society, was issued a legal notice by the society office bearers for not paying Rs 3 lakh for transfer of shares. District registrar Chetan Parmar says, “In the case of Kamalnayan Bungalows, the residential co-operative was registered as a ‘service society’ which has its own set of bylaws. In this case, members were only supposed to pay Rs 500 as ‘bakshish’ and a Rs 5 as ‘entrance fee’ to get the society’s shares to the owners name. Not a rupee more or less.”

Parmar issued a notice under Section 81 of the the Gujarat Co-Operative Societies Act, 1961, as to why an administrator should not take over from the society. Menon had been fighting the hefty charges since 2013, when he came to live in the bungalow. “I got the shares transferred to my name for Rs 505. I refused to pay Rs 3 lakh. I had a hard time convincing members of my society that what they were demanding was not acceptable and was against the society’s bylaws.”

Parmar further points out that if a residential society is registered as a ‘co-operative society’ where the assets of the residential complex — land, common amenities and housing units — are wholly owned by the co-operative society, then according to the Gujarat Co-Operative Societies Act, 1961 the society cannot charge more than Rs 50,000 as transfer fee as per 1991 and 2016 notifications. “The residential society registered as a ‘service society’ is only concerned with maintenance of common amenities and nothing else. Ownership of the property is with the buyer and the society is not supposed to charge Rs 50,000 as mandated in the Act for transfer fees.” Parmar adds that he get one or two such cases a month.

Jaipur: After a gap of a year, Jaipur Development Authority will organise camps to regularise colonies under Prithviraj Nagar (PRN) Scheme on Wednesday.

Initially, 19 camps will be set up at two separate locations at the community centre in Mansarovar and Chitrakoot stadium offices to regularise 15 colonies.

Officials said regularisation of these colonies will be done as per revised development rates.

JDA has set a target to issue lease deeds to all the PRN plot holders till November 2020. Residents, who will fail to procure lease deeds on time, will have to pay double development and regularisation rates to regularise their plots.

A deadline of June 30, 2020 has been set for the colonies in the PRN scheme which have already been regularised, but the plot owners have not procured the lease deeds.

For a 100 square-yard plot, JDA will charge Rs 300 regularisation charge (per square yard), which will include allotment rates. Similarly, for plot size between 101 and 300 square-yards, JDA will charge Rs 480. The agency will charge regularisation rates of Rs 720 (per square yard) for plots bigger than 301 square-yards and up to 1,000 square-yards.

Owners having a plot of more than 1000 square-yards will have to give 1.5 times regularisation charges. For regularising the marriage garden in the scheme, which has been developed on a plot size above 2,000 square-yard, the JDA has fixed Rs 1,500 (per square yard) regularisation charge.

Development charge for all the residential plots will be Rs 660 irrespective of the plot size. An official said the JDA will also regularise colonies which were developed after 1999 by farmers.

However, plots of the colony should be sold till 2012. Moreover, plots that are being used for commercial and institutional purpose will be regularised at the new rate fixed by the JDA.

Schemes, which have some portion in PRN, will also be regularised. All the plots of such colonies will be regularised at the prescribed rate of PRN.

Jodhpur: A team of technicians from Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) took blood samples of 81 employees of the Locust Warning Organisation (LWO) who have been engaged in anti-locust operations in the desert of Rajasthan for the past 9 months.

“A team of technicians of the DRDO remained in Jodhpur for two days and took blood samples of 81 employees to check if they did not have residue of the pesticide Organo-Phosphate, which has been sprayed to eliminate the swarms of locusts,” said the deputy director of LWO K L Gurjar.

He, however, claimed that it was a routine precautionary exercise and none of the employees has developed any negative impact of the chemical so far.

The team will take the samples along and test them to confirm if any of them has suffered any ill-effects of the pesticide.

“Based on the report, further steps will be taken and if required, medication would be provided to the affected ones,” Gurjar said.

According to medical practitioners, if the residues of this chemical, which is harmful for human beings, enter the body, it may result in paralysis, coma, vision-loss or memory loss.

It may be noted that on May 19 last year, the first swarm of locust had been reported in Rajasthan and since then over 3 lakh litres of the pesticide has been sprayed in the fields by the employees of LWO.

Nagpur: Emotions, visualization and impact that dramas have establish a beautiful relation with the audience. Each drama leaves a deep impression on the mind and heart of the viewers where language is not a barrier.

These feelings were expressed by the drama lovers attending the ongoing 21st Bharat Rang Mahotsav organized by National School of Drama (NSD), Delhi, at Sai Sabhagruh, Shankar Nagar. Performers from various states and countries offering diverse themes in their respective language have now become talk of the town.

Two plays in Bengali and Hindi, respectively, received tremendous response. The organizers are confident that artistes from the US and Russia too will continue the trend in the days to come.

Suraj Sharma, director in-charge of NSD, echoed similar thoughts and said multi-lingual plays will sure draw crowds as it is not the language but the acting that plays a major role in understanding the theme.

“Theatre that offers meaningful dramas attracts people from various walks of life, their position in the society notwithstanding. NSD brings out the best in actors. At the same time, it gives an opportunity to the audience to enjoy plays in different languages,” he said.

“We wanted to conduct this festival in Nagpur so that people from nearby districts can also enjoy quality theatre. People are waiting for the US play ‘Live Nukes’ by The Central Scrutinizers, and Russian ‘Djyrybyna, the warrior woman’ by The Olonkho Theatre, Russia,” Sharma said.

“We have selected these plays after a lot of consideration. We hold international film festival every year where we get entries from many countries. Both these plays would sure be loved by actors and spectators,” he added.

Vinod Indurkar, coordinator of the programme, said, “The weeklong festival is offering a potpourri of dramas. Not only are they different from one another in all the respects, they also reflect the culture of theatre. The style of acting and stage presentation from different states and countries will help people judge the dramas in true spirit.”

Hindi play ‘Kaal Yane Andhera’ was staged on the second day by a troupe from Ahmedabad. Bengali play ‘Laharir Rajhanso’ was highly appreciated.

Director of ‘Laharir Rajhanso’ Sekhar Samaddar said, “It was a great opportunity for us to stage a Bengali play. People here are warm and enjoyed the play to the fullest even though a majority of them did not understand the language. This proves the point that language is not a barrier.”

‘Magna Talyakathi’, written by Mahesh Elkunchwar, will be staged on February 15. Venkatesh Naik, director of the play, said, “The actors belong to Panaji. It is a rare opportunity for us to perform at Nagpur from where the playwright belongs. The presentation will definitely connect with the audience.”

Jaipur: Apart from developing facilities for organ donation and transplant, the health department is aiming to sensitise schoolchildren on the importance of organ donation from an early age.

The health department will write to education minister Govind Singh Dotasra to include a chapter on the importance of organ donation in school books.

“We are taking all possible measures to spread the message on importance of organ donation in the state. It is best to spread the message among children. These children will also sensitise their parents at homes,” said Dr Manish Sharma, consultant SOTTO.

The state government had initiated its cadaver organ donation programme by launching a website in December 2014 for registering patients suffering from end-stage organ diseases.

In the past five years, 35 families donated organs of their near and dear ones after they were declared brain dead while under going treatment at hospitals. All the donations were reported in Jaipur.

Apart from kidney and liver transplants, city-based doctors have performed five heart transplants. Though the cadaveric organ transplant has started showing results, but it requires impetus. For the purpose, the health department is taking initiative to make people more aware about organ donations, which could save lives of hundreds and thousands of patients suffering from end-stage organ diseases.

“The chapter on organ donation in school books will be helpful to boost the organ donation programme,” he said.

The chapter will have stories of those who donated organs and saved lives of others.

Dehradun: Protesting against the traffic restriction put on e-rickshaw movements during peak hours, an e-rickshaw owner Ravi Kumar attempted to immolate himself while burning effigy of the state government at Dharna Sthal here on Tuesday. He attempted to jump in the burning effigy after pouring petrol on his clothes. Kumar has been battling depressing since two months as he wasn’t earning enough to feed his family.

JAIPUR: The state government calls it Rajasthan Excise and Temperance Policy . But it hardly promotes temperance or moderation in alcohol consumption. Instead, the policy for 2020-21 seems to encourage extremeness or excess consumption.

The excise policy announced last week mandates government licenced retailers to sell 10% more liquor compared to last year. For example, total sales by the shops in the April-June quarter have to achieve 10% more growth compared the same quarter in 2019-20. As per the policy, if any shop fails to clock minimum 10% growth in sales, it will be penalised financially.

Similarly, sales targets have been set for bars in hotels, restaurants and beer-selling lounges. In every quarter, they have to report 5% growth in sales year-on-year, failing which they will be slapped monetary penalties.

“This is not only ironic but absurd. How can a government force its people to drink more alcohol? After making irrational expenditure by waiving off the farm loans, the government is taking some unsavory decisions to replenish its coffers,” said a hotelier preferring anonymity.

The government used to invite application for 1,000 Indian Made Foreign Liquor (IMFL) retail shops across the state. While in the new policy, the number of retail shops remains the same, the excise department has allowed Rajasthan Tourism Development Corporation (RTDC), Rajasthan State Beverages Corporation Ltd (RSBCL), and Rajasthan State Ganganagar Sugar Mills Ltd (RSGSM) to open retail shops.

The Raj Liquor Welfare Society said this decision that flies in the face of the temperance policy. Naresh Pareek, treasurer of the industry body said, “The government needs money but the long-term consequences of such decisions will be hard to contain.”

While the government has set a target of Rs 12,500-crore revenue target for the next financial year, many in the industry think it will be a difficult to achieve. “By raising prices of liquor, the government wants to reach the Rs 12,500-crore revenue target, but it is not possible. In neighboring Haryana, liquor is about 40% cheaper compared to Rajasthan. This will lead to bootlegging and revenue erosion for the government,” added Pareek.

302,['12/02/2020'],Horticulturists in Dhatwada to get free WRD water,"This story is from February 12, 2020

Ponda: With the water level in the Opa water treatment plant catchment area declining, the water resources department on Tuesday agreed to give water from its pipeline to the horticulture units along the banks of the Dhatwada-Usgao nullah for free.

A meeting between Dhatwada-Usgao locals and WRD officials at Sinchai Bhavan, Porvorim, on Tuesday resolved to give water to horticulturists as they used to draw water from the nullah previously. After laying the pipeline, they will not be able to draw it directly. The WRD has also agreed to return the river bed to its earlier condition after completion of the work. The department has been laying a 1,000mm pipeline for augmentation of water from the Ganjem water scheme on the Mhadei river to the Khandepar river.

Fearing that the land digging along the existing natural water nullah to lay a pipeline would destroy the underground natural water resources, a group of locals from Dhatwada-Usgao and surrounding areas in Ponda taluka stopped the work on the pipeline on February 1.

To end the dispute and allow work to resume, a meeting was convened in the office of superintending engineer Pramod Badami at Porvorim. Since the water level in Opa water works catchment area has been receding, the pipeline laying work needs to be expedited. Else pouring 35MLD water into the Khandepar won’t be possible, said a WRD official.

Opa water works complex that has five water treatment plants which collectively supply potable water to over 95% area of Ponda and Tiswadi talukas is entirely dependent on the water from the Khandepar river.

The Khandepar level dips every summer and the WRD gets water from different sources, including the 35MLD water plant in Ganjem.

Until last summer, the WRD used to pour the Ganjem water at the Dhaushirem nullah and water flowed towards the Khandepar. However, the entire quantity of water cannot reach the Khandepar due to loss in between by evaporation, ground seepage and drawings by horticulturists midway.

Nainital: Uttarakhand high court, on Tuesday, gave the state government two more weeks to respond to the Public Interest Litigation ( PIL ) challenging the order issued by the state government in November last year that had defined a deemed forest as a “patch of land with at least 10 hectares area and 65% canopy cover”. The court, meanwhile, also said that the stay put on the order will remain in force. The case was being heard by Justice Sudhanshu Dhulia and Justice Narayan Singh Dhanik.

“The state government wasn't ready with its response. Therefore, the court gave two more weeks but the HC took a stern view and said that if the government isn't ready with its counter in the given time, it will order the concerned secretary and the Principal Chief Conservator of Forests to be personally present in the court,” said Abhijay Negi, the lawyer appearing for the petitioners.

Earlier, a bench of Chief Justice Ramesh Ranganathan and Justice Alok Kumar Verma had stayed the order issued in December last year. Three petitions have been filed in the Uttarakhand high court challenging the government’s move so far. All these petitions have alleged that the entire move is aimed at benefiting the builders' lobby and land mafias in the state and will therefore damage the sensitive ecology of the Himalayas. The court clutched together these petitions which have been filed by environmental activists from Nainital and Dehradun .

KOCHI: Opposing the state budget proposal to levy tax on the school buses on the basis of number of seats, the Kerala CBSE School Management Association has written a to chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan requesting to take necessary steps for deleting the proposal.

The association’s president TPM Ibrahim Khan said that the proposal clearly discriminates the students of unaided CBSE/ICSE Schools, aided schools and government schools. The letter also requested the CM to provide them with an opportunity to substantiate their contentions at the earliest.

The letter said that at present, the schools are paying road tax of Rs 4,000 per year for each of their vehicles. The CBSE/ICSE schools are also rendering valuable services for providing education. Hence no tax can be imposed by the state government either for the school building or for the school transportation.

Bengaluru: From eco-friendly pens made out of old newspapers and stools fashioned out of plastic bottles to hi-tech garbage bins fitted with sensors, smart irrigation systems and vehicles that run on Acetylene ... Over 20 teams of students from city schools put on their thinking caps to design localised solutions for civic and environmental issues as part of the Bengaluru Civic Fest here on Tuesday.

Organised jointly by Bengaluru-based not-for-profit Janaagraha and Cisco , 25 solutions to a variety of topics were showcased on the concluding day of the event. Between August and December 2019, over 14,000 students of classes 6 to 12 from across India took part in the event through the IChangeMyCity Challenge portal co-created by Cisco. Of this, 25 projects were shortlisted to be showcased in the event.

Students of St Joseph’s Boys High School designed a ‘prototype alternative fuel’ made of acetylene, which they said is not only cost-effective but cleaner. Students of Kamala Bai Educational Institutions showcased a ‘smart irrigation system’ which aims to reduce water wastage and store rainater.

Idea from broken dustbin

Khushi K Patel, 16, from Srinidhi Public School said, “We got the idea to make eco-friendly dustbins out of unused newspapers when the waste bin in our class broke and we didn’t want to replace it with more plastic. Soon we realised that pens also contribute to most of the plastic being used in schools and we made eco-friendly pens from old newspapers.”

“In Bengaluru, buildings are located way too close to each other while many kitchens in smaller homes are tiny. There were two fire accidents in my locality itself last month,” said Syed Akbar, a student of class 9 at Blossom Public School whose team designed a low-cost fire extinguisher for homes.

Students of SJR Kengeri Public School designed a hi-tech dustbin which sends out alerts if garbage is not segregated at source.

Jaipur: The Rajasthan government has made an additional budgetary provision of Rs 10 crore for the financial year 2019-20 to meet a shortfall in the implementation of the Rajasthan Victim Compensation Scheme.

Chief minister Ashok Gehlot made the provision, approving a proposal of the Rajasthan State Legal Services Authority, an official statement said.

The proposal, pending with the state's Finance Department, had sought an additional budgetary provision for the scheme, it added.

State government had originally made a budgetary provision of Rs 18 crore for the year 2019-20 for the scheme, but the money had fallen short of meeting the demand for the compensation to various types of victims in the state.

Accordingly, the government earlier had made an additional provision of Rs 5 crores, but with the sum of Rs 23 crore too falling short of the requirement, the government had to make a fresh budgetary provision of Rs 10 crore, the statement said.

Out of the total budgetary provision of Rs 23 crores, Rs 22.77 crore has already been spent, it said.

The statement said the Rajasthan State Legal Services Authority has said in its proposal that applications for payment of over Rs 7 crore under the Victim Compensation Scheme were pending with it in various districts.

In view of such an immediate requirement, the chief minister approved an additional provision of Rs 10 crore under the scheme. PTI

Madurai: Madras high court on Tuesday constituted committees to prevent the flow of sewage water inside the Vaigai river stretch from Theni to Ramanathapuram districts, while hearing a batch of petitions with regard to restoration of water bodies in the southern districts.

During the previous hearing, the court had directed the revenue divisional officers (RDO) of Theni, Madurai, Sivaganga and Ramanathapuram districts to carry out inspections for taking remedial steps and also asked the officials to submit a report in this regard. Subsequently, RDOs of the concerned districts submitted reports with regard to the places where sewage water was being released inside the Vaigai river stretch on Tuesday. Taking cognizance of the reports, a division bench of Justices T Raja and B Pugalendhi observed that there are 13 vulnerable points where sewage water is flowing inside the Vaigai river in Madurai district.

A senior counsel who was appointed as amicus curiae by the court suggested that a team under the chairmanship of district collectors be formed in Theni, Madurai, Sivaganga and Ramanathapuram districts to prevent the flow of drainage water inside Vaigai river. Taking note of the suggestions, the judges constituted committees comprising the concerned district collector, corporation commissioner (for Madurai), RDOs, assistant director of town panchayat, assistant director of rural development, PWD superintending engineer of Periyar Vaigai Basin and regional director of municipal administration.

The judges directed the members of the committees to regularly monitor the banks of Vaigai by carrying out spot inspections and take steps to prevent sewage flow inside the river. The judges also directed the committee members to take action against people polluting the river under the existing provisions of IPC. The amicus curiae also pointed out that waste was obstructing the supply channel of Vandiyur tank and hindering the flow of water to the Vandiyur irrigation tank which extends up to 687 acres. Taking cognizance of the submissions, the judges directed the Madurai district collector, corporation commissioner and PWD superintending engineer of Periyar Vaigai Basin to take steps to desilt the supply channels of the tank. The case was posted to a further date for hearing.

311,['12/02/2020'],CU: Audit report reveals lapses in conduct of exams,"This story is from February 12, 2020

KOZHIKODE: The state audit department has found serious lapses on the part of Calicut University (CU) in the conduct of exams , including several instances of evaluators recording wrong marks in the facing sheet of answer sheet and allowing colleges to change internal marks that were already submitted.

The latest report (2017-18) found that CU was not maintaining a proper record of answer sheets distributed to colleges for conducting exams, which could lead to misuse. The report said CU allowed principals of affiliated colleges to correct internal marks of students after they were uploaded to the website in four instances. Permission was granted after the matter was examined by syndicate’s exam standing committee; which is a violation of varsity rules as per the report.

The audit wing also found that teachers, who evaluated answer sheets, entered wrong marks in the facing sheet seven times. The irregularity came to notice only when students applied for revaluation. In one instance, the marks recorded in the facing sheet were 37 while the one recorded in answer paper was 19.

The audit wing also found that the varsity had not taken any action against teachers responsible for missing answer sheets and certificates. The report said there were six instances of missing answer sheets during the audit year and no action was taken though 44 answer sheets and certificates were lost from Pareeksha Bhavan .

The audit wing has also pulled up CU for lapses in printing and distribution of answer sheets. It said CU is not properly maintaining records regarding distribution of blank answer sheets to colleges. It said that there were chances of excess answer sheets being provided to colleges, which could lead to misuse as proper count is not maintained.

“On inspection of Pareeksha Bhavan’s store, it was found that though CU had printed and kept the receipts which should be signed by the exam chief superintendent while receiving answer sheets, the signatures were not obtained,” it said.

Also, the report said CU was printing answer sheets in same series which creates loopholes for students to engage in malpractice and cited an instance too. The report asked CU to distribute answer sheets to colleges only after ascertaining the number of excess answer sheets held by them.

Audit wing found that colleges are not following rules governing the dispatch of answer sheets after exam to CU and were sending the bundles by wrapping them in paper instead of cloth bags and without categorizing them as per course/ code. The report said CU lacks a proper storage system in Pareeksha Bhavan for keeping answer sheets and often bundles are thrown down a staircase.

Syndicate member KK Haneefa said most issues highlighted in the report were true and a thorough modernization of exam wing is required. “Syndicate is trying to modernize the exam wing but several decisions taken couldn’t be implemented due to resistance from a section of employees,” he said.

Syndicate member Rasheed Ahammed said the lapses in conduct of exams can be avoided only if CU fixes individual responsibility and takes stringent action.

Despite the ‘no dumping of garbage’ sign, waste lies piled up at the front entrance of Junta House

PANAJI: Despite letters to the government, people with disabilities and those using wheelchairs still face difficulties when entering Junta House .

The building, located in the heart of Panaji , houses many government offices.

While the inside of the building is well equipped with ramps, sign boards and signages in Braille, the problem lies while entering the premises.

Mixed garbage , including carcasses of animals, is dumped right at the entrance for vehicles on the front side, making it not just inaccessible, but also unhygienic for those visiting the building.

TOI was witness to a wheelchair user’s inability to use this entrance/ exit due to the pile of garbage blocking it.

Ironically, the wall against which garbage has been dumped has a “No dumping of garbage here” sign painted on it. The situation, however, is far from being ‘swachh’ or accessible.

When asked about this, PWD executive engineer Vasant Nachinolkar said vendors have been instructed not to dump garbage at the building’s entrance. “We had cleared the pathway during at the time of elections. We have written to vendors not to dump garbage here and also requested CCP to lift the waste, but they haven’t done so. We will now have to resort to locking the gate,” he told TOI.

At the rear end of the building, meanwhile, despite it being reserved for parking for persons with disabilities, there is no direct access to the building for a wheelchair-bound person as small concrete barriers create hurdles.

At a drive conducted on October 2, 2019, the public works department (PWD) along with people with disabilities had cleared vegetation that had overrun a special pathway adjacent to the rear entrance.

Disability rights activists and wheelchair users have been writing to the PWD and the social welfare director/ commissioner for disabilities over the matter, but with little success.

Nashik: A section of Zilla Parishad (ZP) junior school students from Panzan village in Nandgaon taluka staged a morcha at the panchayat samiti office on Tuesday morning demanding more teachers in the school as their studies are not up to the mark.

The ZP junior school at Panzan village has classes from standard I and VII and children from the local village with a population of 1800 people. The agitating students backed by their irked parents protested with placards in Marathi marched to the panchayat samiti office and sat near the main entrance of the office raising slogans.

Some parents alleged that due to the shortage of teachers in the school, the students are busy playing in the fields rather than studying in the class. “This school needs at least seven teachers for the classes to run smoothly. In the absence of teachers, the students are at the receiving end. We want the ZP authorities to take note of this problem which the students of this school are facing for a long time,” demanded some aggrieved parents.

The local ZP education officer of Nandgaon taluka, N V Thoke confirmed that some students of that school had staged a dharna due to the paucity of teachers. “We will take up the issue with the senior ZP authorities and resolve the problem as fast as possible,” added Thokde.

The ZP education department sources said that the school has at present five sanctioned posts of teachers—three permanent and two temporary. “One post of the temporary teacher is vacant for a prolonged period. And the second post of the temporary teacher became vacant after October last year. It is not possible for the three teachers to take all classes,” said ZP sources.

Even the members of the local panchayat samiti said that the decision to appoint more teachers wrest with the ZP education department. “The panchayat samiti cannot do anything on this issue although the demands of the students are genuine,” commented some members of the samiti.

Mussoorie: The state tourism department plans to restore the house of Sir George Everest at Park Estate near Mussoorie as a heritage site. Tourism minister Satpal Maharaj said that the aim was to develop the place into a stargazing site.

Maharaj said that the renovation was being implemented with an outlay of Rs 23.71 crore. The project is expected to be completed by August this year.

The decision was taken at a programme organized by the tourism department on Tuesday at George Everest house. Details of restoration and renovation work were shared at the event. The tourism minister also distributed portable food vans to four local vendors, who own small stalls at the site and are set to lose business after the renovation.

“Our aim is to attract a large number of tourists from India as well as abroad to this site. The diary of Sir George Everest and equipment will be kept on display here,” Maharaj told media persons.

The project is being done with the collaboration of Asian Development Bank (ADB), informed RK Tiwari, additional director of ADB programme.

“We seek to develop an interpretation centre cum cartography museum, 10 huts for star-gazing with digitally guided star watching facilities, a mountain trail to a nearby peak, an audio-visual theatre, star gazing domes and an open-air amphitheatre,” Tiwari said. He added that the old house of Sir George Everest and his observatory would be restored as per its original shape and design.

Sir George Everest, who was the surveyor-general of India, measured the Great Meridional Arc from Kanyakumari to the Himalayas and after whom the world’s highest mountain peak (Mount Everest) is named, had the house and observatory in Park Estate from 1832 to 1843.

KOCHI: As increasing the use of energy-efficient LED bulbs and tube lights was one of the suggestions mentioned in the green audit conducted at Maharaja’s College to reduce its carbon footprint , the student volunteers of National Service Scheme (NSS) at the college are planning to make LED bulbs and tube lights on their own after procuring parts from the market.

Over 100 NSS volunteers will be part of the initiative and the college authorities are seeking funds from government agencies working in energy sector for the project.

The students have already trained in making LED bulbs by members from Rural Science & Technology Centre in Thuruthikara, a hamlet in Mulanthuruthy Panchayat , which was declared as the first e-waste-free and filament-free village. The parts and materials of the LED bulbs will be procured from the market and the students will assemble them.

“The NSS volunteers have taken part in the green audit to assist the team in surveying energy consumption and types of equipment used. A lot of bulbs and tube lights need to be replaced with LED ones. As the volunteers have practical experience in making LED bulbs, it will be easy for them to be part of the initiative. Though they have received training in making LED tube lights earlier, they have not made any yet. Hence, one more training session will be provided to them. We are waiting for the governing council’s decision,” said Julie Chandra, NSS programme officer, Maharaja’s College.

Earlier in December, the NSS volunteers had conducted a campaign ‘Filament-free Village’ in Pizhala in Kadamakudy Panchayat. The campaign aimed to replace filament bulbs with LED bulbs and around 600 LED bulbs they made were distributed in houses in Pizhala.

Nashik: A 52-year-old woman was cheated by her relative to the tune of Rs 3.6 lakh on the pretext of giving a job to her unemployed son in the Indian Navy .

According to a complaint received with the Nashik Road police station, the woman stayed with her husband, a retired government servant and her jobless son at Jail Road, Nashik Road. Their only source of income was her husband’s monthly pension.

In 2017, the woman was approached by her relative, who told her that her son-in-law was a teacher at a college in Igatpuri and had a good influence in the Indian Navy. The relative told the complainant that her son-in-law can arrange a job for her son.

A few days later, the aforesaid son-in-law and his wife came to the complainant’s house and informed them about the money that would be needed to secure the job in the Indian Navy.

The police said that the complainant woman ended up paying Rs 3.6 lakh between March 2017 and January 2020. However, her son was never offered a job in the Indian Navy. On the other hand, the said person sent fake examination letters to the complainant to reassure her that the process of getting the job was underway.

When she started asking specific questions related to the job to the concerned person, he started giving vague answers. Over a period of time, the women realised that she was being cheated following which she lodged a complaint with the Nashik Road police.

The police said that they were further investigating the case.

Poor show again: Congress office wears a deserted look after the results are announced

New Delhi: The once formidable party that held sway in Delhi for three terms, Congress failed to win a single seat for a second consecutive assembly election with its vote share plummeting further to a little over 4% and 63 of its 66 candidates losing security deposits. The outcome starkly brought out a severe organisational crisis, a disconnect with grassroots and the absence of credible leadership at state and national levels.

Congress finds itself in a situation where it is not a political presence of any consequence and is unlikely to recover any time soon. Among those who lost their deposits included heavyweights like former Delhi ministers Haroon Yusuf and A K Walia and former Rajya Sabha MP Parvez Hashmi, among others. The three who barely managed to save their deposits were Arvinder Singh Lovely (Gandhi Nagar), Devender Yadav (Badli) and Abhishek Dutt (Kasturba Nagar).

This is the same party that swept 52 out of 70 seats in 1998 and Sheila Dikshit formed the government. Dikshit had a remarkable run of 15 years till being felled in 2013 in what was seen to be a clear vote for change with the advent of AAP on the political scene though BJP was the single largest party. Congress has failed to find its bearings since.

The central leadership’s failure to steer the ship stands firmly established with state in-charge P C Chacko failing to even make a start. Dikshit’s demise, a poor campaign strategy and a dispiritedness, evident in the cursory engagement of Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, left the party stranded. The minority vote swung to AAP as did other sections once loyal to Congress. In the Lok Sabha polls, it was seen as a likely contender, perhaps as part of a coalition, to fight BJP. Congress’s tally of 52 settled that argument.

With Congress president Sonia Gandhi unwell, the only rally she was to address at Seelampur did not happen. While AAP has spread a net of volunteers and workers, Congress has not even retained its worker base. Moreover, the block level leadership has been directionless with frequent change of state chiefs since the 2013 debacle. The post of Delhi Congress chief has been held by Arvinder Singh Lovely, Ajay Maken, Sheila Dikshit and Subhash Chopra since then.

If the 2019 Lok Sabha elections were preceded by infighting with the anti-Dikshit lobby defying her, the late leader was herself reluctant to take on the role of PCC chief due to ill health. Under her, the party managed to better its vote share from a poor 9.7% in the 2015 Delhi assembly polls to 22.46% in Lok Sabha 2019. It came second and AAP third (18%) with BJP’s vote at 56.58%. Far from learning from mistakes and building the organisation, infighting seized Delhi Congress.

PANAJI: Goa Housing Board (GHB) has decided to develop three projects through private investment at Colvale, Davorlim and Xeldem. In all, 100 plots and 100 flats will be developed.

“We will develop three properties through a joint venture project,” chairman GHB Subhash Shirodkar told TOI.

Modalities about sharing the plots and flats between the private investor and GHB are being worked out Shirodkar said.

“It may be a 70:30 ratio, that is 70% of the plot or flats for the private player and the rest for GHB,” he added.

Shirodkar also said that GHB will have 15% reservation for people of the villages identified for developing properties. A similar reservation will also be forwarded to those residing in the respective talukas, he added.

Some projects will be taken up under the Prime Minister Awas Yojana (PMAY) for which the criteria will be separate, Shirodkar said.

GHB will also e-auction around 100 plots and apartments identified in most talukas across the state, including Bicholim, Ponda and Canacona, before Gudi Padava, on March 25.

The bidder criteria has been finalised, which includes a 15-year residence certificate and an income certificate, among others, and will be sent for government approval.

“By February end, promotion for these projects will start,” Shirdokar said.

GHB will ensure wide publicity for the projects so as to have maximum participation in the auctioning process.

Jaipur: A 22-year-old girl was killed and three others were injured when she lost control of the vehicle that she was driving and went straight into Ganda Nullah close to the CBI office in Ashok Nagar police station area late on Monday night.

The deceased was identified as Delhi-resident Ishani Sharma who was pursuing her postgraduation from the Vanasthali University in Tonk. The injured included another woman and two youths. The girl’s body was handed over to the family after autopsy on Tuesday.

“The accident occurred around 12am on the intervening night of Monday and Tuesday when Sharma lost control of the vehicle that swerved into the nullah. Due to the impact, her neck broke and she died on the spot. The other three passengers suffered injuries and after a long rescue operation were pulled out alive from the vehicle,” said an officer of the accident police station (south).

The reason behind the accident are yet to be confirmed, but police have not ruled out drunk driving and speeding.

“We will take blood samples from the injured to ascertain if they had consumed liquor. The injured are stable. We will question them further,” he added.

Sharma had come from Delhi to Jaipur on Monday and was touring the city along with her friends. “Sharma was with a friend who had come with her from Delhi. They met the youths in Jaipur and toured the city. They were out till late night and although the vehicle did not belong to Sharma, she was driving it at the time of accident. It is possible that the youths had consumed liquor because of which they asked the deceased to drive. We do not know if she was driving under the influence of alcohol,” police said.

322,['12/02/2020'],GMC morgue yet to start e-tagging bodies,"This story is from February 12, 2020

Panaji: The Goa Medical College’s proposal to introduce e-tagging for bodies in its morgue is pending for over a year now. The state’s premier hospital had announced the plan following the September 2018 Januz Gonsalves case.

A GMC official said the matter is pending with Goa Infrastructure Development Corporation (GSIDC), though the proposal was granted an administrative approval a while ago. He said that the GSIDC might have even finalised the agency.

The GSIDC, which is in-charge of the hospital’s maintenance, denied having any role to play in the matter. Managing director GSIDC Srinet Kotwale said that they have “nothing to do with selecting the body that will implement the e-tagging system for the GMC morgue”.

The official said the proposal might be pending on account of finances as the file is with the finance department. With no movement on the proposal, the hospital’s forensic department, at great risk, has reverted to its old system while handing over a body to the claimant, which was in practice prior to the Gonsalves incident and had been discontinued. The 2018 incident, when the wrong body was handed over to the Gonsalves family, had brought to fore loopholes in the system in practice at the time, the official said.

The system now involves maintaining proper entries when a body is received and handed over, including labelling and physical verification, but the staff tasked with the job are always worried that an error may occur, the official said.

“It would make the job of the forensic department less stressful and easier if bodies were to be e-tagged,” he said, adding that, in other states, hospitals appoint separate staff to handle receiving and handing over formalities.

The Gonsalves incident had led to the suspension of then head of the forensic department Edmund Rodrigues and two other staffers. The case was investigated by the crime branch.

Nagpur: A day before the daily hearing on a PIL seeking CBI probe in the alleged irrigation scam would begin, the state’s anti-corruption bureau’s ( ACB ) units at Nagpur and Amravati filed 14 offences in fresh cases on Wednesday. Work on registering an offence in yet another case is also under way, said sources.

This comes after the ACB had given a clean chit to deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar who had held the water resources portfolio in the last Congress-NCP regime.

For the first time, an offence has been registered against M/s SMS Infrastructure run by the prominent Sancheti family which has a major stake in irrigation contract business. Former BJP Rajya Sabha member Ajay Sancheti, also known to be close to Union transport minister Nitin Gadkari and Pawar as well, was once in the company’s management. He quit after becoming Rajya Sabha member around eight years ago. Rather the first complaint with the ACB that led to the whole probe was against SMS Infrastructure.

In most of the cases including that against SMS Infrastructure, the alleged crime mainly involves misrepresentation of facts by contractors or that of favouring them by Vidarbha Irrigation Development Corporation (VIDC) officials.

Nashik: The city police externed a 21-year-old criminal from the Satpur area on Tuesday on the backdrop of his criminal background.

The externed criminal is identified as Shankar Devram Kadale and resident of Swarbaba Nagar in the city.

The police said that Kadale had cases of house break-ins against him, there were also cases of extortion on the pretext of asking donations. His presence was putting people in his area under fear, which forced the police to extern from city limits and the district for a period of two years.

DCP (Zone II) Vijay Kharat said that all criminals, who have two or more cases registered against them within a period of five years are under their radar. The police are checking the present activities of such people and deciding on action against them.

On February 8, five criminals Ganesh Jadhav (24) of Satpur, Kalpesh Gunjal (23) of Gangapur, Sagar Kumavat (25) of Bhadrakali, Vishal Koli (38) of Adgaon and Wasim Abdul Rehman Shaikh (27) of Wadala Road were externed from the city for one and two years. On February 2, two criminals identified as Mujju alias Mujaffar Jarak Khan (23) of the Deolali Camp area and Popat Shankar Khade (42) of Prabuddha Nagar, Satpur were externed on the backdrop of their involvement in body and property offences.

The police said that the process of externing people with criminal records would continue even in the future.

Last year, the police externed 148 criminals from the city to ensure that the city remained peaceful during the election periods and also during the important festivals.

DCP (Zone 1) Amol Tambe said that the results were evident from the strict preventive measures they were taking against habitual criminals. He said that the most glaring example was that the elections and other festivals took place in the city without any untoward incident and at the same time the rate of murders in the city also reduced last year compared to its previous year.

Madurai: The Madras high court on Tuesday dismissed a review application seeking to restrain O Raja, brother of deputy chief minister O Panneerselvam from functioning as the chairman and 17 others as members of the interim board of the Theni District Milk Producers Cooperative Union.

A division bench of justice M Duraiswamy and justice T Ravindran dismissed the review application filed by V P Ammavasai, president of Palanichettipatti Primary Milk Cooperative Society in Theni district.

Earlier, Ammavasai had moved the high court Madurai bench challenging the appointment of Raja and 17 members of interim board of Theni union, citing that they were appointed by violating the provisions of the Tamil Nadu Cooperative Societies Act, 1983.

On January 23, a division bench observed that the authorities concerned have cited the wrong provision of the Act was cited in the order based on which the interim board was constituted. Hence, the court set aside the order of Theni deputy registrar dated August 26, 2019 which constituted the interim board and remitted back the matter to the authorities to pass orders with regard to constituting interim board or regular board in accordance with the Tamil Nadu Cooperative Societies Act, other rules and by-laws.

A week after the court had set aside the order, Raja took charge as the chairman along with the 17 members of the interim board of Theni union on January 30 in the presence of minister for milk and dairy development K T Rajenthra Bhalaji who said that necessary ‘legal corrections’ had been made to make the appointment valid.

The mood at Delhi BJP chief Manoj Tiwari’s office was sombre as the capital gave yet another thumbs up to Arvi... Read More

NEW DELHI: In the end, the 2020 Delhi assembly polls turned out to be Landslide 2.0 in favour of Aam Aadmi Party. And social scientists believe that the victory of Arvind Kejriwal will momentarily stem BJP’s raucous political rhetoric.

Complete coverage on Delhi elections

“The election result is good news for AAP, people of Delhi and India. If BJP had succeeded, then this vitriolic campaign of communal hatred would have become a standard template. We are saved from that. The victory has also put some brakes on the BJP steamroller, which is out to dismantle the republic,” said social scientist Yogendra Yadav, also a former member of AAP’s political affairs committee.

Rahul Verma of Centre for Policy Research said that there was now a template emerging to challenge BJP. “But the good news for BJP-Modi is that the template suggests that the parties have to be on the Centre-Right. None is taking them on over the question of religion and nationalism. In that sense, it is their ideological victory. It moves the fulcrum of ideological contest to Centre-Right,” he added.

“The voters are also making a distinction between state and the Centre. But how long and far needs to be seen. We have seen that since 2018, a segment of voters who support Modi and BJP during LS polls chose opposition parties during state elections. This is an emerging trend, but we don’t fully understand the reasons behind it. BJP is facing a difficult time holding on to states. They need to introspect on the strategy to retain or win states,” Verma said.

Political scientist Imtiaz Ahmad said it would be too early to say if Delhi represents a trend towards decline of Hindutva politics. “However, it is certain that things may not go smoothly for BJP in Bihar and West Bengal. Modi has opened too many fronts: Kashmir, CAA, NRC, and much would depend on what happens on these fronts. The ST and SC issue, too, will heat up soon. If Muslims, Dalits and Sikhs come together, Hindutva politics may run into difficulty,” Ahmad said.

Social scientists largely agreed that being able to offer welfare benefits to the common people was electorally beneficial for Kejriwal. Yadav, now Swaraj India Party president, said that the performance of the AAP government was “moderate” with “focus on some visible delivery, without paying much attention to the rest”.

But he also pointed out that “the formula has been used previously by Naveen Patnaik in Odisha, Nitish Kumar in Bihar, Modi when he was Gujarat CM and Raman Singh in Chhattisgarh. AAP also had a very powerful communication machine, a fairly-organised electoral machine and rode on a personality cult. Instead of changing the rules of the game, the new entrant has learnt the existing rules better than the older players.”

Verma said that AAP smartly steered clear from the ideological planks of BJP and kept the campaign very local. “BJP didn’t have a state-level leadership to match Kejriwal’s personality and charisma. And Kejriwal, for his own good, avoided a direct ‘personality’ contest with PM Modi,” he said.

“AAP could now be in a good position to make a comeback in Punjab, which is due for polls in 2022. If they manage to do so, they can emerge as an important pole at the national level,” he said.

NASHIK: The 46-year-old old woman, who had set herself ablaze in front of a police station on Monday evening, succumbed to the burns early on Tuesday morning.

The deceased woman was undergoing treatment at the Nashik Civil Hospital. She was taken to the hospital at around 7 pm by the police and her relatives. Medical officers at the hospital said the woman had suffered 90% burns.

Meanwhile, during the investigation, the police found that the woman had brought a bottle of petrol with her to the police station on Monday evening.

On realising that her newlywed 27-year-old daughter had no intention of returning to her husband or even staying with her parents, the woman decided to end her life near the police station.

The woman’s daughter had got married to a man from Raipur in Chhattisgarh on January 18. According to the daughter, her husband had started beating and abusing her within seven days of their wedding. The 27-year-old’s parents had also been to Raipur to resolve the problem. She was unhappy with her parents’ attitude as they were not supportive of her. She had left her husband’s house in Raipur and returned to Nashik a few days ago and was staying with her female friend.

Her parents were upset with her for leaving her husband and also for not coming home to stay with them. Therefore, on Monday the parents had gone to the police station. The police had also called the daughter to the police station for inquiry.

On realising that her daughter was neither interested in coming home nor did she want to return to her husband’s residence, the mother went out of the police station and set herself on fire. Her relatives and police doused the fire and took her to the civil hospital, where she died in less than 10 hours.

Mumbai: The BMC plans to spend over Rs 7 crore to set up a biodiversity facility on the first floor of the interpretation centre at Byculla zoo .

This includes the biodiversity found at Sanjay Gandhi National Park in Borivli, flamingos spotted on the eastern seafront, and even that within the 53-acre zoo premises itself, such as the butterfly park and the Japanese garden, among others.

Apart from other enclosures for animals such as hyenas that were recently brought into the zoo, those for foxes, jackals, leopards and pond turtles were also inaugurated. A pair of tigers is expected to arrive on Wednesday.

The work has been awarded to Highway Constructions—which had undertaken to build an enclosure for Humbodlt penguins. The contractor was penalized Rs 1.4 crore by the BMC after it was found that it had lied about a joint venture with a company with an expertise in the field of aquatic life support systems.

This is the second time after the controversy that the company has been awarded a work. In August 2019, the civic standing committee had given a green signal to appoint the same contractor for construction of 10 animal enclosures at the zoo at a cost of Rs 59 crore.

A BMC official, though, said the company was never blacklisted and therefore no action was taken.

Civic officials said there are plans to put up an exhibition first at the 11th World Wilderness Congress to be held in Jaipur in March.

After the expo, the same display would be brought to the interpretation centre premises.

“There are plans to have a video wall, an education gallery and also a signage giving out information about the city’s rich biodiversity, which sometimes goes unoticed,” said a civic official.

Kochi: Ernakulam coastal police have served a notice to the captain and owner of Hansa Prem, a tanker which faces arrest threat following a high court order, asking not to leave the Kerala coast until further order.

The notice was served by coastal police and the ‘daffedar’ from the HC on Tuesday. Colombo Dockyard PLC, a company functioning in Port of Colombo had filed a petition before the HC alleging that the vessel’s owner failed to pay an amount of Rs 78 lakh to the company for carrying out maintenance work.

Currently, the ship has been anchored near Kerala coast. The petitioner had urged the court to prevent the ship from leaving the Kerala coast until it deposits the amount in the court.

The Cochin Port expressed helplessness in arresting the ship since it has been anchored outside its jurisdiction. Subsequently, the court ordered the coastal police to arrest the ship.

The vessel, registered in Mumbai, reached Kerala to fill oil from BPPCL. The ship has been anchored at 13.5 nautical miles away from the coast. The state’s jurisdiction falls within 12 nautical miles from the coast. If the ship enters 12 nautical miles, the vessel has to pay rent to the Cochin Shipyard. To avoid paying rent, the ship has been anchored at the international channel.

331,['12/02/2020'],Maharaja’s College pledges to go ‘carbon-negative’,"The college has conducted a green audit to chalk out a strategy to achieve the goal

KOCHI: At a time when the concept of carbon-neutral campuses or campuses having a net zero carbon footprint is gaining momentum in the country, Maharaja’s College in the city has gone one step further by setting the goal of becoming a ‘carbon-negative’ campus . It means the college will remove more carbon than it emits each year. The college has conducted a green audit with the help of Integrated Rural Technology Centre (IRTC) and energy auditing firm, Ottotractions, in January to chalk out a strategy to achieve the goal.The audit, conducted with a long-term vision, with inspiration from the United Nations’ sustainable development goals, has found that the implementation of a few remedial measures can bring down the campus’s carbon footprint, the amount of greenhouse gases—primarily carbon dioxide—released into the atmosphere by a particular human activity a year.The 113-page report, accessed by TOI, said that the carbon footprint in the campus could be -22.26kg carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) per student per year in place of the current footprint of 6.81kg CO2e/student/year, which means the campus can achieve the ‘ carbon negative ’ status.With the works of the 70KW rooftop solar project in the campus, aimed at reducing carbon emission, in the final stage, the college authorities are now working on other energy efficient projects suggested in the audit report.“Conducting such an audit has been a longstanding plan and we finally decided to do it as the college is gearing up for another visit of the team from National Assessment and Accreditation Council (NAAC) in the coming months. The green audit measured the amount of the greenhouse gases (GHG) emissions within the campus as a result of its operations by accounting all the sources of GHGs and carbon sequestration. A detailed survey covering all departments, offices and canteen was conducted,” said PK Raveendran, chairman of Maharaja’s College governing council.K Jayakumar, the college principal, said the audit suggests carbon mitigation strategies in areas such as energy, transportation, waste minimization and carbon sequestration by trees. “The campus will be a model in how carbon mitigation should be implemented,” he said.As per the report, various carbon emitting activities such as consumption of energy, transportation and waste management leads to the total emission of 202.42 tCO2e (tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent) per year by the campus. The total carbon sequestration (a method of reducing the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere) by the trees in the campus is 98.62 tCO2e per year.The mitigation through renewable energy–biomass-based cooking and the upcoming solar project has been estimated at 87.14 tCO2 per year. Thus, the effective carbon footprint of the campus will be 16.66 tCO2e per year, which the difference of total carbon emission and total carbon sequestration/mitigation. As the campus has a total of 2,446 students, the specific carbon footprint per student per year is 6.81 kgCO2e/student/year.“The report proposes several energy-efficient projects like increasing renewable energy consumption, expanding green cover of the campus and use of LED lamps. Once these suggestions are implemented, it will mitigate 71.10 tCO2e per year and hence the effective carbon footprint will be -54.44 tCO2e/year/student. Thus, the specific carbon footprint per student per year will be reduced to -22.26 from the current 6.81kg CO2e/student/year,” said Sunish KS, a member of the governing council.",kochi,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74091946,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-373672,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/maharajas-college-pledges-to-go-carbon-negative/articleshow/74089289.cms

Chandigarh: Doctors at PGI were perplexed when a two-year-old child came to the hospital with a speech no one could comprehend. Examinations revealed the child was speaking Spanish. A seven-year-old child spoke about ghosts erupting from underground. In both the cases, cartoon shows on television had influenced the kids — watching too much of which is causing various problems, according to the ENT department at PGI that has been reporting more and more such cases of late.

“There are children coming to PGI owing to excessive screen time exposure, which affects their cognitive skills and speech,” said Dr Sanjay Munjal, ENT, PGI. Elaborating on the child who spoke Spanish, Dr N Banumathy from the department said, “After we cut down TV stimulation and asked the parents to devote more time, the child was able to communicate after a while.”

Doctors said to be able to speak, children need stimulation that comes from parental bonding. But when parents are working, children are left isolated with gadgets. “The exposure to screen time reduces the attention and slows down cognitive development. These children, if left untreated, end up with behavioural and other neurocognitive problems and autism,” said Dr Banumathy.

According to doctors commonly seeing gadgets affecting the learning and speech in children, parents are unware that these gizmos affect the development of children. “The parents, in fact, feel proud when their children are able to know many things about phones, gaming consoles and other such devices. But they do not know that besides cognitive development, it also affects their problem solving and motor skills,” said Dr Banumathy.

Mining in the state came to a halt on March 15, 2018

PANAJI: The Goa government told the Supreme Court that the mining leases can be extended to the year 2037 as per the mining companies’ contention— but that it would abide by the decision of the court.

Mining in the state came to a halt on March 15, 2018, after the apex court quashed the second renewal of the mining leases of 88 companies. Two mining companies have approached the court for extension of their mining leases till 2037.

“I submit that mining concessions which were converted into leases in the year 1987 are entitled to get the benefits under amended section 8A, and such mining leases are liable to be extended up to the year 2037. I say that in view of the directions of this court contained in the case— the state of Goa could not grant the extension, as claimed by the petitioners,” the state government said in its reply before the apex court. “The state of Goa shall abide by whatever decision may be passed by this Court,” the government stated in a reply filed in the mining case.

The 2015 amendment to section 8 A of the Mines and Minerals Development (MMDR) Act states that “all mining leases that were operational before the amendment came into force shall be deemed to have been granted for a period of fifty years”.

The government said that the two mining companies had made a representation to the state mines department contending that they are entitled to extend their mining leases up to 2037, as per the amendment.

The state government said that it is their contention that their mining concessions which were granted by the erstwhile Portuguese regime were converted into mining leases under the MMDR act with effect from the year 1987; consequently 50 years’ mining leases as contemplated under section 8 A would be extended upto the year 2037.

“The government of Goa could not accept the request of the petitioners in view of specific directions of this court (SC) in a judgement reported in the “Goa Foundation v/s Sesa Sterlite Limited case. ...in the said judgement, this court had cancelled 88 leases which were renewed by the government of Goa, including those of the petitioners herein. ....the court had directed execution of fresh leases ,” the government said.

NAGPUR: Two youngsters, Shaikh Zuber and Abhijeet Jangam , were killed after their bike collided with another two-wheeler on Central Avenue on Monday. Their friend, Shubham Wankhede , was injured in the incident. The three were riding triple-seat without helmets.

Jangam was carrying three puppies in a basket, to be delivered at some location. While two puppies went missing after the accident, one was found dead on the road divider. Zuber worked as a CCTV technician while Jangam was part of a catering team, police said.

Sources in Jangam’s family said his elder brother owns a business of dog breeding. His elder brother had asked Jangam to pick up three puppies from a fellow dog breeder, Akash Salpekar , based at Telephone Exchange Chowk. The puppies were to be handed over to someone near Itwari railway station.

Jangam had sought help from Zuber, and he had borrowed Wankhede’s bike, who also joined them for the trip. While Zuber was driving the bike, the other two were riding pillion.

The friends had already picked up the puppies and were heading towards Itwari railway station when their bike was hit by the two-wheeler of the culprit. It’s learnt the culprit came at a fast speed from Chitar Oli and rammed into the bike of the three friends.

Senior PI DB Bhosale of Kotwali police station said the victims were thrown off their bike and landed on the divider. “Zuber and Jangam sustained serious head injuries while Wankhede survived as he fell on the other side,” he said. “We know the biker who rammed the victim’s two-wheeler, and will register an offence of causing death due to negligence against him,” he said.

The victims were shifted to Mayo Hospital where the post mortem of Zuber and Jangam was performed. Wankhede too is admitted at Mayo Hospital.

NEW DELHI : In 38 constituencies, the total number of votes counted on the result day did not match the number of people who voted on February 8. A comparison of the figures used by the Election Commission to calculate the voters’ turnout with the final figures of the result day shows this discrepancy.Although in 26 of these 38 constituencies, the difference was less than 100 votes, it ranged from a little over 100 to more than 1,000 votes in the remaining 12. Of the 1.5 crore registered voters in Delhi, about 92.5 lakh or 62.6% voters exercised their rights. The votes were counted on Tuesday.The comparison of the turnout data shared by the Delhi election office on February 9 with the electronic voting machine (EVM) count in each candidate’s name and as NOTA revealed that in 16 constituencies, the number of counted votes was more than the number of people who were reported to have voted. For instance, the number of voters in central Delhi’s Karol Bagh on the day of polling was 1,07,184, but the EVM votes were 1,08,339 — a difference of 1,155. Similarly in Burari and Chandni Chowk , the votes counted were 464 and 396 more, respectively.In the 22 others, the number of votes counted was less than the number of people who were reported as having voted. In southeast Delhi’s Sangam Vihar , 1,17,463 voters were reported on the polling day, which was higher than 1,16,599 votes — a difference of 864 — counted on the result day. In Rohtas Nagar, 844 fewer votes were counted.However, the comparison of these discrepancies with the victory margins shows that these could not have impacted the final results in any assembly constituency.A Delhi election official said such discrepancies were not uncommon and sometimes the result of a particular EVM not being counted due to technical problems such as display issues or mock poll results not getting deleted. “The machine is kept aside and the remaining EVMs are counted. If the winning margin is big and the number of votes polled on that particular machine cannot impact the result, we do not count those votes,” said Ranbir Singh , chief electoral officer of Delhi.On a difference of just one or two votes in some constituencies, Singh said it could be due to typographical errors in the list of the polled votes compiled by the election office. The total number of people exercising their voting rights in a particular booth is recorded by the presiding officer in Form 17C in writing and manually fed into computers later, he pointed out. “The person entering the data into computer might have made some error,” Singh said.",delhi,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74109721,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-111059,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/counted-votes-dont-match-number-of-voters-in-38-seats/articleshow/74108097.cms

Arvind Kejriwal

NEW DELHI: Anti-corruption crusader Arvind Kejriwal , who has shaken up the entrenched political class of the country by returning with a thumping majority to form a government in Delhi for the third time, has himself transformed into a consummate politician in the past five years.

Complete coverage on Delhi elections

Kejriwal, the confrontationist, has metamorphosed into a flexible administrator who no longer complains about the Centre trying to stall his government’s work. He attributes that to a February 2019 SC order that finally settled the issue of separation of powers. He had, however, realised sometime back that targeting Narendra Modi could be counter-productive. Curtailing his national ambitions, he fought the election this time on the slogan, “Dilli mein to Kejriwal”, and said as much during campaigning.

Steering the entire campaign towards developmental issues, he adroitly sidestepped Shaheen Bagh — calling it just a law and order problem which home minister Amit Shah should fix — and defined nationalism as serving people. He told TOI that he and his party were “hardcore nationalists”. Unruffled by BJP functionaries calling him a “terrorist”, he reacted with injured innocence, asking whether a person who sent elders for pilgrimages and built schools for children could be described as a “terrorist”.

While BJP chief ministers, Union ministers and MPs mounted a big challenge to him, under the leadership of home minister Amit Shah, he took on the entire burden of campaigning for his party and smartly made the terrorist jibe thrown by MP Parvesh Sahib Singh boomerang on BJP by asking people to vote for the latter if they considered him to be a terrorist and vote for AAP if they believed he was their son. Delhiites have spoken!

However, leaving nothing to chance, he did a temple run in full camera glare and recited the Hanuman Chalisa on TV.

If Kejriwal has fended off attacks from the Centre and by various central agencies on himself and his party, he has also taken care to blunt any apparent challenge to his authority or questioning of his manner of functioning within the party. Kapil Mishra, Kumar Vishwas and Ashutosh were neutralised by him even as new leaders like Atishi Marlena and Raghav Chadha emerged with confidants Manish Sisodia and Jasmine Shah already in saddle.

On the way, swallowing his pride, he issued a string of apologies to Nitin Gadkari, Akali functionary Bikram Singh Majithia and Amit Sibal, Kapil Sibal’s son, for various controversial remarks that had landed him in trouble.

Kejriwal has addressed two criticisms that he and AAP have faced – that he is over-ambitious (aspiring for national prominence without doing local work) and addicted to dharnas. He appears to have scaled down his national ambitions and has not done any dharna since June 2018 when he sat at LG’s office for nine days with his cabinet colleagues for getting CCTV files cleared.

The 2015 election – when AAP won 67 out of 70 seats – was the result of a partnership for political change made by a few iron-willed individuals like Vishwas, social activist Yogendra Yadav and lawyer Prashant Bhushan besides others. The 2020 assembly election is about Kejriwal, Kejriwal and only Kejriwal.

Nashik: The Upnagar police arrested a 27-year-old man on the charge of killing his five-year-old son .

The suspect had allegedly hit the child with a wooden bat on January 31. Though the boy was taken to a hospital in Mumbai, he died during treatment on February 5.

The deceased boy has been identified as Aryan Bhimrao Khandare.

Sunil Rohakale, the senior police inspector of the Upnagar police station, said they have arrested the boy’s father Bhimrao Khandare. He was arrested following a complaint lodged by his wife.

The police said that in her statement, Aryan’s mother said that on January 31, at around 6 pm, her husband (Bhimrao Khandare) picked up an argument with her, questioning her character. As the couple’s argument escalated, Khandare started beating the complainant. That is when Aryan started crying and this annoyed Khandare. The father then struck the boy on the head with a wooden bat.

Rohakale said the boy had suffered internal head injuries from the blow. He was taken to the Nashik Civil Hospital for treatment. Since his condition was critical, he was referred to a government hospital in Mumbai for treatment. The parents then took the boy to the Mumbai hospital. However, the boy succumbed to the internal injuries on February 5 while undergoing treatment.

After the boy’s demise, his parents took his body to their native village in Hingoli distirct and performed the last rites. Subsequently, the couple returned to Nashik a few days back.

On Monday, the child’s mother, who was furious with her husband for causing the child’s death, went to the Upnagar police station and lodged a complaint against him.

The police said that they have arrested Bhimrao Khandare and are investigating the case.

Committee chairman VB Rajendra Prasad said an acre of land costs about Rs 20 crore in the area.

“Disregarding the Union government and the caution from several international agencies of its effect on foreign investments, the state government revised the already signed and sealed power purchase agreements. Why can’t they take the same stand on Karthikavanam project? The VMRDA leased out the 14-acre site to a private party for Rs 37,000 a year for 33 years in 2002. We came to know that the land has already changed two to three hands and there are now allegations of sharing the land between two parties,” said Prasad.

PANAJI: In a bid to lessen the volume of Mapusa-registered vehicles at the HSRP installation centre in Porvorim , the transport department has put a facility in place on the property of a private driving school at Cunchelim , around 4km from Mapusa.

The Mapusa-based Kranti Motor Driving School has a property at Cunchelim where candidates seeking driving licences are trained. A staff member said the space is now being used only for the installation of high security number plates.

“Considering the volume of vehicles, the vendor cannot keep giving out appointments (for fittings) when they well aware of their capacity. Based on output, we’ve saturated the HSRP fitting of vehicles registered in Mapusa at Cunchelim,” a transport official said.

Sources said most HSRP centres across the state complete an average of 100 fittings per day. The centre at Cunchelim, too, maintains 50 appointments in the morning and 50 in the afternoon.

“The staff at the facility ensures that people are not inconvenienced and stranded,” an official said.

Owing to the centre’s performance thus far, the transport department is contemplating an increase in the daily vehicle limit.

“We have been monitoring their performance. On most days, they are able to finish installations by around 5pm. We will advise them to increase the volume by 20 more vehicles in the morning session and an additional 20 vehicles in the afternoon,” the official said.

Earlier, vehicles from Panaji and Mapusa would get their HSRPs fitted at a common centre in Porvorim, which led to traffic congestion and long waiting periods on interior roads in the area. The centre serves vehicles from the Panaji and Mapusa jurisdictions.

With vehicles registered in Quepem — that share an installation centre with Margao vehicles — also facing a similar issue, a separate centre for them is going to begin shortly. “The process is almost at the end of the pipeline,” transport officials said.

BICHOLIM: Owners of several Mandoli banana plantations in Sal , Bicholim , who, along with paddy farmers, suffered major losses during last year’s floods, said they have not yet received financial assistance from the government.

Mandoli bananas are grown in certain parts of Bicholim and are sought during Ganesh Chaturthi. Several plantations were destroyed due to heavy rainfall and flooding just weeks before the festival last August, leaving farmers distressed.

“It is unfortunate that we have not yet received a single paisa from the government,” banana plantation owner Gurudas Desai, said. “We had spent a lot of money on the banana trees, supplements and material to protect them, but were shattered after many that had borne fruit were destroyed last year.”

Ashok Dhawaskar, another farmer, said although many politicians and bureaucrats had assured them of financial assistance before Ganesh Chaturthi last year, many are yet to receive funds. The farmers have now sought the intervention of chief minister Pramod Sawant and Bicholim MLA Rajesh Patnekar.

When contacted, Patnekar said he had already distributed funds to most banana plantation owners and that those who had not yet received assistance would be issued cheques before the code of conduct for the zilla panchayat elections was enforced. “But if the code is enforced by then, the amount will be directly credited to their respective bank accounts,” he said.

RUDRAPUR: A man was stabbed to death allegedly over a monetary dispute in Shiv Nagar colony of Transit Camp area in Rudrapur town of Udham Singh Nagar district late on Monday night. The deceased Govind Yadav (25) worked as an attendant in marriage functions. The accused was later arrested by the police. Two others were also hurt in the attack.

According to police, Laalman, a resident of Peeli Kothi at Chamunda Temple street, was at loggerheads with the deceased and his brother Rakesh Yadav over a monetary issue and had been picking up fights for quite some time.

In his complaint with the police, Rakesh said that Govind had gone out for a walk after dinner at 11 pm on Monday. A few moments later, he heard commotion and rushed outside where he saw Laalman sitting on Govind's chest and stabbing him with a knife . When Rakesh and his brother-in-law Jagdish Singh tried to save Govind, Laalman attacked them too and both of them received cuts on their hands. While the accused fled from the spot, Govind was rushed to the district hospital where he succumbed to injuries. Tension prevailed in the area after the murder.

VD Joshi, SHO of Transit Camp police station, said that the body has been sent for postmortem and the accused has been arrested. The official added that police team has been deployed in the area to avoid any untoward incident.

344,['12/02/2020'],Hotel site building plan nod cancelled,"This story is from February 12, 2020

Mohali: The Kharar municipal council (MC) has cancelled the building plan permission given to site of a hotel where a basement was being dug up beyond the permissible limit — an act that led to the collapse of an adjacent three-storied building in Sante Majra village on Kharar-Landran road here on February 8.

Both the sites are owned by the same builder.

Kharar sub-divisional magistrate (SDM) Himanshu Jain, who is also conducting a magisterial probe in the case, said, “The basement was dug up beyond the permissible limit, a clear violation of the building plan. As a second mobile tower was erected illegally atop the three-storied building, the builder-owner will have to get the three-storied building also cleared. Till the inquiry is pending and a final decision not taken, all types of construction activities at the site have been banned.”

The SDM said the builder had not taken any permission to erect the second mobile tower on the rooftop of the building which crashed. However, permission to erect first mobile tower was taken, he said.

Jain said, “We will also inspect other projects of the builder to detect violations. If found, action as per the law will be taken against the MC officer concerned. We are also getting the opinion of experts on the structure stability as well as ill-effects of digging beyond permissible limit. The exact cause of collapse of three-storied building is also being studied.”

He said the builder has constructed many housing and commercial projects in and around Kharar. All such parameters are being taken into consideration while probing the matter, the SDM said.

Preliminary report had found that the basement of the plot adjoining the three-storied building was dug up beyond the permissible limit, exposing the foundation of the building and leading to its collapse. The SDM said while the MC had sanctioned the building plan, the builder had not told the council of the digging of the basement —a mandatory practice. Four people had been trapped under the debris. Two were rescued within minutes and another late in the night. A JCB driver, Harvinder Singh, had been pulled out dead.

Nashik: An elderly woman who was missing from her Jail Road residence for over 10 days was found dead near her house on Tuesday. Her body was found wrapped in a gunny bag, said police.

The deceased has been identified as Mandakini Patil (62), said Upnagar police who have registered a case against an unidentified person.

Senior police inspector Sunil Rohakale said that as per the complaint lodged by the deceased’s 34-year-old son, Patil left her house at around 8am on February 1 and went to a shop. However, she did not return home.

On the same day at around 11pm, the woman’s son registered a missing complaint with the police.

At around 11am on February 11, residents staying near the Durga Mata temple complained of foul smell emanating from an open plot in Dhanraj Nagar. When they went to inspect the spot, they found a gunny bag with something stuffed inside it. They immediately informed the police who then carried the gunny bag to the Nashik civil hospital. Upon opening the bag, police found a woman’s corpse in it.

Police then called Patil’s son to identify the dead body. With the help of jewellery on the deceased’s body, her son identified her.

PI Rohakale said that the doctors found an injury mark on the deceased’s head which they suspect was made using a blunt object. Police said that they are investigating the case and will soon make arrests.

346,['12/02/2020'],School plea on validity of fee Act dismissed,"This story is from February 12, 2020

Jaipur: Rajasthan High Court on Tuesday dismissed a petition challenging the validity of Rajasthan Schools (Regulations of Fee) Act, 2016 by Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan’s Vidyashram, Jaipur, but gave liberty to the school to challenge the withdrawal of its NOC in the single bench.

The school had filed a petition seeking to declare the Act to be ultra vires which curtailed the freedom of private schools and also the withdrawal of NOC to the school. The court said the matter of validity of the Act has already been settled by the high court principal bench order. On the NOC, the school is at liberty to approach the single bench.

Lawyer for the students’ parents Dilip Gupta said, “More than 98% schools of the state have accepted the rules under the Rajasthan Schools (Regulations of Fee) Act, 2016. However, Vidhyashram refused to comply with it and filed a petition in the high court challenging it. Till the petition was pending, they were asking parents to deposit the fee that was hiked against the norms of the Act. Around 1,200 parents of students of the school had not deposited the fees since last October and after the decision of the high court, the school is expected to reduce the fees.”

School authorities were not available for comment.

As per the rules of the Act, private schools have to constitute a school level fees committee to determine the fees. The committee will consist of parents, teachers and members of the management.

The selection of the parents has to be done through lottery every year.

Gupta said Vidhiyashram School had not complied with this rule and had increased the fees without following the law.

Parents of students studying in the Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan's Vidyashram had gathered outside the school premises on Monday to oppose the fee hike. They accused the school authorities of threatening to debar their wards from sitting in the exam until the fees were paid, though matter is pending in the high court.

347,['12/02/2020'],"Onion prices stabilise, now sell at Rs 29/kg at state outlets, Rs 40/kg in retail market","This story is from February 12, 2020

Representative image

PANAJI: After burning a hole in the pockets of the common man for over three months, prices of onions have come down to Rs 29 per kg at the outlets run by the Goa State Horticulture Corporation Limited (GSHCL). In the retail market, the bulbs are selling anywhere between Rs 25 and 40, depending on the quality.

“Some onions are selling at Rs 25 per kg, but they’re of inferior quality. The Rs 40 per kg price is okay as it is inclusive of the suppliers’ transportation and supply costs. Most vegetable vendors in Panaji can make a good profit with this amount at the moment,” said vendor Aladdin Shaikh.

Towards the end of 2019, the Central government had to resort to importing onions from Turkey in a bid to tackle the shortage in the country. Some of these pink-hued bulbs, which were bigger in size and lighter in texture, were supplied to the Goan market, too. Though they evoked poor response initially, consumers were slowly starting to compromise with these.

“Turkish onions are now no longer being supplied owing to the rates of the Indian variant slowly stabilising,” a vendor from the Panaji municipal market said.

In a bid to meet the state’s demand for onions, GSHCL had also reached out to local farmers from Nashik and Solapur, procuring nearly 40 tonnes of the bulbs from these areas on a daily basis.

“Onion producing states were able to bring the rates down to only Rs 120 per kg, but we, despite being a non-onion state, managed to keep the rates lower than Rs 100 per kg. Only on two days in the entire duration of those three months, we sold onions for over Rs 100 per kg,” said GSHCL managing director, Sandeep Faldesai.

Following the stability in onion rates at GSHCL outlets, the corporation has connected these farmers with their licensed vegetable suppliers to distribute the produce.

“To maintain a healthy volume of supply, we must buy other items from Nashik, besides onions. For this, we need a supplier who will purchase various vegetables from the hundreds of farmers and supply them to GSHCL. We have given the contacts of those farmers to our suppliers from Belagavi, therefore. They will make purchases on our behalf,” Faldesai said.

Madurai: The death toll in the fire accident that took place on Monday in a temporary shed after petrol and diesel hoarded illegally, went up in flames, rose to two, after a 50-year-old man succumbed to injuries on Tuesday.

The victim has been identified as M Asaithambi, owner of the shed. Asaithambi, who suffered 90% burns, was admitted to the Government Rajaji Hospital along with R Vijayakumar, 35, A Karthick, 24, V Arumugam, 66, and R Ravi. P Ganesan, 40, died on the spot due to burn injuries.

The Thirumangalam Town police registered a case under IPC Section 304 (ii) – culpable homicide not amounting to murder and 285- negligent conduct with respect to fire or combustible matter.

According to police sources, Asaithambi was running a puncture shop on a roadside in a temporary shed made using tin sheets. He used the shed to hoard diesel and petrol, pilfered from trucks with the help of other state truck drivers, who carried the inflammable material from Kappalur IOCL terminal. He used to sell the fuel to others.

The others injured in the accident were his friends and workers. Police said the fire broke out after fire from the LPG stove, used by them to cook food, spread to the containers.

Visakhapatnam: A weather-proof artificial hockey turf and a synthetic athletic track of international standard, said to be the first of its kind in the state, is being built by the Eastern Naval Command ( ENC ) at its sports complex in the city.

Work on the two projects is nearing completion and are expected to be ready by March this year. Indian Navy is also planning to hold a triathlon race in collaboration with the state administration to boost sports tourism in Vizag.

“We are constructing an artificial hockey turf made of synthetic grass at the ENC sports complex. An Olympic standard synthetic athletic track is also coming up. Both will be weather-proof with standard dimensions. The synthetic hockey turf, which has been certified by the international hockey federation (FIH), will be the first of its kind in AP,” Captain Animesh Nagar, ENC sports officer, said.

Further, seeing the public response to the Vizag Navy Marathon, the popularity of which is increasing every year, the Navy is planning to start a triathlon event comprising running, cycling and swimming under various categories based on distance and time. Safe swimming zones will be demarcated for public to participate in the triathlon.

“For the annual triathlon, we will hold talks with the state administration, especially the police department, to collaborate with us. Organising such an athletic event annually will draw sports enthusiasts from across India and international participants too,” Nagar added.

350,['12/02/2020'],Monkey raids on plantations trigger coconut shortage in Goa,"This story is from February 12, 2020

Representative image

PANAJI: Lashed by heavy rains and plagued with monkey attacks this season, coconut plantations in Goa have faced a crop loss, owing to which there is a shortage of the nuts in the local market, experts said.

“Owing to the heavy rains last year, the flowering and fruiting of the crop has been affected, hitting coconut production. The crop currently available in the market is the produce harvested from the year before last,” said Sandeep Faldesai, managing director of the Goa state horticulture corporation limited.

While the corporation does not sell subsidised coconuts like other produce, the prices of the nuts are still lower at its outlets, when compared to retail rates. Currently, coconut rates vary from Rs 17 to 22 per piece at the horticulture outlets.

“The rates are not likely to stabilise until April. We expect a fresh harvest of coconuts in March, which may help tackle the shortage,” Faldesai said.

In the retail market, coconut prices vary from Rs 15 to 30 per piece, depending on size and quality— some of the biggest coconuts may even be sold at Rs 40.

“Coconuts are a staple in the Goan kitchen, used in most curries and desserts. Due to the demand, the prices are likely to increase further, if the supply does not stabilise,” vendors said.

Agriculture director Madhav Kelkar told TOI that some coconut plantations in Goa were infested with whitefly, a pest that has caused damage to the coconut palm’s leaves, but has not affected the crops’ yield.

He attributed the coconut shortage to animal attacks.

“In villages in Sattari taluka, coconut plantations are reeling under monkey attacks. The monkeys eat the tender coconuts even before maturity and then discard them— proving to be one of the major reasons for the crop loss. Due to the shortage triggered by the simian pests, there is a rise in coconut prices in the markets,” he said.

351,['12/02/2020'],"4.5L bags of paddy lie outside procurement centres, say farmers","This story is from February 12, 2020

Madurai: Farmers in Sivaganga district have demanded that the 4.5 lakh paddy bags stagnating in procurement centres in the district should be procured without further delay.

Tamil Nadu Farmers Association Sivaganga district president A Jayaraman said that the paddy has been stagnating throughout Sivanganga ever since they started harvesting early last month.

Paddy procurement centres are opened as required in the district by Tamil Nadu Civil Supplies Corporation which procures the produce from farmers in a decentralised manner.

He said that civil supplies officials had told them that 45 procurement centres had been opened in the unions in the district including Thirupuvanam, Ilayangudi, Kallal, Manamadurai, and Devakottai. It is not open on all days of the week as the workers and agents prefer to open and close them at their convenience.

He says that the 4.5 lakh paddy bags brought by the farmers are lying in the open outside the procurement centres because the procurement centres said they did not have adequate gunny bags to pack it.

They were told that the government had given 2,000 gunny bags to each procurement centre, but the requirement was about 10,000 bags per centre.

If the paddy is not packed and taken by the government immediately, it was in danger of getting spoilt or sprouting after the slightest drizzle.

Paddy brought to the centres from January 25 to 27 is still outside these centres without being procured, he said.

352,['12/02/2020'],City folk top in responding to ease of living survey,"This story is from February 12, 2020

Madurai: The city has in just 10 days crossed the targeted number of responses for the ease-of-living index and municipal performance index as part of the survey conducted by the ministry of housing and urban affairs for 100 smart cities and 14 cities with over a million population.

While 10,615 was the a target set for the city, as many as 14,093 people had registered their participation by Monday evening. In fact, the number of responses was far higher than in other bigger cities in the state. In all, 12 corporations are taking part in the survey in Tamil Nadu. Chennai has achieved only 11% of its target of 47,763 so far whereas Trichy has achieved 91% of its targeted 8,668 and Coimbatore, 72% of its target of 10, 919.

The ease of living index and municipal performance index were launched to assess the quality of life of citizens in smart cities. People have been asked to rate the city’s performance based on 24 parameters such as women’s safety, health services, affordability of health services, cleanliness, pollution, transportation and electricity services among other things.

Officials said that it was not just the participation, but even the kind of feedback given was overwhelming. Madurai has got good feedback in indicators like finance, technology, planning, sustainability and governance. The only indicator where it fared badly is in economic viability as the city does not offer many decent-paying jobs due to absence of industries.

Officials said that people who participate in the ease of living index assessment could stand a chance to win a cash prize of Rs 25,000. Government has decided to award 25 people from each of the 114 cities a cash prize of Rs 1,000 each and an opportunity to interact with the city mayor or commissioner on critical issues as a reward for taking their time off to participate in the survey . Out of this, 3 national winners will be awarded Rs 25,000 and felicitated at the 4th apex conference of smart cities to be held in Surat. All one has to do is to participate in the survey and share it and nominate 5 more people for participation, officials said.

353,['12/02/2020'],446 schools registered under RTE in district,"This story is from February 12, 2020

Nashik: A total of 446 schools across the district have registered for inducting students under the Right To Education ( RTE ) for the next academic year.

The registration of schools in the district began on January 21. The last date for registration was February 11. Parents who are interested to register their wards under RTE can apply online from February 12.

“As of now, there are 5,546 vacancies for RTE admissions in the district,” zilla parishad officials said.

The scheme was enacted in 2009 by the Parliament stating that 25% seats in schools must be reserved for children under RTE.

“A total of 9,225 schools have registered against 1,13,870 vacancies for students in 36 districts of the state. Parents will be able to register the wards under RTE from February 12 to February 29,” said sources.

A list of required documents is listed on the RTE website. The documents must be submitted at the ZP primary education office after online application.

The ZP had directed all schools in the district to update data of students studying under RTE online and the number of vacancies that would be available in the next academic year. The students, who had registered last year, will be automatically registered this year too.

The idea of compulsory and free education to all is being implemented under RTE.

As per the regulations, students whose family earnings are Rs 3.5 lakh or less can apply for seats under the RTE Act. Orphans, children with special needs, children of migrant workers and children of street workers, too, are eligible for admission under the RTE Act.

The age group specified under RTE act is between three to five years. The students can either be admitted to Junior Preparatory Kindergarten or to Grade 1. A student once admitted can stay in the school under the RTE provision until he completes Grade 8.

Backed by its huge mandate, AAP may be able to work unfettered now since the issue of separation of powers has... Read More

NEW DELHI: “Bahut saare kaam kiye hain paanch saal mein, agle paanch saal mein bahut saare kaam karne baaki hain (We have done a lot of work in five years and a lot of work remains to be done in the next five years,” chief minister Arvind Kejriwal had said at a rally in northeast Delhi’s Babarpur area less than a fortnight ago. Kejriwal’s to-do list included promises like better sanitation, free travel for students, mohalla marshals and a promise of finishing unfinished business – more buses, cleaning of Yamuna and battling pollution.

Backed by its huge mandate, AAP may be able to work unfettered now since the issue of separation of powers has been resolved. While the new government will have to expand on gains made in priority sectors like education , environment and water delivery, improvement in road infrastructure, development of a road network and getting the corporations to do their job better have also been promised.

Reducing air pollution remains top priority. In the past five years, the forest department has claimed to have planted over 1 crore trees with AAP claiming 25% reduction in PM levels. The target has now been revised to 2 crore trees and reduction in pollution to a third.

Kejriwal has promised that he will take a dip in the Yamuna in the next five years. Delivery on this key issue which has emotional resonance will depend on how fast work on the interceptor sewer system is completed and the four main nullahs pumping raw sewage into the river are tapped. AAP will also have to work closely with the central government on setting up new sewage treatment plants and in developing the Yamuna riverfront, a promise reiterated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi at a poll rally in Dwarka.

Sanitation is another area that Kejriwal has identified for special attention. He has said the city will be freed from garbage heaps and debris. This will require not only resolving funding issues with the corporations but also recruiting more sanitation workers. Kejriwal told TOI that he was willing to give the corporations funds for specific projects, opening a small window for cooperation with them.

Transport is one sector where the AAP government’s performance has been less than satisfactory. It couldn’t fulfill its manifesto promise of bringing 5,000 buses because of one problem or other. Buses started arriving only from August last year and more are expected to hit the road this year.

Many city roads are also in a bad shape and AAP has promised changing “Delhi roads into world-class roads” with a target of 40 km to be redesigned within a year. The same had been promised in 2015 and this time it needs to be implemented seriously.

In-situ rehabilitation of slum-dwellers might take off in this term. AAP has also promised regularisation and registry of unauthorised colonies apart from full ownership rights with freehold status for residents of resettlement colonies.

Reforming the education sector has been one of the key priority areas for the AAP government. It gradually increased funding for education to over 25% of the state budget. AAP has promises world class education facilities for every child. Experts have pointed out that while the focus of the first tenure was on improving infrastructure and developing a base, AAP will now have to improve human resources and recruit teachers besides giving some attention to higher education.

AAP’s unique free lifeline water scheme of providing 20,000 litres of water has been a hit and now the party has scaled up the goal to “24-hour drinkable water supply”. Not only will implementation require expansion of ‘water-supply lines in remaining unauthorised colonies and JJ clusters but also significantly scaling up raw water availability by using alternative methods.”

355,['12/02/2020'],Around 700 fewer RTE seats this year in Nagpur,"This story is from February 12, 2020

NAGPUR: There will be 700 fewer seats available in the RTE pool this year in Nagpur district as per data available after the last date for school registrations ended on Monday. No specific reason could be cited for the drop by education department but it does seem that low enrolment has forced schools to lower intake capacity, while a few may have not registered in protest against pending RTE fee. This fall in available seats will not affect admissions, as last year 50% of the RTE seats remained vacant in Nagpur.

Though many schools have boycotted the registration process, the education department does have an over-ride function in the online software wherein their data is automatically filled. For this, the algorithm looks at previous year’s data and populates the current year’s registration forms and completes the registration process.

Education activist Shahid Sharif , who focuses on RTE, said, “One thing is clear, that there is no communication happening between the education department and schools. For schools, the boycott is related to their huge pending bills, though some amount has been released recently. But what this entire fiasco means is that students are not getting their rightful due.”

Rajendra Dayma, president of Independent English Schools Association (IESA), said, “Let them auto register us because it will not have any effect on our resolve to boycott the process. After the online lottery parents will have to come to the school to complete formalities, and then we will expose the farce being carried out by the education department.”

He added that every parent will get a detailed letter about their RTE boycott. “In that letter it will be mentioned clearly that admissions can’t happen as we never agreed to our school’s name being put in the database,” said Dayma.

IESA is now planning a statewide awareness campaign about their RTE boycott. Dayma said, “Next week, we will be in Nagpur for a press conference, following which we will leave for other cities across the state. People need to be made aware of the injustice being meted out to private schools.”

NEW DELHI: Aam Aadmi Party’s successful poll campaign was notable for its clear and direct communication. They canvassed door-to-door to connect with every household and discussed the government’s performance with people in a series of town hall gatherings. While the party’s ‘guarantee card’ assured voters that welfare schemes for free electricity and water would continue, a catchy campaign song, and effective use of photos, videos and memes gave it an edge on social media.The party returned its pitch soon after its rout in last year’s Lok Sabha polls. ‘Dilli Mein To Kejriwal’ became its new slogan and CM Arvind Kejriwal said those who voted for the BJP in the LS polls would vote for AAP in Delhi. The government itself seemed to be in campaign mode since then, announcing freebies, such as 200 units of electricity, bus rides for women, free electricity for tenants and free sewer connections.The ‘Kejriwal Phir Se’ campaign launched in November recruited volunteers to take ‘Kejriwal Ka Report Card’ to 35 lakh households. It kept the focus on the government’s free schemes, besides its performance in the education and health sectors. Kejriwal himself answered people’s questions at more than 20 townhalls, showing himself to be a leader who doesn’t shy away from directly engaging with the public.When BJP tried to puncture AAP’s campaign by claiming the schemes for free electricity, water, public transport for women and pilgrimage for senior citizens were only for the current financial year, the government released a 10-point guarantee card—separate from the party manifesto that was released later—to quell people’s doubts about the schemes. Kejriwal, in fact, turned BJP’s silence on continuing his government’s free schemes to his advantage. He stressed in rallies that all the free schemes would stop if BJP came to office.

6,000 autorickshaws registered with STA

CHANDIGARH: At a time when the administration has stopped registration of petrol, diesel, CNG and LPG auto-rickshaws and is approving only e-rickshaws in a bid to check pollution and promote e-vehicles, as many as 1,000 CNG autos each from Chandigarh, Haryana and Punjab will be allowed to ply in the Tricity on a reciprocal basis.The decision was taken in a meeting on the Tricity’s transport issues held under the chairmanship of UT adviser Manoj Parida on Tuesday. On allowing CNG autos, Parida said “such green vehicles” will be encouraged. He said the three authorities will share the data of the autos for police checking. Chandigarh has requested the Haryana government to open more CNG pumps in Panchkula to reduce the number of autos at pumps in the city, Parida said.According to the current agreement, the UT and Mohali allow only 500 autos each from both sides. Only 500 autos of Chandigarh registered with the Mohali administration can ply in Mohali. Likewise, the same number of autos of Mohali registered with Chandigarh can enter the city. However, autos bearing Haryana registration number are not allowed to enter Chandigarh for commercial and business purposes.The administration had recently submitted its action plan to the central government to control pollution. The UT had said it has already launched an extensive drive against polluting vehicles and prepared a plan to widen roads and improve infrastructure to decongest roads.The ministry road transport and highways had suggested initiatives to promote electric vehicles, like waiving of toll charges and parking charges for them and issuing green registration number plates. The government has already framed a National Electric Mobility Mission Plan, aiming at promoting hybrid and electric vehicles in the country.A senior official of the State Transport Authority (STA) confirmed the UT is not registering petrol, diesel, CNG and LPG autos and only e-rickshaws.At present, there are 6,000 autos registered with the STA. The STA renews registration of autos only after fitness inspection mandatory after every two years. Every auto owner has to renew the vehicle’s permit after every five years at a cost of Rs 5,000. A sum of Rs 300 is the fitness inspection fee after every two years for the first eight years and then after every year for the next seven years. An auto can run on the roads in Chandigarh for a maximum period of 15 years.According to the administration, a maximum of 6,000 autos registered with the STA can ply on Chandigarh roads. At present, nearly 3,000 autos are eligible for running in Chandigarh as others have not renewed their fitness inspection certificates and permits. A majority of them, who did not come for renewal of fitness inspection certificates and permits, were diesel-operated autos.Other officials present in the meeting included A K Singla, secretary, transport, Chandigarh; K Shiva Prasad, principal secretary, transport, Punjab; Umashanker, additional secretary, transport, Chandigarh; Shashank Anand, SSP (traffic), UT.",chandigarh,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74091388,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-643124,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/not-more-than-3000-cng-autos-can-move-in-tricity/articleshow/74089322.cms

Portugal president Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa

PANAJI: Portugal president Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa will visit Goa on February 15 and 16, primarily for signing a contract between a Portuguese government body and the Goa PWD. The contract is to transfer Portugal’s expertise in water and sewerage management systems and technologies to Goa.

Sources said that the protocol department of the state government held a meeting on Tuesday to review the arrangements for Sousa’s visit.

While the contract will be signed at a private hotel in Dona Paula on February 15, Sousa will be visiting the churches in Old Goa on February 16, before flying out of the state.

Sources said that talks are also on for possible exchange of MoUs between Portuguese government bodies and NCAOR, NIO and Goa Shipyard for various programmes.

Governor Satya Pal Malik may also host a dinner for Sousa, sources said.

This is the Portuguese president’s first visit to Goa and it is part of a longer visit to the country, where Sousa’s first stop will be Delhi.

In September 2018, the state government entered into an MoU with a Portuguese government agency, which was meant to help Goa transit to technologically advanced systems to improve its water management and sewage treatment facilities. But the contract was never inked. This contract will finally be signed now more than a year later between the Goa government and the body in Portugal.

The estimated cost the state government needs to shell out as part of the contract is Rs 4 crore.

CLEARED SKHER

Nashik: The health department has been able to significantly cut down on the mother-to-child HIV transmission in Nashik district over the past five years.

According to the District AIDS Prevention and Control Unit (DAPCU), 46 of the 52 babies born to HIV positive mothers were detected with the virus in the year 2012-13. In comparison, just two of the 53 babies born to HIV positive mothers were detected with the virus in 2018-19.

The data has been gathered through 32 standalone integrated counselling and testing centres (ICTC) for HIV positive people in the district.

District programme officer of DAPCU, Yogesh Pardeshi, told TOI that timely detection of HIV in pregnant women and commencement of antiretroviral therapy (ART) has helped reduce the rate of transmission. He added that it is essential for the pregnant women to get themselves tested for HIV in the first trimester of their pregnancy.

“The tests related to HIV are performed on the babies at regular intervals six weeks after birth. The test after 18 months is considered final that determines whether the baby is infected with the virus or not,” added Pardeshi.

The authorities said that if proper treatment is taken by the mother during the pregnancy, the delivery and breastfeeding, the chances of HIV transmission are negative. “The reasons for children to get the virus is very late detection of HIV in the mother, late treatment and mixed feeding (mother’s milk and supplementary food),” Pardeshi added.

There are two ART centres in the district – one at the Nashik civil hospital and the other at the Malegaon general hospital. “The testing and treatment for HIV is free of cost in the public hospitals across the country. The only requirement is willingness to get tested. We declare the result of the blood test within 24 hours,” Pardeshi said.

SECUNDERABAD: Travelling from Secunderabad towards areas in Medchal limits has turned into a nightmare for students studying in various colleges on the outskirts of the city. The students claim that there are an insufficient number of buses plying on the routes.There are dozens of engineering and management colleges in Maisammaguda, Ghatkesar, Ibrahimpatnam and Bahadurpally. More than 500 students studying in colleges such as Malla Reddy College, Narasimha Reddy Engineering College, St. Peter’s Engineering College and St Martins College use RTC buses to reach their campuses every day. However, students rue that the number of buses plying on these routes are insufficient and their frequency is poor even during peak hours. Overcrowded RTC buses with students hanging out of the door with their feet on the footboard has become a common sight on buses plying on Secunderabad-Medchal routes.“Even though our classes conclude by 4 pm, we have to wait for atleast 30 minutes - 45 minutes before we find a bus that will take us back to Secunderabad. On most days, we have to board an overcrowded bus to reach our destination,” said Anil Kumar, a student.Students claim they are forced to take autorickshaws or cabs. “We end up spending more money if we miss the last bus. Autorickshaws and cabs charge up to Rs 150 to reach Secunderabad,” said Gayathri P. During the RTC strike, many students had also taken to social media to highlight their concerns to MAUD minister KT Rama Rao. “@KTRTRS sir, we students of @mallareddyformp colleges, Maisammaguda risking our lives by travelling in RTC buses daily from Secbad to Maisammaguda. Sir kindly increase the number of buses,” tweeted Pavan Maroju.Responding to the shortage of buses, Madhavi, Medchal depot manager said that there are five buses which run on these routes, making 20 trips every day. However, she admitted that the current fleet was insufficient for the commuters. “Beginning Wednesday, we will introduce metro shuttle services to these areas so that commuters apart from students can use them and the RTC buses can be used by the students who travel on these routes,” she added.",hyderabad,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74092944,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-213560,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/students-seek-more-buses-on-secbad-medchal-route/articleshow/74090284.cms

Madurai: The chief executive officer (CEO) of a city-based academy, which helps students get admission in educational institutions abroad, and three others were booked on charges of cheating a candidate who was enrolled in a medical institute in Ukraine without required approval, after collecting hefty money on the promise of getting him admission in an approved institute.

M Barathimohan, CEO of Nest Abroad Studies Academy in Kalavasal, a native of Cumbum in Theni district was booked along with his assistant Damodaran and two others - D Thirulogasundar from Ramanathapuram and S Harisudan from Udumalpet – who are running a hostel in Ukraine.

The city crime branch police booked them on Monday on charges of forgery and cheating based on a complaint from T Seenivasan, 53, from Melur. In his complaint, he stated that he had approached Barathimohan in 2016 for his son S Senthamizhdasan. In various instalments, he had paid Rs 21.50 lakh towards various charges including passport, institution and hostel fees. While he completed three years of education, they came to know that the institution is not approved by the Medical Council of India.

When he approached Barathimohan last year, he said that he can transfer his son to an approved institute and demanded more money. Although he paid it, the transfer did not happen. Two more candidates from Tamil Nadu P Vignesh and R Indrajith were also cheated by him. When the complainant questioned, the accused, cancelled the students’ visas without their knowledge, leaving them in the lurch.

The complainant approached the ministry of external affairs and paid a fee for visa cancellation to enable the students to return to India. Seenivasan had petitioned the Madurai city police commissioner S Davidson Devasirvatham and based on his instruction a case was registered by the sub-inspector of city crime branch P Kasirajan.

Chandigarh: A committee at the director level of transport departments of Chandigarh, Punjab and Haryana will look into the issues of entry fees of mobile app-based Uber and Ola taxi services, leading to cab drivers to call off their strike.

The decision was taken in a meeting held under the chairmanship of UT adviser Manoj Parida along with officials of transport departments of Chandigarh, Punjab and Haryana on Tuesday.

The committee will also take a call on uniform speed limits on the artery roads connecting to Chandigarh.

Earlier, there was deadlock between mobile app-based taxi services and their drivers over paying of entry tax in Chandigarh.

UT State Transport Authority (STA) secretary Harjeet Singh Sandhu said drivers have called off their strike. This issue was between drivers and companies and UT had nothing to do with it. Moreover, UT’s entry tax (Rs 11 per day) is very less as compared to Punjab’s Rs 240 per day and Haryana’s Rs 40 per day, he said.

On February 4, during a meeting with association of cab drivers, UT adviser Manoj Parida had stated that the pending government revenue has to be paid by cab drivers. He had said since the entry fee of Chandigarh was only Rs 3,33 per month, which was much cheaper than the neighbouring states, there should be no reason for objections.

In the meeting, it was decided that all stakeholders may be allowed to make payment of first two quarters of the current financial year by February 15 and the remaining by March 31. After this, a special drive will be started by the transport and traffic police to penalise the defaulters.

371,['12/02/2020'],"Pay Rs 7.10 lakh for child’s death at Krazy Castle, Haldiram’s told","This story is from February 12, 2020

Representative Image

NAGPUR: Nearly six years after a girl’s death due to alleged negligence at Krazy Castle amusement park, the additional district consumer disputes redressal forum directed its owner — Haldiram ’s managing director, park manager and toy train operator Prakash Patil — to jointly pay Rs 7.10 lakh compensation to her mother.

A bench comprising presiding member Smita Chandekar and Avinash Prabhune directed all the three respondents to pay Rs 5 lakh compensation with 9% interest from April 8, 2014, when the unfortunate incident took place. After holding them guilty of negligence and deficiency in services, the bench further asked respondents to pay Rs 2 lakh for mental and physical agony caused to the child’s mother and Rs 10,000 towards litigation cost.

“Citizens visit amusement parks for fun, enjoyment and relaxation from stress in day to day working. The tragic accident of complainant’s daughter was unfortunate and loss of a four-year-old can’t be equated and compensated in any monetary terms. The complainant suffered irreparable lifetime loss due to her child’s death,” the judges said while asking Haldiram’s and others to complete formalities within a month.

They said Rs5 lakh compensation claimed by complainant would provide some solace to her. “A mother’s sufferings, depression, trauma, and psychological problems faced after the accident can be well imagined. She is entitled to get reasonable compensation for the physical and mental agony,” they said.

Haldiram’s Kamal Agrawal, who was looking after the division that was handling Krazy Castle, told TOI that he wasn’t aware of any such verdict. “I am currently out of India, so can’t really comment on the verdict,” he said.

Complainant Nilofar Muhammed Kadar had gone to the Krazy Castle along with her two children on April 8, 2014. During a ride on caterpillar toy train, her daughter Sara had fallen down due to mishandling of machine by operator. Patil had failed to stop the train for three to four rounds even as the girl was shouting for help. Though the four-year-old had become unconscious, the Krazy Castle employees had failed to extend any medical help to her. The mother had managed to take her to Dr Ravi Dande Hospital, but she succumbed to her injuries by that time.

After her complainant at Ambazari police station, the respondents were booked under the relevant section of Indian Penal Code (IPC). Later, she knocked forum’s doors alleging all activities carried out at the park are illegal as the respondents failed to deploy trained persons for operating fun rides and also failed to maintain them.

While denying all allegations, Haldiram’s and its manager termed Kadar’s complaint as false. Stressing that all activities at the park were carried out with provisions of law and with trained staff, they contended that due care was taken of all visitors and safety instructions were displayed at all equipment. They pointed out that the complainant ignored instructions on the notice board and hence, her negligence, lethargic and casual attitude towards the children was the cause of accident.

Quoting post mortem report, the judges indicated that the cause of death was chest injury that give credence to mother’s contentions. “Looking into the deceased’s injuries clearly indicates that adequate protective measures were unavailable for the toy train ride. The respondents hadn’t made arrangements for handling such emergency situations, which established deficiency in services,” they said before partly allowing mother’s complaint.

What forum said

Adequate protective measures were unavailable for toy train ride

Respondents had no arrangements for handling emergency situations

Tragic accident of complainant’s daughter was very unfortunate

Mother suffered irreparable lifetime loss due to death of her child

Her loss old can’t be equated & compensated in any monetary terms

Her sufferings, depression, trauma, after accident can be well imagined

Arvind Kejriwal said that AAP’s victory is a good omen for the country.

NEW DELHI: After making a clean sweep of the election, chief minister-elect Arvind Kejriwal tried to sweep Delhiites off their feet too. In a victory speech that lasted less than seven minutes, Kejriwal said ‘I love you’ to the rapturous crowd and blew flying kisses, and got loud cheers in return.

Hundreds of supporters had gathered at AAP headquarters at Rouse Avenue where Kejriwal, flanked by Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Singh, political adviser to AAP Ashish Talwar, MLA-elect of Rajinder Nagar Raghav Chadha, and his wife Sunita Kejriwal and two children, raised slogans of Bharat Mata ki Jai, Inquilab Zindabad and Vande Mataram. They were all waiting for Manish Sisodia to come, and Kejriwal had indeed delayed making the speech. But when they learnt that Sisodia will take some time, Kejriwal went ahead.

“Dilli walon gajab kar diya aap logon ne (Delhiites, you did magic),” Kejriwal said right in the beginning, expressing his delight at having won such a massive mandate.

Calling the victory the dawn of a new era of politics, Kejriwal said, “This is the victory of every family in Delhi who treated me like their son. This is the victory of every family of Delhi that has started getting 24-hour electricity supply, whose children have started receiving quality education, and whose members have started getting good health services in hospitals of Delhi.”

Kejriwal also said that AAP’s victory is a good omen for the country. “This politics could drive the country to the 21st century. The people have given the message that they will only vote for those who will build schools, mohalla clinics, provide 24/7 power and cheap power and water, and build roads in colonies. This is not just the victory of the people of Delhi, this is the victory of Bharat Mata,” he said, amid slogans of Bharat Mata Ki Jai.

Kejriwal also gave some credit to divine intervention. “Today is Tuesday, the day of Lord Hanuman. We thank him for blessing us. And we wish on behalf of the people of Delhi that in the next five years He continues to show us the right path and help us make Delhi a fine city.”

He thanked all AAP workers and his family for their support. “It’s my wife’s birthday today. I had some cake and will share it with you all too,” Kejriwal said.

His wife, Sunita Kejriwal, later said that she couldn’t have asked for a better gift on her birthday than the massive mandate given by the people of Delhi. Sunita, a former IRS officer, said AAP’s campaigning saw several ups and downs but the party members had full faith in their work. “Delhi has made kaam (work) victorious,” Sunita said.

She also said that the personal attacks on her husband during the campaigning by his rivals were uncalled for. “Fight politics positively,” she said.

Kejriwal’s daughter, Harshita Kejriwal, had taken leave from office to campaign for the party. “There are many volunteers like me who have taken leave from work to work for the party. I will be joining back in March,” the 24-year-old IITian said.

Around 5.30pm, Kejriwal went to the famous Hanuman Temple near Connaught Place along with his family and Manish Sisodia, who had arrived at the party headquarters by then. People who had prior information about the visit thronged the temple premises to catch a glimpse of the victorious leader, who did no roadshow after victory this time and just drove down in his silver Innova.

People waved at Kejriwal from the barricades and some even climbed trees to do the same, all the time belting out AAP’s campaign song, ‘Achhe beete paanch saal, lagey raho Kejriwal’. Some people also waited inside the temple in the hope of shaking hands with the CM-elect while many waited patiently outside to greet him.

From the temple, Kejriwal went to the counting centre to collect his winning certificate from the New Delhi assembly seat.

377,['12/02/2020'],Hinganghat case accused twice attempted to attack Ankita earlier,"This story is from February 12, 2020

NAGPUR: Vikesh Nagrale , who is to be shifted to Nagpur Central Jail for security reasons, had made at least two failed attempts before finally managing to intercept Ankita Pisudde on February 3 and setting her afire near her college at Hinganghat for refusing to talk to him. Pisudde succumbed to burn injuries on February 10, triggering widespread agitations and outrage in the district.

Regional Forensic Science Laboratory (RFSL) has received instructions to fast-track the report on various exhibits sent by Hinganghat police, including samples of combustible liquid used to set Pisudde on fire.

The Special Investigation Team (SIT) preparing to file the charge sheet next week has come to know the sinister designs of Nagrale during custodial interrogation. Nagrale, who worked under a railway contractor, has admitted to police that he stalked Pisudde for the last couple of months, ever since she reported his advances on the bus from Daroda to Hinganghat to her father Arun. The father had berated Nagrale for disturbing his daughter and also vowed to approach the police next time he repeats the act.

Nagrale had been sent to Wardha district jail on February 8 by the judicial magistrate first class at Hinganghat after police opted to reserve their right to take him into remand custody on a later date for investigations. There is said to be a threat to Nagrale from other inmates, and also an apprehension that he might take some steps to harm himself due to his emotional state, despite dedicated security at Wardha jail.

Wardha jail authorities, considering the sensitivity of the case, approached JMFC Hinganghat to seek its permission to shift Nagrale to Nagpur Central Jail, where better and tighter security can be provided to him. The court has ordered Wardha jail authorities to seek permission of higher authorities citing jurisdictional issues.

Sources said Wardha jail had written to DIG, eastern region, Deepak Pandey for directions. Pandey has now ordered the shifting of Nagrale to Nagpur Central Jail with a note that strong security cover should be provided to ensure there is no harm to him.

It’s also learnt that Hinganghat police are set to record the statements of key eyewitnesses before the magistrate to ensure there is fool proof evidence during the trial against Nagrale.

Nashik: The Nashik Municipal Corporation ( NMC ) has decided to conduct a survey of all the service stations that wash vehicles to find out details pertaining to their water usage, the capacity of water tanks, electricity bills etc.

The civic body has decided to serve notices to the service stations that have not obtained no objection certificates (NOCs) from the Maharashtra Pollution Control Board (MPCB). It has also written to the groundwater survey department, seeking information on whether it is permissible to use borewell water for commercial purpose.

As per details available with the NMC, there are 276 service stations in the city — 91 in the Panchavati division,72 in Cidco, 35 in Nashik East, 28 each in Nashik Road and Satpur, and 22 in Nashik West division. Of these, 178 use water from borewells which the remaining use NMC-supplied water.

“We have written to the groundwater survey department of the state government, seeking clarity on policy regarding service stations. We have also urged the department to inform us whether the use of borewell water is permissible for commercial purposes,” said an NMC official.

“We have started conducting a survey of all the service stations to gather details like the total number of service stations in the city and the source of their water. The survey will focus on how much storage capacity these service stations have and how much water they use. We will also find out how do these service stations treat the used water,” added the official.

Notices will be served to all the services stations that have not taken requisite permissions.

Earlier, there was no special focus on service stations. But the NMC has now decided to conduct a survey to out a check on water wastage. After the survey, the civic body will also make a decision on the contaminated water generated by these service stations.

Panchkula: Parking is at a cost in three sectors (8, 9 and 10) from Tuesday. Red Cross Society and district child welfare department will manage the lots. The fee is Rs 5 for two-wheeler and Rs 10 for four-wheeler.

The deputy commissioner had written to the municipal commissioner that Red Cross and child welfare department were in money crisis and will be in a position to earn something if the MC lets them run paid parking. The commissioner gave them the charge of three sectors. Earlier, the MC’s own workers managed these lots and the civic body makes no revenue from it. The staff is withdrawn and the employees of the two institutions have taken over.

The MC has last introduced paid parking for two days in 2018 and withdrawn it in the face of a huge protest. The protesting residents and political parties told the corporation to first improve the parking lots. MC officials say they have taken the current initiative after making those improvements. The present parking lots have rain shelters and water points.

The department declared the junior-most teachers as surplus from three mediums of primary schools and higher primary schools. Some 255 teachers from Marathi medium, 33 from Hindi, 8 from Urdu mediums from primary schools, and 19 from higher primary schools are in the list.

Some 11 teachers, whose name were displayed in the list, registered objections claiming they were not in the surplus category.

On behalf of the teachers, Nagpur Mahanagarpalika Shikshak Sangh registered strong objections with Mundhe. “On one hand, NMC recruited 55 teachers on hourly basis and on the other it is declaring permanent teachers as surplus. It is unjust towards teachers. Many posts of headmasters in higher primary are vacant. NMC general body in 2015 had passed a resolution to open Balwadis and transfer excess teachers of primary schools to Balwadi . But NMC has done nothing and now declared teachers as surplus,” the union said.

President Rajesh Gavre said it was also unjust towards teachers to give only 24 hours for suggestions and objections. He requested the civic chief to give at least 15 days time.

NMC has also started the process to establish six English medium schools and recruit teachers on contractual basis for these schools.

On Gavre’s objections, Diwe said, “NMC does not have teachers for science, mathematics and English, so we are taking them on contractual basis. Teachers specialized in one subject cannot be transferred to another subject. How can we ask a teacher with graduation and teaching degree in arts to teach mathematics,” he questioned.

Diwe added the committee led by him had decided to send surplus teachers to state 18 months ago but the decision was not implemented. “Teachers should be prepared to take transfer out of NMC,” he said.

Opposing the move, BJP senior corporator Dayashankar Tiwari said surplus teachers should be adjusted in vacant posts in other departments in NMC. “Many posts in NMC are vacant and suitable for teachers,” he said.

Congress corporator Praful Gudadhe too opposed the move and said it appears to be a way to close down NMC-run schools. “It is NMC’s responsibility to provide primary education. NMC should promote and improve quality of NMC schools. The decision will also result in closure of some schools which are running with only a few students. It is the right of each and every children to get education from NMC in his/her area itself. NMC should not move children to other schools,” he said.

NAGPUR: Indukala Chauhan , 55, died after sustaining serious head injuries when her son Sanjay’s bike had abruptly slipped into a pothole near Hazaripahad chowk on Sunday. Ignoring the high court direction, Gittikhadan police did not register an offence in the case but mentioned it only as an accidental death.

The Nagpur bench of Bombay high court, taking a suo moto cognisance of the potholes in the city, had issued strictures for cops in 2019 urging them to register offence against the erring contractor and officials concerned of the Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) in case of deaths due to bad roads. The court had taken cognisance of the potholes problems in the city highlighted by TOI.

It is learnt that Indukala, a widow, was heading to her relative’s place at Hazaripahad from her residence at Futala Road. She was riding pillion on her son bike. She had fallen off the bike after it nosedived into the pothole. The same pothole was repaired in the past too but got damaged again due to poor work.

Sources in the locality said that several accidents have happened at the spot in the last several months. “Due to the slope, the bikers tend to miss the pothole and get a surprising jerk after landing on it,” they said. Repeated poor asphalting had made the surface rough and ugly leading to a crater-like depression on the road.

Sanjay said he had failed to spot the same pothole in the past too due to the slope but had got saved. “There is a huge pothole on the left side of the road which is dangerous. It cannot be spotted from far due to slope. It was unfortunate that my mother lost her grip after the sudden jerk and fell on her head,” he said. “She was lying on her face with blood oozing from her nose and mouth,” said Sanjay who works with a private company. “We were heading to give gold ornaments to our relative ahead of my cousin’s marriage,” he said.

Sanjay said two women extended ardent help to them by offering to rush his mother to Dande hospital from where they brought her to GMCH. “She was declared brought dead at GMCH,’ he said.

Gittikhadan police’s senior PI Sunil Gangurde was clueless about the incident despite the fact that the case was registered as an accidental death at his police station.

Nashik: Members of Nashik district EPF Pensioners Association on Tuesday staged a demonstration in front of the Nashik divisional office of the EPFO to push their demand for increase in their monthly pension from the current Rs 1,000 to Rs 9,000.

Raju Desle, president, Nashik District EPF Pensioners Association, said that it has become very difficult for the pensioners to survive with the meagre amount of pension in times of inflation and also slammed the Centre for continuously ignoring the retirees.

“We have been demanding for almost a decade that the central government increase the pension under EPF 95, but in vain. It is very difficult to manage with the paltry amount of pension we get,” said

“Inflation has been steadily rising, but the pension amount has remained the same. We want the Centre to look into the issue on an urgent basis and increase the pension to Rs 9,000 per month,” he said.

“In 2014, the BJP had promised pension of Rs 3,000 per month to pensioners under EPF 95 within 100 days of coming to power. The same party has come to power for a second time, but it has still failed to fulfil its promise. We want the BJP to take a positive decision in the interest of pensioners,” said Desle.

There are around 186 establishments under the EPF 95. Presently, there are close to 70 lakh pensioners across the country under the EPF 95, including 15 lakh in Maharashtra.

In Nashik district alone, there are around 45,000 pensioners (under EPF 95) who get a Rs 1,000 per month.

They have been demanding monthly a pension of at least Rs 9,000, including dearness allowance and better medical facilities through ESIS hospitals of the government.

Osmania University

SECUNDERABAD: The Osmania University ( OU ) put the onus for errors in the recently-declared undergraduate exam results on the students.

Some students were declared absent in the mark memo despite appearing for the exams. Following this, the university administration conducted an internal preliminary scrutiny to ascertain the root causes for the errors, which were fixed by the authorities.

The investigation found that at the time of examination, few students had entered wrong subjects which was noted neither by the chief superintendents nor the students or the invigilators. “When the results were processed, there was a mismatch between the subjects offered and the subjects mentioned by the students. Hence, some students received memos as absent in the internet results,” read a press release issued by the university on Tuesday.

For instance, some students entered environmental science as a subject instead of environmental studies. Since the online evaluation and processing was programmed for one label, the candidate’s online result reflected that he/she was absent if they mentioned any other label.

The university has decided to issue a re-evaluation notification on Wednesday so that aggrieved students can file online applications.

Madurai: Road deaths have come down close to 39% in three years in Tamil Nadu, said transport commissioner T S Jawahar at a road safety meeting in Madurai district collectorate for Madurai and Virudhunagar districts on Tuesday. The number of deaths due to road accidents has reduced from 17, 200 in 2016 to 10,500 in 2019. The year 2018 witnessed 12, 200 road deaths, said the transport commissioner cum principal secretary.

Talking to the newsmen, Jawahar said that they have set an ambitious target of zero road deaths by the year 2030 and have started working towards it involving various departments. Tamil Nadu has road infrastructure measuring a length of 2 lakh km with 2.90 crore vehicles, including 2.45 crore two-wheelers. In Madurai and Virudhunagar alone the road length is around 7,000 km with 18.38 lakh vehicles including 16 lakh two-wheelers. The two districts, which witnessed 1,102 road deaths in 2018, came down to 661 in 2019. He said that the number of road fatalities has come down in Madurai and Virudhunagar considerably. Identification of around 40 black spots in Madurai and 24 in Virudhunagar district and increase in road safety helped them bring down the number of road deaths.“Two-wheelers account for most of the road deaths in the state and deaths occur mainly because of not wearing helmet,” he said.

“Human error is behind most of the accidents than any other reason. Drunk and driving and mobile phone usage while driving are the major reasons. There is a provision in motor vehicle act to arrest those driving under the influence of alcohol and police will soon implement it. More than 3 lakh licenses have been cancelled between 2016 and 2019 for series of violations,” he said. Road engineering has been improved to make the roads safer. Already orders have been issued to include road safety features while laying new roads. When asked whether the shortage of staff in transport department is crippling essential services, he denied it. Around 50,000 learning licenses, 32,000 new license, 24,000 license renewals and 5,107 endorsements have been done in 2019. The recent recruitment of motor vehicle inspectors is under court inquiry. New recruits will join once clearance comes out, he said.

IG traffic and road safety Promodh Kumar, Madurai and Virudhunagar district collectors T G Vinay and R Kannan, Madurai city police commissioner, S Davidson Devasirvatham, Madurai range DIG Annie Vijaya, Madurai district superintendent of police N Manivannan and Madurai city traffic deputy commissioner K Sugumaran took part in the meeting.

389,['12/02/2020'],Grapes exporters stress on quality of fruit,"This story is from February 12, 2020

Nashik: Exporters of grapes from Nashik have stressed on the need for fruit growers to lay greater emphasis on its quality.

They have also asked the growers to cultivate new export varieties of grapes to capture international market.

The Maharashtra Farmers-Producers Organisation, in association with a private logistics company, organised a workshop on Tuesday.

As part of the workshop, experts guided farmers on what they should do to increase the export of grapes.

China is the largest exporter of grapes in the world while India stands on the seventh position. There is good potential for the country to increase the export of grapes if it takes proper measures, said Mahendra Ingle, an expert in grapes export.

“There is a need to cultivate international varieties of table grapes which have a huge demand in the European and non-European countries. Moreover, the size of the fruit needs to be between 16 and 18 mm,” he said.

Nashik is a major grapes growing pocket in the country; however, the export of table grapes is only 8% of the total production.

Thomson seedless and Falme seedless are the common varieties of table grapes being cultivated in India.

In the recent times, farmers cultivating grapes have introduced new varieties of table grapes like Red Globe, Arra-32, Crimson and Fantasy seedless and Sudhakar.

“It takes about 35-45 days for shipping grapes to various European countries. Hence, the shelf life of the grapes is more important so that consumers will get good quality of grapes after the consignment reaches after shipping period,” Ingle said.

Moreover, exporters should also know the export markets and their competitors. Hence, exporters need to lay more focus on marketing, Ingle added.

Meanwhile, Nashik district has exported 1,458 containers with 19,367 tonnes of grapes to European countries by February 10 in the current season.

During the corresponding period last year, the district had exported 1,853 containers with 24,763 tonnes of grapes.

Nearly 250 outlets in and around Kolkata are facing a supply crisis

KOLKATA: Shortage in supply of raw milk and increasing prices of skimmed milk powder has dried up many of the Mother Dairy outlets in and around Kolkata. The state-run milk production unit, which supplies milk to the city at cheapest rates, is struggling to restore normalcy at nearly 250 outlets.

The situation had started to look grim a few months back after supplies from some of the milk cooperatives reduced substantially. It turned worse in the past few days with supplies to areas like Salt Lake, Lake Town, Kalindi, Dum Dum, Belgharia, portions of south Kolkata, Howrah and Dankuni being hit. Vending shops in many of these areas remained dry. Mother Dairy tried to salvage the situation by sending its own vehicles and restore supply, but it failed to work out.

“We are aware of the situation and hope to restore normalcy in the next few days. There is a shortage of raw material and we are trying to bridge the gap,” said Swapan Debnath, minister of the animal husbandry development department.

The state-run unit supplies more than 2.1 lakh litres milk at rates of at least Rs 6 (per litre) cheaper than its competitors. Mother Dairy procures around 75,000 litres from milk producers like Bhagirathi Cooperative, Midnapore Cooperative, Kishan Cooperative, Damodar Cooperative and Kangsabati Cooperative. “The supplies to Mother Dairy has come down after other companies like Amul started offering a better price to farmers,” said Pijush Kanti Ghosh, joint general secretary of Bhagirathi Dugdha Utpadak Sangha (Murshidabad). Faced with the crisis, the animal husbandry department has now sought permission from the finance ministry to increase milk procurement price by Rs 4 per litre.

HYDERABAD: It’s a monumental task to keep unruly honking drivers in check. Despite strict norms, most motorists have their thumb placed firmly on the horn button, at times even at no-horn zones.So, TOI decided to record decibel levels at various places to assess how the honk-happy city fared. TOI used two different sound meter apps that detect sound in decibels (dB) and displays the last 30 seconds of data on an easy-to-read graph. The apps showed that every time a motorist on a two-wheeler or small car honked, noise levels went up to 75dB. In case of heavy vehicles, such as a bus or lorry, decibel levels even crossed 100 against the safety limit of 60 (45dB at night). Areas checked by TOI were Panjagutta, Ameerpet, Moazzam Jahi Market, Kukatpally, KBR Park junction and Hitec City.Data procured from Telangana State Pollution Control Board also showed that real-time noise levels recorded in seven areas in January were higher than permissible limits.However, few drivers said that this was the only way to navigate on busy city roads. Kranthi Kumar, who drives a cab, said, “People don’t give way. I can’t shout at them, so I honk and tell them to give way.”Mohammad Faazil, a resident of SR Nagar, said, “Mindless honking has become a habit for drivers. Buses at Ameerpet, SR Nagar and Kukatpally are the worst of the lot. They start honking from 5am.”Traffic cops attributed the honking to unscientific junctions and bad roads. “Lack of lane discipline is also a reason. We book cases for noise pollution regularly but that will not yield results unless people start following sound norms. We are working with GHMC to improve junction and road geometry,” said SM Vijay Kumar, DCP, Cyberabad traffic, adding, “We are booking cases against heavy vehicles that use air horns and pressure horns, which are prohibited as per Central Motor Vehicle Act. Every vehicle must use only electric horn as per rules.”",hyderabad,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74092534,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-201732,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/honking-shatters-sound-norms-touches-100db-in-certain-areas/articleshow/74089395.cms

Nashik: The Nashik Municipal Corporation ( NMC ) has collected Rs 21 crore from property tax defaulters through its amnesty scheme that was implemented between December 15, 2019, and February 10, 2020.

As per the scheme, defaulters who paid their dues in one go were given a waiver in penalty, warrant and notice fees. The civic body waived the penalty amounting of Rs 5.87 crore for defaulters who paid their dues.

“We had planned on collecting Rs 50 crore through the amnesty scheme, but we could manage only Rs 21 crore in revenue from tax defaulters under the scheme. We had waived the tax penalty to the defaulters who paid all their dues,” said NMC officials.

This was the second time the amnesty scheme was introduced.

In September last year, the civic body had introduced the amnesty scheme. Penalty on property taxes of defaulters who cleared their dues was waived then. NMC had collected dues amounting to Rs 30 crore through amnesty scheme in just one month that time. Considering the good response, the NMC administration re-introduced the scheme between December 15 and February 10 but did not receive a good response like before.

“This was the last opportunity for the defaulters to take benefits of the scheme. Now, we will take action against the defaulters,” said the NMC official.

NMC has already announced that it will auction the properties of 89 tax defaulters on February 26.

Last financial year (2018-19), the NMC had collected property tax amounting to Rs 112 crore. It was for the first time that the NMC’s property tax collection target had touched Rs 100 crore. The civic body has set a property tax collection target of Rs 218 crore for the current financial year (2019-20). By February 10, it had collected Rs 133.65 crore.

The couple committed suicide by hanging themselves from ceiling fan of the living room between 4pm and 6pm,” said Vanasthalipuram inspector, A Venkataiah.

A relative of the couple who was visiting the house found their bodies. “The child is currently staying at Venkat’s sister’s house nearby. We found a suicide note, which said: ‘No one is responsible for our suicide’. It was shocking for their relatives and families too,” added the officer.

A case of suspicious death case was registered.

396,['12/02/2020'],Revenue dept told to gear up for Purandar land acquisition,"This story is from February 12, 2020

Pune: Deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar has directed the district administration to gear up for the land acquisition process for the proposed international airport in Purandar.

Even as doubts persist over the site for the project, Pawar, at a recent meeting, told officials to prepare for initiating talks with landowners.

Pune collector Naval Kishore Ram told TOI that they would initiate the process once a formal government resolution (GR) is issued. “After a formal notification, we should be able to carry out the talks with the land owners in question,” he said.

Earlier, acting on the previous government’s orders, the district administration had appointed seven deputy collectors to oversee the land acquisition process. However, the process was stalled — first by stiff resistance from the villagers, who refused to part with their land, and then by the assembly elections held last year.

“As of now status quo prevails,” Ram said.

The district administration, meanwhile, has completed checking the mutation extracts of the land owners to establish clear land titles for seven villages — Pargaon, Khanawadi, Munjwadi, Ekhatpur, Kumbharvalan, Vanpuri and Udachiwadi — another official added.

Pawar is learnt to have expressed his desire to the officials that the Purandar airport project, as well as extension work of the Lohegaon facility, be put on the fast track.

Officials said they would proceed with the land acquisition only after thorough discussions with the land owners. A total of 2,832 hectares will need to be acquired from the seven villages. A proposal in this regard was sent to the state government in 2017 and approved in 2018.

(Left-right) Satyendar Jain, Vijender Gupta and Kailash Gahlot

NEW DELHI: The battle for Delhi was expected to be a closely fought contest. But at the end, except for Manish Sisodia who faced a tough fight in Patparganj , AAP candidates largely had walkovers on most seats.

Complete coverage on Delhi elections

Arvind Kejriwal, his cabinet colleagues Satyendar Jain , Gopal Rai, Kailash Gahlot and Imran Hussain romped home comfortably along with Ram Niwas Goel, Rakhi Bidlan, AAP chief spokesperson Saurabh Bharadwaj and party’s prominent faces Atishi, Raghav Chadha and Dilip Pandey.

Given a marginal drop in AAP’s vote share and a 6% increase in BJP’s, the victory margin on some seats dropped by a few thousand, but the difference was not much to create any scare for the candidates.

In New Delhi, Kejriwal defeated his closest rival, BJP’s Sunil Yadav, by a comfortable margin of 21,697 votes. In 2015, Kejriwal had won this seat with a margin of 31,583 votes. Yadav, who grew up in the slums of the constituency, had made the contest a fight between a local and an outsider, but proved no match to the charisma of Kejriwal. Congress’s Romesh Sabharwal, son of a government employee who also called himself a local boy, was a distant third with just 3,206 votes.

With Kejriwal to take oath soon, this is the sixth consecutive time New Delhi will give the city its chief minister.

AAP Delhi convener and labour minister Gopal Rai defeated BJP’s Naresh Gaur by 33,062 votes. In 2015, Rai had defeated Gaur by a margin of 35,271 votes.

In Shakur Basti, Satyendar Jain had a relatively close contest with BJP’s S C Vats, who was elected MLA twice in 1998 and 2003 from the same seat on a Congress ticket. Though Jain trailed in the first round of counting, he slowly emerged as the leader and eventually defeated Vats by 7,592 votes.

Similarly, Kailash Gahlot had an interesting battle with BJP’s Ajit Kharkhari , who had won this seat in 2013 but lost in 2015. Both Gahlot and Kharkhari won a few rounds of counting each before the former built up on the lead and won by 6,231 votes.

Kalkaji also saw an interesting battle between AAP’s Atishi and BJP’s Dharambir Singh. Singh maintained a thin lead in the first four rounds while the next six were almost even. Atishi started consolidating her lead from round 11 and finally won by 11,393 votes.

BJP’s Vijender Gupta, who won his second consecutive election from Rohini, was also initially trailing but finally defeated Rajesh Nama Bansiwala of AAP by 12,648 votes.

In Badarpur, BJP’s Ramvir Singh Bidhuri emerged victorious by 3,719 votes, defeating his closest rival Ram Singh Netaji of AAP. Both Bidhuri and Netaji have been contesting against each other in Badarpur since 1993 when Delhi assembly was reconstituted. While Bidhuri won in 1993 on a Janata Dal ticket, Netaji won in 1998 as an Independent. In 2003, Bidhuri won as an NCP candidate, while Netaji won the 2008 election as a BSP candidate. In 2013, Bidhuri won again, this time as a BJP candidate while in 2015, they both lost to AAP’s N D Sharma. This time, Netaji contested on an AAP ticket and Sharma as a BSP candidate. While Netaji maintained a lead till the 23rd round of counting, Bidhuri got more votes in the remaining four rounds to pip the AAP candidate.

The biggest victory in terms of number of votes was registered by AAP’s Sanjeev Jha in Burari where he defeated his closest rival Shailendra Kumar of JD(U) by a huge margin 88,158 votes.

Both BJP and Congress let their allies contest in Burari, which has a large number of unauthorised colonies and a sizeable population of Poorvanchalis. Jha polled almost 63% of votes, Kumar got 23%, followed by 9% going to Shiv Sena’s kitty. RJD candidate Pramod Tyagi, who was supported by Congress, could barely get 1% votes.

Similarly, the blood alcohol content (BAC) levels of the injured will also be checked.In a majority of the cases, driver of the bigger vehicle is booked as an accused. If an accident involves a pedestrian and a two-wheeler rider or a car driver, most of times, the motorist or car driver is booked as an accused.“If the victim is a biker and the other vehicle involved is a car or a heavy vehicle, the latter gets named as an accused in the FIR. While analysing the road accident data, we have noticed that in some of the cases, pedestrians or the smaller vehicle rider or driver is also at fault,” said Cyberabad DCP SM Vijay Kumar.In several accidents in the city, drunk driving is a factor. “So, all the SHOs have been strictly instructed to check for BAC of the victims in fatal and non-fatal accidents,” he explained.In a road accident that occured on February 9 night at Gachibowli where two bike riders died, police officials found out that the rider did not have a driving licence.Investigators also found out that the duo was returning after attending a party held to celebrate the purchase of the new bike.In another example, a car driver was booked by Kukatpally police after a biker suffered injuries in an accident a few months ago. During investigation it was revealed that the biker was found to be riding under the influence of liquor without wearing a helmet. it was found that the biker drove in a rash manner, causing the accident.“We are investigating all accident cases thoroughly.

Subhash Chopra

NEW DELHI: Taking moral responsibility of the party’s humiliating defeat in the assembly polls, Delhi Congress president Subhash Chopra on Tuesday offered to resign from the post.

Complete coverage on Delhi elections

Sources said Chopra wrote to Congress chief Sonia Gandhi, saying he had tried to do his best to resurrect the party in whatever little time he was given. “I am a disciplined solider of the party. Taking moral responsibility, I offer to quit,” Chopra reportedly wrote to the Congress chief.

Chopra was appointed the president of Delhi Pradesh Congress Committee (DPCC) in October 2019.

Congress lost polls in 66 constituencies, while its candidates lost deposits in 63. The vote share of the party, which formed the state government till six years ago, dropped from 9.7% in 2015 to a little over 4% in this election. In 2013, Congress had won just eight seats but failed to open its account in 2015.

Its lacklustre campaign failed to catch the fancy of voters. Of the four assembly seats where Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra held public meetings, the party got less than 5% votes in three of them — Seelampur, Kondli and Chandni Chowk.

400,['12/02/2020'],No movement on project without my consent: MLA,"This story is from February 12, 2020

Pune: Purandar MLA Sanjay Jagtap on Tuesday said no progress can be made on the proposed international airport project in Purandar taluka without his consent.

“Officially, I have not received any information about development related to the project. I am not aware if any decision was taken by the state government. If there were any meetings, I should have been included too,” Jagtap, a Congress MLA, said.

Jagtap’s remarks come after Pune collector Naval Kishore Ram said they were instructed by deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar to initiate talks with the landowners, once a government resolution is issued in this regard.

Pawar had recently expressed his determination to go forward with the project on the grounds that flyers were being inconvenienced by restrictions at the Lohegaon airport in Pune.

Jagtap, who was elected to the state legislature after defeating Shiv Sena’s incumbent, Vijay Shivtare, by 31,000 votes, had maintained that while he was not opposed to the airport coming up in Purandar. He had started that the current site needed to be changed, as fertile land was earmarked for acquisition. “There are other places in the taluka, where the airport could be developed and no villages will be affected this way,” Jagtap said.

Shivtare, according to local residents, had become unpopular because of his support for the project. Nearly 3,000 acres of the land would be required from seven villages in the taluka — Pargaon, Khanawadi, Munjwadi, Ekhatpur, Kumbharvalan, Vanpuri and Udachiwadi

“If the state government selects a new site, things have to start from the scratch. This means approvals from different departments and ministries, and planning and preparation of another detailed project report (DPR). It took the state government two years to get all these approvals, and going through the whole process all over again will mean more delays,” an official involved in the project said, adding that as things stood, there could be unrest if the government went ahead with the land acquisition process. “The state government needs to be very cautious,” the official said.

The landowners, meanwhile, said their stand remains unchanged. “If the government goes for forceful land acquisition, we will approach the court. No district administration official came to us so far. If they come, they are in for trouble,” one landowner said.

Pune: March onwards, the cash-strapped Dehu Road Cantonment Board (DRCB) is likely to be in a bind over payment of salaries and pensions to their serving and retired employees.

According to the board’s records, there are 254 permanent employees and 301 retired staffers who may face the brunt of the financial crunch in coming months.

""We won’t be able to pay salaries to our employees next month if the prevailing situation continues and we do not get the pending service charges,” the board’s chief executive officer, R Haritwal, said.

The board has not received a substantial chunk of service charges pending with the military engineering services (MES) for many years, officials said.

With limited sources of income, the board’s annual revenue generation is around Rs20 crore, officials said. In contrast, their monthly expenditure is around Rs3.5 crore which includes salaries, pension and bills of basic civic facilities.

The board’s financial position has taken a nosedive with the abolition of local body tax and virtually no funds from the defence ministry, board authorities said.

“We are in the process of increasing hoarding charges. We are also collecting pending property taxes and water bills, collectively amounting to Rs4.5 crore,” Haritwal added.

Vice president Raghuvir Shelar of the board, said, “The Director General Defence Estates (DGDE) did not release funds to the board despite knowing our financial position. We are going to hold a meeting soon with the defence minister and DGDE authorities, in this regard.”

“If we get service charges from various defence establishments which are operating or functioning in our limit, the board will not face any financial difficulties,” he said.

“At present, the board does not have adequate funds to create additional revenue generation sources,” he added.

“Providing health care facilities has become a major challenge for us. We do not know how to continue the service in coming months,” an official from the health section told TOI.

A senior official from the board told TOI, “We have taken up several initiatives to save expenditure.”

Pune: Altogether 325 'taradoots' appointed by the Chhatrapati Shahu Maharaj Research Training and Human Development Institute (Sarthi), Pune, are yet to receive their salaries for two months.

'Taradoots' were appointed by the institution to spread awareness about the schemes and scholarships available for Maratha, Maratha-Kunbi, Kunbi-Maratha and Kunbi communities and promised an honorarium of Rs18,000 per month.

In August 2019, advertisements were issued to fill 1,440 posts of ‘taradoots’. Sarthi selected 782 candidates for training following an examination.

The training was conducted in three batches -- September 9 to October 5; November 4 to November 26; and December 3 to December 24.

While 325 candidates, who were a part of the training held for the first two batches, received their orders to join last year, the last batch of 155 candidates did not receive joining letter.

“We worked throughout December and January. I was asked to work at Karjat taluka in Ahmednagar district along with other two ‘taradoots’. We spent money from our own pocket because we thought we would be paid. Then we stopped working. We are unemployed and looking for work again,” said Mahesh Walke, a ‘taradoot’.

An official, on condition of anonymity, said, “The process from our side has been completed, but the government has to do its part. Sarthi has funds to give honorarium for the first month --December -- but we can’t do so without government permission.”

“For January, the government would have to provide funds. An inquiry is being conducted over alleged irregularities in Sarthi due to which we cannot pay salary without government’s approval,” he added.

NEW DELHI: Aam Aadmi Party’s near repeat of its 2015 performance came on the back of its retaining close to the same vote share as it did five years ago, with its share dropping by less than a percentage point from 54.3% to 53.6%. Despite BJP gaining close to six percentage points from 32.8% in 2015 to 38.5% this time, the gap of over 15 percentage points was too wide to reduce the ruling party’s vote share significantly.At a disaggregated level, AAP made a clean sweep of five of Delhi’s nine districts, winning all 38 seats in the central, north, southwest and west districts as well as New Delhi. By far the most impressive of these was central district where the party mopped up 62% of the votes cast leaving BJP with just 32.2%. In the remaining four, AAP’s vote share varied in a narrow band from 53% to 56.4% and BJP’s between 33% in north Delhi and 41.8% in southwest Delhi.In contrast to its dominance in these five districts, AAP toughest fight was in east Delhi where its vote share of 47.4% was less than two percentage points higher than BJP’s 45.6%. Little wonder then that it lost three of eight seats here to BJP.BJP’s vote share in northeast Delhi at 39.5% wasn’t much higher than its statewide share, and this was considerably below AAP’s 51.5%. Yet, the concentration of BJP votes in specific seats meant that it managed to pick up three of the eight seats in this district too. In northwest Delhi, on the other hand, BJP had a vote share of 41% but managed to pick up a solitary seat.The Congress vote share did not cross 7% in any district, its best show being in New Delhi where it mopped up 6.9% of the votes cast. At the other end of the spectrum, it could manage a measly 2.5% in south Delhi, low even when compared to its statewide share of 4.3%.The elections were thus remarkably bipolar with the combined AAP-BJP vote share being 92.1% at the overall level and falling below 90% only in north Delhi. Even this was because BJP did not contest Burari in this district, leaving it for its ally, the JD(U).",delhi,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74093324,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-137767,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/aap-almost-retains-15-vote-sweeps-5-districts/articleshow/74090326.cms

Pune: The Wanowrie police on Monday booked a fraudster after he discreetly replaced a security guard’s debit card with an inoperative one on the pretext of assisting him in withdrawing Rs6,000 at an ATM on Ramtekdi junction.

The incident occurred between 10.30am and 11am on Saturday.

The suspect later withdrew cash, purchased saris and gold ornaments, collectively worth Rs97,700 from the security guard’s debit card.

The security guard Ghanshyam Gaikwad (59), who works at school in Pune cantonment, visited the ATM near his residence on Saturday. He put the debit card in the machine and typed the pin number to withdraw cash but the amount was not dispensed.

Gaikwad told TOI, “When I stepped out of the ATM kiosk, the fraudster greeted me with a smile. He told me to give him my card and that he would help me withdraw the cash. I believed him and did as he told me to. But, the machine did not dispense cash. He then replaced my card with an inoperative one. As I was in a hurry to report for work, I did not check it.”

He said the fraudster later used his card to withdraw Rs40,000 in four instalments of Rs10,000 from various places. “He also used the card to purchase a sari and gold ornaments. I got to know of the transactions after my daughter saw text messages on my cellphone, which was at home.”

By the time Gaikwad got the debit card blocked, he was left with Rs7,700 in his account. “When I visited the bank on Monday and obtained the statement of the transactions I saw that I was left with no money at all. I realized that I had been tricked. I suspect the fraudster stole my pin number while he was standing outside the glass cabin. He replaced my card with an inoperative one in the name of a West Bengal resident,” he said.

Assistant inspector Vishwajeet Jagtap from the Wanowrie police said, “Gaikwad has given the description of the fraudster. He had a beard and wore a tshirt and trousers. He looked like he was around 30 to 32 years old. We have written to the bank to share the CCTV camera footage.”

The Wanowrie police have booked the suspect under Section 420 (cheating) of the Indian Penal Code.

407,['12/02/2020'],Gramsevaks could grant nod to building plans in villages,"This story is from February 12, 2020

CLEARED SKHER

Kolhapur: The state government is considering authorising the gram sevak or the secretary of the gram panchayat to grant building permissions in their villages, instead of the current method of centralised authority at the district level.

Rural development minister Hasan Mushrif on Monday said the village panchayats has recommended to the government that the authority of building permissions be handed over to them.

“The state government is going to take the decision to grant the authority of the building permissions to gram sevak, who is the village secretary. The applications will be approved once the technical scrutiny is done by the engineers of the panchayat samiti,” he said.

Mushrif added that training will be provided to the engineers and the gramsevaks at Yashwantrao Chavan Academy of Development Administration (Yashada) Pune.

“Currently, the authority to sanction building permissions is with the town planning department. However, the department does not have adequate staff. The villagers face delays in getting loans if the building permissions take time. The gramsevaks will be trained to get the knowledge of the development plans,” he said.

Mushrif also said that there is a need to develop the villages per the local necessity. For instance, he said that local authorities should ensure that adequate open spaces are left for gardens and playgrounds.

Recently, the villagers from 42 villages in the district which are under Kolhapur Urban Area Development Authority had claimed that over 700 building proposals were pending with the town planning department.

Town planning experts have reacted sharply to the government’s plans. They warned that if the building permissions are granted without proper study, it will create haphazard development in the rural parts.

Shashikant Phadtare, expert member of the regional plan committee, said, “We have always maintained that the planning and building proposals should be scrutinised by independent experts. The engineers with panchayat samiti and the gramsevaks do not have knowledge of town planning and the building rules. Improper scrutiny of the building proposals will certainly result into civic problems in the future.”

408,['12/02/2020'],Poor coordination among agencies flagged by babus,"This story is from February 12, 2020

Chennai: At the launch of the mega streets project on Tuesday, top IAS officials highlighted the various issues faced by the government agencies in-charge of running Chennai, pointing out that there was poor co-ordination among several of them.

Vikram Kapur, chairman and managing director of state-run power utility Tangedco, said that despite such grand plans, the city corporation lacked an urban planner and planning was being done by Chennai Metropolitan Development Authority (CMDA) and private agencies like ITDP. As for work on city roads, Kapur, a former Greater Chennai Corporation commissioner himself, said many were under control of the state highways department and that they had to be ‘aligned’ with the civic body’s vision and the two agencies had to work together.

“Coordination among Metrowater, Tangedco, GCC [Greater Chennai Corporation], BSNL, etc., is always a challenge,” he said. It is impossible to expect all utilities to come together just to lay a proper street in this scenario, he said, adding that Chennai should have a city-based government like in several foreign countries, but since that was not possible, officials needed to find their own way.

Kapur suggested that like building regulations, design of streets should be given statutory teeth by getting it into development regulations. “Non-motorised transport policy should be taken forward and legislated to safeguard interest of pedestrians,” he said.

Transport secretary D P Yadav also alluded to how sister agencies like Metrowater and the city corporation lacked co-ordination due to ‘last mile connectivity’. The official spoke of how Chennai Unified Metropolitan Transport Authority (Cumta) has not taken off and suggested that ideas like smart city should not change the character of a city. “Areas like Sowcarpet and T Nagar have their own character. We should have area-based development plans for them,” he said.

The tide began turning Manish Sisodia’s way from the 10th round (Photo: PTI)

NEW DELHI: In the sea of certainty that Delhi turned into for the Aam Aadmi Party as results began pouring in on Tuesday, the one constituency that jangled the party’s nerves was east Delhi’s Patparganj. For several hours, it seemed that deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia could lose.

Complete coverage on Delhi elections

The see-saw battle started from Round 1 itself when Sisodia emerged with a slender lead of 112 votes over Bharatiya Janata Party’s Ravinder Singh Negi. The lead fell to 74 votes at the end of Round 2 of counting. Negi gained the lead after that. Around noon, when AAP was getting into celebration mode as the overwhelming mandate became clear, Sisodia was still struggling. At the end of the sixth round, he trailed Negi by over 2,000 votes. While AAP workers were twitchy, BJP supporters, sensing an unexpected victory, grew vocal.

Sisodia, clad in a maroon sweater, sat quietly in a corner seat visibly tense and reluctant to talk to reporters, tracking each update from polling agents. Till the ninth round, what he heard wasn’t encouraging. Just six rounds remained, and Negi was still in the lead.

For a man who won the seat in 2015 won by a margin of 28,791 votes, this was unfamiliar territory. But the tide began turning Sisodia’s way from the 10th round as counting from the Mandawali booths began. He nosed ahead in the 11th with a lead 656 votes and increased it to 1,500 in the 12th round. Sisodia finally won by 3,207 votes.

The big smile that eventually appeared on his face showed how relieved he was. “I am happy to become the MLA from Patparganj assembly constituency again. BJP tried politics of hate but the people of Delhi chose a government that works for the people,” Sisodia said in a hurried victory speech before rushing to join other winning candidates at the party headquarters.

Sisodia, seen as the man behind Aam Aadmi Party’s reforms in the education sector, had just two weeks prior to polling extended support to the women protesting at Shaheen Bagh against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act. There was conjecture at the booth all day that this might have played a role in how people voted at Patparganj, the most high-profile seat for AAP after New Delhi, which is the home turf of chief minister Arvind Kejriwal.

Sisodia, Delhi’s education minister, first won the Patparganj seat in 2013 defeating BJP’s Nakul Bhardwaj — his vote share increased from 41.5% to 53.5% in 2015.

Both BJP and Congress chose relatively new faces against Sisodia for the latest contest. Negi and Laxman Rawat of Congress were debutants, both migrants from the Garhwal hills in Uttarakhand.

410,['12/02/2020'],50 'Ganga Praharis’ from 5 states undergo training for conservation of river,"This story is from February 12, 2020

Dehradun: As many as 50 ‘Ganga Praharis’ (volunteers drafted from local communities under the Namami Gange scheme for acting as the guardians of the river) from states like Uttarakhand, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Jharkhand and West Bengal have completed a week’s training at Dehradun-based Wildlife Institute of India (WII) to lead conservation activities of river Ganga and join hands with the state forest departments in their respective states in the population census of various aquatic species.

The 'praharis' would help the jal shakti and environment ministries in the rescue and rehabilitation of aquatic species, conducting minor forensic tests, livelihood development in and around the villages on Ganga banks, and micro-planning of biodiversity at village level. At present, they are being roped in to study the river and conserve it. The training, under the Wildlife Institute of India-National Mission for Clean Ganga’s Biodiversity Conservation Initiative Phase-II, started at the WII campus in Dehradun on February 3 and culminated at Parmarth Niketan ashram in Rishikesh on Monday.

Speaking about the initiative, WII director Dhananjai Mohan said, “These participants have been actively involved with the project as 'Ganga Praharis' for the last three years. Hence, they have been selected to spearhead the conservation efforts in mainstream Ganga and its selected tributaries. They are well-versed with the details of the river’s biodiversity and has shown keen interest in pursuing a career in the same field.” These 'praharis' would also be involved in conducting cleanliness and plantation drives along with mobilisation of school children in their respective states.

Senior scientist and project co-ordinator of Biodiversity Conservation Initiative Phase-II SA Hussain said, “During the training, the participants were also imparted relevant IT skills and the know-how of various applications like Bhuvan Ganga and Aqualife Data. These applications will enable the Ganga Praharis to monitor and report issues pertaining to the river in their respective areas.” He added that this would ultimately help the government in devising appropriate policies for people contributing to conservation activities at the grassroots level.

Arvind Kejriwal celebrations his victory at the party headquarters in New Delhi.

Opposition parties on Tuesday trained their guns on BJP while hailing AAP’s landslide win in Delhi assembly elections as a victory of chief minister Arvind Kejriwal’s “development agenda” over “divisive politics”.

Complete coverage on Delhi elections

Taking a dig at PM Narendra Modi without naming him, Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray said: “The people have shown that jan ki baat (voice of the masses) and not mann ki baat will run in this country.” Referring to the campaign by a large number of BJP’s bigwigs in Delhi polls, Thackeray said that despite bringing out its “entire might and raising international issues to deflect attention from local issues”, the party could not defeat Kejriwal. “They were swept away by the broom. They called Kejriwal a terrorist, yet people have voted for those who worked for them and stood strongly by democracy.”

Attacking the PM and the home minister, NCP chief Sharad Pawar said: “The Modi-Shah duo has completely failed in the capital. If regional parties come together and implement a common minimum programme, then defeating BJP in the 2024 general elections will be a foregone conclusion.”

Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee said BJP had become a “stateless party” as the defeat came on the heels of its loss in Maharashtra and Jharkhand. “Students and women have rebuffed the recent crackdown on protesters,” she said, referring to the measures taken to contain anti-CAA demonstrations. She added that BJP will be defeated in next year’s assembly elections in West Bengal as well.

DMK president M K Stalin, meanwhile, described AAP’s victory as a “clear vindication” that development trumps communal politics. Congratulating Kejriwal, CPM stalwart and Kerala CM Pinarayi Vijayan said: “Let this victory be a harbinger for pro-people and inclusive politics in our country.”

Former Karnataka CM and JD(S) functionary H D Kumaraswamy said people of Delhi have shown that “fascist ideology will never win their hearts”. Jharkhand CM Hemant Soren said AAP’s victory had re-established “the fact that people will not fall in trap of BJP’s divisive politics” while SP chief Akhilesh Yadav described AAP’s victory as an “auspicious” sign.

Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar, an ally of BJP in Delhi, reacted to the AAP victory, saying: “Janata malik hai”.

412,['12/02/2020'],CCTV cams have changed the way crime is probed: CoP Viswanathan,"This story is from February 12, 2020

The third eye (CCTV cameras) in various parts of the city has helped track down criminals, Greater Chennai Police Commissioner A K Viswanathan tells P Oppili in an interview. Excerpts:

What prompted you to install CCTV cameras across the city?

At the end of 2017, when I met chief minister Edappadi K Palanisami for a briefing he told me to control crime and that extensive coverage of CCTV cameras would help. At that time the city had very few cameras. He also suggested police approach residents, shop owners and companies to install cameras facing the road.

How many CCTV cameras are functioning now?

In the last three years, nearly 3 lakh cameras have been installed. They are monitored by people in most places. In some areas, police also monitoring them.

Can you list out a couple of incidents where camera footage helped nab offenders?

Last year, the control room received information that a man was found lying in front of a Tasmac outlet in north Chennai. When police visited the spot, the man was dead. Recording from a CCTV camera showed the complainant himself murdered the man. In the absence of a camera, it would have taken a long time to identify and arrest the offender.

In another case, a Tiruvanmiyur resident complained that his relative’s Royal Enfield bike was stolen from his apartment complex. The resident even attached the CCTV camera footage which showed two persons moving around the area in a suspicious manner.

How far have cameras helped police in bringing culprits to book?

The third eye (CCTV cameras) has changed the way investigations are conducted. Earlier, in case of a theft, house-breaking, a robbery or any other offence, police had to rely on vehicle checks. And, they would get someone involved in another offence. In many cases, police found it difficult to establish the offender’s identity. Now, with cameras across the city, establishing the identity of the offender is very easy, particularly if he is a history-sheeter.

What is the range of the cameras?

…A normal camera has a range of about 50 metres. There are some with a range of up to even 100 metres. Similarly, the pixel size also varies from camera to camera.

How did you manage to install 3 lakh cameras?

The men in uniform held meetings with residents’ associations and shops and explained the importance of having the ‘third eye’. People were convinced and volunteered to install the cameras.

Nainital: Uttarakhand Power Corporation Limited ( UPCL ) on Tuesday informed the high court that its employees, and those working for the Uttarakhand Jal Vidyut Nigam Limited (UJVNL) and Power Transmission Corporation of Uttarakhand Limited (PTCUL) will not be able to use more than 9,000 units of electricity at subsidised rates.

In a compliance report, the UPCL informed the court that a decision had been taken to make the new cap applicable on all employees of the three corporations responsible for generation, management and distribution of electricity in the state. The managing directors of UPCL, PTCUL and UJVNL took the decision in a meeting last month.

“UPCL said that in a meeting, the three corporations had decided that no employee will be able to use more than 9,000 units of subsidised electricity and the rates charged would range from Rs 150 to Rs 640,” said BP Nautiyal, senior advocate appearing for the petitioners. Till now, staffers of these corporations could use 15,000 units of subsidised electricity and their power bills were capped between Rs 65 to Rs 425.

The bench of Chief Justice Ramesh Ranganathan and Justice Ramesh Chandra Khulbe was hearing a petition that alleged that employees of UJVNL, PTCUL and UPCL used unlimited amount of electricity virtually free of cost.

Nautiyal added that the UPCL also informed the court that it had sustained losses of more than Rs 83 crore in the last two financial years to make up for supplying electricity at highly subsidised rates to employees. “The UPCL said that over the financial years of 2017-18 and 2018-19, the company had to pay Rs 83.79 crore for subsidies,” Nautiyal said.

Meanwhile, the court also ordered UPCL to take control of meters installed at UJVNL employees' places. “The court was informed that there are still over a 1,000 meters that are under the jurisdiction of UJVNL that need to be transferred to UPCL. The court had earlier made it clear that all meters installed at homes of employees of the three corporations was to be controlled by UPCL,” Nautiyal said.

HYDERABAD: Among the 140-odd people in the state who have been currently kept in isolation facilities at home or hospitals for over 28 days, many are under the false impression of having contracted the disease, even after testing negative for the virus, said officials on Tuesday. Officials said that few members have been constantly asking for retesting and are calling district level monitoring teams seeking guidance. At least two repeat tests were done at the ICMR lab recently to assuage the panic-stricken patients.“While so far severe psychological illness has not been reported in the suspected patients, there are some who had returned from China and tested negative for the virus but continue to believe that they are infected. They are very worried on what to do or what not to do. They are being counselled,” said Dr Shiva Balaji, head of state, Integrated Disease Surveillance Programme (IDSP).Meanwhile, being in quarantine means that a person cannot go out of a room or not meet and speak to anyone (mobile is allowed only at home and not in hospital isolation) for days together. This can easily take a toll on the mental state of the person in quarantine, say experts, adding that being a highly social people, remaining secluded for longer periods has proved difficult to deal with for most Indians.“Being in quarantine can cause severe psychological distress to the suspected patients if the aspect of their mental health is not addressed.

Heightened fear regarding their health and death can lead into panic attacks, which can develop into an anxiety disorder in patients. Sometimes not getting timely updates on their health and not having someone to discuss or instil confidence can cause psychological trauma,” said Dr Virinchi Sharma, consultant psychiatrist.The state government had assigned counsellors to address the issue of patients in quarantine slipping into depression and a few patients at the Gandhi hospital were counselled by psychiatrists at the hospital.",hyderabad,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74091355,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-109714,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/panic-spreads-faster-than-virus-in-t/articleshow/74089499.cms

Kolhapur: The Kolhapur Municipal Corporation (KMC) has set up an all-women squad for recovering water tax dues and assisting other staff to disconnect water supply connections of defaulters.

The drive to recover water tax and disconnect the connections began from Tuesday. The officials said that they had to deal with women members of the families several times during recovery visits to households. They also said that, at times, officials found it difficult to convince women to clear water tax dues which is why there was a dire need of an all-women squad.

Prashant Pandat, chief water tax superintendent, said, “We have deployed ten women employees to carry out the task. They effectively convince the woman members of the family to clear the dues. Also, they can confront with them in case the decision to disconnect the connection is taken. We have other five men-only squads for tax recovery and to snap water connections. We had issued notices to the defaulters with dues more than Rs 10,000. However, many of them did not clear the dues. We have initiated action of disconnecting their water supply.”

The action was taken in several areas across the city. Some of the defaulters cleared the dues on the spot and some agreed to pay in a couple of days. The action was taken in areas such as Takala, Juna Budhwar Peth, Bhramapuri, Shivaji Park and Vikramnagar. The water supply department is going to prepare a list of major defaulters and make it public in the next couple of weeks.

Kolhapur: The Kolhapur Municipal Corporation (KMC) has organised a special camp on February 26 to grant building permissions of pending proposals, issue various building certificates, including the no-objection certificate.

While the purpose of the camp is to help citizens avoid frequent visits to the town planning office, the camp has also another motive — to increase the revenue of the department.

The KMC has set a target of Rs 43 crore for the financial year 2019-20 from various town planning fees. However, the department could only generate just Rs 12 crore. The officials said that the decline in the real estate sector is one of the major causes of dip in the revenue. They also said that the pending development proposals, too, is the reason behind the drop in the revenue.

Narayan Bhosale, assistant town planner of KMC, said, “Around 40% of the revenue is generated through various permissions, NOCs, maps, layout applications, deposits of various premiums and renewal of architectural designs. We expect windfall revenue during the camp. Similar camps were held twice last year. However, this camp is the last one. The officials and the surveyors are asked to come up with the details of all pending applications. The proposals of individual developers, construction firms and architects will be cleared during the camp.”

The KMC charges various town planning fees such as development charges, layout charges, NOC fees, charges for land modifications, fees of approval of the architectural designs, charges of zone maps, building certificates, commencement and occupancy certificates. A large number of citizens have their proposals related to building certificates pending with the town planning department . They need the certificates for bank loan-related matters. Also, citizens often seek various maps which will ensure that the residential units are constructed on the reserved land plots. All such tasks will be processed during the camp.

The camp will be heldat the town planning office located in Rajarampuri first lane of Bagal Market from 10 am to 6.00 pm.

In the last week of January, the students had sat on hunger strikes at the Babasaheb Ambedkar Bhavan on South Ambazari Road demanding removal of the contractor.During inquiry it surfaced that the students had taken Rs85,000 from the contractor forfeiting non-veg meals for 21 days and admittedly went on a jaunt to hill stations. On February 9, TOI had reported about the allegations submitted by the contractor.On Tuesday, the contractor said he had no problem in the amount of food and fruits students take away as long as all of it is consumed by them. “But most of it is generally not consumed and thrown away or left to rot in the rooms. As per rules, the inmates can’t takeaway food and fruits to their rooms but have to consume them in the dining area,” he said.The contractor has also alleged that some students have been boozing in the rooms, especially on Wednesdays and Sundays when non-veg food is served.Speaking to TOI, the students refuted the allegations and again blamed that the contractor of trying to suppress their objections. “The liquor photographs are four years old. A senior inmate was suspended and it is on record of the department,” a law student said.Another student admitted that some of them do carry the food to their rooms but in a limited quantity and for those not present during the meal hours. “Many of us study in libraries outside. The timings are fixed for serving food. We try to hold back some thalis for our friends who come late. If we don’t they will have to go hungry,” the student said.They agreed that some food gets left over but it is not as high as being claimed.The contractor alleged the students throw away the boiled eggs from their room window on the open plot adjacent to the hostel. “Some people have been collecting the food items as they are consumable,” he said.Sources said the inquiry panel is likely to verify the claim by speaking to these people who had been carrying the left over food.",nagpur,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74094072,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-190978,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/contractor-accuses-sc/st-hostel-inmates-of-wasting-food-enough-for-50/articleshow/74089550.cms

Jaipur: Rajasthan High Court has asked the Jaipur Municipal Corporation to remove the encroachments near Moti Dungri temple within two weeks and file an affidavit. The court also constituted a committee to suggest practical solution to encroachments on the road from Moti Dungri to Sanganeeri Gate.

The division bench of chief justice Indrajit Mohanty and Ashok Gaur gave the direction on a suo motu petition.

Vimal Chaudhary, amicus curie in the case, said the court had expressed its disappointment over the inaction by the government on the single bench order on June 1, 2017 directing the JMC to identity the encroachers and come out with rehabilitation plan. But it has failed to comply with the order.

Though the JMC sought two months’ time in the court on Tuesday, the court refused to grant it saying “Now with the advancement in science, people can identify the rocket lost in moon from earth but the JMC could not identify the encroachers.”

The court also issued notice to two legislators, Rafiq Khan of the Congress and former minister and BJP Malviya Nagar MLA Kalicharan Saraf, for preventing the public servants from discharging their duties. These MLAs were accused of preventing the officials of JMC who went to remove encroachments. The court constituted a team comprising commissioners of JMC, JDA, city police and district collector to suggest a practical solution.

Visakhapatnam: Around 40,000 consumers in GVMC limits are likely to be impacted by hike in electricity charges.

The power tariff has gone up by 90 paise per unit.

AP Eastern Power Distribution Company Limited (APEPDCL) said based on previous consumption records up to December 2019, these upper middle class households consume more than 500 units per month.

“These consumers will have to pay Rs 9.95 per unit against the exiting Rs 9.05,” said G Srinivasa Reddy, chief general manager (finance), APEPDCL.

Reddy said the discom identified nearly 90,000 consumers in its jurisdiction covering five coastal districts from Srikakulam to West Godavari as consumers having above 500 units power consumption per month in July.

In December, nearly 42,000 consumers had consumed more than 500 units.

“Most number of consumers come in Vizag city only among the five districts. Overall, the discom may get an additional revenue of Rs 60 crore per annum with the government’s decision,” Srinivasa Reddy told TOI. The electricity consumption goes up in summer and southwest monsoon season like May, June and July and low during winter--November and December.

“Due to high humidity and high temperature levels, June and July register maximum power consumption in Vizag city. Nearly 35,000 consumers in the city consumed more than 500 units in July 2019 with heavy use of A/Cs and fans,” said a senior official.

Areas like Seethammadhara, MVP Colony, Siripuram, Visakhapatnam beach, Lawson’s Bay Colony, Gajuwaka, Madhurawada, Ram Nagar, Waltair Uplands, Siripuram and Dwarakangar are some the localities where power consumption is high due to high humidity and use by upper middle-class households.

Puducherry: The legislative assembly of the Union territory of Puducherry will convene on Wednesday for a special session amidst the ruling Congress party deciding to go ahead with its proposal to pass a resolution against the Centre’s Citizenship amendment act (CAA) and lieutenant governor Kiran Bedi advising the government to refrain from making such a move.

Chief minister V Narayanasamy on Tuesday refused to answer queries on Bedi's letter on CAA to him citing 'conventional practices'. However, he said the legislative assembly will answer the issues raised by Bedi when it convenes on Wednesday.

The BJP had registered its strong protest on the Congress party's proposal to pass a resolution on CAA. The three members nominated to the assembly on Monday called on Bedi and submitted a memorandum following which Bedi wrote to the chief minister pointing out that Puducherry legislative assembly does not have the powers to discuss or deliberate on citizenship matter as it falls squarely within the domain of the Parliament and Centre.

The opposition AIADMK party on Tuesday came down heavily on the ruling Congress party for using the legislative assembly as a podium to wage a political battle against the Centre and to oppose all its policies.

""We are yet to get the agenda of the special session of the legislative assembly on Wednesday. By denying the agenda, the elected members were denied their rights to prepare themselves on the issues to be discussed on the floor of the assembly. The ruling party did not convene the session to discuss and redress the issues faced by the public but to gain political mileage. The ruling party uses the assembly to condemn the Centre and not for the welfare of the people,"" said AIADMK legislature party leader A Anbalagan.

He urged the Congress government in Puducherry to take a cue from the AIADMK government in Tamil Nadu in safeguarding farmlands and protecting the interests of the farmers.

""Tamil Nadu chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswami declared the delta regions as ecologically sensitive agricultural zones. Puducherry government must follow suit and declare its enclave Karaikal, the fag end of Cauvery delta as ecologically sensitive agricultural zones to protect the land and farmers from oil and gas exploration projects,"" he said.

Anbalagan warned that the party will stage a series of agitations if the government fails to declare Karaikal as ecologically sensitive agricultural zones.

Congress MLA N Dhanavelu, who was sacked from the party for anti-party activities after he levelled corruption charges against Narayanasamy and his cabinet colleagues may cause a major embarrassment to the ruling party if he renews his tirade on the floor of the assembly.

In the 30-member assembly, the Congress has 14 seats (after Dhanavelu was removed from the party). Its ally DMK has three and a lone independent candidate from Mahe has extended support to Congress. On the opposition side, All India NR Congress has seven and AIADMK four. Three BJP men were nominated as members of the legislative assembly.

Arvind Kejriwal bagged 61.1% of the total votes, assuming a lead of over 21,000 votes over his challenger, BJP... Read More

NEW DELHI: Initially projected as an “epic battle” between the incumbent chief minister and a “local slum boy”, the contest for New Delhi assembly constituency fizzled out as Arvind Kejriwal managed to sail through with ease.

Kejriwal bagged 61.1% of the total votes, assuming a lead of over 21,000 votes over his challenger, BJP’s Sunil Kumar Yadav. The MLA of this “star constituency” has been the chief minister of Delhi since 2008, with the trend expected to continue for another term.

Yadav, also the Yuva Morcha head of Delhi BJP, had said before the results that if he lost, he would not contest elections anymore and would, instead, “devote his life working for the sangathan.” In all, 25,061 votes were cast in Yadav’s favour, amounting to 32.7% of the overall votes.

Among the multiple factors that worked in Kejriwal’s favour was his overwhelming popularity as the face of AAP, and his family’s support in the door-to-door outreach campaign. While Kejriwal remained busy carrying out roadshows across the city, his family members — wife Sunita, daughter Harshita and son Pulkit — took on the mantle of campaigning.

Kejriwal’s daughter took a sabbatical to help her father in the campaign trail. While delivering his victory speech at the party headquarters, Kejriwal thanked his family for “working especially hard.” Sunita, a former IRS officer, said the campaigning saw several “ups and downs”, but the party members had complete faith in their work.

This will be third time that New Delhi assembly segment will be represented by Kejriwal, who had defeated sitting chief minister Sheila Dikshit in 2013. Before the delimitation exercise in 2008, this seat was known as Gole Market, which Dikshit had won in 1998 and 2003.

The geographically tiny constituency is no less diverse than the country. It includes the Lutyens’ area, which includes President’s Estate, bungalows of Union ministers, affluent colonies and markets like Connaught Place and Khan Market.

440,['12/02/2020'],Govt launches auto-mutation to simplify registration process,"This story is from February 12, 2020

Vijayawada: In a major change in the revenue department, the state government has introduced auto-mutation of all the services being extended to the people.

Chief minister YS Jaganmohan Reddy released a poster of the auto-mutation services at the Secretariat on Tuesday and launched the scheme.

With an amendment to the Andhra Pradesh Record of Rights in Land and Pattadar Pass Books Act, 1971, the officials of the registration department were recognised as provisional recording officers, who would deal with the records related to land transfer with the district collector.

The land transfer records (ROR-1B Adangal) would be made available online without the payment of any fee on www.meebhoomi.ap.gov.in portal.

The auto-mutation pilot project was taken up in Kankipadu mandal of Krishna district in 2019.

The government is making efforts to extend the facility to other districts.

With the introduction of the new system, land registration till the issuance of e-passbook would be made available online. Land owners will no longer need to approach the tahsildar ’s office or MeeSeva office for any transaction as they will be getting updates on their mobile phones.

Moreover, the process of tahsildar’s attestation, and the inclusion of their particulars in the revenue records now has to be completed within 30 days and the e-passbook will be issued immediately.

With the implementation of the auto-mutation, the government has taken another stride in land rights.

Till now, farmers had been running pillar to post for registration and other changes in their revenue records that was not only tedious but also fuelled corruption in revenue offices.

Deputy chief minister and minister for revenue Pilli Subhashchandra Bose, and senior officials of the revenue department were present on the occasion.

441,['12/02/2020'],"‘Join citizen policing, take photos of errant vehicles &amp; WhatsApp it to us’","This story is from February 12, 2020

Q. Street no. 9, Kamakshipuram, Ramanthapur, has become a spot for drug peddlers and notorious gangs. Every now and then they harass people from the locality. A few months ago, we approached the Uppal police and submitted a written complaint. But instead of giving us an acknowledgement for the report, cops said they don’t believe us. Till date, we have not received an acknowledgement and the nuisance continues. – Kaustubh Dongarkar

A. We received a written complaint regarding this five months ago. The moment we received the complaint, we made GD entry and increased patrolling. Every week, we are conducting special drives to nab drunk people creating trouble. Till now, we have booked 10 cases. Our course of action from today is to deploy exclusive patrol mobile and Blue Colt to monitor the area. We will increase visible policing in the area to control illegal activities. We will keep strict vigil on drug peddlers and arrest them. Regarding women safety, we are creating awareness through Dial 100 and WhatsApp control number 9490617111 and arranging meetings on the issue. Our prime objective is to ensure women safety. We will positively and strictly adhere to it.

Q. Residents of Ramanthapur have certain concerns: 1. Lack of CCTVs: Area from public school to Shivaji statue is full of liquor shops that pose a threat to women. It is a den for eve-teasers. Installation of CCTV cameras on the roads and inside Gokhale Nagar, Srinivaspuram, Endowment Colony, Venkatreddy Nagar, PS colony (which are thickly populated) will help as a deterrent. 2. Patrolling: Please deploy more patrolling teams on motorbikes so that they can easily reach narrow lanes and bylanes. – Arun Deshpande

A. At Endowment colony, there are 21 CCTV cameras and all are working. Srinivaspuram colony has no community cameras but Venkat Reddy Nagar has six government L&T cameras (non-live) and PS Colony has three of the same. Efforts are on to give ACT Fibernet connectivity to all non-live cameras. Meanwhile, Rs 4 lakh CDP fund has been sanctioned for Ghokul Enclave and approval for issue of PO is pending at collectorate. There is a wine shop and bar & restaurant side-by-side. Though the wine shop has cameras, they cover their own property. Further, we are encouraging communities to install CCTV cameras in their colonies either with the funds of local MLA/MP/MLC CDP or through contributions made within community following the public safety law enforcement act guidelines. Even individuals can install CCTV cameras that do not cost much under the Nenusahitam programme. We are geo-tagging all community and Nenusahitam CCTV cameras. Instructions have been issued to Uppal SHO to patrol the area with Blue Colt motorbikes at odd hours, as requested.

Q. There is a pressing need to install traffic signal near the RK Puram bus stand, as the traffic density there has increased by leaps and bounds, often causing bottlenecks. Constant honking causes immense disturbance to residents of adjoining Officers Colony. It is also a school zone. – Ajay Kumar R

A. We will discuss the issue with the engineering cell and GHMC officers for installing signals at RK Puram Bus stop. We will also arrange for a signboard that states ‘No Horn and School Zone’. Thank you for joining hands with Rachakonda Police.

Q. Though your office has a huge parking space, police vehicles have encroached a good part of the main road outside the commissionerate. Wonder why GHMC Malkajgiri is silent? – Dr GV Rao

A. Inside Rachakonda commissionerate premises, there is sufficient parking for police vehicles and visitors. In front of the commissionerate building, we had kept cones for the safety of pedestrians and commuters, as there are electrical poles and a transformer. However, recently we removed the cones and posted a constable to ensure free flow of traffic as the commissionerate building is adjacent to the main road.

Q. I have seen some private vehicles – cars and two-wheelers – displaying police stickers on their number plates and plying on the road. Is it not an offence? What is the punishment for this? – Minupuri

A. If anybody displays police stickers on their number plates, it is an offence under Section 80(a) of the AP MV Act, Sec 50, 51 of Central Motor Vehicle Act and r/w 177 of MV Act 1988. It attracts a penalty of Rs 200. Special drives are conducted to spot such vehicles and remove the stickers. However, citizens, too, can cooperate with us by sending photographs of such vehicle, if they spot them. They can send the photos to Rachakonda police either through WhatsApp 9490617111 or Hawk Eye app so that we can take appropriate action.

Q. Thank you for making Saroornagar a peaceful locality. However, I want to bring to your notice the traffic problems at Kothapet X Road. Although the traffic signals function normally, pedestrians, especially senior citizens and disabled people, face a lot of problems while crossing the junction. Reckless driving by bikers and haphazard parking are some of the offences. The free left is another issue as motorists seldom use indicators. – BS Patnaik

A. One SI and two traffic police constables are deployed at Kothapet X Road every day to regulate traffic. Until now, we have not received any complaints from commuters regarding traffic flow or pedestrians facing difficulty in crossing the road. However, we will conduct a special drive against traffic violators, particularly those resorting to rash driving, and deploy some more traffic personnel to ensure safety of road users. You are requested to join citizen policing by taking a photograph of such vehicles, if you spot them, and send it to Rachakonda police through WhatsApp (9490617111) or Hawk Eye app.

Q. Despite there being a police station at the LB Nagar crossing, there is complete chaos. The circle is occupied by private vehicles that obstruct the movement of people, while autos are seen parked right in the middle. Worse, there are no policemen to control them. – B Satish Goud

A. At LB Nagar police station, there is a narrow turning. From LB Nagar to Vijayawada bus stop, we have one SI, 3 PCs deployed every day to regulate traffic. There is also an inspector to supervise. Due to laying of an underpass, some inconvenience is caused now and then. But we are clearing it immediately and regulating traffic through a strict enforcement drive. However, your suggestion is well taken. We will conduct special drive against auto drivers that park on the carriageway at LB Nagar junction and also install signages.

Q. I am a resident of Saikrishna Enclave in Yapral. A weekly vegetable market is held every Friday on the road connecting Shaili Gardens to Jupally Homes & Registration Colony. The road is very narrow, and the vendors occupy both sides, causing great difficulty for motorists. I am not against anyone earning their livelihood, but I would request that the vegetable market be shifted to the double cemented road which is just 300-400 meters from the present spot. – Col SD Chandra Shaker (Retd).

A. We will write a letter to GHMC officials on encroachment by vendors and GHMC and traffic police officers will plan to visit to the place and remove the weekly market. Thank you for joining hands with Rachakonda Police.

Q. I am a resident of Vayupuri where 83% of heads of households are senior citizens, of which 23% are super senior citizens (over 80 year. Most of them live alone with their children either abroad or away from home. For their safety, we had suggested that only the centre road of the three parallel thoroughfare roads passing through the colony be open for unrestricted access and the other two be closed between 10.30pm and 5am every day. We also want all domestic help, others employed in houses to be checked for their antecedents and registered in the police station. – Wing Commander TJ Reddy, VSM (Retd)

A. Our officers have spoken to the petitioner TJ Reddy, Vayupuri society president, and met him in person about the complaint. The issue will be resolved in coordination with GHMC, keeping the safety and security of the 83% senior citizens in mind. We will take up the matter with GHMC authorities. Regarding antecedent verification of domestic help and others employed, we are going to start this project soon on lines of Delhi Police.

Q. Despite filing a complaint four month ago with Hayathnagar SHO about tampering of patta land records by Hayathnagar and Abdulapurmet MRO office after joining hands with land grabbers of Kuntloor village, no action has yet been taken. – T Kailash Ditya

A. SHO Hayatnagar has addressed a letter to the deputy collector-cum-executive magistrate tehsildar, Hayathnagar mandal. The letter had a request to furnish pahanis in respect of survey nos. 14, 21, 22, 23, 27, 90, 91 and 95 in Kuntloor village of Abdullapurmet mandal, RR district, for the year 1950 till date, proceeding no. B/2120/1991 dated 05.02.1994 and MRO proceeding no. ROR/3359/94, ROR B/17/98 dated 25.06.1998. It also sought to furnish details of changed pattadars names in above survey numbers. As per reply of tehsildar, Hayathnagar, there is no record available from 1994 to 1998.The records available from 1950 to 1993 in the pahani of pattadar column shows Vikramaditya Naidu and Devaraj Naidu’s name in survey nos. 14, 21, 22, 23, 27, and in the possession column it shows Raji Reddy’s name. Pahani of pattadar column shows Vikramaditya Naidu and Devaraj Naidu’s name in survey nos. 90, 91, 95 and the possession column shows Galanki Narayana’s name. The said changes were made in the year of 1998. Further, since the tehsildar has furnished a reply that “there is no record” available, unless we get the total records of the said survey numbers, finalising the matter is difficult. We will also address a letter to district collector, Rangareddy for resolving the issue.

Q. We filed a cheating case against Sriram Gopal (suspended inspector) 665/2017 in November 2017. It has been more than two-and-half years and yet the Chaitanyapuri police have not filed a chargesheet. Is there no deadline for filing a chargesheet? How many more years do I need to wait for justice? – Sateesh Thippirisetti

A.

BAREILLY: Two persons, including a woman, were found dead at platforms two and four of Bareilly Junction railway station on Tuesday, creating panic among passengers .

The autopsy report confirmed that the woman, who appears to be in her 40s, died due to infection in her intestine, while the man, nearly 60-year-old, died due to poisoning. Police found a railway ticket to New Delhi and Rs 150 in his pocket, while his belongings were missing. “The man died due to poisoning, while the woman died due to infection in her intestine. We are preparing a report, which will be submitted to the department concerned,” Dr Prakash Chandra Arya , a member of the autopsy team told TOI.

According to railway sources, police suspect the involvement of ‘ zeharkhurani ’ gang, which poisons rail and bus passengers and flees with their belongings.

GRP in charge Krishna Avtaar told TOI, “The woman was possibly a beggar. We have recovered several coins from her bag. However, no information could be gathered about the man, who had bought a ticket to New Delhi. We are yet to receive the autopsy report, but action will be taken if the man was poisoned.”

Nitin Gadkari

NAGPUR: In relief to Union minister Nitin Gadkari , the Nagpur bench of Bombay high court on Tuesday rejected an election petition filed by Manohar Dabrase, under the Representation of the People Act, 1951, challenging the former’s victory in Lok Sabha polls held in May last year.

Dabrase, who was one of the candidates, had prayed for declaring city MP’s victory null and void alleging non-compliance with various statutory provisions.

Gadkari had opposed the petition contending that there was non-disclosure of any cause of action for declaring his election void. He also pointed out that there was absence of material facts in Dabrase’s plea to prove his allegations that poll result was materially affected.

“In view of the petitioner’s failure to prove non-compliance under provisions of Constitution of India or provisions of the Representation of the People Act or any rules/orders framed under it, thereby materially affecting the election result, as far as respondent was concerned, the petition is liable to be summarily dismissed without trial,” Justice Atul Chandurkar held.

According to the petitioner, the final vote tally didn’t match and there was serious discrepancy in the grand total, which showed 786 votes more than the total votes polled. The difference between the votes polled and counted was unexplained. Thus, the electronic voting machines (EVMs) could not be trusted, Dabrase had argued.

The petitioner had earlier contended that out of over 19 lakh voters, about 11.86 lakh exercised their franchise in the May polls. While Dabrase polled 26,128 votes, Gadkari had secured 6.60 lakh and retained his seat.

The Bareilly district jail where 3 prisoners died in 3 days

BAREILLY: Four prisoners , serving sentences for separate cases of murder and kidnapping at two Bareilly jails, died within 72 hours, giving anxious moments to the jail authorities who wasted no time in clarifying that “all of them died due to age-related ailments”. After a panel of doctors conducted the postmortem, the bodies were handed over to the prisoners’ relatives.

As soon as the matter came to their notice, district magistrate Nitish Kumar and senior superintendent of police (SSP) Shailesh Kumar Pandey rushed to the jails — Central and district jails — to take stock of the situation and to ensure that inmates are getting all facilities they are entitled to under the jail manuals.

District jail senior superintendent UK Mishra told TOI, “It’s mere a coincident that three prisoners lodged here passed away in the past couple of days. We have all the required medical facilities available on the jail premises and in case of emergency, inmates are admitted to the jail hospital. However, if the need arises and anyone is required intensive medical attention, we shift him to the district hospital.”

One of the prisoners, Ramchandra (74) from Pilibhit, had killed five people in 2001 and was serving a sentence at the Central jail.

According to Ashok Sagar, jailer of the Central jail, Ramchandra was admitted to the district jail hospital on November 1 after he fell ill. However, when his condition started deteriorating, he was shifted to King George’s Medical University in Lucknow on January 29, said Sagar.

“Ramchandra was brought back to the Central jail after his condition improved. On February 8, he collapsed and was rushed to the district hospital, where he died during treatment. According to doctors, Ramcharan died due to ischemic heart disease (IHD) with senile degenerative changes,” added the jailor.

Similarly, on February 8, 58-year-old Ramautar, who was serving a life term in a murder case, collapsed at the district jail and was immediately shifted to the district hospital, where he died during treatment, said Mishra. “Doctors said Ramautar died due to cardiogenic shock due to acute myocardial infarction (heart attack).”

Another prisoner at the district hospital, Hardwari (87), who was also serving life imprisonment in a murder case, was undergoing treatment for age-related ailments at the jail hospital. He, however, passed away on February 9 due to hypertension and delirium, said Mishra.

The fourth prisoner at the district jail, Rajnish (35), died on Monday. “Rajnish, who was serving a sentence for abducting a girl in Budaun , was admitted to the district hospital on Monday. He was speaking with his sister sitting next to him when all of sudden he complained of chest pain and died,” added Mishra.

Five accidents have been reported since the Tallah diversions started

KOLKATA: The local police, along with Shyambazar and Ultadanga traffic guards, have taken several measures to ensure the area near Tallah Bridge does not witness a sudden spurt in accidents. The razing of the bridge has led to several route diversions , as a result of which, certain roads, such as Canal Road and Belgachhia Road, are being forced to handle more vehicles than usual.

Not only the number of traffic cops on the road has gone up significantly, the local police station has also deployed their officers at key points, such as RG Kar Hospital and Belgachia Metro station, to ensure smooth flow of vehicles and restriction on jay walking. “In case an accident takes place there, these cops can take the victims to hospital without wasting time,” said an officer. Sergeants have been told to keep an eye on bus drivers and timers at certain traffic signals have been “moderated” to cater to the rush of vehicles on certain directions.

“There is a perception that more accidents are taking place because of the new diversions. But the number is actually well within control,” said an IPS officer at Lalbazar, quick to add that “even one accident was not an option”. Later, DC (traffic) Rupesh Kumar told TOI cops had been ensuring that all the traffic rules were being enforced in the Tallah zone. “Buses must stop at designated stops. Illegal overtaking will not be allowed,” said Kumar. Sources said that as traffic flow had somewhat stabilized in the area and waiting time minimized drastically, it was “time for stricter implementation of traffic laws”.

Ever since the route diversions were started, five accidents had been reported from this zone, two of them being fatal. The latest accident took place when a 52-year-old resident of J K Ghosh Road, Ruksana Khatoon, was reportedly grievously injured while trying to alight from a bus in front of the Belgachia Metro station last Saturday. “The complainant was travelling from Rajabazar was about to alight from the bus near Belgachia Metro station when the driver suddenly swerved right, throwing the woman onto the road. She was admitted to SSKM Hospital with a hip fracture,” an officer said.

Earlier, a 48-year-old man, Md Nehal, riding pillion on a bike, died when a bus hit the two-wheeler from behind and ran him over. In the second fatal accident, a bus on the Bagbazar-Garia route ran over a Titagarh resident, Loknath Ghosh, on Ultadanga Main Road.

Agra: A 41-year-old retired Army man was allegedly shot dead by his teenage daughter after he opened fire at her and his wife, injuring them seriously in Mathura’s Mitthauli village, late on Monday. Police said the shootout followed a heated argument in the family.

According to police, Chetram Singh, who served as a Naik in the Jat Regiment and retired six years ago, took out his pistol in a fit of rage and shot at his 38-year-old wife and 17-year-old daughter (name withheld). As he turned the weapon to shoot his 13-year-old son, the injured girl pounced on him and managed to snatch the weapon from his hands. She then opened fire, killing her father on the spot.

Both Chetram’s wife and his daughter are battling for their lives at a private hospital. Police said they were waiting for them to be able to record their statements.

Circle officer Alok Dubey said while one bullet scraped the woman’s right eyebrow, the girl sustained gunshot wounds in the abdomen. Chetram was shot in his chest and abdomen, police said. His body has been sent for post-mortem.

Police said the girl, who is taking coaching classes in Allahabad, had come home two days back. Her younger brother is studying in class IX in Mathura.

Mathura deputy inspector general of police Shalabh Mathur said police recovered one pistol, two magazines, three live cartridges along with two empty ones from the spot. He said Chetram was said to be angry over his daughter’s alleged affair with a local youth. “We are inquiring the matter in detail,” he said.

Meanwhile, a case was filed on Tuesday under sections 302 (murder), 307 (attempt to murder) and 506 (criminal intimidation) of IPC at Naujheel police station on the basis of a complaint filed by the deceased’s brother.

452,['12/02/2020'],Delhi: Victory gives Arvind Kejriwal’s idea of ‘alternative politics’ a big boost,"This story is from February 12, 2020

The big win gives Arvind Kejriwal a chance to showcase initiatives

NEW DELHI: Aam Aadmi Party’s victory has given a new lease of life to the idea of ‘alternative politics’ that CM Arvind Kejriwal has tried to woo the voters with since its birth as an offshoot of the Anna Hazare movement.

Complete coverage on Delhi elections

Though AAP for now is seen to be a Delhi phenomenon, its victory keeps alive the possibility of its expansion, at least in states like Punjab and Haryana, where it once eyed prospects. More importantly, the big win gives Kejriwal a chance to showcase initiatives, something he failed to do fully with much of his tenure spent in duelling with the Centre.

Despite its small size and limited powers, Delhi gives incumbent CMs a stage and the attention that leaders of bigger states fail to gain. A new set of initiatives and programmes can revive the ‘Kejriwal model’ at a time when the non-BJP space is fractured with Congress’ centrality in the opposition diminished.

For now, AAP is expected to focus on Delhi, but it will not be wrong to assume Kejrwal may see the victory as an opportunity to make forays elsewhere. It was once seen as an emerging force in Punjab before it lost momentum, partly due to its dalliance with extremist sympathisers in the state.

A repeat win, and a landslide at that, is seen by AAP functionaries as evidence the party is not a passing event.

The celebration of the win by the anti-BJP camp as a rebuff to Shaheen Bagh-centred polarisation gives the victory added value, which the chief minister will be well aware of.

AAP’s outreach to the ‘aam aadmi’ lies in its brand of populism such as subsidies on water and power like the ‘zero bill’ for those consuming up to 200 units of electricity and a narrative around quality education and health facilities. Also, it constantly seeks to project itself as pro-poor.

Though the political maths of these elections reflect a bipolar contest, AAP managed to capture votes from across sections — the poor, middle classes, minorities and segments like traders, professionals and larger communities like the Poorvanchalis. In 2015 too, AAP’s victory was gained through voting across usual loyalties.

In the past, AAP’s bid to make a mark nationally during the 2014 and 2019 Lok Sabha polls failed. Its four MPs in Punjab are now one and Delhi remains blank. But while most thought AAP’s performance in Lok Sabha polls would weigh heavily on the outcome of the Delhi assembly result, its feat makes it evident that it is not a chance winner.

That AAP’s political equation with the Centre has been rather turbulent and differences very strong over various policy decisions, Kejriwal may well temper his actions, seeking to implement some key initiatives while distinguishing himself from BJP if his swift adoption of Hindu symbolism is anything to go by.

Representative image

KOLHAPUR: The Tasgaon police arrested a grapes dealer on February 6 for cheating 14 farmers to the tune of Rs 70 lakh by purchasing grapes from them without paying them.

Police said that the cheating happened in 2010, adding that the suspect was nabbed from his native place in Madurai, Tamil Nadu.

The arrested suspect has been identified as A. Ganeshan (41), a resident of Madurai.

Police said that a complaint in this regard was registered by Dinesh Madhavrao Pawar, a resident of Tasgaon, in 2010.

Police said that farmers usually grow fruits in their agricultural lands. When the fruit ripens, traders or middlemen visit the fields and offer deals to the farmers. Once the deal is sealed, they take fruits to the market for sale and then once all the fruits are sold, they pay the said amount to the farmers.

According to police, Dinesh had grown grapes on his 10-acre land in 2010. At the time, Ganeshan visited Tasgaon where he came in contact with Dinesh. The suspect sealed a deal with Dinesh and offered him a price more than other dealers. Realising that the price offered by Ganeshan was more what other dealers offered at the time, Dinesh convinced 13 more farmers. A total of 14 farmers sold their grapes worth Rs 70 lakh to Ganeshan.

“The suspect agreed to pay a certain amount to each farmer after selling the grapes in market. However, he later refused to clear the farmers’ dues. The farmers then contacted Dinesh who had to clear the dues of the farmers’ using his own funds,” said police.

Dinesh later rushed to the nearest police station and lodged a complaint against Ganeshan who was missing since then. However, he was recently arrested from his native place.

The suspect has been remanded in magisterial custody, said police.

Agra: The father of a teenage girl, who was raped in August 2019 in Shikohabad town of UP’s Firozabad district, was shot dead outside his house allegedly by the rape accused after he refused to withdraw the rape case against him. Following the murder late on Monday, the inspector general of police (Agra range) on Tuesday suspended three policemen, including the SHOs of Uttar and Shikohabad police stations, for “inaction” despite two FIRs in the case.

The kin of the 37-year-old deceased said that the rape accused, who is a history-sheeter with nine cases against him, had threatened the victim twice to withdraw the case.

“He was continuously pressuring my brother to withdraw rape case and threatened to kill him if he did not comply. On February 1, my brother gave a written complaint against him at Uttar police station, after which an FIR under IPC’s sections 504 (intentional insult with intent to provoke breach of the peace) and 506 (punishment for criminal intimidation) was lodged, but police failed to arrest him,” the brother of the deceased said.

According to police, the accused is neighbour of the rape survivor, who was studying in class XI, when she was raped in Shambu Nagar of Shikohabad in August last year.

The accused, identified as Achman Upadhyay, who has also been booked under the Gangsters Act, has been on the run ever since. The IG announced a reward of Rs 50,000 on him on Tuesday.

Satish Ganesh, IG (Agra range), said, “Even after two FIRs, including one of rape which was lodged in August 2019 at Shikohabad, in which a chargesheet was also filed, local police failed to arrest the accused history-sheeter. Thus, fixing their responsibilities, I have suspended inspectors Keshav D Sharma, Lokendra Singh and sub-inspector Ashesh Kumar, who was incharge of Kotla police outpost.”

A resident of Tilaknagar area, the deceased, who used to work as an electrician, was shot in the back with a country-made pistol.

BAREILLY: The Sambhal sub-divisional magistrate (SDM) has issued notices to 13 people for provoking women to assemble in large numbers at a ground in Nakhasa area and organize a sit-in against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA). All 13 have been instructed to submit personal bonds of Rs 50 lakh along with two guarantors for the amount, with police.

SDM Rajesh Kumar said notices were issued to 13 persons as precautionary measure, in order to ensure law and order in the district. He told TOI, “We’ve got intelligence reports that behind the staging of the sit-in by Muslim women at Pakka Bagh, were some people who provoked them. Such actions pose threat to law and order in the district. Following LIU reports, the 13 people were issued notices giving them seven day to reply. We will examine their explanation, and initiate further course of action after that.”

The SDM said each and every person issued notice would have to submit a personal bond of Rs 50 lakh, along with two guarantors who would take surety of the amount.

459,['12/02/2020'],Demand for hearing property cases in city gathers steam,"This story is from February 12, 2020

Aurangabad: Ever since the MahaRERA came into effect in 2017, stakeholders have to go all the way to Mumbai and Pune for hearing the disputes related to their properties. There has been a clarion call from stakeholders that proceedings for the Marathwada division be heard separately at Aurangabad city on a regular basis.

Senior lawyer and president of advocacy group Marathwada Janta Vikas Parishad, Pradeep Deshmukh, said on Tuesday said that at least 15% of the complaints that MahaRERA received were from Marathwada.

“The state government must ensure that MahaRERA hearings are conducted in all the places where benches of the Bombay high court have been established. This logic was followed while setting up different tribunals in the past. Hearing of cases related to MahaRERA must take place in keeping with this precedence,” said Deshmukh.

The Government of India had enacted the Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act 2016, which came into effect from May 1, 2017, soon after which the Maharashtra Real Estate Regulatory Authority (MahaRERA) also came into force.

As per MahaRERA, any aggrieved buyer can file a complaint with the competent authority or the adjudicating officer with respect to any registered real estate project, for any violation or contravention of the provisions of the RERA or the rules and regulations associated with it. The authority is expected to establish an adjudicating mechanism for speedy redressal of such complaints. Any person aggrieved by any direction or decision or order made by MahaRERA or by an adjudicating officer may file an appeal before the appellate tribunal. In case the buyer is still aggrieved with the decision or order of the tribunal, he can file an appeal with the high court.

All the hearings related to the aforementioned procedures for Marathwada division have been held at Mumbai or Pune so far.

Omkar Joshi, regional secretary of the consumer protection group Akhil Bhartiya Grahak Panchyat, said hearing cases in Mumbai and Pune would deprive stakeholders the benefits of MahaRERA.

“Marathwada is one of the largest real estate sectors in Maharashtra. Unlike other metros, Aurangabad and some of the prominent towns in Marathwada do face the problem of lack of space. Therefore, a rapid growth in the real estate sector can be observed here. Hence, it is imperative to have a unit of MahaRERA functioning in the region,” said Joshi.

BJP MLA Atul Save he would demand the decentralized functioning of MahaRERA when it comes to conducting hearings. “A common man, as an aggrieved buyer, cannot afford spending time and money and arrange for multiple visits to Mumbai or Pune for the hearings on property disputes,” said Save.

When contacted, Shiv Sena MLA Sanjay Shirsath said he would raise the demand for MahaRERA hearings at Aurangabad during the upcoming budget session of the state legislature. “Complainants have to face many hurdles while following the hearings in Mumbai and Pune. The MahaRERA is still in its nascent stages and must be developed through proper policy decisions from time to time,” he said.

An official e-mail sent to MahaRERA remained unanswered till Tuesday evening.

Kolhapur: Rajarampuri police have booked two people for allegedly cheating a man of Rs 95 lakh by offering to purchase his share from a sugar refinery and clearing the loan that he had borrowed from the bank.

Police said that they are investigating the case and have not made any arrests so far.

The suspects have been booked under section 406 (punishment for criminal breach of trust), 420 (cheating and dishonestly inducing delivery of property) and 409 (criminal breach of trust by public servant, or by banker, merchant or agent) of the Indian Penal Code.

According to police, the complainant and five others, including one of the suspects, set up a sugar company in 2003. The head office of the company was set up at Shivaji Udyamnagar in Kolhapur . They appointed a managing director (second suspect) to look after the daily operations of the company. The company officials borrowed loan amounting to Rs 1.10 crore from a nationalised bank and started their operations. Soon, the company began generating profits.

Later, the managing director and the second suspect told the complainant that they want to expand the business and the complainant borrowed a loan amounting to Rs 95 lakh from the same bank and gave it to the suspects.

The duo then devised a plan. They told the complainant that they wish to buy the company from him and for that they even offered to clear his loan. The complainant agreed to the proposal and transferred his rights to the suspects. However, the complainant later realised that the suspects had not cleared the second loan amounting to Rs 95 lakh. Realising that he is being duped, he lodged a complaint with Rajarampuri police station.

Vijayawada: Former chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu on Tuesday claimed that the state has lost investments worth Rs 1,80,000 crore in the last nine months due to anti-industry atmosphere and indifferent attitude of the government.

He alleged YSRC leaders were threatening companies for employment, contracts and dealerships.

Speaking at a state-level meeting of the party leaders here, Naidu said his government attracted investments worth Rs 70,000 crore for Adani data centre, Rs 50,000 crore for Singapore consortium project, Reliance IT companies at a cost of Rs 15,000 crore, paper and pulp industry in Prakasam district costing Rs 25,000 crore, Lulu convention centre Rs 3,000 crore, besides BR Shetty hospitals, Franklin Templeton and Fintech valley companies in Visakhapatnam. Now all the investors have withdrawn due to the prevailing indifferent attitude in the state.

Naidu said the YSRC government was trying to kill the world-class capital Amaravati by resorting to false propaganda in the name of insider trading. The government has created hurdles for the construction of Polavaram project, Naidu said and added that central government rejected release of funds in the name of pending audit report.

Naidu alleged that the state government was trying to acquire 6116 acres of land in Visakhapatnam that belonged to retired army personnel and weaker sections. He accused YSRC leaders of grabbing 33,000 acres of land around Visakhapatnam and added that the TDP fact-finding committee would give its report soon.

It was not clear how many have been screened or tested for the infection that has infected over 42,000 people and lead to more 1,000 across the globe.On Tuesday, health minister Tulsi Silawat instructed his department to advertise for recruitment of 1,700 doctors in Madhya Pradesh. Also, doctors who have been suspended in the last six months, be reinstated in ‘public interest’, said Silawat. Around three dozen doctors are expected to benefit from the move.More 5,000 nurses and paramedical staff will also be appointed to strengthen medical services in Madhya Pradesh. MP is well short of specialised doctors and other essential staff for medical services.State health department services are yet to comply with best practices related to Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV).Dealing with other influenza contagions like H1N1 for over a decade, health department nor DME run tertiary care hospitals are relying on infrared temperature guns. “Why do we need infrared temperature guns at Hamidia hospital. There has been no case of 2019-nCoV. For patients with acute respiratory infections there are isolation wards and we use separate conventional body temperature meters,” said a senior consultant at Gandhi medical college (GMC) when asked about the use of infrared meters. Territory care and district hospitals and many private hospitals follow the same method.Union government issued guidelines clearly state standard precautions to be followed at all patient care areas. It includes ‘avoid sharing of equipment’. Other instructions are on hand hygiene, gloves and use of personal protective equipment (PPE) to avoid direct contact with patient’s blood, body fluids, secretions and non-intact skin, prevention of needle stick/sharp injury and cleaning and disinfection of the environment and equipment.Widespread screening of people with deadly virus, except at some airports, is taking place without prescribed temperature guns, a device with ability to measure temperature from a distance.Earlier on Jan 30, MP integrated disease surveillance project (IDSP) had directed hospitals to purchase digital infrared meters. IDSP main function includes IT enabled disease surveillance system for epidemic prone diseases to monitor disease trends and to detect and respond to outbreaks in early rising phase through trained Rapid Response Team (RRTs).11-people with a travel history to China were first let to go out of hospital and placed under ‘home quarantine’ within incubation period, a time when they could infect others.“Doctors and medical staff has been deployed for their regular check-up. Their samples were not sent to NIV Pune,” said CMHO Gwalior, Dr SK Verma. Most are students with a travel history to China. They were first reported on Feb 1.NCDC does not have a policy on home quarantine. However, patients who are suspected are kept in isolation and will be given a telephone or other method of communication in the isolation room/area to enable patients or family members/visitors to communicate with nurses inside the facility, as per NCDC guidelines.",bhopal,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74099781,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-86989,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/govt-to-revoke-suspension-of-docs-appoint-1700-new-ones/articleshow/74089602.cms

Nirmala Sitharaman

HYDERABAD: Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman said the Union government had released tax devolution funds to the tune of Rs 85,013 crore in six years, including Rs 13,009.40 crore (up to February 5, 2019-20) to Telangana .

Answering a question posed by Bhuvanagiri MP Komatireddy Venkat Reddy on the release of central funds to Telangana on Monday, the minister said Telangana had been a revenue surplus state since 2014-15 but in the last few years, the state’s debts have gone up. The quantum of assistance in the last six years under various grants was around Rs 51,298.84 crore.

In her reply, she said Telangana received Rs 6,511 crore for local bodies, another Rs 3,853 crore for rural development and Rs 1,500 crore for women welfare. The Centre also granted Rs 1,916 crore for development of backward districts and Rs 1,289 crore towards disaster management fund.

Meanwhile, TRS in a press statement said the false propaganda by Congress and BJP on Telangana economy was clearly exposed in the Lok Sabha .

It said the debt-GSDP ratio from 2014-15 to 2019-20, though on a rising trend, was within the envelope as prescribed by the 14th Finance Commission for its award period and was also in line with the medium term fiscal policy statement of the Telangana government.

“The Union finance minister clearly stated in her reply that Telangana macro economy is sound,” the party said. It further said the minister’s statement is a “slap in the face” of all those who were trying to cast aspersions on the financial condition of the state.

“I thank the people of Delhi. I thank our party workers for their hard work. I accept the mandate of people and congratulate Arvind Kejriwal. I hope he’ll perform as per the expectations of the people… Delhi must have given the mandate after careful thinking,” Tiwari said while addressing a press conference at his residence.

He, however, added that the vote share of BJP has increased from 32% to about 38% this assembly polls. “We’ll evaluate the reasons why we couldn’t perform well. Results may be below our expectations, but I would urge party workers not to get disheartened. Compared with 2015, our winning percentage has increased this time. Delhi did not reject us, and the increase in vote share is a good sign,” said the Delhi BJP chief.

He also took a dig at Congress, which again failed to open its account. “Delhi is now witnessing a new trend. A different kind of politics, which involves two parties, has started in the national capital and we will have to make our preparations accordingly. Congress has now become extinct.”

Over allegations of BJP indulging in politics of hate levelled by senior AAP functionary Manish Sisodia, the Northeast Delhi MP said that BJP only talks about sabka saath, sabka vikas, and not hate.

Earlier in the day, the BJP chief had claimed that his party could win even 55 seats. On Saturday, Tiwari had tweeted that BJP could win as many as 48 seats. Negating the exit polls, he had asked people to “save his tweet”.

466,['12/02/2020'],Can AAP replicate its Delhi success in U’khand?,"Dehradun: Arvind Kejriwal-led Aam Aadmi Party ( AAP ) secured a thumping majority in Delhi assembly polls on Tuesday. The landslide victory in the national capital has given a boost to the hopes of party workers in Uttarakhand as well, even though the party has been struggling for a while in the Himalayan state.Aam Aadmi Party, which first tested the poll waters in Uttarakhand during the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, showed some promise initially but couldn’t secure wins primarily due to what analysts claimed were issues like internal bickering, lack of attention from senior party leaders including Kejriwal, and tough competition from the Congress and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) who are the two principal players in the state's politics.After its candidates failed to perform well in the 2014 general elections, the party decided to keep away from the 2017 assembly elections.AAP’s win in Delhi has now raised the question if the party can revive itself in the state. “We did not fare well in Lok Sabha polls of 2014 and somewhere down the line, lost the plot. However, the overwhelming win in Delhi assembly polls has raised hope of the party’s revival in Uttarakhand,” AAP state secretary Rajesh Bahuguna told TOI. He added that he would be speaking to the party’s state in-charge Rakesh Sinha to work out an extensive plan for the state. “We can definitely replicate the “Delhi model” to win the trust of people in Uttarakhand,” said Bahuguna.AAP volunteer Hari Simran Singh pointed out two reasons behind AAP’s weak performance in the state. “Firstly, we did not contest the 2017 assembly polls. This demoralised many volunteers. Secondly, our volunteers are not full-time politicians and we meet only on weekends. The party requires more interactions and meetings. Both these factors reduced the party’s prospects,” said Singh, while adding that AAP's win in Delhi has considerably raised the morale of state party members. “We are planning to hold a major meeting soon to discuss a plan to strengthen the party at block level. We will also discuss the “Delhi model” in this meeting and how it can be implemented in Uttarakhand,” added Singh.Political analysts meanwhile said that in the absence of any prominent regional party, AAP has the potential to provide an alternative to people seeking change from the BJP and the Congress. Political expert Jay Singh Rawat said, “Be it Lok Sabha or assembly elections, it has always been a direct fight between the Congress and the BJP in Uttarakhand. These two parties have ruled the state for the last 20 years. AAP can become a good option provided its leaders work out their differences and reach out to people, especially in the hills, regarding their vision for the state.”",dehradun,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-47529300,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-110164,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/can-aap-replicate-its-delhi-success-in-ukhand/articleshow/74088038.cms

Solar plates at upper lake. pics

Bhopal: The Bhopal Smart City Development Corporation Limited (BSCDCL) and Bhopal Municipal Corporation (BMC) are making different claims with regard to operation of solar power projects along Upper Lake. While the BSCDCL claimed that trial-run of solar powered water pumping at Karbala pumping station has commenced, the claim was dismissed by civic officials working at the plant.

The state government has mooted a proposal on ‘Right to Water’. Energy efficiency is a major component of the ambitious plan.

Implementation of the solar-powered water pumping station is in limbo. The private company entrusted to deliver has skipped deadlines. The much-hyped project was supposed to be completed in early 2019.

BSCDCL claims by engineers that Karbala pumping was being solar powered was negated by BMC officials. However, street lights along VIP road are being lit up by solar power, BSCDCL claimed. “500 KW of the 750 KW capacity is being supplied to Karbala pumping station,” said a BSCDCL spokesperson.

“I am not aware of the situation. There is delay in execution, which should be looked into by relevant government agencies,” said mayor, Alok Sharma.

When contacted, BSCDCL officials did not respond.

The 750 KW solar power plant installation, which is in progress on Upper Lake alongside VIP road, is meant to power the Karbala pump house. Initially, 500 KW of the solar plant is to be set up on the Upper Lake boundary. The plant’s power pump house near Karbala will save around Rs 40 lakh annually. The solar power plant is being set up in collaboration with Madhya Pradesh Energy Development Corporation. At the time of the installation, it was understood that neither BMC nor BSCDCL would have to fork out a significant amount, as under the terms, the private company would bear the cost and maintain the plant for 25 years.

Karbala Raw Water Pumping Station has two 750 HP pumps. One would be powered by solar energy for lifting raw water to Idgah Hills filtration plant. This would save around 13,000 units of electricity.

As per the water supply energy audit report of Bhopal, there are 21 pumping stations with 126 pumps pumping water to the entire BMC area. In Bhopal, water supply loss amounts to as much as 15-30% combining overhead losses, treatment losses and distribution losses. Energy bill for supply of water per month is about Rs 50-70 crore.

Last year, I completed a hike in the Grand Canyon National Park, Arizona, with one of my friends and it proved to be life-altering. It’s called the rim-to-rim hike – among the most strenuous hikes in the world covering 22 miles (35km). But every kilometre is dotted with beautiful waterfalls, ranches, camp sites and sunset points. Most people take three to four days to complete the hike, as it’s challenging and involves travelling through harsh weather conditions and dust.

We, however, decided to challenge ourselves and complete it in a day. This was my first time hiking the Grand Canyon and by far the longest too. The hike to Phantom Ranch was amazing and not too difficult. We took a break there to soak our feet in the water and put on a new pair of socks (highly recommend). Once we crossed the Colorado River, the trail started to go up hill. But it still wasn’t very difficult. It was the last five miles of switchbacks that seemed to be never ending! It took us five hours to cover. But the feeling of making it to the end was amazing.

So, anyone willing to take on this hike, go for it. Only piece of advice: Do not get discouraged. Keep walking and taking small breaks in between. Because the hike is worth every bit of your perseverance.

BAREILLY: A 34-year-old man allegedly shot at and hacked to death his wife and 4-year-old daughter with a sickle in Fardhan area of Lakhimpur Kheri district on Monday night. He has been booked for murder and police are searching for him as he is on the run.

Accused has been identified as Saroj Mishra , a farmer. He was married to Aarti (27) nearly five years ago. Aarti often went to her maternal home to get away from her husband, a habitual wife-beater,.

Late on Monday night, Saroj first shot at his wife and daughter, who were sleeping, and later hacked them with a sickle. Saroj fled after the incident. Police said his father had died under mysterious circumstances and his body was found near a pond outside village about a month ago.

Neighbours said they heard a gunshot report from the house. Then, they heard a woman screaming for help. Someone immediately informed police. When police arrived, they found the Aarti and her daughter lying in a pool of blood in the house while Saroj was missing.

Sources claimed that Saroj was allegedly having an affair with another woman in the village and had quarrelled with Aarti on Monday night over the matter. Police have collected evidence from the spot and recorded the statements of neighbours.

An FIR in this case was registered under IPC section 302 (murder) and 506 (criminal intimidation) at Fardhan police station by Aarti’s brother, Rajan Awasthi .

Vimal Gautam, SHO of Fardhan police station, told TOI, “A woman and her daughter were brutally killed inside their house. During investigation, we found the man of the house had allegedly killed his wife and daughter because of his extra marital affair. The accused is absconding but we will arrest him soon.

Three of the four first-timers of Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) emerged victorious in Delhi assembly elections

NEW DELHI: Three of the four first-timers of Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) emerged victorious on Tuesday while only one of eight BJP candidates managed to win on their poll debuts.

Complete coverage on Delhi elections

The AAP candidates who won their first election were Dharampal Lakra from Mundka, Raj Kumar Anand from Patel Nagar and Virender Singh Kadian from Delhi Cantonment. Deepak Singla from Vishwas Nagar lost on an AAP ticket. Congress, which witnessed a drubbing worse than 2015, had given tickets to 14 first-timers, but drew a blank.

Lakra, who trumped BJP’s Azad Singh by 19,158 votes, was the richest candidate from Delhi with a declared wealth of nearly Rs 300 crore.

Lakra, who switched from Congress in 2014, fought an election for the first time. In Patel Nagar — a reserved constituency that has mostly upper middle class colonies — AAP’s Raaj Kumar Anand defeated Parvesh Ratn of BJP by 30,935 votes.

Virender Singh, a retired Air Force officer, won from Delhi Cantonment by 10,950 votes. He defeated BJP’s Manish Singh.

The only BJP candidate who won on debut was Ajay Mahawar, defeating AAP’s Shridutt Sharma by 28,400 votes in Ghonda constituency. The district party president from north-east Delhi, Mahawar has been associated with BJP for the past 20 years.

Mahawar, who was active in student politics in Kolkata earlier, promised to resolve the issue of traffic snarls and parking space.

“I managed to win the election with a huge margin because people wanted change. Since congestion is a huge issue in the area after the opening of the Signature Flyover, I want to resolve this. I will also construct a parking lot and increase DTC bus routes for the area,” he said.

The newbie BJP candidates who lost this time included Sunil Yadav (New Delhi), Anil Goyal (Krishna Nagar), Ashish Sood (Janakpuri), Parvesh Ratn (Patel Nagar), Ravi Negi (Patparganj), Sardar Impreet Singh Bakshi (Jangpura) and Tajinder Pal Bagga (Harinagar).

Congress first-timers who lost were Akansha Ola (Model Town), Ali Mehndi (Mustafabad), Amandeep Singh Sudan (Rajouri Garden), Anveeksha Tripathi Jain (Babarpur), Gaurav Dhanak (Karol Bagh — SC), JS Nayol (Shalimar Bagh), Mandeep Singh (Nangloi Jat), Priyanka Singh (RK Puram), Radhika Khera (Janakpuri), Siddharth Kundu (Narela), Shubham Sharma (Tughlaqabad), Sukhbir Singh Pawar (Greater Kailash), Romesh Sabarwal (New Delhi) and Rocky Tuseed (Rajinder Nagar).

Work on the level-crossing at the Chitpore railway yard on in full swing

KOLKATA: The police are keeping their fingers crossed even as the PWD are racing ahead to complete the work on the level-crossing at the Chitpore railway yard, hopefully before the boards exams start in mid-February. While the lane widening and strengthening and concretization of the stretch near the railway tracks are almost over, work on the tracks by the railways is on in full swing. The gateman’s room has also come up.

The proposed new road will connect Braja Dayal Shah Road next to the Cossipore bridge with Sethpukur Road and Prankrishna Mukherjee Road, with the traffic merging with BT Road, closer to Shyambazar. It is aimed at providing relief to goods vehicles, which are now not allowed for most part of the day.

“Madhyamik exams will begin on February 18. We hope the level-crossing will be handed to us by month-end. The PWD is, however, yet to share their final plans with us. As such, we are making our Madhyamik preparations based on both scenarios: the availability and non-availability of the level-crossing,” said an officer at Lalbazar.

Police said the road would be crucial for traffic flow in the morning, when vehicles would be allowed on both directions. “While trucks can use the level-crossing to enter the Chitpore terminal, smaller vehicles can use it if the Belgachhia bridge witnesses too much jam,” said an officer.

Police already have a detailed study of traffic on two key roads — Prankrishna Mukherjee Road and Seth Pukur Road adjoining Lockgate flyover and leading to Tallah bridge—on this segment. It will be useful when a plan is readied to finalise the route for vehicles once the level-crossing is built.

The state had earlier consulted the railways to ensure there was no operational glitch and that necessary clearances made available from the railway board before the level-crossing was built. Cops said they were also trying to see if the Khagen Chatterjee Street connecting Gopal Lal Thakur Road could be utilized for two-way movement during the boards exams. “Any plan would involve a peak-hour traffic study. None of the alternatives at hand offers us the space to run both-way traffic,” an officer said.

RAMPUR: As the local administration and court-appointed commissioners were busy evaluating the assets left by erstwhile Rampur Nawab after which they will be distributed among the heirs, a war of words erupted on Tuesday between two inheritors as one of them accused the other of selling his share of property. Interestingly, the local court is yet to take a call on the share of assets which will go to the heirs.

A press conference was called on Tuesday by Khasbagh Palace resident Nawab Muhammad Ali Khan his elder sister Naghat Abedi and they accused Noor Mahal resident Kazim Ali Khan of selling portion of properties way back in 2016, even as the decision of the asset distribution was pending in court.

They alleged that Kazim Ali sold out “his property share” to a Mumbai-based buyer Fareed Ahmed Qureshi before the Supreme Court judgment was pronounced into the matter.

Soon after the press conference, Kazim Ali Khan denied the charges. In a press release, Kazim said, “I did not sell my property share. However, they (Muhammad Ali Khan and Naghat Abedi) have lost their mind after losing the case.”

Eight months after the Supreme Court passed judgment for the division of the property among the family members of the erstwhile Rampur Nawab, the locks of Armoury were opened on February 3 to count the weapons kept in the family’s Khasbagh Palace in the presence of administrative officials and the erstwhile royal family members.

The process to open the locks of strong room of Khasbagh Palace in Rampur were opened on Saturday in presence of court-appointed commissioners and family members of erstwhile Rampur Nawab on Friday.

Aurangabad: The Maharashtra Real Estate Regulatory Authority (MahaRERA) has received more than 10,000 complaints since its inception in May 2017. So far, the regulatory authority has passed orders in 7,456 cases.

Civic activist Abhijit Dhanorkar said people were pinning their hopes on MahaRERA to emerge as an effective body for protecting the interests of property buyers.

“Recently, the MahaRERA has delivered a few landmark rulings, which will have far-reaching effects on the real estate sector in Maharashtra. We hope that the regulatory body emerges as a strong weapon in the hands of property buyers and must not get reduced to the level of other judicial mechanisms having high-pendency,” said Dhanorkar.

Secretary of Confederation of Real Estate Developers’ Associations of India (CREDAI), Aurangabad, Sunil Bedmutha said that efforts were being taken to establish a self-regulatory organization (SRO) as directed by the MahaRERA.

“Once established, the SRO is expected to streamline different practices among the promoters, which in turn will benefit customers. The proposed SRO is expected to have at least 500 MahaRERA registered projects. We appeal to non-CREDAI members to share the details of their registered project with us in order to reach the desired benchmark of 500 projects,” said Bedmutha. Credai’s Aurangabad chapter currently has around 175 members.

As per a circular issued by the MahaRERA, the SRO is expected to encourage its members to comply with the provisions of the RERA, applicable rules, regulations, orders and circulars issued by the regulator from time to time. The SRO is also expected to carry out awareness and education activities among its members among other responsibilities.-Prasad Joshi

477,['12/02/2020'],"K’taka pays less than 5% edu budget outlay towards RTE fees, says report","This story is from February 12, 2020

Bengaluru: Karnataka accounted for the third highest number of children studying in private schools under the 25% Right To Education quota, but was seventh when it came to the fee reimbursed by the government to each beneficiary student.

This is according to the Bright Spot Report : Status of Social Inclusion, published recently by Delhi-headquartered NGO Indus Action.

The data pertains to 2018-19, a year before the Karnataka government diluted the RTE quota, saying it was incurring a huge financial burden in reimbursing schools. The new Karnataka RTE norms provide for reservation in private schools only if no seat is available in government or aided institutions near the applicant’s residence.

Following the dilution, the number of RTE seats in the state has come down from around 1.5 lakh to 17,718, thus bringing down admissions by 92.7%. The new norm has been challenged in the Supreme Court. Indus Action, that works in enabling children to gain access to their right to education, has criticised Karnataka’s dilution of RTE norms. It says one of the state’s arguments is that from 2012 to March 2019, Rs 1,300 crore had been paid to private schools. Instead, that fee could have been used to provide quality education in government institutions.

“(But) the share of funds allotted to private schools is small when compared to the education department’s budget. For academic year 2019-20, the estimated budget approved for elementary education is Rs 1,606 crore ... Compared to this, Rs 148.6 crore allotted to private schools (towards fee) for 3,42,584 children is 9.3% of the approved elementary budget. The share of reimbursements of the total budget (elementary) is less than 10% and only 5% of the budgeted expenditure for the education sector,” the report said.

Nationally, 17 states have implemented the 25% quota in unaided schools for children from low-income households, benefiting around 41.3 lakh. Four states account for 68% of them: Madhya Pradesh has the highest number (11 lakh), followed by Rajasthan (6.7 lakh), Karnataka (6.4 lakh) and Tamil Nadu (3.9 lakh) .

According to the report, the highest amount of reimbursement per student is in Tamil Nadu (Rs 25,155- Rs 33,146), followed by Delhi (Rs 26,708- Rs 26,908) and Tripura (Rs 21,138). The lowest is in Jharkhand (Rs 5,100) and Uttar Pradesh (Rs 5,400). The per-child fee cost in Karnataka is fixed at Rs 8,000-Rs 16,000 and going by the top-end of the band, Karnataka comes seventh among states.
