But when the logistics for that did not work out, he wanted to do another project with Prajwal. Guru knew about a script that his close associate Jadesh Kumar had been working on for his directorial debut, and narrated it to the Prajwal. As it turns out, the actor was excited about the subject and came on board. “Initially, we were looking for a producer to back the film, but when Thackeray got delayed, I decided to make it as the first project under my home banner,” says Guru. The film, Gentleman, produced by G Cinemas Guru Deshpande Productions, releases today and Guru is very proud of his first as a producer. “I want films from my banner to have a novelty factor and be entertaining and Gentleman sets the tone just right. While it is film that deals with the sleeping beauty syndrome and the human egg trafficking mafia, it has the right mix of class and mass elements to make it a must-watch for all audiences,” he says.",entertainment,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73985075,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-191547/73985075.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/kannada/movies/news/gentleman-mixes-class-and-mass-elements-guru-deshpande/articleshow/73985075.cms

2,['7/02/2020'],A singer needs to be a good storyteller: Benny Dayal,"Singer Benny Dayal , who has multiple chartbusters in different languages to his credit, shares a special bond with Bengaluru. He had tied the knot with model Catherine Thangam in the city a few years ago. No wonder, then, he got a little nostalgic during his recent trip to namma ooru for the Under 25 summit. In a quick chat with us, he spoke about his absence from the Kannada music industry and his views on the country’s booming indie music scene. Excerpts:Right now, a lot of things are going on in the music sector, enabling more and more artistes to explore their talent. It’s a welcome trend. That way, audiences also have more options to choose from. Often, it’s seen that the unfamiliar and unconventional compositions stand out among these.Well, it’s not just about being a singer, but also about being a storyteller. A song’s lyrics are put together to tell a story. What matters is how you are able to convey that story, regardless of whether it’s been composed by someone else or yourself. It’s not about the tag of filmi music or indie music. What matters is whether or not people are being able to connect with your music.Sid Sriram, Arijit Singh Prateek Kuhad and Papon are some of my favourites. My ultimate idol, however, is Vishal Dadlani . He’s not only a singer, but a composer and a writer too.Saying the right thing at the right time is a skill that comes from knowledge and experience. The older you grow, the wiser you become. What I feel is that one should not be over-opinionated, and should use discretion while making a statement.To be honest, I’ve not been getting many calls for Kannada songs.My band, Funktuation, is all set to release a new single on Valentine’s Day. It’ll have a cool, cute video that shows how love can bring a freshness to life.My connection with Bengaluru dates back to my college days. I studied in Chennai, but I often used to visit this city for inter-collegiate competitions. I used to perform at small gigs too. I also have a lot of friends here. What makes Bengaluru more special for me, however, is the fact that I got married here. My wife is from America, and because her family couldn’t handle the heat in Chennai and Kerala, we decided to have the wedding here.",entertainment,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73985036,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-140129/73985036.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/kannada/music/a-singer-needs-to-be-a-good-storyteller-benny-dayal/articleshow/73985036.cms
3,['7/02/2020'],Remya Nambeesan Anjaam Pathiraa: The insecurities of actresses have come down to an extent: Remya Nambeesan,"In Anjaam Pathiraa , when Fathima, wife of Anwar Hussain appears on screen, the audience get a surprise glimpse of Remya Nambeesan . The actress’ last full-length role in Malayalam was almost five years back in 2015, though she was busy in Tamil, both as an actor and a singer. Ask her why and she doesn’t give us a specific reason, but asserts that she would love do films in her mother tongue.Remya, who was last seen in an extended cameo in Virus alongside an ensemble cast, is happy about her role in Anjaam Pathiraa, the way her career has shaped up in the Tamil film industry and how she takes forward her passion for music and dance.In a candid chat, the Chaappa Kurish actress who has been always vocal about the injustice towards women in the industry, speaks about returning to Mollywood and other subjects.It was because I became really busy in Tamil after Sethupathi. Suddenly, offers dried up in Malayalam from 2015. If you ask me to specify the reasons, I am really not sure. Was it because I asked for the remuneration that I felt I deserved? And, they thought it was a sudden rise? Luckily, I was getting very good offers from Tamil. Also, I wasn’t able to take up some projects that came to me from Malayalam as I had already given my dates to Tamil projects.I took up Virus after a long time. Till then, many people thought that I had stopped acting in Malayalam.I really loved the script and felt the technical team was very sensible. Also, each character is integral to the story, no matter how much screen space each has. I am someone who has never bothered about the length of my character in any film, but only about the importance of the role. In Traffic, I hardly have one or two scenes, but my role is pivotal for the story’s progression. When I read Anjaam Pathiraa’s script, I felt I shouldn’t miss it as none of the dialogues by the character is irrelevant. Midhun is a director who gives enough freedom to the actors and I really had a relaxed shoot. I think everyone had the same feeling and that has reflected in the performance of each actor.I have five projects in Tamil now. My next release is Thamezharasan with Vijay Antony , then Ranger with Sibiraj. I am also part of a typical fun Tamil road movie named Plan Panni Pannanum and I am also doing an offtrack movie. I am associating again with Prabhu Deva.Never. My mother tongue is Malayalam and it is in my blood. So, doing a character in our own language is a very different feeling and a unique comfort. It really feels good. However, for me acting is my job and as an actor, I grab a good opportunity wherever I get one. Cinema has now become more universal due to online platforms and people from anywhere in the world can now watch movies from any language. For me, my work and talent have to be recognised. I am doing well in Tamil and received good offers, so I stayed back. If I get good scripts in Malayalam, I will definitely come back here.(Laughs) It is a three-minute video titled Unhide which I am planning to release on February 14. I wasn’t sure if I could do but I did. It is a small theme that I had in my mind and I have just tried to visualise it.It is a part of my life. I had sung for Dabaang 3 in Tamil and for my upcoming movie which has Yuvan Shankar Raja composing music. I am doing concerts, judging reality shows and in dance, I am doing stage performances and shows.There will be definitely be opposition when we speak up about injustice. That’s quite natural. When you react or talk, people treat us, especially women, as aliens. It is not necessary that we say something intellectual. Even if we speak up about basic things, it can make people uncomfortable. I do not know why.We are now living in a world undergoing big changes, but most people here aren’t happy when we speak out. They should understand that it is the beginning of change and only through discussion, will there be transformation. I have taken it all in a sportsman spirit as, I believe, things will change eventually. When we speak out initially, there will be hatred and as we continue to do so, people will evolve. If you believe in yourself and work hard, and stay strong without being afraid of the opposition, you will definitely have your space in the industry.What I have understood is that the insecurities that prevailed in the minds of women in the industry have come down to an extent. Of late, in Malayalam, I have been working with young filmmakers and I felt really comfortable, be it on Aashiq Abu’s set or Midhun’s set. There is a very good working atmosphere. I feel things are slowly changing and we will have a comfortable working atmosphere. However, it isn't true that there are no issues in the industry. What we need is equal space and opportunity. All aspiring actresses should walk into films without any fear or apprehension. They should feel free and at peace to work in the industry.",entertainment,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73981175,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-223373/73981175.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/malayalam/movies/news/the-insecurities-of-actresses-have-come-down-to-an-extent-remya-nambeesan/articleshow/73981175.cms

INDORE: A 12-year-old child in Mandsaur, who played a British police officer in a school drama on Bhagat Singh , accidentally hanged himself at home while trying to replicate the execution of the revolutionary.

According to local police, the victim, Priyansh Malviya of Bholiya village, was found hanging in a hut on his father's farm on Sunday evening. An upturned cot lay on the floor, along with a smartphone with a video clip of the play he had acted in the previous evening. News of the accident trickled out on Thursday.

""Preliminary investigation revealed that the child had participated in a play in his school's annual event. The next day, he was watching a video clip of the drama and was trying to recreate the scene. He couldn't maintain balance, and the cot he was standing on collapsed, leaving him hanging from the rope. It was not suicide but a tragic accident,"" Mandsaur SP Hitesh Choudhary said. The postmortem report confirmed suffocation as cause of death. His body was handed over to the family for the last rites.

Priyansh's father Vinod Malviya is a government teacher. ""On his parents' wish, we had given the role of a British police officer to Priyansh in the short, three-minute-long play. We came to know about the tragic incident today,'' Gyan Sagar School principal Arun Jain said.

11,['7/02/2020'],Tollywood remembers Queen of Cabaret,"There was a time in the ’60s when Miss Shefali née Arati Das would dance the night away at the poshest nightclubs in the city. Dressed in glamorous cabaret costumes, she would sway to the beats of live music. On Thursday morning, the first Bengali cabaret dancer — popular as the Queen of Cabaret — passed away at her residence, marking the end of an era. She reigned for many years, moving up the ladder of financial stability, before the cabaret culture faded into oblivion. Her extraordinary life has inspired commercial and arthouse filmmakers alike. However, despite the fame she enjoyed in her prime, the last few years of her life were spent alone, struggling to make ends meet. We spoke to a few Tollywood celebrities who shared fond memories of the legend.Rituparna SenguptaShefalidi was a stalwart who made cabaret a popular dance form. I interacted with her several times and she always treated me with a lot of affection. It is sad that an artiste of her stature had to go through severe financial crisis in old age. I tried to help her as much as I could. She was once felicitated by my company for being a woman of power, which she truly was. There were days when she would call me up and cry while sharing her plight of not getting any work. It’s hard to believe that this is the sameperson who had acted in two of Satyajit Ray ’s films? Shefalidi used to love Bengali food and I remember gifting her a Dhakai, which she wished to have after seeing me wear one at an event. She also taught me a few dance moves. I will soon start working on a film based on her life, as it was Shefalidi’s wish to see me play her on screen.Miss Shefali worked in two of Baba’s (Satyajit Ray) films — Seemabaddha and Pratidwandi. A thorough professional, she was an easy actress to work with. Baba used to explain the scene just once and she’d do it perfectly. She was a natural in front of the camera. We all know she was a great cabaret dancer. So, Baba put a spotlight on her talent in Seemabaddha.Arati Das, better known as Miss Shefali, is more than a cabaret dancer to us. I’d love to remember her as a veteran dancer who made cabaret so famous. For me, she’ll always be Shefali aunty, as she was my mother’s friend and also close to rest of the family. I’ve accompanied Ma to Shefali aunty’s Park Circus house several times. She used to help girls from villages realise their dreams of becoming cabaret dancers. I have seen her live performances and the way she used to maintain her dignity and poise is really praiseworthy. It is sad that our Sandhya Raater Shefali had to suffer financial crisis and lead a lonely life in the last few years. But our Queen of Cabaret will forever be a part of Kolkata’s history.When I was offered Miss Rupali’s character in Bhobishyoter Bhoot, inspired by Miss Shefali’s life, I was both nervous and excited. Shefali had an aura about herself. She started from scratch and reached the pinnacle of fame, mesmerising everyone with her dance moves. But she went into a cocoon and suffered. It was challenging to play a character like that. It is sad that someone, as popular as her, died in penury.Miss Shefali had a dance number in one of Ma’s (Suchitra Sen) films. Once the shoot was over, she came up to Ma to get a picture clicked with her. But before that, she wrapped a shawl around herself as she was not comfortable in her cabaret costume. Also, this was her way of showing respect to Ma. I remember going to a night club with Ma’s friend, where I saw her perform live. She was graceful in her moves. Years later, I met her during a show in North Bengal. She was not well. I helped her with the makeup. Once she was in her costume, she set the stage on fire. I heard the last few years of her life were quite depressing. The Queen of Cabaret will always be alive in our hearts.The news of Shefali’s demise has caused me a lot of grief. I knew her personally, she was full of life and laughter. The very thought that someone as successful as her in the world of cabaret had to lead such a lonely life — devoid of work and financial stability — makes me very sad. I did whatever little I could for Shefali, but she deserved much more as an artiste.Shefali and I shared the stage a couple of times. It was for a play, Porostree, where she had a dance performance. She was also part of many popular plays, like Samrat o Sundari, Saheb Bibi Golam , Ashlil to name a few. Once we went to Kokrajhar in Assam for a show, where we bonded really well. She was an extremely good soul. I met her at an event few months ago. She was crying and looking for work. It’s sad that Shefali, who was a cabaret sensation in ’60s and ’70s had to suffer so much!",entertainment,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73984550,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-3938232/73984550.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/bengali/movies/news/tollywood-remembers-queen-of-cabaret/articleshow/73984550.cms

Jab yeh thoda hawa bhare tab iska wazan badhega.” He added, “Despite the fact that he is such a big star, he doesn’t let it dominate the other person. In order to make the other person feel at ease Salman bhai will start a random conversation about the person’s family and general stuff. He ensures that the other person feels like they’re talking to the character in the film and not Salman Khan the superstar.”— Yashi Agarwal",lucknow,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73985006,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-269524,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/salman-bhai-is-a-great-human-being-ishtiyak-khan/articleshow/73985032.cms
14,['7/02/2020'],Restaurant Review: Play The Lounge,"It was 11 pm. Dining alone was kickstarting my adrenaline. The music was loud, the lighting was soft and the restaurant was packed, as was the dance floor. I was happy to get back to my old practice of dining alone. I’d done it for several years while writing one of the world’s first vegetarian guides to Paris, and also for Pune’s Food Guide and Mumbai’s Nightlife Guide. There’s a certain joy in dining alone. It also keeps one focussed and razor-sharp alert on the food, service and ambiance without any distractions from chatting with one’s dining companions. In that crowded, hammered by loud music, darkness enrobed space, could the food really be up to anything much? Was ‘Play’ going to only live up to its name? At 1 am, an enjoyable two hours later, I got the answer.Chilled air-conditioning and a lively young vibe here. Play The Lounge, opened in July last year, on the first floor of The Orb in Andheri. It sprawls into two rooms — the glassed-in sheesha room as well as the dining area decked around the dance floor.The menu whizzes around the globe. The very first surprise was the mushroom baklava. Neat little crisp pastry pockets hold a mushy, tasty mushroom pate. A tasty Burmese khowsuey with a balanced creamy coconut-infused curry perked up with crunchy condiments and sparkled with lemon juice. The robustly spiced paneer meal was served in the “housefull” bento box complete with fragrant rice, spicy mint chutney. Chef Ranjit Nath (formerly of 212) ensures that even the John Dory was cooked just right and tiramisu had just the right sweetness. Attentive service helmed by Ishwar Pradhan. Plenty of innovative drinks, too.Dining in the dark to the sound of loud music is not my idea of a great meal. The overcooked, rubbery Angare Chicken Tikka and the hard biscuity base of the pizza disappointed, as did the chalky blueberry cheesecake.Happy surprises here. In what appears to be a noisy, dance-play (gaming zone et al) booze-centric space, food does play a prominent role. Sure, they have many a hook for everything else — on Monday, alcohol is served at MRP prices and there are exciting drinking games, too. But, the strange-sounding hotch-potch of a menu was tasty and worth trying. Play offers more than just play, for there is playful food served through the day as well.Play The LoungeThe Orb, Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj International Airport, IA Project Road, Andheri (E)Timings: 12 pm to 1.30 amContact: 089065 58888Meal for two: Rs.2,500Rating:Food: 3.5Service: 3.5Décor: 3.5",life-style,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73993489,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-99369/73993489.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//life-style/food-news/restaurant-review-play-the-lounge/articleshow/73993266.cms

Varanasi is and will always remain a very special place for me as I was born and brought up there. I value the place more now, ever since I moved to Los Angeles and am living in a different part of the world.There is a certain pull towards the place despite its small town existence. The simplicity of the place starts to encroach upon you. Banaras is one of the very few places in the world that has a very different charm. Apart from its religious significance, it is the people of Banaras that makes it really special, they are really warm. The city has a Ganga Jamuni tehzeeb which the people still believe in. The place still holds on to things which are gradually becoming unique. It still has its simplicity, minimalistic way of life, while the world is becoming complex.” Amit, who recently connected with Hollywood actor Gerard Butler, says,”These are the small things which makes Banaras special and even the West is recognising this. These are very profound messages the city gives and those who have gone through various cycles of life understand this. The extensions like the Ganga aarti, etc add to the value of Banaras. Recently actor Gerard Butler was in Banaras and a common friend of ours connected me to him. She told me that Gerard loves Banaras and also conveyed to him that I hail from the city. Though we could not meet as we were there on different dates but Gerard messaged me that he was heartbroken on leaving Banaras as he loves the place so much.”Almost a veteran on television Amit says the medium has very steadily moved to web or OTT platform, which is an extension of television. The approach and functioning of OTT platform is same as television but for a better quality and in a very finite way. The choice to the target audience is given keeping the quality in mind. Television has in a way migrated to the OTT platform. Most of the content providers for this platform are from the television industry , though other people are also coming, because the fundamentals are the same. Even TV producers get to explore more here, as there are certain restriction on networks, like there are certain things you cannot show on TV and the target audience have to be met. But OTT platform gives the producers to really explore themselves, to show the content in the real self as is should be, not with conditions,” he says.Amit Sarin (inset) with Vineesha Arora Sarin at Assi Ghat (BCCL/ Arvind Kumar)Apart from moving to the web platform, television, as a medium has changed, believes the actor. “At the time I did shows like Kyunki, Kkusum, Pavitra Rishtra, there was no alternative. Either there were films or television. Obviously the viewership for television show was huge, the tenure of shows spanned across six –seven years, so the relationship you shared with your audience was very long. Recently at Vegas, a couple came up to me and addressed me by the name of the character which I played in one of the television shows. The connect with those on- screen characters is still strong. The characters were very popular then. Today the tenure of the television show is very short, barring few that have a very long life. Also people have moved to different kind of shows like sports channel have evolved, there are life style channels , so there is much more variety for people now. Earlier this was not the case. In those times, if your mother, sister or your wife had to see their daily soaps you had no other choice, either to join them or to entertain yourself. Now there are many options of entertainment so television has limited its reach,” he says.Amrit Sarin, who has moved to LA, did feel restricted as an actor, becoming one of the reasons to shift base. “I feel every actor goes through that cycle. Yes, I did shows in which I mostly played the boy-next-door, the lover boy, the guy who sacrifices his love. Later on to explore more, I did some negative roles also, honestly I never liked it as my father would feel bad about it as he could not see me in negative roles. Every actor wants to explore more but television as a platform is not ready for it. It still needs to do what the general demand is. Producers still need to make shows what the audience want but cannot make the way the actor wants it to be. Like any other actor I also went through that cycle. You reach a point when you want to explore something else. I also had this rather disruptive attitude towards my career, I mean, I always wanted to break that comfort zone. I was never ever happy with ke paise aa rahe hain and doing shows after shows for this. That was never the kick for me, I wanted to break my boundaries. This came with its share of apprehensions. At times it scares you, you feel oh God what you are doing and also have a feeling that whether it will work or not. But now when I look back, I feel humbled that God has always helped me in everything new I tried. I guess, this is how you grow.” Life has completely changed for the actor on shifting to LA. “Moving was a huge cultural shift for me as I have lived all my life in India. I have built my career bit by bit in Mumbai. It took me 20 years, without a Godfather to establish myself as an actor. I really struggled for seven years to get my first show Kkusum that gave me recognition. All of a sudden I left everything and now I am in LA, it’s a different set of people. It is more of a system driven country contrary to India which is people driven. In India we take each other’s help, we talk to each other. In US the system is in place for everyone, which has to be followed by everyone. There you don’t depend on people to get things done. This is a huge change,” he says.The actor who is both in production and acting says, “Acting is my first love but right now I am producing and acting both. To set up my production house along with my wife Vineesha, was not an easy task. At the moment we are working on a feature film and a finite series for OTT platform. Doing both these things, to set up everything up in the Mecca of entertainment, which is LA, needed gigantic efforts. I am happy we are doing well.

17,['7/02/2020'],More than 25 films registered with words ‘Section’ & ‘Article’ in titles,"'Section' and 'Article' seem to be the new favourite words in film titles as producers are making a beeline at the production association offices to register the titles of their films. Last year, after the central government revoked Article 370 (which granted Jammu and Kashmir special status), the associations received multiple applications for titles with Article 370 as well as Article 35 A, and Dhara 370 in them. An official of Indian Film and TV Producers Council (IFTPC) says, ""Those titles which are registered with us are Section 364, Section 376, Section 302, Section 420, Section 484, Section 424, Article 14, Article 370, Article 35A, Dhara 370.""An official of the Indian Motion Picture Producers' Association (IMPPA), says, ""IMPPA has received around 20 applications for the title of films which include the words 'Article', 'Dhara', 'Section' in them. As the films Article 15 and Section 375 created quite a buzz, many producers are also interested in having these words in the titles. A committee will look into the plot and other aspects of the films and then decide who should be granted the titles.""A source from the Indian Film & Television Directors' Association (IFTDA), says, ""We've registered 15 titles with 'Section' and 'Article' in them for feature films. We also have several other applications for titles including Citizenship (Amendment) Act in them."" Gautam Chintamani , a film historian says, ""It's not surprising that filmmakers are making a beeline for these titles because filmmakers and audience both find movies with such titles intriguing. Also, titles with 'Section' or 'Article' are good for social media campaigns – in forming hashtags and get the film trending, making it topical. Article 15 should get the credit of coming up with the title first.""While film experts now praise the film Article 15 for its title, director Anubhav Sinha says that his judgment was questioned when people from the film industry first heard about the title of his film. Speaking at a session in Delhi, he said, ""When I named my film Article 15, people in the industry were wondering, 'What kind of a name is this for a film?' But that film did more business than many big budget movies and what's more important is that the title Article 15 struck an emotional chord with the audience.""Ajay Bahl, director of the film Section 375, adds, ""When Manish Gupta wrote the film, he titled it Section 375 because that was the story (based on Section 375 of Indian Penal Code ) , and it made perfect sense. But honestly, I thought that we should use another title instead. But we couldn’t come up with anything better than this for this film, so we kept it. And it worked.""Pointing out how Bollywood has the habit of following trends, Gautam Chintamani, says, ""Knowing the Bombay film industry, it's likely that producers will tell the writers to just go through the Constitution and see on which Article/Section a film's title can be based!""There are several film producers' associations and to avoid duplication of titles, all these associations cross-check with each other before registering the film titles.",entertainment,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73985017,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-146335/73985017.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/hindi/bollywood/news/more-than-25-films-registered-with-words-section-article-in-titles/articleshow/73985050.cms

21,['7/02/2020'],Want to know the connection between Mumbai’s water fountain and Napoleon?,"Mumbai city is a veritable treasure house of history, especially South Mumbai with its buildings and monuments that are architectural proofs to the time gone by. Numerous heritage walks are conducted at this place as it’s an open air museum for history buffs, photographers and artists. One such walk, being conducted as part of The Kala Ghoda Arts Festival, in association with The Times Of India, has a group of Mumbaikars wanting to change the general belief that history is only about iconic structures. Passionate about the city, they want city dwellers and tourists to reacquaint themselves with the City That Never Sleeps, create an awareness about its history and heritage and archive and conserve it. Dr Preeti Kelkar and Dr Mirgank Warrier, who conducted the Wodehouse Walk, had their group gawking and gasping in surprise as they names-dropped names as varied as the French autocrat Napoleon Bonaparte to Indian cinema’s first shero, Fearless Nadia in connection with this city. ""I’ve passed these structures so many times but never knew the history behind it. This walk gives you a perspective and you get to know the importance of these structures and how they came to be,"" said Puneet, an art and history lover, who participated in the walk.Built in 1865, the Wellington Fountain in South Bombay is nearly 155 years-old. But did you know that it was the defeat of the French emperor Napoleon Bonaparte in the Battle of Waterloo in 1815 that led to the construction of the fountain? Dr Preeti shares, “Napoleon Bonaparte was admired as a great military leader as he never lost a battle, except the battle of Waterloo. This was a historical moment for the British as he was defeated by the Duke of Wellington, Arthur Wellesley. They built Wellington Fountain to honour him.”They say history is written by the victor, however, it’s also subject to people’s interpretations, and a lot of it is also lost in translation. To understand Mumbai, which was known as Bombay then, you need to go back to how the city has evolved. Dr Preeti explains, “Initially, the East India Company came looking at earning revenue and encouraged traders from all over to settle here in exchange for that. They also promised religious tolerance.” Dr Mirgank adds that since Hindus were afraid to lose their caste by crossing the sea, they chose to live in places like Girgaum, while Muslims settled in places like Dongri. You can also get a glimpse of Mumbai in the 1700s at an ongoing exhibit, showcasing paintings by James Wales juxtaposed against photographs taken in the same locations now.1. The Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Vastu Sangrahalaya, formerly known as the Prince of Wales Museum, functioned as a temporary hospital during the First World War to nurse British and Indian troops.2. Schoen House was once a home to Mary Ann Evans and her husband, filmmaker Homi Wadia.

SRINAGAR: In a clear demonstration of its tough intent, the Union Territory administration on Thursday invoked the Public Safety Act ( PSA ) to extend the detention of former CMs Omar Abdullah and Mehbooba Mufti along with NC general secretary Ali Muhammad Sagar and senior PDP functionary Sartaj Madani.The move came amid strong demands from the opposition for the freeing of the former CMs. Highly placed sources said Srinagar deputy commissioner and district magistrate Shahid Iqbal Chowdhary signed the police dossiers on Omar and Mehbooba as part of the procedure to detain them for another three months under the PSA. In August, the same law had been invoked to put Omar’s father Farooq Abdullah , also a former CM, un der house arrest in his private Gupkar Road residence.The decision to detain Omar and Mehbooba under the PSA “to prevent breach of peace” was taken at a meeting between the police brass and chief secretary BVR Subrahmanyam. It means that all three former CMs of J&K are now detained under PSA.Both Omar and Mehbooba have been in detention since August 5, when the Centre tabled a bill in Parliament to nullify Articles 370 and 35A of the Constitution and revoke J&K’s special status. In the months since, several foreign governments have urged the Centre to release all political prisoners.Omar and Mehbooba had earlier been detained under Section 107 of the CrPC. Following completion of six months’ detention, continuing to hold them under the same law would have become untenable, though they could have been detained again after going through the motions of “releasing” them.Instead, authorities decided to invoke the PSA. Earlier in the day, Sagar and Madani, who is Mehbooba’s maternal uncle, were moved from the MLA Hostel here to a guesthouse that has been converted into a sub-jail. Madani’s detention under the PSA was approved by the district magistrate of Kulgam on the basis of a police dossier stating that “he played a vital role in mobilising anti-social elements in the Valley” in the aftermath of the 2009 Asiya and Neelofar rape-murder case in Shopian.The dossier also accuses him of “provoking people to come onto the streets and actively support separatists, and propagate secession of J&K from the Union of India, especially after Afzal Guru’s hanging”. In Sagar’s case, the dossier submitted by the police to the district magistrate of Srinagar states that “he was very vocal” against the nullification of Articles 370 and 35A and had “instigated” people to protest against it.“His capacity to disturb public order can be gauged from the fact that he succeeded in mobilising voters in the peak of militancy for poll boycotts,” the dossier reads. Bashir Ahmad Veeri, another NC leader and former MLC in detention for over six months, was on Thursday taken from the MLA Hostel to his official residence in Srinagar’s Jawahar Nagar and put under house arrest.In the past 24 hours, he is the third political functionary to be moved from preventive detention to house arrest.",india,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73994691,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-147595,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/after-6-months-detention-omar-abdullah-mehbooba-mufti-booked-under-psa/articleshow/73994666.cms

NEW DELHI: Google Maps is completing its 15th anniversary and the tech giant is marking the occasion with a brand new look for its landmark navigation app and key product updates to enhance user experience.

""Starting today, you'll see an updated Google Maps app for Android and iOS that gives you everything you need at your fingertips with five easy-to-access tabs: Explore, Commute, Saved, Contribute and Updates,"" Vice President (Product) of Google Maps Dane Glasgow said in a statement.

The redesigned look will have a ""Contribute"" tab at the bottom that will allow users to share local knowledge, such as details about roads and addresses, missing places, business reviews and photos, the search giant said.

The ""commute"" tab on the app will be tuned further to user needs to help them get from point A to point B more efficiently, the company said.

A new ""updates"" tab will showcase ""must-see"" spots that are recommended by local experts and publishers aside from letting users chat with businesses to get answers to questions.

Google said it has also added new transit features in the app to help users plan their travel better. For instance, public transport commuters can now access details such as the temperature inside a bus or train, accommodation for people with disabilities, designated areas for women and whether there is security on board.

Talking about the India-specific features, senior vice-president of Google Maps Jen Fitzpatrick told reporters that they have introduced several updates that were directly inspired by markets like India.

She said that India has contributed significantly when it comes to the improvement of Google Maps by offering inspiration to numerous innovations.

For instance, the public transport tab on Google Maps for Android now informs users about a journey that combines auto-rickshaw and public transport and indicates how much time it will take, and which station they should take an auto-rickshaw to/from.

The feature, which is currently available in Delhi and Bengaluru, will soon be rolled out in several other cities.

Glasgow said the company plans to roll out the new features globally starting March.

He said the new Google Maps icon will reflect the evolution it has made by mapping the world.

Once solid-red ""pins"" pointing out map locations is now made up of the four colors used in other Google logos.

PTI photo

NEW DELHI: Chabahar port and more air corridors could overcome the problem of direct connectivity between India and the five central Asian countries, foreign minister S Jaishankar said on Thursday.

Launching the India Central Asia business council, Jaishankar said India would host the second India Central Asia Dialogue this year, which would include Afghanistan along with five central Asian countries. Emphasising their importance, Jaishankar said, “As developing countries, we share common perspectives and... we also work together to meet common challenges such as terrorism, extremism, radicalisation, drug trafficking etc. which affect our region.”

As Afghanistan moves to wards a peace process with the Taliban and an uncertain future post the US drawdown, India reckons that its synergies in the security sphere with these states would be that much more.

“Clearly, a great potential exists in enhancing trade and economic engagement between India and central Asia. There is the challenge of lack of efficient overland connectivity. India proposes to overcome this challenge through the Chabahar route.” The Centre’s budget allocated an additional Rs 100 crore to develop the port.

“We had discussed with Mr Javad Zarif (Iranian foreign minister) how to make the Chabahar port commercially more attractive. I think both sides will take some additional measures to make the port more relevant to the current traffic... This is part of our larger commitment to the International North South Transport Corridor and the Ashgabat Agreement . The combination of all these factors could be a partial game changer for our trade with central Asia.”

The minister said “we should also examine the viability of establishing air corridors between India and the central Asian states”. “Availability of air corridors can boost trade in perishable goods, agricultural and food product.”

MUMBAI: Loans for housing, auto and small businesses are likely to get cheaper even without the Reserve Bank of India's (RBI's) monetary policy committee reducing interest rates.RBI governor Shatikanta Das on Thursday took some unconventional steps to bring down borrowing costs.In his last monetary policy for the current financial year, Das said RBI would provide cheap long-term financing to banks for up to Rs 1 lakh crore through long-term (one-year to three-year) repos. He also said cash reserve requirements would be waived on deposits that are used to provide retail loans between January 21, 2020 and July 31, 2020. This will make housing, auto and SME loans cheaper as 4% of deposits impounded in cash reserves will be freed.The third measure announced to bring down cost of loans was benchmarking loans to medium-sized enterprises to RBI's repo rate (the rate at which RBI lends to banks). The measures were received positively by the markets, with shares of banks, housing finance and real estate companies rallying sharply.The rupee and bond markets also registered gains.SBI chairman Rajnish Kumar said while the decision to hold policy rates was universally anticipated, the bouquet of developmental and regulatory steps was a positive surprise to the financial ecosystem. Bankers said the measures were clearly aimed at bringing down the cost of borrowing even though the six-member MPC voted to retain RBI's repo rate at a 10-year low of 5.15%.In Video: Repo rate remains unchanged at 5.15%: RBI",business,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73995340,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-132518,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/new-retail-loans-set-to-get-cheaper-as-rbi-tweaks-crr/articleshow/73995338.cms

GUWAHATI: On the eve of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's visit to Assam , Ulfa (Independent) chief Paresh Baruah said on Thursday that he was ready to hold peace talks with the Centre if the PM agreed to discuss his organisation's demand for ""sovereignty"".

The state government, as announced earlier by finance minister Himanta Biswa Sarma , is expected to raise the Ulfa (I) issue with Modi on Friday in Kokrajhar where the PM will be attending a thanksgiving rally organised by the Bodos to commemorate the signing of the Bodo accord last month.

Earthern lamps lining the streets and in front of homes have lit up Kokrajhar, about 220 km from Guwahati, to welcome Modi. The PM will arrive at Kokrajhar by noon on Friday. It will be his first visit to Assam after the anti-CAA protests exploded in the state.

Modi tweeted, ""Tomorrow, I look forward to being in Assam. I will be in Kokrajhar to address a public meeting. We will mark the successful signing of the Bodo Accord, which brings to an end a problem that had been persisting for decades. It marks the start of a new era of peace and progress.""

The Assam government has declared a public holiday in the Bodo autonomous area on Friday to enable people to hear Modi.

Northeast Frontier Railway is running four special trains from different locations to Kokrajhar ferrying participants. Talking to TOI from an undisclosed location, Baruah the militant leader said, ""Assam minister Himanta Biswa Sarma recently told the media that the government of India will examine if a democratically elected government can sit for discussions on the issue of sovereignty and he has been courteous enough.

Baruah, 63, who is believed to be holed up in China now, told TOI, ""If Modi is determined, all we need from him is a written assurance that only sovereignty will be discussed and we will come for talks. We will hold the discussions in Assam, and not on foreign soil. The PM should think about India's and Assam's good.""

27,['7/02/2020'],"Right to internet not fundamental, services can be cut, says govt","This story is from February 7, 2020

File photo

NEW DELHI: Union law and communication minister Ravi Shankar Prasad justified snapping of internet services for maintaining law and order and national security on Thursday, while saying that the right to internet is not fundamental. He said the right to expression is subject to reasonable restrictions as provided in the Constitution.

Responding to a question whether internet is a fundamental right based on a recent Supreme Court observation, Prasad said there is a misconception that needs to be cleared. He said that the decision to stop internet services is taken by the local authorities taking into consideration the law and order situation.

Though he did not specify how many times such measures have been taken, sources said there were over 700 such instances since 2017. Only in one case, Centre had stopped internet services in Delhi as the Centre is responsible for law and order in the UT.

Sources said internet services were snapped across several states including Maharashtra , West Bengal , Gujarat, Punjab, north-eastern states, the erstwhile state of J&K, and Uttar Pradesh.

During the Question Hour in Rajya Sabha, Prasad said that communication of ideas and opinions through the internet is part of the fundamental right to speech and expressions. ""The SC has stated that no lawyer argued that right to the internet is a fundamental right. What the top court has commented is that for communication of your ideas and opinions, the use of the internet will also be holding a part of your fundamental right of speech and expression,"" Prasad said. He said no one can deny the abuse of the internet for spreading violence and terrorism, and Pakistan has been doing it in Kashmir .

""Once the SC has announced that the use of the internet to propagate one's opinion and ideas will be held to be fundamental rights and I will like to flag...this will also be subject to reasonable restrictions...for public order, security and integrity of India,"" he added.

28,['7/02/2020'],"Narendra Modi: A few hours earlier, PM Modi had slammed ‘unacceptable’ remarks by J&amp;K ex-CMs","PTI photo

NEW DELHI: “There have been statements made by former Jammu & Kashmir chief ministers that are not acceptable to us and should bother anyone raising issues relating to the Constitution,” Prime Minister Narendra Modi said in Parliament on Thursday while replying to the debate on the motion of thanks to the President’s address.Hours before former CMs Mehbooba Mufti and Omar Abdullah were booked under the Public Safety Act at the end of their six-month detention, Modi quoted Mufti as having said, “Humne jis desh ke saath rahne ka faisla kiya, us ne dhokha kiya hai... aisa lagta hai humne 1947 mein galat chunav kiya tha (The country with which we decided to stay has betrayed us, it seems we made a wrong choice in 1947).”He then added, “How can someone endorse such a statement... has the Constitution deceived her?” He criticised the former CMs for remarks on scrapping the state’s special status.Asserting that Kashmir was the “crown jewel” of India, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said, “My government has pushed development in Jammu & Kashmir. We had faith in the people of the Valley but the leaders in the state didn’t have.”Modi said Kashmir’s identity was buried on January 19, 1990 when Kashmiri Pandits started leaving the Valley due to militancy. He said Ladakh would be developed as a carbon-neutral Union territory. Modi also said those opposing the Citizenship (Amendment) Act that seeks to provide Indian citizenship to minorities from Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh were hand in glove with the “tukde-tukde” gang.“What Pakistan has been trying for decades, a hypothetical fear is being created by Congress... Those opposing the law are seen being clicked with the tukde-tukde gang,” the PM said. In lengthy interventions in the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha, the PM countered the charge that the government is “dividing” the country with CAA, quoting Jawaharlal Nehru and Lal Bahadur Shastri to argue that a special dispensation for nonMuslims from Pakistan was acknowledged by the Congress icons.“Was Nehru communal? Did he discriminate between Hindus and Muslims? Did he want a Hindu rashtra?” he asked. Modi said Congress’s opposition to the CAA was opportunistic and driven by “vote-bank politics”. He asked Congress if its members could be labelled “communal” for voicing concern over problems faced by minorities in Pakistan. “Why did Nehru not include all citizens but mention only religious minorities in the Nehru-Liaquat agreement,” Modi asked, and said his government was doing what India’s first PM had said decades ago.He asserted that several reports, including those of parliamentary panels, had recommended a law like the CAA. He, however, was critical of Nehru when he said, “There is nothing wrong in having the ambition to be Prime Minister. But there was a time when because of one person’s ambition to be PM, a line was drawn that caused the Partition of India.”The PM said Congress would always choose votebank politics to development and asked if it was unable to relate to the pain suffered by persecuted minorities in the neighbourhood. He recalled Kerala CM Pinarayi Vijayan’s remark that extremist elements may have infiltrated anti-CAA protests. Modi said if the government had followed its predecessor’s footsteps, it would never have been able to undo Article 370, pass the Enemy Property Act and bring CAA. In a strong defence of CAA and the National Population Register, he referred to Nehru’s letter to Assam’s first CM, Gopinath Bordoloi, asking him to distinguish between Hindu refugees and Muslim migrants from Pakistan.Modi said Nehru noted that if required, the law should be amended to grant citizenship to the refugees. In the Rajya Sabha, Modi said NPR was being updated to allow rightful beneficiaries the benefit of government welfare schemes. He said NPR was first done in 2010 and updated in 2015.“Don’t try to mislead people,” he said, asking opposition parties to not “politicise the issue”. “They are opposing (NPR) for narrow and frivolous political narrative. This is antipoor,” he said, adding his government had made productive use of data collected by the previous NPR to deliver benefits to the poor. While talking of the CAA, Modi cited the examples of Bhupendra Kumar Dutta and Jogendra Nath Mandal, two freedom fighters who stayed back in Pakistan after Partition but came to India in the face of the persecution of minorities.“Both Dutta and Mandal came to India and died here,” he said and added, “Mandal was the first law minister of Pakistan and he too flagged systematic ethnic targeting of religious minorities in Pakistan.” The PM said in his youth, he had touched the feet of Khan Abdul Ghaffar Khan (popularly called Frontier Gandhi) and named other greats such as Ashfaqullah Khan, Begum Hazrat Mahal and A P J Abdul Kalam to assert that they were all Indians. Referring to the continuing protests, Modi warned street agitations against decisions of Parliament and state assemblies may lead to “anarchy” and should worry everyone.He pointedly reiterated that the CAA does not affect any Indian citizen and poses no harm to minorities. “What would happen if the decisions of the Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh assembly were opposed?” he asked. On NPR questions which have generated a controversy, Modi said this was more a governance and administrative issue and there was no sinister agenda behind it. “Since there is a lot of migration happening these days, it’s important for the government to be more aware,” he said.The PM quoted socialist leader R M Lohia pledging support for minority communities in the neighbourhood and also recalled a late 1947 Congress Working Committee proposal calling for protection of “non-Muslims” in Pakistan. Modi also mentioned Bhimrao Ambedkar’s call to the Dalit community to come to India from Pakistan.",india,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73995421,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-150731,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/a-few-hours-earlier-pm-had-slammed-unacceptable-remarks-by-jk-ex-cms/articleshow/73995422.cms

Dewan Housing Finance Ltd's chairman Kapil Wadhawan (File photo)

NEW DELHI: In its money laundering probe against Dewan Housing Finance Ltd's chairman Kapil Wadhawan, currently in Enforcement Directorate's (ED's) custody, the agency has unearthed a 12,000 sqm land in Melbourne, Australia, and some other properties allegedly purchased by Wadhawan for Rs 1,000 crore, sources said.

The ED's money trail in the case has unearthed several properties acquired by Wadhawan across the globe, allegedly laundering funds from DHFL. Among assets unearthed so far, the agency has found two flats of the DHFL chairman in New York, a flat and an office space in London, a villa in Koh Samui in Thailand, Hotel Radisson Blu in Pune, Hotel Country Inn in Mysore, four flats in Khar's DB Breeze and a flat in Mumbai's Sea View Palace, another flat in Juhu, a bungalow in Mahabaleshwar, a housing society with 570 flats in Kurla, besides others.

The agency sources said all these properties have been linked to Wadhawan and many of them were acquired using laundered funds from DHFL.

Agency sources said Wadhawan is also being questioned about his high-value transactions with Yes Bank and IndiaBulls from where he had availed huge credits. The accused, booked under Prevention of Money Laundering Act, is also being questioned for his association with one middleman, Sudhakar Setty, with whom he had transactions worth over Rs 2,000 crore, sources said.

Wadhawan was arrested last month by ED officials as the agency claimed he refused to cooperate in its ongoing investigation against dead gangster Iqbal Mirchi. Wadhawan's company Sunblink is allegedly involved in purchasing Mirchi's Mumbai properties and transferring funds to the gangster's associates. The probe is on for which he has been remanded to ED custody by a PMLA court till Friday.

Sources said, the ED probe and money trail in the case has unearthed association of several high-profile Maharashtra politicians with Pakistan-based Dawood Ibrahim.

SECUNDERABAD: The orders issued by the Ministry of Defence (MoD) over the extension of the term of the existing Secunderabad Cantonment Board (SCB) elected body by another six months has triggered a row among residents of the cantonment areas here.

The orders evoked mixed response from the residents, who have urged the MoD to conduct the SCB elections as per schedule.

“As the tenure of the elected ward members has been extended, they may indulge in corruption, as several development works are pending due to inadequate funds. Now, the board members will mount pressure on the board to obtain clearances for the works so that they get commission,” BK Bhaskar, a resident of Bowenpally, told TOI.

Another resident, V Lakshman Rao of Trimulgherry, said, “The MoD must issue poll notification for the conduct of free and fair elections and development of cantonment areas. In fact, the SCB was recently in the news for ranking among the worst cantonments in the country in terms of sanitation. If new members are elected soon, it may usher in some change.”

Moreover, the extension of the SCB’s tenure is not new to voters. “The Centre did the same previously too. The voters and those deciding to contest the election were mentally prepared for the poll. Rules must be amended so that elections are held as per schedule,” said M Ganapathy Reddy, a retired bank employee.

Meanwhile, a few elected ward members said that the move was upsetting as they had already begun campaigning in their respective civilian wards in anticipation that the MoD will issue the election notification.

“We have no other option but to wait for another six months. There is no guarantee that the MoD will issue election notification even after six months,” said a ward member who began preparations for the poll six months ago. However, another ward member said that the decision gives them more time to get pending proposals cleared and win the elections.

PATNA: Group D employees of Patna Municipal Corporation ( PMC ), mainly sanitation workers , continued their strike for the fourth day on Thursday.

With garbage and carcass of animals lying on the roads, the city virtually turned into a dumping yard. Thousands of sanitation workers remained off duty and sat on dharna at PMC headquarters at Maurya Lok here.

Police personnel were deployed at Maurya Lok for the first time since the strike started on Monday. An FIR was also lodged against six union leaders and workers at Kotwali police station on Tuesday for creating hindrance in carrying out government’s work, inciting the workers and hanging the carcass of an animal outside PMC office at Maurya Lok.

People against on whom FIR was lodged included Patna Nagar Nigam Staff union president Chandra Prakash, PMC fourth grade union general secretary Nand Kishor Das, Rairatan Prasad, Neeraj Kumar, Arjun Prasad and Satish Mishra.

The agitating sanitation workers did not call off their strike even after their representatives had a meeting with urban development and housing department (UDHD) minister Suresh Kumar Sharma and senior officials of the department on Thursday.

Even though Patna Nagar Nigam Staff union president Chandra Prakash said their meeting with the minister and officials was positive, he denied calling off the strike. “UDHD officials said the department is bound to adhere to the order of Lokyukta and cannot accept our demand of continuing the service of daily wage workers. Hence, we will continue our strike and move Patna high court on Friday,” Prakash added.

Incidentally, the UDHD has asked all urban local bodies (ULBs) to outsource the service of Group D workers and end the services of daily wage sanitation workers of PMC from March 31.

Councillor of ward number 69 Vikas Kumar alias Vicky Maurya, who is also a member of empowered standing committee of PMC, said, “The meeting with UDHD minister and officials was not much fruitful as the department is not taking this matter seriously. Being a public representative, we are facing the wrath of residents as well as the sanitation workers. If the government fails to intervene immediately, diseases might spread in the city.”

UDHD secretary Anand Kishor said the agitating workers were assured that their important demands would be fulfilled soon. “District magistrates have been asked to ensure removal of garbage on a war footing and take help of workers of private agencies,” Kishor added.

“Garbage removal work has started in many localities of Patna and the results will be visible from Friday. Of around 30 ULBs where sanitation workers are on strike, work has resumed in 14,” Kishor said.

Currently, around 2,200 sanitation workers are employed with the PMC through outsourcing. Around 4,300 are daily-wage sanitation workers and 1,100 are permanent group D employees.

Many sanitation workers of outsourcing agencies have also extended moral support to the strike, citing exploitation by the private companies and delay in their payment.

One such worker of a private outsourcing agency, said, “Our condition is even worse than permanent daily-wage workers of PMC. They are at least paid every month. We have not got a penny from our agency for past five months. Being a graduate, I get Rs 9,150 and the agency claims that it deducts some amount as my provident fund (PF). However there is no proof of PF as I never got any salary slip. Hence, we do not want others to face this situation.”

33,['7/02/2020'],Cognizant’s 4.2% growth in Q4 beats expectations,"(File photo)

CHENNAI: Cognizant ’s revenue in constant currency increased by 4.2% year-on-year in the quarter ended December. This was better than investor and analyst expectations, leading to an 8% surge in its share price in morning trade on the Nasdaq.The company, which for years was the fastest growing among the India-heritage IT services companies, slowed sharply in the past two years. The performance in the latest quarter was significantly weaker than those of HCL, Infosys and TCS. But the growth is being viewed as the likely beginning of a turnaround.New CEO Brian Humphries has been taking steps to re-energise the company, putting sharper focus on growing markets beyond the US, on new digital technologies, on restructuring the workforce to cater to these emerging requirements, and on providing sales staff with greater incentives.“Our steady progress against key initiatives is increasingly evident in our commercial and financial performance,” said Humphries. “We enter 2020 with renewed vigour and optimism.”Cognizant said it expected current-quarter revenue to grow at 2.8% to 3.8% in constant currency, and the full-year 2020 revenue to be between 2% and 4% in constant currency (the company follows a January-December financial calendar). The full-year forecast includes the estimate of a negative 110 bps impact from the exit of certain content services business, which the company announced in October. A like-for-like comparison will imply higher growth rates.While revenue in Q4 was up at $4.3 billion, net income dropped 40% to $395 million, from $648 million in the year-ago quarter, because of restructuring costs, including severance charges related to those being asked to leave the company.

BJP state chief Swatantra Dev Singh coming out of Kaal Bhairo temple on Thursday morning

VARANASI: Bharatiya Janata Party state chief Swatantra Dev Singh targeted the Opposition parties for questioning the timing of announcement of trust formation for constructing temple at Ramjanmabhoomi in Ayodhya and said that the announcement has no connection with the Delhi elections.

During a brief chat with reporters here on Thursday, Singh said that PM Narendra Modi never waits for taking major decisions whether it is abrogation of article 370 or formation of a trust in view of the Supreme Court’s directive for the construction of Ram temple in Ayodhya.

Targeting the Samajwadi Party and Bahujan Samaj Party, Singh said that instead of taunting the government on law and order, the SP and the BSP should review themselves to find out why they failed to retain power in the state. he accused them of promoting goonda elements and discrimination on basis of caste and region.

Before leaving the city for Sonbhadra, Singh offered prayers at Kashi Vishwanath and Kaal Bhairo temples. He also met party workers and office bearers in the district.

PATNA: The Patna high court on Thursday ordered formation of a committee headed by principal secretary of art, culture and youth affairs department to chalk out plans for preservation and renovation of Mundeshwari temple atop Kaimur hills and submit a report on it within five weeks.

Bihar Religious Trust Board (BRTB) president, Archaeological Survey of India’s regional head and Kaimur district magistrate would also be a member of the committee headed by principal secretary, who has also been made a respondent in the case. The matter will come up for hearing again on March 16 when the committee will have to submit its report.

The temple, constructed in 108AD, is considered as oldest living temple in country.

One Gaurav Kumar Singh had filed a PIL in high court, urging it to direct the officials concerned to take steps for protection and preservation of temple and its deities, construction of boundary wall, deployment of CISF for security and development of the area as a pilgrimage and tourist spot.

A division bench of Chief Justice Sanjay Karol and Justice Mohit Kumar Shah passed the order after petitioner’s counsel Sumeet Kumar Singh claimed that there was lack of coordination between separate wings of the state government on the matter.

Senior advocate Ganpati Trivedi, who appeared for BRTB, informed the court that the board was ready to reconstruct the temple if given the responsibility. However, additional solicitor general S D Sanjay, appearing for ASI, submitted that it was a protected monument and construction cannot be made by any entity.

HC lawyers may refrain from work: The coordination committee of all three associations of lawyers in Patna high court on Thursday once again passed a resolution, urging the lawyers to refrain from work on Friday and Monday over alleged problems arising out of the listing pattern of the case. The committee will against hold a meeting on Monday to decide its further course of action. Committee chairman Yogesh Chandra Verma said that there was massive resentment among lawyers over the issue of case listing pattern.

SURAT: Income tax department has started investigation against a real estate firm in connection with Rs135 crore cash transactions in its projects across the city.

The I-T department has sought details of the cash transactions and property documents seized by Directorate General of GST Intelligence (DGGI) from the real estate firm for GST evasion to the tune of Rs18 crore.

The DGGI’s Surat regional unit had arrested a real estate developer from the city for evading GST payments to the tune of Rs18 crore on Tuesday. The accused was presented before Surat district and sessions court which sent him to judicial custody for 14 days.

The officials had conducted searches at various locations in the city owned by Raj Mahal Developers , a partnership firm engaged in construction of commercial projects and shopping malls in November 2019. The DGGI sleuths had received intelligence that the firm was indulging in GST evasion on a huge scale.

Sources said the officials had recovered many incriminating documents, including dairies relating to investments and cash received from their clients after sale of various projects to them in the city.

The partner of the firm had admitted to cash receipts of more than Rs135 crore on which more than Rs16 crore of GST was not paid. In addition, he had also not paid GST of more than Rs2.8 crore from April 2018 onwards on cheque components of sale proceeds.

I-T department sources said the real estate firm has done cash dealings worth Rs135 crore and that the realtor did not pay tax to the government and also evaded GST. Details of cash receipts and other documents have been sought from DGGI for further investigation.

A 33-year-old Adajan resident has been admitted to New Civil Hospital (NCH).Results of the two other patients — a 41-year-old Varachha resident and the 21-year-old MBBS girl student from Puna area — are likely to come in a couple of days. Meanwhile, they are admitted in the isolation ward of the SMIMER hospital.The patient approached the NCH on his own, and he was not under observation of the health department of the Surat Municipal Corporation ( SMC ). According to the procedure, local health officials are supposed to keep a traveller, who has returned from China recently, under observation for 14 days.The SMC’s health department was not provided name and details of the patient by the central government to keep him under medical observation. So far, the state and city health officials claimed that they were keeping a watch on all the individual who had returned from China.“The man was not in our list and we were not examining him on daily basis.

He returned on January 21, and since his health did not improve, he approached the NCH on Thursday.“Since the man did not come directly from China it was not in the list provided by the central government.

CRPF officers lay a wreath on the coffin of martyred CRPF jawan Ramesh Ranjan at Patna airport.

PATNA/ARA: With moist eyes and a heavy heart, hundreds of people bade farewell to martyred CRPF jawan , Ramesh Ranjan (30), who was killed in a gunbattle with militants on the outskirts of Srinagar on Wednesday. His mortal remains were consigned to flames at Isadhi Dev Tola, his native village under Jagdishpur block in Bhojpur district, with full state honours on Thursday.

Governor Phagu Chauhan and chief minister Nitish Kumar expressed their grief over the death of Ranjan and said in their condolence messages that the people of the state would always remember the valour and bravery of the son of the soil. State transport minister Santosh Kumar Nirala was also present at the funeral of the departed jawan in his native village.

Wails and cries of family members and close relatives rent the air when the slain jawan’s body reached the village from the Patna airport in a truck. His wife, Baby Devi, and mother, Sumitra Devi, paid tributes to him before the body draped in the national flag was taken for the last rites to an agricultural field near his ancestral house.

Talking to mediapersons, Ranjan’s father, Radhamohan Singh, a retired sub-inspector of police, said, “We do not need any compensation. Awarding the Param Vir Chakra to my son will be a real tribute to him for the supreme sacrifice that he made at the altar of the nation. A gate should also be constructed at our village in his memory.”

Singh had talked to Ranjan around 5pm on Tuesday. “Everything was fine. He had promised to come home either on Holi or after the festival, but destiny had something else in store for him and us. I am proud of my son, who sacrificed his life for the sake of the country,” the slain jawan’s father said.

Ranjan, the youngest of four siblings, had married Baby in 2016, but the couple has no children. He joined the CRPF’s 73rd battalion in 2011 and got his first posting in Odisha’s Sambalpur district.

“I am more concerned about Ranjan’s wife because she is too young to know the harsh reality of the world,” a close relative rued.

Earlier, a number of VIPs, including road construction minister Nand Kishor Yadav, additional chief secretary Amir Subhani, DGP Gupteshwar Pandey, Patna DM Kumar Ravi, former Union minister Kanti Singh, state Congress president Madan Mohan Jha and several senior officials of the CRPF paid floral tributes to the martyred jawan when his body landed at the Patna airport from Jammu in the morning. People shouted slogans like ‘Bharat Maata Ki Jai’ and ‘Veer Saput Amar Rahe’.

The Bihar police were embarrassed after rifles fell ‘silent’ during the funeral of martyred CRPF jawan , Ramesh Ranjan, at his native village in Bhojpur district on Thursday. Eyewitnesses said only two guns fired bullets while others fell silent on the occasion. A similar scene was witnessed during the last rites of former chief minister Jagannath Mishra in Supaul district last year.

Existing two common classroom buildings will be demolished to build two multi-storey classroom complexes

Surat: Sardar Vallabhbhai National Institute of Technology, which has been grappling with controversies and financial problems for the past five years, is all set for a makeover which aims at providing better facilities to over 4,500 students. The institute will soon be taking up six construction projects on its campus which include a multi-storey administrative building, two classroom complexes , a mega food mess , residential quarters for non-teaching staff and a boys hostel. Currently, top officials of the institute operate from a single storey structure which is not in good condition.

The existing administrative building will be demolished and important administrative offices will be accommodated at one place. The existing two common classroom buildings will be also demolished to build two multi-storey classroom complexes. The classroom complexes are for expert lectures on subjects common in different branches of engineering. The bigger classrooms with seating capacity for over 200 students will make it convenient for teachers, who now have to teach in small groups in different departments.

The mega food mess is a new concept in the institute which has separate messes in eight hostels. “Students have to go to their respective hostels which are at the other end for lunch. Now, we are developing a common mess for all boy students near the academic area,” said S R Gandhi, director, SVNIT.

“The common mess means good quality food at better rates because the mess operator will be providing food in quantity. Cost on infrastructure will also get reduced,” Gandhi added.

A new hostel for 500 boy students and two residential towers for non-teaching staff are also being built for which Ministry of Human Resource Development is providing grants.

Water harvesting project

A mega water harvesting project is also coming up on the south western border of the institute. “The project is being developed under Jalshakti campaign. The water that used to flow into storm water drainage will be collected on campus now,” S R Gandhi said. At present, the project is at planning level.

Silawat visited the survivors — Jagdish Radheshyam Sharma, 45, Vinod Tulsiram Mukati, 43, Ravi Patel, 38, and Jagdish Poonamchand Sharma — at Choithram Hospital, and announced a compensation of Rs 2 lakh to the family of Ganesh, who was killed in the brutal attack. All four are stable in ICU, but they will be under observation for 24 hours because of head injuries, said Dr Amit Bhatt, deputy director medical services at Choithram.

Silawat condemned the violence and assured that every guilty person would be brought to justice. Police have identified around 30 people, and arrested three, he added.

DGP V K Singh, who was in the city on Thursday, said, “It is an unfortunate incident. I appeal to people not to be a part of any violent activity and use their mind before believing any rumour.""

Asked about allegations that some policemen were seen standing on the site of the lynching, the DGP said: “Police have a limitation in case of mob attack. But police can’t shy away from their responsibility. We have suspended five policemen, including a sub-inspector, and departmental action will be taken against all responsible for it. However, the people filming and watching the gruesome incident should have also tried to stop it.” Higher education minister Jitu Patwari met the bereaved family of Ganesh and attended his last rites. He then visited the injured in hospital. Congress MLAs Sanjay Shukla and Kunal Choudhary accompanied Patwari. “It is a very shameful incident. The CM has directed police to take stringent action against culprits,” he said.

Sumitra Mahajan in Indore said the incident showed the people were not happy with the police in the Congress-ruled state.

""We have to ponder why our society is losing cool over petty issues and indulging in violence. Common people are dissatisfied with the police,"" the former Indore MP said.

""This tendency of mob violence is increasing, and it is obviously not a good thing. We have to remain human,"" she added. TNN

44,['7/02/2020'],Have an issue with boss? Speak up: Cos,"This story is from February 7, 2020

Namrata Singh | TNN

Mumbai: Employees are becoming more vocal in expressing their concerns at the workplace, but the fear of retaliation is still very palpable. What people today seek from their workplace — apart from the usual satisfaction factors that a job provides — is psychological safety. Most organisations have policies to ensure the physical and mental well-being of their employees. Now some are creating a comfort culture for employees to speak up without the fear of retaliation.

In her previous role as a sales manager at a telecom company, Shachi Irde recalls how sales meetings used to be brutal and scathing for those who had failed to meet their targets. Offsites, however, were a time when employees would get back at their boss. They would take up issues with the boss on how the requisite support was not provided to meet targets and, yet, how they were humiliated during sales meetings.

“Offsite time was used by all — right from the junior most to the senior most employee — to give vent to their feelings. It was a time to get the negativity out of our system. The offsite remained a psychologically safe place for me as I knew I could say what was on my mind without the fear of retaliation. The next day was business as usual,” recalls Irde, who is now the chief consulting partner at Interweave, a diversity and inclusion consulting firm.

Organisations are increasingly talking about how a workplace can be a psychologically safe place for employees across levels to speak up if they feel they have been wronged or if they see bad behaviour at work. Schneider Electric enables psychological safety at the workplace through a combination of interventions for physical, mental, social and emotional well-being.

Schneider Electric India director (rewards) Barun Sen said, “An interesting practice that a lot of us have started doing is a ‘well-being’ check — whether it’s at the start of a meeting, a conference call or even a townhall. It’s simple — we put up a slide with a whole lot of emoticons (sad, angry, curious, bored, happy) and ask our teammates to choose the one with which they identify the most. It creates a culture of starting off on a fun note and for the leader of the meeting/session, it’s also an easy pulse check of your teammates. This, according to us, is a very practical way of ensuring psychological safety.”

On the other hand, an anonymous “red line” mechanism for reporting a violation is managed centrally and is meant to assure people that their grievances will be heard and addressed. “If an employee is not allowed to speak up and voice their concerns, Schneider Electric as an organisation will not be able to learn and move ahead. Similarly, if a team member feels ‘heard’ by her/his team and manager, she/he is better able to innovate, to brainstorm and to offer ideas that will ultimately strengthen the organisation,” said Sen.

Experts, however, argue that a workplace is not entirely psychologically safe if an employee feels the need to hide behind anonymity while raising issues. Professional services firm EY has a programme called ‘Counselling Families’, wherein a leader meets his team of 20-30 people once every two months to not only apprise them about the business but also to listen to their queries.

EY India partner and talent leader Sandeep Kohli said, “At Counselling Families, employees are encouraged to speak up on any issue of concern, without the fear of retaliation. Two years since this programme was started, anonymous complaints as a percentage of total strength has come down.”

The second leg of the policy framework is that EY is conducting inclusive leadership workshops in which leaders are sensitised. Then these leaders, in turn, are trained to sensitise managers and senior managers down the line to build a culture where people can openly come up and raise concerns, if any. “The key highlight of our policies is that there cannot be any retaliation if a concern is raised. Since we have initiated frameworks through which we listen to employees and connect with them on a regular basis, we see that the need to use the formal forums is reducing,” said Kohli.

Vadodara: A sessions court on Thursday sentenced a 37-year-old labourer to five years imprisonment for culpable homicide not amounting to murder. Rohit Chauhan was arrested in 2018 for killing his wife Lalli at their home in Kalali.

Lalli’s mother Sharda Ninama, who is a ragpicker, had filed a complaint against Rohit, who had married Lalli nine years ago. They had six children, three boys and three girls. In August 2018, Lalli wasn’t keeping well so Sharda went to see her daughter at her home. When Sharda reached Lalli’s home, Rohit was present along with his two daughters.

He told Sharda that Lalli was sleeping and requested her not to wake her up. But Sharda tried to wake up Lalli who didn’t respond. She then noticed blood flowing out of Lalli’s nose and some injury on her forehead. When Sharda confronted Rohit, he admitted to have had a fight with Lalli following which he smashed her head on the wall. Lalli’s daughters too told Sharda that there was a fight between their parents the previous night.

The court ruled that the accused committed culpable homicide not amounting to murder and sentenced him to five years of rigorous imprisonment. Rohit has been ordered to pay fine of Rs 10,000 and if he doesn’t pay the fine, he will have to undergo a further one year simple imprisonment. Out of the fine received, Rs 9,000 would be given to Sharda as compensation.

46,['7/02/2020'],"RJD plays quota card to woo EBCs, dalits in Bihar","This story is from February 7, 2020

An RJD poster in Patna on Thursday.

PATNA: Apart from its traditional voter base of Muslims and Yadavs, Lalu Prasad-led Rashtriya Janata Dal ( RJD ) is also trying to woo extremely backward caste (EBC) and dalit voters ahead of the assembly elections in the state. It has announced 27% reservation for EBCs and 18% for dalits as far as appointment of district presidents of the party is concerned. The list of 50 district presidents of the party is likely to be released on Friday.

Earlier, the party had made Rajput stalwart Jagdanand Singh its state president to attract upper caste votes. “RJD is the only party in the state to give such reservation to its functionaries. We treat all castes and communities equally,” party spokesperson Chitranjan Gagan said.

Jagdanand said though the new list of district presidents of RJD was initially supposed to be released on Wednesday, it was postponed by two days as leader of opposition in Bihar assembly Tejashwi Prasad Yadav was campaigning for Delhi polls.

Party sources said the new list may not have names of some old war horses of RJD who have served the party for more than two or three terms as district president. “The number of Yadavs and Muslims in the list will come down. However, party will accommodate these netas in other cells,” said an RJD functionary.

Sources said there was uncertainty regarding the retention of party’s Patna district president Devmuni Singh Yadav and Patna Mahanagar president Aftab Alam as well. “After finalizing the names, Laluji sent the list to Tejashwi,” said another RJD functionary.

The party may also announce the names of its 135 state level office-bearers on Friday with representation from different castes. Sources, however, said reservation formula as applied in selection of district president would not be applied in case of office-bearers.

The meeting of RJD’s legislature party members will be held on February 8. It will be followed by the meeting of its new district presidents on February 9 and state office-bearers on February 10.

47,['7/02/2020'],Mah foresters given no papers on T-19 probe by MP,"This story is from February 7, 2020

Nagpur: Madhya Pradesh forest officials investigating the Sharmili (T-19) tigress death case at Khandasa on Maharashtra border , near Deolapar, have refused to share relevant papers related to the investigations with forest officials here.

On February 1, Seoni forest officials had publicly alleged that Deolapar foresters had moved the carcass of Sharmili with the help of a bullock cart to dump it at Khandasa in Madhya Pradesh, near Khawasa.

The allegations are based on confessional statement by temporary forest labourer Dhamsingh Khandate, who, after being arrested by MP officials, had told them that Deolapar round officer Salim Razzak Khan had directed him to shift the carcass on the night of December 10, 2019, towards Khawasa.

Stunned by the allegations, Nagpur chief conservator of forests (CCF) P Kalyan Kumar had ordered a probe and spoken to his counterpart RS Kori in Seoni, who promised to hand over relevant papers to the team from Nagpur.

However, according to sources, Ramtek ACF Sandeep Giri and Deolapar RFO SG Parihar went to Seoni twice on February 3 and 5, but MP officials refused to share the investigation papers.

Kori said, “Maharashtra officials had met me and deputy conservator (DyCF) but I’m not aware whether the papers have been handed over or not. I will confirm and let you know.”

Kori further added, “No further arrests have been made.”

Maharashtra officials said on condition of anonymity, “A tiger cannot be dumped by a lone person and there must be at least 5-6 persons. Why were the others not arrested? We are doing a parallel investigations. MP officials have promised to hand over probe papers.”

PATNA: Smart Cities Mission director Rahul Kapoor has suggested that the launch of the 72-foot-high mega screen at Gandhi Maidan should be a grand affair. He along with other officials had inspected several ongoing projects under the Patna Smart City Limited (PSCL) on Wednesday.

According to sources, the mega screen was used on a trial basis on February 1 and is likely to be launched by the end of February.

PSCL public relations officer (PRO) Harshita told this newspaper that the videos to be played on the mega screen would first be shortlisted.

“Altogether 5,000 people will be able to watch films, matches and popular shows on the screen. It will also be used for displaying events that require outdoor projection,” she said and added that additional security forces would be deployed at Gandhi Maidan after the launch of the screen.

The mega screen, which was installed utilizing an estimated outlay of Rs 6.98 crore, will help create an amphitheatre experience at Gandhi Maidan.

Patnaites, especially youngsters, are elated by the mega screen project. “Patna lacks an amphitheatre where a large number of people can watch matches together. With the launch of the mega screen at Gandhi Maidan, we will have a common place to watch football, cricket and hockey matches,” said Yash Singh, a resident of Kankarbagh.

The Smart Cities Mission director also asked the PSCL officials to complete redevelopment work of the Adalatganj pond before the upcoming assembly elections.

The pond, which is being redeveloped at a cost of Rs 9.8 crore, will have attractions like open-air theatre, musical-cum-lighting fountain, aeration fountain, playing area for kids, benches, walking pathways, garden and vehicle-parking space.

PATNA: Atomic Energy Commission’s former chairman and nuclear scientist Ratan Kumar Sinha has asserted that India has now become self-dependent in energy sector by generating surplus energy.

Addressing the students and faculty members of Munger University on Thursday, Sinha observed that by developing thorium, a weakly radioactive metallic chemical element, as an alternative to uranium (not plenty in India) scientists have been able to enhance the energy production considerably in recent years.

“Today, India is not only meeting its own energy requirements, but also exporting them to other countries,” he said.

Sinha clarified that nuclear energy can be safely used to boost production and enhance national economy. He pointed out that coal-based energy results in carbon emission, leading to global warming.

“Due to erratic climate pattern, more coolers and heaters are being used, resulting in greater carbon emission. Thus, a vicious cycle is formed, making life miserable,” Sinha said, adding youths should utilize their scientific knowledge in meeting the challenges of nature and mitigating the sufferings of the people.

Sinha, who is currently associated with Bhabha Atomic Research Centre (BARC), accepted the proposal of Munger University’s vice-chancellor Ranjit Kumar Verma for counselling local university students by BARC scientists.

GAYA: More than 200 delegates from different parts of the country are attending the three-day ‘All-India English Teachers’ Conference’, which began in Magadh University (MU) on Thursday.

This is for the first time that the annual conference is being organized in Bihar . Its theme is ‘An Overview of Literatures in English Language: Continuity and Departure’.

Delivering the keynote address during the inaugural session, Nalanda University vice-chancellor (VC) Sunaina Singh exhorted the participants to religiously follow the teaching protocol and enter the classrooms fully prepared. She regretted that the level of dedication among teachers had diminished and the trend needed early and effective reversal.

The VC also denounced the tendency to look westward for quality literature. She said, “With a 5000-year-long history, the Indian literary treasure is very rich. For a long time, India enjoyed the position of ‘vishva guru’. It is high time we rediscovered our country’s glorious past and lived it once again.”

MU VC Rajendra Prasad requested littérateurs to spread the message of love and compassion. He said, “The atmosphere of hate has to be replaced with mutual love and respect.”

Referring to the threat posed to human existence by global warming, he pointed out it was the responsibility of littérateurs to create awareness about its dangers.

Buddhist scholars from Taiwan at Biharsharif.

BIHARSHARIF: A 30-member delegation of Buddhist scholars from Taiwan were disappointed after they failed to locate the remains of the ancient Odantapuri University in Biharsharif on Wednesday. It is believed to have existed till the 13th century AD.

Li Wen, one of the scholars from Taiwan, told this newspaper on Thursday, “According to ancient scriptures, the founder of the Pala dynasty, King Gopala, had built a university of Buddhist learning called ‘vihara’ inside his fort at Odantapuri in the 7th century AD. It was referred to as ‘Adband’ by Arab writers and as ‘Odyantapuri’ by Taranatha, a Lama of the Jonang school of Tibetan Buddhism. In 1197AD, Turkish invader Bakhtiyar Khilji attacked the fort and destroyed the university.”

Wen pointed out that the present government should have taken steps to ensure that some parts of the ancient structure were preserved. “An excavation can still bring out the structure buried underneath,” he said.

Executive director of Bihar Heritage Development Society , Bijoy Kumar Chaudhary, however, claimed that there was limited scope for excavation as the present day Biharsharif was densely populated.

“No remains of Odantapuri University, which was a seat of learning of Buddhism in the early medieval period, could be found because it was largely destroyed by Khilji. Besides, the dense population of Biharsharif leaves very little scope for excavation of the site,” Chaudhary claimed.

Patna-based author Naushad Ansari said, “Odantapuri Vihara was damaged when the Turkish Army led by Bakhtiyar Khilji had invaded the fort.”

PATNA: Efforts made by Patna DM Kumar Ravi to introduce alternative measures for removal of garbage and continuation of other civic services in the city failed to yield desired results as garbage strewn on roads could be removed from only two of six circles of Patna Municipal Corporation (PMC) on Thursday.

The sanitation work resumed in several areas in Patliputra and New Capital circles, including Fraser road, Dak Bunglow crossing, Punaichak, Raj Bhavan, Secretariat, Eco Park, Maurya Lok Complex and Boring road. Garbage strewn on roads was carted away using automatic sweeping machines amid heavy deployment of police forces.

The DM had issued an order on Wednesday for formation of one team each in all six circles of PMC for removal of garbage accumulated on roads due to the indefinite strike of group D employees of PMC, mainly sanitation workers. However, the additional teams were confronted by the agitating sanitation workers in two circles late on Wednesday evening, following which police action was initiated.

“Three separate FIRs were lodged at Sachivalaya, Bahadurpur and Alamganj police stations against more than 25 unidentified people for causing hindrance in garbage removal work. Three sanitary inspectors of Patna City circle were suspended for not joining the alternative measures proposed by the district administration,” the DM said on Thursday.

Shailesh Kumar, executive officer of New Capital Circle of PMC, said cleanliness work was carried out in several localities. “We have started with cleaning the main roads, which will be followed by removal of garbage from other localities. All the auto tippers parked at Mithapur yard were punctured by the protesting sanitation workers,” he said.

Kumar added, “Anti-mosquito fumigation also started on Fraser Road and at Dak Bunglow crossing and Punaichak.”

S K Mishra, executive officer of Patna City and Azimabad circles of PMC, said garbage cleaning work had not resumed in the circle due to lack of police force. “On Wednesday night, we cleaned the dumped garbage from Chowk area and Shikarpur Chowk in Patna City area. But we cannot carry out the cleaning work without force. Most police officers are on Intermediate examination duty,” he said.

Bankipore’s executive officer Tarun said some permanent sanitation workers along with senior officials had tried to collect auto tippers from Mithapur yard, but they were chased away by the striking sanitation workers.

58,['7/02/2020'],PSBs education loans approval rate shrinks 24% in three years,"Chennai: Stringent disbursement norms coupled with downturn in engineering education admissions resulted in a 24% decline in education loan approvals by State-owned banks in the last three years.In a Lok Sabha reply, the Ministry of Finance said the approval of education loans decreased to 1.64 lakh applications as of December, 2019 from 2.16 lakh reported in 2017-18.This drop is seen after an increase recorded in the number of loan applications approved from 1.96 lakh to 2.16 lakh between 2016-17 and 2017-18.These are loans under the guidelines of Model Educational Loan Scheme laid down by Indian Banks’ Association (IBA) which have to disposed off by banks within 15 days to one month of the receipt of loan application and communication of decision on sanction or rejection within 15-day deadline.Seeing not much uptake in the educational loan approval rate, a Canara Bank official said, “We are maintaining education loans sanctioned at the level of 30,000 applications. We have seen a marginal drop in education loans sanctioned by 200-300 applications this year. Many people not choosing professional courses — engineering, agriculture, veterinary sciences, law — compared to last few years, and instead opt for basic degrees courses which do not require a loan.”Canara Bank’s approved applications remain stagnant at 30,000 for the last three years.However, the State-owned bank's value of education loan sanctioned and disbursed were rising.The official also said, “While, underemployment is the biggest concern for us, if we take nursing courses where fees are charged exorbitantly like 5-6 lakh, and another 2-3 lakh will be added to the principle borrowed amount if there is no interest subsidy adding up to a total of 8 lakh. In such a case, the interest payment stands at 10,000-15,000 per month for a nurse who earns 6,000-7,000 per month. Similar situations of unemployment and underemployment is seen in the engineering space, where the fees are much higher with poor job guarantee.”“It is not just the responsibility of public sector banks to provide financial aid to students of low-end income group, while politicians must fight for it too. No political party seem to push this pressing issue of slowdown in sanction of education loans,” K Srinivasan of the Education Loan Task Force, a voluntary organization that seeks to raise awareness about how to go about applying for an education loan. The Reserve Bank of India’s monthly report on deployment of bank credit by major sectors showed disbursement by select 39 scheduled commercial banks stands at fell 6% year-on-year in educational loans under the priority sector segment and 3.2% under the personal loan segment as of December 20, 2019.",business,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-47529300,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-110164,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/psbs-education-loans-approval-rate-shrinks-24-in-three-years/articleshow/73992541.cms

Mumbai: In his opening statement following the monetary policy committee, RBI governor Shaktikanta Das warned against trying to second-guess the central bank.

“While the decision may be along expected lines, and perhaps widely discounted, it is important not to discount the RBI,” Das said. RBI’s policy did not cut rates on Thursday, but there was a slew of measures to ensure that the 135-basis-point (100bps = 1 percentage point) reduction in policy rates in 2019 gets passed on to borrowers. Excerpts from a press conference:

Are the measures to reduce reserve requirement and infuse liquidity in the money markets like a hidden rate cut in the policy?

It is an effort to ensure better monetary policy transmission. We want to inject Rs 1 lakh crore into the banking system. Because we are lending it at the policy rate, it will enable banks to bring down their lending rates. Notwithstanding the 135bps reduction in the repo rate, there is also a need for sufficient liquidity. Corporate bonds are benchmarked to rates in the government securities segment. If we are able to bring down yields on government bonds, that acts as a benchmark for lending. When the banks get cheaper funds, it will quicken the process of transmission.

On room to cut rates in future...

In 2019, there were a lot of surprises, including unseasonal rains that increased the price of onions, which contributed over 200bps to inflation. We have policy space, but it will depend on the evolving situation, and the monetary policy committee in 2020 will be very proactive and act ahead of time, as it has done in 2019.

What is the purpose of having special government securities in the Budget where non-residents can invest without limits?

The primary objective of this is to ensure that it reflects the robustness of the Indian economy...that we can mobilise and absorb so much foreign capital to meet our domestic requirement. But this investment will flow in rupees and not dollars. By mobilising foreign savings, the pressure on domestic savings to meet the requirements of the government — to that extent they also get minimised.

The FRBM Act trigger clause allows the government to monetise fiscal deficit with the RBI. Is that a concern?

Let me be very clear: Now there is no plan of monetising the fiscal deficit. Despite the fiscal deficit going to 3.8%, market borrowing remains the same. Next year, it goes up by only Rs 70,000 crore which, as a percentage of GDP, is lower than the current year.

Indore: Former Lok Sabha Speaker and senior BJP leader Sumitra Mahajan has written to chief minister Kamal Nath , objecting to the ongoing statewide protests against CAA , NRC and NPA.

Urging the CM to ensure peace, Mahajan writes: “For many days, dharna/protests are going on against CAA, NRC and NPA, but as you know, the central government is not implementing NRC and the Union home minister cleared the same today in his reply to a question in Lok Sabha.” Mahajan mentions that CAA has been amended to give shelter to people of minority communities in Afghanistan, Bangladesh and Pakistan, “who are facing anarchy and injustice there”. “It is clear that nobody’s rights (In India) will be snatched (due to the Act). Still, protests are going on,” she writes.

“I get tense when outsiders participate in such protests and give inflammatory speeches. A similar incident was reported recently in Indore. Someone dared to say that citizenship ‘should also be given to intruders’,” says her letter, urging the CM to “pay attention to such incidents”.

“As you know, citizenship comes under central government’s jurisdiction. It can make a law on it and if states have any objection, they can move Supreme Court. But what’s going on is not right. The country — and specially Indore — are on the path of peace and progress and we are all working for it. In this scenario, everybody wishes that peace should be maintained,” she writes.

Reacting to the letter, MPCC spokesperson Nilabh Shukla said: “It is an unnecessary attempt by Mahajan to show she is active during her political exile. All her allegations are baseless. I would urge the former Lok Sabha Speaker to expose the so-called ‘outsiders’, who gave inflammatory speeches, with proof.” TNN

63,['7/02/2020'],Deposit cover premium to increase marginally,"MUMBAI: The five-fold increase in deposit insurance will not have a significant impact on banks’ balance sheets. The RBI has increased the premium on bank deposits by only 20% to 12 paise from 10 paise for every Rs 100.“The premium is something which we are considering. It will be increased from 10 paise to 12 paise per hundred rupees for the time being. So, the impact on the banks’ balance — it is not likely to be so much,” said RBI deputy governor B P Kanungo .Earlier, analysts had estimated that a five-fold increase in the deposit insurance cover might add up to 25 basis points (100bps = 1 percentage point) of their aggregate deposits. Given that total bank deposits are Rs 131 lakh crore, the increase in premium for one year will boost the deposit insurance fund by Rs 2,620 crore.Kanungo pointed out that the Deposit Insurance and Credit Guarantee Corporation (DICGC) pays out claims only at the time of liquidation. However, he added, there is also a scheme where the DICGC provides compensation under restructuring plans for reviving the bank. This is a big positive for stressed co-operative banks as it would be possible for the DICGC to fill in to make a takeover proposal viable. Responding to a query on Punjab and Maharashtra Co-operative (PMC) Bank, RBI governor Shaktikanta Das said that the administrator and the advisory committee are having greater clarity with regard to the financial position of the bank and are working on their next course of action.The DICGC received total premium income of Rs 12,043 crore from banks in 2018-19. The deposit insurance fund amounted to Rs 93,750 crore in FY19.

At an anti-CAA public meeting at Masaurhi on Wednesday, Tej had said, “I have given new name to Nitish Kumar and henceforth he is Nitish Kumari, similarly Sushil Kumar Modi is Sushil Kumari,” Tej said.

Training guns at another NDA leader, Tej had said, “Do not sit at home wearing bangles, rather come and talk directly.”

Tej’s statements irked the NDA functionaries who demanded an apology from him as well as the RJD. JD(U) spokesperson Rajiv Ranjan asked Tej to apologize from entire Bihar for insulting the CM and the deputy CM. “He has even embarrassed his party people. Such statements are Tej Pratap’s identity,” Ranjan said.

Waghodiya BJP MLA and Gujarat Agro Industries Corporation (GAIC) chairman Madhu Shrivastava

VADODARA: Waghodiya BJP MLA and Gujarat Agro Industries Corporation (GAIC) chairman Madhu Shrivastava is mired in yet another controversy.

This time around an audio clip of a conversation replete with expletives exchanged between him and a man belonging to Porbandar is making rounds on the social media.

In the audio, the conversation begins with the man named Raj Odedara expressing sympathy with Shrivastava over the MLA’s recent comments accusing government officials of not taking up his suggested works.

The conversation, however, soon turned ugly with Shrivastava hurling an abuse at Odedara. The caller too shot back with a deluge of abuses.

The exchange continues throughout the call with both Shrivastava and Odedara claiming in the conversation that they were in an inebriated condition. In the last part of the conversation, somebody else can also be heard abusing Odedara.

When contacted, Odedara admitted that he had called Shrivastava. “I have interest in politics. Shrivastava abused me first and hence I loss my cool too,” Odedara said. He added that he had not been called by Shrivastava or the police later. In the call, Shrivastava had threatened to take up the matter with the police.

Odedara added that on Thursday he had received a call from a person claiming to be a builder. “He told me that Shrivastava was not a bad person and helped poor people a lot,” he claimed. He added that he used to work for former state Congress president Arjun Modhwadia before 2012, but later parted ways and even canvassed against Modhwadia.

PATNA: Deputy CM Sushil Kumar Modi on Thursday said the state government would adopt a policy soon making the use of fly ash-based bricks in the construction of all government buildings mandatory, as part of its initiative to protect the fertile top soil of arable and other land which is otherwise used in the making of bricks.

Modi said the government has periodically taken initiatives to improve and monitor air quality too. “In accordance with the same, the use of all 15-year-old diesel-based government vehicles was banned in the state. Similarly, the use of 15-year-old vehicles has been banned in the areas falling under Patna Municipal Corporation and urban local bodies of Danapur, Khagaul and Phulwarisharif,” Modi said.

The deputy CM was addressing the pre-budget consultative meet on environment conservation and pollution control organized at the auditorium of old secretariat to solicit suggestions from participants for likely consideration for inclusion in the 2020-21 state budget. Principal secretaries of finance and environment departments – S Siddharth and Dipak Kumar Singh, respectively – and Bihar Pollution Control Board chairman A K Ghosh also participated in it.

Modi gave details of the other recent initiatives taken by the government to address environmental concerns of people in the state and improve air quality in Patna, Muzaffarpur, Gaya, Bhagalpur and Hajipur.

71,['7/02/2020'],Stressed commercial realty projects get relief from RBI,"(Representative image)

MUMBAI: In a major relief for developers of commercial real estate (CRE), the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has allowed banks to restructure loans by delaying the completion date. This means that in the case of stressed borrowers, banks can give them more time to repay without classifying the developer as a defaulter, or the loan as a non-performing asset (NPA).Commercial real estate refers to projects other than housing, which include office buildings. In its policy, RBI said banks can extend the date of commercial operation of project loans for CRE projects by one year without downgrading the asset classification.“This is a big move and will bring much-needed relief to the cash-starved real estate sector, and to both developers and the housing finance corporations (HFCs) from the liquidity perspective. It will help ease out the time for maintaining and managing cash flows for cash-strapped developers and help them to complete several stuck projects,” said Anarock Property Consultants chairman Anuj Puri.However, he added that this will not address the other main issue prevailing in the real estate sector — the continuing low demand. Also, while the move will prevent stressed projects from falling into the NPA category, it will not enable banks to lend to projects classified as NPA.Stocks of real estate companies gained following the announcement (see graphic). Among realty companies, Godrej Properties rose 1.8%, Sobha jumped 1.4%, Indiabulls Real Estate 1.16%, Prestige Estates Projects 1.09%, and Oberoi Realty 0.5%. Indiabulls Housing Finance, which has a significant exposure to real estate, was the biggest gainer with share price closing 15% up at Rs 319. LIC housing finance too gained 8% to close at Rs 438.Announcing the relaxation in his post-policy press conference, RBI governor Shaktikanta Das said that it would complement the measures taken by the government in the Union Budget. “In the commercial estate sector, there are many incomplete projects. The dispensation is basically to deal with incomplete projects, which got delayed for reasons beyond their control because of some environment clearance getting delayed, or some court case or some other kind of impediment which came in their way,” said Das.“It is estimated that around Rs 400 crore loans to commercial real estate could be benefited. This will help banks, developers to overcome the stressed issues in the sector,” said SBI Group chief economist Soumya Kanti Ghosh.“After the asset quality review of 2015, RBI has been avoiding forebearance for stressed loans. This is the first time that RBI has permitted this for large loans. At this time the economy needs such decisions as real estate is already facing lack of demand. Giving them relief instead of tightening the screws is a good move,” said Union Bank of India managing director & CEO Rajkiran Rai.",business,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73998994,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-162020,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/stressed-commercial-realty-projects-get-relief-from-rbi/articleshow/73993793.cms

Their bodies were fished out of the river by fire brigade men on Thursday morning. Savli police have registered a case of accidental death and begun investigations.

Yuvraj Chauhan, 20, and Nilesh Chauhan, 20, both residents of Khorvad village in Anand, called up their friends before taking the plunge into the river. “They first called their relatives and told them that they are leaving their home and planning to end their lives. The relatives frantically asked them the reason, but the duo didn’t reveal anything,” a police official said.

“They then reached the bridge in Poicha village on motorbike and parked it there. Moments before jumping off, they called their friends and said they were going to end their lives. When the friends didn’t believe, the duo made a video call to their friends from the bridge,” the police said. They then kept their mobile phones on the bridge and jumped at about 6.30pm.

Passersby saw them jumping into the river and immediately informed police. Even firemen rushed to the spot but they couldn’t find their bodies in dark.

On Thursday morning, their bodies were found about 50 feet away from the spot where they had jumped.

“The duo belongs to the same family and shared a close bond with each other. They stayed in the same village and were always together. We asked their families but they have no clue why the duo took the extreme step,” said Ganpat Khant, head constable, Savli police station.

While Nilesh is married, Yuvraj is single. The cops are probing if the duo had any financial problems that pushed them to end their lives.

Sources said the loan they took for buying costly mobile phones may be one of the reasons for the suicide.

The high-power steering committee of the smart cities mission gave administrative and technical sanctions for the projects in July and October 2018. It’s more than a year now, and nothing has happened on the proposals so far.

As the sites are protected monuments, it is mandatory for the corporation to get clearances from the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI), which has enforced stiff restrictions on carrying out such beautification works on the sites. The ASI had asked for a revised proposal from the local body to host laser show at Teppakulam tank, said corporation officials.

Since landmarks such as World War Memorial at Gandhi Market and Puradhana Park are not ASI protected monuments, the civic body could complete the beautification work in time.

""ASI has strictly told us not to disturb the physical structures. We are in the process of revising the detailed project report for the proposal to beautify Teppakulam,"" an official source said.

Trichy City Corporation, however, maintained that they have obtained the mandatory clearances from the ASI by rendering an assurance that illumination of the Rockfort hillock and Main Guard gate entrance will not affect the structures and public movement. ""The proposed mode of illuminating the Main Guard gate has to be modified,"" the official added.

The corporation maintained that work on illuminating the Rockfort hillock and Main Guard gate will be initiated shortly. The civic body, however, is uncertain about the fate of the much-hyped historical laser show proposed at Teppakulam tank due to the ASI’s restrictions as well as rampant encroachments near the tank.

78,['7/02/2020'],Many dalits quit BJP over CAA: Leader,"This story is from February 7, 2020

MALAPPURAM: Around 150 dalit BJP members have reportedly resigned from the party in Kuzhimanna panchayat in Malappuram district as a mark of protest against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act ( CAA ).

A group of party workers in Kalathingal-Pullanchery SC colony in Kuzhimanna have submitted their resignation letter to the district committee office.

Meanwhile, BJP district president Ravi Thelath confirmed that he has received the resignation letter from four members.

Jayesh M, joint secretary of the BJP SC colony committee, said that around 30 families in the colony had joined the party six months ago and all of them have decided to quit in protest against CAA. “We feel that the act will divide people on religious grounds. We cannot agree with it,” said Jayesh. He said that they are yet to take a decision on joining any other party.

Meanwhile, Ravi ruled out that the resignation was in protest against CAA.

“Around 40 families of the colony had joined the party six months ago, seeking help to reclaim their graveyard from a man, who claimed ownership rights over it. BJP had offered support to them. But they expected huge financial support from the party for the legal fight. As BJP couldn’t fund their cause, they were disappointed. Now, they are being misguided by some organizations with ulterior motives and are citing CAA as a reason to snap ties,” he said.

79,['7/02/2020'],Kolkata: Cops find ‘gaps’ in Tangra woman’s statement,"Locals block Gobinda Khatick Road on Thursday, demanding that cops bring out the truth

KOLKATA: Two days after an ambulance ran over 52-year-old Gopal Pramanick, seconds after the occupants of the vehicle allegedly tried to kidnap his daughter-in-law Priyanka Pramanick (28), the police claimed to have found several inconsistencies in her statement. After studying a CCTV footage , a senior police officer said: “If the evidence does not add up during the probe, we will lodge an FIR against the complainant.”The cops, however, have started a case under IPC sections 357 (assault or criminal force in attempt wrongfully to confine a person) and 341 (wrongful restraint) along with Section 34, based on the woman’s complaint. This is besides the case under IPC section pertaining to culpable homicide not amounting to murder, which had already been registered.According to police, not only did she conceal the fact that another relative was walking right next to her and her three-year-old daughter, she had also failed to explain why she failed to lodge her complaint immediately after the accident. The CCTV footage runs for 74 seconds from 11.53pm on Tuesday. After the first 32 seconds, Priyanka is seen walking — her daughter on her right and her aunt (mami-shasuri) Rita Pramanik her left — along the left side of the road.A couple of steps behind, Gopal is seen following them. He is actually spotted on the road. Four more relatives — in batches of two each — are seen moving towards their home.The accident took place between 55 and 59 seconds in the 74-second footage and by the 60th second the ambulance is visible with the family members running behind it. “How is it that everything took place in seconds? How can someone stop, converse and then pick up speed that can kill a person by dragging him along?” questioned an IPs officer at Lalbazar.Lalbazar’s response came barely hours after residents of Christopher Road in Tangra took to the road and blocked it claiming the police was deliberately trying to pass off a serious crime against woman and a culpable homicide leading to the death of a 52-year-old man as a mere accident.The protestors blocked GK Road using drums and carried currency notes. “We want to bribe the cops, just as a bribe has let them change the course of this case. May be once we bribe them, they will bring out the truth,” claimed Tapan Pramanick, a relative of the victim.",kolkata,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74000658,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1049630,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/cops-find-gaps-in-tangra-womans-statement/articleshow/73993491.cms

HYDERABAD: Mild tension prevailed at Secunderabad railway station on Thursday after officials received a hoax call stating that a bomb was planted on Vijayawada-Secunderabad Intercity Express train on Thursday.

Soon after the call was received, the Railway Protection Force (RPF), local police, sniffer dogs and bomb disposal squad conducted a thorough checking of the train, but did not find anything.

According to officials, they received the call at around 5.30 am, the train’s departure time. “The train had just left the station when we received the information about the bomb. The train was brought back to the yard and after proper checking, it was found to be a hoax call,” said an SCR spokesperson, adding that the train left over an hour late at 7 am. “We are yet to identify the accused, who told us that two to three persons were involved, while the bomb was planted in Coach 1 and Coach 2,” said a Secunderabad railway police officer.

A case was registered against the offender under relevant sections of the IPC.

81,['7/02/2020'],"Surplus rain scatters bird population, 38% drop in Thamirabarani basin","This story is from February 7, 2020

Madurai: A total of 24,411 birds belonging to 74 species were recorded during the 10th edition of Thamirabarani Waterbird Count (TWC) 2020. This is a drastic drop from the 39,231 birds that were spotted in the last year’s count and 34,189 birds that were spotted in the 8th edition in 2018. Abundance of water in waterbodies spread across the southern districts is said to be the main reason for the drop in numbers.

More than 100 students, farmers, entrepreneurs, housewives, physicians and wildlife and nature enthusiasts from various parts of state took part in the three-day exercise from January 24 to 26. The census was jointly organised by ATREE’s Agasthyamalai Community Conservation Centre, Manimuthar, St John’s College, Palayamkottai, Pearly City Nature Society, Thoothukudi, and Nellai Nature Club.

The participants were divided into six teams to conduct the census in 51 irrigation tanks in Tirunelveli, Thoothukudi and Tenkasi districts. Despite the 38% drop in the total number of birds, there was some excitement in citing the Fulvous Whistling Duck (Dendrocygna Bicolor) for the first time in the census since a decade. It was spotted at Veinthankulam and Karungulam in Thoothukudi district.

Cattle Egret (Bubulcus Ibis) was the bird that was sighted the most in this year’s census. More than 3,840 of these common egrets were spotted this year. A good number of birds were recorded in Vellur (1,602) followed by 1,447 in Kadambakulam, 1,389 in Kaspa, 1,132 in Kuppakurichi and 1,125 in Manur. Bird breeding was recorded at Kazhuvur, Manur, Maranthai and Nainarkulam. Hundreds of Pelicans and Asian Openbills were spotted breeding at Kazhuvur that is located close to Koonthankulam bird sanctuary, Tirunelveli district.

Arjuna (Marutham), Mahua (Illupai) and Palm trees on the bunds at Nainarkulam supported breeding of birds such as Grey Heron and Oriental Darter. Babul trees at Manur and Maranthai supported breeding of Black-headed Ibis, Oriental Darter, Little Cormorant, Indian Shag, Glossy Ibis and the like.

ATREE’s senior research associate M Mathivanan said that bird spotting directly reflects the rainfall received in the region. “The number of birds visiting Tirunelveli and Tuticorin goes down drastically when there is surplus rain across the region during the northeast monsoon. The population gets scattered, with a sizeable population of migratory birds flying to those waterbodies too,” he said.

He observed that last year good rainfall was recorded in neighbouring Ramanathapuram and Virudhunagar districts, which have attracted a share of the birds that used to visit the waterbodies in Thamirabarani basin. According to him, surplus water also makes it difficult for plovers and waders to get food, due to which they could not be spotted in large numbers this time.

Mathivanan who coordinated the census said that the drop this year is not an issue of concern. He said that 67,194 birds, the highest in the TMC census till date, were spotted in 2014 when Thamirabarani received moderate rainfall, while many waterbodies in neighbouring districts such as Virudhunagar and Ramanathapuram went dry. In 2017, the number dropped to a mere 8,256 due to the poor NE monsoon.

Indore: Garden in front of Rajwada will soon become the main attraction of the city with an open-air theatre, more lightings and fountains .

Indore Municipal Corporation (IMC) is now working on preparing a plan to re-develop the garden space which will be used for public gatherings and events.

IMC commissioner Asheesh Singh said that this garden re-development project is a part of their plan to make the entire Rajwada area a ‘no-vehicle’ zone. The project will be taken up under Smart City initiative, and its estimate cost would be around Rs12 crore.

“An initial design has been prepared and a detailed project report is being worked out. If found feasible, then we will implement the project,” said Singh. Officials said that this project is being prepared to improve scenic beauty of the entire area and increase open space.

As per a tentative plan, the entire garden space will be redeveloped as an open-air theatre with steps to provide seating space for visitors.

The garden’s boundary wall near the palace building side will be removed and all palm trees that obstruct building’s view from opposite side will be shifted from the area. However, the statue of Rani Ahilyabai Holkar will be kept intact.

Fountains and decorative lightings will be installed with presence of green islands. A shed, bus stop and parking space will also be developed near MG Road area.

“This design has been prepared while keeping in mind to provide a clear view of Rajwada to visitors from any point of the entire area,” said Vijay Marathe, a consultant with Indore Smart City Development Limited (ISCDL).

The corporation has already decided to completely restrict entry of vehicles in the entire Rajwada Chowk area. And multi-level parking lots have also been planned in the area before enforcing this restriction.

PIMPRI CHINCHWAD: The civic body will open the ramps of the Empire Estate flyover in Chinchwad for vehicular traffic on Friday with BJP corporator Shailesh More withdrawing his opposition to it.

Vijay Bhojane, spokesperson, BRTS cell, PCMC, said, mayor Usha alias Mai Dhore will inaugurate the ramps on Friday.”

In a letter to Shravan Hardikar, municipal commissioner, Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC), on February 3, More had pointed out that many works had not yet been completed due to which the residents of Empire Estate were facing traffic issues.

The BJP corporator said that a meeting was held with the civic officials in presence of prominent residents at his office in Empire Estate in Chinchwad on Thursday. “The officials have assured to start the beautification work under the flyover immediately. Parking for four-wheelers and two-wheelers will be conducted between flyover and ramp pillars. A play area will be created next to senior citizens’ park,” he said.

Sanjeev Shewale, secretary, Empire Estate Federation, said, “We have been opposing the flyover construction before it began five years back but still the flyover was constructed with the assurance that our hardships would be reduced.

87,['7/02/2020'],Two rescued brothers made to live 60-km apart,"This story is from February 7, 2020

Agra: Their lives in disarray, they had each other’s tiny shoulders to cry on. Now, they have none. They grew up together and humbly accepted some of the worst that the life had to offer: Their mother went missing in 2013 and the father was sent to gallows for raping and killing their sister six years later.

Suddenly, the siblings-- aged 8 and 13 years-- found themselves on the streets of Agra. They were living along the roadside near Saiyan toll plaza on Agra-Gwalior highway.

On a rainy day of September last year, days after their father’s incarceration, a neighbour spotted the two boys, drenched and waiting for a truck to sell the trash they had collected the entire day. They used to handover the daily earnings to a woman who used to offer them food in its lieu. When TOI highlighted the plight of the brothers, they were rescued and sent to a shelter home about four months ago.

Now, a few months on, the two brothers were found to be living in separate government-run protection homes. The younger boy, who is eight years old, is currently living in Agra’s children shelter home while the elder, who is 13 years old, is in Firozabad. When contacted, the district administration said “their age differences have separated them.” But, officials said that efforts were on to house them together in a better shelter home.

Ritu Verma Indolia, district coordinator of ‘Childline Agra’, an NGO, said, “The younger one misses his brother and has expressed his wish to meet him.” A similar wish was reiterated by the elder brother.

Zafar Alam, a member of child welfare committee (CWC) of Firozabad, said, “The boy wants to meet his younger brother. We are exploring a way to help them. If necessary, we will write to district child protection unit to arrange a meeting of the two kids.”

According to Juvenile Justice Act, there should be separate shelter homes for children between 0 and 10 years, and for those above the age of 10. In Agra region, all rescued children below 10 years are kept in Shahganj child protection unit, while those above 10 years are sent to Firozabad.

But, CWC Agra’s member Gopal Sharma told TOI that a plan was ready to shift the two brothers to a better shelter home, together. However, there was a glitch or two.

“We were ready to transfer the brothers to an orphanage in Varanasi for a better life, as the proposal sent to us was suitable. But, we didn’t receive the social investigation report (SIR) of one of the brothers on time by district probation officer (DPO) of Agra and CWC Firozabad. Two days ago, the CWC of the entire state was also dissolved. But, I’m sure the next CWC will clear the hurdle.”

But, when contacted, DPO of Agra, Luvkush Bhargav denied receiving any request.

“CWC Agra didn’t give any request for the social investigation report. However, since the CWC is now dissolved, we are waiting for district magistrate of Agra to designate new executive magistrate, so that the boys’ case could be presented to them and they could be transferred to the orphanage for a better life,” Bhargav said.

Taking cognizance of the duo’s condition, a TOI reader, managing director of a private consulting firm in Gurugram, Anjali Misra along with a private orphanage ‘SOS Childline’ approached CWC Agra to shift the boys to a better shelter and offered to provide education and other help till the two brothers become self-reliant to take care of themselves.

Speaking to TOI, Anjali Misra said, “Even after several efforts to get the boys together, nothing concrete has been done by CWC Agra or by the DPO, and the two siblings continue to live 50-km apart. Those boys lost their younger sister, there mother is missing for more than seven-years and the father is set for gallows. Yet the authorities remain heartless.”

“After reading TOI report published on September 28 last year, I offered all help to DPO of Agra to help the children. I therefore contacted private orphanage in Varanasi, where several rescued children have achieved a good life after been funded by individuals,” said Misra.

88,['7/02/2020'],‘High pension budget hurdle to military modernisation’,"This story is from February 7, 2020

Representative image

PUNE: An increasing pension budget has become a major hurdle to the implementation of the military’s modernization plans, said former senior officers of the Armed Forces during a panel discussion on Friday.

The discussion on the topic, ‘Analysis of Defence Budget 2020: Can Jointness Minimize The Shortfall?’, was organized by the Centre for Advanced Strategic Studies and the National Academy of Defence Finance Management.

The former officers pointed out that the government was spending more on pension than modernization of the forces. They further said jointmanship among the forces, indigenization and preventing duplication of roles can help reduce expenditure.

“If you want to improve modernization of the Armed Forces, reducing revenue budget is necessary to increase capital budget,” said Major General Nitin Gadkari (retired), who served in the Regiment of Artillery . “One of the key components of this is manpower, which forms 60% of the total budget. In the past few decades, the pension budget has grown faster than the modernization budget. In 1950, about 3.80 lakh personnel were drawing pension. The number has now grown to 26 lakh. If this continues, the pension expenditure will be eight times more than what it was in the 1970s,” Gadkari added.

Air Marshal S S Soman (retired), former Air Officer Commanding in Chief of the Western Air Command, said modernization parameters were inversely proportional to human resources parameters, such as pensions and salaries. “The pension budget has been growing at a rate of 14%. For the first time, the pension bill of the Army is more than the salary bill. Since pension and revenue bills are on the rise, the Armed Forces get only 8% budgetary allocation for modernization. This has severely affected the military’s acquisition plans,” Soman said.

Soman said jointness, or synergy of the forces, would minimize the shortfall in the defence budget. “Every effort to promote it would be worthwhile, particularly when defence budgets are marred by fiscal constraints. The appointment of the Chief of Defence Staff (CDS) was a positive step and we are looking forward to effective synergy in combat arms and operations among the services,” he said.

Rear Admiral Satish Godbole (retired) said indigenisation was necessary to reduce procurement cost by 3-4 times. “Duplication of work needs to be eliminated. For example, the Indian Coast Guard was carved out of the Navy. Now, it has its own infrastructure, ships, etc. If the Coast Guard is merged with the Navy, we can use the (extra) funds to build ships and submarines,” Godbole said.

TRICHY: The proposal to establish a bus stand on the Panchakarai Kollidam Flood Bank Road at Srirangam under the smart cities mission is likely to be delayed further as the site chosen for the project falls outside the key focus area of the smart cities mission. Meanwhile, Trichy City Corporation has launched work on a parking lot for corporation vehicles at the same site, hinting at further delay in materializing the bus stand project or dropping the proposal.

As the civic body’s efforts to establish a bus stand at Srirangam since 2013 has failed to yield a result, the corporation revived it under the smart cities programme in July 2019. A detailed project report (DPR) was also prepared after identifying the 6.2-acre land of the local body on Panchakarai Kollidam Flood Bank Road near Yatri Nivas. The site is familiar to the local people as the previous proposal for a bus stand at the same site was shelved after finding out that the location is low-lying and flood-prone. While the residents of Srirangam were waiting for a solution through smart cities mission, the proposal seems to have hit a roadblock again. Sources said that the site chosen for the bus stand falls outside the Area Based Development (ABD) zone, the core focus area of smart cities mission. This might have forced the smart cities mission to desist from giving approvals for the proposal as there is a cap in sanctioning high-budget projects outside the ABD zone.

""We have approached the committees of the smart city mission seeking inclusion of the bus stand proposal under the mission’s ambit, and the discussion is under way,"" a corporation official said. However, indicating a significant delay in the proposal, the corporation has launched work on a parking lot at the site.

90,['7/02/2020'],Thermal pulsation to treat dry eye syndrome in patients,"This story is from February 7, 2020

Pune: IT professional Rashid (32) had been complaining of terrible eye strain lately. The persistent stinging, burning and scratchy sensation in his eyes almost drove him to tender his resignation at a job that required him to be seated in front of a computer screen for long.

Despite undergoing conventional treatment, Rashid’s condition continued to deteriorate. The situation used to become worse when seated in an airplane or an air-conditioned room. He recalled that watching television at night and smoking added to his woes. Upon examination, he was diagnosed with blocked eyelid glands, a condition medically known as meibomian gland dysfunction.

Eye surgeons at a city hospital used a thermal pulsation technology to treat Rashid’s chronic dry eye condition by targeting the blocked meibomian glands, which secrete oils onto the surface of the eyes to keep them lubricated.

“Meibomian gland dysfunction (MGD) is a common but often neglected eye condition,” eye surgeon Aditya Kelkar said.

Kelkar, also the director of the National Institute of Ophthalmology (NIO), has treated over 200 patients with MGD using the latest thermal pulsation therapy over the last six months. “The therapy benefits most patients with dry eye syndrome. However, it does not work in a small subset of patients who have tear deficiency condition, or in those with missing meibomian glands,” he said.

The risk of MGD increases with age. People over the age of 40 have a significantly greater risk of developing it. “Heightened use of electronic devices has made even younger generation prone to it,” Kelkar said.

The conventional treatments of MGD comprise warm compresses and eyelid hygiene to unclog the glands. Antibiotics and anti-inflammatory agents are prescribed to improve the quality of the oil.

“Thermal pulsation treatment is a drug-free approach. It is the US Food and Drug Administration-approved procedure, designed to treat the root cause of evaporative dry eye, blocked or deteriorated meibomian glands. It combines heat with physical massage to liquefy and clear the obstructions that caused the symptoms,” Ahmedabad-based eye surgeon Ashish Nagpal said.

“Correction of other factors like limiting laptop use, screen time, frequent use of lubricating eye drops, regular blinking while using computers, removal of make-up before going to bed, helps in limiting the dryness in eyes,” eye surgeon Jai Kelkar said.

Representative image

VADODARA: A local court in Savli has rejected the anticipatory bail application of six persons accused of duping Manpasand Beverages Ltd (MBL).

The accused, who are associated with a private financial firm, were booked by the Bhadarva police last year for duping MBL of hundreds of crores by promising the company owners loans worth Rs 100 crore.

Police said the accused identified as Bharat Patel, Hardik Patel and Ajay Agrawal, all residents of Mumbai and Vishal Jariwala, a resident of Ahmedabad, Parashiva Bassapamurthy, a resident of Bangalore and Pavan Rathi of Vadodara, had approached MBL management and offered to give a loan of Rs 100 crores. MBL was in trouble last year when the goods and services tax (GST) officials raided the company’s premises over tax evasion.

MBL’s several directors had resigned from the company and even the banks refused to give them loans. The accused promised to give MBL a loan in lieu mortgaged the company’s properties worth Rs 600 to Rs 700 crores. MBL management said that it got loans of just Rs 12 crores.

It was also alleged that the accused kept their directors in MBL and relieved the employees from accounts and other departments.

While the accused promised to cooperate in investigations, the court observed that they didn’t turn up when the police sent them summons thrice last year. The court also considered the big amount of money involved in the cheating case and rejected the anticipatory bail application of the accused on Wednesday.

The GST officials had raided MBL premises last year and unveiled a racket of creating fake/dummy units for availing fraudulent credit and committing tax evasion of Rs 40 crores and involving turnover of Rs 300 crore. GST officials had said the investigation unearthed a network of more than 30 fake units located in various parts of the country which were used for committing fraud by availing illegal credit. MBL had registered a net loss Rs 206 crore for 2018-19.

PUNE: A man was arrested the second time on Thursday afternoon in Pimpri village after he escaped from police custody owing to a chaotic situation that his relatives created on Wednesday afternoon.

The Pimpri police have booked five persons, including family members of the thief, for helping him flee from Samarthnagar in Pimpri.

Nadim Gafoor Shaikh (19) of Pimpri was arrested by the Government Railway Police (GRP), Pune, on Sunday for stealing valuables from railway passengers. In order to search his house, the GRP officials had taken him to Samarthnagar.

According to the Pimpri police, when the GRP officials took him to Samarthnagar, his relatives gathered there. They started shouting and created a chaotic situation at the spot. Shaikh took advantage of the situation and ran away.

The GRP officials conducted a search and lodged a complaint against Shaikh and his relatives with the Pimpri police.

Shaikh ran out of luck when the Pimpri police received a tip-off on Thursday stating that he would be visiting the area again. A police team laid a trap at a PMPML bus stop and apprehended him when he alighted from the bus.

The police have booked Shaikh and his relatives under Section 353 (assault or criminal force to deter public servant from discharge of his duty) of the Indian Penal Code .

Representative image

CHENNAI: Almost a week after more than 50% BSNL employees made an exodus, availing themselves of the voluntary retirement scheme (VRS), subscribers have started feeling the pinch of poor services. While city residents are witnessing the impact on mobile services, those in suburbs are complaining about drop in broadband internet speed .

Sadagopan, a resident of Pattabiram on the western outskirts of the city, and a long-time subscriber of BSNL’s broadband facility, said he was forced to surrender the service. “Services have gone from bad to worse in the last one week. I have just surrendered my broadband connection and switched over to another service provider,” he said.

According to him, the exodus of employees that left the state-owned telecom provider services further dwindling, has resulted in virtual sabotaging of communication services. “We can see the impact at BSNL telephone exchanges and customer service centres, which are struggling due to acute shortage of workers. Suburbs in Tiruvallur district are the worst hit as several localities are dependent only on BSNL for broadband services since there was no alternative or competitors,” he said.

BSNL mobile phone subscribers in the southern suburbs of Guduvancherry, besides core parts of the city, said they are running from pillar to post in search of better signal. Another long-time BSNL subscriber, who has his office at Anna Nagar, said several customers are continuing with BSNL landline connections due to their affinity towards phone numbers. “I have been using this telephone number for the past three decades. The issue is there is poor response to attend to problems,” Sridharan said.

BSNL Chennai circle chief general manager Santhosham said necessary steps are being taken to attend complaints of customers. ""We are re-deploying the existing staff to all exchanges to ensure that none remain unmanned. Moreover, we are in the process of outsourcing certain technical works such as attending complaints at customer’s location,” he added.

96,['7/02/2020'],MSBSHSE serves notice to Jalgaon school,"This story is from February 7, 2020

Nashik: The Nashik division of Maharashtra State Board for Secondary and Higher Secondary Education (MSBSHSE) has served a show-cause notice to a school in Jalgaon for failing to furnish the complete list of teachers for evaluating HSC examination papers.

The school, situated at Pimpalgaon (Hare) in Jalgaon district, was issued the notice on Tuesday. “We have issued a show-cause notice to the school as it concealed the names of three teachers who are approved by the board for paper evaluation. Such acts are against the rules and regulations of the board and would lead to serious consequences for the school and teachers,” divisional secretary of the board (Nashik division) Nitin Upasani said.

The schools and junior colleges were asked to submit their panel details with the list of subject-wise teachers and moderators to the board for the current academic year.

“We had to do some investigation at our end when we found out that there are schools and junior colleges that do not declare correct number of teachers and moderators which leads to extra burden of papers for the listed teachers. To do away with such practices, we have decided to take strict actions if any institute or teacher is found guilty,” Upasani added.

As the number of students has increased by over 6,000 students this year, the board will require more teachers to evaluate the papers. If the correct list of approved teachers is not shared with the board, the listed teachers have to correct more papers which may delay the declaration of results.

The board has warned the schools and junior colleges of serious consequences for such lapses. It has also asked the schools and colleges to inform the board immediately if they come across any such case in their institute.

“It is a serious misconduct. Action might lead to stoppage of increment and spoiled service record of the teacher concerned,” Upasani said.

Mangaluru: With the completion of Pumpwell and Thokkottu flyovers, the fare at the Talapady toll booth will be hiked , said Shishu Mohan , project director, NHAI . The two flyovers—Thokkottu and Pumpwell—which took a long time to complete, were opened for traffic recently.

While Thokkottu flyover opened for traffic in June last year, Pumpwell flyover, which took almost a decade to be completed, was opened for traffic on January 31.

“So far toll fee is collected for the completed road stretch on the highway. The toll will be hiked as the two flyovers are completed and allowed for the use of commuters. The amount will be decided by the ministry of road transport and highways. NHAI will send a proposal for toll hike, and the same will be decided by the ministry,” he told TOI.

On being asked whether the toll hike is applicable to nearby toll booths such as Surathkal and Brahmarakootlu in Bantwal taluk, Shishu answered that it is only applicable for Talapady. He also added there are no current plans to construct flyovers at Nanthoor and KPT junction.

Currently, commuters travelling in undivided Dakshina Kannada pay toll at Brahmarakootlu, Talapady, Surathkal, Hejamady and Sastan. A new toll booth is planned at Shiroor.

The advocate argued that Jagan himself had called the injury minor and pointed out that Jagan was the head of the state and Srinivas nothing but a common man.

The prosecution strongly objected to the discharge petition and said that the evidence collected from the spot prove Srinivas as guilty.

100,['7/02/2020'],Boost for Guntur division as Centre allots funds for prime rail projects,"This story is from February 7, 2020

Amaravati: In what could be called a practical approach to the development of railway infrastructure and boost industrial development in the state, the Centre has alloted funds to strengthen the existing rail network under Guntur division.

Meanwhile, the railway board has added the doubling of Guntur-Bibi Nagar project to its list of priorities by listing it in the pink book, which registers projects to be taken up across the country. The projects listed in the pink book get automatic clearance from the finance ministry. The doubling of Guntur-Bibi Nagar would help both Guntur and Vijayawada divisions get more new trains as it will improve connectivity with Hyderabad and other metro cities. The railway board has granted permission for the final survey of the railway line and is likely to begin allocation of funds after getting the location survey report.

The 248-km long second line to connect Guntur with Hyderabad is expected to cost Rs 2,500 crore. Many of the trains running between Guntur and Hyderabad usually take nearly six-eight hours because it is a single-line track. Since many of the major cement plants are located near Nadikudi and Miryalaguda stations in Guntur division, freight movement also gets affected due to the single-line track.

The double lining of Guntur-Bibi Nagar would help the entire South Central Railway (SCR) reap rich dividends by operating more trains to facilitate the freight movement. This is also expected to help upland areas of Guntur and Krishna districts get more industries. In another significant move, the finance ministry spared nearly Rs 1,198 crore for ongoing Nadikudi-Srikalahasthi new railway project. The 308-km long project is expected to cost around Rs 3,500 crore.

The Nadikudi-Srikalahasthi project is already in the Prime Minister’s priority projects list and has been getting funds from the Centre. The first phase of the project between New Piduguralla and Savalyapuram stations in Guntur districts is nearing completion and expected to begin operating by March. Fresh allocation of budget will put the second phase of works, which passes through the most under-developed region of Prakasam and Nellore districts, on the fast track.

Meanwhile, Centre seems to have junked the dream Amaravati rail line project. Although, the railway board had given its green signal to the first-phase of the rail project about two years ago, the then TDP government had failed to put it on fast track that has helped the Centre to put it on the backburner.

AGRA: Runkuta gram panchayat will soon get the status of a nagar panchayat. Following the proposal of minister of state Chaudhary Udaybhan Singh , the district administration has sent a report to the state government for approval.

A village of Kiraoli sub-division, Runkuta is located adjacent to the National Highway-2. It is around 12 kilometres from the city and has a population of around 30,000.

After getting elected as an MLA from Fatehpur Sikri assembly constituency, Chaudhary Udaybhan Singh started working on a plan to get nagar panchayat status for Runkuta.

Sub-divisional magistrate of Kiraoli Mahesh Prakash Gupta said, “A report has been sent to the urban development ministry of the state government to provide the status of nagar panchayat to Runkuta. A proposal was sent by the local MLA.”

Gram Pradhan of Runkuta Maya Devi said, “Local residents have been demanding for a nagar panchayat status to Runkuta since past several years. The area will see rapid development after the final approval from the state government.”

Singh said, “Runkuta fulfills all the conditions to get the status of a nagar panchayat. Soon, the state government will provide the final approval in this regard. The area will see rapid development related to water supply, sewer and road infrastructure.”

In the report sent to the state government, district administration has mentioned that out of around 30,000 local residents, only 500 to 600 people are dependent on agriculture. Runkuta has 10 residential colonies, eight branches of banks, post offices, markets, four private hospitals etc.

According to sources, the status of nagar panchayat to Runkuta will be beneficial for the Soor Sarovar Bird Sanctuary located nearby. Last week, state forest minister Dara Singh Chauhan declared that Soor Sarovar Bird Sanctuary will be developed as an eco-tourism destination. In this regard, the state government is likely to make announcement in the state budget.

104,['7/02/2020'],Long-stay home for people who overcome mental problems,"This story is from February 7, 2020

Indore: In a bid to rehabilitate people with mental problems, district administration is setting up a long-stay home for patients, who are discharged from hospital. The step has been taken as per guideline set by Supreme Court.

In Madhya Pradesh, Indore and Gwalior have government-run mental hospitals and provide halfway home facility but don’t have any provision to provide shelters to the patients, who have been cured but their family members have refused to accept them. The facility of long-stay home being set up in both cities is meant to provide shelter, food, clothes and treatment, if required any, who have been cured two years ago.

“In OPD, we examine 250-300 patients daily while there are around 900 admissions in the hospital in a year. We have recorded almost 100 per cent discharge of male patients after they are cured while for female patients, this percentage is around 70-80, which is very painful as society doesn’t want to accept them,” superintendent and professor Dr Ramgulam Razdan told TOI.

He added that the hospital has a 30-bed halfway home but setting up of long-stay home will be for people, who are cured or need long term medication.

“It will be a 50-bed long-stay home for people mostly destitute or whose family members have denied accepting them. There is a provision to seek legal help for them to protect their rights including their claim in family property. But during this, they will be provided shelter in new facility,” zila panchayat CEO Neha Meena told TOI.

To rehabilitate cured persons, state social justice department has formed a district-level committee to be headed by district collector as chairman. At the centre, records of inmates will be maintained and they will be provided treatment and medication if required, along with food, clothes and different means of entertainment.

Pune: A think tank which works on reversing the impact of climate change, Pune Climate Collective (CLiC), has outlined goals to ensure that the city becomes carbon neutral over the next ten years.

A document — Making Pune Metropolitan Region Carbon Neutral by 2030 — released by CLiC recently has outlined the ways to ensure maximum carbon sequestration in the Pune Metropolitan Regional Development Authority (PMRDA) region.

Aditi Kale, a coordinator at the CLiC, said, “We have been preparing this report for the last one year. We came out with the document to make the PMRDA region carbon neutral by 2030”.

Whatever you’re emitting is compensated by the sequestration, that is, storage or the carbon sinks, Kale said. “Right now, about 97% of the emissions are not getting sequestered”, she said.

The document proposed a two-way action plan. “We would focus on emission reduction and carbon sequestration. We need to ensure proper emission reduction with a 70% cut on emissions. Our sequestration capacity is thrice of what it is right now. So, with this we could reduce the emission gap significantly”, she said.

10th edition of Thamirabarani Waterbird Court observed

MADURAI: Wildlife enthusiasts and organisers of the 10th edition of Thamirabarani Waterbird Court (TWC) observed that many irrigation tanks have been desilted and maintained to collect more water. But they expressed concerned over the poor maintenance of the waterbodies by the villagers and residents around them.

They said that the villagers, who are the primary stakeholders of the waterbodies, are unaware of the water resources. They observed that the tanks are exploited by dumping loads of garbage. The survey stated that a lot of used liquor bottles and plastic were found in nearly 90% of the tanks that were surveyed.

There is a sharp decline in the number of birds at Kadambakulam that had attracted more than 10,000 water birds – mostly ducks – this year as the tank was encroached and polluted by invasive species such as Ipomea Carnea and Eichhornia. They killed native species that ducks feed on and also shrunk the surface water needed for the birds.

They lamented over waterbodies turning into open bars by boozers who throw bottles and waste in and around the tank. Another issue of concern was hunting the winged visitors using coracle and dogs.

Urging the government and district administrations to take strong action against such anti-social elements, they pressed for local community monitoring to save the habitats. They said awareness programmes should be conducted for the local community for the conservation of tanks and birds.

Emphasising the need for a proper management plan to develop irrigation tanks by involving line departments, farmer groups and experts in the field of wetland ecology, they also emphasised on biodiversity monitoring by forming local committees in select wetlands that are critical for biodiversity.

108,['7/02/2020'],"Parking fee row: Traders turn docs to ‘treat’ to ‘corrupt’ AMC, mayor","This story is from February 7, 2020

Agra: Traders of Sanjay Place, who have been protesting for the past 24 days against parking fee imposed by Agra Municipal Corporation (AMC) in the market, turned “doctors” to attend to the “ailing mayor Naveen Jain and the civic body” on Thursday.

As a mark of protest, the traders set up a symbolic ICU at the dharna spot in the parking space. Two traders lay down on the beds as “patients” named after mayor Jain and AMC”. A team of traders playing the role of “untrained doctors with over 10 years of experience” treated “the patients”. The “doctors” claimed that “the patients” were in a bad condition as they had consumed “garbage and sewage”.

As “lucky charm”, brand new shoes were hung on the bed of both “patients” to keep evil spirits away.

Vice-president of Sanjay Place welfare association Brijendra Baghel said, “The AMC is seriously affected by the disease of corruption. They are exploiting traders by illegally charging a parking fee. Only public awareness can bring any relief.”

Since January 14, traders of Sanjay Place have been sitting on an indefinite dharna against imposition of parking fee at 38 places in the market premises by AMC. They claimed it violates norms as they had already paid a one-time parking fee at the time of purchasing the property.

Secretary of Sanjay Place Market Association Hiren Agarwal said, “AMC has flouted norms as traders of the market have already paid a fee for parking space at the time of purchasing property. The dictatorship of AMC administration will not be tolerated at any cost. The protest will continue till the fee is rolled back.”

The dispute over parking fees between Sanjay Place traders and AMC is sub judice. Traders want AMC to cancel parking contracts till the court delivers its verdict in the matter.

Association's treasurer Vinay Mittal alleged, “Despite the ongoing case at the sessions court, AMC administration has issued parking contracts for three years to people associated with BJP. AMC officials also get a share of the parking fee illegally collected at the market. We will not withdraw our protest till the AMC rolls back its decision.”

VADODARA: The Vadodara Municipal Corporation (VMC) is looking to amend the conditions for allocation of dairy parlous to Gujarat Cooperative Milk Marketing Federation (VMC). The VMC had put up condition that GCMMF would maintain the gardens where it had the parlours including the Sayajibaug, but VMC wants to make an exception for Sayajibaug after a missive from GCMMF in this regard.

After a major row regarding the parlours located in eight gardens that had also reached the Gujarat high court, the VMC had last year agreed to allocate the eight parlours to GCMMF on the condition of the gardens’ maintenance. GCMMF wrote to the VMC in October expressing inability to maintain the Sayajibaug better known as Kamatibaug.

The situation is understandable given the size of the garden and the expenses involved. The VMC has now come up with a proposal that the maintenance of Sayajibaug should not be included in the conditions for allocation of booths in the gardens to GCMMF. The standing committee of the civic body will take a decision in this regard in its meeting on Friday.

Pune: The Pune Mahanagar Parivahan Mahamandal Limited (PMPML) is mulling stricter punishments like suspension or dismissal from service for bus drivers speaking on phones while driving.

The PMPML officials are also contemplating reviving an old system which involved giving rewards to people for clicking photographs of PMPML drivers speaking on cellphones while driving. Sources said the monetary reward system was abolished because there were only a certain set of people providing photographs of drivers to the PMPML.

Recently, nine drivers were fined Rs 1,000 each. One of them caught repeating the offence for the second time, was slapped with a penalty of Rs 2,000. The authorities recently fined five drivers Rs 1,000 each for using cellphones while they were at the wheel. “The punishment for drivers needs to be made stricter. They may be suspended for an indefinite period or dismissed if found violating the same rule repeatedly,” an official told TOI.

Vijayawada/Tirupati: Moving swiftly to scotch reports that Kia Motors India was negotiating with the Tamil Nadu government to move its car-assembly unit in Anantapur district to the neighbouring state, the state government on Thursday said the Korean carmaker is planning to ramp up its production capacity in the state from 2 lakh units per annum to 3 lakh units by the end of this year.

Both the AP government and Kia Motors dubbed media reports that the carmaker was negotiating with the Tamil Nadu government to relocate its unit as “false”, “unfounded” and “untrue”.

In a separate press statement, Rajat Bhargava, special chief secretary (industries & infrastructure), AP government, dismissed the report as baseless. “The government of AP condemns the false report. This is a completely baseless story as Kia Motors and Andhra Pradesh are continuing their strong partnership with Kia planning to ramp up their production capacity in the state from 2 lakh units per annum to 3 lakh units by end of this year or earlier,” Bhargava said.

Bhargava added that the principal secretary to industries department of Tamil Nadu has conveyed that they are not in talks with Kia Motors and that there were no discussions between the two parties in this regard.

A Kia Motors India spokesperson too dismissed the “unfounded and untrue” report. “Kia has a long-term commitment to India market. We have made an investment of $1.1 billion for our state-of-the-art manufacturing facility at Anantapur. We do not have any plans to shift our production facility from the current location and we are on the right track to utilize the full capacity of the facility. We will continue to offer world-class, made-in-Anantapur vehicles and innovative mobility experience to our valuable customers in India,” he said in a statement.

The AP government also refuted media reports that suggested Kia Motors was planning to drive out due to the July 2019 law brought in by the state to set aside 75% of private sector jobs in AP for locals. “Reports of the state government not fulfilling the commitment in terms of industrial incentives and problems on account of the state government’s 75% reservation for locals in jobs etc are not true. The government is committed to fulfil all the obligations extended to Kia Motors, whether it is with respect to incentives,” Industries minister Mekapati Goutham Reddy said.

Finance minister Buggana Rajendranath and YSRC parliamentary party leader V Vijaysai Reddy too strongly condemned the report, saying the state government enjoys excellent relations with Kia Motors. The issue reached the corridors of Parliament when TDP MP K Rammohan Naidu raised it in the Lok Sabha, seeking the Centre’s interference to save the state’s resources. YSRC MP Peddireddy Mithun Reddy, refuted the charge and asserted the plant would remain in AP.

Police investigate the crime scene on Thursday

ALLAHABAD: A 35-year-old widow and her three minor daughters were found dead at their Aswa Daudpur village home in trans-Ganga area, 40km from the district headquarters, on Thursday morning.

While circumstantial evidence and preliminary investigation indicate that Manju Devi, a bidi worker, committed suicide with her children, Priya (8), Annu (6) and Ritika (4), police are waiting for autopsy reports to confirm the same.

Parents of the woman have accused her two brothers-in-law, Mahesh and Dinesh, of harassing her since her husband Ramesh Bharatiya passed away four years ago. Following claims of abetment and even murder, police have detained Mahesh and Manju’s father-in-law Shri Nath for questioning.

SSP Satyarth Anirudh Pankaj, who inspected the scene along with SP (trans-Ganga), however, said there were no external marks of injury on the bodies and all household items were in place, suggesting no forced entry.

Neighbours told police that Manju and her children were last seen at a dinner at a local villager’s home on Wednesday. “When the kids did not come out to play this morning, neighbours became curious. Some peeped through a window and found the girls lying unresponsive on two separate cots. They broke in and found Manju on the floor, lifeless too,” the SSP said.

Demanding immediate action, family members blocked vehicles when police tried to take the bodies away for postmortem examination. They relented after senior officers intervened and promised thorough investigations.

SSP Pankaj said forensic experts were working on the case and both abetment to suicide and murder angles would be probed.

Nashik: The number of convicts enrolling for studying different courses offered by Nashik-based Yashwantrao Chavan Maharashtra Open University ( YCMOU ) has gone down by around 50%.

In the academic year 2018-19, as many as 1,803 convicts from across seven central jails in the state had took admission in various undergraduate courses at YCMOU. However, for the ongoing academic session, the total number is 998.

“The enrolment of convicts to pursue any educational course largely depends on jail authorities as they have to encourage the prisoners to study and get educated during their stay in the jail,” an official from the university told TOI.

Teaching in jails was started in the year 2008-09 and since then YCMOU has made seven jails across the state as its study centres. Till now, several certificate and undergraduate courses offered by the university have been completed by the convicts.

Other than Nashik Road Central Jail , central prisons in Amravati, Kolhapur, Nagpur, Thane and district prisons in Dhule and Aurangabad are the study centres of YCMOU.

“While most of the convicts only join the undergraduate courses, seven convicts in Nagpur jail are pursuing Masters of Arts,” the varsity official said, adding 23 convicts from Thane have opted for English being their medium of learning as English, while rest have opted for Marathi-medium.

E Vayunandan, vice-chancellor of YCMOU, said “It was a novel move by the university that has benefited thousands of convicts who wanted to educate themselves. It is a positive move that helps them in coming out of their gloomy past and take a leap in the future.”

He added, “Being an open varsity, the convicts receive the study material in jail. If someone requires help, other educated convicts help them in understanding the concepts. The examination is conducted in the jail itself and the answer sheets are sent to the varsity for correction.”

Pramod Wagh, superintendent of Nashik Road central jail, said, “Last year 59 convicts showed interest in studying from the YCMOU whereas 65 convicts enrolled for the undergraduate courses in 2019-20. For 2020-21, the admissions are still on and around 50 convicts have taken admission.”

Since all convicts are not eligible for an under-graduate course, the varsity started a six-month preparatory course for them. The course teaches basic subjects to the convicts and after passing that course, they can join any undergraduate course from the varsity.

Pune: The transporter’s body has approached municipal commissioner Shekhar Gaikwad regarding a dedicated space to park buses and trucks. The civic chief had listed “improvement in city’s transport” among his top priorities.

The transporters’ body recently submitted a memorandum to Gaikwad to allot land for parking of larger commercial vehicles to avoid roadside parking that may create a nuisance for road users.

As per estimates, on a daily basis over 800 buses travel through the city, including private luxury buses and buses hired by citizens or industries. A similar numbers of trucks enter the city with goods and food items. The transporters’ body has pointed out that the city lacked dedicated truck or bus terminus.

“We have urged the civic chief to organize a meeting with the transporters at the earliest to discuss the issues. We will have a positive approach and we are ready to extend the required support to the civic administration,” said Baba Shinde, leader of the transporters’ body.

Shinde added that issues pertaining to provision of truck and bus terminus have been raised over the years on various platforms but transporters still await concrete solutions. “Since the new civic chief has expressed willingness to work on solutions to improve the city’s traffic, we are hoping for a breakthrough,” he added.

The proposal to allot land of octroi posts and vacant plots for buses and trucks is already under consideration. The transporters’ body has said that they were ready to utilize the spaces after payment of due charges. The civic administration must give recommendations to develop the plots that are reserved as parking spaces for trucks.

The transporters’ body have said that they would prefer parking bays located on the outskirts of the city. This will avoid entry of bigger vehicles on the city roads. The transporters also want at least one parking bay in every direction of the city or near major roads leading out of the city.

Representative image.

INDORE: In a first for the state, a team of doctors of Apollo Hospital have performed Lithotripsy — a shock wave therapy used for breaking down kidney stones — to clear the calcified blockage from the arteries of a senior citizen in the city.

A team comprising interventional cardiologists Dr K Roshan Rao and Dr Sarita Rao along with Dr Shirish Agarwal and Dr Vikas Gupta performed rotashock surgery using shock wave lithoplasty on a 75-year-old man.

Dr K Roshan Rao said that the man had suffered an acute heart attack a couple of days back and his left side arteries had deposition of very hard calcium chunks. In this situation, the conventional balloons failed even at higher pressure, he said.

The team, after explaining the patient ’s situation to his family members, decided to perform lithoplasty. “We used a combination of ballooning with intravascular lithotripsy to break down the calcium deposition inside and around the arteries for clearing blockages, he said.

Dr Sarita Rao said that using a console machine generating acoustic sonic waves at very low pressure ranging between four and six atmospheric pressure, a patient can be given eight cycles of ten second-shock each for breaking and clearing the blockage in the arteries. The waves are proved to impact according to the rigidity of the hard surface hence lowering the risk, she said.

When asked about the advantage of the new console technology over earlier ones used for angioplasty, she said, “This technology of clearing blockages in the artery will reduce risks involved in angioplasty including perforation and dissection, risking patient’s life.”

Angioplasty through this technique is quicker than the traditional one. This technique takes around half an hour for the entire process in comparison to four hours in traditional ones, she said.

This technique will prove to be a major help to elderly people, people with diabetes and those who don’t want bypass surgery or for those on whom it couldn’t be performed, she said.

Rs 4984 crore has been assigned for the Manmad- Indore railway line

NASHIK: The central government has allocated Rs 5 ,362 crore for Bhusawal division of the Central Railway (CR) in the Union Budget specifically for construction of new lines.

The bulk of the money (Rs 4,984 crore) has been assigned for the newly-proposed Manmad-Indore railway line project, the ground breaking ceremony for which carried out last year by Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The Manmad-Indore railway track project is around of 368-km-long and the work will be carried out in one go.

“This is the biggest work that has been sanctioned for the division so far. Funds allocated for Manmad-Indore track is on the lines of Extra Budgetary Resources (Partnerships), indicating that the work can be taken up with investment from states and even others,” a senior official from Bhusawal division said.

The new track will cut down the traveling distance to New Delhi by more than 150-km and benefit the future plans of the railways of running high speed trains between Mumbai and Delhi.

As of now the railways favour the western route for Delhi and many trains coming from South are also diverted from the Western route which is shorter than the current Central route between Mumbai and Delhi.

The 265-km Pune-Nashik route, however, has seen no allocation of funds in the budget. But construction of 56-km line between Dhule and Nardana has got allocation of Rs 1 crore. Apart from this, the budget has also proposed Rs 262 crore for construction of third lines at four different locations.

The works include 24-km Jalgaon-Bhusawal track (Rs 10 crore), 247-km track between Daund and Manmad (Rs 42 crore), 160–km Manmad-Jalgaon track (Rs 200 crore) and 124-km Igatpur-Manmad track (Rs 10 crore). The 67-km Kasara-Kalyan track has also been allocated Rs 55 crore.

The budgetary provision of Rs 50 crore for the fourth track between Jalgaon and Bhusawal (24 km) has also been made, the railway sources said.

Rs 10 crore has been allotted for setting up a workshop for overhauling and repairing of wheels at Traction Machine Workshop. The budget has also allocated Rs 63 lakh for construction of road over bridge (ROB) between Nashik Road and Deolali.

ALLAHABAD: A 35-year-old woman was arrested on charges of strangling her six-year-old step son to death in Pipri area of Kaushambi district on Thursday.

The arrested woman was identified as Minta Devi, wife of Chandan Pasi and resident of Giriya Khalsa village. Additional SP (Kaushambi) Ashok Kumar said, “The matter came to light when the body of a six-year-old boy, Arun Kumar, was found inside his home in Giriya village on Tuesday night. A case under section 302 of the IPC was registered at Pipri police station.”

“On Wednesday, the postmortem report of the minor revealed strangulation as the cause of death,” the SP said. “When police rigorously interrogated Minta, she confessed to have killed the minor boy out of jealousy,” he added.

Police informed that Minta had left her first husband—with whom she had two kids—six years ago and had later married another man named Chandan Pasi.

Even after four years into the marriage, she had no child with Chandan. Arun was Chandan’s only child from his first wife who died around four years ago.

Irked over not having a child with Chandan for the past four years, Minta hatched a conspiracy to kill Arun out of jealousy.

PIMPRI CHINCHWAD: The defence ministry has extended the term of elected members of 55 cantonment boards, including Pune, Khadki and Dehu Road, across the country by six months.

The ministry issued an order on Wednesday extending the tenure of the boards. The cantonment boards of Deolali , Ahmednagar, Aurangabad and Kamptee in the state also got an extension.

The elections of these cantonment boards were held in January 2015 and they came into existence on February 10, 2015. Their five-year tenure would end on February 10, but fresh elections have not been conducted till now to replace the elected members of the boards.

Resultantly, the defence ministry issued an order on Wednesday to extend the tenure of the cantonment boards by six months.

The order from the defence ministry stated that the central government exercised the power vested in it under the provision to sub-section (1) of Section 14 of the Cantonments Act, 2006, and extended the term of office of all the elected members of the 55 cantonment boards up to a period of six months or till the date of constitution of the board, whichever was earlier.

Suresh Kamble, member and former vice-president of the Khadki Cantonment Board (KCB), said, “The process of reserving wards for Scheduled Castes (SC), Scheduled Tribes (ST) and women could not be completed on time.”

He said, “Also, the election code of conduct for cantonment elections has to come into force 45 days before the polls are held.”

Pramod Singh, the chief executive officer of the KCB, and R Haritwal, the chief executive member of the Dehu Road Cantonment Board (DCB), could not be contacted despite repeated attempts to reach them.

Former vice-president of KCB Kamble said a similar extension was granted to the cantonment boards in May 2013.

“The five-year tenure of 2008-13 of the cantonment boards had ended in May 2013. So, the defence ministry had given two six-month extensions to the cantonment boards then,” said Kamble.

126,['7/02/2020'],NIA cites SC and HC rulings for Elgar case proceedings shift,"This story is from February 7, 2020

PUNE: The National Investigation Agency on Thursday relied on two superior court judgments to push its case for transfer of the Elgar Parishad case records, seized properties and proceedings from the UAPA court in the city to the NIA court in Mumbai.

Defence lawyers as well as one of the arrested activists, Surendra Gadling , opposed the plea, arguing that the National Investigation Agency (NIA) ought to have moved the Bombay high court as the Pune court had no competence/jurisdiction to entertain the plea for transfer of the case proceedings from one district to another.

Special UAPA judge S R Navander posted the matter for next hearing on Friday morning after district government pleader Ujjwala Pawar sought time to study the citations put forth by the NIA and the defence in support of their respective submissions.

NIA’s lawyer Namdev Taralgatti referred to Supreme Court’s 2017 judgment in CBI vs Prakashan C case and submitted, the probe agency was legally entitled to take over the investigation. He referred to a 2013 Kerala high court ruling, which held that re-registration of FIR and renumbering of case did not amount to a second FIR but was merely an administrative exercise.

Taralgatti read out various sections under the NIA Act and pointed out that the national agency had taken over further probe, an FIR had been re-registered and submitted to the Mumbai court and the NIA’s chargesheet, in future, would be filed in the Mumbai court. As such, it was imperative that the case records, seized properties and proceedings be moved to the Mumbai court, he said.

Defence lawyer Siddharth Patil argued the home ministry’s January 24 order only referred to transfer of investigation and made no mention about transfer of the case proceedings. The NIA’s plea was not maintainable as only the high court had the power to transfer case proceedings from one district to another, he said. Even the cases relied on by the NIA involved matters before the high court, he added.

Gadling argued there was no provision in the Code of Criminal Procedure entitling the NIA to make the instant plea as it ought to have moved the high court. He referred to a Bombay high court ruling that mere notification transferring investigation did not bring the NIA Act into play unless the state physically handed over the case records to the agency. He said the high court was to hear on February 10 a plea by the accused challenging the very proceeding before the Pune court as illegal. As such, judicial propriety called for the Pune court to desist from entertaining the NIA plea, he added.

Lawyer Shahid Akhtar argued the NIA plea was bereft of any specific provision to justify transfer considering that the Pune police had already filed chargesheets. A further investigation was subject to the investigating officer getting new material and a re-investigation could only be ordered by the superior court, he said.

Lawyer Rohan Nahar submitted that the NIA had not come to the Pune court with clean hands as its plea suffered from casual prayers to “send” case records and the cause title referred to “state represented by NIA” without clarifying what it meant by the word “state”.

Later, prosecutor Pawar told the court she would make her submissions on Friday.

Vijayawada: A 65-year-old man allegedly raped a 10-year-old girl in Kalidindi mandal of Krishna district on Wednesday. The incident, however, came to light on Thursday after a police complaint was lodged by the victim’s family.

The police identified the accused as Parasa Brahmaiah, 65, an agriculturist. Kalidindi police sub-inspector Janardhan said Brahmaiah lured the girl to his house while she was playing outside and raped her. The girl’s parents, who were searching for her, heard her screams and found Bramaiah sexually assaulting the child. The accused was thrashed by locals before being handed over to the police. Brahmaiah’s son allegedly aided him in the sexual assault on the girl, her parents alleged. The police, however, said Brahmaiah’s son was not present at the scene of crime. “As of now, the facts of the case are that the accused was handed over to us by the villagers after he was caught red-handed. We are investigating the case. We are also looking at other allegations like the involvement of Brahmaiah’s son,” Janardhan told TOI. The police have arrested Brahmaiah and registered a case under relevant sections of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (Pocso) Act, 2012.

The girl was sent to a local government hospital for medical examination. On Thursday, villagers protested near the police station demanding stringent action against the accused. The protesters dispersed after the police assured them the accused won’t be spared if guilty.

PUNE: The civic body’s special service for collection and disposal of construction waste has failed to find any takers so far.

The service, aimed at checking disposal of construction debris into river bed or vacant plots, was started in June last year. As a part of the initiative, the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) had set up ward-wise debris collection centres.

Civic officials, however, said they were yet to receive any requests for debris collection from citizens and real estate developers.

“We have been approaching those responsible for debris generation since the launch of the service. We continue to appeal to them to register with us so we can go ahead with the lifting process, but there has been no response so far,” said Dnyaneshwar Molak, head of the PMC’s solid waste management.

The civic body has also appealed to the citizens to provide details about the debris dumped in their areas or any other part of the city through a toll-free number (18002339595), following which it would be lifted by the civic body workers.

PUNE: Road safety activists from the city have opposed the idea of utilizing the Bus Rapid Transit System ( BRTS ) corridor for movement of two-wheelers citing safety concerns.

Pune Municipal Corporation commissioner Shekhar Gaikwad suggested allowing two-wheelers to use the BRTS lane while tabling the draft civic budget.

Gaikwad had said that dedicated lanes for two-wheelers would ensure faster movement and the BRTS corridors, which are only meant for buses, could be utilized for movement of two-wheelers, especially in congestion prone areas.

However, road safety activists have voiced their concerns about the move. Samaiirah from Safe Road Foundation said, “In Pune, vehicles do not follow the lane system. Buses and two-wheelers moving at high speed within the corridor make a recipe for disaster. We could see an increase in fatalities on roads if this is permitted. Either the corridors must be kept open for all vehicles or solely buses.”

Convener of another NGO, Pedestrians FIRST, Prashant Inamdar has written to the civic chief, city police and chairman and managing director of PMPML about the matter.

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The corporation is mulling prosecution measures against meat vendors and butchers operating unauthorizedly in the airport’s vicinity after Airfield environment management committee (AEMC) and district collector have called for stringent measures to check bird menace. A joint inspection by airport authorities, city corporation officials and police was held on February 1 to identify the places, where birds were found in large numbers. Open markets, meat vending spots and dump yards were spotted during the visit.

In the latest AEMC meeting held on February 3, the committee discussed the cost of bird strikes to civil aviation. It has been learnt that the committee held the view that since it was the civic body’s responsibility to prevent formation of dump yards and illegal meat stalls in the airport’s buffer zone, it could be held accountable for the loss incurred because of the bird hits . However, no final decision was made at the meeting.

During the past three months, two bird hits were reported, the meeting noted.

At a meeting held in October 2019, airport director who is also the convenor of AEMC, had informed that the bird strikes happening at Trivandrum airport was on the higher side and that in 2018, as many as 55 bird strikes were reported.

He pointed out that open meat/fish/chicken stalls must be curbed to avoid bird menace. Garbage accumulation was also reported in areas near Brahmos/Kochuveli railway station/Titanium and SN Nagar, Paruthikuzhy and Muttathara .

The civic body has identified four major meat vendors functioning near the airport’s vicinity. Meat shops operating without licences and those who dump waste near secured zone are likely to face prosecution measures.

The district collector has asked the corporation to identify the illegal meat vendors and issue notices following the meeting.

The corporation has been planning to constitute a special team comprising health officials to ensure that no dump yards are formed near the buffer zone around airport and to check functioning of illegal meat vendors. There has also been a demand to close the open fish market near Kochuveli which attracts birds. The corporation also deployed a team to clear piles of waste being dumped at Muttathara.

In the coming days, levelling will be done in the area to prevent further dumping of waste. With regards to the Kochuveli open market, the corporation plans to introduce a facility to manage waste at source. It was also found that some of its cleaning staff regularly dumped waste near airport which was recently cleared.

According to police, Mahavirsinh Jadeja (32) hanged himself to death from the ceiling of the room of his house in Bhadreshwer village. Jadeja’s brother Kuldeepsinh told the cops that Jadeja had taken the drastic step as he was tired of unemployment and financial crisis.

Seven hours after Jadeja’s death, his friend Jaideepsinh Jadeja (30), also hanged himself to death from the ceiling of his house in the same village.

“Jaideepsinh, who participated in the funeral procession and last rites of Jadeja, committed suicide after coming home on Wednesday evening. Before taking the drastic step, he wrote on his WhatsApp status: ‘Miss you jigara (best friend). Hue aavu chhoon. Tension na le' (I am also coming to join you, don’t take tension),” said S A Gadhvi, sub-inspector with Mundra marine police station.

135,['7/02/2020'],Maha home dept officials to study AP’s Disha Act,"This story is from February 7, 2020

Pune: State home minister Anil Deshmukh and key officials from the police department will visit Andhra Pradesh to study its Disha Act.

“I will be going with some key officials to Andhra Pradesh to study the Act,’’ Deshmukh told TOI recently.

The Andhra Pradesh Disha Act Criminal Law (AP Amendment) Act, 2019 was passed by the southern state on December 13 last year.

The new law mandates completion of investigation into cases of sexual offences within seven working days from the time of record and trial within 14 working days from the date of filing the chargesheet.

The appeal against the sentence passed under the new law has to be disposed of within six months. State home officials said the act would be studied so that it can be implemented in Maharashtra.

The government at present has 25 special and 27 fast track courts for expediting trials in such cases.

On tackling the rising number of cyber crimes, the state government had said of the proposed 47 special police stations for dealing with such cases, 43 have already started. About 164 posts in these stations would be filled up within two months.

The act calls for a national registry of sexual offenders made public and available to law enforcement agencies.

At present, the provision for punishing an offender in a rape case is a fixed jail term leading to life imprisonment or the death sentence.

The Disha Act 2019 has prescribed the death penalty for rape crimes where there is adequate conclusive evidence.

Provision is given by amending Section 376 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860. The act also presses for stringent punishment for sexual offences against children.

In the Andhra Pradesh Disha Act 2019, apart from rape, the government prescribes life imprisonment for other sexual offences against children.

Punishment for harassment of women through social media too has been included in the act.

Reducing the appeal time to three months for disposal of rape cases too has been included while the act also calls for constitution of special police teams and appointment of the special public prosecutor in special courts.

Sena functionary Eknath Shinde in December had said the Maharashtra government is serious about enacting a Disha like legislation, which was implemented by the Andhra Pradesh Government after the brutal rape and murder of a 26-year-old veterinarian in Hyderabad, to curb crimes against women in the state.

While replying to a calling attention motion by MLC Manisha Kayande in the legislative council on Wednesday, Shinde informed the upper house that such legislations were must to create an atmosphere where girls and women could move freely without any fear. According to him, such deterrent laws instill a sense of fear among criminals. Shiv Sena MLA Pratap Sarnaik had moved a private member bill in the assembly for a law like the Disha Act.

PUNE: Angry relatives of a 17-year-old boy vandalized Welfare Hospital at Ashirwad Chowk in Kondhwa Khurd on Wednesday night. They also attacked its staff, including the doctor who runs the hospital, for not issuing a death certificate. The teen had been admitted to the medical facility, but had not died there.The Kondhwa police on Thursday booked at least five people on charges of rioting and others of the Indian Penal Code and Maharashtra Medical Service Person and Medical Service Institution (Prevention of Violence and Damage or Loss to Property).Inspector Mahadeo Kumbhar from the Kondhwa police said, “Investigations show that the relatives abused the hospital staff and damaged the glass door by pelting stones.”Investigation officer assistant inspector Sandip Madhale said an FIR has been lodged and the relatives who damaged the hospital will be arrested.Sadique Khan, the doctor who runs the hospital, told TOI that the patient came to his hospital from another medical facility.In his FIR, Khan said, the relatives of the teen had admitted him in his hospital on Tuesday around 8.30pm as he was suffering from chest infection and a low platelet count.The doctor treating the patient on Wednesday around noon did not find any improvement in his condition and advised his parents to take him to another hospital for treatment. The parents got their son discharged at 6.30pm, the FIR read.According to the FIR, “Around 10.15pm, four to five men walked into the hospital and told me (Khan) that the boy had passed away because I did not provide him proper treatment and attacked me and my staff. They also abused us. They vandalised the main glass door, benches and threw the landline phones on the floor. They ran away after a crowd assembled inside the hospital.”Khan said the teen was suffering from breathing problems. “We advised his parents to shift him to another hospital because we were not equipped with medical facilities to treat his condition. We learned from the patient’s relatives that the boy was taken to two other hospitals after they took discharge from my hospital. The authorities there refused to admit him. His relatives then said the boy passed away on the way to Sassoon General Hospital.”Khan said the relatives told him that the parents took the body home as they did not want a postmortem. “The relatives came to me demanding a letter stating the details of his death. I refused on the grounds that he had been admitted to my hospital for a few hours and he had not died here.”The relatives then vandalised the hospital property on the ground and first floors, Khan said. A mob of over 200 men had assembled inside and outside the hospital, he added.“We have handed over the CCTV footage to the police. It shows the men responsible for vandalizing the hospital,” Khan said.Kumbhar said the patient’s body was handed over to his family after the autopsy at the Sassoon hospital and the report is awaited.The teen’s father told TOI that they were anxious about the boy’s health. “My son passed away because he was not given proper treatment at the Kondhwa hospital.

138,['7/02/2020'],There was delay on part of cops in reaching spot: Report,"This story is from February 7, 2020

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The Nedumangad DSP has reportedly filed an inquiry report before the superintendent of police (Rural District), stating that there were lapses on the part of officials of Kattakkada police station, who were on night duty on January 24 when 37-year-old Sangeeth Balan was allegedly attacked and killed by a group of men.

According to sources in the department, DSP Stuart Keeler submitted his inquiry report before rural SP B Ashok on Thursday stating that there was merit in the allegations levelled by the family of Sangeeth that there was delay on the part of the police in arriving at the spot, which gave ample time to the accused to carry out the attack and flee from the scene. The victim’s family had also alleged that the police worked in collusion with the mafia. It was based on these allegations, an inquiry was launched.

The rural SP is yet to confirm receiving the report. Hence, it is yet to be known what action the police officers in question will face.

The alleged murder took place during the early hours of January 24, while Sangeeth was trying to prevent the gang from digging up earth from his property. Though the police were alerted, they took more than an hour to reach the spot. By this time, the gang attacked Sangeeth by hitting him using an earthmover, critically injuring him. He eventually died of the injuries. The police reached the spot only after all the accused fled from the scene.

In the subsequent days, the police managed to arrest 10 accused. On Monday, the police have secured custody of seven of the accused persons from the court as part of further investigation. They are currently being taken to locations where they hid to evade arrest and also places where they have hidden the vehicles involved in the crime. They will be returned to judicial custody on Saturday.

140,['7/02/2020'],Conservationists raise alarm over fort panel removal,"This story is from February 7, 2020

PUNE: The cancellation of memberships of all non-governmental members of the five-year old Maharashtra Fort Conservation Committee by the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government could hamper fort restoration activities in the state, conservation experts said.

The committee, comprising several non-governmental members from the field of archaeology and heritage, including experts from the Deccan College , was constituted five years ago to oversee fort conservation in Maharashtra.

Officials from the state archaeology department said that the committee had hitherto proved to be a major support for expediting conservation measures in over 28 forts.

A state archaeology department official told TOI that the government was currently revamping the memberships of all such committees. “While the fort conservation committee still has its government official memberships intact, the non-governmental members have been removed. It is a policy decision by the new government to discard existing non-governmental members from such committees. But the committee will soon have new memberships and expertise from the field of heritage and archaeology,” he said.

He added that the committee had made substantial contribution towards bringing to light issues concerning the state’s forts in the last five years. “Conservation work worth Rs84crore was carried out in 28 forts. It would not have been possible without the committee,” he said.

A senior official from the state’s tourism and culture department told TOI that all government committees were going through the same process. Memberships of all non-governmental officials are being cancelled and new members are in the process of being instated.

“The official members are still a part of the committee, while the non-official members will be reinstated. We are receiving nominations and applications of such members. Once we arrive at a decision, the committee will be reconstituted soon,” he said.

Sachin Joshi, a researcher with archaeology department of Deccan College, who was also a member of the State Fort Conservation Committee, said, “The earlier committee had members from organisations working in the field of fort conservation. Their contribution was in the form of overseeing conservation works, surveying forts, preparing conservation guidelines, conducting meetings with the archaeology department to reviewing the qualitative aspects of works undertaken etc. With these members gone, there is currently no non-governmental expert to oversee the conservation work, which could affect the ongoing fort conservation efforts.”

Amar Adake, a fort conservation expert from Kolhapur and a former member of the committee, said, “The aim of forming the committee was to make proper fort documentation and conservation of masterplans. Hence it is necessary that the government reinstate new members into the committee as soon as possible. It was only because of the committee that close to 83 forts in the state are in the process of being granted protected status. Till the committee is not reconstituted, ongoing and new fort conservation work may be affected.”

143,['7/02/2020'],Consumers and solar industry players term grid support charges regressive,"This story is from February 7, 2020

Consumers vehemently opposed the grid support charges and tariff revision proposal at the public hearing organ... Read More

PUNE: Consumers and industry representatives on Thursday vehemently opposed the MSEDCL ’s proposal to levy Rs 4-8 in grid support charges on power generated from rooftop solar plants.

They termed the proposed charges as “unjust” and “regressive” during a public hearing organised by the Maharashtra Electricity Regulatory Commission (MERC). The hearing was held on the multi-year electricity tariff proposal of the Maharashtra State Electricity Distribution Company Limited, through which it aims to mop up Rs 60,313 crore between 2020 and 2025.

MSEDCL, in its petition submitted to MERC, had stated that solar rooftop load had increased from 20.44 MW in 2016-17 to 288.80 MW in 2018-19. The company said if paying consumers go out of its net, it would have to increase the tariff for remaining consumers.

The representatives of the solar power manufacturers’ association said the levy would adversely impact the Union government’s National Solar Mission as nobody would come forward to opt for the green energy option. There are 42 lakh agricultural pumps in Maharashtra that are powered by solar energy and even they will be hit by the levy, the association representatives said.

A representative of the Vasantdada Sugar Institute said they stopped the work for installing a 600 kilowatt-hour (Kwh) rooftop solar power plant because of the MSEDCL’s grid support charge proposal.

Consumers also came down heavily on the tariff revision proposal and termed it exorbitant. ND Patil of the Peasants and Workers Party alleged that the tariff was being increased to hide the inefficiencies of the power distribution company and its failure to check power thefts and transmission losses.

Shantanu Dixit of the Prayas Energy Group, which represents common consumers, said the distribution company was expected to propose tariff revision only to the extent of Rs 30,000 crore to make up for the gap in revenue and expenditure.

He suggested that the regulatory commission should allow tariff revision only to the extent of 35 paise per unit for the next five years. Although he supported the grid support charges for those using net metering, he said the charges should not exceed Re 1 per unit.

The industry representatives also objected to the proposed increase in fixed charges for small industries saying that it would affect the rural economy. They also pointed out that the government was taking steps to encourage small and medium industries, but the excessive power tariff would be counter-productive.

Representative Image

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Early detection and providing basic treatment are crucial in managing cancer, especially in countries like India, experts said at the annual conference of Indian Association of Cancer Research (ICAR) held in Kovalam on Thursday. However, they said that it should not lead to neglect of advanced research in the late-stage multi-modality treatment of the ‘killer disease’.

The conference, hosted by Rajiv Gandhi Centre for Biotechnology (RGCB), witnessed in-depth deliberations on the topic ‘cancer research investment should shift from late-stage treatment to early-stage detection’.

Dr R Sankaranarayanan, former director of Cancer Prevention, IARC, Lyons, France, said that early detection and treatment are crucial and the efficacy of this approach has been validated by data from different countries. “This strategy is much more cost-effective than late-stage multi-modality targeted treatment, especially for countries like India,” he asserted.

Noting that data on survival rates support this approach, he said, “Cancer is a journey where chances of recurrence are low if detected and managed in early stage, compared to the late-stage aggressive treatment”.

Underscoring need to give greater focus to cancer research, Dr Sankaranarayanan said that prices of drugs for cancer must come down. “The challenge is how we will put in place enablers and how to make basic treatment and follow-up accessible, by stepping up funding for detection and prevention programmes,” he said.

In another session, the participants observed that despite significant scientific and technological research being carried out by India’s excellent academic institutions, the benefits have not filtered down to the people due to lack of commercialization of the outcomes. “It is important to transfer the results of research to the market, so that they will reach the people that need them. Without that possibility, you will not get the returns of your work,” said Manu S Nair , vice-president, Technology Ventures, Oklahoma Medical Research Foundation . He was speaking on the topic ‘Love it or hate it: IP protection & limited monopoly in drug development/commercialization’ at the conference. The three-day conference will conclude on Friday.

PUNE: The National Film Archive of India (NFAI) is no stranger to discovering reels, considered lost, among its vast archives of films, but the recovery of two 16mm reels of the 1957 Kishore Kumar starrer Begunah, 60 years after the Bombay High Court ordered that all prints of the film be destroyed, has brought its own dilemma -- should a legally-tainted film be screened?

The film was banned by the high court after Paramount Pictures, the US, alleged it was a copy of their 1954 movie, Knock on Wood. Paramount won the case and the court ordered that all the prints of the film be destroyed.

The discovery of rare films is generally followed by a public screening but the legal history of Begunah has prompted the NFAI to play safe, including seeking legal advice from copyright law experts. It has written to the Bombay High Court, seeking the original judgment to find out the extent of the 1957 ruling.

“We have written to the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting, so that we can reach out to the Ministry of Law and Justice and find out about the future course of action before scheduling any screening. We have even informed Paramount Pictures about the development, and in our communication, we have mentioned the fair-use principle that film archives abide by, especially the non-commercial use,” Prakash Magdum, the NFAI director, told TOI.

“The discovery is simply a pure coincidence. The fact that prints of a film, ordered to be destroyed, have been discovered is simply incredible, even though the recovered reels have only about 60 minutes of footage. There are too many interesting things about the movie, such as Danny Kaye being one of Kishore Kumar’s idols. The rip-off was discovered by Paramount as Kaye was travelling to India at the time of Begunah’s release. Kaye alerted Paramount, following which they filed a suit,” Magdum said.

Apart from Kishore Kumar, the film starred actress Shakila. The music was by Shankar-Jaikishan . What movie buffs most remember about the film are the songs sung by three of the Mangeshkar sisters- Lata, Usha, Meena, as well as by Manna Dey, Mukesh, and Kishore Kumar.

Yet, he continues to be in the hospital as hotel and homestay owners in the city are reluctant to offer him a room despite the intervention of tourism department authorities.“As of now, the young man is not quarantined.

Even the government-run tourist home, Yatri Nivas, could not provide him accommodation as the staff there were terrified when they learned that he was from China.He said that barring some preliminary examinations, no detailed tests were done on the young man. “Such tests only need to be done if the subject shows symptoms of the infection. Since he did not show any such symptoms, no further tests were done,” the doctor said. The DMO added that the Chinese youth is freely roaming around in the hospital premises.“All he wishes is to spend a few days in the city and experience a nice time.

PUNE: Six months after he was evicted for defaulting on rent, a student tried to set his erstwhile landlord’s motorcycle on fire in revenge. His plan went up in smoke, however, when he was caught by alert residents.

The incident happened at Morya Colony in Kalewadi on Tuesday night. The Wakad police arrested the 19-year-old on Wednesday. Three of the youth’s accomplices, who had fled from the spot after the incident, were eventually tracked down and detained.

The police have invoked sections 427 (mischief) and 392 (robbery) of the Indian Penal Code .

Police said Mhaske is a student first-year of a college in Kalewadi. “His accomplices are junior college students at the same institute,” senior inspector Vivek Muglikar said.

He said Mhaske used stay on rent in a flat owned by Babasaheb Prabhakar Pandhawale (49). “Mhaske defaulted on rent. Pandhawale gave him two or three months to pay the dues. But when Mhaske failed to do so, Pandhawale told him to vacate the flat,” Muglikar said.

“This enraged Mhaske, who plotted revenge,” Muglikar said.

Late on Tuesday night, Mhaske and his friends — armed with sticks and sharp weapons — gathered at a spot in Kalewadi. They also carried a bottle of petrol.

“Around midnight they entered the society, doused the motorcycles with petrol and set them ablaze,” Muglikar said. “This woke up one of the residents, who raised an alarm,” he added.

A group of residents rushed to the parking lot. “The suspects threatened the residents with the weapons. Pandhawale tried to stop them, but the suspects tore his shirt and robbed Rs2,000,” he said.

Before he could flee, the residents caught Mhaske. “His juvenile accomplices managed to escape, but we tracked them down,” he said.

Police said the residents quickly put out the flames. “Only the motorcycle saddles were damaged,” police said.

There were 300 teams, each comprising two students from different schools in the district. They were keen to listen to Saldanha’s questions of the preliminary round and prove their mettle so that they get into the coveted finals meant for only six teams.

The Inter-School Fundamental Quiz conducted by Times NIE and Empathy on Thursday was noted for the huge participation of students. From early morning, students began flocking to the registration counter. Some schools arranged special transport facilities for their students.

Empathy project principal investigator Dr Neeraj Raizada, who led the Empathy campaign titled ‘Empowering People Against Hepatitis’, declared the quiz open.

Conceptualized by the Institute of Liver and Biliary Sciences (ILBS) director Dr Shiv Kumar Sarin, the campaign aims to create awareness on hepatitis and the funding support is from Airports Authority of India. Lloyd Saldanha from Greycaps took over and led the preliminary round which was a written one. The performance of students in the preliminary round was so impressive that the quiz master had to resort to tie-breaker to finalize the six teams in the final round.

“It was wonderful. The questions were very intricate, and the rounds were different from the quizzes we usually attend,” said Ganga and Malavika.

Representative image

JODHPUR: The Rajasthan High Court has issued notices to the state and Central governments and Central Law Commission seeking reply in six weeks, while hearing a petition challenging the legal age of bride and groom for marriage as mentioned in the law.

Petitioner Abdul Mannan, in his petition, stated that the difference of three years in the marriageable age between bride and the groom was discriminatory and hence a violation of fundamental rights. “The groom is legally allowed to marry at the age of 21 years while a bride’s legal age of marriage is 18 years. This gap of three years is discriminatory,” he argued.

When the division bench of chief justice Indrajit Mahanty and justice P S Bhatir enquired about the age according to the petitioner, he replied that both should have the same age of 21 years as the legal age for marriage. Mannan, in his petition, attributed the age difference an indicator of patriarchal mentality in the society and stated that there was no scientific basis of this perception.

“The law commission of India has also observed that there was no scientific ground for this perception and it bolsters the conservatism that bride should be younger than the groom,” he argued. Terming the practice as encouraging inequality for women, he stated that this was anti-global trends, as well as in contradiction to gender equality, gender justice and dignity of womenfolk.

He also termed it to be violative of Articles 14, 15 and 21 and stated that the age of bride and groom is the same in 125 countries. Citing a national conference on child marriage, he said that the issue had also been taken up by the National Human Rights Commission in this conference and a recommendation had been given to bring parity in the marriageable ages of both.

Convinced by the arguments, the court allowed the petition and issued notices returnable in six weeks.

TRICHY: Entrepreneurs at an export awareness programme on Thursday were told to go after eco-friendly products instead of plastics as they are in decent demand at the international market. Suggestions were also given to export the value-added agriculture products to the aspiring exporters.

The event was conducted by Tiruchirapalli District Tiny & Small Scale Industries Association (TIDITSSIA) in association with Director-General of Foreign Trade (DGFT) and MSME development institute and Federation of Indian Export Organisations (FIEO). Around 75 entrepreneurs participated in the programme at the TIDITSSIA complex in Ariyamangalam.

Entrepreneurs were told to watch the global markets and explore the research tools available in the online platforms to extract the data for narrowing down the desirable market and product to export.

“The markets of the United States of America and Australia have a good number of takers for eco-friendly products such as bamboo straws and betel nut plates. Exporters should attend the international trade fair and interact with the local stakeholders to understand the unique demand,” K Jayakumar, assistant director, FIEO told TOI.

Participants were told to utilize the subsidies and assistance provided by the state and central governments to participate in the international buyer-seller meetings.

Stakeholders including the District Industries Centre (DIC) urged the entrepreneurs to export their products to the countries where there is a demand.

“Value-added agro products and engineering products like valves and casings besides the windmill components from Trichy can be considered for export. We are planning to conduct buyer-seller meets to promote exports,” R Ilango, president, TIDITSSIA said.

KOCHI: Twenty one students of Dalian Medical University are stuck at Kunming airport in China after Singapore disallowed their transit to India through their airport on Thursday over concerns of Novel Coronavirus (nCov).

Of the 21 students, 20 are from Kerala. One student is a native of Tamil Nadu. The students decided to leave as the number of coronavirus cases has been increasing in the region where the university is located. Students said they booked tickets on February 3 from Kunming to Thiruvananthapuram via Singapore by Scoot airlines.

“When we arrived at Kunming airport we are told that only Singapore citizens will be allowed to board the flight and they will not carry Chinese citizens or any other nationals,” said Keerthana Rani , a house surgeon at Dalian university. The students said that though they pleaded with the officials of Scoot airlines, they expressed helplessness.

“We are now being told that the Norka is trying to get us to New Delhi via Bangkok and then to Thiruvananthapuram,” said Keerthana, who hails from Paravoor in Kollam.

Norka officials said that they were looking at all available options to fly them to Thiruvananthapuram but it is a task that is increasingly becoming difficult. “Airlines are not allowing transit. Countries like Thailand, Singapore, Malaysia and airlines like AirAsia, Singapore Airlines , Thai Airlines are not allowing transit of passengers from China,” said Norka Roots CEO Harikrishnan Namboothiri K.

Reports said Union minister of state for external affairs V Muraleedharan has asked Indian embassy in Beijing to help the students travel to India.

Students explored options of other flights operating to India but were told that for the next two days there will be no flights. “Even though we got in touch with the Indian embassy, there was no response,” said Keerthana. They cannot return to the university as they had ignored the message to stay back.

Relatives of the students are anxiously waiting for an information from the Centre. “They booked tickets via Singapore but were not informed that the country would impose a travel ban on people travelling from regions hit by coronavirus,” said Keerthana’s sister Karthika.

157,['7/02/2020'],Rajkot: Three held for adulteration of groundnut bought at minimum support price,"This story is from February 7, 2020

Accused at the market yard

RAJKOT: Three persons were arrested for mixing inferior quality groundnut in 156 gunny bags (weighing 35kg each) stored at Junagadh Market Yard on Thursday. The accused used to take out good quality groundnut procured at minimum support price (MSP) and mix it with poor quality nuts bought from the open market.

The accused, Pratik Sojitra (36), Keshu Vagadia (62) and Ramesh Makwana (42), were nabbed after CCTVs footage from the market yard examined on Saturday last showed the accused mixing the groundnut.

The inspection was conducted on Saturday after a farmer’s body Khedut Hit Rakshak Samiti, alleged possibility of a scam on January 30.

“Though the accused had covered the CCTVs with gunny bags before committing the crime, they were caught on the other CCTV cameras installed inside the market yard. The fourth accused shown in the footage along with the other accused turned out to be a labourer,” said Pradeepsinh Jadeja , Junagadh deputy superintendent of police.

During his interrogation, Sojitra, who has a firm in the market yard, told the cops that he would buy poor quality groundnut from the farmers in the day and mix it in the bags containing good quality groundnut, procured at MSP at night.

While Vagadia was the accountant in Sojitra’s firm, Makwana was a labour contractor.

Yogesh Vala, manager of Gujarat Civil Supply Department, Junagadh, said: “When we carried out inspection, we found 156 gunny bags containing groundnut were either wet or had nuts of inferior quality. The bags, which were supposed to be sealed in the presence of farmers, were not done so.”

“When we checked the CCTV footages we saw four unidentified men sneaking into the yard who later covered the CCTVs with gunny bags. After this, the miscreants may have allegedly culled out good quality groundnut from the bags and mixed inferior quality nuts into the bags to maintain weight,” Vala said.

Apart from the adulteration, the gunny bags also weighed less, he added.

In August last year, a total of 30,000 sacks of groundnut (containing 35kg each) were found to be mixed with sand and pebbles in Jetpur town of Rajkot district.

TRICHY: After Bharathidasan University (BDU) omitted the status of approval from distance education bureau (DEB) of University Grants Commission (UGC) in the admission advertisement for distance education programmes, candidates are now sceptical about applying.

BDU, which is yet to get DEB approval chose to omit the same in its advertisement that was published in newspapers last week. Offering many undergraduate and postgraduate courses, the university had mentioned February 28 as the last date to submit applications.

Getting approval from DEB is essential for any institution to offer various programmes through distance mode. State universities like Alagappa, Madurai Kamaraj , Manonmaniam Sundaranar and Tamil University which had recently advertised for their programmes offered through distance mode had mentioned that they possess DEB approval. This has created confusion among students if the courses offered through distance mode by BDU will be valid. “When other state universities could manage to get approval why couldn’t BDU?” asked M Senthil from Woriayur who was planning to join a course in the centre for distance education (CDE) of BDU.

A Ilangovan, director in-charge of CDE, BDU said the university has applied for approval and it may get it any time. He further said that students need not panic as BDU got better score in the recent NAAC assessment which makes the university eligible to offer programmes in distance mode.

The university was unable to apply for DEB approval in mid 2018 through online mode in the absence of better NAAC score. Other universities managed to get approval by giving an undertaking that they will fare well in the NAAC assessment. BDU chose the NAAC way instead of giving undertaking, he said. “DEB portal was open from mid November last year and we have applied for the same. We have satisfied all the criteria and we will get the approval without any hassle,” Illangovan said.

Asked why it wasn’t mentioned in the advertisement, Ilangovan said that the university didn’t wanted to create unnecessary confusion and chose to avoid it as anyway it is eligible to offer the distance education programmes.

164,['7/02/2020'],Extension to ‘toothless’ Marathwada Development Board questioned,"This story is from February 7, 2020

AURANGABAD: The extended term of the Marathwada Development Board (MDB) is set to end by April, triggering debate whether the statutory body should be given another extension in view of its image as a ‘toothless’ body.

The crucial body has been accused of being powerless and reduced to making mere recommendations , with many of them said to be falling on deaf ears for years.

While the MDB itself does not have any executive or financial powers, things have gone from bad to worse as it has been cash-starved too.

Established with two other development boards — Vidarbha and Rest of Maharashtra — on May 1, 1994, the MDB got its term extended till April 30, 2020, by a Presidential Order five years ago.

Ashok Belkhode, an expert member of the MDB, from the health sector, said, “As per its constitution, the board submits its recommendations to the governor, who in turn is expected to prevail upon the state government for acting on such proposals. The recommendations remained on paper only.”

Citing an example, Belkhode said the state government has not taken any steps to set up a nursing school and a paramedical institute in the region despite repeated recommendations. He said the purpose of setting up the body to achieve real progress and development of the region could not be achieved due to “official apathy”.

Shankar Nagare, expert member (irrigation), said the governor and the state government must ensure meaningful existence for the statutory body concerned.

Chairman says board can provide a roadmap

Bhagwat Karad, the chairman of the board, said, “It is a bitter truth that the governments in the past did not pay attention to the board.

TRICHY: Condemning the union government’s decision to reduce the fund allotted for the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee ( MGNREGA ) Scheme in the Union budget, Thanjavur District Cauvery Farmers Protection Association will hold a massive protest on February 12 urging the government to enhance it.

Allocations in the union budget for various schemes under the rural development department has been reduced to Rs 1.2 lakh crore from Rs 1.22 lakh crore, while the funds allotted for MGNREGA came down by Rs 9,500 to Rs 61,500 crore, farmers alleged.

“At a time when thousands of agriculture labourers have lost their income as there is no proper employment in farming, this employment guarantee scheme has been helping them to a certain extent. However, the union government has cut down the fund. This is unfair,” said secretary of Thanjavur District Cauvery Farmers Protection Association Swamimalai S Vimalnathan alleged.

The protest will be held near Gandhi park in Kumbakonam, Vimalnathan added.

KOLKATA: Acting on the order from the school education department commissioner, who had issued a circular asking 26 prominent city schools to ensure that their students avail of either carpools or school buses from April and restricted the use of personal vehicles to “exceptional cases”, several institutes have set the ball rolling for the changeover.La Martiniere Boys School principal John Rafi has issued a circular requesting parents to stop ferrying students in individual private cars. To transport kids in hired carpools, the school management will help in identifying carpools to assist guardians. Rafi has also written a letter to the school education department regarding the inability of the school to purchase buses or take responsibility of carpools due to infrastructure and funds constraints.“This is the first time the school has assured to take responsibility for arranging or informing about carpools,” said the father of a Class III student. “If they facilitate such a move, more and more parents will be convinced to shun private cars,” he added. In the notice, the school clearly stated that from April 1, the school will not take any responsibility for individual private cars. According to a senior school official, the move was “inevitable and necessary” after the state order.“Once we receive the letter from La Martiniere School, we shall forward it to the chief minister’s office,” said a Nabanna source. However, he added that the schools were “bound” to make alternative arrangements to ensure no individual private cars ferry students to and from schools.Modern High School For Girls is holding talks with the transport department to make arrangements for renting buses. There are five school buses and 2,500 students. “We are finding ways to facilitate the order. The school administrators are discussing the matter with transport officials and we hope to find a solution soon. Also, a circular will be sent to the guardians informing them about the order,” said director Devi Kar. The school will ask for suggestions from parents.At Don Bosco School, Park Circus , too, a governing body meeting was held on Thursday to find ways to implement the order. “We will not buy buses. However, the school shall facilitate the arrangements. We will hold discussions with the transport department and, if necessary, rent buses to commute students. But first, we shall hold meetings with the parents,” said principal Bikash Mondal.St James’ School principal TH Ireland said a list of carpools and chartered buses will be put up along with the phone numbers ahead of the next academic session. “The parents will have to coordinate and arrange for carpools. In our school, around 65% of students arrive in carpools. Soon, we shall distribute the government order and inform the parents about the ban on private cars,” Ireland said.St Xavier’s Collegiate School has not yet received the circular from the school education directorate. “We shall comply with the order and inform parents to stop ferrying kids in private cars. We will facilitate carpools once we receive the circular,” said Father M Thamacin Arulappan, principal of the school.On schools who are yet not interested in taking the responsibility of transporting students and have left the decision on parents, Subhas Datta, a green crusader and key litigant in NGT on the city's air pollution, said it was a shameless act on the part of the schools not to take the onus of congestion and pollution caused by school-bound private cars. “What are they teaching students — not owning responsibility and the art of passing the buck?

Mumbai: The Shivaji Park Gymkhana is away from the plot where the Bal Thackeray memorial is to come up, BMC told the Bombay High Court on Thursday. This response came after a petitioner , challenging the validity of the conversion of the land housing the Mayor’s Bungalow, told the court there is apprehension that the memorial will affect the gymkhana as well.

A bench of Justices Satyaranjan Dharmadhikari and Riyaz Chagla heard four public interest litigations (PILs) in respect to the conversion of reservation of the Mayor’s Bungalow for the late Shiv Sena leader’s memorial.

Even as the judges were posting the PILs for admission, advocate Sunip Sen sought a stay and said the gymkhana may be affected as well. Senior advocate for BMC, Anil Sakhare, said the gymkhana is not a subject matter of the PILs. “Three big buildings are in between,” Sakhare said, adding that the Savarkar Memorial, Mahatma Gandhi swimming pool and Vanita Samaj are situated before the gymkhana.

Advocate Pradeep Havnur said his client was not opposed to the memorial, but it cannot be at the cost of conversion of the Mayor’s Bungalow. “They are also putting up a memorial at Aurangabad,” he said. The judges questioned whether there is no power in law for the BMC to effect a conversion or take back property which vests originally in it.

Senior advocate Darius Khambata, for the Balasaheb Thackeray Rashtriya Smarak, said the BMC Act was amended specifically to provide for this memorial. The judges posted for admission in March so that a final hearing can be held.

Representative image

AURANGABAD: The Aurangabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) has decided to set up its own hot mix plant for maintenance of roads using smart city funds. A decision in this regard will be taken by the smart city board of directors.

In a TOI report published on February 3, municipal commissioner Astik Kumar Pandey had said that the municipal corporation plans to raise its own hot mix plant for maintenance of roads.

During the general body meeting on Thursday, corporators raised several issues pertaining to bad shape of roads in their wards. In the presence of Pandey, mayor Nandkumar Ghodele said the AMC has decided to set up the hot mix plant using the smart city funds. “The matter will be taken up in the next meeting with the smart city board of directors,” he said. Ghodele asked executive engineer to prepare an action plan on priority and submit it to the board.

All major roads in the city are either under the care of the Public Works Department (PWD) or the national highway division. Other key roads are being concretised under various projects funded by the state government. However, the internal roads in every ward of the civic body are riddled with potholes.

When asked, the municipal corporation expressed its inability to repair these roads or reconstruct them due to shortage of funds.

Every year before the Ganesh festival, the civic body issues a tender inviting private agencies to carry out repair works on these roads and spends up to Rs 5 crore on the same. However, the work is far from satisfactory as the patchwork comes of within a couple of days.

To address this issue, Pandey proposed the hot mix plant. The municipal commissioner, who is also the CEO of the Aurangabad Smart City Development Corporation Ltd, has the authority to take a decision in this regard.

AURANGABAD: People with disabilities seeking honorariums from the Aurangabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) blocked the vehicles of the mayor and the municipal commissioner after Monday’s general body meeting — forcing both of them to leave in autorickshaws instead.

Following the protest, the municipal corporation released the honorariums of 476 people with disabilities.

Incidentally, the disabled people have been demanding honorariums from the AMC for their welfare and rehabilitation since the past two years. The AMC has even verified the number of registered people with disabilities in its jurisdiction. However, citing poor financial condition, the civic body had not released honorariums to all.

As a result, activists representing the people with disabilities, under the banner of Prahar Apang Kranti Andolan, have been protesting after every general body meeting in past few months.

On Monday, they barged into the AMC compound and raised slogans. When municipal commissioner Astik Kumar Pandey was heading out of the building in his official vehicle, his way was blocked by the agitating crowd. Pandey had to hear out the concerns of the protesters and was forced to leave in an autorickshaw.

A few minutes later, mayor Nandkumar Ghodele’s vehicle too was blocked in a similar fashion, compelling him to take an autorickshaw as well.

Notably, the stir resulted in the municipal corporation immediately releasing the honorariums of 476 people with disabilities.

Apang Kranti Andolan’s Shivaji Gade said that all people with disabilities who were verified by the AMC have received their honorariums. “People with disabilities were informed that this is the last general body meeting before the model code of conduct kicks in for the AMC election, which is why they were persistent that the money is released,” he said.

PATNA: Union power minister R K Singh on Thursday categorically ruled out any proposal for privatization of Bihar State Power Holding Company Limited (BSPHCL) as well as its subsidiary companies. “There will be no privatisation of BSPHCL and its subsidiary companies,” the minister said in a telephonic conversation with BSPHCL CMD-cum-principal secretary of energy department Pratyaya Amrit.

The minister’s remark came after the recent announcement of five workers’ union bodies of the power companies under the banner of Vidyut Kamgar Padhadhikari Abhiyanta Sanyukt Sangharsh Morcha regarding a “symbolic” 24-hour power shutdown across the state on February 11 and 12 against the move to privatise the company.

Pratyaya seconded minister Singh’s remark and said the company would treat the proposed strike as “illegal” under Bihar State Essential Service Maintenance Act and Essential Service Maintenance Regulation (ESMR), 2020.

“Action will be taken against such employees and engineers who join the strike proposed to be held from 6am on February 11 to 6am on February 12,” he said.

Addressing media persons at Vidyut Bhawan here, Pratyaya said he as well as state energy minister Bijendra Prasad Yadav have made it clear on several occasions that there was no proposal to privatise BSPHCL and its subsidiary companies.

“I even held several video-conferencing sessions in January and February and addressed the employees and engineers of all the circles in the state. However, some rumourmongers are still misleading the employees,” Pratyaya said.

However, PESA general secretary Surendra Kumar refused to budge. “How can we trust the CMD? He did not even issue a single letter in support of his assertion that privatisation will not take place. Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman had announced on February 1 that in order to ensure continuous power supply, certain models will be adopted, such as privatizing state-run discoms and multiple supply, network and distribution franchisees,” Kumar said.

The delivery date for the three ferry boats was November 24, 2019, which is 100 days from August 14, 2019 when the work was to be completed, as per the agreement.

“We have intimated the company about the fine. The company was supposed to build and hand over three ferry boats, and will be imposed with a penalty of Rs 2,000 per ferry boat. They will have to pay Rs 6,000 per day,” an official of the RND said while speaking to TOI.

The RND’s survey report however indicates that not much progress has been made and the construction is “very slow”. The shipyard has therefore been ordered to pay the penalty as “liquidated damages” from November 25, 2019 onwards till the construction is completed.

The penalty amount will be deducted from Aquarius’s bill.

Three new ferries were to be intorduced to replace some of the oldest ferries in the state; Canacona and Cumbharjua. The new vessels are expected to be built with single-engine machines of 100 horse power.

KOLKATA: When Miss Shefali succumbed to cardiac arrest at her Sodepur house on Thursday, it marked the end of not just the journey of an artiste, but also of an era. Her death at the age of 73 ended another chapter of Bengal’s lust for romanticism with the art and artistes.Born Arati Das, Shefali’s teenage years saw a meteoric rise — from being a domestic help at an Anglo-Indian household to becoming Kolkata’s cabaret queen, who was a rage at Firpo’s and the Oberoi Grand. Films and theatre followed and legend has it that Satyajit Ray had come to pick her up on her first day of shooting for ‘Pratidwandi’, where she was cast as a nurse. Director Sandip Ray remembers her as a “respectful” and “affectionate” professional. “Baba had wanted to see the room where she performed and so we went there. At the end of her performance, she made Baba wear the garland that she was wearing. This act inspired Baba to replicate a similar scene in ‘Seemabadha’,” he said.Was it the Ray factor that set her apart from so many other cabaret dancers? According to her ‘Seemabadha’ co-actor Barun Chanda, the Ray factor was certainly a part of it, but it was not the only factor responsible. “She might have started as a cabaret girl, but she certainly went beyond it,” Chanda said. Aishika Chakraborty, professor of Jadavpur University’s School of Women’s Studies and author of ‘Kolkatar Cabaret: Bangali, Jounata Ebang Miss Shefali’, attributes her enigma to her “supreme talent” and training. “Here was a gifted teenage refugee dancer from a half-broke family of east Pakistan who, in a patriarchal world, refused to play the victim card. She danced till as late as 2000, did jatra, went to villages to do macha shows and even had her own dance group,” Chakraborty said.Yet, the last years of her life saw her in deep financial crisis. Her number of dependents were unlimited. “She had supported so many girls during her heyday but never thought that one day she herself would face financial crunch,” said niece Elvina Shefali. “She would pick up beggars from streets and give them two options — get married or become a cabaret dancer. If they chose to marry, she would buy their gold ornaments. If not, she would train and give them shows,” Chakraborty added.But the film industry never really acknowledged her. No pivotal roles came her way. A biopic on her was announced but never got made. A Konkona Sen Sharma-directed webseries is on the cards. Despite being trained in various art forms, including Can-Can, Hawaiian hula and belly dancing, she didn’t become popular judge at any dance reality show. “That was my aunt’s biggest regret,” said her niece.Post her death, countless social media posts paying homage to her is perhaps society’s first attempt at celebrating a power woman who loved to describe her own life as “history”.",kolkata,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74000610,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-545655,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/with-miss-shefali-a-slice-of-rays-calcutta-passes-away/articleshow/73992503.cms

Aurangabad: As the work to increase the height of the Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj statue at Kranti Chowk will not be completed by February 19, the civic body will install a fibre-reinforced plastic statue of the Maratha icon on Shiv Jayanti.

During the general body meeting on Thursday, Rajgaurav Wankhede of BJP asked the Aurangabad Municipal Corporation’s administration about the progress on the statue’s elevation. Wankhede reminded mayor Nandkumar Ghodele of his statement in the previous general body meeting — that the statue work will be completed by February 19.

Ghodele, in response, told Wankhede that he and all members in the House are sensitive to the issue. Wankhede asked why was the February 19 deadline not met with, even though it has been six months since the old statue was removed.

Executive engineer Hemant Kolhe said all the bids received in the first tender for installing the statue had faults, therefore, re-tendering had to be done.

On this, corporator Raju Shinde pointed out the flaws in the tender document prepared by the AMC. He said that the AMC should specify the material with which it wants the agency to prepare the statue.

When the BJP members asked if the state government has approved funds required for the project, Ghodele said that the project will not fall short of funds.

He added that the statue will be raised in a time-bound manner but the project will not be completed before February 19. As an alternative, AMC will erect a fibre-reinforced plastic statue.

184,['7/02/2020'],Waste management: Government seeks to put onus on local bodies,"This story is from February 7, 2020

PANAJI: The government on Wednesday proposed to amend the Goa Panchayat Raj Act, to make panchayats directly responsible for garbage management. Panchayat minister Mauvin Godinho told the assembly during Question Hour that the act would be amended to make panchayats responsible for garbage management, while replying to a question tabled by former PWD minister Ramkrishna Dhavalikar.

Dhavalikar questioned the government’s authority in issuing a circular to panchayats, which are autonomous bodies, ordering them not to issue occupancy certificates to large construction projects and multi-dwelling units, if they do not carry-out proper waste management.

The circular in question, and another one linked to the first one, have been withdrawn, Godinho retorted. He also placed a copy of the revoked circular on the table of the House.

Dhavalikar was not satisfied. “You (panchayat minister) have no authority to issue such a circular to an autonomous body. You went beyond the act. Who gave you that power?,” demanded Dhavalikar.

Stating he was within his “administrative powers” to do so, Godinho said they were compelled to issue the circular as panchayats were not taking their civic responsibility seriously, and they (the panchayat directorate) were answerable to court in various petitions pertaining to waste management. “Panchayats are not answerable to court but the panchayat ministry is,” he said. After a note from advocate general Devidas Pangam, he said they decided to amend the act.

Opposition leader Digambar Kamat brought it to the notice of the government that many panchayats have not received the revoked circular, and Godinho assured that all panchayats would receive it shortly. Porvorim MLA Rohan Khaunte said no action is taken against illegal constructions, and said they were on the rise.

The township will be built as part of the PMAY-U

AURANGABAD: The civic body will invite agencies who can prepare a detailed project report (DPR) and carry out the construction of a township under the Pradhan Mantri Awaas Yojna (PMAY)-Urban.

In the general body meeting, on members’ insistence, deputy municipal commissioner Sumant More was called to present the status of an affordable housing project of the Aurangabad Municipal Corporation under the PMAY-U. More said the AMC has identified land for raising a township in Teesgaon.

“The AMC had written to the district collector on January 8 for acquisition of that land for Affordable Housing in Partnership (AHP), the third component of PMAY-U. Following the receipt from the district collector, the process for preparing DPR will be done and then the project will be raised under public-private partnership,” More said.

BJP member Raju Shinde said the approval from district collector is likely to come soon. He proposed that in the meantime, the AMC should begin the process of issuing tender. “The PMAY-U scheme aims to provide housing for all by 2022. To achieve this, the AMC must invite bids from an agency which can prepare the DPR and complete the project,” Shinde said.

Subsequently, Mayor Nandkumar Ghodele asked More to initiate the tender process within seven days in the way Shinde suggested. “The process should be initiated before the model code of conduct is implemented for the AMC election,” mayor said.

House leader Vikas Jain asked the AMC administration to ensure that the criteria laid out by the Centre are met with while issuing the tender. More said that once the site is approved, the land measurement has to be carried out.

Worried about his son’s health, the man insisted Dr Narote attend to his son urgently. When the doctor asked him to wait, the man called a ‘bhau’ (brother in Marathi) to complain.After a brief conversation with ‘bhau’, the man asked the doctor to talk to the person at the other end. Not knowing that the ‘bhau’ on phone was minister Rathod, the doctor refused to attend the call saying he is busy and will talk only after 10 minutes or else ask the ‘bhau’ to come to the hospital.Rathod apparently overheard the conversation. He then contacted Dr Kamble demanding action against the junior doctor. Dr Kamble immediately suspended the doctor for eight days from Tuesday.Speaking to TOI on Thursday, Dr Kamble said he has suspended Dr Narote after verifying what had happened. He also informed that show cause memos have been served on two male nurses and a woman nurse who were on duty when the incident took place. “The three have been show caused for not attending the phone call of the minister when the doctor was busy,” said Dr Kamble.On Thursday, a delegation of resident doctors met the dean and requested him to revoke Dr Narote’s suspension. After the meeting, Dr Kamble announced a three-member committee, under chairmanship of Dr Surendra Gawarle, HoD of ENT department, to probe the matter and submit a report in two days.Meanwhile, local unit of Maharashtra Association of Resident Doctors (MARD) has threatened to launch an agitation if the doctor’s suspension was not revoked.Rathod admitted to having asked the dean to take action against Dr Narote. Narrating the incident, Rathod said on Monday a person from his constituency had called him to complain about the GMCH doctor not attending to his son.“When the worried father wanted Dr Narote to speak to me on phone, he not only refused to talk but also ‘insulted’ the elderly person,” said Rathod. “Three nurses on duty also refused to attend the call and hence I had to instruct the dean to initiate action against the ‘irresponsible’ doctor,” the minister added.“After the suspension, Dr Narote sent me a message apologizing for the incident.

188,['7/02/2020'],Objections raised on ward reservation during GB meet,"This story is from February 7, 2020

The GB meeting was held on Thursday

AURANGABAD: The corporators of the Aurangabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) raised objections to the ward reservation process, for the civic election, in Thursday’s general body meeting.

However, after taking legal advice the discussion was closed with mayor asking the members to lodge formal objections by the prescribed deadline.

The AMC’s election department, under the guidelines of the State Election Commission, conducted the ward reservation allocation process for scheduled caste (SC), scheduled tribe (ST), other backward class (OBC), SC-women, ST-women, OBC-women and women (general) categories on Monday.

During the general body meeting, Sitaram Sure, the corporator of Surewadi, near Harsul, initiated the discussion.

He said the process had done injustice to the people of Harsul. There are nine wards in the Harsul area, and all of them had been previously reserved for the SC category. This time too, all of the wards have been reserved for other categories. Therefore, there is no ward here for the general category. He wanted a three-member inquiry committee to look into this matter.

Surekha Sanap, the Brijwadi corporator from Shiv Sena, objected to the name change of her ward to Savitri Nagar Chikalthana Naregaon East.

“In 1982, Brijwadi was amongst the 18 villages around Aurangabad that were included in the AMC. If the boundaries of the ward are same, why is Brijwadi’s name removed?” she asked.

Afsar Khan, Congress corporator from Jaisingpura, Bhavsingpura, questioned the basis on which 2,500 voters from other wards were included in his ward. Gangadhar Dhage, MIM group leader, alleged the ward reservations are done in a way that will ensure that MIM corporators do not get elected to the House again.

Mayor Nandkumar Ghodele said that after he spoke to the lawyer of the Election Commission (EC) and the AMC’s legal advisor, it has been decided that the discussion is closed.

“The window to file objections on the ward name, reservation, population and boundaries assigned by the EC is open until February 11. Those who have objections, including the public, can file objections in prescribed format,” Ghodele said.

The government has extended the utilisation of TDR certificates issued by GHMC up to the limits of ORR in Hyderabad Metropolitan Development Authority (HMDA) jurisdiction. Citizens can view the available TDR in the TDR Bank application. The existing manual TDR certificate holders will be given an opportunity to convert the manual certificate into digital platform.

191,['7/02/2020'],Goa budget: House adjourned four times amid opposition protests,"This story is from February 7, 2020

The agitating members had to be whisked out by the marshals

PORVORIM: The state legislative assembly was adjourned four times on Thursday with the opposition creating uproar in the well of the House over the arrest of independent MLA Rohan Khaunte at midnight for allegedly wrongfully restraining BJP spokesperson Premanand Mahambre.

With the opposition unrelenting in its protest, no business other than the budget presentation by chief minister Pramod Sawant was transacted on day 5 of the session.

They raised slogans “we want justice”, “shame, shame” as Sawant started his budget speech at 3pm. No amount of warnings by speaker Rajesh Patnekar could silence the opposition members who rushed to the well of the House raising slogans.

The uproar continued for around ten minutes with the speaker repeatedly asking the protesting members to stop disturbing the House. On more than one occasion he asked them to either “withdraw or boycott” the House. Finally, the agitating members were whisked out by the marshals.

Earlier in the day, House proceedings were adjourned three times during the first half as the opposition did not budge from its stance — justice for the undemocratic treatment meted out to Khaunte, who was arrested while the House was in session.

As a mark of protest, the opposition members tied a black ribbon on their arms. When the House met at 11.30am, leader of the opposition Digambar Kamat said that what happened on the intervening night of Wednesday and Thursday was “undemocratic and irresponsible”.

“You (speaker) are our father in this House. You ought to have protected our interest,” Kamat said.

He also said that the speaker should have taken Congress MLA Pratapsingh Rane’s statement as he was with Khaunte when the alleged incident took place on Wednesday.

“How could you issue permission without an inquiry,” Kamat said. He was supported by GFP chief Vijai Sardesai.

The speaker told the House that he was intimated about the incident. “Under Rule 99 a prior permission was sought as the incident happened in the precincts of the House and it was granted,” he said.

The speaker’s response failed to satisfy agitating members and they once again raised slogans. “I have done my job as per the rules,” the speaker said before adjourning the House till 12pm.

Nothing had changed when the House resumed. Opposition members created a ruckus yet again, leading to a second adjournment within half-an-hour.

Opposition members objected to an alleged note submitted by some BJP activists to the speaker demanding Khaunte’s suspension from the House. The speaker said, “It (the note) doesn’t matter as I will not act on it.”

The opposition rushed to the well yet again, and House was adjourned till 2.30pm.

Speaking to reporters later, the opposition said they will continue to protest until the person on whose “false” complaint Khaunte was arrested, is also arrested.

Rane said, he was with Khaunte and nothing — as stated in the complaint — happened. Likening it to a “Gestapo raj”, he said it will not be tolerated.

“This is the first time in the history of Goa that the opposition was taken out at the time of presenting the budget,” Kamat said.

Nagpur: Kin of victims, who die in attacks by nilgais and monkeys, will get Rs15 lakh as compensation and those injured will get aid up to Rs1.25 lakh. This is for the first time that nilgais and monkeys have been included in the list of wild animals involved in attacks.

The decision was taken by Maharashtra forest minister Sanjay Rathod at a meeting in Mantralaya on Wednesday. The official government note will be issued in a day or two.

“Till now kin of those who died in tiger, leopard, sloth bear, wild dog, wild boar, gaur, crocodile, elephant, fox and wolf attacks only used to get compensation. We have added nilgai and monkey to the list now,” Rathod told TOI.

The minister said of the Rs15 lakh, a cheque of Rs3 lakh will be handed over to the kin immediately. The remaining Rs12 lakh will be kept as fixed deposit and interest towards this amount will be deposited in the savings bank account.

For injuries that need to be treated at private hospitals there will be a cap of Rs20,000 per person. In case of permanent disability, the victim will get Rs5 lakh compensation.

According to sources, the government is also contemplating to provide financial assistance to snake bite victims. All snakes are listed in Schedule I-IV under the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972.

“There have been demand from people’s representatives to give compensation to snake bite victims but owing to many cases, the issue was never taken up seriously. There are several nitty-gritty’s in such cases which will be resolved before taking a final decision,” said sources close to forest minister.

KT Rama Rao

HYDERABAD: After warning newly-elected corporators and councillors that they may lose their job if they fail to deliver, now it is the turn of municipal commissioners. Municipal administration minister KT Rama Rao has said the state government will not compromise on providing corruption-free building permission and other services to the citizens. “The commissioners will be dismissed from services, not just suspension, if they are found guilty,” he said during a meeting with commissioners of newly-created municipalities and town planning wing staff on Thursday

Stating that the state government was giving priority for both sanitation and greenery, the minister said every municipality should have both green plan and sanitation plan for their respective urban local bodies. Apart from these plans, -the urban local bodies should give preference for online services, grievance redressal and corruption-free building permissions, he added.

“The commissioners have to supervise sanitation works from 4.30am every day for better environment. To control seasonal diseases in their respective municipalities, they can have health plans,” KTR said.

The ministers said the new Municipalities Act should be implemented letter and spirit in the state. KTR gave an overview of the new Municipal Act, which was aimed to provide fast, transparent, and corruption-free governance, and urged the officers to implement it effectively. He said the municipal commissioners should ensure proper drinking water supply, sanitation maintenance and an increase in green cover in urban local bodies by earmarking 10% budget for greenery in their respective areas.

“Unlike any other state in the country, the TS-bPass (building permission) will grant permissions to a citizen within 21 days to construct a house. The commissioners should ensure permissions be given within the stipulated time,” KTR said.

The minister asked the officials to come up with innovative programmes to level up sanitation works in the municipalities. He instructed the officials to increase the number of public toilets and SHE toilets for women in the corporations and municipalities.

Mumbai: The Bombay high court on Monday frowned at the state government for not implementing a law to prevent and tackle fires, 14 years after it came into force.

A bench of Justices Satyaranjan Dharmadhikari and Riyaz Chagla heard a public interest litigation (PIL) that sought the implementation of the National Building Code of India norms , amongs other reliefs, by amending the development control regulation.

The judges questioned how the government was implementing the Maharashtra Fire Prevention and Safety Measures Act, 2006. “How are you enforcing the law?” asked Justice Dharmadhikari. Jagtiani pointed out that the act has an overriding effect on other laws. “Compliance with other laws will not be deemed to be compliance with that of the act,” he added.

The judges said the act is comprehensive and talks of prevention and life saving. Adjourning the hearing to Thursday, the bench said the assistance of the Maharashtra Legal Services Authority at the state and that at the district, Mumbai city and suburban levels may be taken to create awareness.

PANAJI: The budget for 2020-21 shows that Goa’s public debt continues to march upwards and is expected to hit Rs 17,952 crore, or 19.46%, of the gross state domestic product (GSDP) by March 2021. The documents also indicate that public debt for the current fiscal is likely to hit Rs 16,472 crore. This does not include the government’s internal debt, which is estimated at an additional Rs 6,000 crore.

The economic survey for 2019-20, released a day earlier, stated that the public debt for the current fiscal would be Rs 15,008 crore. The gross fiscal deficit for 2020-21 is estimated at 2.01% or Rs 1,856.65 crore, which is within the prescribed norm of 3% of the GSDP.

Sawant projected outstanding liabilities through state bonds will stand at Rs 14,110 crore, while loans from Nabard will hit Rs 765 crore.

“The liabilities have grown gradually, but the sustained public expenditure by the state has a high multiplier effect on the economy. The outstanding debt is expected to remain under the ceiling set by the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management,” the chief minister said.

In his budget speech, Sawant made it clear that central taxes form a major share of the state’s revenue. Acknowledging Goa’s rising liabilities, he said he would endeavour to contain the expenditure for essential purposes without compromising on the state’s welfare.

With the red gram production in the state increasing to 2.7 lakh metric tonnes, the TRS government has written a letter to the central government requesting that the procurment agency be directed to purchase an additional 54,000 metric tons.

During a review meeting with officials on Thursday, agriculture minister S Niranjan Reddy said more produce needs to be purchased as red gram farmers were facing problems. The purchase arrangements have to be completed after elections to agricultural cooperative societies. The minister directed the officials to ensure there was no delay in supply of urea in the state.

Addressing a news conference at Mapusa, Porvorim Block Congress president Shankar Phadte said, “This political thug has become frustrated. We strongly condemn this kind of act within the precincts of the assembly and demand that a chargesheet be filed against the MLA within 30 days after examining all the witnesses and recording their statements.”

Khaunte was elected for the second time in 2017 with the backing of the Congress. But he extended support to the BJP though Congress was the single largest party. In return, he was rewarded with revenue and IT portfolios. He was dropped from the Pramod Sawant cabinet in July 2019.

A general view of NMC's birth and death registration department

NAGPUR: The number of people visiting the birth and death registration department of Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) has shot up exponentially in the last three months, soon after talk of the National Register of Citizens ( NRC ) and the Citizenship Amendment Act ( CAA ) gripped the nation.

Officials say that from not more than three to four daily queries, the number has jumped to 300-340 visitors daily. In January, 5,581 citizens visited the department searching for birth and death certificates-related issues. Of this, 4,643 were Muslims.

The number of non-Muslims too — though in double digits only — is considerably higher than before, when very few people would trickle in to the office through the day.

A bulk of these people belong to the lower and middle income groups. Officials are having a hard time explaining the nitty-grittier of the process to them.

Those unable to decipher which identity proofs and supporting documents are needed for processing of their applications have been doing the rounds of the NMC headquarters in Civil Lines.

The NMC department had not bothered to maintain a visitor’s register earlier, given the scant footfalls. After the sustained recent rush at the office, however, officials have decided to keep a count of citizens coming there for name corrections, additions and seeking birth and death certificates.

The department is witnessing heavy rush everyday, particularly during morning hours. On Thursday, when TOI visited the department, harried citizens were seen queued up at the lone window manned by two officials.

Roohi Abid, a resident of Pili Nadi on Kamptee Road, has been coming for two days to get the death certificate of her grandfather Hussain Baig, who died in 1963. “We have dadajaan’s school leaving certificate, but need his death certificate to establish that we have been living here for three generations,” Roohi says.

Vegetable seller Munni Begum needs the birth certificates of her two kids. “I have been coming here for two weeks, but the records have not been found,” she said.

Munni was informed about the process to be followed when records are not found, yet she is unable to understand what is needed.

Similarly, Haseena Begum has been told about the process. “I am coming here for more than 15 days, but they are not showing me the records,” she states.

Several others like them are in a state of panic.

Daily wager Nathu Dongre, a resident of Somwari Quarters in east Nagpur, says he came for the addition of his son’s name in the birth certificate. “He was born in 1992. I never felt the need to do so, but now it is important,” he said, without referring to the NRC-CAA controversy.

“This is just to keep a record,” Dongre adds, pointing towards the large number of Muslims around him.

MUZAFFARNAGAR: Five persons were booked for allegedly manhandling members of Uttarakhand police team who were in Muzaffarnagar district to arrest an accused involved in an excise related case which was reportedly pending in the neighbouring hill state, the police said on Thursday.

The five persons also included the man, identified as Dharmender Sharma, whom the Uttarakhand cops came to arrest and got involved in a scuffle. Sources said the incident occurred late on Wednesday at Mandla village in Purkazi near Uttar Pradesh-Uttarakhand border. Soon, the accused Dharmender Sharma and his four other associates fled from the village.

Dharmender has been accused in a case - under the Excise Act - in Uttarakhand’s Devprayag town. Sources added that some villagers intervened and started manhandling the police team when Dharmender was being taken away by the visiting cops.

The local police have registered a case at Purkazi police station against Dharmender and four others Mohit Sharma, Budhu, Mange Ram and Pupu.

Station house officer of Purkazi police station, Pankaj Tyagi, said, “A case has been registered under various sections against Dharmender and others. Probe is currently on. Action will be taken accordingly.”

The ‘Happy Street’ at Law Garden ahead of its inauguration

AHMEDABAD: Police in the city on Wednesday afternoon booked eight hawkers, who earlier did business near Law Garden, at what will soon become a designated food vending area called ‘Happy Street’, for protesting against the AMC for displacing them.

Navrangpura police officials said the hawkers had been booked for organizing a protest without police permission and had been detained under Section 188 of the IPC. A similar incident took place on Thursday, and resulted in a fracas between an encroachment removal team of AMC and police officials, and protesting hawkers near Vastrapur lake .

V A Parmar, sub-inspector of Law Garden chowky in the FIR stated that they had been deployed in bandobust to remove encroachments from ‘Happy Street’ when a group of 30-35 hawkers, waving banners against the AMC arrived from Navrangpura and began airing their grievances in public.

They had no permission to organize a protest and were detained, said a police official. “Rakesh, the president of All-India Hawkers Union was detained along with Alpesh, Paresh Dayaram, Bharat Tolaji , Manubhai Bhupatsinh, Premkumar Ramprasad, Dinesh Bhavan and Satish Nekram,” said a police official.

At Vastrapur lake, cops and officials of the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) faced stiff opposition from hawkers when they set out to remove encroachments in the area on Thursday morning. Some 50 hawkers, including women, gathered at the spot and resisted the efforts of the cops and AMC officials.

Some of them allegedly abused the cops and got into scuffles with them.

As police reinforcement were called in, the hawkers dispersed. Police booked 14 people, including the leader of the group, Rakesh Maheriya, and six women.

“Two of our policemen suffered minor injuries. We have booked 14 persons under Sections 186, 323, 332, 143, 147 and 149 of the IPC,” said a police official.

GANDHINAGAR: The state government has asked the central government to request US to set up a consulate in Gujarat .

This has been a long pending demand of the state considering the high number of Gujaratis settled in the US.

Gujaratis are one of the largest sub-groups of the Indian diaspora in the US and large numbers of people from the state who are seeking US visas currently have to travel to Mumbai.

A senior official in the state government said that although the Gujarat government is yet to receive formal instructions from Centre about President Trump’s Gujarat visit, security, logistics and other preparations for it have begun. “The state government requested the Centre to ask the US government to consider the long-pending demand of the Gujarati community for a US consulate and visa centre in Ahmedabad or Gandhinagar , so residents of Gujarat do not have to travel to Mumbai for visas.”

The official added that a large number of visa applicants are senior citizens who visit the US often to meet family members.

“If Gujarat gets a consulate and visa centre, it will also boost support for the Trump administration among the Gujarati diaspora,” the source said.

The US presently has consulates in New Delhi, Chennai, Hyderabad, Kolkata and Mumbai. Applicants for US visa aspirants from Gujarat, Diu, Daman and Dadra and Nagar Haveli have to travel to Mumbai.

Prafull Nayak, president (India), Association of Indian Americans in the North America (AIANA) said, “The Gujarati community in the US has always been in support of the Trump administration. President Trump’s family had extended its support to organizing the ‘Chalo Gujarat’ event when it was first started in 2008.”

He added that the Gujarati community – both in India and in the US – have been requesting the US government to open a consulate and visa centre either in Ahmedabad or Gandhinagar.

“A number of investors from US regularly visit Gujarat and the people of Gujarat have also been exploring business opportunities in the US. If such a facility comes up in Gujarat, it will be a win-win situation for both parties,” he said.

AIANA had earlier taken up a signature campaign, seeking a US consulate in Gujarat, which was endorsed by more than 8,000 Gujaratis living in the US.

“We request the Centre to take up the issue with President Trump during his Ahmedabad and India visit. It will further cement ties between the two countries,’’ Nayak added.

Of the four major projects under construction, at least three are slated to be completed in 2020. In his budget speech on Thursday, the finance minister said the South Goa district hospital will be linked to a medical college to be operated on private public partnership (PPP) mode.

He said health infrastructure will also be strengthened. Under the National Ayush Mission, he said that an Ayush mental healthcare clinic will be set up.

He also proposed to construct a hostel to accommodate postgraduate dental students of Goa Dental College and Hospital, as also an MPhil in clinical psychology from the next academic year.

The chief minister did not announce any new big project for public health.

The budget provision for the sector also did not see a major jump with a provision of Rs 822 crore. This is Rs 53 crore more vis-a-vis Rs 769 crore in 2019-20.

The super-specialty block which is nearing completion, and the cancer research centre, are partly funded by the Centre. Other projects which are under way are funded by the state.

Meerut: District administration has directed all clay brick kiln owners to mix 25% fly ash in brick manufacturing and also erect a six-foot-tall tin sheet fence around the kiln facility. They have been warned that if the steps are not taken, the facilities will be shut down.

Additional district magistrate (finance) Subhash Chand Prajapati said, “We have given strict instructions to all brick kiln manufacturers to either follow rules or shut down their establishment.”

Prajapati said the steps were being taken in accordance with the directions of Allahabad high court. “The direction is in connection with a HC order on a PIL filed way back in 2014. The HC eventually ordered on January 23, 2020 that unless the above mentioned provisions are not fulfilled, no kiln should be allowed to manufacture bricks.”

Brick kiln owners, on the other hand, claimed that the group which filed the PIL believes in blackmailing tactics and misled the court to obtain orders in its favour.

CP Singh, president of the district brick kiln association, told TOI, “We will challenge the order in the HC because of the half-baked information provided by the petitioners. First of all, fly ash is made available by the thermal power plants. And these plants had already made it clear way back in 2010 that they do not have fly ash available in adequate quantity for brick kilns, which means the HC order in the current status amounts to sounding death knell for brick kiln industry.”

Environmental activist and lawyer Gaurav Bansal has rejected the claims of the brick kiln industry. “There is no dearth of fly ash in and around these thermal power plants but the problem is that already established clay brick kilns are not in the vicinity of these plants, so the transportation cost of fly ash from plant to kiln is quite high. On the contrary, clay is easily available. So the brick manufactures shy away from using fly ash.”

Fly ash is a by-product of coal after it is burnt at thermal power plants. There has been quite a push to promote its usage in brick manufacturing as thermal plants dump this ash on empty land or ponds, leading to depletion in top soil and raising pollution levels in the atmosphere. But inconsistent supply of this ash to brick kilns is matter of concern.

PANAJI: The cabinet on Thursday approved an additional 2.4 lakh sqm of land at Melaulim-Gulelim in Sattari for the establishment of the Indian Institute of Technology IIT).

The land, which will be transferred free of cost, is in addition to the 10 lakh sqm already allotted for the campus.

The cabinet, however, declined to grant another 3.6 lakh sqm of land. Instead, it has permitted an increase in floor area ratio (FAR) for the construction, calling the IIT a special project.

Approval has also been granted for an access road to the site. A single-lane road from the Guleli high school to the Sateri temple will be converted into a two-lane road.

This, as well as work of laying a drinking water pipeline to the site, will be undertaken by the public works department (PWD) at its own cost.

The Union human resource development ministry (MHRD) had asked the state government to consider allotting additional land, adjoining the 240 acres inspected earlier.

The site selection committee had inspected the 240-acre site at Melaulim-Gulelim, for which the ministry had given conditional approval. The state had previously attempted to acquire land in Cortali in Sanguem and Nagvem in Quepem . However, as parts of this land was privately-owned, the state was facing a challenge in convincing locals to part with their property.

The land now earmarked in Sattari taluka is being viewed as a safe option as it belongs to the state revenue department.

The land requirement to set up the permanent IIT campus was originally 500 acres. Given the state’s limited land resources, former CM Manohar Parrikar had clarified that only around 300 acres would be allocated. IIT Goa currently functions out of the Goa College of Engineering at Farmagudi.

Goa’s famed Feni is heading for a high of a different kind with the state government increasing the excise duty on the locally-crafted fruity brew from Rs 100 to Rs 155 per litre.

The heritage liquor, which is popular among locals and gaining traction abroad, is set to witness a significant increase in its retail prices as dealers will have no choice but to pass on the excise duty hike to tipplers.

The hike in excise duty is effective on all country liquor that is priced between Rs 110 to Rs 500 for a 750ml bottle. Feni got a geographical indication (GI) as well as the heritage tag to boost sales. tnn

213,['7/02/2020'],Metro completion delayed by three months,"This story is from February 7, 2020

Nagpur: There will be a slight delay in completion of Nagpur Metro project as the deadline has been extended till March 2021 against the earlier one of December 2020. MahaMetro officials ascribed various reasons for the delay. Reach I (Sitabuldi to Khapri) and Reach III (Sitabuldi to Lokmanya Nagar) are already operational although half the stations are yet to be opened.

A Metro official said that both Reach II (Sitabuldi to Automotive Square stretch) and Reach IV (Sitabuldi to Prajapati Nagar stretch) would be completed by March 2021. These deadlines have been submitted to Prime Minister’s office (PMO) and chief minister’s office (CMO). Earlier, Reach IV was to be completed first and Reach II was the last.

Elaborating on the status of Reach IV, the official said, “Work of viaduct is 82% complete. All the 1,284 piles, 250 pile caps, 45 pier arms, 44 track arms and 2,393 segment casting have been completed. 245 piers out of 266, 221 pier caps out of 232, 5 out of 35 portals 2,266 segment erection out of 2,393, 217 out of 259 span erections and 232 out of 250 crash barrier fixing have been completed.”

Metro track has been laid on 4 kilometre out of the total 8.5km. Overhead electrical poles will be erected after track laying is completed.

On Reach II, he said, “207 out of 221 pile caps, 188 out of 221 piers up to Metro level, 181 out of 221 pier caps up to Metro level, 124 spans out of 220, 994 out of 1,655 spine casting and 75 out of 160 spine launching have been completed. Wing casting and launching has also started. Track has been laid on 1km.”

MahaMetro may have set a deadline of March 2021 but Nagpurians may not be able to use Metro on these stretches from April 2021 if experience of Reach III is anything to go by. Reach III had been completed in September 2019 but was opened for traffic in January 2020 as MahaMetro could not get the appointment of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and chief minister Uddhav Thackeray. Finally both didn’t come to Nagpur and the CM inaugurated it through video link.

Kolhapur: Monday’s mayoral election is expected to have a straight contest between Nilofer Ajarekar of Congress-NCP and BJP-Tararani Aaghadi’s Archana Pagar . Ajarekar and Pagar filed their nomination papers on Thursday.

Kolhapur is all set to have another mayor after four months as per a Congress decision. NCP’s Surmanjiri Latkar resigned from the post a few days back to pave the way for a Congress mayor as per the understanding between the two parties. Sources in Congress said the party has decided to give an opportunity to another corporator before November this year when the civic election will be held. Congress has decided to give a chance to a corporator from Kolhapur South and Kolhapur North following pressure from members.

Nilofer Ajarekar is from Kolhapur North. Sources said that another corporator from Kolhapur South will be given opportunity after four months. Ajarekar has been asked to resign after four months, they said. Sources added that district guardian minister Satej Patil was of the view that one corporator should hold the mayoral post for the remaining nine-month period. However, he had to succumb to pressure from corporators. Apart from Ajarekar, Jayshree Chavan and Uma Banchhode were strong contenders. From Kolhapur South, Deepa Magdum and Indumati Mane were aspirants. Satej Patil had conducted separate interviews of all the aspirants before finalizing the candidate. Sharandhar Deshmukh announced the candidature of Ajarekar in the noon after which nomination papers were filed.

BJP-Tararani Aaghadi finalized Pagar’s name after a meeting of local leaders.

MUZAFFARNAGAR: In a freak accident, a one-year-old baby died after hanging from the thread tied around his neck for good luck which actually got entangled in his pram when he fell down with no parents to check on him on Thursday morning. The parents later took the child to a hospital, where he was declared dead.

The incident occurred at Garhi Daulat village of Kandhla police station in Shamli when parents left their one-year-old son unattended for a while and went to the terrace. When they returned to check their child, he was found unconscious hanging from the pram.

The baby’s father, who is a labourer, said, “He was sleeping in a pram. I don’t know how he fell and got entangled in his pram.”

Notably, a similar incident occurred in Shamli district last year. A five-year-old boy drowned after he accidentally fell into a temporarily dug tank in an under-construction building. The incident took place at Noorani colony under Sadar Kotwali . By the time his body was found, he was already dead. Sources said, the boy was playing outside the under-construction building and suddenly fell into the tank.

In another such incident in Muzaffarnagar last June, a seven-year-old boy had accidentally locked himself inside a car while he was on way to a local madrassa. Unable to come out, the boy was found dead a few hours later probably due to suffocation. The incident took place at Sikri village of Muzaffarnagar’s Bhopa region.

Visakhapatnam: Fair price shop dealers will soon become mere stockists as from April onwards, as volunteers and secretaries will distribute essential stock to the general public. In all, there are over 29,000 fair price shop dealers catering to an average of 500 card holders each.

The state government’s proposal to use the fair price shop dealers as stockists has them worrying for their future as they believe their days are numbered. The dealers’ association is pleading with the government to provide them a monthly allowance that would help them tide over their losses.

“The government proposes to provide us Rs 1 per kilo of essentials distributed. This sum is a pittance as it averages to roughly Rs 7,000 for the seven tonnes of essentials that we disburse every month, averaging to 14 kilos per card (taking into account the average three individuals per card). Out of this amount, as stockists we have to pay our staff, stock room rent and electricity bills. This is nothing but shoving us into losses,” said P Chitti Raju, general secretary of the fair price shop dealers association.

In lieu of the losses they will incur, the members of the association have demanded a compensatory sum of Rs 12,000 for rural dealers, Rs 15,000 for dealers in municipalities and Rs 18,000 for dealers in corporations. M Venkata Rao, the president of the association, said, “We understand that as stockists our role will merely be that of safe-keepers of the stock. Keeping this in mind, we are asking for a reasonable sum as monthly allowance.”

The dealers pointed out that the government’s move would be a fatal blow, keeping in mind the sheer number of dealers in the state. They added that the introduction of the EPoS (E-Point of Distribution System) has made the PDS (public distribution system) by far the best in the country and handing over stock distribution to volunteers could actually prove to be regressive.

PANAJI: The state cabinet on Thursday extended the September 2020 deadline that was set for the completion of greenfield international airport at Mopa by 20 months, owing to delays caused by litigations.

A senior government officer said that as per the new deadline, the infrastructure at the airport will have to be completed by December 2021 and the operations would begin by May-end, 2022.

He said that it takes at least six months to get permission and clearances from all the authorities to start operations after the infrastructure is in place.

The government had signed the concession agreement with GMR Goa for developing the airport on a public-private partnership basis on November 8, 2016.

The three-year construction period of phase I began from September 4, 2017 with the commercial operations date fixed on September 3, 2020.

The state government had appointed Engineers India Ltd, a government of India entity, to supervise the project’s progress.

The project faced constraints on felling of trees and a 365-day stay on construction by the apex court against the environmental clearance (EC) granted by the ministry of environment, forest and climate change.

The Supreme Court on January 16, 2020 had upheld the environment clearance and allowed the construction work to resume.

“The concessionaire has sought 634 days extension for commissioning of the phase I with corresponding extension in concession period and time for payment of annual premium,” states the cabinet note.

It said that although there was a stay over felling of trees for 167 days, there was no stay on the project. But, the pace of construction slowed down considerably.

“The overall progress achieved during the period of stay on tree felling was 5.3 per cent as against a planned progress of 10.9 per cent,” it said.

ANI photo

NEW DELHI: Expressing concern at the Supreme Court’s recent observation over the time taken by presiding officers (Speakers) to decide on the disqualification of defected law makers, Union law minister Ravi Shankar Prasad on Thursday said the apex court’s “comments were avoidable”. He said, “With the greatest respect to the honourable Supreme Court, those sweeping comments against the presiding officers, were surely avoidable. We need to have institutional respect for all the institutions of the country. The presiding officers of the legislatures are equally important functionaries in the constitutional process. I must place it on record.”

Congress leader Anand Sharma also supported the minister’s observation say ing, “We should take note of it. I agree with the honourable law minister on this. This is a serious matter. It is a transgression. The Constitution is clear in its scheme of things and the division of powers.” The apex court while hearing a plea on disqualification of 17 MLAs in Karnataka had ruled limiting the time-frame within which the presiding officers — the Speaker or Chairperson — can decide disqualification petitions. It had observed that presiding officers also belong to some political party. Prasad and Sharma’s observation came soon after Rajya Sabha Chairman M Venkaiah Naidu asked the government to find a solution to the “nuisance and unethical” practice of defection of elected political representatives from parent parties to others.

Naidu made the suggestion after DMK MP P Wilson raised the issue of defection during Zero Hour. “Unfortunately, people are saying now it’s not defection, it’s only affection and they are doing it with perfection. We must put an end to this. It is a very im portant issue across the country. Cutting across party lines, we must come forward to suggest some alternative to end this nuisance or nonsense or unethical acts of defection,” Naidu said.

He also said that everybody was taking time to decide on this issue whether presiding officers or courts. Recently, a conference of presiding officers of Parliament and state assemblies was held. The 10th schedule to the Indian Constitution, which is also popularly referred to as the anti-defection law, was discussed at length on the concluding day of the conference.

The discussion on the 10th Schedule assumes importance in the wake of the Supreme Court’s observation about a growing trend of Speakers of legislative bodies acting against the constitutional duty of being neutral.

KOLHAPUR: A 50-year-old biker was killed on Tuesday when he hit a parked tractor trailer laden with sugar cane along a road in Appachi wadi, around 40 km south of the city.

This is the third accident this season in which a sugar cane vehicle has been found involved.

Steven Alvares, the regional transport officer, Kolhapur , told TOI that his office will wait for the police investigation to conclude before deciding who was at fault. “Prima facie, it seems like the sugar cane vehicle was at fault. But we do not want to make any assumptions at this stage. We will have to know if the biker was following rules,” Alvares said.

On January 24, two people were killed when the Omni they were traveling in — carrying six members of a family — rammed into a sugar cane trailer in the same Appachi wadi area. At the time, the officials at the regional transport office had said that they would launch road safety awareness campaigns among sugar cane trailer drivers, who have been accused of negligence. Every year, there are fatal accidents involving vehicles ferrying raw sugar cane to the mills, especially along the highway stretches through Pune, Solapur, Nashik and Ahmednagar. The vehicles usually don’t have any rear lights and are often overloaded, with produce dangerously sticking out of the cargo bays. The tail lights in most instances are covered by the sugar cane stems.

Alvares said the mills in the region had already been informed that they would be held responsible if sugar cane vehicles were found to have caused accidents.

“We have held workshops across the district with sugar mill owners and farmers. We are also carrying our regular patrolling,” he said.

Earlier in 2019, Alvares had said that as many as 4,535 vehicles were inspected for the reflector violation from April 1 to November 30, of which, 907 were found to be non-compliant. A fine of Rs 6.81 lakh was collected from the violators. He had then said that the authorities had planned an enforcement drive across the district to identify the violators and impose fines on them.

224,['7/02/2020'],"11 tigers using NH-7 underpasses, says WII report","This story is from February 7, 2020

Nagpur: At a time insufficient mitigation measures on NH-44 (NH-7) near Pench Tiger Reserve have come in for criticism, a report by Wildlife Institute of India (WII), Dehradun, claims 11 individuals tigers are using six of the nine wildlife underpasses.

The report, based on one-year camera trap survey data from March-December 2019, states that 18 wild animal species, excluding rhesus macaque and grey langur, were found using these underpasses. Over 5,450 wild animal captures were recorded on camera traps in 10 months.

NH-7 has been in the news for frequent wild animal deaths. In the latest, a leopard was knocked dead on January 24 near Deolapar. In the last 15 months, three leopards have been killed, and a tiger was recorded jumping over the crash barrier to cross towards Pench Tiger Reserve.

As per the WII report, apart from tigers and leopards, spotted deer, wild boars and wild dogs were the most frequent users of these underpasses. The other animals included jungle cat, mongoose, common palm civet, small Indian civet, Indian hare, rusty spotted cat, and porcupine.

“Till December 31, 89 tiger crossings have been recorded under the mitigation structures. These crossings correspond to 11 individual tigers, that are also regular users of the underpasses,” the report says.

The NH-7 is the longest highway of India, and is part of the north-south corridor connecting Srinagar to Kanyakumari. Along its course, it connects several important urban and rural centres of economic importance. It also cuts across important animal corridors along its route.

Along a 16.1km length of the NH-7 passing through forests adjoining Pench Tiger Reserve and intersecting the Pench-Navegaon-Nagzira tiger corridor, nine wildlife mitigation structures were constructed as proposed in the WII-NTCA joint report in May 2015.

“The initial results from monitoring of mitigation measures on NH-7 are very promising. We have reported 5,381 captures of 18 wild animal species from these underpasses, of which jungle cat, hare, chital, wild pig, wild dog and tiger were found to use these structures most frequently,” said tiger scientist Bilal Habib, who suggested the mitigation measures.

Habib added, “Moreover, 11 tiger individuals are using these structures regularly. The monitoring exercise has shown that these crossing structures are contributing to enhancing the permeability of the landscape. Such mitigation measures, if adopted, would help defragment fragmented landscapes.”

“Learnings from our monitoring exercise can help guide implementation of such mitigation measures in highways passing through ecologically-sensitive habitats across India to make them permeable for wildlife. These findings also add new dimensions to the debate of conservation versus development,” Habib said.

“Habituation to the crossing structures and frequency of captures would vary with local abundance and behaviour of different species. This is reflected by the time they were first captured using the structures and the frequency with which they use the structures,” he explains.

According to the findings, tiger, spotted deer, wild boars, hare and jungle cat were among the first species to be captured under the structures and are regularly captured. Leopard, sloth bear and rusty spotted cat were captured much later during the monitoring.

Tigers have been regularly using six of the 9 underpasses that range from 80 metres to 750 metres in width. Three individuals were also recorded crossing a box culvert of 7 metres width. In addition to crossing the structures, tigers were also observed walking under the structures on 23 occasions.

KOLKATA: One of the two youths, members of two prominent Kolkata business families, who were arrested for allegedly extorting money from women after threatening to make public intimate moments captured with them on video, has been slapped with stringent Pocso sections.

The accused Anish Loharuka’s family runs a hotel chain in the city and he was arrested with Aditya Aggarwal whose family owns an ethnic-wear retail chain. They were the main accused of the case and produced in court on Thursday. Both of them were remanded in six-day police custody .

“We have ample evidence to show that the main complainant’s video was made while she was still a minor. Hence, we consulted our legal team and decided to slap the Pocso charges against Loharuka,” sources said.

Public prosecutor Tamal Mukherjee said interrogation of the two was necessary as their medical tests would be carried out. He informed the court that several videos were still being recovered from the duo. The third accused, Kailash Yadav, a cook of Loharuka, will be produced in court on Friday.

However, defence lawyers argued that the accused had not circulated the video themselves. “He had taken the video with the complainant’s full consent when they were in a relationship. It was the other accused who used it for ulterior motives,” said a lawyer who appeared for Aggarwal.

Earlier, six women lodged complaints against the two while the police contacted with three of them. Two of the complainants who are married have told the police that they had been in a relationship with one of the two accused almost six years ago when both the victim and the accused were minors. One of the women said she had no clue about how the videos of her intimate moments were recorded by the accused.

The chief minister said resumption of mining and allied activities is the priority of the budget.

PANAJI: While listing the five steps taken by the state government to restart mining activities, chief minister Pramod Sawant, who is also the finance minister, projected Rs 500 crore revenue from the sector for the financial year 2020-2021 in the budget.

The chief minister said resumption of mining and allied activities is the priority of the budget. “Yes we have considered Rs 500 crore revenue from the mining sector. Definitely it will be more than that,” Sawant told reporters after presenting the budget.

Stating that the government has left no stone unturned to restart mining in the state, he said, in the interim, the Supreme Court decision to allow export and transportation of royalty paid iron ore extracted before March 15, 2018, has provided much relief to mining dependants.

He said the state government took five steps to restart mining, including filing of review petition against the Supreme Court’s February 7, 2018, order quashing second renewal of 88 mining leases, filing of interlocutory application for handling dumps, getting permission to allow exports for royalty paid ore, looking for alternative to resume mining and e-auctioning of iron ore.

“Restarting mining will help the government provide employment in the sector,” he said, adding that, precaution would be taken to protect the environment.

The state government will allow mining of major and minor minerals, including sand extraction, without violating environmental laws, he said.

Representative image

VISAKHAPATNAM: With the announcement of budget allocations in the railway ministry’s pink book, it is clear that the ministry is keen on speeding up the works on the South Coast Railway ( SCoR ) zone .

With Visakhapatnam as the headquarters of SCoR, officials here are preparing to initiate works related to the zonal headquarters, like creation of office space, residential quarters for both officers and staff, welfare infrastructure such as hospitals and recreational facilities.

As per the detail project report (DPR) submitted by the officer on special duty earlier, at least Rs 111 crore would be required to develop the headquarters. “The ministry sanctioned Rs 170 crore for SCoR in the budget announced recently. The works would hopefully begin soon,” said a senior railway officer to TOI.

As per the norms for different grades of officers and staff as stipulated in the Railway Board’s letter number 5720, dated August 12, 1976, a general manager cadre officer must have office space of 60 square meters while lower-level cadre officers, like Group C, must have six meters of office space.

“The total office space needed to house 170 officers and 1,080 group C staff is 11,105 square meters. Since the existing divisional office has a plinth area of 11,536 square meters, there would be no big exercise involved in creating office space,” the railway officer said, while adding that the existing Waltair division office can readily be used to cater to the immediate requirements of the new zonal headquarters.

The expected staff and officer strength for the headquarters will be around 3,000. Since nearly 1,800 staff already works at the Waltair division, there would be no need to transfer incumbent staff to other places, except the junior staff depending on the requirement of the newly-formed Rayagada division or SCoR, the railway officials said.

S Jayakumar

CHENNAI: Prime suspect and brain behind the TNPSC examination scam surrendered before a Saidapet court on Thursday. The CB-CID, probing the alleged malpractice, had been hunting for S Jayakumar, 45, for the last two weeks even as investigators arrested 32 people in connection with scams in the 2019 Group IV exam and the 2017 Group II-A exam.

The 23rd metropolitan magistrate court directed that Jayakumar be remanded till Friday and be produced before the CB-CID court in Egmore on that day. CB-CID investigators are expected to take him into custody for detailed questioning. Police constable Sithandi and Jayakumar are the main suspects in the scam.

Police circulated his photographs at airports, major railway stations and bus terminals to prevent Jayakumar from escaping to another state or country. A week ago, police, who suspected Jayakumar’s role in both scams, conducted searches at his Mogappair house and seized a laptop, pen drive and more than 60 special ink pens apart from documents. Police also found that Sithandi, who was arrested from Sivaganga, had collected Rs 82.5 lakh from seven job aspirants who cleared the 2017 group II-A exam and were selected for government jobs then. Meanwhile, the CB-CID has taken accused Omkanthan into five days police custody in connection with the TNPSC Group IV exam scam. Omkanthan was assigned to assist TNPSC staff Manickavel in transporting the answer sheets from Rameswaram to Chennai. Around 8 pm on September 1, 2019, after loading the answer sheets in a van, Omkanthan kept the key with him. Jayakumar followed the van in another vehicle.

Meanwhile, with the detention of a VAO, recruited in 2016 through TNPSC exam, for suspected job fraud, the CB-CID suspect malpractices in the VAO test held then. The VAO allegedly gave Rs 15 lakh to Jayakumar to get selected. Five others, who were selected as VAOs after writing the exam in February 2016, are also under the scanner.

KOLHAPUR: The security at Kalamba jail has again come under the scanner after two mobile phones and four batteries were recovered within the premises recently.

A surprise check by the officials of Kalamba Central Prison led to the recovery of the items that are not permitted in the jail premises. The security officials found the phones and the batteries buried under the ground near a latrine in circle number 9 of the jail premises. A case has been registered against the unidentified persons with the Juna Rajwada police station.

Jail superintendent Sharad Shelke took charge of the prison on Wednesday after returning from a training and issued orders to launch a search operation.

“We have issued instructions to the jail staff to check the CCTV footage and other sources to find out who are the owners of these mobile phones and how they managed to get these phones inside the jail premises,” said an official from Kalamba jail.

“We suspect that the prisoners get their hands on the phones from their relatives during their visits to the civil hospital for routine check-up. We have initiated a strict watch at the entrance gate of the jail and will ensure that such material does not enter into the jail premises,” he said.

Two months ago, when Shelke had gone for training, the jail officials found a mobile phone that had been abandoned in the premises. A case has been registered in this regard too with the Juna Rajwada police station.

The issue of security in and around Kalamba jail has surfaced several times in last few years. In November 2015, two jail superintendents from Kalamba Central prison were suspended after the video of merrymaking at the Kalamba jail went viral. The video showed five jail inmates cooking food, eating dry fruits and allegedly smoking marijuana in the jail.

In 2018, a clip was posted on social media that showed a prisoner holding a pistol made of cardboard in his barrack in Kalamba jail.

KOLHAPUR: The co-operative department has asked the police department to register cases against two out of seven private moneylenders whose homes were raided last month in Panhala taluka . The two were found lending money without valid licences.

According to the police officials, the co-operative department had raided the homes of seven people from Kotoli village in Panhala taluka after it received complaints that alleged that they were operating as private money lenders .

Officials had seized several documents, including stamp papers, agreements and other material. The officials stated they have finished the scrutiny of documents seized from two of the seven persons and have issued instructions to the police to take action.

The raid followed several complaints from people who have alleged harassment from private money lenders in the region who charge high interest rates and often resort to illegal tactics to recover the money. Two months ago, homes of 16 private money lenders were raided by officials who also recovered Rs 25 lakh in cash from them.

As per the data available with the cooperative department, there are only 255 money lenders in the region who have valid licences to operate.

Kolhapur police have also registered cases against two private money lenders. One complaint was registered with the Ichalkaranji police station and other complaint is with the Jaysingpur police station.

The two lenders have been booked under several sections of the IPC and relevant sections of the Maharashtra Moneylending Act.

Superintendent of police Abhinav Deshmukh has urged citizens to register complaints if they have information on people operating as money lenders without a licence or if they charge high interest rates.

KOLKATA: A week before the commissioning of the first phase of the East-West Metro , power connection to the third rail has been switched off so that the 5km stretch on the elevated viaduct could be inspected. East-West Metro’s first phase will be unveiled on February 13.Officials said this would be the last daylight inspection of the section. After that track inspections would be possible only at night, once the rakes are back in the stabling yard. “ Therefore, the daylight inspection is crucial. All kinds of issues can be detected best in daylight,” an official said.“The power connection to the third rail will be switched on again on Sunday. By then, inspection crew will check every inch of the tracks so that a seamless commissioning can take place next Thursday,” the official added.Early on Thursday, inspection teams walked along the viaduct from Sector V to Salt Lake Stadium to check for water leaks, switch gears, pathway, lighting, earthing, cables and all other parameters to ensure glitch-free services. This is the first time since the trials began on July 4, 2018, that the tracks will be without power for 36 hours at a stretch.This will also be the last time that the tracks will go without power for so many hours. “Since train services can’t be suspended for so long again, this is our last chance check every issue along the tracks,” an engineer said.

The AMTZ ( Med Tech Zone ) in Visakhapatnam houses the Bio-Valley, where a number of start-ups are working on products which could help redefine the nutraceutical industry both in India and abroad. The products range from those tailor-made for India specific cancer patients to nano extracts and particles from Ayurvedic herbs.

Srivatava noted that over the last couple of years a few start-ups have done some original research in producing products and devices that would go a long way in the international market. In fact he said, “Some of these products are going to make waves in the international market.”

Elaborating on some of the key products developed here at Bio-Valley in Visakhapatnam, Srivatava said, “As of now there are three products that will be runaway products and will soon become global products. We have produced the world’s first Indian Gut specific nutrition product for cancer patients. This powder was developed by Asperer and it is already being tested by the British NHS ( National Health Services) so that it can be approved for all hospitals in the UK.” Srivastava expressed happiness that the Bio-Valley was making bold strides to help Vizag become a leader in nutraceuticals.

PANAJI: While chief minister Pramod Sawant presented a modest and no-frills budget on Thursday, the political connotations of the exercise was not lost on political observers.

Political analysts were quick to point out that Sawant, while attempting to woo zilla panchayat members, clearly with an eye on the elections to the second tier panchayat bodies to be held on March 15, has also tried to please municipal bodies elections to which are due later this year.

While proposing to empower ZPs in both districts, Sawant spoke about plans to “extend recommendatory powers to ZP members for carrying out certain priority works within their jurisdictions. Also, members will be mandatory special invitees to the village gram sabhas, the chief minister said.

Sawant has also attempted to keep his flock in good humour by promising major development projects. Mapusa MLA Joshua D’Souza, Pernem MLA Manohar Azgaokar and Sanguem independent MLA Prasad Gaonkar stand to gain a ‘Kala Bhavan’ each while the Kala mandir at Cortalim—represented BJP legislator Alina Saldanha— will be operational soon.

By proposing to introduce Dugdhgram scheme to promote dairy farming in Cuncolim and Canacona, both represented by neo-saffronite MLAs Clafacio Dias and Isidore Fernandes, apart from one in Sal in the chief minister’s home constituency, Sawant has done a balancing act.

Our staff are in touch with them over phone. They have been told to contact health inspectors or village health nurses if they have symptoms of fever, sore throat, cold or breathing difficulty. If they call private hospitals, doctors there should direct them to government hospitals. If they land at their hospitals, we should be notified so we can pick them,” said Dr P Sampath, public health joint director of public health (epidemic control), after the meeting.The intention is to ensure the virus does not spread within the community. “We don’t have much information about the virus now. We don’t want any risk of suspected cases being exposed to the general public. At least four private hospitals said they have exclusive quarantine facilities, but we denied them permission,” he said.

KOLKATA: Health officials at the airport are now trying to trace the co-passengers of the three confirmed victims of the virus in India who had travelled via Kolkata. The details of all the co-passengers will be handed over to the respective state government authorities.The primary job of the health officials is to put passengers arriving from China, Hong Kong, Singapore and Thailand through thermal screening to detect symptoms of novel coronavirus (nCoV). The additional job was tasked upon Airport Health Organization (APHO) — that operates under the Union ministry of health — last week after it was found that all three confirmed patients affected by novel coronavirus had come to Kolkata, before taking a domestic flight to Kochi in Kerala. While the first two patients had taken China Eastern Airlines flight from Kunming to Kolkata on January 23, the other person — who was diagnosed three days ago — had landed in Kolkata by an IndiGo flight from Guangzhou on January 25.“All the passengers on the flight as well as the crew members are susceptible to the infection now as the three patients were silent carriers of the disease and had developed symptoms only after reaching their homes. Our task is to track down all the flyers on the China-Kolkata and the Kolkata-Kochi flights and inform the Centre and the state governments concerned. It is the task of the state governments to get them quarantined and tested,” a senior official at the Kolkata airport said.The official said that to complete the task, they were working with the airlines to find out the seat numbers of all the flyers to find out their approximate distance from the confirmed patients while travelling on the flight. They will also check the CCTV footage at the airport to find out the distance their co-passengers maintained at the queues for immigration check and thermal screening.“Focus will be on those with a history of visits to Wuhan in China. We are also making a list of all the passengers screened so far. It’s a hectic and extremely time consuming process,” said another official.Meanwhile, based on the report sent by the APHO, the Bengal health department has traced a woman in Behala who visited Wuhan last month. “We have asked her to come to the hospital for tests,” a health official.Another airport official said every day the health officers are screening around 1,500 passengers from 12-15 flights.

240,['7/02/2020'],"Medaram Jatara, Telangana’s Kumbh Mela, to see 1.5 crore pilgrims in four days","This story is from February 7, 2020

A massive congregation of over one crore people assemble in Medaram

MEDARAM: The religious jamboree at Medaram is south India’s answer to the Kumbh Mela held in north India. A massive congregation of over one crore people assemble in Medaram, a remote village in Telangana ’s Mulugu district every two years to fete goddesses -- Sammakka and Sarakka -- in what is now billed as Asia’s biggest tribal festival.

From the central festival area where the main deities are kept under a tree, it’s a sea of humanity stretching up to 7 km spread across over 300 acres of farmland nestled amid hillocks. Lakhs of people marching onto the banks of Jampanna Vagu, a small rivulet in the village, to celebrate the jatara is a sight to behold.

The jatara is held during the Magha Shuddha Pournami period to celebrate the valour of a tribal woman, Sammakka and her daughter Sarakka who took on the mighty Kakatiya dynasty over an unfair tax regime.

Chenchus, Gonds, Gothikoyas, Adivasis, Lambadas, Koyas, Nayakpods, Banjara Girijans, Muriyas, Mariyas, Dhurves and Rajagonds are some of the tribal sects who throng the jatara. In the last few years, domination of non-tribals has robbed the jatara some of its sheen. “It’s sad to see the management of the historic tribal festival falling into the hands of non-tribals,” complains former Mahabubabad MP A Seetaram Naik.

This spectacle of faith attracts not only people from Andhra Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Odisha, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu but also from Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra and Jharkhand. “People have unflinching faith in the sublime powers of Samakka and Sarakka,” explains tribal priest Mahesh.

On the road leading to this nondescript village, cars jostle for space alongside bullock carts, overcrowded buses and tractors. Official estimates put the number of visitors for the four-day carnival (held between February 5-8 this year) at close to 1.5 crore.

The observances begin with the arrival of deities (in the form of a vermilion-filled casket and a bamboo pole) of Sarakka from Kannepalle hillock. The deity of Sammakka joins her from another hillock, Chilakalagutta. “The celebration of their valour combined with their mystical powers has earned Medaram the sobriquet of a maha jatara in the Deccan plateau, next only to the Kumbh Mela,” says retired professor of National Institute of Technology, Warangal, M Pandu Ranga Rao.

As the mass of humanity advances towards the pedestals where the two deities converge, booming drumbeats entice pilgrims to dance in jubilation under colourful flags. Ardent devotees hurl fowl into the air as sacrificial offerings, while several others roll on the muddy road leading to the altar, allowing tribal priests to walk over them. Many pilgrims sprinkle the blood of animals in a show of reverence, sending a chill up the spines of first-timers to the festival.

Since the 13th century, Girijan and Koya tribals have been holding the jatara in memory of the two tribal women whom they revere as goddesses. “The jatara holds a mirror to the tribal customs, traditions and beliefs,” says tribals’ head priest Kokkera Narasaiah.

Decorated pandals and tents accommodate lakhs of people who gather to listen to soothsayers. Others get busy as they sacrifice goats & hens, cook meat and indulge in booze. Men dressed in exotic female costumes and colourful jewellery, apparently as per the goddesses’ wish!

Another prominent feature is the offering of ‘bangaram’ (jaggery).‘Siva Sattis’, women with turmeric-smeared bodies and matted hair, enter the waters in a tumult, blow conch shells and holler, “Jai Sarakka, Jai Jai Sammakka.”

While some devotees participate only on the day Sammakka is brought from the hillock, many others stay put in makeshift tents for four days. Surya Kumari, a housewife from Hyderabad, said, “It is spiritual magic at its best. In a country where mass congregations are common, the sheer size of the Medaram Jatara sets it apart from the rest.”

KOLHAPUR: Acting swiftly on a woman’s complaint, the Kolhapur police have arrested a 26-year-old man for allegedly harassing her and threatening her into accept his proposals.

The police are on alert about such complaints after a college teacher was set ablaze by a man in Hinganghat town of Wardha district .

The Kolhapur police received a complaint from the woman on Tuesday that the suspect had been harassing him for the past one year. The complainant works in a private firm in Kolhapur city. Around a year ago, the suspect spotted her and started following her. He tried to befriend with her but the complainant did not respond him.

She has told the police that the suspect would at times follow her from her workplace to her house. The complainant had told about him to her family members, who had told her to ignore him.

She told the police that the suspect obstructed her way recently when she was going home after her work and threatened her — telling her to accept his proposal. He also warned her of dire consequences if she turned him down. Scared of his threats, she rushed to the police and lodged a complaint against him.

The police have registered a case under section 354 (Assault or criminal force to woman with intent to outrage her modesty) and 504 (Intentional insult with intent to provoke breach of the peace) against him. He was produced before a local court and was remanded in magistrates’ custody.

Sunil Patil, inspector in-charge of the police station where the case has been registered, said, “We took immediate action case as there was a threat to the life of the complainant and it was important to act immediately. We have produced him before a local court on Wednesday and the court sent him to magistrate’s custody,” he said.

He added that the police were gathering evidence to build a strong case against the suspect, to ensure a conviction.

The Kolhapur police have taken several initiatives for the security of women and girl students. They have deployed special ‘Nirbhaya’ squads too tackle incidents of eve-teasing, stalking and harassment of women. The police have appealed to women and girls to come forward and register complaint if they are facing any such problems.

Deputy superintendent of police Prashant Amrutkar said, “Our Nirbhaya squad and the respective police stations will immediately take action on their complaints and address their issues. If this complainant had approached us one year back, when she noticed the suspect following and harassing her, we would have initiated action against him then itself.”

COIMBATORE: The Coimbatore Medical College Hospital , the tertiary care hospital for the entire western region, says they have a 10% shortage of doctors and an immeasurable shortage of nurses. The hospital’s performance in critical surgeries like organ transplants has been affected by the absence of enough nephrologists and neurologists.

According to the hospital records, 35 posts of specialist doctors are vacant, while it is short of around 90% “required” nursing staff. A senior official with the health services department said, “As per the Mudaliar committee recommendations, we need 1,200 staff nurses. But we have only around 10% of that strength.”

Pointing out that CMCH has only two nephrologists and a urologist in the transplant team, the official said, “The hospital has been sanctioned two more nephrologists, but the case is in court,” A few doctors have got a stay order from the court against the postings.

CMCH dean Dr B Ashokan, however, said they hadn’t so far turned away patients, citing shortage of doctors. “We have only three doctors in the renal transplant team. But we haven’t ever turned away any kidney failure patient in the outpatient department or denied them a bed.”

The hospital has performed just 24 renal transplants so far. But it is often compared with the Madras Medical College, which first did a transplant in 1996. “They have 10 professors and 12 assistant professors, while we have just two. Even the government hospital in Salem has more specialist doctors than what we have,” said a senior doctor.

The CMCH has placed around 60 patients in the waiting list of Transplant Authority of Tamil Nadu . Of them, 30 are active.

The health official said if the vacancies were filled, the hospital would be able to perform more renal transplants. “A transplant, especially a cadaver transplant, can’t be performed during the current shift timing of 9am to 2pm. There is only one nephrology professor and an assistant professor. They can only take a certain workload, as patients’ lives are at risk. If staff are available, we can have an assistant professor level doctor round the clock,” he said.

KOLKATA: The city saw one of best figures in room occupancy in a decade in the five-star and five-star deluxe categories over the last three months. Thanks to conferences, weddings and an effect of Biswa Bangla Convention Centre, the average room tariff also went up significantly during these months.The average room rent (ARR) in Kolkata went up from Rs 5,100 in 2018 to Rs 5,200 in 2019 despite the addition of nearly 509 rooms in the super deluxe category with the opening of ITC Royal Bengal.Over 500 rooms were also added in the business class category in the vicinity of the airport, including New Town. There were at least 20 days in November, December and January when the rooms at star properties were sold out. Sudesh Poddar, secretary of Hotel & Restaurant Association of Eastern India, told TOI that the winter quarter — September to December, extending up to January — was great for Kolkata hoteliers. “The occupancy during this time was as high as 85%-88% compared to the annual average of 65% in the city. The average room rent went up to Rs 8,500- Rs 9,000. The annual average is Rs 6,500.

It is now attracting lot of conferences. The average attendance in such conferences is over 2,000. So star category hotels are getting good businesses,” he added. According to him, Kolkata has also developed as a wedding destination over the last few years because it’s cheaper and offers good infrastructure and facilities.A top executive of another star hotel in the city said most of the big industrial families hail from Kolkata. In the last couple of decades, their major events, including weddings, have been held at hotels. “Weddings are a big business in Kolkata and sustains the hospitality industry. ,” he added.Atul Bhalla, regional head of ITC hotels, felt that Kolkata experienced buoyancy throughout December. “ITC Royal Bengal and ITC Sonar registered a growth of at least 77% in occupancy and average room tariff of over Rs 10,000.

HYDERABAD: Rising demand for agriculture as a career option among students has driven the Telangana government to set up more agricultural colleges in the state in the new academic year. Beginning AY2020-21, the Professor Jayashankar Telangana State Agricultural University ( PJTSAU ) will start a new constituent college in Adilabad, which will admit 60 students in its first batch.The insitute will offer BSc in agriculture, taking the total number of BSc in agriculture seats in Telangana to roughly 500. This institute will be in addition to six constituent colleges existing at Rajendranagar, Aswaraopet, Jagtial, Warangal, Palem and Sircilla. Currently, the intake for bachelor of science (BSc) in agriculture is close to 432 in addition to 200 seats in diploma, masters and research.Apart from this, plans are afoot to establish agriculture colleges in other districts too. “Due to increase in irrigation potential in Telangana and pro-agrarian policies, more number of graduates are coming forward to pursue a career in agriculture. In view of this, there is certainly a need to set-up more number of colleges to accommodate the demand for agriculture courses,” state agriculture minister Niranjan Reddy told TOI and added that a proposal in this regard will be submitted to chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao shortly. “If the CM approves, the colleges will be operational from academic year 2020-21 itself,” Reddy said.According to sources, a private agriculture university is also proposed near Siddipet. The state government has sent the proposal to the Indian Council of Agricultural Research, New Delhi for approval following which the university is expected to consider admissions in four year BSc (Hons) agriculture and BSc (Hons) horticulture courses.At present, close to 9,000 students travel to neighbouring states such as Maharashtra, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu every year to pursue undergraduate agriculture courses owing to insufficient number of seats in Telangana. “After pursuing BSc in agriculture, the plan is to apply in banks and government jobs.

Second additional district and sessions judge BS Rekha

KOLAR: A district and sessions judge in Kolar created a record of sorts on Wednesday, pronouncing her 100th verdict under provisions of Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (Pocso) Act in about two and a half years.

In the 100th conviction, second additional district and sessions judge BS Rekha , 50, awarded seven years’ rigorous imprisonment to Anand from Hanumanthapura village, Kolar taluk, for kidnapping and raping a minor girl on December 22. He was fined Rs 10,000.

Judge Rekha has been able to prevail upon advocates to stick to the schedule and carrying the cases to their logical conclusion, Muniswamy Gowda, special public prosecutor who appeared for the state in all 100 cases, told TOI.

Advocate V Sreedhararmuthy said the judge treats every case on merit and doesn’t allow hypothetical questions to be raised during the proceedings. “Her systematic style of working ensures there is no scope for delay,” he added.

Another advocate, C Kondappa, said the judge is very helpful in ensuring advocates make their presentations with precision.

Coming from a family of advocates based in Tumakuru, Judge Rekha decided to pursue a legal career and became a district judge after passing judicial services examinations. She said in most Pocso cases, the accused commit the crime under the influence of alcohol.

She had earlier made headlines when she sent five people to the gallows in two separate cases on one single day. She had awarded death penalty to Ranjith Kumar for attempting to rape and murdering a class 10 girl when she was returning home on August 1, 2019. The judge pronounced her verdict on September 15, 2019, with the framing of charges, remanding and court proceedings being completed in record 45 days, recalled Gowda. The same day, the judge had awarded death sentences to another four people accused of gang-raping a minor girl in Masthi police limits.

Representative image

CHENNAI: A resort owner accused of being a benami of V K Sasikala and aiding her benami transaction to the tune of Rs 148 crore in demonetised currency, has approached the Madras high court claiming it was a commercial transaction, that too cancelled as Sasikala’s option.

Naveen Baalaji, who was alleged to have sold a resort in Puducherry — Ocean Spray — to Sasikala, wanted the court to quash a provisional attachment order passed by the income tax department in connection with the cancelled transaction. Admitting his plea, Justice Anita Sumanth directed the tax department to file its reply by February 19.

According to Naveen, his family is into jewellery business in Puducherry. “In 2000, we ventured into foreign exchange and travel-related services and started Bonjour Bonheur Private Limited. In 2009, it ventured into hotel and hospitality business by promoting a resort — Ocean Spray,” the petitioner said. As the new ventures were failing, they decided to dispose the resort in 2016. As a prospective buyer, representatives of Sasikala approached him and offered Rs 168 crore for the property. Since demonetisation was announced, he was compelled by Sasikala to accept Rs 148 crore as advance in demonetised currency, he said.

When he was about to return unutilised Rs 37 crore of the advance to Sasikala, her representatives told him the transaction has been cancelled and demanded that he return the advance. It was at that point the tax department raided various places of Sasikala, including the petitioner and arrayed him as her benami. Even as he was contesting the actions of the department and sought permission to cross-examine Sasikala and others, the authorities on January 20 passed an order to provisionally attach the properties under Benami Act, he said.

Pramod Sawant

PANAJI: To establish Goa as a “model for international standards for electric vehicles (EVs)”, chief minister Pramod Sawant has proposed to bring 50 electric buses in the state this year. These will be added to Kadamba Transport Corporation’s (KTC) existing fleet and will be introduced along with associated infrastructure such as charging stations at all KTC bus stands.

“Electric vehicles are widely gaining markets across the globe. The automotive industry is rapidly shifting from traditional fuel-based technology to eco-friendly technologies,” Sawant said in his budget speech on Thursday.

KTC is placing an order for the buses under the second phase of the FAME India (Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of Hybrid and Electric Vehicles in India) scheme, initiated by the ministry of heavy industry (MoHI) to assist states in purchasing EVs.

KTC had requested for 250 electric buses in July under the scheme and received a green signal for 50 e-buses.

The corporation was scheduled to open the financial bid for these buses by November 5 while the order letter for the procurement of 50 EVs was to be issued by November 15. This deadline was, however, postponed.

The crumbling bus stands at Mapusa and Quepem will soon receive a makeover, while proposed bus stands at Bicholim and Sakhali will see speedy completion, Sawant said.

To help water vessels navigate with ease, he also resolved to take up reconstruction of the lighthouse at Campal. Heavy erosion and salinity have affected the structure.

A Hyderabad house designed by architect Suresh Kumar. He says beige marble makes the space look larger

BENGALURU: White marble that renders a Taj Mahal look to walls and its greyish variant that makes floors look elegant are passé in Bengaluru, with property owners increasingly embracing beige.

Stone industry experts confirm that beige is the new hue that Bengalureans want their buildings, especially swanky villas and high-end flats, to don. Beige embodies luxury and sophistication, said Manoj Kumar Singh, Federation of Indian Granite and Stone Industry vice-president, adding: “These shiny pieces of stone are mostly imported from Turkey and are in high demand in the southern part of the country, especially Bengaluru.”

Singh, who also runs a marble factory in the city, said they have been getting orders for beige marble not only from star hotels and malls but also villas and bungalows spread over 2,000 to 2,500 sqft. There are over 200 shades of beige marble. “Unlike Mumbai and Delhi where the trend is to combine beige with darker shades to create borders or a pattern, in Bengaluru, the demand is for plain beige,” Singh told TOI.

But why are Bengalureans going for beige? Architect Suresh Kumar of DSK Architects said: “When it comes to showcasing luxurious life, shades of beige dominate. Earlier, darker tones in marble and granite were in fashion. Lately, beige marble has gained popularity due to its high-gloss surface that signifies luxury. Beige marble creates a whole new ambience and along with warm lighting, it makes the space look larger and brighter.”

Though the realty market is currently slow, property buyers are not ready to sacrifice sophistication. “Beige has become synonymous with status enhancement,” said Kumar, who has been specialising in the luxury realty segment.

City-based interior designer Rafida Asmia, who claims to have designed 45 homes in two years, said around 25 opted for beige marble. “Earlier granite was in vogue, but now we don’t even suggest it unless the client insists. Increasing number of villas and independent houses are opting for beige marble as it’s aesthetically pleasing and affordable.” Some of her clients have insisted that even entrance walls be covered with Botticino marble (beige). “It doesn’t hit your eyes like extremely white or dark shades of marble do,” she added.

Suresh Hari, chairman, Confederation of Real Estate Developers Association of India (Credai), said: “Makrana marble (white) was in high demand years ago in the city. It’s not a common sight any more. The shift in trend is because people have realised that maintenance of white marble is a pain as compared to the beige variant.” However, procuring quality marble remains a challenge, he maintained.

“Biege marble is being imported from Turkey. It has become affordable too as the price has reduced from Rs 500 per sqft to Rs 250. A majority of middle-class home owners opt for cutter-sized slabs that are around 3ft, whereas the normal-sized ones are 6ft. Smaller-sized slabs means more joints, which doesn’t look as neat as bigger tiles. But even this slight adjustment is working for a lot of people,” Singh explained.

HYDERABAD: After drawing flak for delay in dispatching smart cards to applicants of vehicle registration and driving license, the Regional Transport Authority (RTA) is now facing heat for non-payment of salaries to home guards working at RTA offices.

Each home guard is paid Rs 20,000 a month, and there are 100 employees in Hyderabad and Rangareddy districts.

“With no salary from past three months, most of us are now in debts,” said Ravikanth (name changed on request), a home guard working at Khairtabad RTA. “Every home guard has to be paid Rs 60,000 pending salary by the department. I request the officials to give us our salaries without any further delay.”

A home guard from Secunderabad RTA said, “I took a loan of Rs 50,000 to pay my house rent and other bills. I was threatened by my house owner twice in these three months to vacate the house for paying rent late. The entire loan has gone to pay the house rent, bills and school fee of my two children. Now, we hardly have any money left to even buy groceries.”

“Home guards had faced a similar problem last year in May when they were not paid their salaries for four months,” said M Dayanand, general secretary, Telangana Auto, and Motor Welfare Union. When contacted, joint transport commissioner (IT), C Ramesh said, “We have released the budget, but they did not receive it yet because there is a problem in salary payment process. Our officials are looking into it and the problem will be solved in a day or two. If it is not solved, I will take it up personally and see that it is sorted.”

Addressing the public, he said the farming community had repeatedly been demanding for an electrical substation in the area to curb low voltage issue. “That’s why we have set up the 110/22 kilo watt power substation at Yemapalli. After the trail run for a few weeks, chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswami will dedicate the substation for public use,” Thangamani said. The minister also hoped that farmers in Yemapalli and Putlur would benefit from the move.

Until a few years ago, the Tamil Nadu Electricity Board (TNEB) used to set up only 60 substations in a year. “But our government has erected 480 substations in four years. Our aim is to make the state power surplus,” the minister said.

Thangamani said his department had set a target to set up 130 electrical substations in the state in the current financial year. “We have set up 119 substations so far.”

When asked about the compensation for farmers, who gave consent to erect electricity towers on their farmlands, the minister said steps were being taken to issue them compensation at the earliest. Collector C Megraj, Tiruchengode revenue divisional officer P Maniraj and TNEB officials participated in the event.

Sridhar Rao and Amruta (right) in police custody

BENGALURU: A 27-year-old man arrested along with his techie-girlfriend — accused of murdering her mother — in Port Blair, Andamans , has told police he was clueless about her deeds and was holidaying with her as planned.

The woman had also attempted to murder her brother at their Ramamurthynagar house on Sunday.

C Amruta, 33, meanwhile, is sticking to her version that she killed her 54-year-old mother and attempted to murder her brother as she had incurred a Rs 15 lakh debt and was worried about the taint it would leave her family with.

Her friend , Sridhar Rao, a Banaswadi resident, told police Amruta never told him about the murder she had committed before leaving with him for Port Blair on Sunday morning.

Amruta and Rao flew to Port Blair from Kempegowda International Airport around 6.30am. While she did not carry her mobile, he switched off his device soon after landing at 9.30am. “Rao says he did so since the connectivity was poor,” a police officer said.

“Rao’s claims are hard to believe. Why did he switch off his mobile soon after landing at Port Blair airport? He could have used the hotel WiFi but didn’t. They were trying to get a temporary sim card in Port Blair,” the officer added.

Rao and Amruta worked together in a private company in Whitefield between 2015 and 2017. A Bachelor of Business Management (BBM), Rao is currently pursuing MBA through correspondence, police said.

Rao also maintained that Amruta had told him they would stay in Andamans for a week. “We are in a relationship. In the third week of January, she told me we would fly to Port Blair and she would bear the expenditure,” police quoted Rao as having said.

On Sunday morning, Amruta allegedly hacked her mother C Nirmala to death using a digging bar around 4.30am. She later stabbed her brother C Harish in the neck. Harish collapsed and thinking he was dead, she left the house. CCTV evidence later revealed that Rao arrived on a scooter near Amruta’s residence and the two rode to KIA.

She would slip into depression

According to a close family member of Amruta, she had tried to kill herself when she was in college. “Amruta would slip into depression for many days. Since December, she had been working from home. She suffered from sleep disorders too. We may take her to a psychiatrist if needed,” a senior police officer said.

File Photo of CBI office

BENGALURU: The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) has given a clean chit to a small-time businessman who was called the kingpin of an alleged lottery scam and arrested in 2015.

In a chargesheet filed recently, the agency, which inquired into the case, has revealed that there was no lottery scam and 10 police officers conspired to falsely implicate the businessman, Parirajan. The officers, it alleges, planted bogus evidence during a raid at Parirajan’s residence in BEML Nagar in KGF.

The chargesheet was submitted to the XVII additional chief metropolitan magistrate court, and the CBI has sought sanction from the state government to prosecute the officers.

Parirajan, known as Rajan to friends, had a brief moment in the limelight in 2015 after he claimed in a sting conducted by a Kannada TV channel that he ran a lottery business and had connections with some IPS officers. On May 1, 2015, officers from the KGF excise enforcement and lottery prohibition wing raided his house.

The team later said it had seized computer-printed lottery tickets with different names, chequebooks and result sheets.

The CBI chargesheet now states that the raid was staged with “mala fide intention” and material seized from Parirajan’s house was planted there. As part of its evidence, the CBI has submitted the analysis of a hard disk seized from the police team behind the raid. The analysis, conducted at the Central Forensic Science Laboratory in Delhi, showed that the result sheets that the police team cited as evidence against Parirajan were actually printed at the police station a few hours before the raid. Sub-inspector Raviprakash took the printouts, according to the chargesheets.

After Parirajan was arrested, IPS officer Alok Kumar’s name was linked to the scam and he was suspended. The suspension was later lifted.

“I stand vindicated. My name was unnecessarily dragged into the case. The CBI has informed the state government that I had no role in the matter,” Kumar, who is now the additional director general of police, told TOI.

A bus plies thorough a dilapidated road in Bengaluru (File Photo)

BENGALURU: The high court on Thursday directed Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike ( BBMP ) to undertake a fresh survey of all roads in Bengaluru to identify potholes and take necessary steps to fill them. The civic agency has to complete the exercise by March 31 .

A division bench headed by chief justice Abhay Shreeniwas Oka also directed the Palike to appoint the civil engineering department of Indian Institute of Science (IISc) to conduct audit of pothole-filling work undertaken on 74 roads, which the civic body claims are crater-free.

BBMP has been directed to ensure all ongoing works, including TenderSURE project and those undertaken by other entities like Bangalore Water Supply and Sewerage Board, Bangalore Electricity Supply Company and Gas Authority of India Limited, are completed as per schedule.

Regarding availability of compensation in pothole-related accidents as well as grievance redressal mechanisms available to citizens of Bengaluru, the court directed BBMP to give wide publicity to the matter. Referring to BBMP’s claim that newspaper advertisements could be costly, the bench said the agency can choose other modes.

Notices to mayor, his deputy

In a related development, the court directed the registrar general to issue notices to mayor Goutham Kumar Jain, deputy mayor CR Ram Mohan Raju and five others.

The court has sought their response by March 16 regarding the assertion made by BBMP commissioner BH Anil Kumar in his affidavit filed on November 27 last year. The Palike chief had stated he’d held a meeting with these people in connection with July 31 and September 9 orders of the court saying BBMP is bound to compensate victims of pothole-induced accidents and has to publicise the same.

However, in another affidavit filed on February 4, he said he only held consultations with the mayor and others and there was no meeting. Use of the term ‘meeting’ in his November 27 affidavit was inadvertent and unintentional, he said.

Notices have also been issued to KA Muneendra Kumar, leader of ruling party in BBMP; Abul Wajid, leader of opposition; Lavanya Ganesh Reddy, chairperson of the standing committee for major public works; SP Hemalatha, chairperson of taxation and finance committee, and Mujahid Pasha, chairman of standing committee for public health.

The court is hearing a PIL filed by Vijayan Menon and others seeking a series of directions, including one to BBMP to place a report on action taken to repair killer potholes. The next hearing is fixed for April 1.

Losing Muscle

HYDERABAD: Whether Hyderabad has the best Biryani or not is something that may be open to debate, but a study has revealed a startling fact — Hyderabadis seem to be fussy about having their daily glass of milk and consuming other dairy products and end up consuming a protein-deficient diet .

As per a study conducted by Neilsen for Mumbai-based dairy FMCG player Parag Milk Foods Ltd (PMFL), 76% of Hyderabadis lacked protein in their daily diet and were even unaware of its adverse lifestyle effects such as poor concentration, muscle loss, constant hunger, Anaemia, low immunity, hair loss, skin peel, ridges in nails and Polycystic Ovarian Disease (PCOD), among others.

As per the findings of the study, 79% of Hyderabadis suffered constant tiredness, 73% often fell sick and 99% of them reported irregular eating habits due to a protein deficient diet . The number of people consuming a protein deficient diet was much lower in other cities like Mumbai, where it stood at 47%, followed by Kolkata (63%) and Delhi (64%).

The all-India figures suggest that 63% consume insufficient protein in their diet and 7% are borderline protein deficient, it added. Similarly, due to lack of adequate protein in diet, 59% of Indians suffered constant tiredness, 60% complained of poor concentration, 47% suffered from muscle loss, 63% were facing hair loss and 92% suffered constant tiredness, the study revealed.

Commenting on the findings of the study, Devendra Shah, chairman, Parag Milk Foods Ltd said: “Given the changing fast-paced lifestyle, Indian consumers are adapting to a healthier and balanced diet, yet 80% of vegetarians are protein deficient. This is a wake-up call for us to take action and ensure an adequate in-take of protein on a daily basis.”

HYDERABAD: Former special chief secretary of the state Mohammad Shafiquzzaman on Thursday approached the Telangana high court and filed a public interest litigation (PIL) questioning the police for its alleged insistence on applying for permission even for indoor congregations. The plea also questioned the police’s last-minute denials for public meetings.

“Even in cases where they accord permissions, they are doing so after changing the venue and imposing restrictions on the number of people to be assembled,” the former official said. He filed this plea along with another petitioner Syed Ghouse Mohiuddin Quadri. “The right to public meeting or procession flows from the right to assemble which is often exercised to express protest against the government or any social injustices,” they said in their plea, adding: “ Freedom of assembly promotes public discourse and diversity and acts as a tool to achieve changes in the society.”

They contended that neither the Indian Police Act nor the Hyderabad Police Act envisage that organisers apply for permission. Referring to reports, the petitioners complained that the police had thwarted attempts made by organisers for an indoor meeting with former Jawaharlal Nehru University student union president, Kanhaiya Kumar. The petitioners alleged that while the police denied permission for the meet, they had also threatened the owner of the venue.

“In fact, there is no mandatory requirement to seek police permission to hold such indoor meets...This is nothing but interfering with fundamental rights of the people guaranteed by the Constitution,” the petitioners said and sought a direction to the police to not insist on permissions for holding indoor meets.

In the petition addressed to the station inspector, district secretary of the organization Mani Amudhan stated that the forest minister should be booked under sections of the Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe Prevention of Atrocities Act for asking the boy, who belongs to a tribal community, to unbuckle his footwear.

“The minister knew that he was tribal boy and asked him to do the job for him with casteist mindset. Along with the minister, officials and police personnel, who were present at the spot should also be booked under the same sections, he said.

COIMBATORE: Several dead fish were found floating in a stream near the check dam at Nanjundapuram in the city on Thursday. Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board (TNPCB) officials have collected water samples from the spot for analysis to identify the cause of fish death.

The stream comes from Vellalore check dam and flows to Singanallur tank after reaching the check dam in Nanjundapram.

Residents in the area said they had in the past three days seen fish rising to the stream surface for breathing. V Shanthamani, a local resident, said, “Even three days ago, some fish had died. But on Thursday, the number increased. There must be around thousand dead fish. The stench is unbearable. We are unable to eat or carry out daily chores.”

Environmental activists said the problem started at Selvapuram. “There are bleaching units in Selvapuram. They bleach old clothes. Bleaching effluents from the units can be found at Puttuvikki Bridge across the stream. There are also effluents from other units. Domestic sewage also gets mixed in the stream. This might have caused their (fish) death,” said R Manikandan, a member of Kovai Kulangal Padhukappu Amaippu. “Another reason might be lack of oxygen.”

Pollution control officials have conducted preliminary inspection of the water. “The total dissolved solvents level in the water is around 1,000. This is not too high to cause their death. We guess it might have been caused due to oxygen depletion resulting from dense water hyacinth in the stream. We have collected water samples. Only after analysis we can say for sure,” said P Manimaran, district environmental engineer (south), TNPCB.

Environmentalist Manikandan said the level of total dissolved solvents at Chithirai Chavadai, the origin of Noyyal river , was 160 and that the same increased with the river’s course. “At Perur, it’s 250, at Vellalore it’s 1,000 and at Nanjundapuram it’s around 1,160,” he said.

Singanallur MLA N Karthik visited the stream on Thursday. He said he had taken up the issue with city corporation officials for immediate action. “I had submitted more than 50 petitions to the civic body to desilt and preserve waterways such as Sanganur Odai and Raja Vaikkal. But the civic body is yet to take any action. Fishes have died because of their negligence,” he said.

MADURAI: The Tamil Nadu 108 ambulance employees’ welfare association on Thursday passed a resolution to protest against transfer of employees to Kerala. In a press meet held in Madurai , the members of the association said the state government has been continuously ignoring their various demands, including transfer of employees to Kerala citing shortage of staff.

“On January 5, across Tamil Nadu, our association submitted petitions to district collectors and later directly to state authorities, with various demands, which included demand for new ambulances to be sanctioned to replace damaged old ones and sudden transfer of employees to Kerala, without informing the association,” said M Irulandi, the association’s state president. However, repeated pleas have since been ignored regarding transfer of the employees.

“When we spoke to media, 15 employees were again transferred. Later, when we threatened to not serve during jallikattu this year, the government temporarily suspended transfers. On January 23, talks were also held but there was no definitive action. We realized that the authorities were just letting us drag till our contract term expired at the end of last month,” explained Irulandi. The association is however still yet to decide on the date of protest and whether it will be across Tamil Nadu or just outside the state secretariat.

The association also passed various other resolutions at their meeting held on Thursday, including sanctioning of funds of Rs 53,700 each for the families of two ambulance drivers, who were killed in accidents last year.

MADURAI: Mass transit public places in Madurai like the railway station and MGR bus stand continue to remain vulnerable to the spread of infections despite efforts taken to keep the places clean.

However, health department officials have not issued specific instructions to the sanitary staff of the railway station and the bus stand to pay extra attention to cleanliness with respect to nCoV.

“We work several shifts on a rotational basis and keep the station clean and tidy, including platforms and toilets. We have also been provided with protective gear like masks and gloves,” said a sanitary worker.

However, with commuters openly spitting and littering and drinking water taps and basins used for washing as well, it becomes vulnerable for the spread of infectious germs. Toilets and wash basins also lack soaps or hand sanitisers.

Sources at the railway junction said so far no official instruction has been given to intensify cleanliness measures with regard to nCoV. “If an order is issued, we will comply. We have adequate water supply,” said a source.

Meanwhile, at the MGR Bus Stand at Mattuthavani, which witnesses thousands of commuters every day, hygiene is a concern as workers try to keep the surroundings clean round-the-clock. Many spots have garbage piling up despite the presence of dustbins or have water leaking and stagnating from wash basins or drinking water taps.

“We are continuously putting in efforts to maintain cleanliness in the bus stand. Ultimately, when it comes to the spread of infections like nCoV, it is more about an individual’s personal hygiene,” said a city corporation health official.

CHENNAI: The All India Council for Technical Education ( AICTE ) has fixed 1:15 faculty-student ratio for deemed universities, autonomous colleges and accredited engineering colleges . The approval handbook for 2020-21 was released on Wednesday.The latest move of the AICTE, which in 2018-19 diluted the 1:15 faculty-students ratio to 1:20, resulting in more than 22,000 faculty members losing their jobs in Tamil Nadu alone, is expected to increase the demand in TN. Many teachers from the state are now employed in states such as Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka, say sources. “Deemed universities and autonomous colleges are not the same as other institutions. They were given special status for providing quality education. So, they need to ensure 1:15 faculty-students ratio,” a senior AICTE official said.However, the decision to relax the faculty-student ratio for PG courses from 1:12 to 1:15 may not affect many, say faculty members, pointing out that PG admissions have come down and many faculty members have been given pink slips.The AICTE also said technical institutions should have 60% of their courses to be accredited in the next three years and asked the expert committee to ensure faculty availability by the annual salary paid statements in addition to their physical presence. Institutions should not demand original degree certificates from faculty members at the time of joining the institution, it said, adding that doing so would attract punishment including ban on admission for one year and withdrawal of approval. This follows the suicide of T Vasanthavanam on November 12, 2018, after he was denied the original certificate from a city college where he worked.K M Karthik, founder of All India Private Colleges Employees Union, said the new faculty-students ratio would bring down unemployment.A few autonomous colleges said it would be difficult to recruit 25% additional faculty before the March 5 deadline. “We may have to recruit more than 50 faculty members. It is difficult to recruit more members before first week of March.

KOLKATA: In a startling revelation, the Kolkata Municipal Corporation (KMC) assessment department has found that the civic body could make a fortune by bringing 40,000 flats, which have so far remained unassessed, under the ambit of its property tax assessment .Of these unassessed flats, 35,000 belong to the high-rise category and 30,000 are located in areas off EM Bypass. The rest lie scattered in Behala, Tollygunge and Jadavpur areas. “If properly monetized, the newly found ‘gold mine’ can yield Rs 200 crore-Rs 250 crore revenue every year,” said a senior KMC revenue department official.KMC assessment department sources said officials stumbled upon the ‘hidden treasure’ when they began a hunt for revenue launched a year ago. An official said the civic body’s revenue department inspectors and officials conducted surveys of unassessed properties , especially in added areas like Behala, Tollygunge, Jadavpur and EM Bypass.The official was surprised at how the growth of the high-rises off EM Bypass and in Behala had gone unnoticed. “A casual walk in five-six wards will tell you how these localities are changing. Similarly, some areas in Behala, Joka, Tollygunge and Jadavpur have registered a steady growth of high-rises,” he said.Sensing a huge potential of revenue, the KMC has chalked out a plan to fill up the civic coffers. “We have formed a team that will meet the owners of the unassessed flats. If needed, we shall send our inspectors with the requisite papers so that a flat owner does not have to face difficulties at our offices,” another official said.However, monetizing the unassessed properties won’t be easy as a section of flat owners are not willing to get their properties assessed. “Some flat owners are yet to respond to our appeal. We shall assess their properties and issue suo motu bills to them,” he said.",kolkata,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74001017,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-392406,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/unassessed-apartments-kmcs-hidden-treasure/articleshow/73994120.cms
268,['7/02/2020'],JICA consultants conduct survey at AIIMS site in Thoppur,"This story is from February 7, 2020

MADURAI: About 10 representatives from the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) visited the site for the proposed All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) in Thoppur on Thursday to conduct survey.

“Once the land for AIIMS was sanctioned, a preliminary project report was prepared by HLL, a government of India healthcare enterprise. Four teams from JICA will now be conducting surveys at the site for one month and submit a report,” T Sabeetha, deputy director of medical education, who accompanied the team from JICA, told TOI. She added that around 40% of the work for the compound wall has been completed.

“Once the JICA team completes the report, a plan will be prepared and discussions will be held in Tokyo in March. By April, they are expected to submit the plan to the Indian government. Later, as per administrative procedure, the government and JICA would reach an understanding,” she added.

The deputy director further said that it was still too early to say when the construction of the medical college and hospital would begin. The more than Rs 1,200 crore-worth AIIMS project in Madurai was first proposed in 2018.

Earlier this week, senior doctors at the Government Rajaji Hospital (GRH), JICA representatives and the deputy director held a consultation meeting regarding the Rs 330 crore JICA project at the hospital. “We held meetings with senior doctors of various departments for the proposed seven-storey JICA facility. We prioritised the necessary funding for the required equipment and prepared a preliminary report,” said Sabeetha.

The project boasts of introducing state-of-the-art advanced operation theatres, post-operative care and intensive care units. In December 2019, a JICA consultant had also visited GRH to discuss the skill development and technological needs of the doctors for the project. “The demolition and construction for the ongoing project at GRH is likely to start by June,” she said.

MADURAI: A fire broke out in the campus of a government primary school near Kovilpatti in Tuticorin district on Wednesday evening, destroying books and supplies. However, the school students remained unhurt.

The fire broke out at the library room in Kayathar government primary school in Asoor. Residents noticed smoke coming from the school and immediately informed the school authorities. Upon opening and inspecting the school, it was found that a fire was spreading inside the library room. With the help from residents, the fire was soon extinguished. Around 50 students study in Classes I to V at the primary school, taught by a teacher and a headmaster. The Kayathar police have registered a case. Since there was no electric wiring that could have caused a fire, the police suspect that miscreants might have caused the fire.

CHENNAI: Following Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman’s announcement in the budget that highly polluting thermal power plants would be phased out, the Central Pollution Control Board ( CPCB ) has tightened the noose around Unit 1 of North Chennai Thermal Plant II, with a capacity of 600MW. The central agency has written to Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board (TNPCB), asking why it has failed to prevent pollution from the particular unit.

The show-cause notice has given 15 days to the power plant to respond. The central board has pointed out that the unit is emitting sulphur at levels much higher than permissible limits. Units 1 and 2 at North Chennai, each with a capacity of 600MW, were commissioned in 2014. Notice, however, has been issued only to Unit 1. The CPCB has threatened to close the unit if action is not taken within a stipulated time.

“Unit 1 of North Chennai Thermal Power Station-II had submitted that feasibility study for installation of flue gas desulphurization for compliance of SO2 emission limit has been completed,” said CPCB chairman S P S Parihar.

But the station has failed to comply with the directions issued under Section 5 of the Environment (Protection) Act in December 2017 for compliance of emission limit of SO2 and impacting ambient air quality in and around the thermal power plant, the chairman said.

“In exercise of power vested under Section 5 of the Act, North Chennai station is hereby directed to show cause as to why Unit 1 of the plant should not be closed, and environmental compensation be imposed for the continuing non-compliance of the directions,” the chairman warned.

In the coming days, the power demand is likely to increase due to change in weather and if the Unit 1 is closed, there will be a loss of 600MW and the discom will have to look at purchasing power from private companies or the market.

“We are looking at the notice and will act as early as possible. The notice has been issued to TNPCB and once we get an official notice, we will respond,” said a senior Tangedco official.

MADURAI: Former AIADMK minister R S Raja Kannappan , known for switching his loyalties between the AIADMK and DMK is moving over to the DMK again when party president M K Stalin visits the city on February 23.

Kannappan, who participated in the anti-CAA signature campaign conducted by the DMK in the city in the presence of Madurai north district secretary P Moorthy, told reporters that he was going to join the party under the leadership of the next chief minister and Tamil Nadu’s promising star Stalin. “It would be a gala event with about two lakh people gathering there and me and my supporters would be joining the DMK,” he said.

Kannappan said that it was important that the next rule in the state was one of integrity and that would be for the people of Tamil Nadu. There may be many Dravidian parties but Stalin is the only person who is conducting the party in the real Dravidian path and fit to be a a leader of these parties.

“AIADMK is there but there is no leadership, and they are just giving up the rights of Tamil Nadu by trying to please the central government, be it the CAA or the hydrocarbon issues. They do not have the power to oppose these anti-peoples projects. This has become a rule of commissions and corruptions, and they just want to be in power as long as they can. Hence, I am moving over to the better party which is working for the people of Tamil Nadu,” he said.

Kannappan was a member of the AIADMK founded by MGR in 1972. He then floated his own party Makkal Tamil Desam in 2000. He dissolved the party and joined the DMK in 2006, quit it and joined the AIADMK in 2009.

274,['7/02/2020'],Draft industrial policy targets Rs 3.5 lakh cr investment by 2024,"This story is from February 7, 2020

Vijayawada: The draft Industrial Development & Export Promotion Policy 2020-25 of the Andhra Pradesh government has targeted an investment of Rs 3.5 lakh crore in the state by the year 2024, even as it has projected that a total of 6 lakh jobs will be created during this time.

The last industrial policy, 2015-20, is due to lapse later this year. The draft of the new policy hopes to increase the contribution of manufacturing to GSDP (gross state domestic product) from 9.95% (2013-14) to 11.8% in 2019 to 16.6% in 2024. It aims to increase the contribution of industries to GSDP from 20.7% (2013-14) to 26.0% in 2019 to 27% in 2024. It claims to have grounded new projects worth Rs 2,20,024 crore by January 2020.

Andhra Pradesh expects to achieve the ambitious targets by strengthening DICs, district-sector studies, skill development as per industry needs, market access for MSMEs, provision of office space for prospective investors and the empanelment of trained professionals. The draft policy also proposes to offer, under fiscal sops, stamp duty/land conversion, non-claimable SGST, investment subsidy, and incentives for new technology, apart from 25% more incentives for special category enterprises.

The draft policy says it aims to create a competitive ecosystem for new industries and start-ups. The ecosystem would include a unique ID for each business, 100% of stamp duty and transfer duty, 100% of non-claimable SGST on construction of factory buildings in five years through equal instalments, and the front-ending of power supply at Rs 1 per unit for five years for new units or the expansion of existing units of all scales.

For new enterprises in the MSME sector 1.25% of land conversion charges—up to Rs 10 lakh—2.25% land cost rebate at industrial parks of up to Rs 10 lakh, interest subsidy of 9% term loan for five years, 15% investment subsidy on FCI (excluding cost of land) of up to Rs 20 lakhs for MSMEs.

The policy said that AP would be targeting investments in the agritech, agro-based and food processing industries, pharmaceuticals and chemicals electronics, aerospace and defence, textiles and apparel and auto and auto components. According to the draft policy, AP would be focusing on the export of marine products, processed food, spices, horticulture and agriculture produce, engineering goods, mineral & mined products, pharmaceuticals, textiles and garments.

The policy aims to promote a cluster-based approach for industrial investment. The clusters would be developed at Santabommali in Srikakulam district (1,272 acres) Atchutapuram (Expansion) DTA– (1,231 acres), Atchutapuram (de-notified area) (514 acres), and Dubacherla in West Godavari (543 acres) in north coast AP.

Clusters in the Rayalaseema region would include Kopparthy in Kadapa district (5,404 acres), Yerraguntla in Kadapa district (637 acres), Kurnool mega industrial hub (6,525 acres), Timmasamudram in Anantapur district (1,023 acres), Kosalanagaram in Chittoor district (1,500 acres), and Thatiguntapalle in Chittoor district (860 acres). Clusters in southern AP would include Thotapalli in Krishna district (460 acres), DMIH in Prakasam district (2,352 acres) and NIMZ in Prakasam district (1,783 acres)

The clusters would be developed by the AP Industrial Corridor Development Authority (APICDA). While the developer would bring in funds as equity, the government would provide land as equity, encumbrance free land, apart from wide approach roads to the national highway network, water and power supply and land conversion by the government.

Coimbatore: The Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2019 (CAA) is not against the Indian Muslims and those who are opposing it, like DMK’s M K Stalin, are fighting for the citizenship of Muslims from neighbouring countries such as Pakistan, Bangladesh and Myanmar, BJP national general secretary Muralidhar Rao said here on Thursday.

BJP does not accept Stalin speaking out for the citizenship of Muslims from neighbouring countries, Rao, who was in the city to participate in the birth anniversary event of farmer leader Narayanasamy, told reporters. “We welcome actor Rajinikanth’s support for CAA. We will conduct campaigns in villages to popularise the government’s policies such as CAA, Kashmir and Ram temple.”

BJP is not discriminating between languages and sees both Tamil and Sanskrit equals, Rao said. “The relationship between BJP and AIADMK is good. Tamil Nadu BJP president will be announced after the Delhi election,” he said.

Economic slowdown had occurred several times before and now the Centre is taking steps to revive the economy, he said. tnn

VISAKHAPATNAM: MoS for personnel, public grievances and pensions and PMO, Jitendra Singh said that Bhabha Atomic Research Centre (BARC) has developed a radiation technology to treat municipal sewage .

Replying to a question raised by YSRC MP Vijayasai Reddy in the Rajya Sabha on Thursday, the minister said the radiation technology utilises high energy gamma radiation from Co-60 gamma sources to treat dry sewage sludge.

As a result all pathogenic microorganism in the sludge is brought to a level that they can’t multiply further and the treated sludge is safe for human handling, he said. Department of atomic energy has set up a technology demonstration plant ‘Sewage Sludge Hygienisation Plant’ of 100 tonne per day capacity at Shahwadi in Ahmedabad. He further added that hygienised and enriched sludge from the plant is a rich source of micronutrients and organic carbon and can be used as organic manure for horticulture and agricultural. After commissioning the plant at Ahmedabad, Indore Municipal Corporation has come forward to adopt the technology and civil works have begun. tnn

NEW DELHI: As many as 2,782 people from Delhi travelled to China on or after January 15 when the outbreak caused by the coronavirus was at its peak.The immigration department has sent a list of all such people, in addition to around 70 tourists visiting Delhi from countries affected by the deadly virus, to the Delhi health department to trace them. Central Delhi has a maximum of 2071 such people, followed by south-east (280), east (169), north-west (118), south (64) and south-west (21).As on Thursday, a government source told TOI, 144 people have been traced and efforts are on to find the rest in the next two days. “None of those traced has any symptom. But, as a precautionary measure, we have isolated them at their homes. Our team will be in touch with the families and flag any deterioration in health that may signal coronavirus infection ,” said the officer leading the drive.Virologists say the coronavirus is like SARS and MERS — two other viral infections that had caused outbreaks in the past. “A strict screening of people coming from affected areas is the only way to control its spread. If the infection spreads in India, it may not be easy to tackle as coronavirus is a respiratory infection,” said a senior virologist at AIIMS.India has so far reported only three cases, all in Kerala. As per the latest medical update, they are stable. The Centre on Thursday confirmed all 645 people, evacuated from China’s Wuhan and lodged at the quarantine facilities in and around Delhi, had tested negative. According to the Union health ministry, their samples will be re-tested on the 14th day of the quarantine period.Sanjeev Khirwar, health and family welfare secretary in Delhi government, said, “All available manpower starting from the district magistrates and district surveillance officers to ASHA workers and auxiliary nursing midwives have been trained and tasked to trace these people.” A 24x7 helpline at the district level, in addition to a centralised one, has also been started.One of the issues being faced by many states is the shortage of personal protective equipment such as N95 masks. Delhi has five lakh masks and 5,000 masks each have been provided to the 11 district medical officers for distribution among health workers, said Khirwar.According to the World Health Organization, people should frequently wash hands and avoid close contact with anyone having fever and cough.

DMK president M K Stalin

CHENNAI: Expressing shock over the 100% increase in school dropout rates in three years in Tamil Nadu, DMK president M K Stalin on Thursday demanded setting up of a committee consisting of senior educationists to study reasons for increase in dropouts.

“The committee should analyse the reasons for dropouts at secondary level, including whether job cuts of their parents, are forcing them out of schools,” Stalin said in a statement. TOI had on Thursday reported that school dropouts in Tamil Nadu have increased from 8% in 2015-16 to 16.2% in 2017-18 quoting a reply by Union HRD minister Ramesh Pokhriyal in Parliament.

“The state government was giving wrong information about dropouts all along in the assembly. The policy note of school education department has given wrong information about dropouts saying 3.75% in 2015-16, 3.75% in 2016-17, 3.61% in 2017-18 alone dropped out from schools,” he said.

He further said the dropouts up to Class VIII have been brought down due to the no-detention policy in RTE Act.

“But, even that was also put to risk by announcing board exams to Class V and VIII and the move was withdrawn due to strong opposition from DMK,” he added.

AMMK leader TTV Dhinakaran also expressed shock and urged the government to take remedial action.

COIMBATORE: The narcotics intelligence bureau (NIB) - CID on Thursday arrested two youths including a college student for smuggling methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) pills and lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) stamps from Goa to conduct a rave party in Coimbatore.

Deputy superintendent of NIB-CID R Vincent and team arrested J Deepak, 23 and B Srijith, 21, of Palakkad in Kerala from Nava India after receiving a tip-off. “Srijith is a BSc Electronics student in a private college at Nava India and Deepak is a Bsc Computer Science graduate. We seized 10 grams and 200 milligrams of MDMA pills and 20 LSD stamps. They were selling one milligram MDMA pills to youths for Rs 2,000,” a police officer said.

Preliminary inquiry revealed that the duo had attended the rave party held at a resort in Sethumadai near Pollachi last May. A team led by police superintendent Sujit Kumar had busted the party and detained 163 youths, mostly IT employees and college students, who hailed from Tamil Nadu, Kerala and Karnataka. Police had seized cocaine, hash, MDMA, ganja and alcohol. However, the duo managed to escape from the resort.

“The duo was planning to organize a rave party in Coimbatore and with the help of their friends, smuggled the drugs to Coimbatore from Goa via Bengaluru and Kerala. Two more youths are absconding,” said Vincent. “MDMA is a synthetic drug, which alters mood. It is commonly called ecstasy or Molly. Its use leads to liver, kidney and heart failure.”

Chennai: The Madras high court on Thursday dismissed a batch of petitions seeking age relaxation for other backward class ( OBC ) category candidates in direct recruitment to posts of district judge (entry level).

Rejecting the pleas, the first bench of Chief Justice AP Sahi and Justice Subramonium Prasad said, “We may clarify that the issue of reservation cannot be mixed up with the question of relaxation of age, in as much as reservation is provided in terms of Article 16 of the Constitution to enable the fulfillment of the constitutional goal of equitable representation of the oppressed classes.”

Whereas, relaxation of age is an act or exercise of authority that renders a rule or some form of control or prescription, less strict or severe. It is an act that brings about some sort of partial remission by lessening the stiffness or intensity by bending it to a certain extent, the bench added.

Noting that the former (reservation), is in terms of the Constitution, the bench said, “The latter (relaxation) is a prescription of statutory procedure to meet a certain exigency at the option of the authority to exercise such power. The power to relax is not a fundamental right of reservation to be enforced under the Constitution. It is in cases of hostile discrimination or manifest arbitrariness that a challenge be raised upon exercise of such power.

283,['7/02/2020'],Teachers call for lenient promotion system,"This story is from February 7, 2020

Representative image

COIMBATORE: Teachers in higher education institutions have reiterated their demand for a lenient academic performance indicator (API) system for giving promotions through career advancement scheme.

API system was made mandatory for promotions and other benefits for faculty members of higher education institutions in 2010. It has a universal set of criteria for awarding scores that do not distinguish between teaching and research institutions or between rural and urban institutions, the teachers said.

“As per API requirements, we should publish research papers and conduct seminars. It is more suited for those, who are into full-time research and not into teaching. If teaching faculty focusses on research and publications, they would not have enough time for classwork,” a teacher said.

Teachers said there has to be distinction between purely teaching institutions, purely research institutions and those, which have a mix of both, and the API criteria should be framed based on that.

President of the Association of University Teachers (AUT) N Pasupathy said they have been representing the issue for long. “The API system doesn’t distinguish between rural institutions and urban institutions. It is difficult for faculty members in rural colleges to conduct national seminars. How would they meet the API criteria? It is unfair to have the same yardstick for rural and urban institutions,” he said. “Faculty members of teaching institutions would be unable to focus entirely on research and publication as they have pedagogical activities as well.”

While they were ready to conduct research and publish papers, it should not be forced on them for the sake of promotions and college rankings or it would lead to proliferation of bogus publications and paid journals, the teachers said. “We don’t oppose the system. We want it to be more sensitive towards the practicalities,” said Pasupathy.

While teachers have to rise to the occasion and do research and publications, making them mandatory, linking them with promotions, NAAC accreditation and NIRF rankings would bring down the quality of research and give rise to predatory publishing, said former general secretary of AUT C Pichandy.

The association had recently urged the University Grants Commission and the ministry of human resource development to withdraw the system.

<p>The facility has 47 beds out of which 45 are occupied<br></p>

MADURAI: Providing palliative care is challenging due to lack of infrastructure and manpower, said Madurai district collector T G Vinay on Thursday.

Palliative care and geriatric medicine are the need of the hour since life expectancy of people has increased due to advancement in medical care, but absence of the facility puts medical community in a difficulty position, he added.

Vinay took part in the 5th anniversary celebrations of Aishwaryam Trust, which runs Nethravathi palliative care centre for elderly people from poor background and abandoned on roadside at Vilachery.

The collector appreciated the team of doctors with social consciousness for starting the trust. At a time when people have become self-centric, to think beyond oneself and contribute to the society has to be appreciated, he said.

Vinay said he is ready to help them with infrastructure, manpower and financial support on behalf of the district administration. There are more such people needed to the society to make the place better, he added.

A group of seven doctors came forward to start the facility after realizing the pain borne by terminally-ill people from poor background in the absence of any facility for them. They first started a facility in a rented building, later shifted to a permanent building.

At present, the facility has 47 beds out of which 45 are occupied. Dr R Balagurusamy, chairman and managing trustee said that it costs around Rs 400 for one person per day and they find it challenging to run the hospice.

Representative image

VIJAYAWADA: The high court reserved the judgment on a petition seeking the cancellation of government order 176 confirming the reservations for local body elections. The high court bench headed by Chief Justice JK Maheswari heard the petition on Thursday and reserved the judgment.

The petitioners argued that the state government ignored the directions of the Supreme court and issued the GO exceeding the 50% reservations in local body elections. They argued that no socio-economic survey was conducted to gauge the BC population in the state. They questioned the government to explain the reasons for fixing 34% reservation for BCs in local body elections.

Arguing on behalf of the government, advocate general Sri Ram said the door-to-door electoral survey conducted by the government clarified that the population of BCs in Andhra Pradesh is around 48%. He said the government is giving lesser reservations when compared to the population of BC’s in the state. He reminded that the SC in some extreme cases exempted the state government from exceeding reservations more than 50%.

Sriram pointed out that the state government will lose around Rs 3,000 crore central funds, if the local body elections are delayed. He requested the court to give permissions to conduct the elections immediately.

The court after examining the arguments reserved the judgment.

Picture used for representational purpose

SRIKAKULAM: While Srikakulam district produces between 65,000 to 70,000 kg of total sugar production in the country, sugarcane farmers have to rely on one mill at Sankili in Rajam mandal in the district. Farmers have demanded that the government revive the closed sugarcane mill at Amadalavalasa.

Speaking to TOI, minister of roads and buildings Dharmana Krishnadas said though the government is focusing on fulfilling its poll promises, it will revive the sugarcane mill at Amadalavalasa.

Sugarcane farmers in the district have to depend on the mill at Sankili, said a spokesperson at the mill. Nearly 98 per cent of the sugarcane harvested is brought to this unit for crushing and extraction of sugar, while two per cent makes its way to local jaggery manufacturing units.

“We spend nearly Rs 3,600 to produce one quintal of sugar but sell at Rs 3,200 per quintal. The industry is running at a loss,” the spokesperson said, attributing fall in prices to the low priority given to sugarcane cultivation and the industry.

“The sugar industry is owned by the Centre, which collects taxes of Rs 475 under various heads, but does not pay attention to cultivaton, production or minimum support price (MSP) to farmers,” said K Sanyasinaidu , a sugarcane farmer from Rajam.

P Simhachalam, a sugarcane farmer from Sankili said, “Srikakulam district has abundant land to cultivate sugarcane, but farmers now are not happy with the way the government is handling the industry. Most farmers are instead turning to the cultivation of maize given its low investment and high returns.”

Close to 10,000 sugarcane farmers cultivate the crop on around 15,000 acres in the district. The average sugar production per annum in India ranges between 35 million tonnes to 40 million tonnes.

COIMBATORE: The rural police on Wednesday arrested three men, including a DMK functionary, for cheating a goat trader of Rs 5 lakh by offering to sell a temple kalasam (dome).

Police identified them as DMK functionary S Arumugam, 38 and K Raja, 43, of Kumarasamy Nagar in Tirupur and P Dhanabal, 33, of Somanur. “Dhanabal had told his friend P Saminathan, 50, of Moolanur in Tirupur, a goat trader, that he was in possession of a temple kalasam made of iridium, which had magical properties that would make him prosperous and popular.

CHENNAI: Chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswami on Thursday urged the Centre to lift the restriction on import of peas through Tuticorin port for the welfare of the dal and flour milling trade in the state as well as neighbouring southern states.

In a letter to Union commerce and industry minister Piyush Goyal, the chief minister recalled a public notification issued by the director general of foreign trade imposing a restriction on the import of peas to 1.5 lakh metric tonne for the entire country. “Due to this restriction, the cost of peas has drastically increased to more than Rs 65 per kg in Tamil Nadu. This ban has detrimentally affected the dal and flour mills operating as MSME units in Tamil Nadu and thereby the livelihood of labourers and others who depend on this trade,” Palaniswami said.

Due to heavy demand for peas to prepare traditional snacks in Tamil Nadu, Puducherry and Kerala, more than 1,000 micro , small, and medium dal and flour mills function in Tamil Nadu for processing the peas. They provide direct employment opportunity to around 50,000 labourers and indirect employment to 65,000 people. “The average requirement of peas in Tamil Nadu would be around two lakh metric tonnes, of which maximum of 10,000MT alone are being transported from the northern states,” the chief minister said.

Due to heavy demand of peas in other states, cost of peas transported from the northern states becomes very high and ranges up to Rs 60/kg. Hence, peas are imported from countries such as Australia, Canada and Russia through Tuticorin port at cheaper rates.

Peas are cultivated in an area of 5.40 lakh hectares in the country. The annual estimated production is 54.22 lakh metric tonnes. In Tamil Nadu, green peas are cultivated in 120 hectares and the production is 1,960MT.

MADURAI: Unscheduled power cuts have started affecting the residents in many parts of the city. Power has been going off in the mornings and afternoons for two to three hours on a daily basis, lament residents.

Melamadai, Anna Nagar and Gomathypuram areas had a power cut from 3pm to 6pm on Monday and the local electricity offices had calls from residents eager to know why the power had gone off. “Power shutdowns in the afternoons are causing inconvenience to the elders and children,” said K Chandran of Anna Nagar.

School students struggle a lot due to power cuts in the morning as the many school buildings are located in congested spots. “Many of these schools don’t have playground facilities and the children are forced to spend the whole day within the building in Anna Nagar, Gomathypuram and Melamadai and when the power goes off, the children really suffer and the education department should take note of this,” said Gomathy S of K K Nagar.

Othakadai, Villapuram, Anupandi, DRO Colony and Viswanathapuram are among the places that have been experiencing these frequent power cuts for the past few days. This condition prevails even after a full day shutdown is scheduled within the next few days.

Inverter dealers said that they have already started receiving prospective calls something that usually happens from March onwards and added that the demand is going up due to the rising afternoon temperatures and frequent power cuts.

TNEB sources said that they were not planning such shutdowns due to any shortfall, but it may be required due to some issues being detected in the respective sub stations. “Common problems like glows in the transformers are detected in summer and there were a few such cases recently and they needed attention,” sources said.

CHENNAI: Days after rolling back the plan for public examinations for Classes V and VIII, the government on Thursday made school education secretary Pradeep Yadav secretary of handlooms, textiles and khadi department. Dheeraj Kumar will now helm the school education department, besides youth welfare and sports development.

Recently, after an official session of the cabinet, several ministers opposed public examinations for young students, fearing backlash in the impending civic elections. Incidentally, the department issued the contentious order in September, without a cabinet nod, relying on the amendments to Right to Education Act. “Yadav himself opted to move out,” said a source.

The department introduced large-scale reforms, including restructuring cluster-based models in government schools and merging posts of district educational officers , inspector of matriculation schools and district elementary education officer posts, drawing the ire of the teaching fraternity. In January, students of Classes IX to XII were told to come to schools on January 16, during the Pongal holidays, to listen to Narendra Modi’s ‘Pariksha Pe Charcha’. Later, after the opposition hit out, the government said it was only an advisory and not a ‘circular’.

On Thursday, transport secretary B Chandra Mohan was named secretary, department of BCs, MBCs and minorities welfare. The post was additionally held by highways secretary A Karthik, who will now also helm energy department. Overseas Manpower Corporation Limited chairman and MD Dharmendra Pratap Yadav is the new transport secretary, while handlooms, textiles and khadi secretary Kumar Jayant will head the Overseas Manpower Corporation Limited as its chairman and MD, the order said.

MADURAI: Three workers, who were sleeping at a construction site, were killed when a concrete mixer truck ran over them. The accident took place early on Thursday morning, when the truck driver moved the vehicle in reverse direction without noticing the sleeping workers.

The deceased were identified as S Venkatesh, 30, S Periyasamy, 34, both from Attur in Salem district and A Babu, 38, from Koyambedu in Chennai. While Venkatesh and Periyasamy were killed on the spot, Babu was rushed to the Government Rajaji Hospital, where he died without responding to treatment.

The accident took place on the Vaigai river bank near Obula Padithurai, where the Vaigai River Front Development work, a project under Smart City Mission, executed by the Madurai Corporation, is taking shape.

Police sources said the workers slept in the open place on Wednesday night.

A corporation official said that they were engaged by the contractor, to whom the smart city work was allotted. The truck involved in the accident belongs to a sub-contractor.

“The deaths were purely due to negligence of the workers and the truck driver. Madurai Corporation has allotted place for them to stay, where temporary sheds have been erected. Many of the workers stay with their family members in the sheds. Had they slept in the allotted space, the incident would not have happened,” the official said.

The driver, identified as Arockiyasamy has been picked for inquiry. The Madhiciyam police registered a case.

The current car parking capacity at the airport is 270

COIMBATORE: Authorities are planning to construct a multi-level car parking lot near the cargo shed of the airport .

“The place chosen for the parking lot has staff quarters. We plan to remove the quarters and clear the space soon,” airport director R Mahalingam told TOI. “We have appointed a design consultant to do a detailed assessment of the location, feasibility and probable structural designs.”

The current car parking capacity at the airport is 270, the official said. “We plan to multiply it. The parking lot will be developed on a build–operate–transfer basis. The number of vehicles will be decided by the consultant, who will study the projected growth in traffic,” said the director.

With the air passenger traffic increasing between 15% to 20% every year, reaching up to 30 lakh in the last financial year, officials believe that increasing parking facilities is crucial. “We want to increase the size of the terminal buildings and runways as we are getting more business, passengers and traffic. Parking for passengers is a crucial infrastructure in any top airport. It must be expanded. The airport plans to create adequate infrastructure for passengers to park their cars when they board an aircraft and pick them up after they land, which is common abroad. So, there should be a facility to park cars even for a month,” said an official.

Corporation demolished five temples at Jeeva Nagar near Kavundampalayam on Thursday

COIMBATORE: The city corporation demolished five temples on the Link Road at Jeeva Nagar near Kavundampalayam on Thursday based on the directions of the Madras high court.

“After a long battle, the corporation had demolished the houses that were encroaching on the road a few months ago. But it did not clear the temples and some other private encroachments on the road. The building had to be removed to lay road. So, we sought the intervention of the court,” said Sumathi, president of the KK Pudur Women’s Association, who had filed a public interest litigation (PIL) a couple of months ago.

When the case came up for hearing on January 28, the court directed the civic body to remove the encroachments and lay the road before February 18. A corporation official said that officials of the town planning wing surveyed the land to identify the extent of encroachments and removed five temples. “We have prepared estimate to lay the road and fund has also been allotted,” he said.

The KK Pudur Welfare Association had filed a writ petition in HC a decade ago stating that the 70-feet Link Road was encroached. As a result, emergency service vehicles including ambulances and water tenders could enter the street. The court had passed directions in favour of the association in 2017.

The 21-year-old student from Jayanagar 4th Block had posted on an online advertisement portal that he wanted to sell his bike.

COIMBATORE: West zone inspector general of police K Periaiah has instructed the superintendents of police (SPs) in his jurisdiction to select police stations in their respective districts to develop necessary infrastructures that are required to bag ISO certification.

Periaiah said the SPs in Coimbatore, Nilgiris, Tirupur, Erode, Salem, Namakkal, Dharmapuri and Krishnagiri districts have been advised to focus on developing at least four police stations in their respective districts. “Most of the police stations in the west zone are having good ambiance. We have to now develop the infrastructure. Cops have also been advised to maintain friendly relations with the general public.” said Periaiah.

The move is inspired by Thondamuthur police station in the district bagging the ISO certification. The M-2 Thondamuthur police station has been certified ISO 9001:2015 for maintaining law and order, prevention and detection of crimes, creating awareness among public and maintaining friendly relation with the public with available resources for making strong social policing.

According to circle inspector G Manivannan said there is a herbal garden in front of the station. “As per the government order, the station should have 32 police personnel. But it has only 12 cops. Thondamuthur is the first police station to obtain the ISO certification in the western Tamil Nadu.

District SP Sujit Kumar, meanwhile, said other police inspectors have also expressed their interest to upgrade the infrastructure at their police stations to get the ISO certification.

BHOPAL: Nine years after Shivraj Singh Chouhan-led BJP government formed a special agriculture cabinet to resolve farmers’ issues, a little over a year after coming to power, the Congress government in Madhya Pradesh has come up with the idea of an agriculture advisory council (ADC).

It will be headed by the chief minister and the agriculture minister has been named as its vice-chairman. With a five-year term, the council will implement the recommendations of the farmers’ organisations and their representatives.

Interestingly, one of the members of the committee is also farmer leader Shivkumar Sharma alias Kakkaji, the president of Kisan Mazdoor Sangh, who is known for spearheading big farmers’ agitations across the state. Welcoming the move, he said that farmers would benefit if the government implements his recommendations in the right earnest.

Besides monitoring the ongoing loan waiver scheme of the Congress government, the ADC will also get feedback for the prices of agriculture produce and “work in the direction of making agriculture a profitable venture.”

Government sources said CM Kamal Nath wanted an organisation to closely monitor farmers’ issues along with the monitoring of various schemes, including the loan waiving scheme.

Besides the agriculture department secretary as member secretary of the council, there will be 20 members, including top government bureaucrats and the vice- chancellor of Rajmata Vijayaraje Scindia Krishi Vishwa Vidyalaya, Gwalior . There will be 7 non-government members, including Dinesh Gurjar from Morena, Shivkumar Sharma from Hoshangabad,Umrao Singh Gurjar from Neemuch, Kedar Sirohi from Harda, Vishwanath Okte from Chhindwara and Tarachand Patidar and Brijbihari Patel from Jabalpur .

The council will give suggestions and recommendations to the state government on the basis of feedback from the farmers. Its responsibilities also include reviewing the implementation of Centre-aided and state-aided schemes, besides extending their benefits to farmers and making recommendations after receiving suggestions. The council will take feedback and give suggestions in connection to crop prices, availability of seeds and facilities in mandis.

Guntur medical college

Guntur: The Medical Council of India (MCI) has granted permission to increase the number of super specialisation seats in neurology at Guntur medical college to four, making it the only college in the state to have four DM (doctorate of medicine) seats. Nizam’s Institute of Medical Sciences (NIMS) in Hyderabad has eight seats in DM stream, the highest in the two Telugu states.

The MCI board of governors, at its meeting held in New Delhi recently, gave the nod to increase the intake in DM neurology from the earlier two to four, after studying the report submitted by a expert panel which stated that the existing infrastructure in the department of neurology at GMC is on a par with other central deemed medical universities across the country.

The neurology wing at the medical college has undergone a complete revamp in the last few years under the leadership of department head Dr N V Sundarachary. Many philanthropists have come forward to help develop it further after seeing the services offered by the team of neurologists headed by Dr Sundarachary. Natco pharma sponsored the development of sleep lab at the hospital, the first such facility in government institutions in south India.

The neurology department is one of the few wings at the government general hospital (GGH) to receive the highest number of patients from across the two Telugu states, thanks to the services it offers to the poor. “More seats mean the state is going to get more super specialists to serve the people. We are happy to make the department a centre of excellence,” said Dr Sundarachary.

CHENNAI: Central Crime Branch ( CCB ) sleuths on Thursday carried out a search at the Mandaveli residence of DMK district secretary Senthil Balaji . The search by a five-member team led by assistant commissioner Ramachandramoorthy was underway till late in the evening.

Though the house was sealed on January 31 as it was found locked, the seal was removed for the search which began at 10 am. While the Madras high court refused to intervene on the search notice issued by CCB, Senthil Balaji’s advocates accompanied the police team as earlier police had said in the notice that either Balaji or his authorised representative can be present during the search procedure. They stayed throughout the raid. CCB began reinvestigating the case of alleged job fraud by Senthil Balaji on January 31 and carried out searches in 17 places in the city, Karur and Madurai.

The issue pertains to a complaint against Balaji, now a DMK MLA, with CCB alleging that when he was the transport minister in the AIADMK government, he along with his associates had duped job-seekers to the tune of Rs 2.31 crore after promising jobs in the state transport corporation. Apprehending arrest in the case, Balaji moved an anticipatory bail application. Admitting it and as an interim relief, Madras HC judge Justice Audikesavalu orally instructed the CCB not to harass him.

DEHRADUN: Chief minister Trivendra Singh Rawat on Thursday met the chairman of 15th finance commission, N K Singh in New Delhi and thanked him for the recommendations made by the body by “keeping in mind the tough conditions of the Himalayan state and its vulnerability to natural disasters”.

“The finance commission has considered this aspect of the state and increased the share of disaster relief fund to Rs 1,041 crore. It will certainly improve the state’s disaster management,” he added.The CM further said the state would immensely benefit from the revenue deficit grant and it will help in the financial management of Uttarakhand , as several crores of rupees are lost each year due to natural disasters.

The CM said Uttarakhand provides valuable environmental services, but the state has to face forest-related obstacles in the developmental works.

“There was a demand for a long time that states like Uttarakhand, which contributes to environmental protection, should be encouraged. The finance commission has increased the share of forests in the devolution formula from 7.5 % to 10 %, thereby increasing the share of revenue in the state,” Rawat said.

There has also been an increase of Rs 148 crore in the grants of urban local bodies and panchayati raj institutions of Uttarakhand, the CM said.

AMARAVATI: Mangalagiri legislator Alla Ramakrishna Reddy has appealed to agitating farmers of Amaravati to meet chief minister YS Jaganmohan Reddy to resolve their grievances . Cautioning them against falling prey to TDP chief N Chandrababu Naidu’s designs, Alla told the farmers that the Union government has already made it clear that it would not interfere in the capital city issue, and urged them to resolve their problems by discussing with the state government.

Speaking to reporters on Thursday, Alla said Naidu, who served as chief minister of the state for 14 long years, is now behaving like a village-level leader. “Amaravati farmers have never supported Naidu, who grabbed their lands in the capital city region people in the name of land pooling scheme (LPS). Now, he is using them for his selfish means. What has Naidu done for farmers after taking away their lands? I am ready to quit if Naidu or his son (Nara) Lokesh show any developed plot allotted to LPS farmers in Amaravati,” Alla alleged.

He also wondered why a capital city requires 1.6 lakh acres of land. “Naidu is solely responsible for shattering the dreams of farmers in the capital city region. Even after taking away farmers’ lands, he neither enhanced the tenancy amount nor hiked the pension for agriculture labourers,” Alla said. He added that the chief minister would not render injustice to any farmer in the capital city area and they should realise this fact.

Haridwar: Following the announcement of the trust that would oversee the construction and management of Ram temple in Ayodhya, divergent views have emerged from among the seers in Haridwar, where a few of them have raised objections over the nominated members of the trust.

While welcoming the formation of ‘Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Teerth Kshetra’ trust, Akhil Bharatiya Akhada Parishad president Narendra Giri objected to the nomination of Yogpurush Swami Paramanand from Haridwar, claiming that he was ""not associated with the temple movement.""

He also criticised the government for ignoring Nritya Gopal Das, president of the Ram Janmabhoomi Mandir Nyas.

“We are not happy with the nomination of Swami Paramanad as the member of the trust. Nevertheless, we won’t oppose it, as the construction of Ram temple is our foremost goal,” Giri told TOI.

Other seers such as Bhuma Niketan peethadhishwar Achyutanand Teerth and Shankaracharya Swami Swarupanand’s disciple, Avimukteshwaranand, were also not happy with the nomination of Vasudevanand Saraswati, the Shankaracharya from Jyotish Peeth.

Speaking to TOI, Avimukteshwaranand said, “The government, through the announcement of names for the trust, has sidelined the highest of the Hindu dharmacharyas.”

Meanwhile, other seers welcomed the announcement and expressed hope that the construction of Ram temple begins soon.

“This paves the way for construction of the Ram temple for which crores of Hindus have been waiting for decades,” seer Harichetananand said.

Another seer Paramanand opined, “Competent members from across the country have been chosen for the trust. As for Nritya Gopal Das, he has been the backbone of the temple movement and it makes no difference whether he is in the trust or not.”

Buggana Rajendranath

AMARAVATI: Notwithstanding YSRC’s resistance, legislative council chairman MA Shariff has appointed ministers Buggana Rajendranath and Botcha Satyanarayana as chairpersons of the select committees on the three capital cities and CRDA repeal bills.

The chairman also named a YSRC MLC in each select committee without getting recommendation from the party’s chief whip. After finalising the two panels, the chairman asked the legislature secretary to issue the notification and direct the select committees to begin the work.

MA Shariff had referred the controversial decentralisation of administration Bill and CRDA Repeal Bill to the select committees amidst uproar and a day-long logjam in the House on January, 22. The ruling YSRC government had protested the decision on the floor by raising slogans against the chairman. Subsequently, the AP assembly passed a resolution to abolish the legislative council in the state. The state government has already sent the resolution to the Union home ministry seeking introduction of a Bill to abolish the council in the Parliament. However, the council will continue to work till the Parliament clears the Bill and gets the President’s nod.

Meanwhile, YSRC pulled out all the stops to stall the constitution of the select committees by writing to the legislature secretary to not blindly follow the instructions of the chairman as he had violated the rules to use the discretionary powers. YSRC also refused to join the panels and turned down the chairman’s call to recommend members to the select committees.

After waiting for a week for YSRC’s response, chairman Shariff suo moto completed the process of appointing the select committees. Sources said finance minister Buggana Rajendranath has been made chairman of the committee to scrutinise the three capital cities Bill while municipal administration minister Botcha Satyanarayana will head the CRDA repeal Bill. It is not immediately clear whether the ministers will take up the job in wake of the party’s resistance to join the panels. The chairman is likely to change the chairpersons if the ministers refuse to head the committees.

Bhopal: Only 2% of people registered under Ayushman Bharat ‘Niramayam’ MP (ABN-MP) directly benefited, by way of hospitalisation under the scheme, since its launch in September 2018, according to Union ministry of health and family welfare (MoHFW).

About 80% of state’s population is covered under the scheme. In effect, 0.005% of 5.28 crore people (or 14 crore families) eligible for the health scheme have benefitted. In MP, 73% of people who are eligible are yet to be covered under the national health protection scheme.

The MP government with grant in aid from the Centre, has spent Rs 231 crore since the scheme was launched benefitting 2.69 lakh patients, who got treatment under the scheme that provides cashless medical facility up to Rs 5 lakh at a private or government hospital of choice.

The average rate expenditure under the scheme was Rs 8,500 per patient in MP. Experts point out that about 40% of the treatment cost is not added to the bill, if the patient was hospitalised at a government-run facility. Meanwhile, Chhattisgarh spent Rs 424 crores on 7.69 lakh patients in the same period.

Health experts point out that about 10% of the population need hospitalisation each year. At present, only 1.96% of an estimated 5.28 crore people who are eligible for the scheme are benefitting. The situation has got more complicated for many, as provision of treatment under state illness fund has been merged with ABN-MP. As of January 2020, only 1.40 crore people have been issued ABN-MP insurance cards.

To improve the situation, criteria for empanelment of private hospitals under ABN-MP, has been made less stringent to increase the reach of the government healthcare insurance scheme, according to ABN-MP officials.

The decision was taken at an ABM-MP board meeting held recently. It recommended lowering of criteria, earlier limited to hospitals only with National Accreditation Board for Hospitals and Healthcare Providers known as NABH accreditation.

ABN-MP with 1.40 crore registrations, is the highest in the country. However, the number of private hospitals empanelled under the scheme in MP is only 94. There are 338 government hospitals and health centres. When contacted, ABN-MP senior officials did not respond.

Vijay Chopra

Lucknow: Imagine galawati kebabs tickling the taste buds of French, and Awadh natives savouring the cassoulet. This delectable thought might become a reality as the natives of both France and Uttar Pradesh are great connoisseurs of food and appreciate platters that tickle their palate.

This idea has been mooted by the French ambassador to India, Emmanuel Lenain, who believes that UP and France can forge strong ties through the food route.

Speaking exclusively to TOI on the inaugural day of the Defence Expo, Lenain said, “Food industry is a great asset of French economy, and UP and France together can build new bridges in this sector.”

The ambassador sees immense scope for a fruitful association between his country and Uttar Pradesh given the growing urbanization of the country’s most populous state. He outlined water, sanitation, smart streets and transportation as key areas where the two governments can explore the opportunities of tie-ups.

Terming UP as a land with a rich culture and history, Lenain said French are aware of Awadh’s glorious past and have great respect for it.

In this light, the envoy stressed, more UP students could learn the French language and visit France to pursue higher education. “Also, more Indian tourists could visit our nation because human exchanges strengthen the bonding between countries,” the ambassador said, adding that they are keen to open more centres to teach French language in Uttar Pradesh.

The envoy said that after witnessing the magnitude of UP, French firms will surely consider investing in various sectors in the state and added that more than 60 companies from his country already have a strong presence in India.

Earlier in the day, speaking at a session on Indo-French relations, Lenain said the ties between the two nations have become stronger with every edition of the Defence Expo and pledged full support of his country to make in India projects. He termed this year’s Defence Expo as an incredible venue and a wonderful platform to explore global avenues. The ambassador said that the Indo-french asscoiation was the strongest in Asia-Pafific region.

French artist Enora Lalet

Bhopal: French artist Enora Lalet, who creates art with food, is here in Bhopal to break stereotypes related to cultures and cuisines by experimenting with food-art, making accessories and ensembles made entirely out of fruits, vegetables and local dishes.

Lalet started her journey 10 years ago when she decided to challenge the stereotypes and cultural conditioning of citizens of different countries by creating objects that were out of their comfort zone and they did not have an opinion or judgment about it.

“Every culture — Indian, French or Indonesian etc — has its own stereotypes, taboos, judgements, stigmas and dogmas. Food is something that is very culture specific and the idea of mixing the two to create a third object appealed to me. When you see a portrait or a landscape, you know how you are supposed to react because of the conditioning of the mind by the cultures, but because of this, people forget who they really are. This is an effort to allow them to think outside their norms and accept, appreciate, criticize something they haven’t seen before and introspect. They can also challenge their beliefs and thought process this way,” said Lalet.

As Lalet is in Bhopal, she is looking forward to experiment with local fruits like bananas, grapes, oranges and seasonal vegetables along with Ayurveda and some mythology and Gond art.

“As India has rich medicinal herbs and I have been using Ayurveda since the past few years, I hope to use that. Gond art of Madhya Pradesh is very popular, so I will also be making use of the art form for the art work here. Besides, I have also planned to interchange colours of food and juices to disassociate the colours apportioned to fruits. You may pick up a blue juice and it may taste like bananas. This is also a practice to make people more accepting of new things,” she added.

In the first phase of the exhibition, Lalet has displayed some of her work from Indonesia and will be making around five more portraits with body paint and food with Indian models. The exhibition will be inaugurated at Alliance Francaise de Bhopal on Friday and Lalet will begin her new projects in the coming weeks.

Kota: In yet another attack by cow vigilantes , a 40-year-old man was thrashed by a dozen youths of Gau Rakshak Dal on the intervening night of Wednesday and Thursday on Sarhtal Ghati Road under Sarthal police station of Baran district.

The alleged cow smuggler, Laxminarayan Lodha, who belongs to Nareda village of Rajgarh district in Madhya Pradesh, has been arrested by the police on a complaint filed by Gau Rakshak Dal members.

During questioning, Lodha stated that he had purchased six calves from Baran district and was transporting them to his native village for farming.

A case has now been registered against him for transporting calves in excess of capacity of the vehicle. Lodha was manhandled and thrashed by members of the vigilante group and has sustained injuries, according to the police. But the victim has refused to file a complaint against ‘gau rakshaks’.

“He has been booked under sections 5, 8, 9 of the Cow Protection Act for transporting more calves in excess of the capacity of vehicle,” Sarthal police station SHO Parmanand Meena said.

At least six calves have been rescued from the pick-up vehicle and sent to a local ‘gaushala’, he added.

Police were first alerted about the alleged cow smuggling by the head of local Gau Rakshak Dal Ajay Tyagi at around 1am on Thursday, informing that the vigilantes had stopped a pick-up vehicle packed with calves on Sarthal Ghati Road.

Police reached the spot and rescued six calves and arrested its driver Lodha. Two others who were with him managed to flee from the spot.

“A medical examination has been done on Lodha. If he submits a complaint for being manhandled and thrashed by ‘gau rakshaks, we will register a case,” the SHO said.

A video of the incident too has surfaced in which Lodha can be seen being held by the vigilantes and beaten up severely even as he apologises and says ‘sorry’, claiming that he is not a cow smuggler but a farmer.

Kanhaiya Prabhunand Giri

LUCKNOW: Kanhaiya Prabhunand Giri — the first Dalit to be appointed mahamandaleswar of Juna Akhara after six centuries — is sore over being ignored by the government in the newly-formed Ram Temple Trust.

Speaking to TOI from his ashram in Azamgarh on Thursday, the 32-year-old mahamandaleswar, who took a historic dip at Sangam during Kumbh last year to break the centuries-old caste taboo, said his high post now becomes a “mere formality” as the government has overlooked him while appointing a Dalit member to the trust.

“You put a Dalit on a high post but do not repose faith in him or give him the responsibility when it is required for a grand work. Ayodhya is in UP, Ram Mandir will be in UP and I am from Azamgarh in UP. I should have been consulted and made a part of the trust. Formality na kariye, vishwas jitiye (You need to win our trust rather than indulging in formality),” he said.

Giri said he stood by Ayodhya seers who are also upset over being ignored for the Ram Temple Trust despite their contribution to the Ram temple movement. “Main in santon ke saath hoon. I will hold discussions with them soon,” he added.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Wednesday had announced the formation of a trust for the construction of Ram temple in Ayodhya as mandated by the Supreme Court in its Ayodhya verdict.

The Dalit mahamandaleshwar had claimed during Kumbh that his mission was to ensure “ghar wapsi” of SCs, STs and OBCs who had left sanatan dharm following their exploitation due to a dogmatic caste system.

“Both PM Modi and Union home minister Amit Shah had visited Kumbh and performed rituals but neither of them met me or enquired about me even though I had made history by undertaking a ‘shahi snan,” he added.

The mahamandaleswar had arrived in a golden chariot, flanked by his followers for the holy dip at Sangam last year.

Representative image

JALANDHAR: The United States in 2019 deported 1,616 Indians, the highest in any single year since 2014, according to data obtained from the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). A total of 8,447 Indian nationals were detained in ICE facilities last year for violating immigration laws, information provided last month under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) has revealed.

In 2018, the US immigration authorities detained 9,818 Indians (including 359 women), the highest till now. The same year, 611 Indians were deported from the US.

The ICE data has also revealed that among the 8,447 “ICE initial bookings (sic) of Indian nationals by gender” 422 were women, 8,022 were men while gender of three was not clear to the American authorities. This is about four times when compared with the 2014 number when 2,306 Indian nationals were detained in ICE facilities. Notably, the number of women in the ICE detention centres is increasing almost in the same proportion.

This trend has been highlighted in viral videos of a series of instances involving Punjabi-speaking women and children trying to enter illegally through Mexico last year. In the second week of June last year, a six-year-old girl died in Arizona desert as her mother, who was from Haryana and trying to get reunited with her husband already in the US, had taken her along to illegally cross the American border via Mexico. Later, a video of her mother alighting from a bus, apparently in Mexico, along with some others including another woman and her daughter became viral on social media.

In third week of July 2019, two video clips became viral on social media platforms, especially among Punjabi netizens in which Punjabi men and women were seen crossing a border fence, said to be Mexico-US border, along with their children. They could be heard speaking in Punjabi.

These instances highlighted that not only Punjabi men, but women too were desperate to reach the US and were taking kids along them.

North American Punjabi Association (NAPA) executive director Satnam Singh Chahal had on November 2 sought information from ICE on number of Indian males and females deported every year from 2014 to 2019 and number of males and females of Indian origin in ICE facilities in the same period.

Releasing the information through a letter dated January 30, 2020, FOIA officer Catrina M Pavlik-Keenan stated that ICE has claimed no deletions or exemptions.

“Although there is no record of deported persons belonging to Punjab, it is believed that most are from the region. Growing number of Indian-origin illegal migrants is a serious matter of concern for all of us and the Government of India and State of Punjab as illegal immigrants have been moving through Mexico, Arizona and Texas in the United States. These undocumented persons of Indian origin are hoping to reach the US after expensive, arduous, and often dangerous journeys that can take months or even years and can sometimes be fatal,” he added.

325,['7/02/2020'],Karnataka: Politicians on tenterhooks as IMA probe spreads net,"This story is from February 7, 2020

On Tuesday, the CBI indicted two senior IPS officers

BENGALURU: Politicians allegedly involved in the I-Monetary Advisory (IMA) ponzi scam are on tenterhooks given that bureaucrats and senior police officers are being arraigned. The Central Bureau of Investigation, probing the case, has named three bureaucrats, including an IAS officer, and registered an FIR against two IPS officers and three police officials.

The main accused and IMA founder Mohammad Mansoor Ali Khan is currently in judicial custody.

“It’s heartening that sleuths are investigating some top cops. But, we’re disappointed at the progress as not even a single politician is being brought to book,” said social activist Haris Siddique who is trying to get justice for investors.

R Roshan Baig, disqualified Congress MLA, and former minister and Congress legislator BZ Zameer Ahmad Khan are among politicians who were linked to the scam, as were former chief minister HD Kumaraswamy and former revenue minister RV Deshpande.

Apart from SIT, which probed the case earlier, recording Baig’s statement and CBI questioning Zameer, there has been no action against politicians.

The scam was busted open after Mansoor Ali Khan accused Baig of being a party to the scheme in which 75,000 investors lost about Rs 3,500 crore. Khan alleged that Baig took Rs 400 crore from him and refused to return it. He had also alleged that Baig had promised him to bail him out by using his influence in the JD (S)-Congress coalition government.

Then revenue minister Deshpande had admitted that Baig had arranged his meeting with Khan, when the latter sought a clean chit from the revenue department to avail a Rs 6,000 bank loan. When the revenue department decided to attach the property and put up a public notice about it in November 2018, the Kumaraswamy-led government chose to withdraw the notice. Subsequently, he officially gave a letter of commendation to Mansoor Ali Khan for his social service.

Using the letter, the BS Yediyurappa-led BJP government, that took over in July last year, hinted that Kumaraswamy would be prosecuted.

Baig declined to comment on the allegation that politicians are getting preferential treatment. “I was the one to first demand a CBI probe. Let it do its job,” he said.

AYV Krishna, joint director, CBI, said the investigation will take its own course, adding: “All culprits, irrespective of their post and position, will be be booked.”

JAIPUR: Twenty-four days after they returned from the troubled China’s Wuhan, the epicentre of novel coronavirus (nCoV) outbreak, three medical students were quarantined at an isolation ward in Sawai Man Singh (SMS) Hospital on Thursday. The delay could be a major lapse in preventing nCoV in Rajasthan.Quick in defending the delay in testing, health authorities claimed that these students were not cooperating with them despite repeated efforts made to convince them.Only after chief medical health officer (CMHO) Jaipur-I Dr Narottam Sharma directed his officials in Govindgarh to convince these students for testing for nCoV, the students agreed to undergo the test. “We issued directions to get the test done of these students immediately. If required take the help of the administration (even police),” Dr Sharma told TOI.They were brought to SMS Hospital, where the doctors quarantined them after taking their blood samples.These students had reached Jaipur on January 13 and since then they have been living in Govindgarh. “Two students got their tests done some days ago but three students had refused saying they do not have any symptoms,” said Dr SK Chopra, block chief medical officer, Govindgarh.In Barmer too, health authorities had to make a lot of effort to convince people returning from Wuhan. “Five people returned from Wuhan in Barmer, all of them have been quarantined at the government hospital. Initially, these students showed resistance but they later agreed to cooperate,” said Dr Kamlesh Chaudhary, CMHO, Barmer.Besides, two more people were quarantined in Jodhpur on Thursday.So far, 51 samples of people who returned from Wuhan have been taken and out of those 43 have tested negative and report of eight tests is awaited. Moreover, 6,981 passengers who landed in Jaipur over the last 10 days have been screened. No nCoV positive case has been reported from the state so far.Rajasthan is at high-risk of nCoV as many medical students, along with others, have returned from Wuhan. At a time when Kerala has reported three confirmed nCoV cases, all those returning from Wuhan have been categorised as suspected cases for nCoV.

Nritya Gopal Das (extreme left) with CM Yogi Adityanath

Ayodhya: Twenty-four hours after the Centre announced formation of the Ram temple trust, Mani Ram Das Chawni temple in Ayodhya turned into an epicentre of revolt by seers with 82-year-old mahant and president of VHP-run Ramjanmabhoomi Nyas, Nritya Gopal Das, leading the protests against exclusion of those who spearheaded the decades-old Ram temple movement.

But before the mahant could address a press conference of the sant samaj to air their grievance and chart out a future course of action, a phone call from Union home ministry doused the fire for the time being. Earlier, the mahant expressed anger at not being made a trustee even as he considered himself a front-runner for the apex temple body’s top post. “Those who sacrificed their lives for the temple movement have been ignored,” he told TOI.Before the Delhi hotline crackled, the BJP brass in Lucknow swiftly dispatched three emissaries — BJP MLA Ved Prakash Gupta, Ayodhya Mayor Rishikesh Upadhyay and Ayodhya Mahanagar president Abhishek Mishra — to placate the seers. The agitated sadhus stopped the three BJP leaders from entering Ram Das Chawni temple and forced them to return. Soon, Mahant Nritya Gopal Das summoned an emergency meeting of sadhus and scheduled a press meeting at 5pm, only to cancel the media meet after a call from Delhi.

Talking to TOI, Ayodhya MLA Ved Prakash Gupta said, “We have pacified the mahant after he had a telephonic conversation with Union home minister Amit Shah. Three posts are still vacant in the trust and Mahant Das will be adjusted.”

Mahant Kamal Nayan Das, designated successor to Nritya Gopal Das, said the Vaishnav Samaj had been ignored and the trust is not acceptable. Commenting on the inclusion of Ayodhya royal Bimlendra Mohan Pratap Mishra, he said he was a politician who contested on a BSP ticket. “Mishra did not play any role in the temple movement,” he said. Mahant Suresh Das of Digambar Akhara too vehemently opposed the trust. “Where are those who fought for the Ram temple,” he asked.

Talking to TOI, Triloki Nath Pandey, who holds the decree of Ramjanmabhoomi as mandated by the Supreme Court, said, “Nyas president Nritya Gopal Das and VHP vice-president Champat Rai are an accused in the Babri demolition case. So, they have not been included. By March, their trial will conclude and they will be included in the Trust.”

BENGALURU: Terming the sedition case against a Bidar school and parent over children ’s performance of a play a mockery of democracy, around 100 protesters gathered outside the office of director general and inspector general of police (DG & IGP) in Bengaluru on Thursday. They demanded action against Bidar cops for harassing schoolchildren in the name of investigation.

Lining the pavement outside the office on Nrupatunga Road, the protesters displayed placards asking 20 questions. Tanveer Ahmed, a participant, said, “We have 20 questions for the state police and want them to be answered. It is scary that schoolchildren are being interrogated like adult criminals.”

The questions include, ‘Why no action was taken against those who enacted the play, Demolition of Babri Masjid’ in Mangaluru; ‘Will police monitor plays and other school activities’; ‘What action is the DGP taking against the Bidar SP?’

Later, a delegation of the protesters met DG & IGP Praveen Sood, seeking his intervention in the matter. “Police in uniform entered the school and thereby violated the juvenile justice law. Where’s the need to question the children repeatedly,” they asked.

“Are Karnataka police scared of children questioning the system and have, therefore, arrested a parent and a teacher in Bidar?” they wanted to know. The protesters claimed Sood has promised to look into the matter.

All this happened while the SDM was sitting inside his office. His nameplate was broken and thrown on the floor. Though the armed miscreants shouted and abused while vandalising the properties, the SDM was not harmed. After the incident, Sapkale had said , “As I am involved in the campaign against mafia in Chattarpur, they may be behind the incident and targeting me.”

Additional SP Chattarpur, Jaiaraj Kuber, said, “During the investigation, we received some important leads when we went through the call records of some of the people allegedly involved in the attack. This will help crack the case.” The police suspect rivalry between two private universities of Chattarpur behind the incident. Officials of one of the universities were booked last month. Owners of both the universities belong to Bandaa and Mahoba districts of Uttar Pradesh. “We have questioned the representatives of these universities,” the ASP said.

Following the incident, all the SDMs posted in the district reached the headquarter and urged action against the people involved in the case. They also threatened to go on strike in case the accused are not arrested in three days. SDM’s office is located right across the SP’s bungalow.

332,['7/02/2020'],‘Defunct’ green lane at Kishanpole to get a repaint,"This story is from February 7, 2020

Jaipur: The Jaipur Smart City Ltd has begun repainting the green corridor which was earmarked for non-motorised vehicles (NMV), along the Kishanpole Road in the Walled City.

This 700-feet long dedicated corridor, which was laid under the Smart Road Project last year, is being renovated this year. But it has largely remained defunct due to encroachments and congested roads. It was expected to provide swift passage to e-rickshaws and cycles in the Walled City area.

CEO of the Jaipur Smart City Ltd, Lok Bandhu said the idea could have been a success, but to remove the encroachment is the responsibility of the Jaipur Municipal Corporation and traffic police. “Our work was to pave the green lane. We do not have any executive powers and other departments have to be vigilant,” Lok Bandhu said.

There is, however, no justification in repainting the corridor. “The road is already congested and I have never seen any e-rickshaw plying on it. Just by painting the corridor green with bicycle symbols is not enough when there is already space crunch in the walled city,” said Ramesh Meena, an e-rickshaw driver.

The 2.2-metre wide green lane is adjacent to the parking area in the market. “Just for the sake of it, they have constructed the lane. The track is constructed adjoining the parking space. There is conflict between cars and NMVs. The civic bodies are wasting public money without proper planning,” said Devendra Singh, one of the shopkeepers at Kishanpole.

333,['7/02/2020'],Rajasthan: People up in arms over rising rape cases of minors,"Locals protest at Kanwat village in Sikar on Thursday against the rape and murder of a 14-year-old girl from t... Read More

TimesView The recent rapes of minors have shown that in most cases offenders were known to survivors/victims. While the police are expected to conduct a swift investigation and bring the accused to trial, the onus lies on parents to ensure the safety of their children. Parents need to be cautious and make sure that their children are not left unattended at any given point of time. This is especially important when there are family functions such as weddings, like the recent rape of a minor at a marriage function in Jaipur, where perpetrators find opportunities to target children.

JAIPUR: The rapes of three minors within days of each other have invoked a sense of anger in the people of Rajasthan, who have now taken to protest against the brutality. Locals in Churu district protested against rape of a 10-year-old girl and completely shut down the town on Wednesday, while villagers in Sikar continued their protest on Thursday.Experts believe that unemployment, bad influence of social media, lack of education and a patriarchal society are the reasons due to which children are being assaulted.The police claim that they are conducting awareness campaigns, but truth remains that they get involved only after the crime is committed.Dr Prerna Puri, associate professor of psychology at Rajasthan University, analysing the present situation said, “The society as a whole has become more self-centric and everyone tends to only think about their own wants and needs. The value system has shattered and moral values are not taught anymore. While we tell our girls that they need to behave in a certain manner, the boys are not told how they have to behave.”Experts also said that parents most of the time do not even report rape or molestation cases, which in turn increases the courage of the perpetrators to repeat these crimes.Puri further added, “Lack of education is a big issue and the minds of the accused in these cases are limited. Pornographic material is easily available on internet now and such individuals have access to it, making them prone to execute crimes like these.”The cops and experts seem to be in agreement when it comes to bad influence of social media.Tejaswani Gautam, SP, Churu, where a 10-year-old girl was raped and left for the dead, said, “Social media has made everyone access content which was not possible earlier. This, added to the fact that in most cases, the accused are mentally unstable in some sense or the other and are likely to be unemployed because of which they have no outlet to take out their frustration and they find easy targets in children.”Officials also lamented that the society has only changed superficially but the core values remain the same and Gautam added, “While we encourage girls to go to school, the ground reality is that the patriarchal system still exists. Men and boys still look at women as well as girls as someone who are only meant for certain things. The mindset is same as it was many years ago.”Meanwhile police say that they try their best to expedite the investigation when they receive the reports. DGP Rajasthan, Bhupendra Singh told TOI, “We are organising outreach programmes to curtail such crimes and the investigation is also done swiftly. However, there has been no increase in these cases and they are reported every year and in these matters, police can do their job only after the crime has been reported.”",jaipur,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73996843,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-797897,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/people-up-in-arms-over-rising-rape-cases-of-minors/articleshow/73993117.cms

LUCKNOW: A man in an inebriated state killed his wife after she refused to have sex with him in Madiaon on Thursday.

According to police, Ram Hirday (35), a daily wager, lived with his wife Munni in a rented house in Rahimnagar . The couple had been married for about 12 years. They had no children.

Recently, said police, Munni had begun suspecting that Ram was having multiple affairs. This lead to regular verbal spats between the two. About four days ago, the couple had a major fight when Munni accused Ram of having an affair with their neighbour.

On Thursday, Ram came home late in an inebriated state and tried to get physical with his wife but she snubbed him. An argument followed and in a fit of rage, Ram strangulated Munni, said police.

Later, he told his neighbours that he was out at night and returned to find his wife dead. However, the neighbours did not believe him and informed police.

Madiaon SHO Vipin Kumar Singh said, “Ram confessed to his crime during interrogation. An FIR of murder has been lodged by Munni’s father.”

Jaipur: Efforts to solve the issue of farmers in Ninder protesting against the acquiring of agricultural land by Jaipur Development Authority (JDA) seems to be in trouble. Ninder Bachao Yuva Kisan Sangharsh Samiti, on Thursday issued a statement that they are putting an end to the talks with the authorities.

“We were ready to solve the issue through discussion but the officials at JDA are busy indulging in cheap politics. Our group was asked to be present in the fourth phase of meeting with the JDA officials on February 6. However, we were informed that JDA officials have invited another farmers’ group for talks, which is not related to our protest or group. This way, the JDA is trying to divide the movement of the farmers. Hence, we have decided to end talks with the JDA,” said Nagendra Singh Shekhawat, leader of the Ninder protest. The protest was started in January 2020 against JDA forcibly acquiring their agricultural land to develop a housing colony.

JDA though has denied such intention to divide the farmers. “We trust CM Ashok Gehlot and MLA Mahesh Joshi. From now on, we will have discussions directly with the government representatives or this agitation will continue,” said Nagendra. TNN

NEW DELHI: A high-voltage campaign, marked by unprecedented vitriol and invectives, for the February 8 assembly polls in the national capital ended on Thursday at 6pm. The die has been cast and now it’s up to the voters.Last two weeks were marked by a blitzkrieg with both AAP and BJP trying to woo voters with rallies, roadshows, corner meetings and door-to-door canvassing across the city. Congress , which, otherwise, had an insipid outing, managed to catch some eyeballs with its top leaders addressing some public meetings in the last few days.Eventually, the entire election seemed to be boiling down to a contest between those who were in “support” of Shaheen Bagh — the site of anti-CAA protests —and those who who were “opposing” it with BJP linking it to national security. References to Pakistan and phrases such as “Jinnah wali azadi and gaddar” were frequently used by candidates and star campaigners of the saffron party. The high-decibel campaign revolved more around national issues like abrogation of Article 370 and 35A, the favourable judgment in the Ram Temple dispute, surgical strike on Pakistan and implementation of CAA even as AAP, the party in power, tried to steer it towards development issues, such as better health, education, infrastructure and clean air.Passions ran high as chief minister Arvind Keriwal was termed a “terrorist”, CAA protesters at Shaheen Bagh — mostly women — were described as potential “rapists” and a Union minister egged on the public to shout a “shoot the traitors” slogan.Election Commission of India found speeches and statements of BJP’s star campaigners violating the model code of conduct (MCC), forcing it to bar three of them — including Model Town candidate Kapil Mishra — from canvassing, addressing public meetings and giving interviews to media for different durations.Taking note of provocative slogans raised by Union minister Anurag Thakur, Election Commission barred him from campaigning for 72 hours while West Delhi MP Parvesh Verma was banned twice – once for 96 hours and again for 24 – for his statement on Shaheen Bagh and calling the chief minister a “terrorist”. Action against Mishra was taken for calling the election a “India vs Pakistan” contest.AAP’s Sanjay Singh, too, got an EC notice for saying that BJP could create trouble at Jamia and Shaeen Bagh on February 2. The EC also wrote to all political parties, urging them to restrain their candidates and make them comply with the provisions of MCC.The social media also witnessed the three players trying to outdo each other with photos, videos and memes, which were often found offensive by leaders of rival parties.Fighting on the development plank, AAP is looking for another term in office while BJP, in exile for 21 years, is desperate to form the next government. For Congress, which governed the national capital for 15 years before being completely whitewashed, it’s a struggle to stay afloat in Delhi politics. The result of the 2015 polls was one-sided with AAP winning a record 67 seats in the 70-member assembly and the remaining three going to BJP. Congress had failed to open its account.BJP campaigned in Delhi with all its might this time around. Apart from an army of over one lakh volunteers, the saffron party brought in over 240 MPs from across the country, chief ministers of 11 states and more than 50 ministers in the Union cabinet during the two weeks of active campaigning.According to a senior party functionary, close to 10,000 corner meetings, padyatras and roadshows were held since January 24, when Union home minister Amit Shah kicked off the poll campaign with a public meeting in west Delhi’s Matiala assembly constituency. He micro-managed the election and himself participated in five to six public events every day.AAP’s aggressive campaign, on the other hand, revolved around its five years in office and work done by the government. Besides door-to-door campaigns, close to 8,000 public meetings were addressed by the party’s top leadership and star campaigners at the assembly and ward levels.“The work done by chief minister Arvind Kejriwal-led Delhi government in the last five years in various sectors, including education, health, power and water remained our main focus. We also told voters our vision for the next five years,” said a senior AAP functionary.While the Congress looked completely out of action initially, its campaign started looking up only towards the end when former party president Rahul Gandhi addressed four meetings in two days.

Jaipur: According to the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) report of 2018, in Rajasthan in 89.2% of cases under Pocso that involved penetrative sexual assault, the offenders were known to the victims. In majority of the cases, the offenders were either family friends or neighbours. The data indicates an alarming trend wherein even those known to the family can turn out to be perpetrators.

For Sections 4 and 6 of Pocso Act, which are about penetrative sexual assault, the NCRB data showed that in 66 cases, the offenders were known to the victim.

In most of the cases in which children are raped, the offenders are known to them which makes it easier for them to lure the child. Also, in few of the cases, the offenders kill the child due to fear of being recognised. This was witnessed not just in the recent cases, but also in the past. Last year in December, a truck driver raped and then murdered a 6-year-old girl. The accused was known to the child and had been drinking alcohol since morning on the day of the incident and after the assault, he dumped the body in bushes. He claimed that he feared being recognised.

Recently a 14-year-old girl was raped allegedly by her neighbour who then strangled her in Sikar on January 27 and after fighting for her life, she died in Jaipur on Tuesday. A total of 488 Pocso cases were registered in 2018, out of which 74 involved penetrative sexual assault. In these cases, 75 victims were girls and one boy. According to the data released by Rajasthan police in January 2020, there was an increase of 22% in cases of rape under Pocso Act in 2019 as compared to 2018.

AI device can cover all landscapes in every weather

LUCKNOW: How many times have insect-lookalike robots in sci-fi movies piqued your curiosity and made you wonder if they’d really help spot the enemy in the future? Well, that wait is finally over.

Meet insect-copter, an artificial intelligence (AI) device weighing only 22gm developed by IIT-Kanpur for what is famously known in the spy world as fly-on-the-wall surveillance.

The indigenous robot technology will be handed over by the premier tech cradle to Indian state-owned aerospace and defence company Bharat Electronics Limited (BEL), which after field trials will spawn the bug for use by the Indian Armed Forces.

Details about this high-end surveillance technology, currently employed in the West, was shared by IIT-K professor Laxmidhar Behera during a seminar on ‘digital transformation of defence services’ at DefExpo 2020 at Vrindavan Yojana on Thursday.

“Our AI bug can fly and spy undetected. It can cover all landscapes in every weather, infiltrate otherwise inaccessible buildings and navigating its own way out of enemy territory. We will hand over the prototype to BEL in March and based on its feedback, the final device will be developed by June,” Behera said. If the seminar augmented curiosity, the simultaneous exhibition at the venue fuelled enthusiasm.

One of the major attractions was the CornerShot gun, manufactured by Adani Defence and Aerospace, which was part of the counter-terror operations in Mumbai during the 26/11 attack. Its purpose is similar to that of the periscope rifle; it allows its operator to both see and attack an armed target, without exposing the operator to counter-attack.

Another highlight was a drone made of special carbon composite material. It comes in a special easy to carry drone backpack for soldiers during anti-terrorist operations.

Prior to bringing a notification for the implementation of Motor Vehicles (Amendment) Act, 2019, the state government has decided to give a gift to the violators of Motor Vehicles Act.

The state government has agreed to withdraw nearly 10,000 such cases during the Lok Adalat to be organised across the state on Saturday. The cases till December 31, 2018, will be withdrawn at various courts and high court benches of Jaipur and Jodhpur. This came a day after transport minister Pratap Singh Khachariyawas promised that two-wheeler riders will get a free helmet from the dealers on its purchase from April 1 onwards

Divulging details on the Lok Adalat, Ashok Kumar Jain, member secretary, Rajasthan State Legal Services Authority, said, “Of the total 10,000 cases in the state, nearly 6,670 are pending in Jaipur (Urban), which would be withdrawn at various metropolitan courts in Jaipur.” At Jaipur, metropolitan magistrate number 27 and 28 will withdraw the cases of MV act. The retracted cases include various violations like traffic penalities, druken driving, seizure of vehicle registration papers and seizure of driving licence. At Jaipur (Urban), Jaipur (Rural), Kota and Karauli, since it is a regular working day in courts, the Lok Adalat will be organised from 1.30pm on Saturday. Apart from the Motor Vehicles Act, nearly 1.67 lakh cases have been identified to be taken up at the Lok Adalat. “Of these 1.67 lakh cases, nearly 42,500 are related to cheque bouncing under the Negotiable Instrument Act,” Jain added.

KOLKATA: The road diversions devised to navigate around the Tallah Bridge shutdown seems to have worked out with waiting time reducing drastically on the new routes. Congestions around Shyambazar and subsequently, C R Avenue—especially on the south-bound flank—have eased considerably as the volume of vehicles there has been distributed to other stretches. But it’s not entirely a rosy scene.Trucks, which are mainly being diverted via Vidyasagar Setu and Belgharia Expressway to the city are leading to jams on the highway, often as far as Salap. Congestions are also being reported on B T Road, near the Indian Statistical Institute, Nivedita Setu and even Sodepur. The situation worsens at night as more and more trucks start entering the city. This, cops said, was the main reason they had been insisting on getting the work on the new level-crossing at the Chitpore yard done at the earliest. “Hopefully, a few trucks will use this other route. With the board exams round the corner—Madhyamik is slated for February 18—we do not want any examinee to get stuck. Specific plans are being drafted,” said a senior officer at Lalbazar. Echoing him, joint CP (traffic) Santosh Pandey said, “There is no denying that Tallah Bridge was an important link between the central and north Kolkata. But alternative routes have been identified for trucks to enter the city. Once the level-crossing is ready, we are expecting a better flow of traffic.”It has so far been decided that traffic load on two key roads—Pran Krishna Mukherjee Road and Seth Pukur Road adjoining the Lockgate flyover and leading to Tallah bridge — would be studied before a plan is finalised once the level-crossing is built.Cops said a second worry was the absence of additional parking space. “The board exams will see a lot of kids going to the exam centres in hired or private vehicles. We need to ensure parking space for the extra vehicles. Each school, which will double as exam centres, is being consulted,” said a Lalbazar officer, adding they were considering whether further restrictions were needed in the Tallah area or not.Work on pulling down the bridge has been on in full swing. One side of the bridge has been flattened out and a new layer of pitch has been laid to ensure heavier mechanical equipment can be moved into the area. “The idea is to use all possible alternative ways that can be utilised once the demolition begins,” said an IPS officer, part of the surveys of the spot. Senior officers said the area around Chitpore and Cossipore was a corridor, where trucks keep moving in and out of the railway yard, and hence, nothing can be planned by keeping them out.",kolkata,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73998663,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-659980,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/waiting-time-on-tallah-diversions-goes-down/articleshow/73994327.cms

344,['7/02/2020'],NMC demolishes 19 illegal dwellings,"This story is from February 7, 2020

Nashik: The anti-encroachment department of the Nashik Municipal Corporation demolished 19 illegal dwellings on a plot of land reserved for a civic school in the Satpur area of the city on Thursday .

The drive started around 7am under heavy police bandobast as the civic body feared retaliation by the squatters. A team of state reserve police force (SRPF) accompanied the local police and the civic officials. Bulldozers were used to raze the illegal structures.

“The drive was carried out at Pimplegaon Bahula village in Satpur that falls under the jurisdiction of NMC . Initially, some of the dwellers tried to resist but the huge police presence ensured smooth conduct of the drive,” civic officials said.

NMC officials said that the occupants of these structures were served notices by the civic body over a month ago to vacate them along with their belongings as the demolition drive would be undertaken anytime.

The owners of these dwellings shifted all their belongings from their houses before the demolition drive started.

“The plot where these illegal structures came up is reserved for a civic school. The local corporators of Satpur have been demanding an NMC-run school constructed on the plot for children in that area,” sources in NMC said.

However, later the civic authorities received a feedback that the dwellings exist on that same plot of land where the elected representatives were insisting to set up a school.

“We sought feedback about the plot of land from the office of the special land acquisition officer of the district revenue department. The latter informed us that the plot was reserved for a civic school. The NMC then decided to get rid of the illegal structures on the plot,” said civic officials .

345,['7/02/2020'],Karnataka: Railways replaces coach factory in Kolar with repair workshop,"This story is from February 7, 2020

The repair workshop can create about 2,000 jobs while a coach factory could have offered about 5,000 jobs

BENGALURU: The proposed factory to manufacture rail coaches in Kolar , 66 km from Bengaluru, has been scrapped and a repair workshop will come up there.

The railways ’ Pink Book , a budget document of detailed allocations of various projects and rail works, released on Wednesday, said Rs 495.3 crore was allocated for setting up a composite repair workshop in Kolar. This means Kolar will get only a railway workshop and not a rail coach factory as earlier proposed.

The factory was first proposed almost a decade ago by then Kolar MP KH Muniyappa, who was Union minister of state for railways. He managed to ensure the project was included in the 2011-12 and 2012-13 railway budgets. However, the project slipped into cold storage later.

In 2014, when Mallikarjun Kharge took over railway minister, he cleared the decks for setting up the factory. In fact, a foundation stone for the rail coach factory was also laid in Srinivasapur taluk of Kolar district that year, but the project continued to remain on paper.

The factory was proposed to manufacture about 1,000 passenger coaches per year. An agreement was signed between the railways and the state government to set up the factory at an estimated cost of Rs 1,460 crore on 1,123 acres of land. The project would have generated about 5,000 jobs. At present, rail coaches are manufactured in Chennai, Kapurthala and Rae Bareli.

Karnataka’s loss: Activists

Activists say a production unit generates more employment than a maintenance facility.

Karnataka Railway Vedike founder-member KN Krishnaprasad said, “This is the first-time the railways is admitting that a repair workshop and not a coach factory will come up in Kolar. The decision to drop a rail factory is a loss for Karnataka, particularly Srinivasapur which is a backward region. A coach factory would have generated huge employment opportunities for people in that area.”

“A workshop will do only secondary maintenance and repair of coaches and the number of jobs that would generate from that would be revealed only after railways releases a blueprint. From the railways’ point of view, three existing well-built coach factories may be enough for their requirements,” he added.

However, a senior SWR official said, “The existing three coach factories meet the requirements and no new proposals have been mooted. The life span of coaches is 20-25 years. The railway board has also decided not to set up new coach factories since it already has surplus capacity. The state government also delayed land acquisition for the project. In fact, the composite repair workshop in Kolar will be a huge facility and generate employment opportunities.”

Will create 2k jobs: MP

Kolar MP and BJP leader S Muniswamy said the workshop will come up in about 530 acres which is already acquired. “This will provide employment to about 2,000 people and sufficient amount has been allocated in the budget,” he said.

Last year, railway minister Piyush Goyal had said, “The rail coach factory set up at Bareli in 2012 was only utilised for refurbishing coaches. The first coach manufactured at this factory came out in 2014. Now, the factory has become a full-fledged manufacturing unit and is slated to produce coaches at 142% of its capacity. Similarly, the coach factory planned to be set up at Srinivasapur in Kolar will be utilised as a workshop for wagon maintenance to start with and in due course, it will be developed into a fully automated unit.”

Jaipur: Hunderds of lawyers affiliated to the district bar association in Jaipur organised a ‘Maun Juloos’ (silent procession) from District Collectorate to Shahid Smarak at the government hospital on Thursday.

Lawyers have been protesting against the shifting of Amber SDM court from the Collectorate to Amber claiming this will affect the litigants, especially of the 136 villages that comes under Amber’s jurisdriction, but are situated on Sikar Road.

Lawyers holding placards participated in a silent procession. “Almost 50 days ago, the Amber SDM court was shifted from the Collectorate to Amber.

This is affecting thousands of villagers, of at least 136 villages that are situated on Sikar Road and Kalwar Road. We will continue to protest against it as it is impractical,” Sunil Sharma, president of the District Advocates Bar Association, told TOI.

“How can you expect the villagers from Sikar Road and Kalwar Road to bypass the Collectorate and reach Amber for their revenue related issues,” he added.

The association has given a written memorandum to chief minister Ashok Gehlot, deputy chief minister Sachin Pilot and state revenue minister Harish Chaudhary in this regard.

On Friday, the lawyers will organise a Sadbudhi Yagya at the Collectorate Circle.

CHENNAI: Every day, techies on Old Mahabalipuram Road play their own version of steeplechase. With a backpack on their shoulders, they run across the road, scale a three-foot- high median and dodge oncoming buses and cabs to reach the foyers of their offices. But they do not know that the city’s IT corridor has been recording the highest number of deaths due to jaywalking over the years.There are 15 foot over-bridges between the Madhya Kailash Junction and Siruseri, one every 1.5km, but they are rarely used. “It (jaywalking) does make me nervous,” said 32-year-old Vinay Nair, a techie working as project manager in one of the BPOs. “I have seen a young man die. But this happens every day in most places across the city,” he said.Vinay is not wrong. It is not just foot over-bridges on OMR, subways on Poonamallee High Road and GST Road remain empty.To reduce pedestrian deaths, the mobility plan policy document for Chennai says the government has planned to double the number of subways and foot over-bridges in the next five years. But there have been no campaigns to encourage people to use the existing facilities even though the number of pedestrians killed in road accidents remains high. More than 1,000 people are killed in accidents every year in Chennai. In 2018, 290 pedestrians were killed.Jaywalking is one among the top reasons for the deaths, police said. Yet, most pedestrians are not booked. “There is a law against jaywalking,” said R T L Chandar, a Madras high court advocate. “Pedestrians can be booked for obstructing traffic under Section 283 of the Indian Penal Code and Section 201 of the Motor Vehicles Act. But police prefer to book motorists (in case of accidents) so that pedestrians, even if they are violators, become eligible for compensation by insurance firms,” he said.Experts said walking, like driving, needed strict enforcement. “The problem is that the pedestrians don’t even think it is a violation or compromise on safety,” said IIT-M professor Ventakesh Balasubramanian, who works with the department of engineering design.“Jaywalking is a product of mob mentality,” said Preethi Manohar, counselor at Sooriya Hospital. “Pedestrians often cross the road in a herd,” she said.Pedestrians who spoke to TOI had their own excuses for jaywalking. Many said they did not want to climb stairs to reach the other side of a road.“We need bridges such as the one at Alandur,” said Antony Ruben, a civic activist from Thiruvottiyur. The Alandur FoB has escalators and stairs. “Stairs in most foot over-bridges are steep. Subways are dingy and ill-lit. Men drink and do drugs inside subways. Women find them unsafe,” he said.Urban planners reject the idea of adding more subways and FoBs and call for more pedestrian-friendly zebra crossings at street level. Aswathy Dilip, senior programme manager, Institute of Transportation and Development Policy, said according to Indian Road Congress guidelines, urban streets should have frequent pedestrians crossings — one every 80m to 150m (commercial areas) and 80m to 250m (residential areas).",chennai,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73999682,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-861130,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/cops-may-not-pull-you-up-but-jaywalking-is-a-crime/articleshow/73993157.cms

AHMEDABAD: The cyber cell of the city police on Thursday arrested a father-son duo from Bhajanpura in New Delhi for the Rs 11 crore cyber fraud , the biggest against a single individual according to the police. A textile businessman Pratap Avtani, a resident of Asavari Tower in Satellite, had lodged a complaint in this connection. The police nabbed Brijesh Giri, 50, and his son Saurabh Giri, 25, who used to work in a private bank as a telecaller. He had got the personal data of the victim while working in the bank, the police said. The complaint was lodged by Avtani on January 24.From March 2016 to December 2019, Avtani was cheated of Rs 11,06,71,824 as he was asked to buy lucrative ‘insurance policies’ of a private bank, and later to pay money for documentations as his investments had ‘grown to Rs 38 crore’.Deputy commissioner of police, Rajdeepsinh Jhala, said the money was transferred to 52 banks in 167 transactions over three years in different accounts. “There are 96 more accused in the case along with 196 account holders in whose accounts the money was transferred. We are hunting for them. We suspect that the father-son duo have cheated more people in the city,” said Jhala. “We have written to banks to freeze the accounts in which the money was transferred,” said Jhala.According to the cyber cell officials, the thugs lured him into buying different life insurance policies, and other investment schemes promising high returns. “During the investigation, we traced the phone numbers from which the duo used to call Avtani. The calls were traced to Bhajanpura in New Delhi.

KOCHI: All work required to prevent flooding in Kochi should be carried out under the aegis of the high-level committee headed by the Ernakulam district collector, the Kerala high court has ordered.Banning all other agencies, such as Kochi corporation and GCDA, from independently carrying out works, Justice Devan Ramachandran said only such a holistic approach would result in a final solution to the flooding. The directive was issued by Justice Ramachandran after considering a petition (WP-C No. 23911/2018) filed by Treasa K J through lawyer K P Pradeep.In the order, the court said: “I further direct that all works being done in the Perandoor Canal and other freshwater canals, except its periodic maintenance and cleaning, shall be done only under the aegis of the high-level committee and with their approval, so as to ensure that the work done by one agency does not stand in conflict with the proposals and work to be done by the others.”The court issued the order after noticing a report filed by Kochi corporation on its project ‘Thevara-Perandoor Canal Rejuvenation’. It was suggested in the report that the canal’s width should be increased from 21.8m to 28.7m on the eastern side of Pandit Karuppan Bridge until Kallupalam and that piling and slab construction in the area have be to commenced immediately. The court said it is precisely because the court does not want individual stakeholders to continue their work that it ordered for constituting a high-level committee, under the provisions of Disaster Management Act. Going by the directives issued by the court earlier, it is ineluctable that the high-level committee has been placed in charge of TP Canal and other freshwater canals, along with the drains in the city, so that they can take a holistic view on their restoration, maintenance, and future works, the court pointed out.Reports filed by amicus curiae Sunil Jacob Jose and Kerala Legal Services Authority (Kelsa) to the court after visiting various stretches of TP Canal had stated that the present condition is very unsatisfactory. The reports had highlighted the conditions at the mouth of TP Canal at Thevara and the culverts under the railway lines crossing the canal at Kammattipadam and Kallupalam. The culverts are only a metre or two in diameter and no steps have been taken by any agency, including Kochi corporation, to clean them for the last several years, the reports had stated. The observations by the amicus curiae and Kelsa in the report on the basis of the inputs gathered from the people of the locality are, prima facie, good, the court said.“The sum total is that even though the corporation appears to have cleaned the Perandoor Canal as is routinely done, these bottlenecks have not been addressed; and therefore, the efforts that have been commenced on the basis of the orders of this court may not obtain full results,” the order stated.A meeting of the high-level committee should be convened by the district collector urgently and appropriate decisions should be taken regarding the aspects mentioned in the reports of the amicus curiae, Kelsa, and Kochi corporation, the court ordered. Decisions so taken and the steps suggested should be informed to the court by the next hearing on February 24, the order said.",kochi,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73997550,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-346588,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/hc-bars-canal-works-by-corp-puts-dist-collector-in-charge/articleshow/73993188.cms
353,['7/02/2020'],‘Garbage trucks’ from Kerala dump tonnes of toxic trash in Mysuru,"This story is from February 7, 2020

Mysuru: Hundreds of tonne of bio-medical waste, plastic and electronic waste from Kerala is being illegally transported across the border through trucks and dumped across Mysuru. While the state pollution control board and district authorities have flagged the violation repeatedly, the trucks continue to get through by bribing the guards at the border check-posts.

The trucks enter Karnataka from the Balavi check-post coming under Nagarahole Tiger Reserve, pass through HD Kote taluk, Moolehole checkpost in Bandipur Tiger Reserve and Gundlupet and reach Mysuru and Mandya, taking the Mysuru-Bengaluru highway.

The truck drivers collect waste – biomedical products, e-waste, plastic, used liquor bottles, clothes and paper – from hospitals, hotels and local businesses in Kerala and conceal it under secured tarpaulin sheets. Evasion is not of essence, though: officials in Karnataka admit palms are greased liberally at the checkposts so trucks get free passage more or less.

The waste is then dumped in various places in and around Mysuru, including on agricultural land, raising fears of contamination of groundwater and spread of diseases due to improper disposal of medical waste.

Karnataka State Pollution Control Board (KSPCB) officials say the smuggling of waste has been happening for the past few decades but the number of trucks has multiplied over the past five years. The drivers make anything between Rs 10,000 and Rs 20,000 per truckload while border staff allow free passage for as little as Rs 500 per truck, said officials. The racket, they added, included prominent politicians, hospital owners, businessmen and hoteliers in Kerala.

Deputy commissioner Abhiram G Shankar pleaded helplessness even as residents have filed several complaints about the risk to public health and environment from the proliferating garbage heaps. “Under the existing law, violators are punished under a compoundable offence (where charges can be dropped) and they get scot-free by paying a meagre fine. They become repeat offenders as there is no deterrent,” Shankar said.

KSPCB environmental officer M G Yathish told TOI that after several letters from the board, the district administration and police had tried to increase the men at the checkposts to inspect the vehicles. “But as the staff allow these trucks without inspecting by taking bribe, they are entering the state and the illegal activity continues without any hindrance,” he said.

“I have instructed police to file FIR against those dumping waste illegally but we are failing to stop such vehicles from entering in the first place. Due to gross violation at Gundlupet checkpost, these trucks are getting a free run,” said Abhiram G Shankar, deputy commissioner.

355,['7/02/2020'],Tamil Nadu: Two Kollywood stars under a cloud,"This story is from February 7, 2020

Money matters of a different kind have put Rajini and Vijay in a spot

CHENNAI: Actors Rajinikanth and Vijay are the top two grossers of the Tamil film industry, with their new films costing Rs 180 crore – Rs 200 crore and collecting Rs 200 crore – Rs 300 crore at the worldwide box office. Money matters of a different kind have now put the two stars in a spot– one for causing losses to distributors and the other for causing loss to the government.

Rajinikanth’s ‘Darbar’ is in the news for a reported loss of around Rs 25 crore for distributors. As distributors complained that their efforts to recover the loss from Lyca Productions or Rajinikanth have been in vain, director A R Murugadoss has sought police protection.

In the case of Vijay, his last Diwali release ‘Bigil’ has come under the scanner of the income tax authorities who conducted simultaneous searches on the premises of the star, the film’s producer, a key distributor and a film financier. “The common thread among all these entities was the success of a recent film which was a box office hit collecting around `300 crore,” said I-T spokesperson Surabhi Ahluwalia in a statement.

While political circles discussed the possibility of the developments being linked to Rajinikanth’s recent utterances and Vijay’s admonition of GST in his film ‘Mersal’, film industry insiders said the two developments were a mere coincidence.

“Distributors asking lead stars to make good their losses in big ticket films and I-T searches in the film industry have been a routine for years,” said a distributor. “A member of the production house had kept harping on how big a hit ‘Bigil’ turned out to be. Naturally, I-T authorities came checking how true those numbers were,” said an exhibitor. Both did not want to be named.

“A substantial portion goes towards GST (18%), local entertainment tax (8%) in Tamil Nadu, theatres’ share and distributors’ commission among others. It might have got Rs 300 crore, but ‘Bigil’ was a loss-maker to most who released the film abroad,” said an overseas distributor of Tamil films.

Political memes referred to the relief Rajinikanth got recently from tax authorities over pending dues and his support for CAA. TNCC president K S Alagiri was more direct. “Developments are happening in the open and behind the screens. They offer relief for Rajinikanth, but summon Vijay from a shooting spot. This is an attempt to silence Vijay, who has a large fan following, mostly youngsters. No one can say there is no connection between the two developments,” Alagiri said.

K Giri Kumar, chairman and CEO of TAAIL, said the company hopes to use the expertise of Ukrainian companies to eventually produce aircraft using 3D printing along with other techniques.

“While it takes several months for an aircraft to be manufactured, this technology will help us deliver within three to four weeks,” he said.

“We would also like to replace traditional titanium with scandium alloy that will reduce weight of the final product by 30%,” said K Giri Kumar, chairman and CEO of TAAIL.

The company, Kumar said, was negotiating with the UP government for past several months and will finally be signing MoU on Friday. “By February 15, we hope to make our first payment. While 4,000 acre has already been acquired for us, the government has promised to acquire remaining 2,000 acre in eight weeks. Our initial investment will be $300 million,” he said.

The aerospace facility will be developed in three phases. In the first phase, the company will set up civil and defence simulators, air charter services and an aero university. For this, an air strip will also be laid. In phase two, an aerospace lab and R&D unit, and manufacturing plants for engines, components and air frames will come up in 900 acres. In the final phase, a maintenance, repair and overhaul facility will be set up, in which the company is expecting to service 1,000 aircraft annually. There will also be an assembly line for aircraft, which, over the next few years, will graduate into a production line.

“A Japanese firm will develop the facility for us. A township for about 3,000 expats will also be made at the site. We have requested the government to set up a container depot since there is no sea access here,” Kumar said.

Oleksandr Chechel, who heads the team in Ukraine, said 80 years have been lost between India and Ukraine. “We would like to use this chance to build political relations with India and bridge this gap,” he said.

358,['7/02/2020'],"Severe staff crunch hits teaching, research work at Mysuru varsity","This story is from February 7, 2020

University of Mysore

MYSURU: One of the country’s oldest varsities, the University of Mysore , faces a severe shortage of professors and other staff, a problem that has hit research work on the campus and raised concerns about the quality of education.

The numbers are staggering: about 75 per cent of positions of professors, 66 per cent of associate professors and 46 per cent of assistant professors are vacant. Overall, the university needs to fill 52 to 55 per cent of posts (teaching and non-teaching) in undergraduate and postgraduate departments.

However, the existing teams are expected to lose more members as some professors and assistant professors are due for retirement later this year.

The prolonged staff crunch — the last formal appointments were made in 2006-07 — has forced the university to rely on the services of guest lecturers.

Without enough full-time professors, the university has been consistently missing out on key research projects for the past 14 years. These are troubling signs for the 104-year-old institute which was supposed to be a role model for other educational centres in the state. The University of Mysore was Karnataka ’s first varsity and the sixth in India.

A university official said a committee of the National Assessment and Accreditation Council (NAAC) had noted the acute staff shortage while rating the varsity. NAAC rates all institutions of higher education.

EC Ningaraj Gowda, a syndicate member at the university, said several attempts were made to fill up vacancies, but successive governments didn’t provide the required support. No one can be hired without the government’s approval.

“We will send a delegation to the state government and request urgent hiring,” he said.

The government’s recent decision to make new appointments only through the Karnataka Examinations Authority is being seen as a stumbling block by varsity officials and academicians. They say that institutions of higher education are autonomous bodies with their own statutes approved by the governor, who is the chancellor of all state universities. All appointments must be made according to provisions of these statutes as mandated under rules, and not through the examinations authority.

University registrar R Shivappa acknowledged that the staff crunch had led to challenges, affecting the quality of teaching. “Students find it difficult to get research guides. We have been requesting the government to fill up the vacancies at the earliest,” he said. “On our end, we have appointed guest faculty members to cope with the situation.”

Guest lecturers can work for only eight to 12 hours a week as against a minimum of 16 hours that a full-time faculty member is granted. The total number of teaching hours at the university has fallen by 25%.

The girl who was spotted by some local residents has now been referred to Haldwani hospital after receiving treatment at BD Pandey hospital. The girl is still on ventilator.Residents told TOI that they heard the girl crying early in the morning. When they came out of their homes, they saw her lying in the drain without any clothes. “Initially, we thought that maybe a child was crying in someone’s house. However, as the crying didn’t stop, we came out and found an infant lying in the drain. Nor did the girl have any clothes on or did she have a hospital tag. We immediately informed police who took her to hospital,” said Rashid, a resident.Officials of BD Pandey hospital told TOI that the girl is barely a day or two old. The doctors added that the infant had several injury marks on her body and is suffering from hypothermia. “Because she was lying in freezing temperature she is suffering from hypothermia and had several injury marks as well. We estimate her to be barely a day or two old,” said Dr Sanjeev Kharkwal, pediatrician at BD Pandey Hospital.Kharkwal added that the girl is still critical. “Though her condition is still very serious, but there are more than 50% chances of her survival,” he said.Police and the administration, meanwhile, said that they have started an investigation into the case and the parents of the child will be nabbed soon. “Police have been asked to investigate the matter promptly.

Firhad Hakim and councillor and IT advisor Sandipan Saha at the session

KOLKATA: City mayor Firhad Hakim hosted his first Facebook Live session on Thursday, taking questions on civic welfare from scores of citizens for over an hour from 7pm to after 8pm.

After ‘Talk to Mayor’, which started in July last year, this was Hakim’s second attempt at interaction with citizens.

More than 12,000 viewers were part of the interactive audience, who posed their questions at the mayor, live on KMC’s Facebook page. Councillor and IT advisor Sandipan Saha helped Hakim with the process as he answered the queries being posted in the comment section. The session ended with 339 comments, 223 shares and 14,000-odd viewership.

Among some of the major questions was about the lack of hygiene facilities for women in slums and what can be done for women who still did not have access to sanitary napkins. “We have set up sanitary-napkin vending machines at almost all government-aided schools in the city from where sanitary pads can be bought at a nominal cost,” Hakim replied. When another person suggested that similar vending machines be set up at KMC health centres, too, he said: “We will surely act on the advise and try to install them at civic health centres.”

There were questions on plans to protect the environment. Hakim replied that the KMC had already taken up urban-forestry initiatives and set up small urban forests in different locations.

Responding to a question on measures taken to stop wastage of water and to ensure potable drinking water for all, the mayor said, “Our moto is to ensure safe drinking water for all in Kolkata. We have seen a fair amount of purified water being wasted by people who wash cars on the road. We have strictly instructed our officials at all boroughs to take strong action against anyone using drinking water to wash vehicles. They have been told to spread awareness among garage owners to use only unfiltered water.”

Representative Image

KOCHI: A youth’s attempt to project himself as a hero backfired after his concocted story about rescuing a woman from abuse fell flat before the police. He was arrested on Thursday for spreading rumours and raising false alarms.

Alan Thomas (20) had posted a video on the social media a few days ago narrating how he saved a girl after a co-passenger tried to abuse her in a train.

Having introduced himself as an aviation student in a city institute, Thomas said in the video that the girl was in her twenties and was travelling in his coach to Ernakulam. By the time the train reached Ernakulam railway station in the morning, all except him and the girl deboarded the train. Just before the train departed, a man in his forties entered the coach and sat next to the girl though there were several other seats vacant. By the time the train halted at Ernakulam D Cabin, before the south railway station , the man groped the girl. Alan said he went to the girl’s rescue and started hitting the man. In the melee, he broke his nose as well, which started bleeding.

The girl ran ran out of the train and disappeared. Alan went on to claim in the video that he handed over the man to an RPF personnel when the train reached the south railway station, but to his utter shock, he was slapped with attempt to murder charges.

The video ended with his request to share it as much as possible till it alerted the girl whom he had saved so that she could come and corroborate his account and save him from the case which could legally affect his career and application to get a passport .

As the video went viral, RPF noticed it and summoned the youth but neither could he answer their questions satisfactorily nor could he present any evidence to back his claims.

“No such incident happened at our unit in south railway station and no charges were slapped on him. He could not even identify the RPF personnel to whom he claimed to have handed over the man,” said a senior RPF official. District police chief ( Kochi City) Vijay Sakhare also intervened in the issue and directed the police to collect the youth’s statement. After confirming it to be a cooked-up story, the police arrested him. “The youth has been facing some problems with his girlfriend and was perhaps trying to gain some sympathy by concocting a heroic story,” police sources said.

BAREILLY: The fire department and Bareilly Development Authority ( BDA ) will jointly crack down on wedding halls in the city that haven’t acquired no objection certificates (NOC) from the fire department. Of around 350 wedding and banquet halls operational in the city, only a handful meets the guidelines.

Sources at the fire department said a list of wedding and banquet halls in the city which are yet to acquire NOC from the department, or don’t adhere to rules and regulation, is being prepared. Chief fire officer of Bareilly, Chandra Mohan Sharma , said, “Around 350 marriage halls and banquets are operating in the city. Of these, only few have got a legal NOC from our department. Most of them either do not have it, or have not got it renewed. We’ll soon issue notices to the errant owners, asking them to get NOCs from us. Those who have got the certificate will be asked to get them renewed.”

A fire department NOC indicates the building is designed as per norms and regulations and is resistant to fire, or unlikely to suffer from a fire-related disaster. BDA officials said a building must be equipped with all fire safety measures in anticipation of a tragedy.

BDA officials said they are raising awareness among people so that they get their building layout plans approved from BDA before starting construction work. BDA vice-chairperson Divya Mittal said if guidelines are followed and building layout is passed by BDA, the authority ensures that a commercial building mandatorily obtains fire NOC.

Last year, BDA had served a warning notice to Bareilly Municipal Corporation (BMC) for starting construction of a new office building without first getting NOC from the fire department. The authority had to temporarily stall the approval of the building layout plan.

KOCHI: Inaugurating the third edition of the Krithi International Book Fair and Knowledge Festival, noted literary critic and writer M K Sanoo on Thursday said that the search for truth is an unending journey and it does not end with believing in something as perfect truth. “One should have the humility to distinguish what one does not know while amassing more knowledge,” Sanoo said.

In her speech, litterateur M Leelavathi said that we are living in an age where writers have to show that they have the backbone. “It is doubtful whether we will be able to guard freedom with the knowledge that letters give us. Though people like Narendra Dhabolkar, Gobind Pansare, Kalburgi and Gauri Lankesh could guard freedom granted by knowledge, they lost their lives in the course of their battle,” Leelavati said.

The huge book exhibition hall is the main attraction of Krithi. Out of a total of 75,000sq ft total built-up area, the book exhibition hall alone has 46,000sq ft area. Spread across 250 stalls, around 150 publishers are displaying books in almost all categories. Cooperation minister Kadakampalli Surendran said the contemporary world demands literature of defence for the society. “Without the existence of freedom, secularism and democracy, art and literature won’t be able to survive,” he said.

364,['7/02/2020'],GMDA to assess carbon footprint of office hubs,"This story is from February 7, 2020

Gurgaon: The Gurugram Metropolitan Development Authority (GMDA) has started a survey to assess the carbon footprint of the city’s major commercial hubs — Udyog Vihar, Cyber City and DLF-4. GMDA will also study different factors such as the number of people per building, vehicles used, consumption of electricity and diesel, and pollution levels in these areas.

Once these figures are collected, they can be used to estimate the carbon footprint, GMDA officials said.

For the measurement of air pollution levels, the civic body will use its recently-installed, low-cost air quality monitors.

“We have asked our geographic information system (GIS) team to start mapping buildings in commercial areas and ascertain the values of various factors for calculating the carbon footprint. Once we have an idea of the current carbon emission in these areas, we can start on a plan to bring it down,” GMDA additional CEO M D Sinha said.

The team will also study green areas and solar power potential in the commercial hubs. “We have started with assessing the rooftop solar power potential of every building in these areas so that we can work towards utilising clean energy sources,” Sinha added.

Talking about the energy needs of commercial hubs, he said they will also work with the organisations operating in these areas, as well as discom Dakshin Haryana Bijli Vitran Nigam (DHBVN), to understand the power needs and the deficit between the supply and demand. “If there is a significant difference between the supply and demand, companies have to rely on diesel for electricity, which adds to both the carbon footprint and air pollution. In such cases, we can ask the discom to provide uninterrupted power supply,” the additional CEO said.

The issue of irregular supply of electricity in these areas has also been raised by industry bodies several times, who have pressed upon the point that in the absence of uninterrupted power supply, they are forced to rely on polluting diesel gensets.

In the recent pre-budget consultations with chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar, many organisations had highlighted environmental concerns.

Once the team has evaluated the carbon footprints, they will work with the stakeholders concerned to draw up a list of long-term feasible solutions.

For instance, diesel autos in these areas can be replaced by electric vehicles, companies can be asked to introduce shuttle services for their employees to bring down the number of cars per building, green areas can be increased and roads can be vacuumed to reduce dust pollution.

“Once we have identified the major concerns, we can work with the organisations to bring down the carbon footprint as well as the pollution levels. Our preliminary talks with the companies have evoked a positive response. If we have a successful pilot run in one sector, we can eventually scale it up,” Sinha said.

Bhopal: Fear of the spread of novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) remains a clear and present danger in Madhya Pradesh. A high-level state government meeting has been scheduled for Friday.

Test reports of about six suspected patients were still awaited from NIV Pune on Thursday. It includes test reports of a patient who travelled to China. He is under treatment at AIIMS-Bhopal with severe upper respiratory tract infection. So far, no positive case of the deadly virus has been reported from Madhya Pradesh.

Suspected cases have been reported from Gwalior, Indore, Bhopal, Khargone, Mandsaur and Ujjain. With increasing number of suspected cases of 2019-nCoV, the National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) has issued a new clarification that a single upper respiratory tract sample does not rule out the 2019-nCoV infection.

NCDC has directed health officials to keep tracking suspected coronavirus patients for 14 days, even after the test has turned negative. A new directive on the Union minister of health website states: ‘Kindly correlate the results with clinical findings. A negative result in a single Upper Respiratory Tract sample does not rule out 2019-nCoV infection. Hence in such cases, a repeat sample should be sent. Lower Respiratory Tract samples (sputum, BAL, endotracheal aspirate) are appropriate samples for 2019nCoV testing especially in severe and progressive lung disease’.

NCDC discharge policy of suspected nCoV cases will now be governed by a patient’s provisional or confirmed diagnosis and it would be up to the treating physician to take a decision. Patient shall be monitored for 14 days after their last contact with a confirmed 2019-nCoV case. A patient from Mandideep, a businessman, suspected for 2019-nCoV, is still lodged in a hotel, said health department sources. Tracking report of other patients is being submitted by respective district health officials on a daily basis.

Jesal Patel

AHMEDABAD: It was 50 excruciating hours for Jesal Patel, 20, a resident of London and a law student at Brunel University. Her ordeal finally ended at the domestic airport in Ahmedabad on Thursday evening. Jesal, who had come out of a locked-down town of China due to the coronavirus scare, will be staying with her uncle’s family for the time being.

Her father Jignesh Patel told TOI that Jesal was on an internship with one of the top law firms in Shanghai as part of her course requirement. “She was living with a Chinese family that was very supportive. When the scare over the virus began, they relocated to Xinjiang, five hours from Shanghai. The cities and towns were getting locked down one after another,” said Patel.

The anxious family back in London wanted her back home even as the village in China had not reported any confirmed case. “I then took to social media, reaching out to all the top officials in the UK, seeking her safe evacuation from China. When it did not work, my family came out in support and booked her a ticket from Shanghai, which was not locked down yet, to Delhi — which was available earlier than the one for London,” said Patel, adding that his family including Jesal are all PIO card holders.

The family said that the five-hour taxi journey to Shanghai on February 4 was more expensive than an international flight. “She was subjected to multiple tests where she tested negative for the virus. She boarded a flight from Shanghai to Delhi on the same afternoon and landed at the airport at night. She was told at the airport that she will have to go back to Shanghai due to new directives of not allowing any foreign national travelling from China,” said Patel. Jesal tried to argue that she is a PIO card holder but the authorities remained adamant. She refused to board a flight and instead asked the authorities to arrest her if needed.

“The authorities finally paid heed to her constant requests and allowed her to take a flight to Ahmedabad. She landed in Ahmedabad on Thursday evening,” said Patel.

Mysuru: Candidates contesting the byelection to ward 18 of Mysuru City Corporation have promised to make it a model ward as well as be available to the electorate 24 hours.

Voting for the byelection will be held on Sunday.

Candidates from three major parties—BJP, Congress and JD(S)—are in the fray.

Stakes are high for the BJP as it is seeking to retain its hold over the segment. Given that the segment falls in Chamaraja assembly constituency represented by BJP’s L Nagendra, activists are keen to ensure a win so that the party continues as the single largest party in the corporation. Nagendra has campaigned for party candidate, BV Ravindra.

The Congress, which is seeking to wrest the segment from BJP, is canvassing with former MLA Vasu in the lead. MLC R Dharmasena, deputy mayor C Sridhar and a host of former mayors are campaigning for candidate, R Ravindra Kumar.

Enthused after its candidate was elected mayor, the JD(S) is campaigning with Tasneem Bano and city unit chief KT Chaluvegowda.

The bypoll was necessitated following the disqualification of BJP corporator Guru Vinayak over a ST caste certificate row. Counting of votes will be taken up on February 11.

The candidates have assured the voters that they will be available to them 24 hours a day and will address issues at the earliest.

While BJP candidate BV Ravindra has promised to open an office in the ward for easy access to him, his Congress counterpart R Ravindra Kumar, who lost to BJP in 2018, has assured voters that collection of garbage every day and installing streetlights will be his priority.

For JD(S)’ Swamy this will be his third election. He had contested from the Congress and as an Independent before.

Hunsur misses GTD

Hunsur is all set for the city municipal council election on February 9. Congress which won in the recently held assembly byelection has fielded candidates in all the 31 wards while JD(S) has field candidates in 28 wards and BJP in 22 wards.

The previous term saw Congress winning the council.

BJP which released a separate manifesto for the council has promised that it will find a permanent solution to the long pending civic issues dogging the town.

What has surprised many is the party's failure to field candidates for all 31 wards. According to SD Mahendra, party district unit president, the party didn't find candidates for the Muslim majority wards. “We hope to win 10-15 wards,” he said.

JD(S)’ campaign is led by Devarahalli Somashekar, the party's candidate in the byelection. Locals feel the absence of party veteran GT Devegowda is likely to affect the party’s fortunes.

Curbs in dist

The district administration has imposed prohibitory orders in Hunsur town from midnight of February 8 to midnight of February 9 and midnight of February 10 and February 11. The sale of liquor has been banned during this period in the city and villages. The district administration has also sought postponement of all festivals and celebrations on Sunday.

All in the family

*In ward no. 16, HK Venkatesh is contesting as the Congress candidate while his sibling HK Ganesh is contesting as a BJP candidate from ward no. 26.

*In ward no. 18 and 26 siblings HN Chandrasekar and HN Kumar are contesting as Congress candidates.

*Dhanalakshmamma S and husband Shivaraju who were elected last time are contesting this time too. Both are JD(S) candidates from ward no. 4 and 5 respectively.

Photo for representative purpose only

KOCHI: A new treatment option — coronary shockwave lithotripsy balloon — offers hope to patients who develop block in heart due to severe calcification almost 20 to 25 years after bypass surgery. The usual angioplasty technique is not possible on such patients.

A 76-year-old patient, who had undergone bypass surgery almost 29 years ago, underwent the new procedure at Lisie Hospital , and 90% of the block was removed. This is the first time the technique has been used in Kerala.

Cardiologists at the hospital, who found that the patient’s block was severely calcified, inserted a ‘balloon’ into the coronary arteries of the patient and sonic pressure pulses were delivered via emitters in the ‘balloon’, which weakens and breaks the calcium. After this, the block was opened and stent implanted successfully.

“This would be extremely useful for those suffering from advanced form of coronary artery disease, having angina or heart attack in which the blockages become very hard due to deposit of calcium. This happens in 15% to 20% of patients undergoing angioplasty and stenting, especially those who are old, diabetic, having chronic kidney disease or who had undergone bypass surgery,” said cardiologist Dr Rony Mathew, who headed the team that performed the surgery.

“Such blocks until now were opened with high pressure balloons or by rotablation procedure, which won’t work for deep and extensive calcified arteries. This therapy has made complex angioplasty much safer and quicker,” said Dr Jabir A, who was part of the team.

With this, the total number of cases lodged in the scam has gone up to 52.

Bhopal : Kamal Nath-led Madhya Pradesh government is all set to go for another glamorous event soon, to give a fillip to its brand image. After IIFA awards, which were announced in a mega event at Bhopal recently the government will now host a grand musical event, `Indian Idol', in the state capital later this month. BJP has, however, dubbed the move as misuse of government funds.

“Mere announcement of the International IIFA Awards has given a boost to the state’s tourism industry. The government will now host a musical extravaganza, Indian Idol, in Bhopal. The mega event will be held on February 20 at TT Nagar stadium,"" said state public relations minister, PC Sharma, on Thursday.

“MP had been known for Bhopal gas tragedy till now. Hosting IIFA here will give a global status to the culturally rich state and the heart of ‘Incredible India’. This function is going to provide a new identity to MP,"" Nath had said during the announcement of IIFA, on February 3. Minister Sharma said that forthcoming musical event is also focused on giving a major boost to the tourism sector as music lovers from across the world would choose MP to witness such gala events.

""It will be the 11th grand finale of the contest, where 15 finalists will perform before the public in the presence of celebrities, including Himesh Reshammiya, Neha Kakkar and Vishal Dadlani,"" said Sharma.

The BJP has dubbed the event as overspending by the cash-strapped government. “The government is crying itself hoarse over financial crisis. Now it is trying to favour its `business friends’ at the cost of state funds, in the name of big events and entertainment. It would have been better if they had given preference to distressed farmers and agitating guest scholars, who are sitting on a month-long protest for their justified rights,” said BJP state spokesperson, Rajneesh Agrawal.

Compilation of letters from heroes of Kargil war was a showstopper at souvenir stalls

LUCKNOW: Guess what sold like hot cakes at the souvenir stalls on Day Two of DefExpo 2020 on Gomti Riverfront? The army veterans’ cap . In fact, such high was the demand that both stalls selling the keepsake exhausted stocks in two hours of opening. Kartikey Verma, a student who managed to bag the last piece, couldn’t stop saying how lucky he was. “Some people are offering to pay me a premium for the cap, but I am not going to sell it. I shall take it to school and show it to my friends,” he beamed.

Lady Luck evidently didn’t favour everyone on Thursday. Varun Khati was among those sulking. “I had bought a veterans’ cap yesterday (Wednesday), but gave it to my younger brother who wanted it. I thought I’d buy another today, but they were sold out,” Varun said, adding that he was now planning to trade a comic book for the cap with his sibling.

Apart from the caps, souvenir badges of the armed forces, pencil boxes and notepads with pictures of tanks and missiles were also on demand. Visitor Nakul Khanna said his son had bought 12 navy and IAF badges. “He has a fancy dress competition at school and perhaps plans to floor his friends as a senior defence officer.”

If youngsters and the youth eyed badges and caps, senior citizens browsed pens exclusively used by army officers, wallets, ties and wall clocks.

376,['7/02/2020'],Bill to increase wards in local bodies introduced,"This story is from February 7, 2020

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Kerala assembly, on Thursday, referred to the subject committee the Kerala Panchayat Raj (Amendment) Bill, 2020 and Kerala Municipality (Amendment) Bill, 2020, which are intended to increase the number of wards in all local bodies by one each, despite several points of order raised by the opposition.

Expected to be enacted in the current session, the bills were introduced since governor Arif Mohammed Khan refused to promulgate an ordinance for the purpose last month. “The governor, who returned the ordinance, suggested the government to bring in a legislation instead of an ordinance. The bills are being presented after the governor approved the drafts,” LSGD minister A C Moideen told the assembly, while presenting the bills.

Opposition members’ points of order were on three grounds — violation of Census Act 1948 which prohibits changing administrative boundaries once census procedures are on, the high court judgment in 2015 restricting delimitation before the 2021 census, and the financial memorandums in the bills which dismiss any additional expenditure from the state’s consolidated fund. “The bills are strictly legal, and they are not in violation of the Census Act or the high court verdict,” the minister said.

Moideen clarified that the government was not changing administrative boundaries of panchayats and other local bodies, but only increasing the number of wards, ‘which are not administrative bodies’. “It’s a rectification of the anomaly of the delimitation process the UDF government carried out in 2015, which covered only 82 out of the total 1,200 local bodies,” he pointed out.

The writ petition filed before the high court in 2015 was for delimitation of a panchayat against which the government filed an affidavit for a favourable court verdict, the minister said. “Here, the government has no intention for delimitation of panchayats but for only the wards,” he said. On the minister’s clarifications, speaker P Sreeramakrishnan ruled that the points of orders do not stand and the bill was referred to the subject committee after discussions. The minister also dismissed opposition members’ allegations that the LDF government was making a hasty delimitation of wards eyeing the local body elections to be held in October 2020.

Queried by the opposition, whether the delimitation procedures would be complete before October 2020 for a smooth conduct of the election, Modieen said the matter was being handled by the delimitation committee headed by the election commission.

NASHIK: A ban on entry of heavy vehicles into the city between 8am and 10pm is being planned to address the issue of traffic congestion and accidents, said commissioner of police Vishwas Nangare Patil on Thursday.

“Diversion of heavy vehicles has not only eased congestion in the Dwarka area but also on other roads in the heart of the city,” said the police chief.

Nangare Patil said that such rules have been implemented in bigger cities, and it can be enforced in Nashik too because of increasing number of vehicles and traffic congestion .

The police chief said that an officer of the rank of PSI and four staffers, along with students from an architecture college, have been studying 85 junctions in the city to recommend traffic control measures.

“We are planning to take action against motorists found parking their vehicles on roads. A large number of vehicles can be found parked on the twin service roads along the Mumbai-Agra highway. These vehicles obstruct the flow of traffic,” he said.

Police authorities said the ban from 8am to 10pm would be implemented after talks with traders, adding that heavy vehicles could halt at the truck termini at both ends of the city on the highway. Earlier, drivers would halt near the Octroi posts.

Police said that there would not be any major bandobast in the area for the next two to three months.

The CCTV recording of the entire evening was thoroughly checked and a list of suspects has been prepared

BAREILLY: A jewellery shop owner was shot dead allegedly by unidentified assailants who were wearing helmets in Subhashnagar locality here on Wednesday night. The victim, Kamal Kishore Verma (42), was about to close his shop when two masked men entered and shot him twice. One of the assailants picked up a small bag in the shop, which contained some documents, before the duo fled on their bike.

Kamal Kishore was rushed to the district hospital by his brother with the help of Dial 112 team, but he breathed his last within a few minutes while doctors were attending to him. Police are trying to identify the killers. It is suspected that the assailants were known to the victim as robbery does not seem to be the motive behind the murder.

After getting information about the incident, DIG Rajesh Pandey , SSP Shailesh Pandey and SP (crime) RK Bhartiya rushed to the spot and took stock of the situation. Police have recovered the CCTV footage of the entire incident and found that the assailants fled in the direction of Madinath temple on their bike.

The CCTV recording of the entire evening was thoroughly checked and a list of suspects has been prepared.

Kamal Kishore is survived by his widow, Neelam, son Ansh, 12, and two daughters – Riya, 7, and Lali, 4. He used to live in a joint family. His elder brother deals in the supply of tailoring goods.

Expressing his inability to figure out why Kamal Kishore was killed, his father Omkar Verma said his son did not have any enmity with anyone.

Bhartiya told TOI, “Both killers were carrying pistols and fired three bullets at the victim. The victim seems to have known the assailants as he did not show any signs of panic when they entered his shop. The assailants did not touch any jewellery in the shop and picked up a small document bag. We are investigating the case from all angles and will question family members after the cremation to get details about the suspects. We are trying to find the bike which was used by the killers. Its image may have been captured by other CCTV cameras installed in the market. The assailants will soon be arrested.”

Gurgaon: Six people, including a sub-divisional magistrate (SDM), a naib teshildar and a revenue clerk, have been booked for corruption and fraud. The case was registered upon the direction of a court for illegal registry of flats bought by a buyer belonging to the economically weaker section (EWS) within months of allotment. An EWS flat , according to the rules, can’t be sold in the first five years from the allotment date.

In July 2018, an EWS flat was allotted to a buyer — Kamla in Shishpal Vihar Society in Sector 49 — but within 40 days, the flat was sold to a person identified as Vijay Singh in violation of the rules. Revenue officials, who were aware ofthe rules, executed the registry.

The matter was highlighted by Ramesh Kumar, a resident of Manesar. Kumar raised the issue before chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar during a grievance committee meeting in Gurgaon in November 2018, following which an inquiry was conducted by the additional deputy commissioner of Gurgaon, and the report was submitted to the deputy commissioner in May 2019. The report indicted the seller, the buyer and the officials and staff of the tehshil office of Badshapur for impropriety. It also recommended action against the erring officials. After receiving the report, the deputy commissioner wrote several letters to the SDM between June and November last year to initiate legal action against “corrupt” officials.

According to the rules, the developer of a private colony has to allot around 20% of the flats or plots to people from economically weaker section at subsidised rates and the allottee cannot sell his property for five years . In this case, the flat was sold within 40 days of handover.

Kumar said when no action was taken by the authorities despite direction from the deputy commissioner, he filed a fresh complaint with the deputy commissioner again seeking action against the accused. He also approached the police with a complaint on January 26, but no action was taken. Finally, he filed a case before Gurgaon court in the first week of February, and taking cognizance of the matter, additional sessions judge Ashwani Kumar on Tuesday directed registration of FIR.

“All accused involved in the criminal conspiracy and corruption committed an offence of fraud by misusing their official position,” said complainant Ramesh Kumar. Upon the direction of the court, a case was registered against allottee Kamla (seller), Vijay Singh (buyer), naib tehshildar Dalbir Dugal, registry clerk Vikash Sharma. The SDM and other revenue officials did not respond to the calls and text messages by TOI, while deputy commissioner Amit Khatri said a case has been registered, and the police will investigate.

BAREILLY: A 42-year-old farmer, who was supposed to appear in court on Friday to record his statement as a witness in rape case of his niece, was found dead in a 1.5 feet deep irrigation canal at Tigra village in Bareilly district’s Hafizganj area on Thursday morning. According to autopsy report, the man is said to have “drowned”.

The farmer’s family has now alleged that he was killed by the accused named in the rape case, which occurred in 2018, as they were scared that his statement would prove them guilty. No arrests have been made so far.

Narrating the incident, the farmer’s son said that his father had gone to the fields to sprinkle water to the crops on Thursday evening. People started looking for him the next morning when he didn’t return home at night. The farmer’s body was then found in the shallow canal adjacent to his crop field. There were no injury marks on the body.

Police could not detect footmarks of any suspect as there were already many people at the spot before their arrival. The family suspected that the farmer was murdered and so they levelled allegations against two suspects. Based on their allegations, the police took the body and sent it for autopsy. The autopsy report stated the cause of death was “due to drowning”.

The farmer’s elder son also said, “There was only 1.5 feet of water. How can someone drown in it? My father has definitely been murdered. He was a witness in a rape case of my cousin and was supposed to appear in court on Friday. We have asked the police to file an FIR against two persons who are also accused in the rape case. They, however, advised us to wait for the autopsy report.”

SHO Hafizganj Mahendra Singh Yadav said, “Prima facie, the farmer was in an inebriated state and could have accidentally slipped into the canal. The autopsy report says that he died due to drowning. We are not aware that he was a witness in a rape case and we are yet to receive any written complaint from the aggrieved family.”

The lake which is considered to be the lifeline of Nainital is, apart from being a major tourist attraction, the source of drinking water for the entire town. The lake also sustains a very sensitive ecosystem and is home to dozens of fish species.

However, over the past few decades, the lake has become a major dumping zone. Recently, a lot of medical waste was also found near the lake.

Speaking to TOI, Nainital district magistrate (DM) Savin Bansal said, “Two boats were given to the municipality by the tourism department at a cost of around Rs 3 lakh. These boats have been used to clean the lake and our data suggests that around 90 quintals of waste was removed from the lake in the past six months.”

The two boats have been used by the Nainital civic body to clean the lake for about eight to ten hours each day and the majority of the waste removed includes plastic bottles, polythene and wood. Officials, however, said that there still needs a lot of work to be done to clean the lake. “The boats have removed a lot of waste but the lake still needs a lot of effort to be cleaned. Our workers are making every effort to clean the lake of all the wastes,” said an official of the municipal council.

Naresh Singh, a resident of Nainital said, “The lake has been polluted by human activities over several decades. Locals have been dumping solid and wet waste into the lake without even considering the effect it will have on drinking water being supplied to the entire town. It’s good that the administration is finally doing something to preserve the ecology of the lake and we hope that these steps will eventually clean the lake.”

The administration, meanwhile, said that they have made several arrangements to clean the lake and the steps will bear fruits soon. “We have installed CCTV cameras along major drains and the comprehensive cleaning of the lake is being done which has led to the improvements in the quality of water of the lake,” Bansal said.

384,['7/02/2020'],Nirma Group pays Rs 213 crore for AMC plot,"This story is from February 7, 2020

Representative image

AHMEDABAD: The much-awaited municipal plot e-auction received a subdued response on Thursday with only one developer, Nirma Group having bought a plot out of the three that were up for auction. The plot was in a posh locality just behind the Rajpath club admeasured 13,476 square metre (sqm) and was offered by AMC at a base offset price of Rs 1.59 lakh per sqm, which translates to Rs 213 cr. If sources are to be believed, Nirma Group is exploring opportunities in real estate business. It has already supported one commercial real estate project in posh Ambli area of the city.

When the auction began at 11am there were initially eight bidders. But strangely, the seven bidders remained inactive online while Nirma quoted Rs 300 per sqm extra over the base rate and bagged the deal for Rs 213.45 cr. On Wednesday, the AMC had in a press release claimed that some 56 persons had shown interest in Thursday’s e-auction. A sluggish realty market is being reasoned for the lethargic response.

Another AMC plot of 13,222 sq m located off the posh Sindhu Bhavan Road where commercial plots had been sold at rates that touched anywhere between Rs 1.7 lakh per sq m to Rs 2.5 lakh per sq m last year —bidders were seen online but they chose to remain inactive even as the AMC quoted a base offset price of Rs 1.59 lakh per sqm. This plot too remained unsold. The third plot, admesuring 15,351 sq m was located in another posh locality on Sola Science City Road and was being offered at base rate of Rs 1.59 lakh per sq m. This plot too did not find takers.

A senior AMC official said that the e-auction was transparent and that no one knew the other bidding parties online. “There is absolutely no question of builder cartels operating to force the AMC to lower the base rates even further. The e-auction was taking place on a transparent platform,” said the AMC official. Sources also claimed that the rate received by the corporation is average and it could have fetched better prices if the market sentiment was bullish.

There are 35 interested developers for Friday’s auction of two plots located in Gota and Nikol areas. “These plots are relatively small and we hope we will be able to get a better price,” said an AMC official.

“The real estate sector did not receive a mention in the recently presented Union Budget. The sector has been going through a tough phase. As a result, the real estate developers have become risk averse,” said a real estate developer.

NAINITAL: In a sight that has worried many officials, a group of tigers in the Corbett Tiger Reserve (CTR) were seen chewing on a plastic drum in the Dhikala range in the last week of January.According to officials, a tigress and her cubs can be seen in the pictures chewing on the plastic drum which they got hold of in the Ramganga river. The picture was clicked by some tourists who handed it over to the CTR administration on January 30.Corbett director Rahul, who goes by his first name only, said, “A group of tourists have given us some pictures where a tigress and her two cubs can be seen chewing on the plastic container. We have ordered an inquiry into the incident and the investigation report will be with us soon.”Corbett is a plastic-free zone and the officials are also investigating as to how the plastic container came into the reserve. “CTR is a plastic-free zone. Even tourists are not allowed to carry plastic products here. Therefore, we are also investigating how the container came into the river. One of the possibilities is that it could have been dumped into the river by residents of one of the many villages along the river,” Rahul said.Ramganga river flows from Gairsain in Chamoli district to Ramnagar in Nainital district and passes through large parts of the CTR. The river is also a source of drinking water to animals in the protected reserve.Meanwhile, officials added that the tigers have been put under monitoring to trace their behaviour. “As a precautionary measure, the tigers seen in the pictures have been put under monitoring. However, no suspected change has occurred in their behaviour as yet,” the official said.Presence of plastic drum in Ramganga river has not only shocked the CTR administration but has also raised questions on the security of the protected zone.Chandrashekhar Joshi, deputy director of CTR, said, “Though an inquiry is on, we cannot ignore the content of the drum. We need to investigate all angles of the incident from poachers plotting to negligence of workers inside the Jhirna zone.”He added that forest officials in hill districts have been alerted to ensure that solid waste is not being dumped anywhere close to rivers. “In the past couple of days, the state witnessed rain and snow and there is a possibility that the drum might have flowed down from the hills with other solid waste,” he said.State forest minister Harak Singh Rawat said, “It is a serious matter and I have directed the officials to give a detailed report on the issue. Those found guilty will certainly be penalised and punished. Any form of plastic will not be allowed in the forests of Uttarakhand as it not only affects humans but also the wildlife.”Scientists of Dehradun-based Wildlife Institute of India (WWI) have repeatedly raised concerns regarding poor solid waste management in the hills. “Instead of treating it, garbage is lifted from one point and dumped in another in the hills. This waste menace has to stop or else it will impact the entire eco-system,” said S Sathyakumar, senior WII scientist.",dehradun,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73998507,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-606437,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/tigers-seen-chewing-on-plastic-container-in-corbett-reserve/articleshow/73990809.cms
386,['7/02/2020'],India should reform offset policy for flexibility: Boeing,"This story is from February 7, 2020

Lucknow: A few days after US Ambassador to India Kenneth Juster called India’s defence offset policy “inefficient”, vice-president (international sales, global sales and defence) of Boeing, Dennis Swanson, on Thursday said companies were facing problems in implementation and India should reform its policy. Speaking at a conference on US-India Partnership for Defence and Aerospace during ongoing DefExpo in Lucknow, Swanson said: “Offsets are a beneficial way to strategically grow within aerospace industry. However, companies are finding it difficult to cover offsets due to the way the policy is drafted and administered.”

He said India should reform offset policy for more flexibility in some areas, allowing Tier 1 suppliers to invest in India.

Swanson, along with other US participants including Lockheed Martin’s director for Asia Dave Sutton and OCD from US Embassy Capt Dan Fillion, also acknowledged tremendous growth in relations between India and US over the past few years, saying that both countries shared a common focus. Sutton said in 2005, there were barely any common trade and defence platforms between the two countries. “Today, our relations have developed tremendously. We get tired and frustrated with both sides working through policy issues, and for that we need to step back and look at the progress that has been made in a relatively short time,” he said.

Capt Fillion said both the countries had overlapping interests like countering terrorism. Fillion said both countries were able to successfully work with each other and, out of roughly $2 billion export by India last year, almost half went to the US.

Claiming there was high potential for India and US to work together, Swanson said some challenges should be overcome to realise potential.

“While there is alignment at senior level, there needs to be stronger alignment down the bureaucratic level and at working level. The US India Business Council has also recommended that India should announce a list of products that will be eligible for more than 49% investment by foreign companies,” he said.

Nashik: Women from the old city area came out in support of the agitators protesting against the Citizenship Amendment Act in Delhi’s Shaheen Bagh on Thursday.

Organised by the Samvidhan Premi Nashikkar and the led by the various leftist organisations, people gathered outside the Idgah Maidan and staged a sit-in for the about two hours in support of all the people who have been protesting against the CAA, National Register of Citizens (NRC) and National Population Register (NPR).

“Zor zulmi ki ladhaai mein sangharsh hamara nara ho (Struggle should be our clarion call in our fight against injustice)”, “Inquilaab zindabad”, “Hame chahiye azaadi”, were the slogans raised by the people here.

Maulana Gufran came down heavily on the central government. “The CAA is anti-national and unconstitutional. The Narendra Modi-led government has failed to provide any succour to the people who have been steadfastly opposing the act,” Gufran said appealing to the people to keep the fight going till the Act is withdrawn.

Aam Admi Party’s Balasaheb Dange also criticised the Centre saying it was diverting the attention from issues like rising inflation. Corporators Samina Memon and Vatsala Khaire also backed the protesters.

Lawyers participating in the agitation said the government was creating a smokescreen of nationalism to hide its failures.

Dehradun: Many passengers, dissatisfied with Uttarakhand Transport Corporation (UTC) bus service, are increasingly taking to social media platforms to vent their ire and reach out to authorities to report their issues. Besides overcrowding and overcharging, many passengers have also complained of rude behaviour by bus drivers and conductors.In a recent social media post, Champawat resident Uma Indira Upadhyay alleged that a UTC bus driver allowed over 100 passengers in a 50-seater bus travelling from Banbasa to Haridwar, a distance of almost 300 km. “Last week, I was travelling from Banbasa to Haridwar in a UTC bus (UK 07 A 1986) and the conductor was letting more and more people enter the bus even though the bus was already packed to capacity. When I told him to not allow more passengers, he sarcastically said that if I pay him Rs 20,000, he would make the trip with no passengers at all,” she said. Upadhyay also shared several pictures of the overcrowded bus along with her post.Another passenger Sanjeev Nigam complained that while he was travelling from Pauri to Dehradun, a bus driver stopped five times for refreshments during the six-hour journey. “The dhabas we stopped at were selling stale food and charging Rs 5 to Rs 10 extra than the printed price for packaged items. When I pointed this out to the bus staff, the driver rudely told me to not eat anything if I didn’t like the food and the price.”Harish Kumar, who took a UTC bus from Haridwar to Delhi, also made a similar complaint in his social media post.“The transport corporation should act on these complaints immediately as UTC buses are the primary means of transport in many areas of the hills,” said another passenger Vimal Karanwal, who travels from Tathyur to Dehradun for work almost thrice a week. When TOI contacted a UTC bus driver who drives on the Dehradun-Uttarkashi route, regarding the charges levelled by passengers, he said, “In hills, passengers are simply waiting to get inside the bus, irrespective of whether it is loaded or not, because of less availability of buses. They criticise us when we don’t stop the bus and they criticise us even when we do.""Meanwhile, reacting to the complaints, Ranvir Singh Chauhan, managing director of UTC, told TOI that passengers should approach the right forums to make complaints if they need solutions. “It is very easy to find the numbers of officials now-a-days. Passengers can call me or send a message/video to me in such cases. If someone just writes his/her experience on social media, how will the department come to know about the issue and act on it?"" he queried.The official added that UTC is soon planning to launch a toll-free helpline number which will be mentioned on all the buses. ""The passengers would be able to register their complaints on the helpline. Meanwhile, our other helpline number 8476007605 is also active,"" Chauhan said.",dehradun,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-47529300,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-110164,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/overloading-in-utc-buses-passengers-take-to-social-media-to-vent-ire/articleshow/73990819.cms

LUCKNOW: A Class VIII student of a CBSE school in Kakori attacked his teacher with a kitchen knife on Thursday, apparently angry over being made to sit in the front row so that he paid more attention to studies.

Class teacher Shyam Gupta managed to escape with gashes on the neck and in the stomach, and is said to be out of danger. The 14-year-old boy is on the run.

Assistant commissioner of police, Kakori, Qasim Abidi told TOI that the student was often scolded by the teacher for his poor academic performance and might have been nursing a grudge for long.

The teenager was evidently infuriated when Gupta decided to keep an eye on him and made him move to the front bench.

“The boy allegedly took out a kitchen knife, which he had brought from home, and attacked his teacher. The latter was injured in the attack after which the boy fled. He has remained untraceable till now (Thursday evening),” Abidi said.

Sources in the school said the teacher was first taken to the Kakori community health centre and later referred to KGMU Trauma Centre, where doctors indicated that the injuries were not life-threatening.

Police said the father of the boy was a tailor by profession, but his maternal and paternal uncles were in jail for murders.

393,['7/02/2020'],Property tax: MC’s notices to PPCC set aside,"This story is from February 7, 2020

Chandigarh: The Punjab and Haryana high court has set aside the Chandigarh municipal corporation’s show-cause notices to the Punjab Pradesh Congress Committee (PPCC), wherein a penalty of Rs 8.4 lakh was imposed on it on arrears of property tax from 2004 to 2010.

The court has also directed the MC to pass an appropriate order in accordance with law. The court order reads, “The present petition stands disposed of and impugned show-cause notices are set aside to enable the respondent to pass an appropriate order in accordance with law. Till the reasoned order is passed, no coercive steps shall be taken against the petitioner.”

PPCC had moved the high court in 2018, seeking setting aside of the MC notices of December 20, 2017, and February 21, 2018, wherein a penalty of Rs 8,36,861 was imposed on it. These pertained to the assessment years 2004-05, 2005-06, 2006-07, 2007-08, 2008-09 and 2009-10, for which no demand notice was received by the petitioner, the PPCC added.

The petitioner’s counsel, Kanwalvir Singh Kang, submitted in the court that the notices were issued after a lapse of over 10 years and before that no demand notice/recovery notice towards the payment of property tax was ever received by the petitioner.

“The petitioner has been paying property tax for the assessment years of which the bill was duly received by the petitioner. Even otherwise when it had come to the notice of the petitioner that there were unpaid arrears of principal amount of property tax, the petitioner had paid Rs 6,48,265. But the MC, despite its own lapse for being unable to raise any demand notice for the last 10 years, suddenly undertook a harsh measure for recovery of penalty of Rs 8,36,681, which is more than the principal amount,” the counsel added.

395,['7/02/2020'],"Suspend census process, opposition tells state government","This story is from February 7, 2020

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The Congress-led opposition in the assembly demanded from the state government to suspend census enumeration process until National Population Register (NPR) fears are allayed. While moving a notice seeking leave for adjournment in the assembly, the opposition alleged that NPR and census have the same questionnaire and hence the state government cannot change questions as promised.

However, chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan said that the state government cannot obstruct the census enumeration process. “The census process will go on. But the state government has ensured that none of the questionnaire in the NPR is incorporated in the census. Directives have been given to all district collectors that no enumerators should carry out activities meant for NPR,” said Vijayan.

Opposition leader Ramesh Chennithala alleged that the state government has no role in the questionnaire and it has been prepared by the census directorate. “The census directorate has started sending letters to the civic body secretaries urging them to appoint enumerators for census. NPR and census directorate are the same now and hence the Centre will issue the questionnaire inclusive of the NPR. The state government cannot do anything on this. Hence, the census operations in the state should be suspended,” he said.

IUML’s M K Muneer said that the state government has not taken the issue seriously. All enumerators, once appointed, will be directly under the census directorate and they can only obey orders of the census registrar. “The chief minister should discuss with officials and review the decisions. All letters by the registrar of census includes mention of the NPR too. Hence, the state government can suspend the census process for not collecting data for the NPR,” said Muneer.

Earlier K M Shaji of the IUML, who issued the notice for the adjournment motion in the House on this, said that in the guise of census enumeration the Centre wants to collect details for NPR too. He said that the state government should protest against this and stop all procedures for census.

Parliamentary affairs minister A K Balan had come with a point of order against Shaji, claiming that he cannot seek the leave for an adjournment motion since he is facing an election case in the Supreme Court. But the speaker overruled this and said he can stay away from voting. “He can attend all the proceedings of the House,” said the speaker. Later, the opposition staged a walkout from the House since the speaker denied permission for a discussion on the notice by suspending the proceedings.

KOCHI: Doctors in the city have been advised against giving fake certificates regardless of their personal obligation to the person demanding it.

As per the guidelines for issuing medical certificates by doctors, IMA- Kochi , has said, “Doctors frequently issue medical certificates as part of their routine work. However, an improperly issued certificate can land them in serious trouble.”

The guidelines were issued after the matter was discussed by IMA-Kochi’s executive committee on January 15, as part of its medical ethics initiative.

Signed by Dr Rajeev Jayadevan , president, IMA-Kochi, it asks doctors to refrain from issuing medical certificate without examining the patient. “The doctor can ask for a request form to be filled stating who is requesting the certificate and for what reason, with the place, date and the requesting person’s signature,” it states.

Doctors have been asked to refer to it while issuing the certificates for ‘discourage illegal requests’.

The letter mentions several ‘illegal’ requests doctors get, including certificates issued to students to take medical leave of absence, those issued to avoid court duty, for driver’s licence, or to obtain undeserving leave from place of work.

They have also been advised to include patient’s signature in the medical certificate.

“A policy about issuing certificates may be displayed in the clinic to discourage those who make illegal requests,” it states.

402,['7/02/2020'],School bullies behind suicidal teens in Chandigarh: Expert,"Representative image

‘Schools can help detect troubled child’

CHANDIGARH: Besides unfulfilled ambitions and failed relationships , school bullies are also a major source of anxiety, frustration, and depression in suicidal teenagers. Adolescent health experts keep receiving these cases.Counsellor Chhaya Prasad, who runs a parental skills guidance clinic, has found children with problem of speech articulation, mispronunciation, and learning disability to be soft targets of bullies in their class. She advises parents to have regular communication with their teenaged children to bring them out of this dejection. Her clinic has adopted six government schools for child awareness.She said: “Symptoms of bullying are in child’s falling attendance, quietness, isolation, bursts of anger, and deteriorating handwriting. If parents interact with their children, they can spot these common signs easily and confront this problem at the initial stage. Spend quality time with children every day to build up their confidence. Talk to them about their friends, teachers, bus driver, and other people they meet. Scan their notebooks daily and consult development pediatricians, if need be.”Between 2015 and 2019, 81 teenagers committed suicide in the city. The grim figures have prompted experts to ask parents, teachers, siblings and friends to look out for warning signs such as poor eating habits, depression, short temper, and mood swings. Psychiatrists at Government Medical College and Hospital, Sector 32, list six reasons why children kill self—academic pressure, frequent break-ups in relationships, poor tolerance and aggression, lack of parental attention, alcohol abuse, and easy access to means of suicide such as firearms.Hanging is the most common mode of suicide, followed by consuming poisonous substances and jumping into lake or off the buildings.Experts say that schools can play a major role in detecting whether a child is troubled or not. On its part, the UT administration has appointed counsellors in government schools to help students cope up with examination stress and observe the signs of suicidal tendencies. They give regular special lectures on stress management to the students of classes V to XII and monitor each of them. During parent-teacher meetings, they tell parents about keeping their wards relaxed.A few years ago, online game Blue Whale was blamed for many suicides among children in the country. In this challenge, a designated curator assigns players tasks over a 50-day period, culminating in the player's committing suicide, for real. However, no confirmed case of a player's committing suicide was reported official in the Tricity.",chandigarh,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73998261,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-113493,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/school-bullies-behind-suicidal-teens-expert/articleshow/73993336.cms
403,['7/02/2020'],Alert ex-soldier helps police nab impostor in Ahmednagar,"This story is from February 7, 2020

Representative image

PUNE: Thanks to an eagle-eyed retired soldier, the Kotwali police have arrested a 45-year-old man, who allegedly posed as a lieutenant colonel in Ahmednagar.

The incident occurred at the Ahmednagar bus station on Wednesday. The retired soldier noticed the impostor’s fake Army uniform, medals and ribbons.

The former soldier, Rajram Gavali, who served in the Mechanised Infantry Regiment of the Indian Army for 24 years, currently works in the control room of the bus stand.

On Wednesday afternoon, the veteran spotted the suspect wearing the Army uniform waiting at the stand. “Since he was in uniform, I approached to help him,” Gavali told TOI over the phone.

During the conversation, Gavali enquired about the man’s service, posting and units. “He told me that he was posted in the parachute unit, but his uniform did not match. This prompted me to examine the service ribbons on the uniform, which were not in proper order. These two factors convinced me that he was not an Army officer,” Gavali said.

He immediately called up the adjutant of the Mechanised Infantry Regimental Centre in Ahmednagar. “While I was on the phone, the man got suspicious. He immediately removed his shirt, put it in his bag and left the bus stand. A duty officer and I chased him for some distance and nabbed him. When we asked him for his identity card, he started abusing us. We took him to a nearby police chowkey, where he revealed his real name,” Gavali further said.

Meanwhile, Army personnel from MIRC and Army intelligence staff soon arrived the chowky and questioned him. “Under questioning, he conceded that he was not an army officer,” Gavali said

“We have recovered one fake stamp of the Maratha Light Infantry, a fake Army uniform, six debit cards, mobile phones with six SIM cards, over Rs10,000 in cash, and duplicate air pistol with 40 rounds from his possession,” a police officer said.

The man has been identified as Sanjay Vithoba Patil, a resident of Haathkhamba village in Ratnagiri.

The police have arrested him under sections 171 (wearing garb or carrying token used by public servant with fraudulent intent), 420 (cheating), 467 (forgery of valuable security, will, etc) and 471 (Using as genuine a forged document) of the Indian Penal Code .

Police said they are in the process of ascertaining the man’s motive. “At the moment, we suspect that the man has duped people by making false promises of helping them get jobs in the Indian army. Our investigation is on,” added the officer.

Last October, the Chandannagar police in Pune booked a cyber-crook, who posed as an Army jawan and duped a man from Wadgaonsheri of Rs84,600 on the pretext of selling him a motorcycle online.

Representative image

PUNE: Solar panels will be installed at government schools in rural areas of Maharashtra to combat frequent power shutdown and improve digital education.

With increasing digitization of schools — e-learning schemes, digital attendance and more — schools need to be self-reliant in terms of electricity to address the need of the hour. To this enbd, the state government will soon install solar panels in every school that would generate 1-1.5KV electricity.

A meeting of state education officials — including commissioner of education Vishal Solanki and school education minister Varsha Gaikwad — was recently held by deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar in Mumbai.

Officials who attended the meeting said the solar panel project would be initiated with the help of Maharashtra Energy Development Agency (MEDA).

Solanki said, “Many proposals were discussed during this meeting. However, decisions on the proposals are still pending. The electricity bills of several government schools in Maharashtra have been pending with the electricity board. Thus many schools do not get power due to a cut-off while some others face shut downs.”

Power supply is a major issue for the schools as the government has introduced various schemes over the past three years, some of which require access to the Internet. Linking of students’ Aadhaar cards with bank accounts, attendance update on a daily basis, e-learning kits screened on digital boards, among others, are a few such examples.

Over 70% of the 90,000 schools across the state have been digitized in five years. But students in several schools have not benefited. Teachers blame outages and poor internet facilities. There has been a demand from schools to the government to provide solar panels to address power shutdown issues for five years. In some schools, fresh packs of LED screens and projectors are left unutilized.

Ahmedabad: A Vastrapur resident, Anant Patel, 60, filed a complaint against a money changer, Vipul Patel of Ranip at Vastrapur police station on Thursday morning. Anant alleged that Vipul, who hails from the same village as the complainant, cheated him of US $600. According to the FIR, Anant had given Vipul US $600 to change into Indian currency at his firm Shree Umiya Forex Pvt Ltd, located at Shreeji Tower. However, the cheque that Vipul had given him had been dishonoured due to insufficient funds, and despite repeated attempts, Anant was unable to get his money from Vipul. Finally, he lodged a complaint under sections 406 and 420 of the IPC. Anant also stated that Vipul had shut down his office.

Inspector Manoharsinh Jadeja of Vastrapur police station said they are looking for the accused.

The FIR states that Anant and his wife had gone to visit their son in Georgia, USA, in February 2019 and had returned in July 2019. When they returned to India, they had US $600 with them, which was part of the money their son had given them for expenses.

According to the FIR, when Anant had given Vipul the money the value of an US dollar was Rs 71.80, and the entire amount to be received was approximately Rs 43,000. Anant received the cheque from Vipul on January 1, 2020, but ultimately deposited it on January 17 upon Vipul’s request. But the cheque bounced.

Chandigarh: Thirteen days after the Punjab and Haryana high court banned the display of designations or description of offices on both private and government vehicles, the Chandigarh administration on Thursday finally issued orders in this regard.

The order reads, “No government or private vehicle will carry words like court, army, airport, navy, police, press, etc.” The order also said no vehicle was allowed to display designations like chairman and vice-chairman, among others.

However, the UT added, “Words like government/ UT administration can be allowed when the occupants are performing government duties.” It clarified that district magistrates, additional district magistrates, doctors, ambulances and fire brigades can display designations or offices only during performance of magisterial or medical duty in emergency situations.

On January 24, the Punjab and Haryana high court had banned display of designations and professions on private as well as government vehicles in city, and asked the police to enforce the directions within 72 hours. Under the order, display of designation/description of office and unauthorised emblems was prohibited. Printing words like ‘court’, ‘army’, ‘press’ and ‘police’ and designations, such as chairman and vice-chairman, was also banned. Only ambulances, fire brigades, police cars and other vehicles used for rescue operations were exempted. Earlier, there was confusion among traffic cops over challaning vehicles with such stickers.

No relief for Kher

The order has not given any relief to city MP Kirron Kher. Claiming special status on account of being an MP, Kher had earlier demanded that she be allowed to use a flag with ‘MP’ written on it on her car. In a letter to the UT adviser on January 27, she had referred to the HC order and said: “Being a Member of Parliament, I have to visit various places across Tricity for official and non-official works. The recognition of my vehicle must be in the knowledge of officials and the general public. Therefore, I must be allowed to fly a flag on my vehicle mentioning ‘MP’.”

Vehicles from other states

Sources said the UT administration was likely to seek guidelines from the Punjab and Haryana high court on Friday on implementation of the order for vehicles coming from other states.

Police say he instigated the mob to attack the six farmers from Ujjain, who had gone to Borlai village in Dhar on Wednesday, looking for some labourers, who had taken advance of Rs 50,000 each to work in their farms, but did not show up.

The labourers attacked them and shouted ‘baccha chor’, which triggered a frenzied mob attack that killed 38-year-old Ganesh Khati, and seriously injured the others.

Chief minister Kamal Nath condemned the violence and asked ministers Jitu Patwari and Tulsiram Silawat to visit the survivors in hospital. Patwari also attended the last rites of Khati.

The state government set up an SIT under additional SP Devendra Patidar, to investigate the crime and law minister P C Sharma said they are mulling a special law to deter lynching. Manawar police station in-charge Yuvraj Singh Chohan, SI Shobharam Patidar and constables Raghvendra, Naval Singh and Chandrashekhar were suspended after the victims gave statements about the late response of police, said the SP.

The barbaric attack sparked outrage across the state and cops from several police stations and the Dhar DRP Line began a manhunt for the accused. Several houses were raided in Borlai, Khirkiya, Junapani and Tirla villages. Nearby dhabas and hotels were also searched all night.

Junapani was the first to be arrested past midnight. Three other suspects — Satiya, Galiya and Roop Singh — were arrested in the morning, police said. Khirkiya and Borlai villages bore a deserted look on Thursday as almost all the men have fled, fearing police action.

Police say 36 people have been named in the FIR after reviewing video footage of gruesome incident. Three police teams are looking for the other accused.

The lynching set Madhya Pradesh politics on the boil, with BJP vice-president alleging that ‘jungle raj’ was prevailing in Congress rule, and Congress hitting back by tweeting an old picture of Chouhan blessing Junapani. BJP said the lynching was a blot on the state’s image. Leader of Opposition Gopal Bhargava said: “The Congress government has failed to control law and order. Madhya Pradesh has been turned into a ‘Talibani’ state.” Chouhan said: “This is a very unfortunate incident. Law and order have been completely destroyed in the state. There is no fear of the law. This is called ‘jungle raj’.”

Congress state media cell chief Shobha Oza retaliated by tweeting a picture of Chouhan with Junapani and said: “Former CM Shivraj Singh Chouhan is mysteriously hiding the fact that it is his hand on the accused sarpanch’s head.”

State Congress media coordinator Narendra Saluja condemned the lynching and said such a crime is a blot on any civilized society. Accusing BJP of “politicizing” a crime, he said: “BJP has done this in the past as well. Be it the killing of a Dalit youth in Sagar or abduction and murder of a minor tribal girl in Chhindwara, BJP has tried to mislead people by misrepresenting facts, which any responsible political party would not do in sensitive cases.”

In most of the crimes that BJP is talking about, the accused were found to be associated with BJP, Saluja said. “In the Manawar lynching , too, the person who incited the mob was Ramesh Junapani, an influential BJP leader of the area, who has been arrested,” he added. BJP’s Dhar district president Raj Barua confirmed that Junapani is a member of the party, but alleged that he was falsely implicated. “He had no role in the violence in Borlai village. Videos show Junapani was trying to stop people from beating those farmers,” he said.

413,['7/02/2020'],Government tables right to burial bill,"This story is from February 7, 2020

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The state government introduced a bill , The Kerala Christian Cemeteries (Right to Burial of Corpse) Bill, 2020, in the assembly on Thursday. This is intended to put an end to the controversy between the Orthodox and Jacobite Christian denominations over the burial of people from rival factions in the churches owned by them.

The bill, which was referred to the respective subject committee, replaced the ordinance issued on January 6 and is set to become an act during the current session of the assembly. “The recent incidents, which saw burial of dead bodies getting delayed due to rift between the two Christian denominations, were a shame on Kerala’s culture. If this continues, it will grow into a major social and religious conflict in the state,” said A K Balan , minister of law and parliamentary affairs, while presenting the bill.

The UDF members, however, opposed referring the bill to the subject committee demanding redrafting the bill as in its current structure, the bill raised concerns among other Christian denominations including the Catholics and referring it to the select committee instead. Legislators including V D Satheesan (Congress) and Mons Joseph (Kerala Congress-M), stressed the need to limit the bill to just two denominations and warned against new social issues if the government tried to interfere in the powers of the church.

The bill was drafted very badly by someone with least knowledge about Christian denominations and their traditions, they said adding that referring it to the select committee seeking public opinion would give the church heads an opportunity to submit their opinions.

Balan, however, said the government’s intention was clear and that the subject committee could make necessary changes to remove practical difficulties in enacting the bill and give more clarity on definitions and terminologies. “The tense situation still remains and the government cannot remain a mute spectator. The subject committee would meet soon to facilitate the legislation during this session of the assembly,” he added.

PUNE: A Highway Safety Patrol (HSP) team stopped an official car of the Maharashtra government at Karad on the Pune-Bengaluru highway on Wednesday afternoon and fined the driver Rs 1,000 for speeding on the same road the previous morning.

Unknown to the team, HSP’s superintendent of police Milind Mohite was travelling in the car. While giving a reward of Rs 500 to the police constable who issued the fine challan, Mohite claimed that he had himself directed the driver to exceed the prescribed speed limit on Tuesday morning as he wanted to check if the patrol team was taking action against speeding and lane-cutting on the highway.

Mohite had travelled in the car from Pune to Kolhapur on Tuesday and was returning to Pune the next day.

The state government has given interceptor vehicles to the HSP and all police units across the state. The teams are armed with speed guns and keep an eye out for speeding and rash and negligent driving on the state and national highways.

Speaking to TOI, Mohite said, “I had gone to Kolhapur to inspect work at the HSP office there. I asked the driver to speed while passing through Karad. I wanted to check how well the ground staff was using the interceptor vehicles and other equipment for taking action against speeding motorists and lane-cutting on the highway. My inspection got over on Tuesday evening and I was returning by the same vehicle to Pune on Wednesday.”

While fining the driver, the HSP team showed him the receipt which also had the photograph of the car. “I rewarded the police constable who issued the challan for executing his duties perfectly. The police must catch and fine government vehicles if they are guilty of speeding and rash driving,” Mohite added.

BAREILLY: As bovine coronavirus (bCov) affects cattle in India, scientists at the Indian Veterinary Research Institute ( IVRI ) are developing a vaccine for it. Scientists said the vaccine for bovine coronavirus is available in a few countries but importing it to India is both difficult and expensive.Bovine coronavirus is a livestock pathogen that causes diarrhoea in calves. Experts said the diarrhoea in calves can cause death and the disease impacts growth of cattle, leading to economic losses. The transmission of bovine coronavirus is through fecal-oral route. “It can be spread among calves if the infected calf contaminates the water, fodder or any utensil. The bovine coronavirus is prevalent across the country,” said an expert.RK Singh, director, IVRI, told TOI, “Bovine coronavirus, rotavirus cryptosporidium , E.Coli are responsible for calf diarrhoea. We are developing a vaccine for bovine coronavirus, rotavirus, cryptosporidium, E.Coli and we have kept a target to make it within a year. Though the vaccine is available in a few countries, it is expensive and importing it is a cumbersome process. Besides, the vaccine developed here will be more effective on Indian pathogens. If a calf is vaccinated, it will get protection for nearly a year.”Meanwhile, a national conference on “Challenges and threats of microbes to animals and humans” was held at IVRI on Thursday. Commenting on novel coronavirus (2019-nCov) which has spread from China, Gurdial Singh, vice-chancellor, Lala Lajpat Rai University of Veterinary and Animal Sciences, said, “Novel coronavirus may have spread after consumption of wild bats. Unlike India, people in China consume raw meat and do not cook it properly.”",bareilly,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74002141,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-89006,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/ivri-working-to-develop-vaccine-for-bovine-coronavirus/articleshow/73992017.cms
420,['7/02/2020'],Wayanad forest dwellers cry foul over disparity in relief,"This story is from February 7, 2020

KOZHIKODE: Hundreds of families belonging to the ‘entrapped’ villages located inside Wayanad Wildlife Sanctuary (WWS), who have either relinquished or expressed willingness to part with their lands by accepting Centre’s relocation compensaion of Rs 10 lakh, now feel discriminated against with the state government recently announcing a KIIFB-funded scheme for other forest areas, which has a compensation of Rs 15 lakh.

The new state-government funded relocation package, which will be implemented in the forest divisions of Kannur , Thiruvananthapuram , Mannarkkad and south Wayand, will see 438 families being given compensation of Rs 15 lakh per family to move out. Already, the government has allotted Rs 65 crore for the scheme.

Environmentalists say that the discrimination in compensation would scuttle the ongoing relocation programme in WWS, which is the prime tiger habitat in state. While 378 families have already moved out of the sanctuary accepting the Rs 10 lakh, over 400 families are awaiting the implementation of the programme in their settlements.

With the launch state government’s scheme, many people who have moved out said they were treated unjustly. “I gave up my 2.5 acres at Chettiyalathoor settlement by accepting the Rs 10 lakh compensation per family and the amount was insufficient to purchase agricultural land to continue farming which we had carried out for generations. We had to relocate to Malappuram, where my wife had some land. The state government should not discriminate between people who vacated their lands from inside wildlife sanctuary and those in territorial forest divisions,” said K Sreedharan.

N Badusha, president of the Wayanad Prakrithi Samrakshana Samiti and member of the relocation monitoring committee, said the Rs 10 lakh compensation was grossly inadequate as the families couldn’t even purchase a fraction of land originally owned by them to sustain their agriculture-based livelihoods.

Chief conservator of forests, wildlife (northern region) B N Anjan Kumar said that the department had taken up the matter with NTCA regional office authorities who have said that they have forwarded a proposal to the Centre to increase the compensation for the centrally-sponsored relocation programme to Rs 15 lakh. “Once it is approved, it will be possible to provide extra compensation for the new beneficiaries of the IDWH scheme,” he added.

JAIPUR: Though prices of onions have come down with supply from Maharashtra, Gujarat and parts of Rajasthan, another essential item of kitchen is touching an all-time high price.The price of garlic is between Rs 250 and Rs 300 per kilogram in the retail market. Wholesale traders are expecting prices to come down from April onwards when the fresh crop would be harvested and imported to Jaipur.Traders at the Muhana Mandi in Jaipur attributed the rising prices of the garlic to the poor supply and heavy rainfall which hit the crop. “This year’s supply has been badly affected due to poor production of garlic in Maharashtra, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Gujarat. Compared to 2019, our supply is 30-40% less compared to what we usually get here in Jaipur,” said Abdul Sagir, a wholesaler trader at the Muhana Mandi.The prices of the garlic are showing rising trend since September 2019 when the curtailed supply started from Nasik (Maharashtra), Bhavnagar (Gujarat), Kota (Rajasthan), Jhalawar (Rajasthan) and Bundi (Rajasthan).At the wholesale market, the prices of garlic are ranging between Rs 120 and Rs 160 per kilogram which is being sold at Rs 250 to Rs 300 per kilogram in retail market.“Fresh supply of garlic is expected from the first week of March and as indicated by the farmers of Maharashtra, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Gujarat we will get adequate supply from April onwards.

423,['7/02/2020'],iPas to be implemented across state,"This story is from February 7, 2020

Nashik: The Integrated Planning Office Automation System ( iPas ), which was implemented successfully in Nashik district on a pilot basis, will now be replicated across the state. The system is nothing but movement of files electronically, making the office paperless .

Launched in 2013-14 and completed in 2019, the district planning office has so far executed more than 2,700 works related to various government agencies involving funds from the state government.

“It is a revolutionary system where you can literally carry your office wherever you go. The robust, transparent and easy to use system has put an end to duplication of works, unnecessary delays and bring in balance development across the district,” district collector Suraj Mandhare said.

Now that the system is running successfully, representatives linked to the district planning committee (DPC) will be given log-in rights and citizens will also be given access to the current status of projects.

“With the log-in rights, the elected representatives — members of legislative assembly and council and members of Parliament from Nashik district — will be able to log in and present their proposals,” district planning officer Yogendra Chaudhary said.

“Earlier, the concerned officers from the government offices or MLAs (MLA-Fund) and the MPs (MP-LAD Fund) would present their proposals to the office in hardcopy format which would then move from table to table in the form of files. Either these files would get misplaced or the seniority would be fiddled with. Now, as soon as a complete proposal is filed, all the papers are scanned and a title for the project is created,” the officer said.

The file then moves from desk to desk without having to be carried physically. Also, there is no need to wait for the officer or the employee to be in office or even at the desk to sanction the same.

Even if the sanctioning officer is travelling, he/she will have access to iPas and will be able to take action.

Henceforth, government agencies and the elected representatives can simply complete the formalities from their offices and initiate the set procedure to get a particular work sanctioned or payment released.

The officer also said that the works undertaken would be available for viewing in public domain and they will also have GPS tagged photographs to get the real-time picture. “This will help the administration understand what works were taken where and when and the status of the same. As senior officials move along, the works would pop up on the screen of the computer making them aware of the projects undertaken along,” the officer added.

Acting on specific information, Alwal police and Special Operations Team (SOT) sleuths of Cyberabad arrested KM Samanthakamani (41), a housewife from SBI Officer’s Colony in Moosarambagh and K Renuka (35) of Balaji Nagar in Yapral while they were in possession of a baby girl. “Both women were arrested and the girl was handed over to the staff of Sishuvihar in Medchal. During the custodial interrogation, the two women revealed that the racket was being operated by V Babu Reddy and V Gangadhar Reddy,” said Balanagar DCP PV Padmaja.

Based on the information provided by the two women, police arrested V Babu Reddy (43) from his house in Dammaiguda, V Gangadhar Reddy (33) of Qutbullapur, their associates B Ramesh (30) of Santosh Nagar, M Raja Naik (26) of Guntur district in Andhra Pradesh, J Sunitha (33) of Musheerabad and V Laxmi (25) of Ram Nagar. “We rescued another baby girl from the house of one of the accused. She has also been shifted to Sishuvihar,” the DCP said.

The DCP said that Babu Reddy and Gangadhar Reddy have a criminal record. “Babu Reddy has a case filed against him at Secunderabad railway police station and Gangadhar Reddy has eight cases registered against him in Chandrayangutta, Balapur, SR Nagar, Chatrinaka, Shamshabad and Madannapet police stations for similar offences,” the DCP said.

Gangadhar and Babu Reddy confessed to the police that they have been working as agents at various fertility centres in the city, providing egg donors and surrogate mothers on commission basis to the couples through the staff of fertility centres. “The fertility centres have been providing Rs 3,000 to Rs 5,000 for providing egg donors and Rs 30,000 to Rs 70,000 for providing surrogate mothers,” police said.

While arranging surrogate mothers and egg donors, Babu and Gangadhar met couples who were desperate to become parents and were willing to pay lakhs of rupees for a baby. “The duo activated their network of associates at ground level asking them to look for poor families with multiple girls or women who gave birth to unwanted children. They started buying infants by paying Rs 20,000 to Rs 30,000 to the parents and then selling the baby to couples by charging them Rs 4 lakh to Rs 7 lakh. We have identified the parents of a girl from Yadadri-Bhuvanagiri. Parents of the second girl, who is from Warangal, are yet to be identified as we are yet to nab the absconding accused Seetharam,” the DCP said. Police said they will seek the custody of the accused to see how many children have been sold and if they have also kidnapped any infants.

425,['7/02/2020'],SC lens on waqf’s ‘unlisted assets worth lakhs of crores’,"This story is from February 7, 2020

NEW DELHI: Entertaining a PIL alleging non-enumeration of waqf properties worth lakhs of crores of rupees, resulting in their misuse and illegal transfer to builders, the Supreme Court has sought responses from the minority affairs ministry, all states and waqf bodies . Petitioner-advocates Rauf Rahim and Ali Asghar Rahim presented startling statistics before a bench of Justices D Y Chandrachud and K M Joseph. They said in West Bengal , the value of Shia waqf properties was around Rs 5,424 crore and that of Sunni waqf was Rs 13,126 crore.

In Tamil Nadu , Shia waqf properties were valued at Rs 688 crore while that of Sunni waqf was Rs 99,311 crore. And yet, neither the states nor the waqf bodies had prepared a list of properties, or their current usage, they alleged. The petitioners said the value of waqf properties in other states would be similar or much higher. And yet, no waqf board or state had complied with Section 4(1A) of the Waqf Act, which came into effect on November 1, 2013.

The law mandated every state government to maintain a list of waqf properties after conducting a survey within one year from the 2013 Act coming in to force.

After more than five years, no such survey of waqf properties has been carried out, they said. The petitioners told the SC that Section 4(1) of the Act made it obligatory for a state government to appoint a ‘survey commissioner of waqf’ and as many additional survey commissioners as necessary to enumerate waqf properties. This too had not been implemented, they said.

“It has been reliably learnt that proper records of waqf properties are not maintained by the boards and several such properties have been illegally transferred by waqf board officials who are acting in concert with builders/developers by destroying and/or fudging records,” the petitioners alleged.

Requesting the court to order enumeration of waqf board properties within six months, the petitioners said the survey for this purpose should indicate the list of properties which have been transferred and/or alienated in the past four decades by way of lease, sale or tenancy. “Waqf boards across the country are already taking huge amounts as waqf contribution (up to 7%) and yet are not following statutory requirement of surveying and enumerating the waqf properties,” they said.

Because of this, several tenancies of waqf properties were constantly changing hands at the whims and fancies of muttawallis/waqf board officials who often conspired among themselves to make unlawful gains, they added. “Waqf estates across the country have lost crores to unscrupulous management and officials of waqf boards in this manner and valuable properties have been/are transferred by creating new tenancies for a paltry sum under the nomenclature of development/donation,” the PIL said.

426,['7/02/2020'],Assembly urges Centre to scrap changes to I-T Act,"This story is from February 7, 2020

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Kerala legislative assembly unanimously passed a resolution on Thursday seeking the Centre to withdraw the proposed amendment in the Income Tax Act , ‘which will affect the non-resident Indian (NRI) status of Indian citizens working abroad, especially those working in Gulf countries, and Kerala’s economy’.

As per the Union finance bill tabled in the Lok Sabha on Saturday as part of the Union Budget, the proposal is to amend Section 6 of the I-T Act, 1961, to bring down the minimum residing period in India for being considered as a resident (for income tax purposes) from the current 182 days in a year to 120 days, with effect from April 1, 2020.

“This amendment, intended as a step to prevent tax evasion, will deny a major section of people from Kerala working in Gulf countries an opportunity to come and stay with their families back home. They come and reside in their home country not to evade tax but to handle family matters,” said the resolution presented by chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan.

The resolution pointed out that such an amendment would bring down significantly the income of small-scale NRI entrepreneurs in West Asian countries, ‘who otherwise will have to stay in their residing country for a minimum of 240 days to retain their NRI status .’ “The amendment could also affect people working in oil rigs abroad who have the opportunity to reside in India, thanks to several months of off duty they are eligible for,” it said.

Stressing on the significant contribution by non-resident Keralites (NRKs) to the state’s economy, the resolution said the income thus received from outside contributed to about 15% of the state’s gross domestic product. “The consumption and other expenditures the NRKs make in Kerala during their visits is a major trigger for the growth of sectors including industry and commerce in the state,” the resolution said.

Besides, it has also been proposed to impose tax on NRIs who don’t pay tax in their residing countries, ‘which will adversely affect people working in countries sans individual income tax or with which India doesn’t have double taxation agreements (DTAs)’, the resolution said.

“Though the Centre issued a press release on February 2 (after the state raised its concerns) stating that the amendment was not intended to bring NRIs under the purview of income tax, we cannot expect a different situation if Section 6 of the I-T Act, 1961, gets amended as proposed by the Finance Bill 2020,” the resolution said.

427,['7/02/2020'],Mescom seeks 62 paise more per unit of power sold,"This story is from February 7, 2020

Mangaluru: Power consumers under Mangalore Electricity Supply Company (Mescom) may have to brace for a hike in power tariff come April 1. This is thanks to a move by Mescom, which in its tariff filing before the Karnataka Electricity Regulatory Commission (KERC) for 2020-21, has sought upward revision of 62 paise per unit of power that is sells to its customers spread across Shivamogga, Udupi, Dakshina Kannada and Chikkamagaluru.

Mescom, in its tariff filings, stated that the average cost of supply is Rs 7.6/unit while the average revenue realisation is Rs 7/unit, leaving it with a deficit of 62 paise. The company will debate its case for this upward revision before KERC at the mandatory public hearing that is scheduled at the office of the deputy commissioner here for February 13. The company as on date has received 12 objections to its tariff filings directly, and others are with KERC.

Incidentally, 62 paise hike in power cost for 2020-21 sought is less than Rs 1.4/unit it sought in 2019-20.

The KERC in its tariff order for 2019-20 allowed Mescom to hike the price by 33 paise per unit. The projected annual revenue requirement and expected revenue from existing tariff charges for Mescom for 2020-21 as per tariff order 2019 is Rs 3884.8 crore against revised estimation of Rs 4251.4 crore, leaving it with a deficit of Rs 346.1 crore.

Sources in Mescom, privy to the tariff filings before the KERC, told TOI that with the average load growth across four revenue districts under its jurisdiction in the past five years being 2%-3% against 5%-6% in five years prior to that. Against total consumers across categories of 23 lakh in 2017-18, the company added 1 lakh new consumers in the following fiscal, and this has been approximately half the consumer growth registered in 2018-19 as on date.

On the moderate growth in consumer base and growth in load, sources said this is in keeping with the general trend across power supply companies in Karnataka. Against 4956.9 million units (mu) of power sold in 2018-19, the company is looking at projected sale of 5596.2 mu of power during 2020-21.

Most of this growth in power sales will come from domestic consumers who account for 65%-70% of its consumer base, IP sets 15%, commercial 9% and industrial 0.1%.

The move by Mescom to pare down its transmission and distribution losses from 11.3% in 2017-18 to 10.5% in 2018-19, is expected to come down further in 2019-20, increasing awareness among consumers on power saving measures and use of star rated equipment too has led to a plateauing of power consumption.

With focus on quality power supply, the company is doing everything in its power to meet KERC directions in tariff orders, the sources said.

A cop with the rescued girl Simpi

HYDERABAD: A two-year-old girl who was kidnapped at Thondupally was reunited with her family within two hours on Thursday. Police arrested an autorickshaw driver, S Sandeep, for allegedly kidnapping the toddler.

At 10.20am on Thursday, Sonu Kumar, a worker at a brick kiln in Thondupally, lodged a complaint with the Shamshabad police stating that his daughter, Simpi, went missing while playing in front of the brick kiln around 9.30am.

During preliminary probe, police found that the girl was abducted by an autorickshaw driver. “A ragpicker from Bihar, who was collecting bottles near the brick kiln, saw the girl, who was crying on the road, being taken away by an autorickshaw driver,” ACP, Shamshabad S Ashok Kumar Goud said.

Police teams launched a manhunt to nab the offender and obtained the autorickshaw’s registration number after analysing CCTV footage.

Using the vehicle registration details, police contacted the owner of the autorickshaw, who informed them that one S Sandeep (35) from Maharashtra, was riding the three-wheeler. The autorickshaw owner then took police to Sandeep’s house in Rallaguda area of Shamshabad.

“We found the girl asleep inside Sandeep’s hut. Sandeep tried to fool us by saying that he took the girl home as she was alone on the road. He should have informed police or locals. We have arrested Sandeep and the girl has been handed over to her mother,” the ACP said. “Sandeep is married, but they have no children,” police said.

Representative Image

KOCHI: Construction of a bridge across Vembanad Lake at a cost of Rs 48 crore without approach roads on both sides depicts the sorry state of affairs in Kerala, said the high court .

Justice A Muhamed Mustaque has now ordered the state government to immediately acquire lands on both sides of Nerekadavu Bridge at Vadakkemuri across Kollam-Kottapuram Waterway. Once the bridge is joined with the approach roads, it would provide connectivity between NH-66, at Thurvaoor, and state highway-15 between Tripunithura to Vaikom, at Udayanapuram.

The court considered a petition by 74-year-old NM Thaha of Vaikom through advocate KM Sathyanatha Menon for acquiring lands for approach roads. In the order, the court said, “The case depicts a sorry state of affairs… pointing out lack of coordination among different agencies involved in the construction of a bridge.”

Construction of the bridge between Makkekadavu and Nerekadavu was entrusted to Cherian Varkey Construction Company Pvt Ltd in 2016. The construction started before the acquisition of land for the approach roads. As of now, there is a bridge that is of no use, as per court records.

“… With all common sense, one could understand without acquiring land on both sides, no bridge can be put to use. It is not known why tender was awarded in a haste… This is a case where Court should have ordered for a vigilance enquiry… However, the Court will not be restrained from passing such an order if so warranted. The immediate concern… is acquisition of the land…,” the court said in its interim order.

The court ordered the PWD secretary to take immediate steps for acquiring the land and report before the court by the next hearing scheduled on February 14.

The survivor, who lives in the cantonment area of Bareilly, has claimed she got to know her tormentor in July 2019. He promised to marry her, and between August 2019 and January 2020, they kept having physical relations.

P T Usha

KANNUR: Olympian P T Usha , who represented India in many international sports events, has been named the dean of faculty of sports and physical education of Kannur University . This is the first time in Kerala that a sportsperson gets such an academic honour and Kannur University’s move may be the first in the country although officially it could not be verified.

The name of the Olympian was selected by governor Arif Mohammad Khan , who is the chancellor of the university, from the list of three persons proposed by vice-chancellor Gopinath Ravindran , and this was officially communicated to her on Wednesday. “Though the usual practice is to appoint a dean from the academic circles, we don’t have such personalities in the sports field and hence the decision to appoint Usha, who is an eminent sports personality, with global recognition,” said the VC.

This is an honorary post, and she is not expected to take classes, but she would have a key role in the activities related to the faculty, he added.

“This part of the state can do a lot in sports and since Usha is also from the region, she would be able to give a facelift to the sports scenario here, and we are hopeful that it would benefit the university as well,” Ravindran added.

Usha, who is an alumnus of Kannur sports division at Government Vocational Higher Secondary School here, has won many national international laurels, including Padma Shri , Arjuna Award, Best Athlete in Asia Award, Adidas Golden Shoe Award and World Trophy for best Athlete, to mention a few.

It was the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics that made her a star when she came fourth in 400m hurdles. In that event she lost the bronze by 1/100th of a second. In 1985, in the Asian Athletics Championships held at Jakarta ( Indonesia ), Usha bagged five gold medals, which is a record. Now, she is focusing on her career as a coach and managing her institution, Usha School of Athletics, dedicated to advancing promotion and practice of sports.

Usha said the appointment was a pleasant surprise and she felt honoured. “I’m yet to realize the enormity of the offer, and I’m waiting for more information from the varsity officials in this regard,” she said on Thursday.

Though she would not be able to take classes, she is ready to help the students of the department in whatever ways possible.

Suprajeet Panda being whisked away by the police

HYDERABAD: A 26-year-old degree student was nabbed by the Chilkalguda police at Gandhi Hospital on Thursday for running a clinic as a ‘doctor’ without any proof of qualification.

The accused, Suprajeet Panda, a resident of Uppal, had opened a community cardiology centre at Hanuman Sai Nagar in Uppal.

“He has been using a fake ID card posing as a doctor and was operating a clinic since January 1 this year. The accused was caught after a security guard grew suspicious of Panda when he visited Gandhi Hospital to invite patients to his clinic,” said Chilkalguda inspector AC Balagangi Reddy.

According to the police, the accused was running the clinic without proper degree or documents and charged his patients consultation fee. The accused, in the guise of a cardiologist, would visit Gandhi Hospital and distribute his fake visiting card requesting people to visit his clinic.

438,['7/02/2020'],Ahmedabad police cite rioting to justify Section 144,"Stones and brickbats thrown at cops in Shah-e-Alam area of Gujarat in December last year. (File photo)

AHMEDABAD: While the political leadership has been boasting that there have been no disturbances in Gujarat after the 2002 riots, Ahmedabad police told the Gujarat high court that there had been 496 incidents of rioting in the city in the last three years.City police cited this figure before the high court, to justify its continued imposition of Section 144 of the CrPC and Section 37of the Bombay Police Act, which prohibit the gathering of more than four persons at a public place.City police claimed that removal of these restrictions “would lead to chaos in law and order situation in Ahmedabad”. City police filed an affidavit to this effect to oppose a petition filed by five persons including a faculty member of the Indian Institute of Management, Ahmedabad (IIM-A), challenging the continued imposition of these sections. The petition was filed last month after people were detained from outside the IIM-A campus while protesting the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA). The petitioners claimed that the continued imposition of these sections violate the people’s fundamental rights to express themselves, to protest.The affidavit said Ahmedabad is a very politically and socially active city. Any incident, whether it takes place in or outside Ahmedabad, creates a sensitive situation in the city. “There are many incidents within Ahmedabad as well as outside it, which have created a situation, wherein there have been massive rallies, protests etc. across the streets of Ahmedabad,” the affidavit said, and went on to enumerate agitations that have taken place since 2015, after the Patidar reservation movement.Besides major agitations like the Patidar stir, the post-Una Dalit movement or the mass exodus of people from northern states following a rape case, police cited controversies over events such as the suicide of a Bhadra court employee and the Nithyananda ashram.“There is a history of many incidents of similar nature having serious bearing on peace and public order from 2002 to 2015 also,” the affidavit said.Apart from major protests when rioting took place, police claimed that the number of offences registered for rioting in Ahmedabad was 146 in 2017, 201 in 2018 and 149 in 2019. Still, city police took credit for controlling the violence, “Had the police authority not acted swiftly to control these offences, any of these incidents might have the potential of turning into a major law and order situation.”Interestingly, police also claimed that the application of Section 144 of the CrPC has been made for certain “benign” purposes.",ahmedabad,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73998940,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-174130,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/police-cite-rioting-to-justify-sec-144/articleshow/73993414.cms

Nashik: Various government agencies in the district have drawn sharp criticism from district guardian minister Chhagan Bhujbal for their alleged failure in tackling Godavari pollution problem. He has warned the officials concerned of strict action if they fail to initiate immediate steps to deal with the issue.

Bhujbal and renowned water conservationist Rajendra Singh inspected some stretches of the river in the city on Thursday. They were accompanied by officials from the district administration, the Nashik Municipal Corporation (NMC), the Smart City cell, the Maharashtra Pollution Control Board etc.

Singh, a Magsaysay awardee, was appalled to see the severity of the pollution in the Godavari. He described the river as a “patient on a ventilator support.”

Singh was also upset with the NMC administration that had put up sprinklers to deal with the problem of foam formation — as untreated effluents are directly being released into the river.

“Untreated effluent is draining out directly into the river. Instead of taking corrective measures to improve the river’s health, the authorities are carrying out more concrete works on the riverbed,” Singh said.

Talking to reporters, Bhujbal said Nashik will fail to become a smart city if it did not pay attention to the important issue of cleanliness — including that of the river.

“I have told the officials to ensure that industrial effluents are not discharged into the river without treatment. The officials will face the consequences if they do not implement this rule,” he added.

The district guardian minister has also directed the officials to give him the details of the works done by various agencies to tackle river pollution. According to him, the authorities must stop all concrete construction on the river bed, which, he said, would be a death knell for the Godavari.

Bhujbal has cautioned contractors operating the sewage treatment plants to ensure that the plants operate smoothly. Or else, they would face action. “Our state government is committed to tackle the problem of pollution in different cities and it is working on it seriously,” he said.

The Bombay high court has directed the Nashik administration to deal with Godavari pollution after a city environmentalist, Rajesh Pandit, had filed a public interest litigation a few years back. Pandit, who accompanied Bhujbal and Singh, said the comments should be eye-openers for the officials.

Magsaysay awardee meets yatra participants

Rajendra Singh met with and greeted people taking part in the Aviral Nirmal Godavari Saksharta Yatra, which had kicked off three days ago from the origin point of the Godavari river at Brahmagiri in Trimbakeshwar. The yatra, organised by Namai Goda Foundation to reconnect the river with people, will culminate at the mouth of the river in Andhra Pradesh’s Rajahmundry.

440,['7/02/2020'],Why India lags in tackling online child sex abuse,"Representative image

CHENNAI: The content on the dark web, the part of the internet not indexed by search engines and accessed through specific software, is truly a dark world — offensive, degrading and downright horrific. Navigating through it to access child pornography in anonymity is easy. But, so too is accessing such material on the open internet.Hundreds of groups thrive under the radar on WhatsApp, Facebook and Telegram, exchanging offensive visuals and pornography involving children, toddlers and even newborns. As India grapples with child sex abuse material ( CSAM ) invading digital platforms like never before, the enforcement authorities struggle with very little tools, skills or knowledge to track the criminals online.The sheer digital complexity of the crime requires support of global agencies. For instance, it was Interpol that recently flagged India’s high number of online offences. Strangely though, India is not a member of Virtual Global Taskforce yet. Nor is it a member of the WeProtect, a global alliance with heads of states as members to stop online child sexual abuse and exploitation.Though the country claims to have access to Interpol’s International Child Sexual Exploitation database, of late it depends heavily on US-based NCMEC (National Centre for Missing and Exploited Children) for alerts. Interpol’s database holds more than 1.5 million images and videos and has helped identify 19,400 victims worldwide. It is not clear though if CBI has access to this database.India has neither a ministry of internet safety and security nor eSafety commissioners — all essential to crack down on the offensive websites of dark operators steering a multi-million market that trades in children’s dignity. The ministries of home affairs, external affairs and women and child development coordinate for international cooperation in cracking child offensive sites and hunting down perpetrators of the crime, said Rakesh Maheshwari, group coordinator, (cyber laws and e-security) of the ministry of electronics and information technology. ""We would definitely like to be a part of all these international groups. The ministries are working on it,"" said Maheshwari.Operating without international assistance could prove a tough battle in the cyber world. ""The cyber space does not have boundaries. The offensive content can originate from any country,"" said Cyber Peace Foundation founder Vineet Kumar. ""What’s missing is cooperation among countries, which is essential in cracking the crime,"" said Kumar. His foundation, a civil society organisation and a cyber security think tank, has been working on safety of children online. ""It is not just the dark web. Children are stalked and trapped on surface webs,"" said Vineet.On January 12, an ad-hoc committee led by Congress MP Jairam Ramesh submitted a 21-page report with 40 recommendations on dealing with the ‘alarming issue of pornography on social media and its effect on children and society as a whole’. A suggestion was that Prime Minister Narendra Modi take the lead in building a global political alliance to combat child pornography on social media. ""The committee is obviously not aware that other countries have long since been cognisant of the issue and taken multifarious initiatives in handling this complex crime. In fact, India is just playing catch-up game,"" said Vidya Reddy.The committee also failed to get consensus on a crucial recommendation on safeguards for minors engaged in sexting and selfies. ""This was the only recommendation where we could not get an unequivocal view. So, we kept it open,"" said Ramesh. Some members felt the possession of all sexual material by minors must be banned outright and some felt that young adults between the age group of 16-19 should be covered under this exception. Some others opposed this ban. ""The committee seems to be existing in a time warp, to conflate children watching porn with children used in creating sexual material. We are living in a sexualised world, not just online but in a real-time world too,"" said Vidya Reddy of Tulir, a Chennai-based Centre for the Prevention & Healing of Child Sexual Abuse.In all the rush of hi-tech tracking and trapping offenders, a crucial aspect of creating awareness among children and a specialised counselling of those who have been traumatised are yet to gain traction. ""Teachers, parents and other stake holders should be roped in. Counselling should be high up on the agenda,"" said advocate and cyber victim counsellor Debarati Halder. A proactive approach that begins with providing programmes to prevent prospective offenders from committing a sexual offence against a child, is a step towards a safer environment.",chennai,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73999305,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-557606,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/why-india-lags-in-tackling-online-child-sex-abuse/articleshow/73993417.cms

BHOPAL: The Madhya Pradesh government plans to create a ‘state security adviser’ (SSA), on the lines of NSA. If approved, MP would be the second state in the country after west Bengal to have a special officer for ‘internal security’.

A presentation has been made before chief minister Kamal Nath on this, said sources. According to the proposal, the SSA would be a retired IPS officer who reports directly to the chief minister. He may have a term of three years, with provisions for further extension, sources said.

Perks and privileges would be equivalent to the highest post holders in terms of financial remuneration. Coordinating with NSA would be one of the key responsibilities of SSA, said an officer privy to this information. Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee had created such a post in 2018, giving the SSA sweeping powers over security and law enforcement agencies.

Current SSA of West Bengal is Surajit Kar Purkayastha – retired IPS officer of 1985 west Bengal cadre. Similarly, principal advisor (internal security) there is an MP cadre IPS officer, Rina Mitra , who retired on January 31, 2019. Though a strong case has been made before CM Nath for creating this post, a group of IAS officers in Madhya Pradesh has expressed displeasure, say sources. A senior officer said ‘internal security’ is the Centre’s affair, but state governments can create any post.

KOCHI: K J Justin , who was found dead in the backwaters near Vallarpadam container terminal here on Wednesday was the youngest of the seven children of Kattassery Augustine Joseph and brother of K J Yesudas .

Justin, who is younger to Yesudas by 18 years, was not short on musical talents while he was young but it was never seen beyond stage programmes. “He was better known for his business skills and efficient management of overseas rights of all Tharangini albums,” said Shajan C Mathew , journalist and author of Ithihasa Gayakan, a book on life of Yesudas. According to people close to him, Justin’s business declined after he allegedly lost the rights to manage Tharangini albums. Last year he fell into severe depression after one of his sons committed suicide. Justin is survived by wife Gigi and a son.

The body was initially marked as unidentified but was later identified by brothers of Justin’s wife, Mulavukad police said. His kin had registered a man-missing complaint in Thrikkakkara police station on Wednesday.

Postmortem report concluded that the death was due to drowning and police suspect it to be suicide. “As per his relatives, Justin and family and had debts and the family was not in a position to repay them. He had been showing suicidal tendencies for the past week,” police said. tnn

Ahmedabad: One day ahead of the scheduled date of the now cancelled 40th convocation of the National Institute of Design (NID), members of NID’s governing council met at the institute on Thursday. The meeting lasted a marathon five hours and also had participants join via teleconference.

Sources privy to the developments said the authorities seem to have caved to the pressure of angry students and other stakeholders, and have resolved to hold the convocation. The management was not forthcoming on a possible date though.

All eyes were on the council meeting, even as students from NID’s Bengaluru and Gandhinagar campuses arrived at the Ahmedabad campus, some with parents in tow. One faction of parents and students spoke to the NID director Praveen Nahar about the issue. The director, who has chosen to stay mum about the cancelled convocation, reportedly assured them that ‘the convocation will take place soon’. He reportedly said they are ‘hopeful of announcing the new date by next week’. The NID management continued to dodge mediapersons who tried to meet the director and members of the governing council on Thursday afternoon. Purandar Datta, head of communications and media relations (CMR) at NID, barred the entry of media citing the ‘ongoing meeting’ while refusing access to the director or council members.

“What is the secret NID is hiding? Has the institute cowed to political pressure while teaching students not to shy away from raising their voice in a democracy? The lack of transparency from such an iconic institute is disturbing ,” said a student on Thursday. Students, upset at the cancellation, spent most of the day debating the issue at impromptu meetings.

A few students rued that their parents, who had come to Ahmedabad for the convocation, will not be able to come back again even if the convocation is rescheduled. Meanwhile, mention of 40th convocation vanished from NID’s website. The website till Thursday morning mentioned the 40th Convocation to be held on February 7. The tab disappeared on Thursday.

Nagpur: The transgender community, which often doesn’t get opportunities to speak about its problems, on Wednesday shed light on the trials and tribulations faced by them. “All we ask of you is to respect us and not look at us with fear in your eyes,” pleaded a group of transgenders at an informal interaction organized by the Hindi Mahila Samiti.

The event ‘Kinnaro (transgenders) Ke Saath Kuch Pal’, was held at Mor Bhavan . Samiti president Rati Choubey said, “People look at the transgender community with a different perspective, often with disrespect. They have been existing for thousands of years and their existence is credited to Lord Shiva. There have been mentions of them in the Ramayana, Mahabharata, various Puranas and even the Kadambari. Still, they are ostracized by the society, kicked out of their own homes and left to fend for themselves.”

Choubey laid emphasis on the societal problems which arise due to such thinking. “It causes loneliness, feelings of abandonment and often gives rise to criminal behaviour and other anti-social elements,” she said.

The group of transgenders at the event included Meena Nair (Guruma), Zarina, Karishma, Kareena, Heena, Simran, Rakhi, Reshma and six-year-old Bulbul. They explained that when a family realizes that their child is possibly transgender, they give their children to the community. One of us was given away when she was barely two months old, they said.

One of them said, “We don’t miss our families. We have never even had a chance to see them. So, we don’t know what familial love feels like.”

When Choubey asked them whether they would like to find jobs, they replied in the negative. Still, some of us are trying to educate ourselves. We want to devote time to god and bring light into the world, they said.

Choubey pointed out that though the government had announced and recognized a third gender on April 15, 2014, the transgender community still faces a lot of persecution. She said, “They are ultimately humans with legitimate feelings. Until we improve our mindsets, the society will not improve either.”

The event was conceptualized by Choubey, working president Chitra Toor and Aisha Chatterjee. Joint secretary Neelam Shukla, vice-presidents Rekha Pandey and Sujata Dubey were also present.

""However, in January, 2016, the Centre had advised Assam to examine the cases of all persons covered by various court cases filed in Gauhati HC and release them from detention centres if they satisfy the conditions and requirements of the two notifications issued by the central government on September 7, 2015, exempting such persons by or under clause (c) of sub-section (2) of Section 3 of the Passport (Entry into India) Act, 1920 or from the application of the provisions of the Foreigners Act, 1946 or any rule or order made thereunder,"" Rai added.

Rai said that the apex court had also issued a notification in July last, providing for conditional release of declared foreigners, who have completed more than three years in detention centres.

Gadag: Tourists visiting Gadag usually have these places on their itinerary — Bhishma Lake, Veereshwar Punyashram, ancient temples of Veeranarayan and Trikuteshwar and Binkadakatti Zoo. Now, ‘Muktidham’ is added to the must-visit places, thanks to the efforts of locals and government departments. Muktidham in Betgeri is a cemetery involving Hindu and Muslim graveyards.

Due to its greenery and sustained development, Muktidham has been drawing the attention of environmentalists. What otherwise is meant for graveyards has now turned into a garden for morning and evening walkers and joggers. It is also a favourite spot for children to play, and for elders to catch up. The 22acre cemetery has three lakes, as many borewells, ‘Gourav Ghataka’ and hi-tech washrooms where the visitors can take bath after attending the last rites. It also has an open garden where condolence meetings and national festivals like Indepence Day and Republic Day are celebrated. Martyr Memorial reminds one about the contributions of freedom fighters and the valour of soldiers.

Ganesh Singh Byali, president of Betgeri Muktidham Samiti, said the idea of developing the cemetery was pitched some five years ago to bust myths and fear about graveyards. “The cemetery is unique for the fact that its 18acre accommodates graves for 24 castes of Hindu religion, and 4acre for Muslims. When we approached then district minister H K Patil with the idea of developing it as a garden, he instructed Gadag district administration, Gadag-Betgeri City Municipal Council (GBCMC), Nirmiti Kendra and other government agencies to assist the project. It’s been developed at a cost of Rs 4.50 crore over the last 4-5 years,” he explained.

Samiti member Mohammad Shalgar said Muktidham has a broad message to convey that one will go to soil irrespective of religion and caste. While the last rites are performed, ‘Raghupati Raghav Rajaram’ is played on the 10 speakers put up at different places in the graveyard . “The tranquil and green atmosphere helps console bereaved families. They can also take bath in hitech washrooms. There is a provision to conduct condolence meetings at the garden,” he added.

Advocate William Gundi, a local, said apart from government help, many citizens are contributing for the development and maintenance of Muktidham. “Myself and my wife Sudha involve in gardening activities daily. This gives us immense satisfaction,” he shared.

Hubballi: Unseasonal rain and floods having ravaged nearly two-thirds of the area under chilli cultivation, the price of dry chilli has skyrocketed in the retail market, much to the displeasure of the customers. Data from the horticulture department indicates that, of the 27,000 hectares used for cultivation of chilli across Dharwad district, floods damaged crops across 18,500 hectares.

Neighbouring Gadag district, also renowned for cultivation of chilli, has been adversely affected owing to torrential rain. Of the 13,120 hectares used for sowing of chilli in the district, crops across 11,171 hectares have been destroyed. Fortunately, damage to chilli crop was minimal in Haveri district – crops across 3,130 hectares of the 13,039 hectares used for its cultivation were destroyed.

Managing director of the Karnataka State Spices Development Board Manjunath Narayanpur said that the four districts accounted for a king’s share of the chilli crop grown in the state. “The area we targetted came up to around 1.3 lakh hectares, but the yield was much below our expectations owing to the flood,” Narayanpur said.

He added that the board was keen on promoting the cultivation of spices among farmers, given its profitability. “We are encouraging more ryots to take up cultivation of chilli, and various measures are being taken to increase its production,” said Narayanpur.

The spice board chief said that, in a bid to bridge the gap between the farmers and the customers and to provide a platform, wherein ryots could directly market their produce, a three-day chilli mela was being held in Dharwad starting from Saturday. “The mela is being held by the board in association with the Karnataka Chamber of Commerce and Industries, Agriculture Produce Market Committee, Hubballi and the horticulture department. The mela will be held on the premises of the Moorusavir Math,” said Narayanpur.

Pointing out that this was the tenth edition of the mela, Narayanpur added that nearly 110 stalls would be erected at the venue for farmers. “We will also have stalls for those merchants to market agro-based chilli products,” said Narayanpur, adding that nearly 120 farmers from across North Karnataka had participated in the last edition of the mela, wherein 45 tonnes of dry chilli cumulatively worth Rs 65 lakh had been sold.

Narayanpur said that a national-level enclave would be held in the second week of March, the focus of which would be on taking measures to create awareness on food safety and increase the quantity of dry chilli that can be exported.

The board’s general manager Chidanandappa, deputy director of the horticulture department Ramachandra Madivalar and Karnataka Chamber of Commerce and Industries member BB Patil were among present at the conference.

454,['7/02/2020'],Officials pin hopes on new taxiway to increase traffic at Vizag airport,"This story is from February 7, 2020

Visakhapatnam: With the airport traffic in Visakhapatnam airport coming down following the withdrawal of a number of airlines, airport officials believe that the commissioning of an N5 taxi track will lead to an increase in the number of flight movements.

The annual traffic handled by the Visakhapatnam airport has come down, according to statistics obtained from the Airports Authority of India. The number of aircraft movements saw a decrease with the withdrawal of a number of airlines including Jet Air, Alliance Air, Thai Air Asia and SriLankan Airlines.

The number of domestic aircraft movements up to December 2019 was 12,788, a significant drop from 22,376 movements in 2018-19. The number of international aircraft movements came down to 1,202 from 1,806 in the same time period.

Passenger occupancy in the domestic sector up to December 2019 was 17,22,387, a steep fall from 27,03,261 in 2018-19. Passenger occupancy dropped in the international sector as well, from 1,50,370 in 2018-19 to 96,561 till December 19.

Speaking to TOI, director of Visakhapatnam airport Raja Kishore said, “After the withdrawal of JetAir and other flights, aircraft movements per day came down from 80 to 60. This means that 24% traffic had come down and showed a decline in passenger occupancy.”

“There was a steep decline in passenger occupancy last year. However, we are bridging the gap with other flight operators which will increase connectivity from Visakhapatnam,” added Kishore.

The airport director further said that considering runaway limitations for operating civilian flights, the N5 taxi track will be commissioned in the airport soon. According to Kishore, the new taxi track will facilitate an increased number of flight movements.

“The commissioning of N5 taxi track is an operational solution and will increase flexibility in enhancing traffic movement,” said the airport director while adding that traffic at Visakhapatnam international airport will increase once the number of slots for operating civilian flights is increased. “We expect the number of flights to go from 75 now to 100,” he added.

Dr K Kumar Raja, vice-president of Andhra Pradesh Air Travellers’ Association (APATA) said, “Although there is good demand in Visakhapatnam, operations are limited due to a few restrictions. However, with the new taxi track and expansion of the terminal building, we expect aircraft movements and passenger occupancy to rise in the next financial year.”

“There is a demand for additional movements from flight operators. Addition of international flights is in the pipeline. We have already held discussions with SpiceJet to operate a few more domestic flights to destinations like Bhubaneswar, Nagpur, Chennai and Mumbai. SpiceJet is also waiting for approval to operate its first cargo flight from Visakhapatnam,” added Kumar.

455,['7/02/2020'],"Lawyers demand setting up of CAT, SHRC in Port City","This story is from February 7, 2020

Visakhapatnam: Andhra Pradesh does not have a Central Administrative Tribunal ( CAT ) office nor a State Human Rights Commission ( SHRC ) within its jurisdiction.

Both are still functional from the Hyderabad bench. With the city slated to become the executive capital in future, advocates want that these offices be set up in Visakhapatnam as all major central government offices are located here.

The Central Administrative Tribunal was established under Article 323(A) of the Constitution for adjudication of disputes and complaints with respect to recruitment and conditions of service of persons appointed to public services and posts under the Union government.

All metro cities and most state capitals have a CAT bench, which deals with disputes related to salaries, promotions, pension issues and arrears.

Senior advocate and president of Forum of Legal Professionals, Kuppili Muralidhar told TOI, “There are around 50 central government offices in the city and employees must be over a lakh. Thousands of central government employees work in key establishments such as the steel plant, shipping and port trust, HSL, DCIL, railways, airport, customs, excise, HPCL, insurance offices like LIC, science laboratories like NIO, CMFRI, CIFT and various public sector units. For settling disputes, they have to travel to Hyderabad, where the bench consists of a judicial member, mostly a retired high court judge and one administrative member like a retired IAS officer. Often, these posts are vacant and cases are pending for years.”

“It is high time that AP should have its own CAT, preferably in Visakhapatnam, which is slated to be the executive capital and has the highest number of central government employees in the state. Similarly, the SHRC should also be established in the state comprising a judge and members from the field of law and vacancies should be filled up immediately to address cases,” Muralidhar added.

VISAKHAPATNAM: Mystery shrouds the attack on a Class VII girl of a private school in Rajam of Srikakulam district who has been battling for life on sustaining 80 per cent burns.

Police officers TOI spoke to said they were on the verge of ruling out that it was an attack as the girl alleges because they were “unable to find any evidence” suggesting it was. Police suspect the girl attempted suicide.

The 14-year-old suffered burns near her home in Rajam on January 28 evening after she was allegedly doused with petrol and torched by the two youngsters.

Speaking to TOI, inspector of Rajam Police Station, GS Sekhar said their investigation had ended with no clues coming their way suggesting the incident was an attack. Though we kept quizzing a few persons, we have no leads. “The victim has given different versions to her family members after the incident. The girl initially said two youngsters torched her and later claimed that a senior student was involved in the crime. We have investigated the case from all the possible angles, but it is difficult to establish the girl’s version as the senior student is innocent in the case and the role of suspected persons hasn’t been proved,” Sekhar added. A senior police officer said that a student of the school had rejected the girl’s proposal and the girl was admonished by her teachers and mother after the boy informed the school’s management about what had happened. “The case has turned into a challenge for us, we are looking at all possible angles,” Sekhar said.

The girl has been undergoing treatment in a corporate hospital in Vizag city, where her condition is said to be critical.

Visakhapatnam: The consumer disputes redressal forum, Vizag-I has asked a leading electronic goods dealer and a manufacturer to refund the purchase price of a refrigerator— Rs 22,900 with interest to a consumer from the city. The forum has further asked the two firms to pay Rs 5,000 as compensation and another Rs 5,000 as legal costs.

R Anil Kumar, a resident of Simhadripuram in Visakhapatnam had purchased a refrigerator on November 20, 2017 from this retailer for Rs 22,900. The refrigerator came with a one-year warranty along with four years of additional warranty on the compressor of the refrigerator.

Within eight months, Kumar noticed that fruits and vegetables placed in the refrigerator were decomposing. Kumar lodged a complaint with the service centre associated with the dealership and the service engineers temporarily fixed the problem. However, a few days later, the problem recurred. So Kumar contacted the manufacturer’s service centre whose engineers too came in to fix the problem, but even their fix was temporary.

Exasperated, Kumar finally approached the consumer disputes redressal forum and lodged a complaint. At the hearing, the manufacturing firm entered a counter petition wherein it said that the customer had failed to follow procedure and was unaware of the workings of the refrigerator.

The forum, led by D Leelavathi (president) and KVR Maheswari dismissed the counter petition and observed that the manufacturer and dealer are ‘severally and jointly liable to return the purchase price’. The forum directed both firms to refund the purchase price of Rs 22,900 with 9 per cent interest, pay Rs 5,000 as compensation and an additional Rs 5,000 as legal costs.

MUMBAI: An Uber driver dragged a 23-year-old scarf-clad poet Bappaditya Sarkar, in Mumbai for the ongoing Kala Ghoda Festival and carrying a dafli, to Santacruz police station on Wednesday night as he suspected him to be a communist and a ""danger to the country"".

The police questioned both the driver and Sarkar, but did not initiate any further proceedings after finding no substance in the complaint. Santacruz senior inspector Shriram Koregaonkar declined to comment and said that no case had been registered.

At around 10.50pm, Jaipur-based Sarkar hailed the cab for a ride from Silver Beach in Juhu to Kurla where he was staying with a friend. ""Twenty minutes into the ride, the driver, Rohit Singh, said that he needed to withdraw money. He reappeared within a few minutes with two police officers. I figured later that he had parked outside Santacruz police station,"" Sarkar told TOI on Thursday evening.

Sarkar, who had arrived in Mumbai on February 3 for a poetry reading session at the Kala Ghoda Festival, had also taken time out to participate in the ongoing protests at Mumbai Bagh, an anti-CAA gathering near Mumbai Central, inspired by Delhi's Shaheen Bagh. ""I had been a part of the protests in Jaipur and wanted to do the same in Mumbai, but the taxi driver's reaction had nothing to do with that,"" said Sarkar, recounting his conversation on the phone with a friend in Jaipur during his cab ride that led to the fracas.

(Representative image)

KOLKATA: City-based Emami Group has sold its cement business under Emami Cement to Nirma Group firm Nuvoco Vistas Corporation ( NVC ) in order cut group-level debt and pledged shares. More than 71% of promoters’ holding in Emami, the flagship of the diversified conglomerate, is now being pledged as per the latest filing in stock exchanges. Emami Group has said that it has divested 100% equity stake in Emami Cement for an enterprise value of Rs 5,500 crore.

Top officials of the group said that Rs 3,000 crore will be utilised to make Emami Cement debt-free and the remaining Rs 2,500 crore will be used to pare group-level debt and share pledge. Following this, the total debt will go down to Rs 600 crore from Rs 3,100 crore.

Emami Group promoters have divested 10% each in two tranches in the last one year to reduce debt. In the first tranche, promoters’ holding was reduced to a little over 62% from 72% in flagship Emami for Rs 1,600 crore to reduce debt at the owners’ level in early 2019. Later on, it was further reduced to 52.7%. At the current prices, the value of promoters’ stake in Emami would be around Rs 7,000 crore.

Emami scrip in the stock exchanges on Thursday dipped 1.3% to Rs 302.9 on Thursday. Emami Cement operates one integrated cement plant and three grinding units with a total cement grinding capacity of around 8.3 million tonne per annum. The company has a turnover of Rs 2,500 crore and is in a cash-positive zone. The acquisition will bring its total cement capacity of Nuvoco in eastern, northern and western India to 23.5 million tonne (which includes the ongoing capacity expansion project in its Jojobera plant) and over 60 ready-mix plants.

Hiren Patel, chairman, Nuvoco, said: “This acquisition is a momentous and transformational step in Nuvoco’s journey to becoming a major building materials company in India.”

Aditya Agarwal, director, Emami Group, said: “We are very proud of Emami Cement, which has achieved significant milestones in a very short span of time. It has successfully established a very strong brand equity in the market for its highest standard of operation and high-quality products, helping us get a good value. The Nuvoco and Nirma Group will continue from here and strengthen the business further.”

Commenting on the deal, Manish Goenka, director, Emami Group, added that this transaction is an important step in the Group’s stated objective of becoming debt-free. “With this transaction, we will substantially achieve this objective,” he said.

Shardul Amarchand Mangaldas acted as the legal advisor for the deal while Deloitte Touche Tohamatsu India LLP was the financial diligence advisor and Arpwood Capital the financial advisor.

Nagpur: In a first for the city, an in-depth scientific study to assess the health effects of vehicular noise pollution is being carried out at ten locations.

After conducting noise mapping in 27 cities of the state, the National Environmental Engineering Research Institute (Neeri) and the Maharashtra Pollution Control Board (MPCB) have initiated the study to monitor and assess noise pollution with respect to number of vehicles, frequency of honking and speed.

The locations are Itwari, Dharampeth, Sitabuldi, Indora Square, Trimurti Nagar, Hasanbagh Road, Wardha Road, Rameshwari Road, Vitthal Nagar (near Manewada) and Dattatrey Nagar.

According to the scientists, the ten locations were selected based on the findings of noise mapping. “In Nagpur, we had monitored decibel levels at around 55 locations out of which, these ten turned out to be the noisiest,” said Ritesh Vijay, principal scientist and head of Mumbai zonal centre, adding that the study kick-started in the first week of January.

The locations include commercial areas, residential areas and major and minor roads. At each location, the monitoring is being done for 48 hours — 24 working hours and 24 non-working hours (Saturday and Sunday). “For one location, we are recording 1.72 lakh readings,” said Vijay.

Highlighting the aim of the research, the scientist stated that the focus will be on quantifying the level of decibels with vehicular traffic. “After we completed the noise mapping, the Bombay bench of high court further directed to conduct a more in-depth study to know the impact of traffic noise on human health. In this study, we are specifically quantifying the pollution in terms of noise emitted from honking and different vehicles with different speed,” said Vijay.

A similar study was carried out in Mumbai at 15 locations. The decibel levels have been recorded and are being analysed now.

In March 2017, TOI had reported about noise mapping study which was conducted in Nagpur, Amravati, Akola and Chandrapur. While hearing a public interest litigation on breach of noise pollution norms, the Bombay high court had asked the state government to file a detailed reply following which the agencies had proposed the idea of statewide noise mapping.

Recently, Neeri completed the country’s first noise pollution monitoring using bicycles. Launched in 10 cities of the state, the study focused on “real-time mapping”. Nagpur’s monitoring revealed that noise pollution levels were breaching the permissible decibel marks all across the city.

The petitioners have opposed use of school ground in Chimur town of Chandrapur district for holding popular ‘Ghoda Yatra Utsav 2020’ and ‘Meena Bazaar’ from January 30 to February 21. The area belongs to Nehru Vidyalaya and Junior College run by Chimur Education Society.

Even as the petitioners have moved court, the yatra has begun there.

According to petitioners Nilam Rachalwar, Dharamsingh Varma, Yogesh Thune, Amol Junghare and Amit Dhobale, the playground cannot be used for commercial or religious purposes, but the school authorities have rented it out for the festival for Rs 12.50 lakh, that too during the peak exam period.

The petitioners also contended that the event would be lasting for 23 days and after that it would take a couple of days to clean the ground. Moreover, preparations for organizing the event had started about a month back, thus deprived students of sporting activities for over a month.

The judges, while orally questioning the petitioners’ motive behind filing the plea, asked them to shell out the amount if they want the court to hear their case. They further asked all five petitioners, who were present during the hearing, whether they were representing parents/students, as no complaint came from their side. Though the petitioners expressed inability to deposit the amount, the court asked them to complete the formalities before next hearing.

466,['7/02/2020'],Standing panel nod to Rs 68 crore works,"This story is from February 7, 2020

Nagpur: The Nagpur Municipal Corporation’s (NMC) poor fiscal health notwithstanding, the standing committee led by chairman Pradip Pohane on Thursday approved issuance of work orders and administrative approval to projects worth Rs61.36 crore and Rs7.05 crore.

Many corporators, including standing committee members, complained about civic administration not issuing work orders to contractors citing fund crunch.

Pohane too admitted that many corporators have been approaching him since January stating that work orders issued by the standing panel were not being executed by the civic administration.

Congress corporator and standing committee member Harshala Sable said that despite the panel’s nod, the civic administration is yet to issue work order for many important works in her prabhag.

Pohane said the proposals being given approval by the standing committee were already mentioned in his budget for 2019-2020. So far, no proposal outside his budget has been given approval, he said.

On Thursday, the panel gave its nod to the project department’s proposal to a housing scheme for economically weaker section (EWS) near Jaitala Square on Orange City Street.

With the standing panel’s nod, the department will now entrust the work to construct eight buildings comprising ground-plus six floors in each apartment at a cost of Rs56.57 crore to a private firm.

Pohane claimed that the work orders of proposals of various development works given nod by his committee will be executed by the NMC. He said though the NMC’s financial condition is not better, it will improve this month with the recovery of property tax.

Sources said new municipal commissioner Tukaram Mundhe took objection over budgetary provision of Rs50 lakh for Baisakh festival to be celebrated in next financial year. TOI had highlighted that despite reeling under financial crisis, the NMC was wasting taxpayers’ money on needless events.

Pravin Togadia interacts with journalists in Nagpur

NAGPUR: Pravin Togadia , former president of Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) and now a vocal critic of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, has raised the cause of wild animal menace in agricultural land as he also called for a law to promote birth control in the country.

“One of the biggest problems dogging the country’s farmers is infestation of the fields by wild animals like deer, boar and neelgai (blue bull), to even lions in my home state of Gujarat. I have come up with a mechanism of scaring away the animals with low voltage AC current, in wires charged with solar power,” he said during his visit to Nagpur.

“Called Jhatka, I have been propagating method in different states of the country. Lately, I met Madhya Pradesh chief minister Kamal Nath over the issue,” said Togadia who was once the Hindutva poster boy of Sangh Parivar and has now distanced himself from the organization.

The animal need not step over the wire and the shock can be felt even by passing over it.

“I also plan to initiate a drive pressing for a law that will deny government benefits to a couple having more than two children,” he told TOI.

Togadia expressed his disappointment over the selections of members for the Ram Mandir trust. Except Vasudevanand Saraswati, only the loyalists of PM Narendra Modi have been included in the trust, instead of those who actually took part in the Ram Jamanbhoomi movement,” he said.

He said the economy is getting worse and the Modi government has failed to address the issue. The banks are ridden with NPAs and twice the government has dipped into the reserves.

The suitcase with Umesh Patil’s body was dumped near the tracks

THANE: Thane police anti-extortion cell arrested a 27-year-old man for allegedly strangling a 56-year-old man, putting his body in a suitcase and dumping it near railway tracks, in Dombivli. The case was cracked nine hours after the body was found in Bavanchal.

The accused, Praful Pawar, is a tourist car operator from Dombivli, said senior inspector (anti-extortion cell) Rajkumar Kothmire, adding that the victim, Umesh Patil, was a Kopri resident who was an assistant accountant with the debt redressal tribunal office, Navi Mumbai.

The officer said Pawar got acquainted with Patil six months back. “The victim used to visit the house of the accused, who was not married, and both were believed to be in an intimate relationship,” Kothmire said. The accused married few months back and things soured between the duo, as the accused started “avoiding” him. Upset over that, Patil visited Pawar’s house in Dombivli, when his wife had gone to office.

“Both fought over the issue and the accused, in a fit of rage, strangled the victim, after he threatened to reveal their relationship to his wife. He packed his body in a suitcase and dumped it in bushes near the tracks. It was found on Thursday morning by passers-by,” police said.

A team led by Kothmire started a probe and on carrying out an “in-depth technical analysis” zeroed in on the accused, who was arrested at 6pm on Thursday. Police said that in 2013 a case of attempt to murder had been registered against Pawar with Vishnu Nagar police station, details of which are being gathered.

In the last few months, many killings have been reported in Mumbai and Thane district, where bodies have been dumped in suitcases. On December 4, 2019, the body of guitarist Bennett Rebello (59) was found stuffed in suitcases.

KC Narayanagowda with wife and daughter after he took oath

BENGALURU/HUBBALLI: Kalyana Karnataka and coastal Karnataka, the BJP’s stronghold in recent times, and the old Mysuru region have virtually gone unrepresented in chief minister BS Yediyurappa’s cabinet, despite threats and protests from a handful of legislators.

From Kalaburagi to Dakshina Kannada and from Davangere to Mysuru, 12 of the state’s 30 districts are not represented in the cabinet even after Thursday, when 10 new ministers joined the 17, who took oath in August. In a first, Bengaluru has the lion’s share with seven ministers out of 28 (including the CM).

Ahead of the expansion, more than 10 MLAs under Shorpur’s Narasimha Nayak (Raju Gouda) had exerted pressure on Yediyurappa to ensure fair representation to the backward districts of Kalyana Karantaka. But only Anand Singh (Vijayanagar constituency of Ballari district) was given a berth.

Amarnath Patil, president, Hyderabad Karnataka Chamber of Commerce and Industry, said the Dr Nanjundappa committee report had recommended at least eight MLAs from the region should be made ministers for it to develop. But the government has only two — Singh and Prabhu Chauhan from Bidar.

“In the absence of fair representation, most of our problems will remain unsolved. With only two representatives, it is not going to help overall growth of the region,” said Patil, while ruing the fact that the region — comprising six districts — lacks a strong voice.

A supporter of Gouda said Kalyana Karnataka has got a raw deal and urged the CM to consider at least three more MLAs during the next round of expansion. Failing this, he said, the BJP could suffer in future elections.

It’s not Kalyana Karnataka alone. The coastal districts of Udupi and Dakshina Kannada have no MLAs in the cabinet. Barring Muzrai minister Kota Srinivas Poojari from Udupi, who is a member of the legislative council, the two districts voted in as many as 11 BJP candidates of a total 12 constituencies.

“Fairness in district representation should be automatically considered by our senior leadership,” said S Angara, seven-time Sullia MLA. “While we representatives of Karavalli [coastal] districts understand political compulsions, we hope the leadership considers the need for fair district representation.”

As for old Mysuru, the BJP lacks MLAs from the region. However, Yediyurappa was expected to swear in at least one of three senior MLAs — SA Ramdas (Mysuru) and KG Bopaiah and Appachu Ranjan (Kodagu). The three had lobbied hard for a ministerial berth but to no avail.

Train speed is expected to increase to 160kmph from the current 130kmph

MUMBAI: With major upgradation plans to increase train speeds, travel time between Mumbai and New Delhi is likely to come down to 12 hours, saving commuters over three hours. The Indian Railways has drawn up a plan to boost infrastructure, which includes providing fencing and strengthening bridges along the entire 1,384-km corridor so the trains can run at160 kmph, instead of the current 130 kmph.

The upgradation work is pegged at Rs 11,188 crore, including Rs 4,011 crore on Western Railway.

Western Railway’s chief public relations officer Ravinder Bhakar said, “Currently, the travel time between New Delhi and Mumbai Central is 15 hours and 30 minutes . Once the upgradation work is completed in three years, the travel will come down to 12 hours as speed will increase and bottlenecks will be removed.”

To achieve this, the Railways will have to undertake upgradation of tracks, bridges, signalling and over head equipment installations, besides removal of some permanent speed restrictions (PSR). The Mumbai-New Delhi passes through seven statesand four zonal railways – Northern Railway, North Central Railway, West Central Railway and Western Railway. Of the 1,384-km route, around 694 km is through WR territory, between Mumbai Central and Nagda.

Bhakar said, “The estimates will be sent for approval and tenders will soon be invited and contractors approved as work has to be completed by December 2023.” Fencing (RCC walls or wire fencing) will have to be provided throughout the route to prevent trespassing and cattle from being run over. The cost of boundary wall/fencing in WR’s jurisdiction from Mumbai Central to Nagda alone is Rs600 crore.

All 186 manned level crossing gates will have to be eliminated and ROBs or subways built to ensure a speed of 160 kmph. Also, permanent speed restrictions will have to removed so that trains can achieve the desired speed. Besides, bridges on the route will have to be strengthened.

The cost of rehabilitation of bridges will cost around Rs550 crore in the Western Railway jurisdiction up to Nagda. New OHE mast as well more substations and improvement in signalling system will also have to be undertaken.

TimesView We laud sporting achievements, rewards for excellence, space programmes, stock-market performance and corporate results, but what we should also be celebrating is humanity — those little acts of kindness that may not mean much to the doer, but are of great significance to the recipients. The gesture of the five restaurateurs shows how things can be turned around in public schools if the community joins forces with stakeholders: The school management that thought of special classes to improve results, the citizen-activist who noticed hungry children and the restaurants that heeded her call to respond to the problem.

More than willing to help kids study, say hoteliers

BENGALURU: When the bell rings at 3.30pm at Government Boys' High School, 18th Cross, Malleswaram , Class 10 students rush out of their classrooms. Before the next two-hour session begins, they sit in the school corridor and dig into snacks sponsored by eateries from the area to help them remain focused on studies.For a week now, some 35 students find preparatory classes for SSLC exams no sweat, thanks to the free snacks arranged by five restaurants. The menu changes every day: Vada Pav, noodles, pulao and idli.With the SSLC exams beginning on March 27, the school started special classes, after school hours, in the third week of January to improve its results from 46% last year. The school starts at 8.30am, midday meals are provided around 12.30pm and free snacks at 3.30pm.Anupama Harish, from Sadashivanagar who works closely with the school and runs a Facebook page on Malleswaram, noticed that the children preparing for SSLC exams were going hungry. ""I wondered why not ask nearby restaurants to get them snacks. When I approached them, five happily agreed,"" she said.Shuchi Ruchi, Mumbai Bistro Resto Cafe and Iyengar Bakery in Malleswaram, Chung Wah in Vyalikaval and Udupi Sri Krishna Bhavan in Balepet are taking turns from Monday to Friday to supply snacks to the students. The special classes are on till March 25.“We thank the restaurants for their gesture,” said GP Latha, who heads the school.Ismail Shuchi Ruchi, proprietor of Shuchi Ruchi, said he was 16 and penniless when he came from Bantwal to Bengaluru. “I’ve established myself as a hotelier in the past three decades. I can relate to the plight of government school students. I could not study beyond SSLC. I was happy when Anupama approached me. It’s an opportunity to do my bit,” Ismail said.Rashmi Holla, who heads Udupi Sri Krishna Bhavan, said many people are ready to bail out the needy, but one must seek help. Dengra Govind of Chung Wah said, “If it helps better students’ results, there’s no better takeaway.”Hitesh Kumar of Mumbai Bistro said everything should be done to motivate the children. Ramesh Iyengar of Iyengar Bakery said he was more than willing to offer help: “Why not assist children when they are studying hard?”",bengaluru,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73996447,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-599233,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/bengaluru-free-snacks-from-five-hotels-keep-students-focused-in-special-classes/articleshow/73996365.cms

478,['7/02/2020'],Ortho-mattresses for Bengal MLAs,"This story is from February 7, 2020

Kolkata: If the long Budget assembly session that begins on Friday threatens to give MLAs sleepless nights, here’s something that promises to provide them better shut-eye after a day’s work, while taking excellent care of their spines. After several MLAs staying at the MLA hostel on Kyd Street complained of backache and arthritic problems, the Bengal legislative body has decided to replace all old mattresses there with high-quality ‘orthopaedic mattresses’.

Assembly sources said the decision to purchase mattresses was taken after MLAs — mostly from the districts, who stay at the hostel when the House is in session — complained of poor living facilities. “Speaker Biman Banerjee directed the House Committee, headed by Tapas Banerjee, the Trinamool Congress MLA from South Asansol, to submit a report regarding improving infrastructure at the hostel,” said a senior official. “One of the recommendations was to purchase these ‘ortho-mattresses’, as many of the MLAs were found suffering from backache and spondylosis. The speaker then asked for a tender so that the mattresses could be bought.”

An orthopaedic mattress is one that’s designed to support the joints, back and overall body, created to combat problems one might experience with a bad back or joints by providing a firm surface that offers targeted support. But since there is no government standard or official designation that qualifies one mattress to be orthopaedic, the modern use of the term “orthopaedic” is largely a marketing term.

“The mattresses we are replacing had been purchased at least 20 years ago, and all of them were in a very bad condition. So, the new mattresses had to be purchased,” said Tapas. “As most MLAs are elderly and have orthopaedic problems, the committee recommended ortho-mattresses. The MLAs have to sit the whole day — not less than six to seven hours at a stretch — and they need comfortable sleep.”

A total of 200 mattresses have been bought for each bed at the hostel. Nearly 60% of these 200 MLAs who regularly use the hostel are aged 60 and above.

New TV sets and curtains have also been installed. At the House itself, special massage chairs have been installed on the first floor.

I can’t believe I’m getting married in two months,” exclaims actor Nikhil Siddhartha , as we finally manage to get hold of him. The past few days have been a whirlwind for the actor — he went down on one knee and popped the question to the love of his life, Dr Pallavi Varma , at a romantic seaside locale in Goa. She said yes, of course. And then, the two got engaged formally in a private ceremony here in Hyderabad on Saturday. But how did the party boy of Tollywood decide to get ‘domesticated’ so easily, we can’t help but wonder aloud. “Trust me, I wasn’t even thinking of settling down anytime soon,” he says, laughing. “But then, six months ago, Pallavi walked into my life and everything changed!”From meeting to mangni and shaadi, all in six months? “Guess what, it took me exactly 10 seconds to fall in love with her.

Had it been anybody else, I would’ve laughed at the idea of marriage, but with Pallavi, I immediately felt certain that I wanted to spend the rest of my life with her,” he adds.Although it was love at first sight for Nikhil, winning over his lady love was, confessedly, easier said than done. “I had to run after her, woo her and win her heart.

I was confident that she liked me, so I decided to take her to Goa and surprise her by popping the big question. She has friends from all over the country, so I called all of them there and then went down on one knee and asked her to marry me. Yes, it was super filmy but she loved the surprise and said ‘yes’,” the actor shares, adding, “It wasn’t my plan to get engaged, but at the spur of the moment, I decided to pull off this proposal and after she accepted, we exchanged rings in a private ceremony in Hyderabad, where only our families and close friends were present. It was beautiful.”Dr Pallavi, who hails from Bhimavaram in Andhra Pradesh, is an MBBS graduate from MVJ Medical College in Bengaluru and is currently preparing to do her post-graduation in Hyderabad. “As an actor, I work long hours and at odd timings. On some days, I have to work for over 16 hours. Being a doctor, Pallavi gets that, because she too is a workaholic. It feels comforting to know that my life partner will be someone who understands me. She also stayed with me through thick and thin — first, when Arjun Suravaram faced issues and got delayed, and later when it became a success.

New Delhi: Trinamool Congress will oppose the proposed disinvestment of LIC in Parliament, and take to the streets if necessary, against the Narendra Modi government’s bid to sell out “jewels” of the country.

TMC MP from Diamond Harbour Abhishek Banerjee took on the government during the Budget debate and appealed to the opposition and BJP members to stand up and save LIC from privatisation if they are true “desh bhakts”. Addressing the treasury benches, he said: “You talk about desh bhakti and patriotism. If you have a spine, save LIC from privatisation. The jewels of the country are on sale. We will oppose it. Yeh hamara desh bhakti hai. Hamara koi farzi desh bhakti nehi hai (This is our patriotism. We do not subscribe to any fake patriotism).”

Abhishek, also Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee’s nephew, told the Lok Sabha the Centre is out to disinvest an organisation that enjoys the trust of 70% insurance policy-holders in the country. “Like 37% of people who voted for the current ruling party, LIC also placed its trust in you. There have been occasions when this organisation bailed you out. It funds most government projects. And you are dragging it to the market. Sadly, LIC authorities didn’t foresee this and carve out a policy to save its own life,” he said.

Abhishek added that the government can’t disinvest LIC without passing an amendment act. “It seems the government has to bring an amendment before implementing the LIC disinvestment decision,” he said.

He expressed concern over the condition of Food Corporation of India. “The government has slashed food subsidy by Rs 70,000 crore. If this is one side of the picture, the other side is that unpaid bills by the Centre to FCI add up to Rs 2 lakh crore. This will bring a severe fund crunch for which FCI will have to borrow to sustain itself. I fear FCI is going to be next,” he added.

Kolkata: Trinamool Congress on Thursday termed as “unfortunate” governor Jagdeep Dhankhar ’s comments in Santiniketan, where he said it “pained” him that Bengal’s farmers did not get their dues.

The governor paid tribute to Rabindranath Tagore for his “unalloyed affection towards farmers” and then pitched for a central government scheme: “The Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi is a revolutionary scheme for farmers.” He then said it “pained” him that Bengal’s farmers did not get this money. “There should be no politics when it comes to development,” he added.

Trinamool minister Ashis Banerjee responded: “It is very unfortunate that the governor has made a remark without getting full information. CM Mamata Banerjee has done enough for farmers’ welfare.”

Dhankhar reached Santiniketan for Magh Mela by the state government-provided helicopter on Thursday but made it clear that the granting of the chopper service should not be seen as a means to broker peace between the governor and the government. “It is up to the state government whether it will provide the service or not. I would have left Kolkata for Santiniketan at 4am, not 8 am, if I was not given helicopter,” he said.

485,['7/02/2020'],"Jagdeep Dhankhar: Govt, governor in war of nerves over Budget speech","This story is from February 7, 2020

Santiniketan/Kolkata: The war of nerves between the Bengal government and governor Jagdeep Dhankhar continued a day before the assembly Budget session on Friday, with the government insisting it would not amend the speech it had prepared for him (to be read out to the session) and Dhankhar responding that “a new history” would be written in the assembly.

Dhankhar received the draft of the governor’s speech from the state government on Sunday. He responded by sending his suggestions to the government, hoping that they would be incorporated in the speech and making it imperative for the chief minister to call an urgent state cabinet meeting and consider the “suggestions” before accepting or rejecting them.

But the state government told Raj Bhavan on Thursday evening that the text of the governor’s address it had already sent stood as “final”.

Dhankhar said on Friday that he would go by the Constitution and would not cross the “Lakshman Rekha”. “The government is within it rights to put in the governor’s address all it wants. It can put its policies, ideas, achievements in the speech as decided in the cabinet meeting. I too, as the Constitutional head, can give my suggestions. The government has acted in its right to prepare the governor’s address. I have acted in my right to give suggestions. I hope that the government may consider my suggestions,” he said in Santiniketan on Thursday morning.

He, however, did not elaborate on his Constitutional position. “This is the first time a governor born in independent India will address the inaugural session of the assembly. I can assure you that I will act cent per cent according to the Constitution,” Dhankhar said.

The state government prepares a speech for the governor to read out before the Assembly’s Budget session and, by convention, the governor reads out this prepared speech. Governors may, however, take recourse to Article 159 of the Constitution (the oath-taking clause) that mandates them to “protect the Constitution and devote himself/herself to the service and well-being of the people”, Constitution experts say, which “leaves a lot that may be open to interpretation”.

Trinamool minister Chandrima Bhattacharya said she had never heard of such an impasse. “This is the budget session. The state finance minister will place the budget. Have you ever heard of the president of India or any state governor making suggestions? I fail to understand what he is saying,” she said.

Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee is scheduled to reach the assembly at 11 a.m. on Friday and will attend the business advisory committee meeting and is likely to hold a meeting with Trinamool MLAs ahead of the Budget session.

The who and what of canine blood donation

Busting a myth







It was a chilly winter evening in November when Rimjhim Joshi’s Rottweiler, Ruby, donated a unit of blood for a sick puppy who needed urgent blood transfusion. ""That was the first time that I ever heard of a dog donating blood. I was anxious initially but the vet guided us through the process and I am happy Ruby could save another pup's life,"" says Rimjhim.Like Rimjhim, many of us are unaware of this process, but cities like Chennai, Hyderabad and Delhi NCR have dedicated animal blood banks for those in need! Even Indore is opening up to the idea through queries on social media network, online apps and more, giving pets and pet parents a chance to save lives of fellow canines.“Much like humans, animals also suffer from life-threatening diseases and accidents where they need immediate blood transfusion. Most commonly, dogs get affected by the Parvo virus which leads to a lot of blood loss,"" says Dr Sandeep Nanavati, a city-based vet, adding, ""When pet donors come forward to donate even one unit of blood for such ailing animals, we are able to save lives.”He maintains that whenever such a requirement comes in, they start floating messages via texts through animal rescue and activist networks in the city. “There is need, but awareness of the process is missing. In such a case, when animal activists guide the pet parents about it, they come forward for donation,"" he says.And this is not restricted to pets alone. Even strays stand to benefit from the donation. Reshma Motwani, an animal communicator who also works in rescue and rehabilitation of dogs, shares, “Sometimes we need blood donors for accident cases involving strays. I recently shifted from Pune and there, it's a common practice. So, when pet clinics get in touch with a requirement, I contact pet parents of healthy dogs that can donate blood.""While a Hyderabad-based professional Shiva Kumar launched a national blood donation directory for animals last year in June, Indore is catching up and creating an online group of donors that pet parents or doctors can peruse in times of need. “We are setting up an online directory for the city's animal lovers as well as veterinaries which can be accessed immediately in time of need,"" adds Rimjhim.Since dogs have over 12 blood groups, vets recommend a blood test and identification of their pets’ group. “For the first donation, blood groups needn’t be matched as dogs, unlike humans, do not have naturally occurring antibodies that oppose blood types in their bodies before transfusion. But it is better for pet parents to have complete knowledge of their pets’ blood type in case there is a need or they want to donate for the same blood type,” shares another vet Dr Narendra Chouhan, who conducted the blood donation for Ruby the Rottweiler.- It takes approximately 30 minutes to get one unit of blood – 450 ml- A dog can donate once in three months- Any dog that weighs 25 kgs or more can donate- The donor should not be on any medication“Many pet parents think the process may be painful and detrimental for the pets’ health. But just like humans, the dog does not feel drained out or weak after the donation. No normal activities of the animal are hampered by donating one unit,” explains Dr Chouhan.As of now there are only 7-10 pet donors in the city who are aware and ready for donation. But there are more number of canines that need transfusions every month. A canine blood donation camp is the need of the hour right now. It will also help in busting myths and doubts about the process.– Kushagra Rathore, HR professional and animal loverSince Indore lacks a proper animal blood bank and only a few pet clinics provide such a facility, more serious cases are referred to the Veterinary College and Hospital in Mhow. But chances are, a pet may not have that much time to make it to the place.

It’s an indication of the palpable fears over NRC and CAA among a large section of the population, despite Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee’s repeated assurances that the exercise would not be held in Bengal.Ahmed has also asked the department’s officials at the borough offices to cater to the additional demand for birth certificates.A civic staffer who sits at one of the birth certificate counters at the KMC headquarters said the number of applicants for birth certificates was going up by leaps and bounds, and the corporation didn’t have the manpower or training to handle the sudden rush.“In September last year, we noticed a sharp increase in the number of applicants. And the number is growing every day,” said a KMC health department official. “While the staffers at three counters can at best issue 100 certificates after clearing all requisite parameters, the target has now doubled. Even then, we will be forced to reject many applicants as these days as many as 400 applicants are turning up per day.”According to the department’s officials, it is not only youths who have been turning up for proof of their birth. “We are noticing that people born in the 60s and 70s are also visiting in large numbers,” said an official.TOI visited the KMC birth certificate counters on Thursday and saw a heavy rush. Businessman Bashir Ahmed, a resident of Picnic Garden who was seen standing impatiently, said it was his third visit to the civic headquarters in a fortnight. Explaining his urgency for repeatedly visiting the civic headquarters, Ahmed said he needed the certificate as a “credible document” that could be produced before any competent authority if his citizenship was challenged.Tanmoy Bose, a private firm employee and a resident of Vidyasagar Colony, close to the Baghajatin Market, was seen happily emerging from a counter, a couple of birth certificates in hand. Bose said he was fortunate that all documents submitted by him matched the records of KMC’s health department.",kolkata,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73996700,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-754139,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/nrc-scare-fuels-rush-for-birth-cert-at-kmc-hq/articleshow/73995111.cms

John Chen, a college graduate, is desperately seeking help for his mom. She has a high fever, but isn’t strong enough to stand in line for hours to be tested for the virus raging through their city. On the front line, a 30-year-old respiratory doctor has slept only a few hours in two weeks.Scenes of chaos and despair are emerging daily from China’s Hubei province, the landlocked region of 60 million people where the new coronavirus was first identified. While cases have spread around the globe, the virus’ impact has been most keenly felt in Hubei, which has seen a staggering 97% of all deaths from the illness, and 67% of all patients.“If the province was not sealed off, some people would have gone all around the country to try to get medical help, and would have turned the whole nation into an epidemic-stricken area,” said Yang Gonghuan, former deputy director general of China’s Center for Disease Control and Prevention. “Some things are hard, but must be done.”As the lockdown continues with no end in sight, it’s raising ethical questions. “The lockdown may be necessary to contain the spread, but you have to ensure there’s enough medical resources to meet the demand for care in those cities,” said Zhang Qianfan of Peking University.Over 8,000 medical workers have gone into Hubei, but hospitals are still short of supplies. For those seeking medical care, resignation has set in. The idea of sacrificing one’s self for a greater, national goal is deeply-embedded in Chinese culture. “You learn that’s how the system works,” Chen said.",world,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73996435,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-135693,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/china/china-sacrifices-a-province-to-save-world/articleshow/73996446.cms

GURUGRAM: A personal security officer (PSO) who had in 2018 gunned down the wife and son of the additional sessions judge to whom he had been assigned was on Thursday held guilty by the district court. The quantum of punishment will be pronounced in the next few days.Mahipal, who had on the afternoon of October 13, 2018 shot at the duo on the road in front of the busy Arcadia market in South City 2 — an attack captured on mobile phones of onlookers — was convicted under IPC sections 302 (murder) and 201 (destruction of evidence) and Section 27 of the Arms Act.The PSO had driven additional sessions judge (ASJ) Krishan Kant’s wife Ritu (42) and son Dhruv (17) to Arcadia market. After an altercation over handing over car keys, Mahipal had shot at Ritu twice, in the chest and stomach, and at Dhruv thrice, once on the shoulder and twice in the head, with his service revolver. He then tried to put Dhruv’s body in the car but after two failed attempts, abandoned the boy and drove off. Ritu succumbed to her injuries the same day while Dhruv died after 10 days at a private hospital. Judge Krishan Kant is currently posted in Ambala.The case was heard by additional sessions judge Sudhir Parmar. As part of evidence, police and prosecution presented CCTV footage from the crime spot, Ritu’s dying declaration, Mahipal’s phone calls to judge Krishan Kant in which he confessed, and forensic reports. Around 64 witnesses recorded their statements in the case. One of them was a judge from Bihar who had recorded a video showing the 38-year-old PSO dragging Dhruv’s body and later leaving the crime scene.An SIT formed by Gurugram police had submitted its chargesheet before the court on December 26, 2018. In its final report, police listed a total of 81 witnesses, including doctors from Paras Hospital, where the injured were initially taken, as well as Medanta Hospital, forensic experts and police personnel associated with the probe. In January 9, 2019, charges were framed and trial began on February 1.Public prosecutor Anurag Hooda said that there was enough evidence to make it a very strong case. He said the ballistics report confirmed Mahipal had used the gun as bullet residue was found on his hand and the car’s steering wheel. The bloodstains on his clothes also matched with those of the deceased, he said, adding that the call details corroborated that after the shooting, Mahipal had called Kant and another PSO, Vinay, who was also posted with the judge, confessing to his crime.Mahipal had claimed it was accidental firing and he had no intention to kill.Advocate Vishal Gupta, who represented judge Krishan Kant, welcomed the verdict. “The case is unique. Never before was a member of the judiciary subjected to this kind of violence, that too by his own protector. The protector became the predator,” Gupta said, adding that keeping in view the “magnitude of the terrifying act” and its “brutality”, they will seek the death penalty.",gurgaon,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73996519,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-169684,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/pso-who-killed-judges-family-in-2018-shooting-convicted/articleshow/73993630.cms

Nagpur: Cinema establishes an emotional connect with the viewers. For those who appreciate movies solely for their content, language doesn’t matter. The Orange City International Film Festival , which was inaugurated on Thursday, will be offering a bouquet of multiple language films for such movie fans.

The inauguration function of the fourth edition of the film festival, held at Vanamati Auditorium, was attended by well-known filmmakers like Madhur Bhandarkar and Jabbar Patel and animation guru Ashish Kulkarni.

The four-day festival has been organized by the Orange City Cultural Foundation and Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) in association with Saptak, Pune Film Festival and Vidarbha Sahitya Sangh. Over 30 full-length Indian and foreign feature films will be screened at Inox, Jaswant Tuli Mall.

Bhandarkar was recipient of this year’s OCIFF award for ‘Outstanding contribution to Indian Cinema’. In his speech, the filmmaker spoke about his love for cinema and the changing perspective in the industry. “It feels amazing to receive such an appreciation. Films are the mirror of our society and are remembered for years to come. The film industry is going through major changes and our cinema now has wider and better reach. I am grateful for receiving the award in the presence of lovely audience of Nagpur,” he said.

Kulkarni, who received the Orange City Cultural Foundation award, shed light on the world of animation. “Animation has become a kids genre. It took 70 years for America to bring animation to family entertainment genre. As an industry we are trying to bring more entertainment with better visuals and audio effects.”

Chandrashekhar Meshram, chairman of Orange City Cultural Foundation, said the film festival is a great opportunity to enjoy good cinema and indulge in visual treats.

Expressing his love for cinema, mayor Sandip Joshi said the NMC always supports such creative events. “I hope the citizens will enjoy the film festival and witness some of the finest works of filmmakers,” he said.

Adding to this, Jabbar Patel, theatre and film director said, “Medium of cinema can be used as an extension of theatre technique to convey a perspective. Each cinema carries a sense of information and emotions. Festivals like this must be conducted to celebrate the same for years to come.”

The ceremony was followed by screening of 2019 release ‘Liza’s Tale/Istorializy’ (Ukraine, Russia), a film directed by Alexander Zhovna. The film focuses on two people suffering from Down syndrome, and their journey about finding happiness while facing hardships of the real world.

Nagpur: The US Consul General at Mumbai David J Rank, visited Rashtirya Swayamsevak Sangh’s (RSS) Smruti Mandir campus at Reshimbagh, and paid homage to RSS founder Dr Keshav Baliram Hedgewar at his memorial.

He was briefed about RSS’ concept on cow-based economy and working of the shakhas, said a source. None of the senior leaders like Bhagwat or the Sarkaryavah (general secretary) Bhaiyaji Joshi were present during his visit on Thursday.

Rank is the third diplomat to have visited the RSS office in the past year. In July last year the German Ambassador Walter J Rinder, had visited the RSS headquarters at Mahal and met the Sarsanghchalak (chief) Mohan Bhagwat. Later in November the Japanese Consul General Michio Harada had visited Reshimbagh.

Sources said Rank had come for a courtesy visit as he was in Nagpur as a part of his tours to visit the areas under him. Rank is in-charge of western Indian states which includes Maharashtra.

Nagpur: Students from institutions across the city put their best foot forward in several competitions organized on the second day of ‘The Athena Fest 2020’, the annual cultural and literary event organized by ‘The Athenaeum’ of Hislop College in association with The Times of India.

The day unfurled with ‘LitMasters’, a patent competition of the college in which participants recreated personality of their favourite authors or characters. They presented a 2-minute monologue without revealing the identities.

Students pieced together appealing ensembles to depict personas from literary works in English, Hindi, Marathi and Sanskrit. Dynamic characters like Draupadi, Dushala and Lady Macbeth came to life as the contestants emulated them with conviction. Spectators were quick to guess the portrayal of Hermione Granger, a popular fictional character in JK Rowling’s Harry Potter series, as the participant amazed everyone with her British accent.

Joint secretary of The Athenaeum and coordinator for LitMasters, Vanshika Singh, said, “Many people have the misconception that literature is something confined to books. The aim behind this event is to bring to life the strong characters and authors by presenting their famous works on stage. The participants got an opportunity to step out of the syllabus. This helped them in understanding the elements of character.”

The second event was photography competition that celebrated the allure of ‘Faces’, which was the theme of the contest . Participants were given three hours to capture their perception of the topic and submit three images.

Prerana Agrawal, a contestant, enjoyed setting out on a journey to explore her surroundings in search of the perfect shot. “The topic was unique and allowed me the flexibility to have my own interpretation of it. It was exciting to go on the field to perceive human emotions and moods,” she said.

Students had valuable points and counter arguments to share on ‘The government should restrict students’ right to freedom of speech and expression’ in the debate competition. Every speaker was given three minutes to put forth their lines of reasoning.

The highlight of the day was ‘Dance battleground’ where dancers clashed in four rounds of intense performances. With fillers like rap and beatboxing, the audience was glued to their seats.

Around 15 entrants had to take a pick from two topics, ‘Reimagining India’ and ‘Travel diaries’, for the painting competition. They depicted their creativity on paper with a vivid splash of colours.

ISLAMABAD: Ehsanullah Ehsan , the former Pakistan Taliban spokesman who was responsible for the shooting of Malala Yousafzai in 2012 and carrying out the deadly Peshawar Army school terror attack in 2014, has escaped from prison, according to a audio clip released by him. In the audio clip, which surfaced on social media on Thursday, Ehsan said that he escaped the confinement of Pakistani security agencies on January 11, claiming Pakistani forces failed to keep their promises made to him during his surrender in 2017.

“With the help of God, I succeeded to escape on January 11, 2020 from the confinement of the security forces,” he is heard saying in the clip. It would be a big blow to Pakistan and its campaign to eradicate the remnants of Taliban if the clip is proved to be authentic. Without revealing his current location, Ehsan said that he would make a detail statement about the days of his confinement in the coming days.

Malala, 22, the youngest Nobel Peace prize winner, was shot by a gunman for campaigning for female education in 2012 in Swat Valley.
