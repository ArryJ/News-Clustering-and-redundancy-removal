2,['6/02/2020'],Yashasvi Jaiswal is Indian cricket’s new poster boy,"Yashasvi hails from Uttar Pradesh, where he was born into a family that owned a small hardware store.

It was his interest in cricket that made him move to Mumbai when he was just 10 years old. He lived in a tent and took up odd jobs, including selling Pani Puri, to save up enough money for his cricket training.

He first came under the spotlight in 2015, when he scored a triple century and took 13 wickets in a record-breaking feat in a school tournament.

Following that, he found a place for himself in the Mumbai Ranji Team as well as the India Under-19 Team.

Yashasvi has also bagged a plum contract from the Rajasthan team in IPL, where he was bought for over Rs 2 crore.

On Tuesday, he became not just the highest run-scorer in the Under-19 World Cup, but also the second Indian batsman to score a century against Pakistan in the history of the tournament.

On Tuesday, the Indian Under-19 team beat team Pakistan to enter the finals of the Under-19 World Cup. This win was extra special as the Indian openers led the team to a 10-wicket victory. Yashasvi Jaiswal, who currently plays for Mumbai in Ranji Trophy, won the hearts of cricket lovers by scoring a century. But that’s not all about the young sportsman.

3,['6/02/2020'],Stressed while watching the news? Could be compassion fatigue,"“Guys, keep sharing, keep posting!” “Are you seeing this?”“What the F***”“cannot. even.”“sigh”~ No posts to show ~These lines (above) often float on our social media feeds and most of us inadvertently end up reading them all. The intention behind this, in most cases, is to evoke empathy. But, in reality, many people are falling prey to compassion fatigue. The horrifying world events and the subsequent news updates that follow are making us either numb or too tired to respond. ‘Secondary traumatic stress’ is, thus, a real concern. The term compassion fatigue is associated with burnout often experienced by those are consuming news 24X7. American writer-comedian Hasan Minhaj spoke about it recently on his show, saying, “We are exposed to all the news, all the time, which makes us feel like we have to care about everything, all the time.” This has put the focus back on compassion fatigue...We’re exposed to all the news all the time, which makes us feel like we have to care about everything all the time... But we can’t possibly care about all of them all the time. There’s even a word for it — compassion fatigue. It’s like we have 50 tabs open in our mental browsers. And we’re about to crash — something’s got to change— Hasan Minhaj, comedianFor 2020: Give yourself a break. Just pick a couple of things to not care about for your sanity. I’m not saying shut down your browser. Just close a couple of tabs.... Especially if it helps you double down on the issues that really matter to you54% of Indians use social media for news updates. This includes 49% of 18 to 25-year-olds, 55% of 26 to 33-year-olds and 58% of 34 to 45-year-olds21% of people constantly feel the urge to stay updated, which is one of the major reasons Indians do not log off from social media accounts. This is followed by the fear of missing work-related communication (12%), to stay active on social media all the time (10%) and to stay connected with friends (9%)*Source: A study conducted by a research and consulting firm and a Chinese smartphone companyUsually, news updates on social media are followed by a fair amount of viewpoints. But with no one around to cross-check this information, what people eventually end up believing in might be way different from ground reality, says filmmaker-activist Kavitha Lankesh. “When you have a face-to-face interaction with someone, you will always have a better and holistic understanding of the issues that you wish to discuss online. Having said that, news alerts may still remain disturbing and fatiguing for many,” she explains.Again, there are times when one feels that a worthy cause is not being discussed enough. “So, one needs to keep going, both online or offline. For instance, if Greta Thunberg had not demonstrated every Friday in front of her school, a global movement on climate change awareness would not have taken place,” she says.People who have a huge follower base on social media should be more judicious about what they post on their pages, according to social media influencer Yamini U. “Some influencers avoid posting about or commenting on burning issues, as they fear losing their followers. But when you have an audience that pays attention to what you say, it is important to speak up,” explains Yamini, stressing the need to do a thorough research before posting anything online.One also needs to ensure that they don’t get emotionally strained while trying to prove a point, she adds. “If you are popular on social media, your followers’ expectations and peer pressure can prove stressful at times. So, it’s important to maintain the balance without affecting your own well-being,” she says.People who are in the public eye are expected to be up-to-date with current issues, and also respond to them from time to time. This, however, can be very taxing, says actor Gulshan Devaiah. “One is constantly expected to be vocal about his/her take on issues concerning the world. But actors have other things to do as well. They also have their personal lives to attend to. One should not succumb to such pressure and share posts on social media just to prove a point. I speak up only when I want to lend my voice to a cause that needs steam, or when I have a genuine opinion to share,” he explains.“Choose causes that you want to support and set realistic goals when working towards them. Setting the bar too high will lead to disappointment and guilt when goals are not achieved,” says Vikram Prabhu, mental health expert. Although compassion fatigue has come under the radar now, mostly after people started complaining about stress due to 24x7 news consumption, this has always been an occupational hazard for caregivers. “Doctors, for instance, are constantly involved in caring for people, and despite being trained to deal with the same, their work can take a toll on them,” says Vikram.",life-style,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73961828,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-137757/73961828.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//life-style/spotlight/stressed-while-watching-the-news-could-be-compassion-fatigue/articleshow/73961828.cms

I am still very scared of yoga. It is easy to do a few sets in the gym, but it is tough to hold a pose. It is like being calm in the storm. Strict no-nos: Overdoing cardio and aerated drinks

Actor Nakkhul ’s physical transformation is arguably one of the most heartening glow ups the Tamil film industry has seen. From a size 42 in the 2000s, the actor now rocks a size 32. Ask what fitness means to him, and the actor responds with an answer that is as interesting as his journey. “Working out at the gym is almost meditative for me. I go into a zen mode whenever I begin exercising,” the actor says as we pulled him aside for a chat in the middle of his Sunday afternoon workout.The actor, who believes in inch-loss over weight-loss, explains how his perspective about fitness has changed over the years. “For Kaadhalil Vizhindhen, I had to lose ten kilos. But I lost it in a stupid, brash way. I reduced intake of calories and carbs and focused a lot on cardio, which was not ideal. Metabolism crashes are not good. Back then, we did not have the kind of exposure we have today. Now, everything is detailed on the internet. If I, the laziest person on the planet can do it, anybody can,” the actor says with a laugh. Here’s his routine...While dieting and fasting methods might work for a few, it is important to understand that it might end up causing metabolism crashes and even disorders in rare cases. “I would recommend taking up diets that you can follow for life and not just for three months just to take that nice photo and put it on the ’Gram. Because you would be back to square one soon. It is bad for the system. Priorities are important. People should not set unrealistic goals by looking at the bodies of Instagrammers. Fitness is about a lifestyle and not just six-pack abs,” Nakkhul notes.Nakkhul calls himself a glorious gourmet and his ‘Joey Tribbiani’ tee rests his case. “Back then, my food pattern used to be a big bhel puri of things (laughs). But now, I try to eat a very balanced meal. I prefer vegetarian food, which is deviod of any masala. I am also trying to include simple, fibrous food in my diet. It is all about eating sans calorie — you put in more energy, you burn more energy. A lot of people fail to realise that fitness is about 20 per cent gym and 80 per cent nutrition,” he explains.Many women might diss weight training fearing bulkiness. But weights are the way to go, the actor informs. “Athletes do cardio because it is their profession. But weights build muscle and challenge your body. Women think they become bulky if they workout with weights. But they won’t. Run for 10 minutes on the treadmill and do a weighted squat for 10 minutes. The latter is going to make your heart race, making the calorie-burn more effective. Protein-binging is another trend that people catch on to, which is bad. Everything should be done with moderation,” he says.",entertainment,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73962681,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-1507070/73962681.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/tamil/movies/news/get-fit-with-nakkhul-fitness-is-about-a-lifestyle-and-not-just-six-pack-abs-says-nakkhul/articleshow/73962681.cms

9,['6/02/2020'],Shoot at Site: The making of Thalaivi,"The world inside the set of Thalaivi in Prasad Labs is very different from the one outside. It, in fact, belongs to a different time period — the glorious 80s. The roofs are lit up with chandeliers, there’s a flower-patterned stage in the middle, with installations of peacocks adorning the sides. There are small pools filled with water, and wax flowers are floating on them. At least 100 dancers, clad in pristine white, are sitting on the steps surrounding the stage. There’s a lot of hustle and bustle — director Vijay and cinematographer Vishal Vittal are working out the camera angle, choreographer Gayathri Raghuram and her assistants are planning the next moves, and a few of the crew assistants are cleaning up the stage for the next shot. Amidst this hullabaloo is Kangana Ranaut , seated on a chair, dressed in a rich red-and-green ensemble.Kangana has drowned out all the sound except for the lines of the song, composed by GV Prakash, that she had learnt by heart. It’s a classical song, and is being shot in Tamil and Hindi one after the other. The shot is called for, and Kangana, as J Jayalalithaa, took to the stage. She isn’t hesitant to ask for multiple takes — after all, the idea is to give a perfect shot.And when the team finally took a break to set up the next sequence, we spoke to them about what it takes to make a biopic on one of the most celebrated actresses and politicians...The film is set in different time periods and it allows me to play with lights. The kind of lights I use for the 60s will be different from the ones I’ll use for the 80s. I can get to show the glamour of the film industry and also the rawness of the political scenario. I have also shot some black and white recreations.— Vishal Vittal, cinematographerWe all know Amma was a good classical dancer. Kangana is doing this style for the first time. She first learnt the basics of Bharatanatyam to get the body language right. My parents, who had assisted Thangappan master, have worked with Amma, and now, I’m working on her biopic. So, it’s a special moment for me.— Gayathri Raghuram, choreographerI have worked with artistes of that generation. So, I am aware of the style that was in vogue then. I have taken inspiration from that and also used my creativity.— Pattanam Rasheed, makeup artisteThough I’ve worked with south actresses like Bhanupriya and Gautami in Bollywood, this is my first Tamil film . I’ve worked with Hema Malini also and have done her hair for her dance shows. I’ve got some references for this film, but I create styles out of my imagination. Kangana is an easy artiste to work with.— Maria Sharma, hairdresserTo get the look right, we spent a lot of time watching Jayalalithaa’s footage. There was a great difference between her look as an actress, and when she started her political journey. So, it’s a challenging task.— Neeta Lulla, costume directorWe spent time researching not just the characters in the film, but also the time period. Like, even if someone is using a pen, we’ll have to carefully use the kind of pen that existed in that period.— Ramakrishna Sabbani and Monika Nigotre, art directorsOn the day we were on the Thalaivi set, Kangana had a special visitor — Ashwini Iyer Tiwari, who directed her latest release Panga. “We really didn’t get time to celebrate the response our film was getting. So, Kanagana called me over here,” Ashwini, who was on the set through the evening, told us.

11,['6/02/2020'],I have never won anything in my life before this: Shine Shetty,"Actor-entrepreneur Shine Shetty has returned home a winner after a 114-day stay in the Bigg Boss Kannada house. Getting through to him, though, turned out to be easier said than done. After nearly four months of living without access to technology, including his mobile phone, Shine tells us he’s forgotten the passwords to his gadgets, so much so that he’s relying on his parents to connect with the outside world. Eating home-made goodies, catching up on sleep and replying to messages on social media are on Shine’s mind at the moment. But all that he has been able to do is meet fans who come to congratulate him and cut cakes with them. And it is amid all this that we caught up with the winner. Excerpts...“Winning this season of the show is truly unbelievable. I never imagined that I would get such response. The one thing everyone talks to me about now is how inspiring my journey has been, beginning with serials, turning to F&B with a food truck when the going got tough and my win now. This is the perfect ending to my story,” he states.For Shine, this trophy is extra special for another reason. “I have never won anything in my life and this is the first (and probably the heaviest) trophy I have got. I’m very grateful for all the love and support that I have got so far,” he adds.So, what was his first thought when he got into the house? “I had told myself one thing, which was to be honest and true to myself and not to lose my temper. It is something that I’ve always lived by in life. On a show like this, where everything about us would be monitored and shown, I felt it would be best to present my true self,” says Shine, adding that adjusting to the environment in the house was hard at first. “I just looked at everyone as a joint family that I would be living with and that it was inevitable for one member to leave every week. It would only be rational to treat each of the members as family. There were times when I did lose my temper, but it was when I felt it was justified. But I did curse myself a lot for that later on. Barring those times, the stay in the house was fun,” Shine adds.One worry that Shine had was about holding his own in a house full of established names. “While I have done serials and some films, I realised I was not as popular as others in the house. While on one hand there were names like Jai Jagadish Kuri Prathap and Harish Raj , all of who have are known names in films, there was Vasuki Vaibhav , who has composed and sung big hit numbers. It was only later on in the show, when the percentage of votes I had received was revealed, that I gained confidence and shed my insecurities,” he admits.His game plan for the tasks on the show, he adds, was to play smart to win. “I’d never done anything like that in my life, but thankfully, none of the others had either. Assessing all my losses in games, I realised that I had to play smart to win. The ‘Kalla-Police’ task was my favourite. I was the inspector, while Vasuki and Harish were the social worker and fighter, respectively; Raju Talikote was my head constable. We all had some great conversations in the makeshift police station that was set up in the house,” he remembers.Shine, who has not had the time to check his social media accounts and respond to the good wishes personally, says that thanking fans will be his priority. “I also want to ensure I pursue my dream of making it in cinema. I’ve already had a few offers from filmmakers now. I will soon sit with them and see which would be the best to commence with soon,” he signs off.",tv,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73960424,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-205846/73960424.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//tv/news/kannada/i-have-never-won-anything-in-my-life-before-this-shine-shetty/articleshow/73960391.cms
12,['6/02/2020'],This A capella band aims at breaking barriers with music,"No doubt A cappella is a popular genre of music, but when it comes to bands dedicatedly following and practising it in India, the numbers are few. Chord 7 is trying to bridge that gap. Formed in January 2019, the group comprises Anish Bruce, Anish Varghese Tony Daniel , James Paul, Jibu John and Shiju Mathew . Based in three different cities, all the artistes have their regular careers to follow, but their passion for music has helped them keep the band alive. We recently caught up with Bengaluru-based Anish Bruce about their latest music and more. Excerpts from the chat:We wanted to dedicate our first song to the strings that bind us — choir music and being Malayalis. It took us around three days to rehearse and record the track. Back then, A cappella was something we were also trying out for the first time. Again, adjusting the work schedules of six professionals was a challenge. But the hard work and coordination paid off and it brought us where we are today.In the early days of the band, we used to connect with each other and even conduct jamming sessions on online platforms such as WhatsApp and Skype. Technology has played a huge role in our musical journey — be it in terms of recording tunes or working on different A capella versions of a song. The digital mediums have made it easier for us to manage our day jobs and make music.All the members of Chord 7 are hugely inspired by music composer AR Rahman .

Anjana, who also hails from the Pink City, was recently in town on a brief vacation.Anjana was in town for a brief vacation""My heart is in Jaipur. There is a certain amount of peace here, which we miss in the hectic life of Mumbai. When I am here, I am in no hurry to rush to the gym or to any official meeting. Here, I can just chill and relax. Jaipur is my refresh button,"" says Anjana. So what was her itinerary like this time around? Anjana tells us, ""I met my family members, went out with school friends and visited some new places to check out the all-new look of my city. Generally, I go bonkers when I am in Jaipur and then by the time I return to Mumbai, I have a few extra kilos on. So this time, I held myself back from over-eating.""""During my school days, there were very few places in C-Scheme and Raja Park areas to hang around with friends. But now I see a lot of fancy restaurants and hang out places here,"" she adds.The actress visited some new places tooAnjana began her Bollywood career with the multi-starrer Salaam-e-Ishq in 2007 and was recently seen in Akshay-Kareena-starrer Good Newws, after a sabbatical of almost two years. ""Yes, it was a two-year sabbatical. I lost my aunt to cancer. I was depressed as I was deeply attached to her. After a period of emotional turmoil, it's not easy to move on in life and feel happy.

16,['6/02/2020'],FIR filed against Joy Mukherjee for allegedly hitting his co-star,"Joy Mukherjee, the lead actor of Jiyon Kathi , has allegedly hit co-star Aindrila Sharma on the sets of the TV show. Recalling the incident, the actress told us, “I was giving close-up shots when my mother started calling me. Even though I answered her call only after completing my shot, Joy started yelling abuses at me and also said nasty things about my parents. He created a ruckus on the set.” “When I was stepping out to talk to my mother, he pulled my right arm forcefully and tried to stop me. I got badly hurt but he still continued to use filthy language and kept charging at me,” said the actress. After the incident on Monday, Aindrila filed an FIR at the Regent Park Police Station. Taken aback, Aindrila rushed to the makeup room to compose herself but Joy allegedly kept charging at her. “He was stopped by rest of the unit members but kept charging at me. I immediately informed the police but by the time they arrived, Joy had already left the set. Later, I, along with my unit members, went to the West Bengal Motion Picture Artists Forum to register a complaint. We talked to Forum officials Saptarshi Roy and member of the caretaker committee, Bharat Kaul. Other crew members shared similar instances of misbehaviour by Joy. I believe that Joy too complained against some actress to the Artists Forum” added Aindrila.Meanwhile, Joy, who initially refused to make any comment on the incident, said, “It’s too early to say anything. I heard that Aindrila has lodged a police complaint against me but no one from either Kolkata Police or West Bengal Police has contacted me yet. I will give a clarification to them first and then clear all other doubts by holding a press conference.” This is not the first time Joy has been accused of such harassment. The actor, who is known to be temperamental, was arrested in 2018 for harassing and physically abusing his former girlfriend, actress Sayantika Banerjee The serial Jiyon Kathi has been on air for the past four months and according to the lead actress, Joy keeps abusing someone or the other on the set. “I can’t ever imagine a man raising his hand against a woman. I was shocked to the core. In the four months that Joy and I have been working together for Jiyon Kathi, I have seen him get into tiffs with many members of the serial unit. I hope proper action is taken against him so that no has the audacity to behave in this horrible manner in future,” added Aindrila.West Bengal Motion Picture Artists Forum ex-secretary Saptarshi Roy said such incidents are harmful for the reputation of the film and TV industry. “We always want a peaceful work atmosphere. I am aware of the incident that took place on the sets of Jiyon Kathi and an internal committee will be set up to further probe the matter and come up with a solution,” he said. For now, the production house is planning to replace Joy with some other actor.",tv,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73961319,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-304294/73961319.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//tv/news/bengali/fir-filed-against-joy-mukherjee-for-allegedly-hitting-his-co-star/articleshow/73961319.cms
17,['6/02/2020'],"'If there’s any negativity, it’s outside the team'","This story is from February 6, 2020

Margao: Sergio Lobera may have parted ways with FC Goa but the Spanish coach has left his style and philosophy behind. It was quite evident as the league leaders defeated bottom-placed Hyderabad FC 4-1 at the Nehru Stadium, Fatorda, on Wednesday.

On paper, this should have been an easy game against the bottom-placed side but off field tensions made it the most intense in the campaign. Some fans stayed away, a section chanted Sergio’s name and there was no escaping a Tifo which said 'In Lobera we trust'.

Slow but steadily, though, the mood changed. There were cheers for the players, appreciation for the club and the unmissable ‘Forca Goa’.

It helped that Hugo Boumous scored in the 19th minute. His second goal proved that this team’s focus is certainly on the top spot, even though the attendance was recorded at 10,212, a marginal drop of 2,000 spectators compared to previous games.

“I don’t see any negativity in the team. May be whatever is there, it is outside the team. I could not see any sort of problems or difficulties inside the team. We are all professionals and you could see from the performance,” Goa’s interim coach Clifford Miranda told reporters after the emphatic victory.

Goa had some anxious moments in the initial minutes but slowly settled into their flow. Miranda and technical director Derrick Pereira fielded familiar faces in the starting lineup and the players responded well.

“It is a process, and can we forget what Sergio had done? No. He build this team and we cannot forget his contribution, not me nor the club. He made sure we played how we wanted to play as per our philosophy,” said Miranda.

Hyderabad interim coach Javier Lopez was also impressed with Goa’s performance.

“For me it’s not about the coach but the players always. FC Goa played much better and this is the work of Sergio Lobera over the last three years. There is a new coach and he continues the same job,” said Lopez.",goa,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-47529300,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-110164,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/if-theres-any-negativity-its-outside-the-team/articleshow/73970239.cms

Vartika Singh (BCCL/ Farhan Ahmad Siddiqui)

While Vartika Singh , Miss Diva Universe 2019, has spent most of her life in Lucknow, she misses the winter season when she’s living in Mumbai. In town recently, the model-actress revealed, “Just how people gear up for battle, I gear up for winters. I need to constantly have chai, hot water and I so love bonfires too. Something that I really look forward to is dressing up for winters because you get to wear boots, jackets, shawls, coats, etc and it’s great fun. Also, sitting outside in the sun with your family and friends during winters is a very special thing and I find it extremely cute and often miss it back in Mumbai.”Vartika, who was here on a professional commitment, further added, “One of the hardest things in winters, back when I was in college, was when you had to write exams in that cold weather. I remember I used to sit behind my friend on a bike and while she would ride it, I would be busy with my last-minute revisions and stuff. By the time we would reach the examination hall, my hands would be so numb that I used to rub them to warm them up so I could write the paper. I really miss those days.”She also tried her hands at making tandoori momos at an eatery in Gomti Nagar (BCCL/ Farhan Ahmad Siddiqui)The beauty also spoke about her love for tandoori chai and winter food. She said, “I’m almost obsessed with chai and specially the tandoori chai that I tried at 1090 Chauraha this time in Lucknow. It was so good. I’m rather shocked though that I didn’t quite know about it as yet. Also, I tried the momos at a popular momos place in Gomti Nagar and I think the food was just fabulous. Chikki is another one of my winter favourites.”Vartika, who recently represented India at the Miss Universe contest, couldn’t make it to the top 10. “Representing India at the Miss Universe level is a lifetime opportunity that you get, which you can’t miss. So whether you win or not, you always want to cherish this because you were the one who represented India at Miss Universe 2019 and no one in the world can take that away from you. Also, I’m very happy that I managed to make it to the top 20. I know one thing for sure that I did everything possible from my side, as a person, as an individual, as a candidate and as a representative of India. There are certain things that are destined and if it isn’t, then honestly I know there are better things in store for me and I’m looking forward to them,” she said, adding, “Having said that, I feel disappointment is a very natural thing that comes alongside as you put your heart and soul into it and you’ve been working for it non-stop, throughout to make it happen. However, when they did not announce my name for the next round, it did not really hit me in a bad way. I wasn’t like ‘oh my God! What has happened,’ because I knew one thing that I had given my best and that feeling of security from your end about your performance is very important. Therefore, I do not have any regrets nor any kind of disappointment about the results.”Vartika Singh (BCCL/ Farhan Ahmad Siddiqui)The stunning beauty also confessed that although modelling didn’t seem like a very convincing career to her parents initially, they were with her at every step of the way rooting and cheering for her. “Many people were rooting for me and just like myself they also thought that I’m going to win but it didn’t really happen. My dad would pray longer and slightly more. My mother told me how he (my dad) was awake early in the morning to watch the pageant. It meant a great deal for me considering my parents never imagined me to be in this profession and today they are really supportive and standing beside me at every step. It’s quite amazing and that’s what I discovered through this. It couldn’t have been any better,” said the diva.— Yashi Agarwal",lucknow,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73961731,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-405361,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/im-obsessed-with-chai-and-specially-the-tandoori-chai-vartika-singh/articleshow/73961720.cms

Sugandha Date (BCCL/ Aditya Yadav)

Singing reality show winner Sugandha Date, on her first visit to Lucknow, tried the famous basket chaat along with the kulfi. “I absolutely love this city. The hospitality here is second to none. In the evening I have plans of shopping, specially since the chikan kurtas are famous here, I really want to check them out,” said the young singer.

The Nagpur-girl spoke about her musical journey and said, “It has not been a very easy journey, we all faced many ups and downs. My guiding light throughout my musical journey has been my guru Anand Sharma sir. Its been almost six years since I have been learning classical music from my guruji. Had it not been for him and my ever so supporting family, I don’t think I would’ve won the coveted trophy.” The Lil’ Champs winner also revealed that her mother completed her MA in music but doesn’t sing anymore. “Mummy ka gaana peechhe chhoot gaya meri wajah se. She unfortunately doesn’t practice it anymore. In fact, my entire family shifted from Nagpur to Mumbai so I could pursue my singing career. I lack the words to define the amount of love and respect I have for my family.”

There are many reality shows these days centred around kids. Speaking about the trend, Sugandha said, “I can’t say for all, but as for me, I have enjoyed my musical journey at every step. The only pressure I felt was the pressure to work harder and get better, which I would say is the case in life also. One needs to constantly work on oneself, keep enhancing their skills and get better with every passing day. It’s about how well a kid manages his or her time and studies. I try to maintain a balance between singing which I’m very passionate about and school. Luckily for me, my school was very supportive too, so that really helped.”

In a chat with BT, he spoke about his stint in the house and his messy equation with his former girlfriend. Excerpts...Not at all. I retaliated only when she treated me badly, insulted me or abused me. Given our past, I wasn’t ready to meet her again on the show because I knew that if Madhurima entered the house, we would have fights. She would get aggressive, hit me and, like always, I would take it quietly, which is exactly what happened. I regret the fact that I didn’t mention that she should not be a part of the show in my contract. I believe that before entering the house she said that she had moved on, which she says all the time, while I have always maintained that I have a soft corner for her and I am in love with her. Par ab kuchh nahi hai. I won’t call our relationship a mistake, but we were two incompatible people trying to be together. We were wrong for each other.

I have never done that. Maine life mein kabhi bhi unke upar haath nahi uthaya hai. Our relationship ended because she was abusive and violent.

Speaking about the trend, Sugandha said, “I can’t say for all, but as for me, I have enjoyed my musical journey at every step. The only pressure I felt was the pressure to work harder and get better, which I would say is the case in life also. One needs to constantly work on oneself, keep enhancing their skills and get better with every passing day. It’s about how well a kid manages his or her time and studies.

यह ट्रस्ट मंदिर से सम्बंधित हर निर्णय लेने के लिए पूर्ण रूप से स्वतंत्र होगा और 67 एकड़ भूमि ट्रस्ट को हस्तांतरित… https://t.co/KBjKpljuzV — Amit Shah (@AmitShah) 1580884443000

NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Wednesday announced the formation of a trust for the construction of a Ram temple in Ayodhya, following the Cabinet clearing a detailed scheme for the shrine and its surrounding complex. The announcement came just four days before the threemonth deadline set by the Supreme Court was to end.“The government has, as per the directions of the SC, paved the way for the construction of a grand Ram temple at the Ramjanmabhoomi site. The issue pertains to sensitivities and faith of crores of people in the country and it is my good fortune that I am making this announcement,” the PM told the Lok Sabha amid thumping of desks in BJP benches with home minister Amit Shah leading the way. BJP members also raised “Jai Shri Ram” slogans. The decision, coming days before polling in Delhi, lent itself to political interpretations, but the opposition steered clear of such allegations, perhaps keeping in mind the emotive nature of the issue.In fact, Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal said, “Some people are asking about the timing. There is no right time for good work.” The PM said the government has transferred to the trust 67.7 acres of land for what he called a “grand and divine” Ram temple.The formation of the trust marks another important step towards the implementation of the Sangh Parivar’s agenda and BJP’s poll pledge for the construction of Ram Mandir . Modi said the SC verdict had been met with great maturity and that Indian culture and tradition are based on the philosophy of “Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam” and “Sarve Bhavantu Sukhinah”.In a message of unity, he said all faiths in India — whether Hindus, Muslims, Sikhs, Christians, Buddhists, Parsis or Jains — are members of one large family. “My government is moving ahead with the mantra of ‘Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas and Sabka Vishwas’ so that every member of this family develops, remains happy and healthy, becomes prosperous and the country progresses.” Political circles noted that the announcement had been made by the PM, who in the case of two earlier eventful decisions of his second tenure — voiding of Article 370 and bifurcation of J&K, and the passage of the Citizenship (Amendment) Act — had opted to take the back seat, letting his trusted colleague and home minister to pilot the two initiatives.Shah took to Twitter to congratulate the PM emphasising the provision to ensure that at least one member of the 15strong temple trust will be a Dalit. The trust will be called “Shri Ram JanmabhoomiTeerth Kshetra” and the PM said it will have full autonomy to construct a “magnificent and divine Shri Ram temple at the birthplace of Bhagwan Shri Ram in Ayodhya and take decisions on matters connected with it”.In Video: #RamMandir: Narendra Modi announces formation of Sri Ram Janmabhoomi Teerth Kshetra",india,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73970961,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-146059,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/govt-forms-trust-in-major-step-towards-building-ram-temple/articleshow/73970975.cms
28,['6/02/2020'],Nirbhaya: Avail of all options in one week: Delhi HC to Nirbhaya convicts,"NEW DELHI: Putting a lid on delaying tactics by the Nirbhaya death row convicts, Delhi high court on Wednesday gave them seven days to avail their remaining legal remedies while asserting that all four must hang together.The court dismissed the Centre’s plea to allow separate hanging of the four convicts, observing that no matter what stage of the case, all procedures “must be fair, just and reasonable”. Meanwhile, President Ram Nath Kovind had rejected the mercy petition of one of the convicts, Akshay Kumar Singh, who had filed the plea last week. The HC order means that Pawan Gupta, the only Nirbhaya convict who hasn’t filed a curative petition in the Supreme Court or a mercy plea with the President, now has a week’s time to exercise these options. The four can be hanged only after 14 days from the rejection of the last mercy plea.While ruling that the four must hang together, Justice Suresh Kait agreed with the central government’s argument that Delhi prison rules allow separate hanging of a convict once his mercy plea stands rejected. But the court stressed that the fundamental rights guaranteed under Article 21 of the Constitution were “as much relevant at the stage of execution of the death sentence as they are in the interregnum between the imposition of that sentence and its execution”. The court said all the four convicts have to be executed together since they were handed down the death penalty by a common judgment. “It is not in dispute that the trial court convicted all the accused by common judgment and was confirmed by this court vide common judgment and the Supreme Court thereafter confirmed it vide common judgment. Thus, from trial court up to the Supreme Court, all the convicts/accused were dealt by common order and judgment,” high court observed, noting that “I am of the considered opinion that death warrants of all the convicts be executed together and not separately”.Justice Kait noted that, by their conduct, the convicts had “frustrated the process by using delaying tactics” but then added that “so long as life lasts, so long shall it be the duty and endeavour of the court to give to the provisions of our Constitution a meaning which will prevent human suffering and degradation”.The high court also faulted the authorities concerned for not taking steps to issue death warrants after rejection of appeals of the convicts by the Supreme Court in 2017 and noted that the men have been found guilty of “a horrible, dreadful, cruel, abominable, ghastly, gruesome and heinous offence of rape coupled with a bone-chilling murder of a young woman, which shook the conscience of the entire country”. The Centre and the Delhi government had challenged the trial court’s January 31 order staying “till further orders” the execution of all the four convicts in the case — Mukesh Singh (32), Pawan Gupta (25), Vinay Sharma (26) and Akshay Thakur (31) — who are lodged in Tihar Jail.In Video: Nirbhaya case: All convicts will be hanged together, says Delhi HC",india,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73971070,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-102688,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/avail-of-all-options-in-one-week-delhi-hc-to-nirbhaya-convicts/articleshow/73971067.cms

NEW DELHI: Pitching for his development agenda for the city – even as BJP tries to corner him on the anti-CAA protests at Shaheen Bagh – chief minister Arvind Kejriwal told TOI in an exclusive interview on Wednesday that “21st-century India will not be built by CAA and NRC but by having better schools, colleges and hospitals”.

He accused Union home minister Amit Shah of letting the Shaheen Bagh blockade of a critical road fester for one-and-a-half months only for electoral gains. “He is India’s home minister and the most powerful man in the country. Nobody is going to believe that Amit Shah cannot get a road opened,” he said. The CM said BJP had no explanation for its non-performance in corporations and had failed to counter the work done by his government despite many attempts. So, finally, it had to attempt a Hindu-Muslim polarisation.

Read: Arvind Kejriwal's full interview

Kejriwal said he stayed away from Shaheen Bagh, Jamia and JNU because these are law-and-order issues and he had a different responsibility. It was up to Amit Shah to tackle it. But he blamed the Centre for the situation in universities, saying party politics should be kept away from university campuses.

Such politics was making parents insecure about their children, he said. Claiming that he had cordial relations with lieutenant governor Anil Baijal, Kejriwal said earlier he had been pushed into a confrontation with the Centre against his wishes. When the newly elected Delhi government felt it was unable to do anything, it made them restless. But the SC judgment clarifying the separation of powers restored peace.

Asked about Nirbhaya’s parents blaming him for the delay in hanging of the convicts, Kejriwal said they were simple folk and were being misled. He said the AAP government had no role to play in the entire process since the police were not under the city government.

Representative image

NEW DELHI: Cracking the whip on the Centre for permitting 576 government accommodation units to be illegally occupied by retired officials and ex-MPs, the Delhi high court on Wednesday gave it two weeks to start eviction proceedings.

A bench of Chief Justice D N Patel and Justice C Hari Shankar said the government must recover all pending dues from such occupants and rapped it for not initiating recovery proceedings against them, some of whom have overstayed for over a decade and racked up dues of over Rs 95 lakh. “If someone is overstaying in government accommodation, you do not need a five year plan to vacate them? Nearly 600 government accommodations were not vacated. Why have (you) not vacated them? Why no notice for recovery issued to them?” the bench demanded from the UD and housing ministry.

“If no stay (from a court or tribunal against their eviction), put their belongings, bag and baggage on the road within two weeks if they do not vacate on their own,” the court remarked, stressing that people are paying taxes “and you are giving free housing, electricity and water to them (illegal occupants) for years. In some cases, original allottee has died and their legal heirs are in occupation of the residence. This is nothing but your (ministry’s) inefficiency. This casual and lethargic approach indicates con nivance by your officials and connivance for such a long period amounts to conspiracy under the Indian Penal Code ,” the bench said slapping a cost on the ministry for being unable to inform it what steps have been taken to evict and recover dues.

HC’s directions came after going through an affidavit filed by the ministry indicating that 11 government residences were illegally occupied by ex-MPs, who had together run up dues of around Rs 35 lakh, while 565 units remain under occupation by retired babus. Referring to the huge amount of unrecovered dues, the bench said, “Prima facie the impression is you (ministry/officials) are making money from this. Someone is happy with this.”

32,['6/02/2020'],Bodh Gaya shrine: Government agencies conduct security audit,"This story is from February 6, 2020

Mahabodhi temple in Bodhgaya. (ANI photo)

GAYA: A security audit of Mahabodhi Temple conducted by government agencies has identified vulnerable points and recommended a more robust security mechanism to ensure the shrine’s security. Following the audit, the govt has recommended a slew of measures to tighten the shrine security.

The Bodh Gaya shrine , it may be recalled has twice been attacked by two different terrorist organisations. The first attack was engineered by a Ranchi based sleeping module of Indian Mujahedeen in July’2013. A couple of monks were injured in the low-intensity blasts. Again, in January’2018, Jamiatul Mujahedeen of Bangladesh was involved in planting explosives in the shrine vicinity.

According to highly reliable sources privy to the govt advisory, 17 different aspects of the shrine security have been dealt with, the most important being the effective handling of door frame metal detectors and scanning of all items being taken inside the shrine including cameras.

The advisory said that for a more effective checking mechanism, the BMP personnel engaged in shrine security should get training from the CISF. It may be recalled is the specialised force to provide security to vital installations including airports.

Following the request by the then governor RS Gavai and CM Nitish Kumar after the July’2013 attack, the then Union home minister Sushil Kumar Shinde agreed to provide CISF cover to the shrine. But as the state govt wanted the centre to bear the cost of CISF cover and the Union Home ministry insisted on payment based CISF cover, the shrine security was ultimately handed over to the Bihar Military Police.

While evading the issue of advisory on shrine security, DM Abhishek Singh, the Gaya DM cum chairman of the Bodh Gaya Temple Management committee said that the shrine security was a dynamic process and need-based improvements are periodically made to strengthen the security mechanism. Asked what measures are being taken to make the security more effective, the DM said that an additional watchtower would be constructed in the nearby JP Botanical garden.

More lights are being installed to improve all-round visibility during the dark hours, the shrine outer walls have been made impregnable and entry and exit points have been separated.

Asked about reports that special passes for carrying items like mobile phones and cameras and vehicle passes to move in the no vehicle zone are being liberally issued without proper verification of the antecedents of the special pass recipients, the DM said that some relaxation has to be made during occasions like special prayer sessions but the BTMC Secretary exercises due caution in the issuance of special passes. The DM also said that police verification of shop keepers and those living in the shrine vicinity is periodically done.

Being a living temple attracting visitors from across the globe, the shrine can not be converted into a police camp, said Singh.

33,['6/02/2020'],Mahathir Mohamed: Is Pakistan-Malaysia joint statement a sign of Mahathir climbdown?,"<p><br>Reuters photo</p>

NEW DELHI: Even as Malaysian prime minister, Mahathir Mohamed , refrained from mentioning the Kashmir issue in a joint press statement with Pakistan PM Imran Khan , the MEA told parliament on Wednesday that on both Kashmir and CAA , India “expects these countries to not comment on the internal affairs of India; respect India’s sovereignty and territorial integrity; and develop a proper understanding of the issue.”A joint statement issued by Malaysia and Pakistan at the end of Khan’s visit merely recorded that Imran Khan had raised the issue of Kashmir during his talks with Mahathir. The statement did not specify that both sides had agreed on Kashmir. The statement said, “The Prime Minister of Pakistan briefed the Prime Minister of Malaysia on the illegal and unilateral actions of the Indian Government of 5 August 2019…”It could be a sign that Mahathir may be climbing down from his earlier strident position on Kashmir and CAA. After India hit out at Malaysia with a virtual ban on palm oil imports from that country, Mahathir surprisingly said he would not retaliate. In the past weeks, Malaysia has raised its sugar imports from India as a sweetener.Meanwhile, the MEA in a written reply to Parliament Questions in Lok Sabha said, the government had briefed members of the international community “on the facts relating to Jammu & Kashmir and also shared perspectives on the Citizenship Amendment Act, 2019”.Trouble with Malaysia had started when Mahathir told the UN general assembly in September last year that India had “invaded and occupied” Kashmir. Despite some strongly worded pushback from India, Mahathir had refused to back down. This led to India putting curbs on imports of palm oil from Malaysia. Imran Khan promised to buy more palm oil from Malaysia to offset the gap created by India. However, according to official figures, India imported 4.4 million tonnes from Malaysia in 2019, while Pakistan had taken just over 1 million tonnes.Interestingly, Khan’s visit to Kuala Lumpur also saw Malaysia agreeing to maintain the “centrality” of the OIC as the premier global Islamic countries’ organisation. Malaysia, along with Turkey, Iran and Pakistan were trying to build an alternative Islamic countries grouping, which was scotched by Saudi Arabia when they persuaded Pakistan to stay away.Meanwhile, the MEA told Parliament countries have “shown understanding … that matters related to Jammu & Kashmir, which is an integral part of India, are internal to India; and that Pakistan sponsored cross-border terrorism has been posing a grave threat and affecting the lives of the people of India, including in Jammu & Kashmir.” In the face of criticism by global media and civil society, the government said the Indian position on the CAA is that it is “an affirmative action meant to address the long standing predicament of the vulnerable sections living in India; and that it does not impact in any manner on the status of any citizen of India or deprive any Indian of any faith of her or his citizenship.”The UN Human Rights Commissioner had on December 13 criticised the CAA, which the government described as “inaccurate and unwarranted”. “Government immediately registered its protest with the office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights and clearly conveyed that the legislation is a humanitarian measure and is in line with India’s international human rights obligations.”",india,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73971322,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-97741,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/is-pakistan-malaysia-joint-statement-a-sign-of-mahathir-climbdown/articleshow/73971343.cms

NEW DELHI: The government is looking to introduce pre-filled forms with your capital gains data on mutual fund and share sales in time for you to file the income tax returns by the end of July. While the government has introduced amendments to the Income Tax Act through the Finance Bill, which will empower it to seek data on the annual financial statement, sources said work has already begun on implementing the changes in the next few months itself.“We have held discussions with brokerages and other participants and suggested that the data should be made available to us so that taxpayers can get them in their pre-filled return forms,” a senior official in the tax department told TOI.Regulators such as the Securities & Exchange Board of India (Sebi) have also been consulted to include dividend income within the ambit. In any case, the proposed amendment for tax deducted at source (TDS) on dividend income beyond Rs 5,000 will be captured in the 26AS form and will help in pre-filling the returns forms.On August 19 last year, TOI was the first to report about the move to expand the pre-filled forms to include details other than interest accruing to the bank account that is mentioned in the returns to get a tax refund. The idea is to expand the scope to cover all bank accounts, which can easily be done using Aadhaar and permanent account number (PAN).Last year, the government had introduced pre-filled forms, which had faced some glitches initially. But the tax department believes that they have been more or less resolved, paving the way to expand the scope.Officials said that the idea is to simplify things for an average taxpayer, which reduces the need for visiting a chartered accountant and makes the process seamless.

The proposal has received the cabinet’s nod.”Faizabad district was officially renamed Ayodhya on November 13, 2018, although many people continue to refer to it by its old name. The adjoining city of Faizabad officially retains its original name.UP government spokesperson Shrikant Sharma said three options had been presented to the state cabinet by district authorities. “The government forwarded a shortlist of plots near highways passing through Ayodhya to the Centre, which picked the one at Dhannipur village on Lucknow-Gorakhpur highway.”According to the official, the proximity of the plot to a highway and a police station (Raunahi) swung the decision in its favour. “Proximity to the highway means pilgrims can reach the mosque easily. A police station in the vicinity makes it an even better choice since maintaining communal harmony and law and order is also a priority,” he said.Sources in the government said the Hindu litigants demanded that land for the mosque be allotted outside the “panchkosi parikarma”, the traditional 15km route that devotees take to pay obeisance to Lord Ram in Ayodhya. “Dhannipur made the cut in this respect, too.

Representative image

THRISSUR: Wishing wells may exist only in folklore, but one in Kerala almost proved a tippler’s wildest fantasy come true. It all started when residents of Solomon ’s Avenue apartment complex in Chalakudy town of Thrissur district noticed brownish water with an unmistakable smell gushing out of their kitchen taps a couple of days ago. Turns out the sober, dependable neighbourhood well had overnight turned into a watering hole — literally — and started serving up a cocktail of beer, brandy and rum through kitchen taps.

The mystery was solved after some residents approached the municipality authorities, who traced the “hiccup” to an excise department operation in the area a few days earlier. The excise team had apparently dumped more than 4,500 litres of seized liquor into a pit, unaware that most of it would flow into a nearby well that is the main source of potable water for Solomon’s Avenue residents. Joshy Maliyekkal, who was among the first to spot brownish water coming out of taps, said he initially suspected a rusting pipe had something to do with it.

“I had barely switched on my water pump to fill the overhead tank on Sunday afternoon when the sight of the water got me really scared. And the smell was unmistakable and the taste confirmed that someone mixed copious amounts of alcohol with the water,” Maliyekkal said. When all 18 families living in the complex had the same experience as Joshy, they decided to contact the Chalakudy municipality Ward councillor VJ Joji told TOI on Wednesday that alternative water-supply arrangements had been made for the affected families. “These families had been using water from the contaminated well for several years. It was their only water source,” he said.

Deputy excise commissioner TK Sanu said the well had been “cleaned” at least eight times already to remove all traces of liquor in the water. “Till the water becomes completely clean, we will provide drinking water to the affected families.”

According to Sanu, the excise department had decided to “destroy” the seized liquor because storing the bottles had become a challenge. “These bottles had been seized from bars whose licenses had been cancelled six years ago. We couldn't have known that our operation would raise such a stink,” he said.

NEW DELHI: A parliamentary select committee on Wednesday recommended key changes to the Surrogacy (Regulation) Bill, 2019, including allowing a “willing woman” and not just “close relative” to become a surrogate mother, omission of fiveyear wait period before opting for surrogacy, and allowing single women – either divorcee or widow – in the 35- to 45-year age group and persons of Indian origin (PIOs) to avail of surrogacy.

The panel also recommended increasing the insurance cover for surrogate mothers from 16 months to 36 months. While endorsing the ban on commercial surrogacy, the panel, led by BJP MP Bhupender Yadav, suggested keeping an option for compensating the surrogate mother beyond medical expenses and insurance coverage.

The House committee, led by BJP MP Bhupender Yadav, suggested keeping an option for compensating the surrogate mother beyond medical expenses and insurance coverage that includes taking care of her nutritional food requirements, maternity wear, etc. that is vital for the well-being and upkeep of the surrogate mother.

The Rajya Sabha select committee that examined the bill argued that restricting the surrogate mother to a “close relative” potentially affects the availability of surrogate mothers. “A willing woman shall act as a surrogate mother and be permitted to undergo surrogacy procedures as per the pro visions of this Act,” the committee said in its report submitted onWednesday.

Regarding the requirement of five years as the period of inability to conceive before opting for surrogacy, the committee said that there may be certain proven medical conditions like absence of uterus by birth, non-functional uterus, removal of uterus due to cancer, fibroids etc or patients with chronic medical condition where normal pregnancy is ruled out and it is medically proven beyond any doubt that surrogacy is the only option.

The panel further observed that the requirement of obtaining certificate of proven infertility is not at all justified in such cases.

NEW DELHI: As members raised concern over unemployment rates and cited previous labour force surveys to drive home their point, minister for labour and employment Santosh Gangwar informed Parliament on Wednesday said that an attempt is being made to improve the data collection by adding various parameters and provide more authentic data.

The minister said it will take time for collection of data as households have to be visited on the ground for authentic data collection in rural areas also. “As per the Periodic Labour Force Survey , the labour force participation is 36.9% and the rate of unemployment for 201718 is 6.1%,” he said.

NEW DELHI: There is a logjam in adjudication of thousands of pending appeals against grant or rejection of patents, copyrights, trademarks and orders on plant varieties protection as the Intellectual Property Appellate Board (IPAB) lacks adequate number of judicial and technical members to decide them.

Chairman of IPAB, Justice (retired) Manmohan Singh, has been functioning on extension as directed by the SC on December 18. Appearing for petitioner NGO ‘Protection of Intellectual Property (India Group)’, senior advocate Arvind Datar told a bench of Chief Justice S A Bobde and Justices B R Gavai and Surya Kant that no patent appeal has been taken up by IPAB since May 2016, which is a serious situation.

The CJI-led bench, which on December 18 had said “appointment process of the new chairman of the said Board according to law is likely to be complete soon”, conceded on Wednesday that attempts to persuade a retired judge to take up the assignment as IPAB chairman have not borne fruit as no one wants to go to Chennai, where the Board has its headquarters.

“This (selection of IPAB chairman) is something which I have to do. problem is relating to finding a retired judge who is willing to shift to Chennai,” CJI Bobde said. He had on December 18 asked attorney general K K Venugopal to obtain “instructions from the government about relocation of the Principal Bench of Madras or location of a new Bench to a central place in the country such as Nagpur, Jabalpur, Bhopal”.

On Wednesday, the CJI again pushed afresh for relocation of the principal IPAB bench to Nagpur, his home town. “Nagpur is central to India. It is equi-distant from Kashmir and Kanyakumari . It is also well connected,” he said. When AG said the government is ready to consider setting up a IPAB bench at Nagpur, the CJI said, “Nagpur itself will not have sufficient litigation for the IPAB bench as the industrial areas of Maharashtra were in Mumbai, Pune, Thane and Nashik. Unless the principal bench is shifted to Nagpur, the purpose would not be served.”

But the AG said Tamil Nadu should have some central institutions. The CJI said, “Chennai does not seem to be a right place for its head-quarters. It is unprecedented. No one wants to go there because of its location.” He asked AG and other counsel to suggest names of suitable candidates for the post of IPAB chairman without informing the candidates to facilitate making a proper choice.

File photo

NEW DELHI: High school reunions are magical and this one has made “Kunal Kamra” board an Air India flight followed by another one on IndiGo in the last three days. Before you think these airlines have lifted their controversial ban on the standup comedian, the person who flew — with some difficulty to be sure — is his NRI namesake who is in India to attend his reunion.

“I was booked on Air India’s Jaipur-Mumbai flight this Monday. At the airport check-in counter, I was told my PNR had been cancelled as I was on their blacklist,” Boston-based Kamra told TOI. Once he convinced AI that he is not the Kunal Kamra banned by them, the airline issued him a boarding card for Mumbai on AI 612.

AI spokesman Dhananjay Kumar said: “(Standup comedian) Kunal Kamra is barred from flying Air India. That is mentioned in our system. Due to this, (NRI) Kunal Kamra’s name was automatically rejected (for issuance of boarding card). After we verified credentials of this passenger (to ensure he is not the comedian Kamra), we allowed him board to board the flight.”

Having learnt his lesson, “Kamra” went to IndiGo counter at Jaipur airport itself as he had booked Wednesday’s 6E 174 from Mumbai to Delhi. “I told them that the same thing should not happen in Mumbai with me as I am not that Kunal Kamra,” he told TOI after flying into Delhi on the IndiGo flight.

In fact when standup comedian Kamra confronted TV anchor Arnab Goswami on IndiGo’s Mumbai-Lucknow flight last Tuesday and then got banned from flying by IndiGo, AI, SpiceJet and GoAir, this NRI namesake was preparing for the upcoming India trip. “My friends told me to be careful as I could be mistaken for the other Kunal Kamra since I had booked flights on these airlines. But I felt airlines would know how to differentiate between two people with same name,” Kamra, an insurance professional in Boston , said.

Assured of that, NRI Kamra landed in Delhi last Friday (Jan 31) and same day left for Ranthambore by train to attend his high school 20-year reunion. From there he went by road to Jaipur. The first flight on the India trip was from Jaipur to Mumbai on Monday when he realised what it is to be Kunal Kamra booked on an airlines that have banned the comedian.

Indian carriers had got a lot of practice of spotting blacklisted names trying to book tickets when in summer of 2017 when an MP was blacklisted by all Indian carriers after he threatened to beat up an AI staffer onboard an aircraft. The politician tried to book tickets under different names on various airlines but they all managed to spot him and cancel the tickets till the ban was lifted following an order from the aviation ministry.

Asked how he felt about this episode, the NRI Kamra said: “I feel really bad for the comedian for what he has to go through to go from place to place. For me it was a minor inconvenience that got sorted out. I hope my story is a warning for other people that they may have to go through the same experience.”

Comedian Kamra has legally challenged IndiGo’s controversial decision.

43,['6/02/2020'],SC gives Rs 1cr to accident victim,"This story is from February 6, 2020

NEW DELHI: A decade after a 12-year-old girl met with an accident which led to 100 per cent physical disability and left her with the mental age of a nine-month-old for the rest of her life due to brain injuries, the Supreme Court on Wednesday came to her rescue awarding compensation of more than Rs one crore including interest.

Kajal, a bright young girl, was travelling on a tractor with her parents on October 18, 2007 when it was hit by a truck. She suffered serious injuries resulting in damage to her brain and was left with a very low IQ besides severe weakness in all her limbs. As per the medical report, her mental age will remain that of a 9-month old child throughout her life. This means while lying on the bed, she will grow with physical and biological attributes of an adult woman, including menstruation etc, but remain a 9- month old child in her mind.

Noting that the pain and suffering which Kajal , who has turned 24, has to go through the rest of her life, a bench of Justices L Nageswara Rao and Deepak Gupta said this is a case where departure has to made from the normal rules to do justice and assuage her suffering. The court awarded a compensation of Rs 62.27 lakh to her along with interest at the rate of 7.5 percent per annum on that amount since 2007.

“This child will remain bed-ridden for life. Her mental age will be that of a nine-month old child. Effectively, while her body grows, she will remain a small baby. We are dealing with a girl who will physically become a woman but will mentally remain a 9-month old child. This girl will miss out playing with her friends. She cannot communicate; she cannot enjoy the pleasures of life; she cannot even be amused by watching cartoons or films; she will miss out on the fun of childhood, the excitement of youth; pleasures of a marital life; she cannot have children who she can love let alone grandchildren. She will have no pleasure. Hers is a vegetable existence,” the court said.

The court passed the order on an appeal filed by Kajal’s father who approached the SC through advocate Dhruv Gautam challenging the Punjab and Haryan HC order for granting compensation of Rs 25.78 lakh. The bench agreed with his submission and enhanced the compensation by almost four times.

The court granted compensation on different counts of which Rs 21.6 lakh was given for attendant charges as she will be need two attendants for the rest of his life . “We must remember that this little girl is severely suffering from incontinence meaning that she does not have control over her bodily functions like passing urine and faeces. As she grows older, she will not be able to handle her periods. She requires an attendant virtually 24 hours a day. She requires an attendant who though may not be medically trained but must be capable of handling a child who is bed- ridden. She would require an attendant who would ensure that she does not suffer from bed sores,” it said.

“It is impossible to equate human suffering and personal deprivation with money. However, this is what the Act enjoins upon the courts to do. The court has to make a judicious attempt to award damages, so as to compensate the claimant for the loss suffered by the victim. On the one hand, the compensation should not be assessed very conservatively, but on the other hand, compensation should also not be assessed in so liberal a fashion so as to make it a bounty to the claimant. The court while assessing the compensation should have regard to the degree of deprivation and the loss caused by such deprivation, ” it said.

Representative image

NEW DELHI: The Shri Ram Janmbhoomi Teerth Kshetra Trust will have 15 members, one of whom will be from the Dalit community, Home minister Amit Shah said on Wednesday, soon after Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced the cabinet decision to set up the Trust in Lok Sabha.

The Trust’s registered office will be at R-20 in Delhi’s Greater Kailash Part-I, also the residence-cum-office of K Parasaran, former Attorney General and senior advocate who had argued on behalf of the deity Ram Lalla Virajman in the Supreme Court. The 93-year old Parasaran will also be one of the trustees in Shri Ram Teerth Kshetra.

The trustees include Jagatguru Shankaracharya Jyothishpeethadheeshwar Swami Vasudevanand Saraswati, Prayagraj; Jagatguru Madhavacharya Swami Vishwa Prasannatheertha, Pejawar math, Udupi; Yugpurush Paramanand Maharaj, Haridwar; Swami Govinddev Giri Maharaj, Pune; Vimlendra Mohan Pratap Mishra, Ayodhya; Dr Anil Mishra, homoeopathic doctor, Ayodhya; Kameshwar Chaupal, Patna; and Mahant Dinendra Das, Nirmohi Akhara, Ayodhya. Mishra is included as a descendant of Ayodhya rulers.

The district collector of Ayodhya will be ex-officio trustee and shall be a practising Hindu. If the incumbent collector is not a practising Hindu, the additional collector will need to be one, making the trust an all-Hindu affair. There will also be a representative to be nominated by the Centre, an IAS officer not below the rank of joint secretary. One representative will be nominated by UP government. A chairman of a committee for development and administration will be appointed by the Board of Trustees.

Voting in the Board will be limited to a set of 10 trustees, mainly religious figures associated with the Trust. These trustees will essentially be members till they pass away or choose to resign.

Soon after the Supreme Court pronounced the Ayodhya verdict on November 9, 2019, RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat and senior Sangh leader Suresh Bhaiyaaji Joshi had visited Parasaran — a Padma Vibhushan and Padma Bhushan awardee — to thank him. He later visited the makeshift temple where the idol is currently placed.

The gazette notification issued by the home ministry on Wednesday stated that it had approved the scheme, as directed by the Supreme Court, that makes necessary provisions in regard to functioning of the Trust including matters relating to management of the Trust, powers of the trustees, including construction of the temple, and all necessary, incidental and supplemental matters.

It stated that possession of inner and outer courtyards of the disputed site — or the 1,500 square yards area over which the Babri Masjid was built — shall be handed over to the Trust.

On why the home ministry notification called the 1,500 sq yard site — which SC had held to be in ownership of Ram Lalla Virajman — as ‘disputed’, an officer explained it was referred as such in the Supreme Court verdict of November, 2019. It had stated that “possession of the disputed property shall continue to vest in the statutory receiver under the Central Government until in exercise of its jurisdiction under Section 6 of the Ayodhya Act of 1993, a notification is issued vesting the property in the trust or other body”.

The Centre said it had decided, in consultation with the UP government, to allot a suitable 5-acre plot at a prominent place in Ayodhya, outside the land acquired under the Acquisition of Certain Areas at Ayodhya Act, 1993, to Sunni Central Waqf Board for building a mosque.

The decision, it said, had taken into account past history of communal disturbances and possible scenarios relating to public order and considering the large number of pilgrims visiting the land acquired throughout the year. It also kept in mind essential amenities that would require to be provided for the increase in number of pilgrims from all across the world in future.

The allotment letter of five acres of land in Ayodhya to the Sunni Waqf Board was issued by the UP government on Wednesday.

The SC had also ruled that the central government was at liberty to make suitable provisions in respect to the rest of the acquired land by handing it over to the said Trust for management and development. On Wednesday, the Centre said that upon being satisfied that the Trust is willing to comply with terms and conditions, it “directs that all rights, title and interests in relation to the entire area acquired under the Schedule to the said Act, including the inner and outer courtyard of the disputed site, shall vest in the said Shri Ram Janmbhoomi Teerth Kshetra”.

45,['6/02/2020'],Congress: Politics over Lord Ram must end now,"This story is from February 6, 2020

NEW DELHI: A day before Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced the formation of a trust for a Ram temple and sent BJP on a Hindutva messaging overdrive, Congress experts on NPR-NRC heard concerns that the party needs to craft a political message to blunt the saffron offensive of painting the opposition as “pro-minority”.

The opposition to the new citizenship measures, felt a section of Congress, exposes the party to being too closely aligned with a cause that might alienate sections of Hindu opinion. The thinking encapsulated worries in Congress ranks that unceasing protests against CAA , though they may have rattled BJP for a while, have led to a saffron response that is potentially polarising and effective.

If fears of Hindutva pitch exist on CAA, the renewed BJP push on Ayodhya only compounds the pre-existing concerns in Congress, eager to avoid the return of political confrontation to “secular versus communal” battle lines. At a function in Mumbai in March, 2018, Sonia Gandhi had said BJP had persuaded voters to see Congress as a “Muslim party”.

Ayodhya as such may not be the worry for Congress and other parties, which feel the Supreme Court order settling the vexed issue in favour of a temple removed a contentious plank that lends itself to mobilisation. It was this hope that prompted most in the anti-BJP axis to welcome the apex court verdict.

But its revival as a public development poses a challenge if BJP uses it to stoke its majority base against the CAA-NRC, by clubbing the two sensitive subjects as part of “minority politics” of rivals. The matter is made more problematic with Congress even opposing the national population register, an exercise mandated under the census, on the grounds that it will be a precursor to a national register of citizens.

When asked about the Ayodhya trust, Congress said it welcomed the Supreme Court decision on the temple issue and respected it. In the same breath, they also said the party hoped this would now put an end to “politics over Lord Ram”.

“When Supreme Court delivered its verdict, we welcomed it. The government is merely following the rules laid down by the apex court. We want that politics over Lord Ram should end and seeking votes in his name should end. It is a matter of faith,” said Congress MP and spokesperson Gaurav Gogoi.

“If people want to practice their faith they will go to the new Ram Mandir to do that. We don’t need the BJP government to tell us about religion,” Gogoi said. He also claimed Congress practices faith “much better than BJP”. “BJP practises fake nationalism and fake religion,” he said.

The party appears alive to the need to redirect the debate to NPR-NRC being inimical to “all the poor”. As a party functionary explained, Rahul Gandhi started by drawing a parallel between NRC and “demonetisation”, arguing both hurt the poor. “If the poor stood in queues for days to exchange their old currency and withdraw money, they would now have to run from pillar to post to produce documents to prove their citizenship,” he said.

Rahul’s decision to embark on a string of rallies on the economy are also part of the plan to refocus on the plank of “have-nots” and the youth. Congress is likely to launch a campaign to sensitise the people on how the “poor, SC/ST, migrants” and not just Muslims, would be hurt by the NRC. Congress believes this can put a political cost on BJP’s Hindutva overdrive, even as the saffron party argues protests as essentially led by Muslim groups.

At an in-house briefing on Tuesday, Congress flagged eight “superfluous” questions in the NPR questionnaire that it wants should be deleted, underlining that NPR would form the basis of NRC in future.

NEW DELHI: Union home minister Amit Shah on Wednesday welcomed the decision over the formation of the Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Teertha Kshetra Trust, citing the inclusion of a permanent Dalit member as an unprecedented move towards strengthening social harmony.

Shah’s statement came soon after PM Narendra Modi announced in Lok Sabha about the constitution of the trust. “There will be 15 trustees in the Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Teertha Kshetra Trust out of which one trustee will always be from the Dalit society,” Shah tweeted. He said the trust will be independent to take every decision related to the temple and 67 acres of land will be transferred to it.

“I fully believe that the waiting of millions of people for centuries will be over soon and they will be able to pay obeisance to Lord Shri Ram in his grand temple at his birthplace,” hesaid. Shah thanked the PM for his commitment for construction of a temple dedicated to Lord Ram, “who is a symbol of faith and unwavering reverence of India”.

Defence minister Rajnath Singh hailed the announcement saying the representation of scheduled castes in the trust will strengthen social harmony. “PM Modi has honoured the spirits of crores of citizens of this country by announcing the formation of Ram Temple Trust. With the representa tion of Dalit community in the trust, social harmony has been strengthened. I heartily congratulate the PM for this decision,” he said.

Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath hailed the decision saying that this trust will be completely independent and capable of making decisions related to temple construction. BJP functionary Uma Bharati on Wednesday said the move will silence critics who have been accusing the saffron party of demanding votes on the Ayodhya issue.

47,['6/02/2020'],Cabinet nod for Maharashtra deep port that will be among world’s top 10,"This story is from February 6, 2020

NEW DELHI: The Union Cabinet on Wednesday gave its “inprinciple” approval for setting up a major port at Vadhavan near Dahanu in Maharashtra and it will become the thirteenth major port in the country.

With 20 metre draft (depth), it will come up as one of the top 10 ports across the globe to receive mother ships, which currently come to Colombo or Singapore to offload the cargo to be transferred to Indian ports. This is the first project to be approved by the Cabinet, which was included in the Infrastructure Projects Pipeline.

Union shipping minister Mansukh L Mandaviya said the project will involve approximately Rs 64,545 crore investment. “The Centre will have 51% of share of the special purpose vehicle, which will be set up to develop the port. Maharashtra Maritime Board and private players can have the rest of the share in the SPV,” he said.

He said there will be hardly any requirement to acquire land for developing the port. Vadhavan port will be developed on “land lord model”. The SPV will be formed with Jawaharlal Nehru Port Trust as the lead partner and it will develop the port infrastructure including reclamation, construction of breakwater, besides establishing connectivity to the hin terland.

All the business activities would be undertaken under public private partnership mode by private developers. Currently, JNPT is the biggest container port in India and is ranked at 28th position globally with a traffic of 5.1 million TEUs (twenty-foot equivalent units). Even after the completion of fourth terminal at JNPT with a capacity increase up to 10 million TEUs by 2023, it will stand as the 17th largest container port in the world. Mandaviya said development of Vadhavan port will enable call of container vessels of 16,00025,000 TEUs capacity, giving advantages of economies of scale and reducing the logistics cost.

48,['6/02/2020'],5-acre land offer draws sharp reactions from Muslim side,"This story is from February 6, 2020

Representative image

LUCKNOW/DELHI: The UP Sunni Central Waqf Board on Wednesday withheld an official response to the Yogi Adityanath cabinet's offer of a 5-acre plot for the construction of a mosque till at least February 24, but its counsel and Babri Masjid Action Committee convener Zafaryab Jilani made no secret of his disappointment at the government choosing a location 25km away from the Ram Janmabhoomi site.

Jilani claimed the location of the 5 acres allotted at Dhannipur village in Ayodhya ’s Sohawal tehsil does not conform to what the Supreme Court mandated in its November 9 ruling in the Ram Janmabhoomi-Babri Masjid title suit.

""In all court documents that were part of the title suit, Ayodhya was a small town — a qasbah of Faizabad. This Ayodhya cannot be equated with the new district created by the government,"" Jilani said. ""Merely renaming a town and extending its municipal limits does not prove that the land offered is still in Ayodhya.""

Iqbal Ansari, whose father Hashim Ansari was one of the original litigants, said the land that the government had offered for the mosque should be used to build a dharamshala for devotees coming to Ayodhya, ""with the facility of free boarding and lodging"".

Sunni waqf board chairperson Zufar Faruqi, who is currently abroad, was unavailable for comment. The board’s CEO, Syed Mohammad Shoeb, told TOI that the members would decide on a response and an action plan at a meeting on February 24.

""A meeting of the Sunni waqf board is scheduled for February 24, where issues pertaining to waqf properties and legal matters were to be discussed. Ayodhya was not on the agenda, but given the recent events, the issue of land allotment might also be discussed in the meeting,"" Shoeb said. ""The board might also convene an emergency meeting before February 24 once the chairperson returns to the city.""

On November 26 last year, a meeting of eight members of the Sunni waqf board decided not to file a review petition against the Ayodhya verdict.

In Delhi, the All India Muslim Personal Law Board termed the UP government's offer ""unnecessary"", saying that accepting the 5-acre plot to build a shrine there in lieu of the Babri Masjid would be like ""rubbing salt on our wounds"".

Maulana Arshad Madani , president of the Jamiat Ulama-i-Hind, said the site where the Babri Masjid existed ""is a mosque as per Shariah and it would remain a mosque till the day of resurrection, no matter what form and name it is given, because no individual and party has the right to withdraw his claim from any mosque to any alternative"".

""Accepting land in the name of a mosque is against the principles of Islam laid out in the Shariah. So, this allotment of land by the UP government is unacceptable. Though the Sunni waqf board is free to take its decisions, in our opinion it should not take the offer. This is unacceptable,"" Madani added.

Muslim personal law board secretary Saifullah Rahmani said that ""as law-abiding citizens"", the Muslim side had chosen ""silence"" after the Supreme Court verdict rejecting its claim to the disputed site. ""However, on the issue of an alternative plot, we have always maintained that the Sunni waqf board should not accept it as this case was never about an alternative mosque"".

Rahmani confirmed this to be the ""official position"" of the Muslim personal law board.

Lawyer Jilani, who is also an executive member of the Muslim personal law board, said the allotment of land was not in conformity with the Acquisition of Certain Area at Ayodhya Act of 1993 and the Ismail Farooqi case of 1994. ""In both the Act and the case, it has been clearly mentioned that the 67-acre plot will be used to develop in a planned manner a temple, a mosque, a library, a museum and amenities for pilgrim. Whatever area is left will be given to the owners. The Supreme Court had upheld this in the Farooqi case of 1994.""

50,['6/02/2020'],Delhi polls: JD(U) pulls out all the stops to win over Bihari voters,"This story is from February 6, 2020

PATNA: With electioneering for Delhi assembly polls coming to end on Thursday evening, Bihar ’s ruling JD(U) on Wednesday pulled out all the stops to win the hearts of ‘Purvanchali’ voters to ensure victory of its candidates from Burari and Sangam Vihar.

JD(U) is contesting two out of total 70 assembly seats in Delhi where polling will be held on February 8 and counting of votes on February 11. Shailendra Kumar , who has roots in Sampatchak of Patna district, and former BJP MLA Dr Shiv Charan Lal Gupta are the JD(U) candidates from Burari and Sangam Vihar, respectively.

Besides fielding seven Bihar ministers to address mohalla-level events in the two constituencies, the party has deputed its 35 MLAs, MLCs and former legislators in the two constituencies for door-to-door contact programme with the help of local BJP and JD(U) cadres.

Moreover, JD(U)’s 16 Lok Sabha members and four of the six Rajya Sabha members visited the two constituencies. “As Budget session of Parliament is going on, all our MPs are in the national capital. Except two Rajya Sabha members — one is deputy chairman while other is sick — all our MPs are visiting the two constituencies on a regular basis to campaign for the party candidates,” JD(U) national general secretary Afaque Ahmad Khan told TOI over phone on Wednesday.

“Burari has six wards of Municipal Corporation of Delhi. We have lined up one legislator or former legislator for each ward. While Morwa (Samastipur) MLA Vidya Sagar Nishad has been made incharge of ward no. 6 and former Amnaur MLA Mantu Singh is conducting door-to-door campaign in ward no. 7. Similarly, Bagaha MLA Dhirendra Pratap Singh alias Rinku Singh has been deputed in ward no. 8, Agiaon MLA Prabhu Ram in ward no. 9, Kargahar MLA Bashishtha Singh (ward no.10) and former Bihar MLC Rudal Rai in ward no.11,” JD(U) MLC Ranbir Nandan, who is overall incharge of Burari constituency, told TOI.

At least 35 JD(U) legislators and former legislators are campaigning in the two constituencies.

Bihar CM Nitish Kumar has already addressed three election rallies in Delhi on Sunday and Monday and seven JD(U) ministers from Bihar have been touring the two constituencies for the last six days. “On Wednesday, Bihar’s rural development department minister Shravan Kumar addressed an election rally in Burari and IPRD minister Neeraj Kumar in Sangam Vihar,” Nandan said.

State's building construction minister Ashok Choudhary, who is campaigning in the two constituencies, said the winnability of JD(U) candidates had improved remarkably after the joint rally of Nitish and Union home minister Amit Shah on Sunday. “The issue of permit having been denied to Bihar buses up to Delhi by the Kejriwal government has become a topic of discussion in every Bihari house after Nitish raised it during the joint rally of the NDA leaders,” Choudhary said.

Autos ply on the Cossipore-BK Pal Ave route on Wednesday

KOLKATA: Commuting between Cossipore and B K Pal Avenue, which had turned nightmarish since Saturday morning after cops stopped autos from plying on that stretch, eased on Wednesday. Passengers who had braced for another day of travelling on over-crowded buses or walking long distances were surprised to see the three-wheelers back at the stand.

Anticipating that the Tallah Bridge shutdown would force light vehicles — that have been taking the bridge — to clog roads along the auto route from the 4B terminus to B K Pal Avenue, cops had barred autos from plying on this route. Commuters were forced to take buses on routes 242, 30A and 43, which were over-crowded with the extra passengers. People were seen clinging to the overhead rods at the gates of the buses with their feet barely touching the footboards. With complaints piling up, cops eventually allowed autos to resume services on the route.

Many, like Prasenjit Bera, had decided not to board the over-crowded buses and chose to walk. “I have to take my daughter to school from our home in Cossipore to Bagbazar. With autos on this route staying off the road, I had to walk with her all the way. We also returned on foot. I couldn’t have boarded those buses as it would be impossible — and dangerous — for my daughter to get into them,” he said.

Since the auto services were suspended, however, buses had been doing brisk business since Saturday morning. Since heavy vehicles were barred from plying along Tallah Bridge from last September, buses were re-routed along an additional 8km route. Bus operators’ unions have been complaining about the increased costs on account of the increased distance covered.

52,['6/02/2020'],West Bengal: Traffic islands planned to make crossing roads easy,"This story is from February 6, 2020

Representative image

KOLKATA: The traffic police are mulling the construction of pedestrian islands — spaces that will allow pedestrians crossing a busy intersection to wait safety. The move will ease the problems of pedestrians who use Chitpore bridge, those trying to cross over at the RG Kar Hospital gates and commuters at Paikpara . It will also ensure that cops can keep traffic flow towards the Chitpore Lockgate Bridge normal.

A pedestrian island is mostly found in the centre of roads without dividers. Pedestrians can cross the first half of the road and take refuge at an island while they wait for cars to clear before attempting to cross the second half. “The pedestrian islands will help decongest the area and ensure that signals are violated less,” an officer said.

Besides these islands, cops have decided to put up dedicated channels for pedestrian movement. They will also mark out spots for buses to stop across Chiria More, Indra Biswas Road and RG Kar Road. Any driver who stops the bus beyond the scheduled stops — thus holding up traffic — will be penalized.

Similarly, more civic volunteers will be deployed to ensure school children do not stray on to Cossipore Road.

53,['6/02/2020'],Bihar man who laid first brick is now trustee of Ram temple,"This story is from February 6, 2020

Kameshwar Chaupal

PATNA: On November 9, 1989, the BJP’s Dalit leader Kameshwar Chaupal had laid the first ‘Ram sila’ (brick) at Ayodhya as part of the legion of Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) volunteers gathered there for it. And, 31 years later on Wednesday, he said no one could fathom the ‘aanand’ (bliss) that he was feeling now that the temple dedicated to ‘Ram lalla’ would come up. The Centre on Wednesday formed a board of trustees for its construction, as asked by the Supreme Court.

Chaupal has also been made a member of the 15-member Trust constituted by the Centre on Wednesday to oversee the construction of Ram temple on 67 acre land at Ayodhya. The names of eight members have been disclosed so far.

“My appeal to all sections of society, whatever their religion, community and creed, is that they all should come forward and lend their support to building the temple. It would be a magnificent temple. It would also express the spirit of the country that is rooted in social harmony and well-being of all,” Chaupal said.

“If Mahatma Gandhi were alive, even he would have expressed the same feeling. He talked about ‘Ram raj’. Only after the temple dedicated to Lord Ram comes up, can there be any talk of ‘Ram raj’,” he added.

Chaupal, who belongs to Supaul district in north Bihar bordering Nepal, has been in Delhi for the last some weeks to campaign for the BJP-led NDA candidates in the assembly election to be held on February 8. At the time of reporting in the evening, none of the BJP bigwigs had personally informed him about his inclusion in the 15-member board of trustees.

“Around seven media persons came to me to have my take on the occasion,” Chaupal said, adding: “I am a widower. My two daughters and one son did call me on my phone. They are very happy at the inclusion of my name in the panel of trustees. Now I am free to work further for the cause of temple and ‘Prabhu Ram’. My children are all married and well settled.”

He was made to quit the VHP and become a member of the BJP in 1991, because the party fielded him to contest the parliamentary election that year which he lost. He lost the election second time in 2014. However, he remained the Rajya Sabha member for two terms – from 2002 to 2014.

The Dalit leader had become a member of the VHP in 1982. He was made its state incharge with headquarters at Gaya in 1989. “It was from Gaya that we volunteers had carried ‘Ram silas’ to Ayodhya,” Chaupal said, adding bricks were taken from every village and each person who gave the brick also gave Rs1.25 as ‘dakshina’ (offering).

The traders even gathered at Puna police station

Surat: Internal dispute between textile traders of Raghuvir Celeum Textile Market that was gutted last month reached a flash point on Tuesday night when two groups nearly came to blows over removing goods from the shops.

A group of textile traders owning shops in the textile market on Puna-Kumbhariya Road on Tuesday night stopped some workers from removing their textile goods from the building and accused them of stealing the stock.

They further alleged that police was helping select traders in shifting their goods. However, the police claimed that they were helping traders remove whatever was left in their shops after proper verification of ownership of goods.

However, a number of textile traders who too own shops in the same textile market alleged that a group of traders were conniving with police to shift their goods from the building that has been sealed by the Surat Urban Development Authority (SUDA).

“We caught two tempos trying to remove goods from the textile market on Tuesday night. But two other trucks managed to escape. Around 70 people were gathering goods from two shops located on the mezzanine and third floor of the market,” said one of the traders Sunil Adukia. “When questioned the workers said that they had police permission to shift the goods. If that is the case, why are we not allowed to take our goods to other places?” asked Adukia.

The traders even gathered at Puna police station to register their protest. However, an official from Puna police said, “There are traders whose two shops are gutted in fire but two more shops are safe and they wanted to shift their goods. We gave them permission on humanitarian grounds. However, when people started removing their goods, some of the traders objected because of internal rivalry.”

Police further said that majority of the traders either don’t have insurance cover for the goods or have documents to prove that amount of goods that own. “Majority of the goods has been purchased without proper billing and insurances. Traders also fear that their good could be stolen by their rivals,” said police.

The bridge will benefit nearly 20 lakh people

Surat: The possibility of early completion of Pal-Umra Tapi bridge project has become real now because Surat Municipal Corporation (SMC) will be soon beginning 24-metre wide road alignment work on 1,800 square metres of ‘occupied piece of land’. SMC has issued work orders for shifting seven of the 20 families residing on this piece of land on Umra side of the bridge. These seven families have agreed to the civic body’s formula and the latter hopes others too would fall in line soon.

The bridge is 95 per cent complete since last 18 months but refusal of these families to shift has been holding up the completion of the Rs81 crore project. The bridge, which will join Pal and Umra areas, will benefit approximately 20 lakh people.

Municipal commissioner Banchhanidhi Pani said on January 27 that a few families cannot hold 20 lakh people to ransom. He said, “We will adopt means available under the law and take possession of the land. Land owners will be given compensation as per the law.”

He had said those willing to cooperate will be covered under the compromise formula approved by the standing committee of the civic body. They will be given plots of land of equal size under their possession together with cumulative construction amount of Rs2.50 crore. Each evacuee family also will be paid monthly rent of Rs12,000 till their new house gets ready.

An officer of the civic body said, “Seven families have come forward to accept our formula. We have issued work orders for them and hope the remaining families too will accept our formula.”

An officer of SMC bridge department said, “This bridge will be beneficial to at least 20 lakh people living on both sides of Umra and Pal areas. At present, a large number of people have to go all the way to Sardar Bridge or cable-stayed bridge to cross over to the other side. The bridge will save people at least 15 minutes of travel time.”

Surat: The Surat Municipal Corporation (SMC) has issued notices to about 23 commercial high-rise buildings located in various municipal zones to make necessary changes in the outer elevation of the buildings confirming to the fire safety standards.

These high-rise buildings have come under the scanner of the SMC after the massive fire gutted Raghuvir Celeum textile market recently. The civic body’s urban development and town planning department has ordered the survey of the commercial buildings for checking the fire safety measures.

Official sources said that the survey will cover more than 1,000 commercial high-rises. The fire officials will be checking the outer elevation at the buildings, entry and exit, parking facilities, entry gates and other fire safety norms including fire hydrant system etc.

The 23 buildings issued notices by the civic body are located in the central zone, Limbayat zone, Udhana zone, Rander and Athwa zones.

Official sources said that the devastating fire at the Raghvir market on Puna-Kumbhariya road on the early hours of January 21 could not be controlled even after 32 hours due to the presence of the outer elevation or facade constructed with aluminium material. The fire gutted more than 600 shops and caused losses to the tune of over Rs 200 crore.

Chief fire officer Basant Pareek said, “A survey of the commercial buildings across the city has been started and we found about 23 buildings having faulty outer elevation. Notices have been issued to the developers for making necessary changes in the outer elevation and conform with the fire safety norms under the National Building Code (NBC).”

Pareek added, “The survey is still going on and that about 1,000 commercial buildings will be covered.”

59,['6/02/2020'],Civic body to move HC against UDHD orders,"This story is from February 6, 2020

PATNA: The Patna Municipal Corporation (PMC) board on Wednesday passed a resolution affirming that daily wage sanitation workers will not be removed from their jobs and that the process of regularisation of Group D employees (working for 10 years) will resume soon.

The board members also decided to move the Patna High Court challenging the three directives issued by the UDHD on January 28, February 3 and February 4, respectively. The decisions were taken at a special board meeting held under the Bihar Municipal Act, 2007 to address the grievances of the sanitation workers, who are on an indefinite strike since Monday.

The move comes a day after Patna Mayor Sita Sahu met the state urban development and housing department (UDHD) minister, Suresh Sharma, to demand that PMC be authorized to make Group-D appointments in the civic body.

“We will file the affidavit on February 6. Meanwhile, we will stick to our decision to regularise workers who completed 10 years of service. At least 112 workers have been regularized and 400 are in the process, which will be completed soon,” the Mayor said, adding, “The PMC will fight against the UDHD’s decision on behalf of the daily wage workers.”

The Mayor, who chaired the meeting, said the PMC board members have rejected the order issued by the UDHD directing that the services of daily-wage sanitation workers be discontinued from March 31 and instead rope in a private agency.

“In the Lokayukta order, there was no mention of removal of daily wage labourers. It only mentions taking services from outsourcing agencies, which the PMC has already been doing,” Sahu said.

She added, “Currently, around 2,200 sanitation workers are employed with the PMC through outsourcing. Around 4,300 are daily wage sanitation workers, while 1,100 are permanent group D employees.”

The Mayor remarked that the UDHD has “misinterpreted” the decision of the Lokayukta and the civic body has been facing the wrath of the sanitation workers because of the department’s fault.

The UDHD in its letter issued on February 3 had asked the municipal body to end the services of the daily wage workers on March 31 and outsource the services to private agencies. On February 4, the department issued another letter stating that daily wage Group D employees will be given priority in selection of sanitation staff by the company to be outsourced.

PMC commissioner Amit Kumar Pandey and ward councillors were present at the special board meeting. Some ward councillors even demanded to terminate the contract of outsourced companies providing sanitation workers, but it was rejected by the PMC board members.

KOLKATA: The KMDA, from February 15, is set to start floating tenders for repairing six flyovers and bridges that underwent structural health audit last year. Starting with Baghajatin rail over bridge (ROB), which the authorities have listed as the top-most priority among the six bridges, the tenders will be floated for work on Kalighat Setu, Sealdah flyover, Aurobindo Setu, Chingrighata flyover and Bankim Setu.

Officials said the reason why it was taking so much of time to float the bridge repair tenders was this was the first time the work was being done with so much attention to detail.

“The plan is to take up repair work without having to shut any flyover. Only a partial closure may be necessary if the situation demands,” said an official.

Repairs on Kalighat Setu will entail fixing the corroded pillars and boosting its load-taking capacity while 10 to 15 bearings of Aurobindo Setu need to be replaced. Additional load and bitumen layer will be removed from Sealdah flyover and Bankim Setu and urgent repair and maintenance work will be carried out on Chingrighata flyover.

PATNA: Police have so far failed to make any breakthrough in the loot of jewellery worth Rs90 lakh from a showroom at Jairam Bazar under Khagaul police station area in western Patna on Tuesday.

Two armed criminals had entered the showroom as customers and took owner Sujeet Kumar hostage at gunpoint before stuffing the jewellery in a bag and escaping on foot. Sujeet was made unconscious by criminals by spraying some anaesthetic agent. They even took away the digital video recorder of CCTV cameras installed inside and outside the shop. According to police, the incident took place between 2 and 3pm and they were informed at 4.42pm. Shop’s shutter was half down when some neighbours peeped inside.

Khagaul police station SHO Mukesh Kumar Mukesh said Sujeet had yet not told police everything. “He unusually opened his shop at 6am on Tuesday against his regular timing of around 10.30am. Someone reached his shop at 8.30am to get a pair of anklets cleaned. Sujeet himself had gone to a nearby shop for anklets cleaning,” he said.

He said Sujeet had received a call from that person to open shop early as he had some urgency. “Sujeet received a similar call again from another unknown person with remarkably same request of cleaning a pair of anklets. After receiving the second call, Sujeet apprehended some trouble and told another shopowner in the neighbourhood about that,” the SHO said.

“Surprisingly, Sujeet is not saying all these things. Instead, he is denying to have received any such call. Police got to know from other persons about the calls during interrogation,” he said.

Mukesh said at least four to five criminals are suspected to be involved in the crime.

Donald Trump

AHMEDABAD: A series of high level meetings between senior police officials of the state took place ahead of the likely visit by US president Donald Trump at the end of this month.

Even as the cops said that formal word confirming Trump’s visit was still awaited, Ahmedabad city is abuzz with preparations for the likely visit. Recently, only CM Vijay Rupani had given a formal word on the issue, saying at his address at a political rally in Delhi that the US president would visit the Sabarmati riverfront in Gujarat soon.

On Wednesday, both the home department and DGP’s office were abuzz with a series of meeting between senior police and government officials. Top sources said that no US security agency has come to Gujarat as yet. “They will only come when Trump’s visit is confirmed officially” added a senior police official.

Even as official word in writing is awaited, cops are gearing up for the VVIP visit. “As far as the police is concerned, we are preparing ourselves to be fully ready for the visit of any VVIP. We are in touch with the stadium authorities as well as the officials of the construction company to know the date on which they will be able to hand over the stadium for a thorough check up to the police,” a top police official said.

Top police source said a helipad is expected to come up near the practice pitches of Ground B at the Sardar Patel Motera Stadium. “We have our men deployed discreetly near the stadium as part of our security drill. It is believed that if US president Trump’s visit to Gujarat is confirmed, senior police officials from across the state could be called in for security duty,” a top police official said.

AHMEDABAD: Two major access roads to the world’s largest cricket stadium at Motera is almost ready. One of these roads, which originates a little ahead of Indira Bridge in the Gandhinagar state highway near Bhat village will directly lead to the new Gate 3 of the stadium. The 24-metre wide road will be ready by February 10 ahead of US president Donald Trump’s visit later this month.

The major road touches the Gandhinagar state highway ahead of Indira bridge and turns near Koteshwar towards Dev Pride Society and then leads directly to Gate 3. The other road originates from Dev Pride and joins the Hotel Janpath Road along the metro rail route.

When TOI visited the site, about 150 metres of the road’s last stretch was left. Street lights have been erected while construction of new footpaths along both arms of the 24-metre-wide road is almost over.

“Nearly 13 of the 16 road stretches that are part of the access routes to Motera stadium have been refurbished,” says an AMC official present on site. “Work has been taking place at breakneck speeds as a number of access routes are important to prevent traffic jams,” says the official. At several places in Motera area even the drainage systems have been cleaned and spruced up ahead of the visit. Tight security is being maintained around 1km radius of the stadium.

65,['6/02/2020'],Patna stinks as sanitation workers’ strike continues,"This story is from February 6, 2020

In just two days, the city has turned into a dumping ground

PATNA: The sanitation workers’ strike continued for the third consecutive day, leaving heaps of garbage on the streets and lanes of the state capital on Wednesday.

The Group D sanitation employees of Patna Municipal Corporation (PMC) have been on strike demanding revoking of the urban development and housing department (UDHD) order to do away with the daily wage workers of PMC and outsource the sanitation work to a company after March 31.

The protesters burned tyres and blocked the road near Kankarbagh, Patliputra and Patna City circle offices. Heaps of garbage could be seen lying in most of the areas in the city. Residents were also seen burning the garbage, which is prohibited under Solid Waste Management Act.

Aniket, a resident of Anandpuri, complained that the roads are littered with garbage with animal carcasses also thrown by the protesters in some areas. “We are forced to dump garbage on the road since no one is collecting it,” he said.

Sheetal Kumari of Bhootnath Road said the animal carcasses and garbage dumped on the streets by protesters is stinking and it’s unbearable to even walk on such streets. “The carcasses of three dogs have been lying near Sabzi Mandi for the last couple of days and stinking. It is difficult to purchase even vegetable from the market,” she said.

A bank employee, Kundan Sharma, said the dustbin outside her office was also overflowing with garbage and the stink was unbearable. “There is not a single clean road in the city at present. The civic body should have a backup plan to handle such situation,” he said.

“In just two days, the city has turned into a dumping ground. I wonder how long it will take to clean the roads,” said Rashmi Ahuja, a resident of Musallahpur.

A sanitation worker, Ram Kumar, said, “We don’t want to create inconvenience to the residents but we are helpless. We are fighting for our rights.”

Patna Nagar Nigam Staff Union president Chandra Prakash said, “Our protest will continue. As soon as the PMC files an affidavit, we will hold a meeting and take the final decision on the ongoing strike.”

Indradeep Chandravanshi, a member of empowered standing committee and councillor of ward number 48 called the UDHD decision a ‘Tughlaqi Farman’. “The Lokayukta should also know how the department created havoc by misinterpreting his directives,” he said after the special board meeting of PMC on Wednesday.

“After June 26, 2018, no sanitation staff has been recruited by the PMC on daily wage. In the same year, the state government asked the municipal bodies to avail the services of sanitation workers through outsourcing. The PMC followed this directive and outsourced four companies,” Indradeep said.

PATNA: The outbreak of novel coronavirus (CoV) in China has partially hit tourism sector in Bihar, especially at Bodh Gaya and Nalanda where Chinese Buddhist pilgrims and tourists from Thailand, Hong Kong and Vietnam visit in large numbers.State tourism department officials, however, said the overall tourist footfalls have not dropped much. Buddhists and people from all walks of life from across the world visit Bodh Gaya, which is considered the seat of enlightenment of Lord Buddha.Though December to February period is considered to be peak tourist season at Bodh Gaya, officials and hospitality sector experts said the footfalls have been comparatively less so far this time.Suryaketu Das, an official at tourist information centre of Bihar State Tourism Development Corporation (BSTDC) at Bodh Gaya, said: “The festive season at Bodh Gaya begins in September and reaches its peak in January-February. A large number of Chinese pilgrims visit different monasteries and the Mahabodhi Temple every year during this time. This year, pilgrims from China haven’t arrived following restrictions due to spread of coronavirus. Nevertheless, there hasn’t been much impact on tourists arrival from other countries.”A member of Bodh Gaya Temple Management Committee (BTMC) said medical teams have been deputed at the temple for check-up of every visitor. “Tourists from China, Singapore and Vietnam, who arrived at Bodh Gaya after January 15, have undergone various tests. The medical team keeps a regular check on them,” he said.Arun Kumar Ojha, member of Bodh Gaya Hotelier Association, said: “More than 500 Chinese tourists arrive at Bodh Gaya in February. But this time we are not expecting any visitor from China.”Sharing similar views, KN Jha, manager of a luxurious hotel at Rajgir, said Chinese tourists contribute to around 40%-45% of the total bookings during this season. “Since, they have been restricted from coming to India, a major part of tourism sector has been affected. The tourists made last-minute cancellation of their bookings at various hotels in Rajgir,” he said and added: “The coronavirus has also affected tourists from countries like Myanmar and Japan. At least 10% of the tourists coming from these countries have cancelled their bookings.”State surveillance officer Dr Ragani Mishra, who visited Gaya airport on Wednesday, said the outbreak hasn’t impacted tourism much as tourists from countries like Thailand are reaching there in huge numbers. “Authorities at Gaya airport are keeping a check on international tourists. From filling forms to thermal screening, several measures have been taken by the state health department to protect people from any infection. Besides, an emergency phone number has also been given to them in case they get any symptoms of coronavirus,” she said.Meanwhile, a Supaul resident, who returned from Nepal on Wednesday, was kept under observation at his home. “We have sent his sample to National Institute of Virology (NIV) at Pune. As of now, he has been kept in isolation at his home in Supaul,” said Mishra.Rajiv Sharma, an official at BSTDC’s tourist information centre in Rajgir said: “The outbreak hasn’t affected the inflow of international tourists, except from China.”",patna,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73973152,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-450700,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/coronavirus-partially-affects-tourism-in-bihar/articleshow/73967802.cms

Kanhaiya Kumar

PATNA: Former JNU Students’ Union president Kanhaiya Kumar ’s convoy was attacked allegedly by CAA/NRC supporters at Mallik Chowk under Sadar police station area in Supaul town on Wednesday evening.

He was on way to address an anti-CAA/NRC meeting at Sisauni under Kishanpur police station area in the district before going to Saharsa. Kanhaiya has launched his yatra against CAA from Bhitiharwa Ashram in East Champaran on January 30. The yatra will culminate at Patna Gandhi Maidan on February 29.

Sadar police station SHO Sandeep Kumar Singh said Kanhaiya’s convoy slowed down due to heavy crowd in the busy market when some locals, who were said to be pro-CAA/NRC, started raising slogans against the CPI leader. However, police ensured that the convoy moved forward safely,” he said, adding that Kanhaiya wanted to divert route to address a meeting at a nearby place. But he was denied as he had no prior permission to address any gathering there.

The SHO said when almost all the cars in his convoy passed, someone threw stones on a pickup van with banner of anti-CAA/NRC slogans. Singh said there were at least 13 cars and more than 40 bikes in Kanahiya’s convoy. “The windshield of the van was shattered and the driver was injured. The convoy was later escorted up to the border of Saharsa district,” he said, adding no written complaint had been received by police.

Sushil Modi

PATNA: In a first-of-its-kind initiative in the country, the state government will table a ‘ Green Budget ’ in the legislative assembly on March 15 after the general budget, which would be present on February 25 by deputy CM and finance minister Sushil Modi .

“In the green budget, the finance minister would present the gross allocation to be spent by various departments on environment conservation measures to be taken in the 2020-21 fiscal,” finance department principal secretary S Siddharth said on Wednesday.

Siddharth added, “Green budget implies that the budgeted money would be spent by various departments for the restoration of degraded ecological systems in the state and conservation of the existing ones so that the restoration of the ecological system, including its bio-diversity, is achieved over time. The aim is to improve the living conditions of human beings as well as wild life.”

Siddharth was addressing a workshop organized by the Asian Development Research Institute (ADRI) at the Old\Main secretariat. Representatives of various departments, including the principal accountant general of the accountant general’s office Nilotpal Goswami, were present.

The nodal officer for the green budget, Sanjeev Mittal, said it would be tabled in the assembly along with gender and child budgets on March 15. An overview of the expenditures made on environmental conservation activities during 2019-20 financial year would also be included in it.

“The expenditures made on environment conservation measures would be considered as positive steps taken. After a couple of years, the evaluation of the steps taken would be done,” Mittal added.

Mittal said the green budget would be prepared by separating the budgetary allotments made by various departments for environmental conservation and then the proposed expenditures would be aggregated to give shape to the green budget.

The budget would have two components —expenditures to be incurred on physical restoration of environmental degradation and non-physical investments (like publicity drives, public awareness and inclusion of environmental studies in school curriculum among others).

ADRI director P P Ghosh said, “The focus area of the green budget would be issues related to climate change, bio-diversity, restoration of natural resources and eco-system, as well as on environmental conservation and pollution control — all aimed at improving living conditions of people. It has been conceived in the backdrop of the Jal-Jeevan-Hariyali campaign.”

Two experts, who made key presentations on the occasion, included Rita Pandey, senior fellow of the National Institute of Public Finance (NIFP) and Shailly Kedia, fellow of The Energy Research Institute (TERI). “The two experts have made the environmental policy framework for Karnataka and Punjab,” Ghosh said, adding, other presentations were made by Niladri Dhar and Vivek Tejashwi.

69,['6/02/2020'],Bihar: 2 foot overbridges on New Bypass Road soon,"This story is from February 6, 2020

Representative image

PATNA: Patna divisional commissioner Sanjay Kumar Agarwal has claimed that the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) has proposed to construct two foot overbridges (FoB) at strategic locations on NH-30, commonly known as the New Bypass Road . The stretch of NH-30 between Anisabad and Zero Mile witnesses regular snarls, owing to movement of heavy vehicles throughout the day.

“The New Bypass Road is one of the most crowded roads in the city. We have observed that pedestrians face a lot of difficulties while crossing the road. Keeping their safety in mind, the NHAI will construct two FoBs at the busiest locations on the stretch,” Agarwal told this newspaper.

He added that instructions had also been given for the maintenance of underpasses on the stretch. “There are several underpasses on the stretch that are not being used due to lack of maintenance. Pedestrians will not have any problem in walking on the road once the underpasses are cleaned.”

Agarwal, who is also the managing director of the Bihar State Road Development Corporation Limited (BSRDCL), claimed that the New Bypass Road was one of the most accident-prone areas in the city.

“According to a survey, this road has been identified as a black spot because several accidents have occurred here. It is under surveillance and many unauthorized cuts have been removed from the road to ensure the safety of people,” he said.

Patna district magistrate Kumar Ravi also issued several instructions on Tuesday to reduce traffic congestion on the New Bypass Road . He asked the ADM (law and order) to clean the underpasses on NH-30.

With the construction of FoBs and maintenance of the underpasses, residents of localities like Ram Krishna Nagar and Anisabad now hope to get respite from the frequent snarls.

“The movement of vehicles on the New Bypass Road is more dangerous than the traffic snarls. I always avoid commuting on the stretch at night as it is really unsafe,” said Anisabad resident Sakshi Sinha.

“Crossing the New Bypass Road is very risky as there is continuous movement of trucks and buses there. Moreover, the vehicles move at a very high speed. I will be grateful to the authorities if they take measures to ensure pedestrian safety,” said Shivam Trivedi, another resident of Anisabad.

Lately, the state government has taken several measures to provide safe pedestrian movement. The city will soon get foot overbridges at Rupaspur, Rajendra Nagar and in front of Patna zoo and two underpass escalators near Samrat Ashoka International Convention Centre.

PATNA: With a view to fulfilling their nutritional needs, the winged inmates of the Sanjay Gandhi Biological Park, commonly known as the Patna zoo , are now being fed with mealworms. These live feeds, which include superworms and other types of insects, are also being cultivated on the premises of the zoo.

According to zoo director Amit Kumar, around 50 worms are kept in bird feeders every day. “The mealworms, which are being provided to pheasants and macaws as special supplements, help fulfil their nutritional needs and keep them warm. They will soon be added to the diet of other birds as well,” he told this newspaper on Wednesday.

The Patna zoo has several varieties of pheasants, including the Lady Amherst’s pheasant and the Yellow Golden pheasant.

Talking about the cultivation of worms, Amit said, “The eggs hatched by insects become larvae in three days, which in turn become pupae in almost a week and are kept in separate boxes. The pupae take three days to become mealworms. The male adults survive for two weeks and the females for four to five weeks.”

The veterinary doctors at the zoo monitor the life cycle of the insects. “Mealworms do not drink water as they absorb it from different food sources, which we provide at the zoo,” Amit said and added that approximately 125 larvae had been purchased from an online portal and over 5,000 larvae cultivated in just a couple of months.

A worm farmer pointed out that larvae, pupae, beetles, mini, moulted and large worms were kept in separate boxes, while the mature insects were kept in different trays to increase the production.

PATNA: In an attempt to keep the premises of railway stations clean, the East Central Railway (ECR) has signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with a Mumbai-based firm that uses crushed plastic bottles for manufacturing garments.

According to ECR’s chief public relations officer (CPRO) Rajesh Kumar, bottle crushing machines worth Rs 5 lakh each have been installed at the Patna Junction, Rajendra Nagar Terminal, Danapur, Patna Sahib, Pt Deendayal Upadhyay Junction, Dhanbad, Muzaffarpur, Samastipur, Darbhanga, Jayanagar, Bapudham Motihari, Madhubani, Saharsa, Raxaul, Sitamarhi and Sugauli stations.

“As part of this pilot project of the railways, the firm will collect crushed plastic bottles from different stations of the ECR and make yarns, which will be used to manufacture T-shirts and caps of fine quality. One tonne of crushed bottle materials will help produce at least 10,000 T-shirts,” the CPRO said, adding that the railways had displayed samples of T-shirts made of crushed plastic bottles at the Danapur station.

Each T-shirt costs around Rs 350 and can be worn in any season. “We will ensure that these reasonable T-shirts are available at all major stations so that even railway employees can buy them easily,” Kumar said.

Scientist and Munger University vice-chancellor Ranjit Kumar Verma hailed the “eco-friendly initiative” of the railways. He said, “The railways has shown us that single-use plastic, which has been banned all over, can be put to other uses. All government and private agencies should follow in the footsteps of the railways.”

Sources claimed that the state government had also decided to use crushed plastic materials for construction of roads.

PATNA: Bihar BJP leaders hailed the formation of a trust for building Ram Mandir at Ayodhya. Union minister and Begusarai MP Giriraj Singh said the sacrifice of “martyrs” is bearing fruits now.

“Congress used to mock us when we used to raise the slogan of ‘Mandir wahin banayenge’ (we will construct the temple at the same spot). They used to ask us for the date of temple construction. Now the dates have been announced and ‘Sri Ram Janambhoomi Tirath Kshetra’ trust has also been formed. Now, there will be a grand temple of Lord Ram at Ayodhya,” Giriraj said.

BJP state president Sanjay Jaiswal said while the entire country is in festive mood with the PM Modi’s announcement, Congress is in shock. “Congress kept the matter hanging and delayed the construction of Ram temple at Ayodhya for years. Now it is obvious for them to be upset,” Jaiswal said.

Union minister of state for home affairs Nityanand Rai also hailed the announcement. “This government has proved that it does not believe only in making shallow promises but actually executes them in letter and spirit,” he said.

Bihar Congress functionaries, on the other hand, accused BJP of taking political mileage as the issue has been looked after by the apex court. “Modi government is only executing the Supreme Court judgment. Besides, the way announcement regarding the trust has been made close to Delhi assembly elections shows that BJP is aiming at polarization of votes through this move. They have always tried to deviate people’s attention from serious issues like economic slowdown,” Bihar Congress’s working president Kaukab Quadri said.

Nails or such metal objects cause heavy damage to the trees as the bark is the skin of the tree which is alive

Surat: The garden department of Surat Municipal Corporation (SMC) has issued notices on Wednesday to some of the private institutions and advertisers for pinning posters and signboards on the trees.

The SMC’s garden department came into action after a citizen complained on Wednesday about dozens of trees being hurt with nails in the posh Jamnanagar area on Ghod Dod road by some private institutions and advertisers. Acting on his complaint, the garden department officials carried out inspection of the area and issued notices to the parties concerned.

Official sources said that the garden department had even earlier launched campaigns to remove illegal advertisements from the trees in the city. Advertisers are seen mainly choosing trees located on the main thoroughfares to put up their displays. They use nails to pierce the tree barks and hang their boards or flex advertisements.

Talking to TOI, SMC’s garden superintendent, SJ Gautam said, “We have been carrying out campaigns on a regular basis to protect the trees across the city. We have even issued notices to the private institutions and advertisers who put up advertisements and sign-boards damaging the trees.”

Gautam further said that the act of damaging trees falls under the damage to public property Act. “Despite our efforts to stop the menace, people are still indulging in the illegal act,” he rued.

Environment activist and tree expert, Darshan Desai told TOI, “Nails or such metal objects cause heavy damage to the trees as the bark is the skin of the tree which is alive.

76,['6/02/2020'],Three injured as cooking gas cylinder explodes in Vesu,"This story is from February 6, 2020

The blast might have occurred due to leakage in the cylinder

Surat: Three persons , including a woman , suffered burn injuries in a fire that broke out after a 5kg cooking gas cylinder exploded in Vesu areas of the city on Wednesday. Three children aged 8-10 years, escaped without injuries in the incident. Fire officials said that the blast may have occurred because of leakage in the cylinder.

The explosion took place in the house of Pravin Shah (42), who lives with his wife Jyotsna and three children — daughter Sona and two sons Ansu and Sohan in SUDA Awas flat A6 near S D Jain College. Shah, who does tailoring work for a living, lives in a one-room-kitchen flat.

On Wednesday morning, when Jyotsna ignited the gas stove to make tea the 5 kg gas cylinder exploded and fire engulfed the flat instantly.

Shah’s neighbour Vinod Goswami (42) rushed to douse the fire and suffered burn injuries along with Shah and Jyotsna. All three were rushed to New civil Hospital (NCH). The three children miraculously escaped without any injury.

An official from fire department, Maruti Sonwane said, “Shah suffered 40% burns whereas Jyotsna received 20% burn injuries on her body. However, Goswami’s condition was critical as he suffered maximum 80% burns.”

Sonwane said that the explosion could have been because of leakage in the gas cylinder. “Due to winter, family had kept the windows closed and hence the leaked gas could not escape which aggravated the situation,” he added.

77,['6/02/2020'],Vegetable cooperatives help boost tribal farmers’ income by 20%,"This story is from February 6, 2020

In Umarpada alone more than 2,000 farmers have sold over 185 metric tonnes of vegetables

Surat: Tribals in Surat district growing vegetables for a living will now be able to earn at least 20% more income with the elimination of middlemen. This has become possible through a pilot project of farmers’ vegetable cooperative on lines of the milk cooperatives functional under Gujarat Cooperative Milk Marketing Federation (GCMMF).

Under the project the forest department has started grading and collection centres for procurement of vegetables through tribal farmers’ union and joint farmers management committees.

The pilot project has been funded by the rural development agencies under Dr Shaymaprasad Mukherjee Rurban Mission.

The grading and collection centres have been set up in Umarpada, Umarogt, Pinpar, Ghanavad and Govat villages of Umrapada taluka in Surat district.

While the Umarpada center became operational in first week of December 2019, other centres will start functioning by end of February.

Surat deputy conservator of forest, Puneet Nayyar said, “The model is based on milk cooperatives, where farmers from remote areas can sell their produce locally without travelling much. This process eliminates the middlemen and the payment is also made directly to the farmer.”

In the past two months, we have seen farmers’ income go up by at least 20% under this pilot project and they also do not have to worry about the sale of their produce, he added.

At Umarpada alone in last two months, more than 2,000 farmers have sold over 185 metric tonnes (MT) vegetables worth Rs 57 lakh. The major sales came from paddy, papdi (field beans), tur, methi (fenugreek) and dhana (coriander seeds).

The Surat forest department has formed joint forest management committees in the villages and its members sell their produce at the collection centres, which has a tie up with South Gujarat Tribal Farmers’ Productivity Union (SGTFPU) for procurement.

Members get paid for their vegetables based on its grading and quality. The amount is credited in bank accounts within 10 days.

78,['6/02/2020'],Villagers protest handing over of temple room to private trust,"This story is from February 6, 2020

Surat: People in the tribal-dominated Dharampur town in Valsad have threatened to launch agitation against the administration for allegedly handing over a portion of the historic Kala Ramji temple to a religious trust.

Villagers stated the temple is 150 years old and it was built during the rule of kings of Dharampur. After Independence, Dharampur was acceded to the Indian union and that the houses and temples built by the kings came under the direct purview of the government.

Former president of Dharampur municipality, Kalpesh Kapadia told TOI: “This is a historic temple of Lord Rama and our religious feelings are attached with this temples from decades. We have learnt that the government trust of the temple is planning to hand over a house in the premises to some religious trust.”

Kapadia added, “We have demanded that the house, which was locked for all these years, should be handed to the temple for carrying out religious activities. It is unfair to let out the house to some other trust and hurt the religious feelings of the villagers.”

Kapadia said that on Thursday the villagers will be submitting a memorandum to the Dharampur mamlatdar, who is the head of the temple trust.

Temple priest of Kala Ramji temple, Jaydeep Dave said, “The house in the temple premise was given to a government officer, but it was shut for the last many years. Few days ago, the house was opened and some people were busy cleaning up the room. On inquiring, they said they were from a religious trust and the house had been handed over to them. The villagers are angry over this move and they are planning to agitate”

When contacted, mamlatdar of Dharampur, HA Patel said, “I am away for an official training programme. I will be able to give the details after few days.”

Surat: Representatives of farmers and cooperative sector have threatened to launch an agitation against the authorities of the Bhatia toll plaza alleging that they are not providing an extra cash lane that could smoothen the passage of vehicles registered in Surat city and district.

A meeting in this connection was held in Itarwa village in Palsana taluka on Wednesday where the leaders stated that the vehicles registered in the city and district have to wait for their turn in the long serpentine queue at the single cash lane for paying the toll tax. Several representations in this regard have fallen on deaf ears.

Darshan Naik, a member of Surat district panchayat, said, “Vehicles registered in city and district have to pay Rs 20 as one-way tax at Bhatia toll plaza. For this, single cash lane is made operational. Daily more than 10,000 vehicles from the city and district use this toll plaza, resulting in huge traffic jams at the cash lane”

Naik added, “We are demanding that the toll authorities must set-up an extra cash lane to ease the long queues or the vehicles should be allowed to pass through the FASTag lanes by deducting Rs 20 as one-way tax.”

President of Parivartan Trust, Jitu Patel said, “All we want is the easy passage of the vehicles. At present, people have to wait in the serpentine queue for more than an hour”

Mohan Bhatia, cooperative leader said, “It was due to the agitation that the local vehicles were allowed free passage at the Kamrej toll plaza after the FASTag rule was implemented. If the Bhatia toll plaza authorities don’t increase cash lanes, we will have to launch similar stir.”

Chennai: As the consequential impact of lockdown of three China factories by Korean parent due to the Corona virus outbreak, Hyundai Motor India Ltd., has alerted its dealers of possible impact on vehicle deliveries.

Hyundai Motor Corporation, Korea late on Tuesday night announced that it was suspending operations at three plants in China due to parts shortage.

The suspension of production could be nearly a week, international news wires reported. The Korean chaebol’s Indian arm Hyundai Motor India sources a very small portion of parts for its production facilities in Sriperumbudur near Chennai from Korea, which in turn sources them from China.

Sales teams officials have sent out messages to dealers asking them to place orders for vehicles earlier so that there are no shortages. “HMI factory is monitoring and checking the possibility of parts supply from China. However not sure,” the communication accessed by TOI said. “Do not feel that we are pushing for orders,” the communication read.

A Hyundai India spokesperson denied any such communications were sent and that there were no issues in relation to production. “I can assure you that there is no impact on our production schedule as of now,” the spokesperson said.

While most of Hyundai’s operations in India are localised from components standpoint, some parts do come from Korea and other global sources.

“Sadly, you cannot roll out the car without that small part which is still imported. We do not have issues for now, but if the lockdown in China continues, not just us, but the entire auto market will feel the heat,” an official at the factory said, citing anonymity. “Don’t forget, China is the global manufacturing hub for parts and components and shifting supplier is not an easy task.”

IIIT is presently functioning from SVNIT campus

SURAT: If things move in the expected direction , Surat will host state’s first Indian Institute of Information and Technology (IIIT) in Kamrej , within a couple of years.

The state government has already allotted 28 acres of land to develop a campus at around Rs 128 crore in Kamrej. According to the collector office sources, the land is dispute-free and can be handed over immediately once the state government completes the formality.

“We have already been allotted 28 acre land and are hopeful that within next two years the institute will start taking shape on the new campus. The procedure to hand over the land is at the final stage,” said J S Bhatt, director of IIIT, Surat.

“Collector office had proposed in government for approval to hand over the land for IIIT few months ago. But we are yet to receive the order. The land is clear and without any disputes,” said Daval Patel, district collector.

Officials in collector office and IIIT informed that they visited the land and there are no encroachments or pending legal issues. “Once the land is allotted, designing and approval will take a few months’ time. The construction can start only after that. We are estimating the cost to be around Rs 128 crore,” said Bhatt.

Currently the IIIT is operating from SVNIT and it offers four-year Bachelor of Technology degree in two branches — computer science and electronics and communication. Each branch has 60 students each and the first batch is in the third year currently. At present over 300 students of IIIT are studying in Sardar Vallabhbhai National Institute of Technology (SVNIT).

83,['6/02/2020'],Only five per cent of police stations in Bihar connected to crime and criminal tracking network,"This story is from February 6, 2020

Representative image

PATNA: The state government has once again extended the deadline for completion of central government’s Crime and Criminal Tracking Network and System (CCTNS) till October this year.

PM Narendra Modi had sought details of the CCTNS status in Bihar from chief secretary Deepak Kumar , additional chief secretary (home) Amir Subhani and other senior officers during his periodic videoconferencing held in the second last week of January, sources said.

Only 61 police stations — 36 in Patna and 25 in Nalanda — have been brought under CCTNS till date against the total number of 894 police stations and 380 higher police offices in the state. This amount to even less than 5% of total locations where CCTNS is to be implemented.

Tender for implementing the project was floated four times. It was on the fifth occasion that TCS signed an agreement with Bihar police in September 2018 with a time period of 55 weeks to complete the project. However, it failed to meet the deadline.

In 2012, too, state police had entered into agreement with another private firm but due to poor work progress, the contract was terminated in 2014.

The ambitious project was launched nationwide after the 26/11 terror attack in Mumbai. Under this project, all police stations across country would get connected with digital network and integrated with prisons, courts and forensic laboratories through Interoperable Criminal Justice System (ICJS).

The process of lodging FIR, station diary entry, filing of chargesheet and other manual works at police stations would be performed digitally.

When contacted, State Crime Records Bureau (SCRB) IG Kamal Kishore Singh said the deadline could not be met due to several reasons. “PM has been informed about the new deadline of October 2020. At 61 police stations, CCTNS is functional but manual work is also going on until things stabilize,” he said.

On October 25 last year, Singh had told TOI that implementation of CCTNS was at a very advanced stage in state and it would be done across Bihar by December 2019. “The 61 police stations where CCTNS has become functional have been connected to state data centre (SDC). Required hardware has been delivered to 513 police stations and all higher police offices. Procurement process is on for 381 police stations. All delivery and commissioning is to be completed by March 31,” Singh said.

He also said Bihar Police Building Construction Corporation has been given March 31 deadline for preparing sites at 381 police stations for hardware installation. “Internet connection of 2mbps via second version of Bihar State Wide Area Network (BSWAN) of BELTRON has been given to 661 police stations. Rest required connectivity completion deadline is also March 31,” he said.

Singh said work for digitalization of ten years’ data (legacy data) at police stations has started in eight districts. “It would soon start in the remaining districts. This step would be completed by October,” he said.

The IG said hardware for installing state’s disaster recovery centre (DRC) has been sent to National Data Centre (NDC) at Bhubaneswar and it would be completed in a month. “Police stations would be connected to SDC which would have backup data at RDC and would be further connected to NDC,” he said.

PATNA: A 50-year-old person died as his country-made pistol went off during the marriage ceremony of his niece at Markama village under Sikandara police station area in Jamui district on Tuesday night.

The deceased, identified as Mahfooz Miyan , had come from Kolkata to attend his niece’s wedding. He was a native of Roh village in Nawada district but had shifted to Kolkata around five years ago.

Sikandara police station SHO Raj Vardhan Kumar said Mahfooz had a gunshot injury in lower part of his abdomen. “The place of injury suggests that he had a country-made pistol which went off,” he said, adding that one empty cartridge was recovered from the spot. He said the incident took place around 4pm and police was informed around 6pm.

He said Mahfooz’s relative Mohammad Javed lodged an FIR on Wednesday against two named and other unknown persons alleging that they came and killed him during marriage. “But no one in the village told the police that who killed Mahfooz. Generally anger is reflected among people or relative of a murdered person and they tell everything to police in such situation. But there was nothing like that in the village,” he said, adding police suspect that Mahfooz got killed in accidental firing by himself.

The SHO said Mahfooz was initially rushed to Sadar hospital from where he was referred to PMCH. “The injured person was on the way to Patna in an ambulance when he succumbed to his injuries while crossing Barbigha in Sheikhpura,” SHO Kumar said, adding police received information about his death around 11pm on Tuesday.

The SHO said that body was handed over to family after conducting post mortem on Wednesday. “Further investigation were going on in connection with the incident,” he said.

85,['6/02/2020'],Park Circus protest completes a month,"This story is from February 6, 2020

Women protesters being felicitated at Park Circus on Wednesday

KOLKATA: The Park Circus sit-in against NRC, NPR and CAA , spearheaded by women, marked its 30th day on Wednesday. The protest, which started on January 7, is going strong despite the death of one of the protesters due to a heart attack and continuous mud-slinging from BJP leaders. Braving the cold and breaking taboos, burqa-clad women, mostly mothers and grandmothers, have been fighting with resilience and determination to save the Constitution. They have pledged to continue their protest till the new citizenship law is revoked. On Wednesday, the organizers, mostly men, felicitated the women protesters with flowers for their courage and resolve to fight for the future of the country.

Inspired by Shaheen Bagh of Delhi, more than 200 women, a lot of them with children in tow, have been participating in the demonstration every day, holding placards of Ambedkar, Gandhi, Bhagat Singh and chanting slogans of ‘Azaadi’, ‘Halla Bol’, and ‘Inquilab Zindabad’. Many feel that this women-led protest will be etched in history as one of its kind.

Nousheen Baba Khan, a PhD scholar who has been a regular protester, said, “A large number of Muslim women at Park Circus have come out in what is considered a male-dominated space and made it their own. They have defied societal pressure and reclaimed the public sphere, which has led to a change in perceptions and stereotypes built around Muslim women.”

Halima Firdausi, a political science student of Rani Birla Girls’ College and a regular at the site, felt that this movement has been a life lesson. This was the first time that she came out to lead a group of men and women with slogans. “I am shy, but this protest made me explore myself. It has empowered me as a woman and has given me confidence to face challenges in life. It is high time that Muslim women’s voices and perspectives are given due consideration since this movement has shattered patriarchal norms,” she said.

Rafiqua, a graduate, echoed Firdausi’s thoughts. According to her, women are not vulnerable and this movement has made that very clear. “We can stand up for our rights and this fight against the draconian act will be made stronger in the coming days,” she said. Rafiqua learnt how to give slogans by observing the students of Jadavpur University and Presidency University at Park Circus and now shouts slogans regularly to keep the morale high.

Asmat Jamil, a kidney transplant patient and the woman who started this protest, said, “The women sitting here are mostly homemakers and have never come out in the open to protest. But this government’s move has forced us to hit the streets. Nothing can deter us and we will continue this movement till the Act is revoked,” said Jamil. She refered to the protester who died of a heart attack at the protest site a few days ago and said, “We are unbent and unbroken and will not let Sameeda Khatoon’s sacrifice go waste.”

Park Circus has inspired many such sit-ins led by women in different pockets of the city, like Kidderpore , Metiabruz and Zakaria Street. Students, activists and common people turn up in huge numbers every day, showing solidarity to the movement. They perform dramas, sing or speak on relevant social issues and human rights to motivate the women. A reading corner has been set up in Park Circus to keep the protesters engaged in some fruitful activity throughout the day.

86,['6/02/2020'],West Bengal: Trucks choke stretches around Tallah Bridge after 10pm; detours peeve drivers,"Trucks clog BT Road on Wednesday night

KOLKATA: It is not just day-time snarls that have made commuting troublesome since Tallah Bridge was shut from Friday night. Night-time traffic jams caused primarily by long queues of parked trucks have now made returning home after 10pm a harrowing experience for the public.The root of the problem lies in light vehicles and two-wheelers that have been plying along Tallah Bridge. Trucks and buses have been barred from taking the bridge since last September to reduce load till the bridge is repaired. Now that the bridge is about to be pulled down, the light vehicles have been forced to take alternative routes. Though the increasing pressure on these roads is palpable even during the day, it becomes unbearable at night when Kolkata-bound trucks start plying. For instance, goods vehicles that enter the city from Bagbazar clog the stretch from Lockgate flyover to Chiria More.Goods vehicles that enter from Cossipore are now being routed from Gopal Thakur Road to Alambazar in Baranagar and then on to Dunlop bridge. These trucks and other goods carriers are then made to take a U-turn from the area in front of the fire station near Dunlop bridge. From there, they head to Nivedita Setu , Kona Expressway and then re-enter the city along the second Hooghly bridge.Om Sahu, a truck driver, complained, “I was on my way to Koley Market from Cossipore with vegetables. Now they have asked me to take the Nivedita Setu-second Hooghly bridge route to Koley Market. This will make it very difficult to keep the perishables fresh.”This problem, a senior police officer said, will only cease once the level crossing at Chitpore is complete. “The primary problem which is causing this snarl is the detour for Kolkata-bound trucks,” an officer said. The state government has already paid the Railways Rs 14 crore for the crossing. Police had also flagged this concern to the state and railway authorities several times.Yet another route for trucks is from Dum Dum to Chiria More, from where they head to BT Road and then on to Dunlop bridge, which has been witnessing long snarls from just past midnight on Friday, when Tallah Bridge was closed to traffic. Most trucks clogging Dunlop bridge and BT Road are those that enter the city from Jessore Road. This snarl severely inconveniences commuters heading to Dakshineswar from the city.",kolkata,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73978173,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-581027,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/trucks-choke-stretches-around-tallah-after-10pm-detours-peeve-drivers/articleshow/73969741.cms

Watering holes in Chennai have begun hosting working nomads by offering swanky co-working spaces and wi-fi per... Read More

CHENNAI: With the co-working boom in the city hitting a new high, pubs too are getting into the spirit of the game. On Sunday, for instance, pub and café ‘Mount Road Social’ will launch its first outlet in Chennai, and while workstations and white boards are in the masterplan, beer and cocktails too are on the menu.

We wanted to create a space where millennials can work, connect as well as order a drink and listen to good music, says CEO Riyaaz Amlani, who adds that it is the company’s 27th outlet in the country. Social, which has a 1,000sqft co-working space attached to it, functions weekdays between 9am and 6pm, but returns to being a bar at night. Social, he adds, prices the co-working space at Rs 5,000 a month, redeemable against food and drinks.

“Chennai has changed a lot in the past couple of years. People here are no longer conservative in their idea of what a workspace is supposed to look or feel like,” says Amlani, who plans to set up four outlets in the city in the next three years. “Now people are open to the idea of work and play.”

City pub Off The Record (OTR) has also thrown itself into the mix. The two-year-old pub recently began giving out its space to people who are working nomads. “We let it out as a co-working space between noon and 6pm at no extra charge. The music is turned off, wi-fi is free and we have people working out of here. It started small but now word has spread,” says Dennis Arasu of OTR. “We find that it is a good way to generate additional revenue because we wouldn’t normally get customers at this time. People seem to like to have a drink and work.”

City-based entrepreneur Vikram Chandrasekar, who for 12 years worked out of the confines of an office cubicle, says ever since he switched to using coffee shops and co-working spaces as his “office”, it has opened windows of opportunity. “Just being in a space that is not sterile or confined, where you can meet new people, changes the way you function. I’ve met people in coffee shops and founded businesses over that one-chance meeting,” says Chandrasekar, who is now into content production. “Adding a pub into the co-working space is a great idea.”

According to research by real estate and investment management firm Jones Lang LaSalle (JLL), the country has a freelance workforce of more than 15 million professionals, which means there is a demand for more than 4 million seats. Their report predicts that the total space leased by co-working operators in the top cities would be 9 million square feet by this year.

The JLL report found that co-working spaces are also intent on upping their coolness quotient as that’s what millennials seek from their work environment. Not surprising, with 72% of the start-up founders in the country being less than 35 years. Boardgames, libraries, cafes, and beanbags were added to the space. Next, spaces announced they were going to be pet-friendly — Code7 and WeWork India, in Chennai for instance. And now, after the pup, it’s the turn of the pub.

Tharoor has been consistent in his criticism of the Modi government and its choices, both in Parliament and elsewhere. So when the Publishers and Booksellers Guild got in touch with him to speak on current issues, he readily agreed.

The first session has been scheduled at 3.30pm in association with Citizen Speak, a forum of intellectuals that has been lending its voice to the ongoing protests. The discussion — ‘We are who we elect’ — will see Tharoor in conversation with members of Citizen Speak, political theorist Ashish Nandy, director Aparna Sen and chief of Future Hope Sujata Sen .

“We have associated with this session because we are a civil society platform that advocates the need for a democratic, pluralistic, inclusive society and such sessions bring forth such thoughts,” said Piya Chakraborty, spokesperson of Citizen Speak.

However, it is the session titled ‘Disorder, Darkness and the Tharoor Way’ that will see the writer speak about the fear and uncertainty over issues of citizenship and where, according to him, the country is headed.

“The city is seeing a lot of protests and emotions are running high over the issues. We are eager to hear Tharoor’s opinions. The conversation will focus on political issues,” said Samhita Chakraborty, who will be in conversation with the writer-politician.

The session has been named keeping three of Tharoor’s books in mind — ‘Disorder from World Disorder and the Indian Imperative’, ‘Darkness from An Era of Darkness’ and ‘The Hindu Way’. “We hope he gives interesting insights into Hinduism versus Hindutva as he has done in his book,” Samhita said.

Agra: On the 23rd day of their indefinite strike, traders of Sanjay Place market dressed up as Gandhi’s three monkeys to protest Agra Municipal Corporation’s (AMC) levy of parking fee at the market.

Amid sloganeering, traders said like Gandhi’s three monkeys, public representatives are acting deaf, Mayor Naveen Jain blind and senior AMC officials dumb with regards to their complaint.

Senior Congress functionary Shabbir Abbas came to the dharna spot to extend his support to the traders.

Since January 14, traders of Sanjay Place have been sitting on an indefinite strike against AMC’s introducing parking fees at 38 places in the market premises. They claimed it violates norms, as they had already paid a one-time parking fee at the time of purchasing the property.

Secretary of Sanjay Place Market Association Heeren Agarwal said, “The AMC administration is trying to exploit traders by illegally charging parking fee, which we have already paid for. To muzzle our voices, a fake FIR has been registered. We will continue our fight against the parking mafia backed by the mayor.”

The dispute over parking fees between Sanjay Place traders and AMC is sub-judice. Traders want AMC to cancel parking contracts till the court delivers its verdict in the matter.

The association’s treasurer, Vinay Mittal, alleged despite the ongoing case at the sessions court, the AMC administration had issued parking contracts for three years to “people associated with BJP”. “AMC officials also get a share of the parking fee illegally collected from the market. We will not withdraw our protest till AMC rolls back its decision,” he said.

The court directed authorities to ensure free flow of traffic on Loop Road

CHENNAI: There has been no let up in the Madras high court’s resolve to reclaim the Loop Road off the light house for motorists. On Thursday, it summoned the corporation commissioner, city police commissioner and the joint commissioner of traffic (south) to court on February 21, and ordered 24x7 vigil on the stretch.

A division bench of Justices Vineet Kothari and R Suresh Kumar asserted the Loop Road becomes increasingly non-motorable, particularly after 3pm, due to fishermen selling fish, and directed the corporation and police to maintain 24/7 vigil to ensure free flow of traffic .

“Chennai corporation commissioner, the police commissioner and their subordinates and also the joint commissioner (south traffic) will ensure that the entire Loop Road is kept free from encroachments and a 24x7 hours vigil is maintained to ensure that nobody is allowed to sit or squat on the Road or landside footpath of the road for selling fish, so as to allow a free flow of traffic of motorists, scooters and pedestrians,” said the bench.

Adding that there are also reports of people encroaching on the land side of the footpath on the Loop Road by raising constructions while the seaside footpath is yet to be created for which necessary approvals are in the process of being taken by the corporation, the bench directed the encroachments shall be identified and removed immediately.

Officials shall furnish a report along with site photographs on the next date of hearing, the bench added. As to the construction of footpath on the seaside of the road, the corporation submitted that it has given a letter to CRZ authority seeking relaxation for some time for furnishing map with scale of 1:4000 for the time being.

Recording the same, the bench directed the corporation to file a status report in respect of the new fish market to be constructed on 2 acres of land on the landside of the Loop Road and progress report of the construction with time frame within which it shall be completed.

The issue pertains to a batch of pleas, including one by Fishermen Care organisation, seeking to enhance allowance provided to fishermen families during the fishing ban period.

During the course of hearing, the court expanded the scope of the litigation and directed the corporation to regulate hawking on the Marina and the Loop Road.

93,['6/02/2020'],Kolkata: Police may draw up SOP to curb unregulated use of ambulances,"This story is from February 6, 2020

Cops inspect the spot in Tangra

KOLKATA: Unregulated use of ambulance, often at the hands of novice drivers, is a criminal waste of a key health resource, said cops and experts, referring to the case, where an ambulance driver ran over an elderly person in Tangra late on Tuesday.

Priyanka Pramanik, daughter-in-law of deceased Gopal Pramanik, also alleged the driver, Sk Abdur Rahman (26), and his brother-in-law tried to pull her into the vehicle when her father-in-law intervened and was knocked down.

Barely one and a half years ago, an ambulance, which was being driven by an underage boy, ran over a youth near the Lords Bakery crossing while the vehicle was being used for a non-medical purpose. Around six months before that, an AC mechanic was caught posing as a doctor in an ambulance, ferrying a patient to a city hospital. The charge sheet filed in the case has details of how ambulances are often misused and handled by non-experts.

But nothing seems to have changed on ground as was evident from the Tangra incident and another recent case, in which an ambulance driver was caught carrying narcotics.

Police claimed though the ambulance involved in Tangra’s incident had merely a traffic rule-violation case against it, a religious institution, which had donated the vehicle, claimed the driver barely ever updated them on the ambulance’s movements. Police plan to draw up an SOP , asking guards, where big hospitals are located, to carry out surprise checks on ambulances.

“Given the scarcity of ambulances in Kolkata, it is necessary to regularise the vehicles and put them under a framework . This is yet to be done, though a number of other measures have been announced. It is important to ensure ambulances are handled by trained personnel, and this should include drivers, who should be trained in driving ambulances. The presence of paramedics should also be made compulsory,” said the CEO of a private hospital. “But the entire ambulance business is run like an unregulated sector, with neighbourhood clubs ruling the trade. It goes without saying that they flout all rules.”

Senior cops at Lalbazar agreed. “It’s appalling that ambulances are often misused for multiple purposes even in Kolkata. Once a vehicle is registered as an ambulance, it can’t be used for anything other than ferrying patients. We probably don’t even have a system of registering ambulances. So long as ambulances are left to untrained people, the system will be misused. It is dangerous that even underage drivers are employed,” said an officer at the headquarters.

CHENNAI: For techie Mallika, the 20 minutes she spent trapped inside a restroom at a star hotel in Nungambakkam is something she will remember for her lifetime. Unable to open the door and stuck inside with no cellphone reception, she had no idea of how to reach the hotel authorities. Only then did she realize that she had the Kavalan SoS app on her mobile phone. A click on the app’s red button and police reached the hotel within two minutes to assist her, she narrates.

“It was 11am, and it was a small room. I tried to keep my cool for two minutes. But I panicked the moment I realized something was wrong with the lock,” said Mallika, the victim.

The lock on the door was jammed and the hotel management had no clue of her ordeal until a sub-inspector from Nungambakkam approached them. After a 10-minute struggle to try to open the door, they had to break open the lock to rescue the techie.

“I tried calling out for help, but realized the hotel staff wouldn’t be able to hear it as the restroom was a isolated corner,” says Mallika. “That I have the Kavalan app struck me suddenly, and I used the SOS feature. I was surprised by the super-quick response.” This was the first time she used the app in the six months she had it on her phone. “It is nice that cops help you even in such emergency situations,” she said.

More than 1 million users in Tamil Nadu have downloaded the Kavalan app. As per data provided by police, Chennai tops with about 1.60 lakh users, followed by Coimbatore district .

KOCHI: As the fifth edition of Seeding Kerala summit is set to begin on Friday, Entri, a Kochi-based edtech startup with focus on local languages, has received $1.4 million in seed round, the second highest funding this year for a Kerala startup.

The funding, which saw investor participation from US and China, was led by Good Capital , an India-focused, pre-seed to Series A venture capital fund.

The startup, which is accumulating 6,000 users per day and has a base of 1.4 million, plans to channel the funds to content creation and revving its sales engine. “Right now we cater to 65 different exams and we want to take it to 125 in a year. We want to scale the user base to five million in the next 12 months,” said Entri chief technology officer and co-founder Rahul Ramesh.

Entri has course content for those preparing for public service commission examinations in Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Telangana and Andhra Pradesh. It also caters to aspirants of IIT-JEE, NEET, ComedK and KEAM. The content is offered in multiple languages, including Tamil, Telugu, Kannada and Hindi besides Malayalam. Entri, founded by Ramesh and Mohammed Hisamuddin in 2017, currently has offices in Bengaluru, Delhi and Patna besides Kochi and employs more than 145 people. It also has 1,000 people from all over India working part-time on a crowdsourced content platform.

“Entri actually created a space which is a niche and people even in remote parts of Kerala and Karnataka could get access to coaching which they did not have before,” said Kerala Startup Mission CEO Saji Gopinath.

According to him, one of the best things Entri’s story tells you is that India has a very large localized market. “This is an area where we need to seriously look at to bring in investments,” Gopinath said.

Seeding Kerala summit, scheduled to be held on Friday and Saturday, has focus on high-net-worth individuals (HNIs) from the state.

“As of now, less than 10% of all the funding happening is from domestic investors. There is a need for lot more Kerala HNIs who can start looking at startups as an important constituency for investments,” he said. “They are all smart people who have large businesses but they do not look at startups as an investment vehicle,” he added.

“One good thing is that our funding size has gone up. The ecosystem is also moving. From angel funds we are moving to Series A and above funding. This is also a reflection of the maturity of the system,” Gopinath said.

Sanket Savalia flanked by his parents at their home in Amreli

Rajkot: The road to any big fat wedding starts with the invite, or kankotri , which forms the integral step to the days-long extravaganza. But like in all other components related to it, competition has not spared the humble invite too — it’s getting fatter and costlier by the day.

But not be done creatively, this Amreli groom literally thought out of the envelope. And kudos to Sanket Savalia’s efforts, his wedding card will be treasured by all the invitees. For, it helps people not only remember his wedding date but also about various government schemes and how these can be availed. This multi-utility invite soon turned a hit on social networking sites.

Savaliya has created two kinds of invites — a hard copy and a digital version. While the hard copy contains a summary of government schemes, the digital invite details these schemes.

The 26 year old is a native of Gadhkada village in Savarkundla taluka will exchange vows on February 9.

While Savalia is a research associate with IIM-Ahmedabad’s educational innovation bank project, his fiancée Ankita, who too graduated in management from an institute in Ahmedabad, hails from a village near Amreli district.

Talking to TOI, Savalia said, “My parents are illiterate which led them to face many challenges in life. There are many government schemes which can be helpful to the poor and uneducated people, but owing to lack of education they remain ignorant of these. I only tried to provide such details to these needy people and would consider it a blessing if even 10% people benefit from the card.”

The bride is also part of the eureka invite! She said she wanted to spread the importance of girls’ education. “I have seen that in the villages parents don’t send their daughters to study in towns after completion of primary education. I have tried to highlight the importance of girl’s education in the society in the wedding invitation,” Ankita added.

Savaliya’s father Jivanbhai, who was a diamond worker in Surat once, too tried in his way to spread information about such beneficial schemes among the villagers.

The NADT has not paid property tax to the tune of Rs21.42 lakh.

Visvesvaraya National Institute of Technology (VNIT) too figured in the list of tax defaulters and its outstanding too has increased from over Rs27.04 crore to Rs30.12 crore. Even dues of government hospitals like IGGMCH have increased to Rs5.07 crore. National Research Centre for Citrus also has not paid property tax to the tune of Rs29.39 lakh for its property on Amravati Road.

The Nagpur Improvement Trust, which is earning thousands of rupees as fees from those using its swimming pool on North Ambazari Road, has an outstanding tax to the tune of Rs33.25 lakh.

A senior Congress leader, who is builder by profession, too has defaulted on tax of over Rs42 lakh.

Senior officials from the NMC’s zone offices admitted they are falling short in recovering taxes from big defaulters. The officials claimed that they have been issuing notices to the defaulters, but hardly anyone is responding. Of the defaulters, many have challenged the tax notice in court.

Civic activists said the NMC should act tough against all tax defaulters, but it should target the biggies first. Like any other common citizen, properties of big defaulters should also be attached and if they fail to clear the dues, the NMC should proceed with auction procedure, said the activists.

AHMEDABAD: The Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation ( AMC ) has begun a drive against encroachments in basements or on parking space. Not only are parking spaces being turned into shops illegally, basements are doubling up as storage rooms or as space for generator sets.The AMC on Wednesday sealed seven units at six buildings in Chandkheda and Sabarmati. All these units had encroached on parking space.The AMC cleared 7,730 square metres of encroachments in 58 buildings during the drive. The civic body found basements or areas meant for parking were encroached on and there were shops running illegally from there.AMC officials said that in the seven-day sealing drive, which began last Wednesday, 750 buildings were checked and 349 units were sealed in 58 buildings.Penalties of Rs 11 lakh were imposed on such buildings and the AMC removed shops and establishments running from parking spaces.A senior officer who was part of the drive said that they found illegalities in parking space even in buildings that had ‘building use’ (BU) permission.

CHENNAI: The state government will use a Rs 10,000-crore loan from the Beijing-based Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) to fund portions of corridors four and five of Chennai Metro ’s phase two and a stretch of the peripheral ring road in the north of the city. The first tranche of Rs 2,298.75crore was cleared last week for extension, renovation and modernisation of the Grand Anicut Canal System in the Cauvery delta.With Union government giving in-principle approval to seek funds from AIIB, a team of the bank led by vice-president D J Pandian held discussions with chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswami and senior bureaucrats on Wednesday to speed up the process. “A screening committee of the department of economic affairs sanctioned the proposals. The next mission is to finalize and sign the formal agreements,” said a senior official.The Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) has funded certain components of metro rail and peripheral ring road.Of the 118.9km long phase II of Metro Rail, JICA extends funding for parts of corridors three and five running for about 52.1km from Madhavaram to Sholinganallur and Madhavaram to CMBT.The AIIB will fund 16 kilometres of corridor four between Light House and Meenakshi College, and the remaining portions of corridor five. Asian Development Bank will also be funding the project. “We will float tenders for AIIB projects by June,” said an official source. Tenders have been floated for JICA projects.The AIIB will offer a $378 million loan for phase II and III of the long-awaited peripheral ring road project for which the Centre gave sanction in September last year. While phase I is done by JICA, the AIBB will take care of 57km between Thatchur in North Chennai and Sriperumbudur, linking Kolkata, Tirupati, and Bengaluru national highways. The ring road will reduce burden on city roads, and travel time to the other national highways and Ennore and Kattupalli ports in north Chennai.Many of the tanks in Grand Anicut system are in collapsed state. “Evolved by the officials of IAMWARM (Irrigated Agriculture Modernisation and Water Bodies Restoration and Management) and Trichy region, the project will restore the system, strengthen the embankments, rectify structural damage in the 80-year-old system,” said an official.

MEERUT: The local unit of special task force (STF) arrested three members of a gang smuggling contraband in Uttar Pradesh (UP) from Mandsaur in Madhya Pradesh. A carrier Dule Singh, native of Jhalawad in Rajasthan, was arrested along with two drug peddlers to whom he was supplying over 400 grams of smack worth over Rs 40 lakh in the international market.

In a joint operation late on Tuesday, Meerut unit of STF and Kairana police of Shamli district laid a trap near Panipat road in Shamli’s Kandhla area to intercept the carrier who was supposed to meet peddlers and hand over consignment of contraband.

Apart from Dule Singh, two local peddlers - Sultan Hasan from Haridwar in Uttarakhand and Deen Mohammed from Shamli in UP - were arrested. “During interrogation, carrier Dule Singh confessed of smuggling contraband from Mandsaur in Madhya Pradesh to peddlers in UP who used to later sell as per demand in places in West UP and Uttarakhand,” STF DSP Brijesh Singh said.

According to police, apart from Deen Mohammed, Hasan had also come down to Shamli from Haridwar to procure the contraband consignment. “The arrested peddlers after procuring the contraband would make small packets of it and sell it at higher prices locally,” the STF DSP added.

Sources in the law enforcing agencies claimed costly drugs - like smack and heroin - find its maximum demand among youngsters, particularly school students from affluent background. “The cost of the seized drug is between Rs 35 lakh and Rs 40 lakh in international market,” an STF sleuth said.

MEERUT: In a brutal double murder in UP’s Saharanpur district , an elderly couple was attacked with an axe by unidentified assailants at the residence of the deceased’s couple in Rampur Maniharan area on Wednesday morning. A police team led by senior superintendent of police (SSP) Dinesh Kumar P has reached the spot and investigation has begun.

The deceased were identified as Krishna Kumar Sharma (65) and Sunita Sharma (56) who used to live alone at their Saharanpur residence in Shivpuri colony. According to locals, the couple had three daughters who were married and settled while a son is preparing for competitive examinations in Delhi. Police are yet to ascertain the identity of the attackers who are said to be known to the family.

“Around 10 in the morning, neighbours heard cries for help. Some witnesses spotted the assailants fleeing the house through the terrace. The doors were bolted from inside. The couple was lying on the floor with fatal injuries inflicted by an axe,” Dinesh Kumar, Saharanpur SSP, said. The couple was rushed to a hospital where they were declared as “brought dead”.

According to police, diaries with money lending records were also kept on the table. While police are looking at all possible angles to ascertain the motive behind the murders, it has begun pursuing the only lead in the investigation as of now - fallout with someone in the money lending business.

“We have registered a case under section 302 [murder] of the IPC. Three teams have been formed and we are trying to ascertain the identity of the assailants through CCTV footages in the area,” SSP Kumar added.

108,['6/02/2020'],Natpac suggests flyover at Thiruvallam to ease traffic,"This story is from February 6, 2020

Thiruvananthapuram: Though the widened Kazhakoottam-Mukkola national highway is a boon for motorists, Thiruvallam Junction is an exception. It is the only stretch on the national highway, where motorists drive with impunity on the wrong side of the road, posing a major safety threat.

Due to the absence of a service road across the Karamana river and the difficulty in accessing the Ambalathara-East Fort road, motorists ply in two-directions along the old Thiruvallam Bridge.

Now, based on a request from traffic south division, the National Transport Planning and Research Centre ( Natpac ) has submitted a traffic congestion mitigation study report for Thiruvallam.

While the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) has been mulling constructing a service bridge across the river, the Natpac has suggested that it was not feasible.

The research centre ruled out the option of a service bridge as the Old Thiruvallam Junction is very close (about 80m) to the Karamana river. While ensuring the required slope, one end of the ramp will go beyond the old Thiruvalla Junction and therefore, it is not practical, it noted.

As a long-term measure, the Natpac has suggested construction of a 7.5-metre wide flyover connecting one side of the national highway to the Ambalathara Road. The new foot over bridge will have to be relocated for the construction.

For the short-term, the Natpac has suggested a segregated lane of around three metres from Old Thiruvallam Junction to the location, where Ambalathara Road meets the NH. Traffic from Kovalam and Venganoor to Ambalathara side can ply on the segregated lane.

The authorities have also been suggesting one-way regulation near Kumarichantha to mitigate the traffic issues. As per the plan, traffic from Kovalam side moving towards Ambalathara should take a right turn from Kumarichantha Junction to move towards Ambalathara Road, using the Kumarichantha road.

“One-way regulation needs to be implemented on the Kumarichantha road, which is regulated as two-way, except for heavy vehicles and public transport vehicles. Traffic from Venganoor side and that which moves towards Ambalathara, should use the service road to reach the central median opening located near Archana Royal Park Hotel and take a U-turn to join the traffic towards Kumarichantha and then access Ambalathara by taking a right turn at Kumarichantha Junction,” the note suggested.

The Natpac team has found that there was no provision on the NH at Thiruvallam Junction for the vehicles plying from Kovalam/Venganoor direction to take the road towards Ambalathara direction. Motorists have to drive till Kumarichantha, around 1km from Thiruvallam Junction, for taking a U-turn to access the Ambalathara Road.

To avoid it, motorists coming from Kovalam side cross the central median opening near the Old Thiruvallam Junction to access the Ambalathara Road by driving on the wrong side. Motorists coming from Venganoor too drive on the wrong side.

Gorakhpur: Purvanchal Sena — a lesser-known Dalit outfit that had extended support to the January 29 Bharat Bandh called by Bahujan Mukti Morcha against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and National Register of Citizens (NRC) — has now launched a postcard campaign aimed at compelling the Narendra Modi government to roll back what it dubs the “black law”.

Since the launch on Monday, the outfit has got 3,000 like-minded residents to write postcards to the PM against CAA and NRC, which it feels betray the spirit of the Constitution. The campaign, which is also rife on social media, also seeks DNA-based NRC instead of one that asks people to show papers to establish citizenship.

“At a time the economy is going south following back-to-back demonetisation and GST blows, the Centre is ready to push the country towards another financial turmoil by spending crores of rupees on NRC and NPR (National Population Register) exercises. Is this fair when the GDP is at an all-time low and unemployment at its peak?” said Dheerendra Pratap, national president of Purvanchal Sena.

Pratap emphasised that the CAA was against the Constitution, as it violated the clause of equality in Article 14, besides being discriminatory in nature. “Our mothers and sisters (reference to Shaheen Bagh) are fighting bravely against this black and dangerous law. In solidarity, we ask people to write postcards to the PM, urging him to immediately withdraw the law,” he said.

The outfit leader reiterated that they wanted DNA-based NRC to identify legal residents of India and demanded a ban on EVMs during elections to avoid misuse.

111,['6/02/2020'],TTD objects to aircraft flying over Tirumala temple,"This story is from February 6, 2020

Tirupati: The hovering of a chartered aircraft above Lord Venkateswara temple in Tirumala for the last two days has been giving anxious moments to officials of the Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams as well as temple priests.

After the aircraft, believed to be operated by the Survey of India, repeated the exercise several times on Monday and Tuesday, TTD officials contacted the air traffic control (ATC) at Chennai airport and asked them to stop its movement. Sources said the ATC officials responded positively and the aircraft was not seen in Tirumala skies on Wednesday.

Survey of India carries out such exercises periodically to gather geospatial data. However, Agama advisors and temple priests have raised objections to the flying of the aircraft over the temple. Venugopala Deekshitulu, the chief priest at Tirumala temple, said no object should be allowed to fly in the airspace above the temple as per Vaikhanasa Agama.

“We have been demanding for Tirumala to be declared a no-fly zone for several years now. But time and again, some aircraft manages to fly in the airspace right above the sanctum sanctorum of the temple, leading to sacrilege of sorts. Such incidents also hurt the sentiments of millions of devotees of Lord Venkateswara across the globe,” Deekshitulu said.

In 2012, when N Kiran Kumar Reddy was the chief minister of undivided Andhra Pradesh, the state government and the TTD had requested the Centre to declare the Tirumala temple airspace as a no-fly zone. In 2015, the AP government reiterated its appeal during P Ashok Gajapathi Raju’s tenure as Union civil aviation minister. But, the directorate general of civil aviation (DGCA) turned down the request in 2016 and made it clear that the ancient hill town cannot be declared a no-fly zone.

The DGCA had earlier turned down similar pleas from the Jagannath temple in Puri (Odisha) and Sri Padmanabha Swamy temple in Kerala. Sources said the DGCA declined to declare Tirumala a no-fly zone as it feared that other prominent places of worship in the country would also come up with similar requests.

However, flights operating out of the Tirupati airport near Renigunta normally avoid flying over the Tirumala temple, keeping in mind the public sentiment attached to the issue.

Bijnor: Congress district president Sherbaz Pathan was picked up by police from outside Bijnor court on Wednesday for his alleged role in inciting a mob during anti-CAA protests on December 20, 2019.

City’s superintendent of police (SP), Lakshmi Nivas Mishra , told TOI, “Sherbaz Pathan was not arrested. He was taken to a police station for interrogation in connection with an anti-CAA protest. His role has been found in instigating a mob on December 20. Police are probing the matter. He was later set free.”

Notably, Pathan went to Bijnor court for some work and while coming out of the premises, the police reportedly detained him. He was kept in Bijnor city police station for around five and a half hours and later allowed to go.

Pathan said, “I was outside Bijnor court premises. A police team told me that the SP wants to meet me. I went to Bijnor police station with a police team where several police officers were present. They said that I was held for inciting an anti-CAA mob on December 20. They kept me in police station from 12pm to 5:30pm and later asked me to sign a few papers, and then allowed me to leave.”

The Congress member added, “I told the police that we had staged a peaceful protest at Gandhi Park on December 18. Since then, we did not take part in any procession or protest. Police are framing me under false cases now. The police are working under the directions of BJP leaders.”

KOLKATA: Presidency University vice-chancellor Anuradha Lohia had to be shifted out of the campus in an ambulance around 6.45pm on Wednesday after she reportedly fell ill due to the 31-hour gherao by students since 11am on Tuesday. University registrar Debajyoti Konar said she had to be taken to a hospital after she complained of breathlessness with restricted movement.

“When she was on the verge of collapse, we decided to shift her to a hospital. We arranged for an ambulance to move her out of the campus,” said Konar.

The VC, along with 40 heads of various departments and other officials of the varsity, were forced to stay back on the campus because of the agitation by the students.

Even on Monday, Lohia was confined in the chamber for over 16hours. On Tuesday morning, the VC had left the campus and returned to her office only after five hours. The students resumed the stir after she had come back to the campus.

However, the agitating students claimed that the VC had not been gheraoed. “We are only agitating because the university authorities have not met our demands,” said a student.

Before moving out of the campus on Wednesday, the VC had called for an all-faculty meeting on Wednesday afternoon. Following the meeting teachers had interacted with the agitating students. “But the meeting failed. When we heard that the VC was unwell, we allowed her to leave the campus. We shall continue with our agitation,” said a student.

Nitin Gadkari

NASHIK: Credai Nashik Metro has requested Union road transport and highways minister Nitin Gadkari to speed up the road projects undertaken by his department in the district.

A delegation of Credai Nashik Metro, led by MP Hemant Godse, met Gadkari in Delhi on Tuesday and discussed issues related to several road projects.

President of Credai Nashik Metro Umesh Wankhade said all these projects would improve Nashik’s road connectivity and help economic growth. “We have drawn his (Gadkari’s) attention towards the need to intensify the pace of construction of the by-pass of Nashik-Pune highway,” he said.

“The completion of by-pass roads at Narayangaon, Manchar and Rajgurunagar would reduce the travel time between Nashik and Pune by at least an hour,” he added.

Similarly, the delegation has requested the union minister to direct the authorities for speedy completion of the highway connecting Nashik with Gujarat via Peth area of Nashik district and the state highway from Wani to Saputara up to Gujarat border.

“Since the Mumbai-Nagpur Samruddhi Mahamarg would be passing through Nashik district at Ghoti we have appealed Gadkari to direct his ministry to set up a six-lane express-way connecting Nashik to Ghoti for Nashikites,” Wankhede said.

The delegation has also requested Gadkari’s intervention in matters related to strengthening of Nashik’s air connectivity.

“Since he hails from Maharashtra and is a senior cabinet minister in the central government we have sought his help to start flights connecting Nashik to Delhi, Bengaluru, Goa and Hindan. All these routes were sanctioned under Centre’s Regional Connectivity Scheme,” he added.

NAGPUR: Cab aggregator Uber foresees Nagpur emerging into its biggest non-capital and non-metro market. The company has clocked an overall growth of 35% in 2019, and is eyeing a double-digit growth for 2020 as well, it said in a press release issued here. The company says it has completed 15 million trips in the city in the last four years.

Uber has onboarded more than 10,000 ‘driver-partners’ in the city, and is now coming up with Uber Plus — a scheme to reward the drivers. This includes incentives like free medical consultations, concession on education modules, faster airport pickups and savings on vehicle maintenance costs. The drivers are also being given easy access to life and health insurance policies, the press release said.

“We have witnessed an impressive growth trajectory in the city and are looking forward to further expanding our footprint in 2020 with our new auto and intercity offerings,” said Krishna Veer Singh, Uber’s head of west India operations. Uber Auto has also seen major growth in Nagpur within a year, he said.

UP’s most wanted gangster Badan Singh Baddo

MEERUT: Over 10 months after dramatically slipping out of police’s clutches, UP’s most wanted gangster Badan Singh Baddo again sprung a surprise with a social media post pinning his location to Rotterdam, a port city in Netherlands , stirring UP police into action which has been trying to trace the maverick don in the country.

UP police’s Special Task Force (STF), tasked to nab the missing gangster, said that it could a ploy by Baddo to deflect police’s attention. However, the cyber cell of police has been alerted and asked to probe the activity.

“We were told about the social media activity on Tuesday evening. Cyber cell has been alerted and a probe has begun,” Ajay Sahni, Meerut's senior superintendent of police (SSP) said.

On Tuesday evening, two Facebook posts were made from the account of ‘ Badan Sandhu ’, believed to be of the gangster.

While one update was about his location, which was pinned to Netherlands, the other was a rant against a former UP DGP in which he spoke about “criminal nexus of police and mafias in fuelling organised crime in the state in past”.

STF’s Meerut unit, which has been leading the investigation to find Baddo, claimed that the social media activity was most likely an attempt to derail the ongoing investigation. The agency is yet to clinch a breakthrough in the last 10 months.

“We have begun investigation in the Facebook updates made from the account. This could be an attempt to mislead the ongoing probe. There is also a fair chance that he got it done from someone else. He has tried to mislead police in the past through internet calls, making it appear that he is calling from outside the country,” STF DSP Brijesh Singh said.

With more than 30 cases of murder, robbery, loot and extortion, Baddo, who was serving life sentence, is currently the most wanted criminal in UP and carried a reward of Rs 2.5 lakh on his head.

In May last year, over a month after his escape from police custody, an audio recording of Baddo in which he was purportedly in conversation with a business rival in Meerut had gone viral on social media. In the recording, Baddo was threatening the man at the other end of dire consequences if his son was not given a clean chit in the ongoing police investigation into his escape. His son, Sikandar, was made a co-conspirator in the escape.

Baddo escaped on March 28 last year after allegedly entertaining police personnel in a Meerut hotel where alcohol laced with sedatives was served. 17 people including nine policemen were booked for their alleged role in Baddo’s escape.

Known for bespoke tuxedos, Swiss watches and luxury vehicles, the gangster owns a palatial house in Meerut and is said to own businesses in Australia where his estranged wife and daughters are settled.

Fitness expert Anwar Wahab conducts a bootcamp for the marathon

By: Puja Baruah

KOLKATA: Around 3,000 people are expected to converge on Red Road on Sunday morning as the Times Half Marathon is flagged off, promoting the importance of a clean environment .

Debanshu Dasgupta, director of Straightline, which will curate the event, said the response have been great. “Over 2,500 entries have already registered and we expect another 1,000 people to join the event.” Participants can register on www.timesmarathonkolkata.com. Echoing Dasgupta, Prasanta Saha, the race director, said, “Words about the event have spread wide. It is a run for a cause, a run for the City of Joy.”

Sudhir Ahuja, a sports enthusiast, is looking forward to this event. “I am a regular marathon runner , having completed over 20 half marathons and two full marathons across India,” he said. Equally excited is model and a trained mountaineer, Madhabilata Mitra. “Running is the best way to stay fit, calm and focused,” she said, adding she tries to motivate others to participate in marathons.

Samir Agarwal, an investment banker by profession, took up running seriously around four years ago. Since then, he has taken part in a number of 10km marathons and about a dozen half marathons. He aims to run a full marathon in future.

Rana Dasgupta, CEO, Apollo Gleneagles Hospitals in Kolkata, said, “This run also stands for something else that is extremely topical in these times: the message that we should do our best to keep the city air clean. We are all aware of the poor air quality index (AQI) in Kolkata and most other urban areas of India. Air pollution around the world is poor but we have to start addressing the issue somewhere. Let us all pledge to do our own bit and not contribute to the rising pollution. We can do this by performing simple tasks, like ensuring our vehicles confirm to the latest emission norms, avoiding bio-mass burning and making sure we do not add anything that would be harmful to the environment.”

Public relations and communication consultant Swati Poddar, a fitness enthusiast, is all geared up for the Sunday event, which will have three categories of 3km, 10km and 21km runs. “I have been running for six years now. I got a chance to test my own limits,” she said.

Abhishek Lodha has an advice for people who are yet to decide on whether to participate or not. “To realize your true potential, you have to first find your limits and then muster the courage to go past them,” he said. Another enthusiastic participant is Bharat Bagla, a financial planner. Bagla started running five years ago and has participated in over 50 events in different formats both in India and abroad.

Erode: Forest officials have set a trap to catch the leopard that has been preying on sheep and goats in villagers near Andhiyur. According to them, three villagers have lost their livestock in the leopard attack so far.

The leopard had been roaming around Periyakodiveri, Dasappagoundanur and Kongarpalayam villages near Andhiyur for the past one week, spreading fear among the villagers, a forest official said. All the three villages are situated close to Sathyamangalam Tiger Reserve (STR).

The villagers said they had spotted the leopard even during the day while they were working in sugarcane fields. “I have seen the leopard. I was lucky as it went into the forest as I shouted in fear,” S Govindan, a villager, said.

The villagers had then approached the forest officials, who started to monitor the animal’s movement manually, a week ago. However, they couldn’t trace the leopard. On Wednesday, they set up automatic cameras in 10 main spots in the villages. “We have placed the cameras in areas where the leopard has reportedly roamed around in the past one week,” the forest official said. He said the cameras would capture the image of the animal if that were to pass by them.

The officials have also set up cages with goats inside them at all the three villages to trap the leopard. More than 15 forest personnel have been deployed in the villages to take stock of things round the clock.

Foresters have warned the villagers not to come out of their houses at night to avoid man-animal conflict. “We are hopeful of trapping the leopard in a couple of days,” the official said.

The average wholesale onion prices have dropped by about 80% in last one-and-a-half months — from Rs 8,625 per quintal on December 16 to Rs 1,800 per quintal now.Bharti Pawar, the BJP MP from Dindori in Nashik district, had written to the Centre last month, urging the government to withdraw the ban. Pawar brought up the matter against during the Budget session in Parliament recently. She said that there has been an increase in the arrival of fresh onion crops across the country, and the wholesale prices are coming down.“Farmers may suffer more losses if the wholesale prices continue to drop due to the arrival of fresh onion crops in the markets. The government needs to withdraw the ban on onion exports to stop a further fall in wholesale prices,” she said.Manoj Jain, an onion trader, said that China is the major onion exporter. However, the recent outbreak has led to a drop in demand for Chinese onions in the international markets. Therefore, India is in a position to capture international markets now.“The average wholesale onion prices have already dropped below Rs 2,000 per quintal. The country needs to end the ban on onion exports. This will be a win-win situation for farmers and also the country — which will earn foreign currencies,” said Jain.On September 29, 2019, the Union ministry of commerce and industries had imposed a ban on onion exports in a bid to check the prices in the domestic market.

Thiruvananthapuram: As the confusion over interim development order (IDO) and sanctioned master plan (SMP) deepens, the city corporation is set to seek a formal direction from the state government regarding which provision shall be applied while approving projects in the city.

The town planning committee will present a resolution in the next council asking the government to issue a directive in this regard.

Local self-government minister A C Moideen had held two meetings on December 4 and 17 regarding renewal of permit for one building and allocation of permit for another apartment project after the officials denied sanctioning the projects citing that the sites came under green strip area as per sanctioned master plan (SMP) of 1971.

The proceedings of these meetings show that additional chief secretary (ACS) T K Jose reiterated in both meetings that IDO came as a replacement for sanctioned master plan and hence SMP of 1971 is not in effect in the city.

With regards to the renewal of permit in one case, it was ascertained that the site was marked as mixed zone under IDO and hence there was no obstacle for renewal of permit.

The points raised repeatedly by ACS in both meetings upholding IDO as a replacement for SMP however lack clarity, according to officials.

Palayam Rajan, chairman, town planning committee, said that SMP is still being followed in areas which had long been part of city corporation before erstwhile panchayats got added to the city. “We have to get clarity regarding this point from the state government and a resolution will be presented in the council,” said Rajan.

There were also concerns over the validity of IDO, which came into effect in 2017.

As per the town and country planning Act, the IDOs shall cease to operate in the event of failure to publish the master plan within the time limit prescribed for publication of the plan under the Act.

The corporation has to publish the draft master plan within two years from the date of resolution taken to prepare a master plan.

The resolution was taken by corporation in 2017, and going by the provision, IDO would cease to exist by 2019. However, in the case of Thiruvananthapuram, IDO was issued based on published master plan of 2013 and hence the time limit doesn’t apply, said town planning officials.

It is in the wake of these concerns that corporation is gearing up to take up the matter at the government level.

Vadodara: Knowing which species of the birds are visiting Wadhwana Lake every winters is now just a finger tap away. The forest department has launched a mobile application ‘Birds of Wadhwana’ that has names of the birds species that migrate to Wadhwana in winters before flying out. The app was launched on Sunday that was celebrated as World Wetland Day across the world.

“Bird lovers visiting Wadhwana will be able to upload information about different species of birds that they spot at the lake. Names of the species are already mentioned in the app. Users just have to tick on the name whenever they spot any bird in or around the lake,” said Dr Rahul Bhagwat, bird photographer who has designed the app.

Those using the app will be able to see names of birds that visit the wetland regularly. It already has names of 240 species.

Forest officials said that they are preparing proposal to make Wadhwana a Ramsar site and this app will help them in documenting birds in a better way. “We document the birds that visit Wadhwana. But sometimes we may miss out on some bird species. This app will help us in identifying many more species,” said F A Khatri, range forest officer, Vadodara.

If any bird watcher sees any new species, he or she can add it in the app that will available for people on online store from February 20.

Bhavik Patel, a marine conservationist working with Bombay Natural History Society, who is working with the forest department to convert Wadhwana into Ramsar site said, “The more information we have about birds visiting Wadhwana, the better are our chances of getting Ramsar site nod. We are trying to gather as much information about the lake, migratory birds, fishes and plantations in and around the lake.” BNHS is now conducting a first professional census of birds at the lake site.

Located at about 50km from the city, Wadhwana sees an influx of thousands of local as well as migratory birds between December and February.

HYDERABAD: It appears fish vendor P Ramesh fell for a bait and walked into a trap laid by his acquaintance. Police investigating the murder of 53-year-old fish vendor, which took place in SR Nagar, found that a ‘honeytrap’ was set up by his friend Srinivas with an intention to extort money from the victim’s family. They took three persons, including two women, into custody.

Prime accused Srinivas, who was taken into custody on Tuesday night, was questioned. Police found that Ramesh and Srinivas became friends some time ago. Srinivas discovered that Ramesh’s family was rich and had reportedly bought a house for Rs 3 crore in Borabanda recently.

Sources privy to the investigation told TOI that Srinivas allegedly hatched a plan to abduct Ramesh and extort money from his family. As part of his plan, Srinivas took two rooms of a house on rent in Jawahar Nagar a month ago and allowed Ramesh to use them.

“On Saturday, Srinivas lured Ramesh to the rented house, promising to arrange a woman for him. After Ramesh reached the house and found no woman there, he got annoyed and argued with Srinivas. The accused attacked Ramesh, who was in an inebriated state, with a hammer and stole the victim’s chain and ring before he locked the place and left it,” the sources said.

Officials said that though Srinivas returned to the room with an intention to dispose of the body, he gave up the idea. He locked the room and started to communicate with Ramesh’s family on WhatsApp with the vendor’s phone from Sunday morning and demanded Rs 90 lakh as ransom for the release of Ramesh.

“The accused negotiated with the victim’s family till 7 pm on Tuesday, claiming that Ramesh was still alive,’’ the investigators said. On Tuesday night, locals discovered foul smell emanating from the house and discovered Ramesh’s body.

When police verified the victim’s phone call data record (CDR), they found the numbers of a few women besides calls made to the accused. All these women and the accused are now in police custody. Apart from Srinivas, the role of a woman was also being probed by police since they discovered she was aware about Ramesh’s murder.

Representative image

VIJAYAWADA: It seems the deterrents put in place by the government to wean people away from alcohol is not having its desired effect.

While there has been a substantial dip in liquor sales in the state since the new excise policy came into force, the decline has been largely attributed to the non-availability of alcohol.

Across Vijayawada , shopkeepers explained that people are willing to visit the shops several times and stand in queues to purchase more bottles of liquor. Apart from that, adjacent pan shops have been doing a brisk business by selling paper bags for 5 to 10 depending on the demand.

“None of the customers, we found, have relented because of the rule. Many of them return to purchase additional bottles on the same day and it is impossible to keep tabs on such people,” a worker at Andhra Pradesh Beverages Corporation Limited (APBCL) said.

Other tactics used to purchase extra bottles, include taking help of other customers in the queue who are there to buy fewer than three bottles. Consequently, the given the sustained demand, the earning of liquor traders have not dipped. They are rather making a substantial profit.

Speaking to TOI, excise officials said that the new liquor policy while being stringent on belt shops, has pushed up the price of liquor considerably in the black market. A bottle of beer is sold for approximately 220 in the black market that is almost 46% more of the original MRP in belt shops.

“While there are risks involved in running a belt shop, but the high profits are helping them thrive,” a prohibition and excise enforcement official explained.

Ramos Virgilio left for Manila on Tuesday morning

KOLKATA: The 44-year-old Filipino , who underwent a life-saving surgery in the city on January 17 after he suffered a stroke mid-air, has been sent back to his country after post-operation recovery. Doctors at Charnock Hospital, where Ramos Virgilio was treated, said he would require rehabilitation, including physiotherapy, back home .

A Dubai-bound flight from Manila made an emergency landing in Kolkata on January 15 after Virgilio felt uneasiness and developed chest pain mid-air. He was taken to the hospital on VIP Road, where doctors detected haemorrhagic and ischemic stroke. A craniotomy was carried out two days later, as the family took time to give their consent for the surgery. “In case a person suffers stroke on the right side, as did Virgilio, the left side is usually paralyzed. But Virgilio is able on walk his own though his left hand is still weak. His willpower is amazing. We have advised rehabilitation therapy for him at home,” said neurosurgeon Rohit Mishra, who operated on Virgilio. He left on Tuesday morning.

According to sources in the hospital, Vergilo was one of the most cheerful and cooperative patients, having made no fuss during his 20-day stay. After the authorities ensured regular communication with his wife, Loraine, back in Manila, the only thing he asked the doctors frequently was when he could fly home. “We are happy we could send him home in good health,” said Charnock Hospital MD Prashant Sharma. “No payment has been made for his treatment yet, but the insurance agency concerned said the dues would be cleared. We could not hold back the patient for want of payment.”

NASHIK: Two robbery cases were registered with the Gangapur police station and the Mumbai Naka police stations. While one is a chain-snatching case, the other is related to snatching of a cellphone from a person.

The Mumbai Naka police said that a woman was robbed of her gold chain worth Rs 40,000 in the Deepali Nagar area of Mumbai Naka. The police said that the victim, a 44-year-old resident of the same area, had alighted from a city bus at the Deepali Nagar bus stop at around 7 pm on Tuesday, and was proceeding towards her home.

When she had reached the Laxmi Supermarket area in front of the Sharma Wedding Hall, a biker suddenly stopped in front of her and snatched her gold chain weighing 15 grams. The chain-snatcher then fled the scene. The Mumbai Naka police said they were investigating the case.

Meanwhile, in another case registered with the Gangapur police station, a 21-year-old youth stated that he was robbed of his cellphone, worth Rs 5,000, by two unidentified people on Monday near the Wagh Guruji Hospital.

The youth said that at around 7.30 am on Monday, two unidentified persons riding a scooter approached him and forcibly snatched the cellphone from his hand. They then escaped on their two-wheeler. The police are investigating this case too.

While the police claim to have increased patrolling all over the city and also activating more than 50 chowkeys, criminals have not been deterred from committing crimes. Chain robberies are occurring on almost a daily basis. Cases of robberies of cellphones from the hands of people too are on the rise.

Police officers said the robbery cases would be detected as soon as possible. If some new criminals have cropped up in the city, they would be traced and arrested.

Representative image

MYSURU: The Karnataka State Road Transport Corporation (KSRTC) has cancelled at least 64 schedules out of 472 that operate daily between Mysuru and Bengaluru. These buses were being operated by various divisions of KSRTC.

According to sources, a variety of reasons including increase in the number of trains between the two cities, launch of air service, traffic congestion on National Highway-766 especially after Ramanagar, are the reasons to reduce the number of services.

“The decision to reduce the number of services was taken due to poor occupancy rate on the existing schedules,” said R Ashok Kumar, divisional controller, KSRTC Mysuru rural.

Besides, between Hassan and Bengaluru, 50 schedules have been cut to make the route profitable.

“For one kilometre, the operating cost is Rs 36. We are not getting enough returns due to the poor occupancy rate. So we decided to bring down the number of schedules,” said an official of KSRTC Hassan division.

According to sources, in every three minutes, at least one bus leaves from Mysuru to Bengaluru. “Now the route service has been rationalised. Efforts are being made to bring down the number of buses operated between two cities,” said another official.

According to officials, more and more people are now switching to trains due to the cost factor and traffic congestion. “The train fare is nearly half of the bus fare. Added to this, even the slowest train between Mysuru and Bengaluru takes less than 3 hours to reach Majestic area. But KSRTC buses take an average of 3.5 hours to reach Satellite bus terminus on Mysore Road. And another 30 minutes travel is required to reach the Majestic. So people are shifting from buses to trains,” said an official. “Traffic congestion can be seen in many places including Mandya, Maddur and Chennapatna. Train service is becoming more and more popular,” he added.

Meanwhile, passengers feel that increased frequency of trains between Mysuru and Bengaluru has come as a big relief for them. “The road journey has become a nightmare. If the SWR introduces more trains, it will be helpful to the passengers,” said Raghavendra Adihikar, a bank employee who travels between Mysuru and Bengaluru daily.

ERODE: MLA Raja Krishnan released 1.25 lakh fish seeds into four lakes in Andhiyur assembly segment here on Wednesday to help local fishermen make a living.

Fishing activities had completely come to a standstill in the lakes, including Andhiyur and Ketti Samudram, as they had gone dry in the past five years due to severe drought. K R Balachandran, a fisherman, said, “Many of us had gone to neighbouring states such as Karnataka and Kerala for fishing to make a living.”

Some of the fishermen were, meanwhile, forced to work as farm labourers in surrounding villages.

The lakes, however, sprang back into life a bountiful southwest and northeast monsoon last year. Following this, the local fishermen had requested the district administration and the fisheries department to release fish seeds into the lakes.

The fisheries department subsequently issued 1.25 lakh fish seeds worth Rs 2 lakh to the district administration, which invited MLA Raja Krishnan as chief guest to release the same into the lakes.

S Kandasamy, another fisherman, said, “The fish seeds will grow within a few weeks and then fishing activities could be resumed in the lakes.”

Vadodara: Next time, if the autowala refuses to ferry you or demands higher fare, ring up the police.

In its bid to crack down on erring auto drivers, the police decided to act against such auto driver and may even suspend driving licenses of the guilty. The drive started near the railway station and state transport bus depot in Sayajigunj. More than 60,000 autos ply in the city regularly, according to RTO data.

“We had been getting a lot of complaints from citizens against rude auto drivers, with most complaints about them refusing to ferry passengers by meter fare, especially at night. The auto drivers make excuses that their meter is not working and then demand an exorbitant amount,” said Anupam Singh Gahlaut, city police commissioner.

Gahlaut said that this prompted the police to begin a drive against such erring drivers who loot passengers. Cops will patrol the areas around railway station and keep an eye on such incidents. If any passenger is being over charged, he or she can approach the cops and complain. “We will investigate the incident,” Gahlaut told TOI, adding that if found guilty, his driving license would be suspended and also cancel the vehicle’s registration.

At night, passengers do not have too many options to ride and hence auto drivers take advantage of it. “We had called a meeting of auto drivers before starting the drive. They were explained the rules and also warned against charging fares higher than stipulated from passengers. The auto drivers agreed to charge passengers by the meter,” Gahlaut added.

The police has begun the drive at four spots including railway station’s entry and exit, Kadak Bazaar and ST depot. In the coming days, the drive will be extended to other busy areas of the city. Senior police officials said that these four spots were chosen as they got most complaints from there.

Nidhi Sharma, homemaker

Over the last few years, many auto drivers in the city have stopped accepting meter fares. They always say that the meter is not working. I hope the police drive against such drivers helps passengers, especially at night.

Ananda Joshi, HR professional

Many auto drivers near the railway station simply refuse passengers who want to pay by the meter, or even those that want to travel a short distance. If the destination is far off, they quote an exorbitant amount. Strict action should be taken against such drivers to set an example.

Harish Rajput, auto driver

If the passenger insists on meter fare, the auto driver should agree. However, many a time even passengers haggle for a lumpsum amount. But those auto drivers who fleece passengers at night need to be dealt with firmly.

Nashik: The city police and the fire brigade department blocked vehicular movement on the Mumbai-Agra highway flyover , near the Garware Point, for nearly two hours following a major accident on Wednesday morning. The traffic was had to be diverted on the twin service roads along the highway.

A collision between a truck and a tanker carrying inflammable material had sparked a fire in the truck driver’s cabin at around 9.30 am. The brigade personnel had to douse the fire using foam and water and then cool down the oil tanker.

A collision had taken place at the very beginning of the flyover on Mumbai-Agra highway, near the Garware point. The oil tanker driver had entered the lane on the right and had a side collision with the open truck. The police said that the tanker’s rear hit the truck driver’s cabin from the side. This sparked a fire in the truck’s cabin. The police said that the truck driver and cleaner had to jump out of the vehicle.

The police said that soon after the fire broke out, other commuters on the highway called up the fire department and the police. Officials of the Cidco fire station said they got a call at 9.50 pm. Within 6 minutes, supervisor Ravindra Laad and firemen Balasaheb Lad and Avinash Sonawane reached the accident spot and began dousing the fire. The fire officials said that apart from dousing the fire, they also had to stop the dripping oil from the tanker. Further, since the oil tanker had heated up, it also had to be cooled down.

PI Kumar Chaudhary of the Ambad police station said, the oil from the tanker was dripping and the bodies of the two vehicles were also tangled with each another. That is why vehicular traffic on the flyover had to be stopped on a stretch of approximately 250 metre. Chaudhary said vehicles on both the ends of the flyover were stopped to prevent any untoward incident. After the tangled vehicles were separated with the help of a crane, the stretch was thrown open. The PI said no one was injured in the accident.

KANPUR: A 21-year-old student committed suicide allegedly by shooting himself at his house in Kamlapur locality under Sajeti police station of the district on late Tuesday night. Harshit Sachan, a B.Pharma student at a local institute, was reportedly under depression.

According to police, Harshit took the extreme step late on Tuesday night after dinner. “He and his mother were alone at the house at the time of the incident,” said Quan Kheda police outpost in-charge Avneesh Yadav. No suicide note was recovered from the spot, he added.

On coming across gunshot sound, Harshit’s mother Gita rushed to his room and found him lying in a pool of blood. On hearing her shrieks, his neighbours reached the spot and took Harshit to a nearby Community Health Centre where doctors at the emergency pronounced him dead on arrival. The police arrived at the CHC and shifted the body to morgue for autopsy, Yadav said.

“Harshit’s family members stated that after the death of his father, Ramakant Sachan, who had passed away a few years ago, Harshit was reeling under depression since then. They, however, feigned ignorance as to what led to sudden provocation prompting him to take such an extreme step. Investigations are underway in this regard,” said the police outpost in-charge.

ERODE: Two more accused in the murder case of Sankarampalayam panchayat president were arrested on Wednesday. With this, police have nabbed five accused in the case. However, the search for the mastermind of the crime is still on.

An investigation officer identified the arrested as M Siva, 24, and Surya alias M Muthumari, both residents of Madurai.

The panchayat president, S Radhakrishnan alias Chinna Thangam, 48, of Unjakkadu Thottam near Velli Tirupur in Andhiyur taluk, was hacked to death by a five-member gang on February 3.

The Velli Tirupur police had earlier arrested three of the gang members. “Siva and Surya were on the run. We got a tip about their hideout and arrested them today (Wednesday). They have been lodged in the Coimbatore Central Prison under judicial custody,” the officer said.

He said they had launched a manhunt for the mastermind of the crime, Arvind, who hired the five-member gang to avenge the murder of his father, who was killed by Radhakrishnan in 2013. That case is still pending with the Erode district court.

“Aravind, who is working with a private company in Chennai, have been missing since February 3. He had paid the gang Rs 3.5 lakh to murder Radhakrishnan,” the officer said.

The other arrested in the case are Saravanan, 26, Balamurugan, 26 and Rajesh 24, all residents of Pallavaram in Chennai.

CHENNAI: “Life would have been different had I stopped her that day,” said K Sripal. He has said this several times since March 11, 2018, when his wife S Kavitha died in an accident near the Koyambedu wholesale market. Kavitha was riding with her two children.Since it was a Sunday, Kavitha had gone to the market with her two sons -- Naman and Meeth. It was not the first time she was riding the two-wheeler with her sons. But on that fateful day, Kavitha lost balance when an autorickshaw hit the scooter. She suffered head injuries and died on her way to the hospital. Her sons survived the accident but live with the trauma of having watched their mother die.Kavitha’s case is not a rare incident in the city. Every day, hundreds of parents take more than one child on a two-wheeler either to drop them in schools or to pick them up. In many cases, accidents are fatal when riders don’t wear helmets. But instead of booking violators, the traffic police empathise with the parents. They are not booked for breaking the rule and endangering the lives of children.“That’s not true,” said a senior city traffic police official pointing out data on traffic fines. More than 40,000 people were penalised in 2019 for triple riding in Chennai. “We have stepped up our vigil. There were just 10,400 cases in 2018,” the officer said.But on most occasions, cases were booked when the offenders were stopped for jumping signals or speeding, he said. “When parents plead with police that they have to drop kids in school, they are let off,” he said.Parents say they are forced to take their children on two-wheelers because other options are either expensive or unsafe or unavailable. “My son’s school is demanding Rs 2,000 a month as bus fee. I can’t send my child alone in public transport. Autos are better option but they often take too many children and are unreliable. The best option for me is to drop my kids on my way to office,” said T Santhosh, a resident of Madipakkam .Renga Prasad, a transportation activist from Satta Panchayat Iyakkam, said there should be no compromise on safety. Load tests on two-wheelers by vehicle manufacturers conclude that the maximum permissible load per ride is 140kg to 180 kg. “The vehicle will become unstable if the load exceeds 200kg. The rider’s position gets changed making it difficult to apply brakes with the foot or change gears,” he said.But what makes deaths and injuries a double whammy for the victims family is that they don’t receive entire compensation. Kin of Ganeshan and Ragu, bikers who died in an accident at Sathyamangalam , were due a compensation of Rs 1.17 lakh. But the local accident claims tribunal ordered only 50% of compensation as there were three men on the bike at the time of the accident. Last May, the Madras HC upheld the order saying the remaining compensation will be detected towards their “contributory negligence”.Advocate V S Suresh Kumar said that in most instances, a case is booked against the bigger vehicle for insurance benefits but 10% to 50% of the compensation is deducted if the chargesheet mentions triple riding.“Even if the driver of the bigger vehicle was at fault, criminal charges against him are dropped because counsel argue that the bike was unstable as there were three riders,” he said.",chennai,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73974458,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-720608,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/when-three-is-a-crowd-and-an-invitation-to-disaster/articleshow/73970014.cms

Cap

Vadodara: The first step towards restoration of the Bhukhi stream, otherwise known as the Bhukhi Nullah, began on Wednesday.

The department of environmental studies of M S University in collaboration with the faculty of science student association started the ‘Bhukhi kaans and bank cleaning initiative’ in order to clean up 2.82km of the non-perennial tributary of Vishwamitri river that passes through its main campus.

The current initiative is to beautify the segment flowing through science faculty premises. “There will be many components in the restoration project but solid waste has to be removed first,” said head of the Department of Environmental Studies, Prof Kauresh Vachhrajani.

“With the help of students of our department and the faculty association, we have taken the small step to remove solid waste deposited on the banks of the stretch adjacent to the faculty of science,” he said.

Vachhrajani further said that the next step will involve all other departments and faculties for which awareness has already been created. “Also, all students and teachers can clean any solid waste that is seen deposited on the periphery. The university’s construction department will have to clean the stream,” he said.

Nearly 200 students wearing protective gear took part in the initiative and collected nearly two tractors full of plastic, thermocol sheets, packaging materials and other solid waste.

Around 15 students from the department will analyse the overall biodiversity of the stretch including its plant, microbes, water quality, soil quality and sources of soil and wet waste that is dumped in Bhukhi nullah as part of their dissertation studies.

Once the analysis is completed, with the support of field experts and with the Vadodara Municipal Corporation, a plan to upgrade the nullah will be drawn up.

Gujarat high court

AHMEDABAD: A descendent of migrants from Pakistan moved the Gujarat high court demanding that his name be entered into revenue records for the piece of land allotted to his forefathers by the Gujarat government in 1966.

Justice Biren Vaishnav asked the petitioner to raise the issue before the Banaskantha additional collector, who has been ordered to take a decision in this regard.

The petition was filed by 32-year-old Dinesh Bhill, who is from Kherola village of Lakhni taluka in the border district of Banaskantha. He said his forefathers and others had migrated from Karachi in 1947 and settled in the north Gujarat district.

In 1966, 36 farmers including Bhill’s forebearer were granted agricultural land by the state revenue department under the head of ‘Migrant and Unsheltered’. For over 50 years, the families possessed the land. Based on the government’s decision, the Banaskantha district collector passed an order allotting 316 acres of land to 36 farmers as ‘New Tenure’ land on permanent basis.

In March 1974, a deputy collector passed an order cancelling the allotment on the grounds of breach of conditions as the land holders did not cultivate the land. The farmers appealed against this order and the district collector quashed the cancellation in July 1974.

Bhil submitted that his forebearer was allotted 7 acres and he is cultivating the land parcel at present. After the district collector restored the land to his forebearer, the revenue authorities have not mutated his name in the revenue records for this piece of land.

Bhil cited various government resolutions mandating revenue officials to enter names in revenue records, and argued that despite representations, the authorities have not entered his name in revenue records.

Allahabad: Congress Sewa Dal (CSD) chief organiser Lalji Desai raked fresh controversy on Wednesday when he said that it wasn’t easy to decide if Veer Savarkar was indeed brave or not. CSD is one of Indian National Congress’ frontal organisations.

In Allahabad to attend CSD’s training camp at the Magh Mela ground on Wednesday, Desai said, “There were many people who fought a pitched battle against the British during the freedom struggle, but never surrendered before the government.”

“As far as Vinayak Damodar Savarkar is concerned, he had sought an apology from the British at least 11 times and nine of those were in written. The evidence of the correspondence is still available.”

He also questioned when high school teachers were being salaries in the range of Rs 7 to 12 during the British rule, why were they paying a monthly pension of Rs 60 to Savarkar.

Slamming Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) over their ideologies, Desai said, “Vinayak Damodar Savarkar was responsible for the partition of the country as he was the first person to suggest the two nation-theory.”

He also said that the organisation would soon release a 16–page booklet on Savarkar, which would contain several lesser-known facts about the right-wing leader along with proof.

He also said that the book would be distributed across the city.

Chandrababu Naidu

VIJAYAWADA: Leader of opposition N Chandrababu Naidu has dared chief minister YS Jaganmohan Reddy to seek fresh mandate before implementing the three capital cities proposal. He said that he would retire from active politics if people supported the three capitals proposal.

Naidu visited farmers at Thulluru on Wednesday and extended his support to them.

“No force on the earth could move the capital out of Amaravati . It was decided as the capital and people donated Rs 57 crore for the capital. The money is in APCRDA account,” Naidu said.

He added that Amaravati has become a global name in the last five years. “I had several dreams for Amaravati. I had a dream for every city in the state. But, this man, Jaganmohan Reddy, is destroying everything. He is a destroyer and not a dreamer,” Naidu said.

Claiming that AP was ahead of other states in the country in the last five years, the former chief minister regretted that the state is going back on every front. “This is reverse governance. He (Jagan) has no experience and no plans to develop the State. His party is a reverse party,” the TDP chief said.

Naidu asked the farmers of Amaravati to continue their fight against the three capital cities proposal. He told them their sacrifice of giving 33,000 acres of land for the capital would not go waste. “The world is aware of your contribution. Only the CM is not able to understand your sacrifice,” he said.

Naidu asked the chief minister to prove insider trade charges against TDP leaders. “We are ready to cooperate with the government. Why are you not proving the charges and not taking action,” he asked the chief minister.

Vadodara: Police are yet to lodge a formal complaint in the anti-CAA protests held in Tandalja area without permission last week.

The crime branch had summoned a couple of community leaders some days ago after the dharna but no one claimed responsibility for the dharna. On Monday, a formal application asking for permission for the protests was made.

Police haven’t granted permission for the dharna yet but every evening, a few hundred locals, mostly women from Tandalja area, gather at the plot near Saudagar Park.

“It is a political stunt and some people want to instigate the locals. We have talked with them and also explained CAA to the locals. As of now, we aren’t taking any step as we don’t want to create trouble,” said a police official.

Residents of Saudagar Park and adjacent areas had sat on dharna against CAA last week. On Sunday, the tent used by the protesters was removed by the supplier.

Sterling Road

CHENNAI: Walking may be the most common form of commuting, but pedestrians are the second-most vulnerable commuter group. A total of 1,254 pedestrians, including 291 in Chennai (the second highest in the country), were knocked down by speeding vehicles in 2018.

While the absence of pavements forces pedestrians to jostle for space on the city’s busy carriageway and risk getting hit by vehicles, two-wheeler users put them in danger by riding down footpaths to bypass traffic jams. Though the practice is common on Nelson Manickam Road, Chamiers Road, Old Mahabalipuram Road and in Vadapalani, the traffic police do little to stop and penalize errant motorists.

“Many riders don’t realise that they are violating the law. Utter lack of driving sense is the prime reason for this,” said V Santhanam, a civic activist from Chromepet who has been campaigning for safe pedestrian commute over a decade. Blaming the corporation for designing footpaths that “invite bikes”, Santhanam said, “The height of pavements is so low that bikes can easily get onto them and in due course the edges of a footpath become a slope for bikes.”

But a Greater Chennai Corporation official said bollards are placed on “vulnerable stretches” to prevent bikes from entering platforms but still riders enter through gaps kept for differently abled people. The gap between two bollards in roughly two feet (0.6m) but for wheelchair access it is around three feet (0.9m), he said.

Urban experts said if walking near bus stops and railway stations became unsafe, fewer people will take public transport in the future that will result in more private vehicles on the road.

Two PCR vans were damaged in the 10-km chase on Tuesday

Vadodara: An offence of dacoity was registered in connection with the robbery of betel nuts and dry fruits from a container truck following which a dramatic police chase had taken place on national highway-48 on Tuesday.

The second offence was registered on Wednesday based on the complaint by the driver of the container truck from which the valuables were robbed by around a dozen robbers.

In his complaint, Ramesh Pujar has stated that the robbers broke open the container’s lock and started siphoning off bags of dry fruits and betel nuts when he sleeping in the driver’s cabin after parking the truck in the bay on the highway. The stolen goods have been valued at Rs 8.7 lakh.

The police have already sent a team of cops to a godown in Surat where Pujar had delivered a part of the goods before proceeding towards Ahmedabad on February 3. “Our team will find out the name and details of the men who had unloaded the goods in Surat in case anyone from among them have been involved or passed on the information to the robbers,” said a police official.

Police are also scanning CCTV footage of four toll plazas where the container truck had stopped after entering Gujarat. The dry fruits and betel nuts were dispatched in the container truck from Karnataka. Police said that the truck had stopped at toll plazas in Navsari, Kamrej in Surat, Bharuch and Karjan. “The footage can give us some lead if the robbers were following them or just chanced upon the truck near Jambuva,” the police official said.

The robbers were stopped by a PCR van in the wee hours of Tuesday when they were siphoning off the goods. They, however, managed to flee on seeing the cops but were chased for several kilometres by two PCR vans on the highway. During the chase, the two police vehicles were damaged as the robbers rammed their truck with the two cars and also pelted stones at the cops.

VIJAYAWADA: Chief minister YS Jaganmohan Reddy on Wednesday justified his plan to decentralize administration and establish three capitals by saying that it was the only practical approach to develop the state. He said he had chosen Visakhapatnam as the capital city because it has all the infrastructure and holds the potential to compete with big cities in south India. He, however, said Amaravati will continue to be the legislative `capital’.Speaking at a private programme here on Wednesday, the chief minister said Amaravati would require Rs 1.09 lakh crore for basic infrastructure while the government has no money to invest.“We need Rs 1.09 lakh crore to invest in Amaravati while the state’s capacity is only Rs 5,000 crore,” he said and wanted to know what any head of the family or head of the state would do with limited sources.“Is it justified to invest Rs 1.09 lakh crore in one place and get nothing in return or spend a few crore on a developed city like Visakhapatnam and compete with the neighboring Hyderabad, Chennai and Bengaluru,” the CM asked.“Amaravati is neither close to Vijayawada nor Guntur. There is not even a single approach double lane road to Amaravati. With no infrastructure, no roads and no money, when will we be able to compete with Hyderabad or Bengaluru or Chennai,” he asked.“The Centre had given Rs 1,500 crore. There is another Rs 1.09 crore to provide basic infrastructure in 55,000 acres of land. The previous government had spent Rs 5,677 crore on Amaravati. How many years will it take at this rate to develop a city to compete with Hyderabad,” he asked.He justified his decision to have three capitals in the three regions and claimed the experiment would help in the development of the three regions. “It is a conscious decision taken to distribute the fruits of development to the three regions. If we don’t take such decisions, the future generations will not excuse us,” the chief minister said.On the introduction of English medium in government schools, the chief minister said the introduction of English medium was a revolutionary step in the 21st century.“These days, every parent is dreaming of giving English medium education to the child. Some parents are sending their children to private schools by paying more, while government schools are empty. The idea is to upgrade the schools to meet the needs of society and dreams of parents,” the chief minister said.He, however, said that the government had made Telugu a compulsory subject in all schools, including private ones, where Telugu is not a subject now.

NASHIK: After setting things in place for a smoother flow of traffic at the Dwarka junction on the Mumbai-Agra highway, the city police on Wednesday converted the twin service roads along the highway into one-ways near the Pathardi Phata to ease congestion at that junction.

The police said the Pathardi Phata junction also sees chaotic traffic situations during the morning and evening hours. This is because it is flanked by large residential and commercial complexes on all sides. Moreover, the Ambad industrial area is also along the junction. During the morning and evening hours, there is a huge rush of industrial workers and employees to and from their workplaces. Eight roads come together at the Pathardi Phata junction. The two-way traffic along the service roads adds to the chaos.

Over the past one-and-a-half decades, a large number of residential and commercial areas have come up on either side of the highway. According to the police, the situation becomes especially chaotic when the evening shift of the industries in Satpur and Ambad MIDCs get over and people return home.

That is why the police have made the service road from the Pathardi Phata junction (Hotel Santosh) to the underpass opposite hotel Taj a one-way towards Mumbai side. Similarly, the service road from the underpass till Pathardi Phata junction has also become a one-way for vehicles going towards the junction from the Mumbai side.

The one-way traffic rule will be in effect until the police come up with other notifications regarding the traffic at the junction. Police officials said the slew of measures taken by the police at Dwarka junction have borne results. The one-way system on the service roads at Pathardi Phata would also resolve the problem here.

RAJKOT: The lioness which is suspected to have killed the five-year-old boy near Rajula on Tuesday has been captured by the forest department at around midnight of Tuesday. The cubs are also with the lioness and the trio have been sent to a local animal rescue centre for further tests.

According to forest department officials, the lioness was captured at the same place where it had allegedly dragged the child. There was a team of 20 officials engaged in the capture activity. After being caged, the lioness managed to jump out of the ring cage, but being a mother of two cubs she couldn’t desert her offsprings who were inside the cage. The officials then tranquilized the animal with the help of a veterinary doctor.

Deputy conservator of forest, Shetrunji range, Sandeep Kumar said, “We will do scat analysis and other tests to confirm that this is the same lioness that had killed and also partly fed on the little boy.”

Kishor Devipujak, 5, was attacked by the lioness in the wee hours of Tuesday while he was sleeping in the open outside his hut in a farm on the railway track opposite Pipavav port. The lioness attacked the kid and dragged him for 3km before partially feeding on the body.

The incident happened sometime between 4am and 5am, 12 km from Rajula town. Kishore was sleeping in the open outside his hut in the farm, which is located along side a railway track that leads to the port. His parents work as farm labourers.

Forest officials suspect that the lioness may mistaken the boy to be some prey as she had killed a goat at the same place around two months ago. She was familiar with the people living around and couldn’t have been a man-eater.

162,['6/02/2020'],Dist farmers oppose land pooling for housing project,"This story is from February 6, 2020

Visakhapatnam: The ongoing land pooling process initiated by district officials is being met with opposition from farmers in various villages. The state government about 10 days ago released order no. 72 to pool 6,116 acres of land spread across 10 mandals of Visakhapatnam district to be distributed to the homeless and facilitate housing projects for weaker sections of the society.

Consequently, officials have started conducting village-level meetings, starting from January 29, to apprise farmers about the pooling initiative and get their nod. Even though some farmers are coming forward to part with their land, several farmers opposed the proposals during the meetings being conducted for the last one week. Even on Wednesday, the farmers of Nanginarapadu in Sabbavaram village unanimously resolved against the land pooling. Same was the situation in Sampathipuram in Anakapalli mandal on Wednesday where the farmers obstructed the meeting proceedings against the pooling. These 6,100 acre lands are primarily government lands and are enjoyed by the assignees and other tenants. As per the government order, the assignees will get 900 square yards developed land per an acre. But the encroachers or the enjoyers without any documents would only get 450 square yards or 250 square yards based on the duration of the possession of the land.

Speaking to ToI, K Ramana Rao, a farmer of Nidigattu village, said that they could eke out a bare living by cultivating the land for the last two decades. “We will be deprived of livelihood once the land is taken over by the government in the pooling. So that we have decided to fight against the pooling,” said Ramana Rao.

CPM state secretariat member Ch Narasinga Rao said that the poor peasants have been appealing to the government for years to issue them pattas for the lands under their possession for the last 20 years. “But the state government never did so in the name of urban agglomeration. Even after cultivating these lands for the last two to three decades, the poor peasants are now named as encroachers in the government order. The GO No 294 clearly mentioned that the arable land should not be a part of land pooling. But the state government skirted its own order and issued GO No 72 for the pooling. We demand the government to immediately revoke the order issued for pooling,” said Narasinga Rao.

However, the ruling YSRCP claim that the land pooling is being done only for distribution of housing sites to the homeless. YSRCP official spokesperson and Anakapalli MLA Gudivada Amarnath said that every cent of the pooled land will only go the weaker sections.

“The state government wants to make sure there is no homeless person in Andhra Pradesh. The pooled will only be distributed to eligible beneficiaries,” said Amarnath.

VIJAYAWADA: Chief minister YS Jaganmohan Reddy on Wednesday justified his plan to decentralize administration and establish three capitals by saying that it was the only practical approach to develop the state. He said he had chosen Visakhapatnam as the capital city because it has all the infrastructure and holds the potential to compete with big cities in south India. He, however, said Amaravati will continue to be the legislative `capital’.Speaking at a private programme here on Wednesday, the chief minister said Amaravati would require Rs 1.09 lakh crore for basic infrastructure while the government has no money to invest.“We need Rs 1.09 lakh crore to invest in Amaravati while the state’s capacity is only Rs 5,000 crore,” he said and wanted to know what any head of the family or head of the state would do with limited sources.“Is it justified to invest Rs 1.09 lakh crore in one place and get nothing in return or spend a few crore on a developed city like Visakhapatnam and compete with the neighboring Hyderabad, Chennai and Bengaluru,” the CM asked.“Amaravati is neither close to Vijayawada nor Guntur. There is not even a single approach double lane road to Amaravati. With no infrastructure, no roads and no money, when will we be able to compete with Hyderabad or Bengaluru or Chennai,” he asked.“The Centre had given Rs 1,500 crore. There is another Rs 1.09 crore to provide basic infrastructure in 55,000 acres of land. The previous government had spent Rs 5,677 crore on Amaravati. How many years will it take at this rate to develop a city to compete with Hyderabad,” he asked.He justified his decision to have three capitals in the three regions and claimed the experiment would help in the development of the three regions. “It is a conscious decision taken to distribute the fruits of development to the three regions. If we don’t take such decisions, the future generations will not excuse us,” the chief minister said.On the introduction of English medium in government schools, the chief minister said the introduction of English medium was a revolutionary step in the 21st century.“These days, every parent is dreaming of giving English medium education to the child. Some parents are sending their children to private schools by paying more, while government schools are empty. The idea is to upgrade the schools to meet the needs of society and dreams of parents,” the chief minister said.He, however, said that the government had made Telugu a compulsory subject in all schools, including private ones, where Telugu is not a subject now. He reiterated his government’s commitment to give English medium education to children and protect Telugu by making it compulsory in all schools.",vijayawada,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73974222,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-774118,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/jagan-justifies-the-decision-to-set-up-three-capital-cities/articleshow/73968818.cms

VISAKHAPATNAM: The Union Budget has allocated Rs 3 crore this year for the new Rayagada division, which is part of a project for the proposed South Coast Railway ( SCoR ) zone. The total sanctioned cost for the project is Rs 170 crores.

“This sanctioned amount is for the upcoming Rayagada division. However, we would ask for more during the August review estimates and then again during the final review estimate in January 2021. Till then, Rs 3 crore is not a small amount that can be spent,” said a senior railway official.

On July 17, 2019, the ministry of railways had approved the creation of a new railway zone known—South Coast Railway (SCoR)—with headquarters at Vishakhapatnam.

For Waltair division under the present East Coast Railway zone , the Budget has announced a Wagon POH workshop at an estimated cost of Rs 28 crore and augmenting the construction of a diesel loco shed at an estimated cost of Rs 11 crores.

The Budget has also cleared decks for constructing two new lines and doubling of four existing lines at Waltair division.

Andhra Pradesh high court

VIJAYAWADA: The Andhra Pradesh high court on Wednesday found fault with photographs of chief minister Y S Jaganmohan Reddy printed on the boards of Panchayat office across the state.

While hearing a public interest litigation (PIL) filed by Muppa Venkateswara Rao, the bench headed by Chief Justice J K Maheswari and Justice Ninala Jayasurya asked the government why chief minister’s photographs were displayed on hoardings at panchayat offices.

Assistant advocate general said the chief minister’s is a constitutional post and hence the hoardings.

The HC said: “The prime minister’s is a constitutional position, but can we display his photo in front of Parliament? Similarly, the chief justice is head of the Supreme Court but his photo is not displayed at the court entrance. The state government should follow the customs and spirit of the Constitution,” said the HC bench.

In an affidavit, the state government said the YSRC party flag and the colours used to paint panchayat offices were different. The HC said it could differentiate between the colours of the party flag and colours on the offices.

The HC directed the advocate general to present YSRC flag and the colours painted on the offices.

The state election commission said it cannot direct the government to remove party flag colours on panchayat office buildings as the model code of conduct was not in force.

The HC said that it would give directions if the EC did not have the necessary powers.

Further hearing will take place on Thursday.

Slum dwellers, along with former Congress MLA Raj Kumar, filed a complaint with DMC commissioner Vinay Shankar... Read More

DEHRADUN: The dwellers of slum settlements, especially those situated in Mehboob Colony and Sahastradhara Road, have alleged that land syndicates are trying to grab their land by posing as Dehradun Municipal Corporation ( DMC ) officials.

The residents of these settlements claimed they found the involvement of land mafias only after they went to the DMC office, along with former Congress MLA Raj Kumar and other party members, to ask the municipal corporation officials to withdraw the decision of “displacing us from our lands”.

However, after a discussion with municipal commissioner Vinay Shankar Pandey , they found out that the DMC never sent any official with any such order to these slums.

“Some land mafia goons, who run a real estate business, are harassing the slum dwellers of Dehradun. These people have been living here for 15-20 years. Residents of two slums located in the Mehboob Colony and Sahastradhara road have reported such harassment. The slum dwellers are confused whether the people who are fooling them are DMC officials or land mafia people. We have given a memorandum to the DMC commissioner and now, we will give it to the district magistrate, and to the SSP as well. It is a very serious matter,” said Kumar.

Usha Devi, resident of Sahastradhara Road slum settlement, told TOI, “We have all documents like Aadhar card, ration card etc. Also, we pay our house tax and are due to get ownership rights too. So, the officials can’t remove us from our lands. We don’t know if the people who are trying to remove us from our land are DMC officials or land mafia men.”

She said that discussion with DMC commissioner has brought a sense of relief for the slum residents.

“After listening to the commissioner, we feel that land mafia men have been harassing us so far. There are around 150 homes in the Sahastradhara road slum and the Mehboob Colony has more than 200 homes. It would be a really big problem if all of us are made homeless,” Usha Devi added.

Meanwhile, the DMC maintains that they never sent any team to the slums in question with any such controversial orders. “We will discuss the matter with the concerned official but we are confident that the municipal corporation has never sent its team to the two slums about which the locals are talking about. If the DMC team had gone over there, I would have known about it,” said Pandey.

Representative image

NASHIK: The ever-rising online-fraud cases doubled last year with 50 cases being registered with the Nashik cyber crime police station.

The criminals have been coming out with unique ways to cheat people of their hard-earned money. The police, on the other hand, have failed to cope up with the criminals as only three cases were detected last year.

Total worth of Rs one crore frauds were registered with the police station last year.

In 2018, close to 20 cases were reported by the police station as a mere two cases were solved by the cyber experts.

According to the police, the detection rate in such cases is very low because most of the times these criminals submit fake documents to open the bank account. And when police contact them they have got a fake address which results in disappointment.

Devraj Borse, senior PI of the cybercrime police station said, “During an investigation, we have found out that in most of the cases the banks have not verified the home addresses of the account holders. When we reach the address of the account holder, there is no trace of the latter at the said place.”

Further fake identification documents are submitted for creating bank accounts, all these things hinder the investigation process, said Borse.

The cyber police said that the maximum online frauds are about the victims getting phone calls from the fraudsters, who speak to the victims on the pretext of being bank officials. The cybercriminals after contacting their victim, take the details of the bank, debit or credit cards of the latter and ask them the OTP they receive on their cellphone. After getting the OTP, the cybercriminals transfer the amounts of the victims to their bank accounts to withdraw money.

PI Borse said that 80 percent of all the OTP related cases are from Jamtara, a district in Jharkhand. He said that cybercriminals from Jamtara have victimised people from almost all the states of the country including relatives of top film stars and government officials.

Borse added that most of the youths of villages of this district are into cheating people by calling the victims as bank officials and taking the bank or card details, OTPs and then removing the money from their bank account.

The cybercrime police officials said that they too have cases related to Jamtara. Borse said that they would prepare a full-proof plan to detect and catch the criminals in the Jharkand district.

172,['6/02/2020'],Chinese brands gain share in refurbished phone market,"This story is from February 6, 2020

Chennai: Chinese smartphone brands are on their way to consuming a lion’s share even in the refurbished and used-phones market as price-sensitive consumers are finding it a win-win to own a phone with high specifications at a reasonable price.

Mandeep Manocha, CEO and co-founder, Cashify says that the share of Xiaomi has gone up from 12%-15% to 25% in a span of 12-15 months on their platform.

“On the other hand, Motorola and Lenovo are seeing a drop in the share. Motorola is seeing a dip from 10% to a 5% and Lenovo’s share has also dropped,” he added.

As the life cycle of a smartphone comes down to 13-15 months from 18 months within a span of a year and half, and the price of refurbished models among Chinese brands such as Vivo, Oppo , Realme, Xiaomi and One Plus at Rs 5,000 to Rs 8,000 — as estimated by the re-commerce players — these brands seem to grow at 50%-60% in that space.

With prices along the lines of entry-level smartphones , but with better specifications and almost new — since these models are used for barely over a year — smartphone users from tier 2 or tier 3 cities are purchasing the Chinese brand models.

These players are also eating into the share of former famous brands such as Lenovo, Motorola, Karbonn and Lava, companies in the space add. “Those who migrate from a feature phone find these brands perfect, since the models aren’t too heavy on the pocket and also offer the transition to first time and entry-level users at better specifications and also come with a warranty,” said Rohit Bagaria, founder, Budli.in, an online portal which offers re-commerce of gadgets. Chinese brands have seen an increase from 40%-75% in the last 2 years, while Motorola and Lenovo saw their share being halved in the same period. Even as these phones are picked up by those upgrading from a feature phone to a smartphone, the premium category — Apple and high-end models of Samsung — have their share untouched at 25%, thanks to their existing smartphone customers who upgrade to a model with higher specifications. “There is a 30% growth in purchase of One Plus and Xiaomi phones but Apple and Samsung still maintain their user base. It is only the homegrown brands like Lava, Karbonn etc which are becoming less popular,” said Yogesh Bhatia the founder of PreLoved Device.

HYDERABAD: Researchers from Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Hyderabad have found a new molecule that could help in finding cure to Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), a rare neurodegenerative disorder that cripples the functioning of body muscles. About a lakh cases of ALS are reported in India and it gained popularity worldwide as it had affected eminent scientist and author Stephen Hawking . During 2014, ALS became a hot topic thanks to “ice bucket” challenge in different parts of the world.While Hawking overcame ALS through sheer determination and continued to postulate new theories for almost five decades, others affected by this genetic disorder remain paralysed for life.There is no known cure for ALS and the latest finding of the IIT Hyderabad team could open new vistas for a possible wonder drug. Apart from affecting the voluntary movement of muscles, ALS can cause paralysis and often death. ALS occurs when there is a change or mutation in certain genes. It is not clear what causes the genes to change but scientists blame it on factors ranging from environment to genetics and smoking to use of harmful chemicals in agriculture.The finding of the research was published in the recent issue of the leading scientific journal, International Journal of Biological Macromolecules. The research team included Dr Basant Kumar Patel, Dr Sandeep Singh and Dr Rajakumar Eerappa of the department of biotechnology and Prof Ganesan Prabushankar of the department of chemistry. Research scholars Amandeep Girdhar, Vidhya Bharathi, Vikas Ramyagya Tiwari, Suman Abhishek, Waghela Deeksha, Usha Saraswat Mahawar, and Gembali Raju were also part of the research study.Dr Basant Kumar Patel said one of the causes of ALS is the changes in the genes that are responsible for the manufacture of an important protein, TDP-43. Mutations in the genes lead to changes in the structure of this special protein. These changes in turn result in deposition of proteins on nerve cells. This leads to degeneration of nerves.According to an official statement of IIT Hyderabad, Dr Patel and Prof Prabushankar found a small molecule called ‘AIM4,’ which seemed to be better than the other related molecules that have been studied all around the world, in its ability to inhibit abnormal aggregation of TDP-43. The study was conducted in vitro (in laboratory) model. IIT Hyderabad scientists proceeded to analyse this molecule and study its action on TDP-43, to predict how it would potentially inhibit the deposition of the protein in nerve cells.The research group compared the ability of AIM4 with that of other molecules like Dimebon, an antihistamine studied for treatment of neurodegenerative disorders. Dimebon failed in clinical trials. AIM4 was found to be better than other such molecules.The IIT team said AIM4 is a promising drug for potential treatment of ALS. “This work is an important step forward in treatment of ALS as current options for ALS are minimal or even non-existent”, said Dr Patel.",hyderabad,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73975798,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-24408,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/iit-h-researchers-find-new-molecule-to-help-cure-als/articleshow/73970083.cms

NASHIK: The special squad of city police on Tuesday raided an illegal gas filling centre and seized 3 domestic gas and 14 commercial LPG cylinders along with 8 vehicles and other articles worth Rs 8.43 lakh.

One man was arrested from the spot and has been booked under relevant sections of Essential Commodities Act and The Liquefied Petroleum Gas (Regulation and Supply and Distribution) Order, 2000. The owner of the place could not be traced by police, but he too has been booked.

According to police, a complaint was received at the police commissionerate about the illegal den in Bhandure Mala area of Satpur. Working on the information, the special squad raided the place on Tuesday morning and found various customers who had come to get the LPG gas for their vehicles.

“One of the suspects filling LPG gas in vehicles was arrested from the spot. As many as 17 gas cylinders (3 domestic and 14 commercial), two electric machines used for filling gas in vehicles, a weighing machine, seven auto rickshaws and one car were also seized,” a police officer said.

“More people should come forward to inform about illegal activities happening in their areas. Response from the informers is vital as their name is not disclosed to anyone,” he added.

Over the past two months a large number of raids have been conducted by the special squad all over the city. The in-charge officers of the concerned police stations are held accountable for illegal business in their jurisdiction.

“Action is also taken against the concerned police officer if illegal dens are found operating in his jurisdiction repeatedly by the special squad,” the officer said.

Rajkot: Two persons committed suicide by jumping from high-rise buildings in Rajkot in the past 24 hours.

In the first case, Milan Mehta (55) jumped from the ninth floor of Neptune Tower on Kalawad Road on Tuesday evening. Mehta’s identity could only be ascertained from a diary found from his pocket.

“We called up different numbers mentioned in his diary and thus were able to identify him. Mehta was living alone in Vaniavadi locality of Rajkot. We are yet to probe the reason for his suicide,” said an official from Gandhigram police station.

The second case was reported from Pancheshwer Tower building on Sadhu Vasvani Road where Purvesh Vasoya (45) jumped from the third floor of Pancheshwer Tower on Wednesday morning. “Vasoya told his family members that he was going for a morning walk. Then he committed suicide. Vasoya’s family members rushed him to Rajkot Civil Hospital where he was declared brought dead. Our preliminary investigation suggests that Vasoya was passing through a financial crisis, which might have prompted him to take the drastic step,” said an official from University police station.

Vadodara: A sessions court here on Wednesday sentenced a 26-year-old man from Dabhoi to 10 years rigorous imprisonment (RI) for abduction and rape of a minor girl by luring her with marriage promise in December 2015.

The convict Rahul alias Dadu Thakor from Dabhoi had abducted the 17-year-old Class XII girl in December 2015 from her school in Gorwa after promising to marry her and took her to Dediyapada in Narmada district where he raped her.

Her abduction came to light when she did not return from school and her father too could not find her anywhere. While searching, the girl’s father came to know that Thakor had abducted his daughter following which he registered a case of kidnapping at Gorwa police station. Thakor and the girl had come in contact with each other when Thakor had come to live at his relative’s home which is in the girl’s neighbourhood.

The cops tracked down Thakor and the girl to Dediyapada in Narmada district and brought them back to Vadodara after 25 days. On returning, the girl told police that she had physical relations with Thakor and later he had refused to marry her. The girl’s medical tests also revealed that she had been raped and thus Thakor was also booked for rape.

During the trial, the girl and her family members among other witnesses were examined. Additional public prosecutor H R Joshi also submitted forensic and medical evidence against Thakor which were upheld by the court of additional sessions judge K M Sojitra. The court also fined Thakor Rs 13,000.

This is the third conviction within a week wherein the accused had lured a minor girl of marriage and abducted and raped her. On Tuesday too, the same court had convicted Ikram Shah alias Akram Dewan for a similar crime. Another man identified as Babu alias Bharat Vasava was sentenced to 10 years in jail on January 30 by another sessions court in city for abducting and raping a 14-year-old girl.

Visakhapatnam: Two persons were murdered by their family in two separate incidents in north Andhra Pradesh on Wednesday. The reasons for the murders are said to be family disputes and property disputes.

In the first incident, 40-year-old P Srinu was murdered by his brother and father following a fight between him and his family at Mushalipalem area under Makavarapalem Police Station limits in Vizag district. Police said Srinu was addicted to alcohol and had a few other vices leading to him being unemployed for a year. He used to pick up fights with his family members and others after consuming liquor. On Tuesday night, Srinu fought with his mother and father in an inebriated condition. Though Srinu’s brother Sunil Kumar tried to pacify him, the 40-year-old chased his mother with a stick to attack her.

Unable to bear the harassment, Srinu’s father Sunny Babu and his brother attacked Srinu with sticks. Srinu, who sustained injuries to his head, died on the spot. Police led by sub-inspector K Ramu registered a case.

In another incident, a 60-year-old-woman was murdered by her son at Ramadasupeta village under Tekkali Police Station limits in Srikakulam district. The deceased was identified as K Anasuyamma and the accused is K Ramakrishna. The police said Ramakrishna had fought with his mother over property. Since Anasuyamma was not in favour of giving land to Ramakrishna, he held a grudge on her and stabbed her.

HYDERABAD: A 22-year-old milk vendor, identified as Revanth Kumar , was allegedly hacked to death by four persons at Halia town in Nalgonda district on Wednesday. The police took all the accused into custody on Wednesday and preliminary investigation suggests that personal grudge was the motive behind the murder .

Revanth’s parents were the first ones to spot his body lying on the road between Halia and Hazarigudem and raise an alarm. Hearing them, locals rushed to the spot and called the police as well as an ambulance. However, Revanth was declared dead by the ambulance staff, said Nalgonda SP AV Ranganath.

Revanth had left home at 4.30am on his two-wheeler to collect milk from Hazarigudem village and his parents left five minutes later. On their way, they saw their son lying in a pool of blood, the police said, adding that his mother Indiramma said that a few persons who had borrowed money from them were behind the murder.

During probe, the police learnt that Revanth and Hari Krishna, a garment shop owner from Halia, were not on good terms as the latter suspected him of having an affair with his wife. As per the plan, Hari and three of his friends — Mahesh, Rajesh and Ganesh — attacked Revanth with an axe and he died on the spot, police said.

Cops are probing if Hari’s brother Satyanarayana, who had borrowed Rs 2 lakh from Indiramma, was involved in the murder.

NEW DELHI: K Parasaran, the 93-year-old Supreme Court lawyer who represented Hindu parties in the Ram Temple-Babri Masjid dispute, and his family could hardly contain their emotions on Wednesday as their three-storeyed house in Delhi’s Greater Kailash-1 was declared the office of the newly formed trust that would oversee the mandir’s construction on a 67-acre land in Ayodhya . “I’m just one of the trustees. There are others,” he smiled.

There are 15 trustees in all for the Ram Janmabhoomi Teerth Khsetra Trust. Parasaran’s lawyer son Mohan told TOI, “We are of course happy. But at the same time, it is a very onerous responsibility. My father has been involved in the Ayodhya matter since 1991. He, after deep thought, accepted this offer. The offer was made by the home ministry. With his experience, he will be able to manage the Trust aided by very able and distinguished trustees.” Even as Mohan spoke, Parasaran Sr went into a huddle with his team of lawyers as they discussed the upcoming hearing on the Sabarimala temple entry case that is listed in SC for Thursday. Their house, R 20 in Greater Kailash 1, buzzed with activity as his personal aide for 33 years, Muthuswami, answered the phone that rang relentlessly. Inside the house, framed photographs of Lord Ventakeshwara, Ram and Ganesha adorned the walls lined below by an extensive collection of law books and small plaques. Among them hung the Padma Bhushan citation that he received from then President A PJ Abdul Kalam in 2003. Mohan said the family would be happy to host meetings of the Trust at their house. “Meetings can be held here or in Ayodhya,” he said.

As several paramilitary and police personnel gathered on the road below, Mohan clarified that the security was not for his father. “He has never wanted security. He shunned security even he was attorney general in Tamil Nadu .” VHP functionaries, who had recently honoured Parasaran and 32 other lawyers involved in the case at a ceremony in Ayodhya, insisted they were not disappointed at being left out from the 15member trust.

“It (the group of trustees) is non-controversial. There is no disappointment. We are overwhelmed by this decision. Parasaran ji and his team members were honoured by us at a grand ceremony. We welcome the decision,” VHP vice-president Champat Rai told TOI.

Representative image

PIMPRI CHINCHWAD: The standing committee of the corporation on Wednesday decided to keep in abeyance the proposal for increasing the property tax largely because of the displeasure BJP was facing from residents over the decision to continue with the alternate day water supply.

The Pimpri Chinchwad civic administration’s proposal to increase the water tax for flats, tenements in slum rehabilitation projects and for slum dwellers for 2020-21 came up for discussion at the standing committee meeting on Wednesday. The proposal also sought approval for increasing the property tax by 5% every year thereafter.

Vilas Madigeri, the chairperson of the Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation ( PCMC ) standing committee, said, “We shall keep the proposal in abeyance until the citizens get adequate water supply at good pressure. The civic officials stated that they expected to get Rs180 crore from the tax hike and another Rs35 crore after increasing the water tax. I pointed out that the property tax department has completed the tax assessment of newly detected 7,500 properties and the work of conducting tax assessment of another 7,500 properties is in progress. The department will be able to get Rs150 crore from these newfound properties.”

Madigeri said the property tax department was facing manpower shortage while identifying non-assessed properties in the city. “So, we have told the municipal commissioner to provide more manpower by hiring people on contract for conducting this work. It will ensure that the annual property tax income of the civic body increases every year.”

The civic body decided to start alternate day water supply for two months from November 25 to ensure equitable and adequate water supply.

190,['6/02/2020'],Nagpur News - Times of India,"This story is from February 6, 2020

Infrastructure project announcements are never in short supply in the city — most of them grand enough to catch the eye. But the proof is in the pudding, and the recent Sadar flyover landing mess has highlighted the broad-as-daylight gap between project planning and successful execution. Panellists at the TOI Debate discuss how and why Nagpur’s project designs are incommensurate with ground reality

The demographics, underlying cultural strands and social issues of a city, must be at the heart of its project planning studies, believes architect Sapna Vastani. The way new projects shape up though makes one seriously doubt if these aspects are accorded any attention, she feels. Citing the example of areas like Manish Nagar, where hawker zones were not a part of the plan, she wonders why the powers-that-be do not learn from their mistakes.

Chartered accountant Nimish Sutaria finds many of the city’s original master plans astute but feels that their purpose is not well understood today, due to which they are being abused (encroachment of playgrounds being a case in point). “Why do we have so many hospitals in an already congested area like Dhantoli? Why aren’t we spreading out when we have enough space?” he says.

The prime stumbling block, responds former NMC chief engineer Prakash Urade, is the road width availability. “With no scope to increase the width of roads, we are often unable to accommodate plan revisions even if we want to,” says retired public works department (PWD) engineer Jeevan Nikose. The increasing floor space index (FSI) — which is a measure of the city’s population density — further compounds matters as the plan needs to be revised repeatedly to meet the changing needs.

Width is not the only thing that is wrong with roads. The levelling of newly-constructed cement roads is a big area of concern, as per Vastani. “We never experienced severe waterlogging in Nagpur earlier. The drainage system is not being properly looked into,” she says.

Vastani also finds the process of piling layer-after-layer on roads illogical when there is the option of building new roads instead. “It is not very easy to do that, as the soil erodibility factor (also known as the ‘K factor’) gets disturbed by it,” counters Urade.

Architect Priya Nair finds potholes to be a teething issue which affects the discharge rate of traffic, with haphazard management at busy intersections adding to the woes. “Junctions like Medical Square and Ram Nagar Square have traffic coming in from all four sides at once, causing utter chaos,” says businessman Yogesh Agrawal.

Projects keep getting greenlit with scarce planning for the small, key details, according to Sutaria. “There is no provision for last-mile connectivity. Public vehicles have no designated space for parking at the airport. Parking space is not available at any of the brand new Metro stations either,” he claims.

Nachiket Kaley, founder member of non-governmental organization (NGO) Civic Action Guild (CAG), agrees with Sutaria. “The planning occurs on a broad level. We do not work on the details. There is a lot of ambiguity in the minutiae of project implementation, since the documentation is often quite flawed,” says Kaley.

Businessman Saqib Parekh feels that there is no vision to assimilate rural and urban planning, and that the city needs short, five-year-long plans more than a 30-year vision statement for development to materialize. “Rural-urban coordination is conspicuous by its absence. Civic work is concurrently undertaken by different sets of employees, with scant regard for the big picture,” says Nikose.

Sutaria believes that there is a “multiplicity of cooks” that spoils many plans. Standard operating procedures are often found lacking, chimes in Kaley.

“The Japanese allocate 90% of the project time to planning, and 10% to execution. That is what makes the difference,” states Urade. “When a project is announced, it is not just the technical team’s prerogative to work on it. Everyone, including financers, architects and hawkers need to be involved in it,” he says.

The need for connecting projects to people finds the panel’s consensus. “Planners need to make projects people-friendly,” says Nikose. Nair feels that taking feedback from common people before going ahead with the project is necessary.

“The problem needs to be discussed holistically. Pressure groups can be instrumental in driving attention towards critical issues,” Urade adds.

Managing inputs from so many stakeholders, however, comes with its own challenges. “All engineers and planners come with their own perceptions, which may not align with those of others,” says Agrawal. To add to that, change is “very drastic” in today’s times, as per Nikose, which makes it tough for engineers to stay abreast.

A solution to that could be taking up project work in patches, suggests Kaley. “This would ensure that even if the scale of a project is small, it is done well,” he explains.

The panel also has some solutions for the Sadar flyover landing mess, which includes signalling and surveillance at the flyover, with traffic police personnel to man it at all times.

Not everyone agrees with these propositions. “What is the use of a flyover if one needs to halt in between?” says Sutaria. “The flyover should be permanently divided with a non-rigid divider,” he suggests.

Vastani wants efficient routing of traffic and signage to be put up at Sadar flyover. “There should be comprehensive risk analysis of the project, after which the process of ideation should commence,” Urade signs off.

NASHIK: The leader of opposition in the Nashik Municipal Corporation, Ajay Boraste, slammed the BJP for its move to seek Rs 150 crore loan allegedly for land acquisition , though the charges were denied by standing committee president Uddhav Nimse.

Boraste, of Shiv Sena, addressing the press today, said that the BJP was using the corporation funds in the interest of selected builders and developers by paying the sum for land acquisition.

“When the acquisition of land since 1993 was still pending, it is hard to understand why BJP is acting in haste to arrange the funds to clear the dues of the people whose land is to be acquired as per the 2017-development plan,” said Boraste.

Boraste said that the issues – related to the roads, electricity and water supply were taking back seats and the BJP were allegedly not interested in resolving the issues despite the former chief minister Devendra Fadnavis adopting the city when he was in the chair.

The mayor of Nashik city Satish Kulkarni and the NMC standing committee president Uddhav Nimse both denied the charges levelled against them.

Kulkarni said, “The loan was being taken for the developmental activities including the construction of ring roads, water supply and other roads. This is in tune with the demands and there is no harm in opting for the same.”

Nimse said that the NMC was taking the loan for the developmental activities and it had nothing to do with the charges made by the opposition. “The NMC has to carry out developmental activities and pay for the land acquisition. All the works are being carried out as per the priority list and there is no question of favouring anybody,” he said

Visakhapatnam: The state government has dumped rythu bazars with rotten onions it procured from National Agricultural Cooperative Market Federation of India (Nafed) to sell at subsidized rates during the crisis period.

What’s more, with no potential customers, a section of shopkeepers are selling them to a few small restaurants in the city.

“On February 2 and 3 we got a huge load of onions. But they are rotten, stink and have begun sprouting. Customers are not interested in buying the onions and we don’t have the option of returning them to the government. We are in a spot of bother,” said Jagadeshwar Rao, a shopkeeper. On Wednesday, when TOI visited the rythu bazar in Pedda Waltair, a couple of buyers were spotted buying the onions in bulk. Shopkeepers said they were from food joints nearby.

“On the last two days, we received at least 5,000 kg of onions which were mostly rotten. Bigger rythu bazars have received such onions in much bigger quantities. We are selling them at Rs 20 per kg,” said KM Rao, another shopkeeper.

But how come such a large stock of onions procured during the crisis period is still with the government? Officials with the agricultural and marketing departments have different answers.

A section of officials claimed they were rationing subsidised onions so that they could use it for a longer period as they were not sure how long the crisis would last. “The crisis got over mid-January and we are still we are left with onions procured from Nafed,” an official said.

Another section said the central government sent the consignments only mid-January when the crisis was almost over.

“Since we asked for it, we cannot return the onions. These onions are not of good quality and now that the crisis is over, people are buying Kurnool variety available in the market,” another official told TOI.

Doctors TOI spoke to said whatever might be the reason, selling rotten onions is not a good idea as it can cause severe ailments. “If it smells it means there’s bacteria. Eating such onions might cause severe food poisoning. Be careful, a jaundice epidemic broke out in the USA recently through onions,” said, Surya Rao, a physician.

193,['6/02/2020'],VMC to shell out more for land compensation,"This story is from February 6, 2020

Vadodara: The Vadodara Municipal Corporation (VMC) will have to recompense for the land it used for road widening near Shastri Bridge by paying the land owners interest higher than the actual value of land.

The civic body had widened the road without acquiring the land leading to litigations in the Gujarat high court. VMC had used 487.92sqm land near the Shastri Bridge to widen the road going towards Navayard. After the land owners were not compensated for the land, they approached the Gujarat high court with a series of petitions since 2004. However, these pleas were either rejected or withdrawn by the petitioners themselves.

The matter was eventually decided in 2008 by the HC stating that owners have to be compensated according to the value decided by the valuation committee. Those who lost land were also to be given interest from March 3, 1999.

According to a proposal prepared by the VMC administration, the value of the land at a rate of Rs 8,000 per square metre stood at Rs 39.03 lakh. Along with this, VMC would have to pay an interest of Rs 40.66 lakh. The civic body will have to pay Rs 79.69 lakh for the land now. The proposal does not give any clarity regarding the reasons for the delay in disbursing the compensation earlier to avoid interest.

The issue will be discussed in the standing committee later this week.

194,['6/02/2020'],Public feedback sought to upgrade rythu bazaars,"This story is from February 6, 2020

Visakhapatnam: Facilities at rythu bazaars in the city are likely to get a facelift soon as officials of the agriculture and horticulture departments chalk out plans to collect feedback from consumers. A majority of the 13 rythu bazaars in the city were set up around two decades ago by the Telugu Desam Party (TDP). Between 20,000 to 25,000 people visit the rythu bazaars every day and 7,000 to 10,000 quintals of vegetables are sold in a day.

In spite of the bulk quantity of produce sold at rythu bazaars, consumers complained that vegetables and fruits of poor quality were being sold. Most rythu bazaars also lack adequate parking space and traffic congestion in front of the bazaars is common, said Srinivasa Reddy, a resident of MVP Colony. Officials should examine the quality of vegetables before they are sold to consumers as pesticide use in vegetables has been increasing in the region, he added.

D Sudhakar, a resident of Pedda Waltair, said while prices of fruits and vegetables at rythu bazaars are 20 per cent cheaper than in other retail markets, the quality is poorer. Waste disposal, provision of drinking water for consumers, toilets and parking are also concerns, said consumers, adding that collecting feedback could help improve quality of services.

Representative image

PUNE: The proprietor of a finance company was arrested from his Greater Noida residence on the charge of duping 148 people from the city of over Rs 34 lakh on the promise of offering them loan since February 15, 2019.

A cybercrime police team under inspector Santosh Barge took Raoushan Kumar (44) into custody on February 1. He was produced before a local court there on February 2 and then brought to the city on transit police custody remand for conducting investigations. He will remain in police custody till February 8.

Searches at Kumar’s residence led to the seizure of a laptop, three cellphone handsets, 10 debit cards, nine chequebooks, two bank passbooks, stamp and documents of people applying for loan.

Kumar was arrested following an FIR registered by Phursungi businessman Gorakh Sapkal (36) with the cybercrime police on October 10, 2019.

Sapkal in his FIR said he was into the business of helping people to get loans from banks and financial firms. He stated that Kumar obtained his cell number from an online service provider and contacted him. Kumar offered him to work as an agent in Pune and induced him to direct clients to the latter in need of loan on a commission basis.

The FIR read Sapkal gave Kumar data of 148 people, including himself, in need of loan. Kumar then asked them to deposit varying charges for seeking loan.

Sapkal later realised that he was tricked after Kumar failed to honour his commitment of disbursing loan to the people. After the aggrieved people started making rounds of his office, he filed the complaint against Kumar.

A cyber police officer said investigations revealed that Kumar had registered his firm but did not open an office. He had created a website in the company’s name.

PUNE: A 29-year-old man was found dead in the bathroom of his flat in Kothrud late on Tuesday evening in a suspected case of suffocation due to gas geyser.Senior inspector Pratibha Joshi of the Kothrud police told TOI that the man, Ramraje Kishor Sankpal, might have died about four days ago. His post-mortem was conducted at the Sassoon General Hospital on Tuesday, primary report of which stated that he died due to suffocation, Joshi said.The case came to light after a foul smell started emanating from the flat, prompting the local residents to alert the police. After receiving the alert, the police and fire brigade officials rushed to the society at Sangam Chowk in Kothrud and broke open the entrance door of the flat.Upon inspection, it was found that the smell was coming from the bathroom, after which the police as well as the firemen broke open the bathroom door to find Sankpal lying motionless on the floor.Senior inspector Joshi said Sankpal’s bathroom had an LPG-operated geyser. “The bathroom’s window was closed,” she said, adding that Sankpal might have died due to suffocation after inhaling toxic fumes from the gas geyser .“If the bathroom would have had a proper exhaust, the death could have been avoided,” the officer said, adding a case of accidental death (AD) has been registered in this regard.Joshi said Sankpal used to give private tuitions to school students in his flat. “He used to stay alone in the flat,” she said. In this regard she also added that gas geysers emit harmful carbon monoxide.Police probe has revealed that Sankpal’s students visited the flat in the evening hours but found the front door shut from inside. “They rang the door bell few times and left without alerting the local residents,” an officer of the Kothrud police said.The gas geysers have emerged as a health hazard in India in the last one decade, experts said. “Many people have visited hospitals with the neurological effects, the after effect of keeping the gas geysers switched on in stuffy bathrooms. The gas geysers are popular as they are cheaper than electricity operated geysers,” an expert said.He said the carbon monoxide caused due to incomplete combustion of LPG in geysers can lead to neurological effects after prolonged use. “Mild dizziness, vomiting, headache and blackouts are some of the symptoms. The gas geyser syndrome cannot be even diagnosed as the blood tests, ECG EEG, MRO are normal.

Vadodara: Technology Teachers Forum (TTF) of M S University’s Faculty of Technology and Engineering (FTE) has demanded removal of the faculty’s dean with immediate effect.

According to TTF, MSU’s syndicate members have passed several resolutions stating that no teacher against whom an inquiry is going on and pending in court, may be given any statutory position like head of department or dean of faculty.

“Since you are functioning as FTE dean from science stream in engineering faculty, your eligibility as per the All India Council for Technical Education or National Board of Accreditation (NBA) is not as per the acts. This case is already pending in the court,” Dr K V R Murthy, TTF president has stated in representation submitted to MSU officials, a copy of which has been addressed to FTE dean Dr Arun Pratap. “Hence you are avoiding to apply for NBA which is mandatory requirement for the National Institute Ranking Framework. This also blocks chances of students who are going for higher education abroad,” Murthy has claimed.

TTF has alleged that FTE dean has not forwarded 20 applications of teachers due to which the teachers are not getting opportunity of promotion. “Considering our request, the department of technical education of Gujarat government had sent the letter for grade pay movement in October 2019 and you are still sleeping on these applications,” the memorandum states.

Differences between VUDA and SSNNL is the reason for delay

Vadodara: The construction of a key road providing connectivity to Bhayli and other areas on the city’s outskirts has not moved an inch due to differences between the Vadodara Urban Development Authority (VUDA) and the Sardar Sarovar Narmada Nigam Ltd (SSNNL).

VUDA has been demanding that the SSNNL should construct a siphon to allow a 30 metre town planning road over the Gokhana distributary canal of the Narmada project. SSNNL on the other hand wants VUDA to construct a bridge over the canal.

VUDA and SSNNL have been exchanging letters regarding the issue since 2016. VUDA wrote to the SNNL asking it to make the siphon in 2016 and, in reply, the SSNNL asked VUDA to deposit the processing fees of Rs 10,000 and the town planning scheme map for the area. VUDA completed the formalities.

But in 2018, SSNNL asked VUDA to consider making the bridge and get a detailed project report prepared for the same. VUDA got the report prepared by a consultant. It came to light that due to the height of the canal and roads running parallel to it, the bridge will be a costly affair and an estimate of Rs 55.75crore was prepared.

In 2019, VUDA again wrote to SSNNL stating that the bridge was not feasible and the suggestion of a siphon in the canal should be considered. In response, SSNNL stated in January this year that the proposal could not be accepted and bridge should be made at the site.

A letter by VUDA to SSNNL mentions all the details of the previous conversations and also states that the possibility of the bridge was examined again and this time it transpired that it would have a very steep slope.

Dabhoi MLA Shailesh Mehta, who has been raising the issue since quite some time now, said that he had discussed the issue with VUDA and in the coordination meetings of the district administration too. “I have apprised minister of state for Narmada and urban housing Yogesh Patel too about the situation and has also taken up the matter,” he said.

Patel said that he was shown the letter written by VUDA to the SSNNL. “I have asked officials to examine the possibility as per the procedures and provisions. VUDA is willing to spend for the project,” said Patel.

202,['6/02/2020'],2 Genome Valley cos face NCLT action after defaulting on payments,"This story is from February 6, 2020

Hyderabad: The National Company Law Tribunal ( NCLT ), Hyderabad, has admitted pleas against two firms in Shamirpet mandal’s Genome Valley in Turkapally and ordered corporate insolvency resolution process (CIRP) against them for defaulting on payments.

The two firms, MN Bio-technology Private Ltd and MN Takshila Industries Private Limited, were accused of default by Delhi-based Cerestra Advisors Private Ltd. A bench of member (judicial) Ratakonda Murali and member (technical) Narender Kumar Bhola pronounced two separate orders after hearing the pleas of Cerestra. It appointed Kranthi Kumar Kedari as insolvency professional to commence CIRP against the two firms.

While MN Bio-technology had failed to clear an advisory fee of Rs 51 lakh to Cerestra, payment of Rs 4.67 crore was due from Takshila for services it had availed from Cerestra, a ‘real assets’ focussed private equity firm.

Takshila had argued that a Singapore-based fund manager firm had availed itself of services from Cerestra and that there was no creditor-debtor relationship between it and Cerestra. The bench however ruled against it after going through the records. It said invoices were raised in the name of MN company and even TDS was deducted by it under section 194J of the Income Tax Act. The bench concluded that MN company availed services from Cerestra and was trying to evade its responsibility by blaming a third-party.

“TDS was deducted in connection with an invoice which was not in dispute,” the bench said. The amount deducted as TDS was directly connected to the invoice which was raised in connection with the services availed by MN company. “Since there was no other transaction between MN and Cerestra, this TDS will show us that Cerestra’s claims are correct,” the bench contended.

It admitted the insolvency plea against Takshila and MN Bio-technology under Section 9 of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016. The bench also declared a moratorium from February 4, 2020.

PUNE: Planning to gift roses to the loved ones this Valentine’s Day? Well, think again as you might have to shell out Rs 30-40 per piece as against the usual Rs 8-15 — a sharp 167-275% hike.A surge in rose prices is likely owing to a shortage of their supply in the market.Praveen Sharma, president, Indian Society of Floriculture Professionals, Talegaon Dabhade, said, “We have plenty of wedding ‘muhurats’ from February 16 to 28, which will put more pressure on supply and will result in a higher price of roses on Valentine’s Day. In January, this year, cut roses were being sold at Rs150 to 200 a bunch (of 20) in the wholesale market. During the Valentine’s Day period, we expect this to price to rise to Rs300 to 400 per bunch, which translates to approximately Rs30-40 per rose in the retail market.”Sharda Bajaj, proprietor of a flower retail outlet Life in Colour said, retail prices last year, during the same period, were the same at Rs30-40 per rose.“There are many weddings this February and rose exports are likely to continue till February 10-11. Even if the domestic demand remains the same, there is a possibility of a rise in retail price due to shortage in supply since a lot of roses are exported,” said Sharma.Bajaj said due to changing climatic conditions, production of roses has fallen this year but she would still retail roses at Rs30 per rose this V-Day.“This price used to be Rs20 a couple of years ago but now Rs30 per rose is the regular retail price,” said Bajaj.Ranvijay Singh Sisodia, another florist in Kalyaninagar, said, “Two years ago, bookings for bouquets for V-Day would start by this time, but we do not have a single order or enquiry to pre-book a bouquet for this V-Day.

PUNE: The cybercrime police on Tuesday arrested two men on the charge of uploading a video depicting child pornography on a website in April last year.

After tracking the Internet Protocol (IP) address of the cellphone, which was used to upload the video clip, police arrested Raj Kiran Pattilal (24) of Guruwar Peth and Manojkumar Zallar Saroj (19) of Raviwar Peth.

The police found the link to the clip on Monday and started looking into it. They took suo motu cognisance of the clip and filed the case, first such in Pune after a Union government order. The case has been registered with the Khadak police station.

Around a month ago, the Union government traced 35,000 videos depicting child pornography on various websites. The government followed up on this finding by ordering every state government to take action against people involved in uploading or sharing child pornography, the cybercrime police said.

Prima facie probe revealed that almost 150 links or video clips related to child pornography were uploaded from Pune in the past one to one-and-a-half years.

Senior police inspector Jayram Paygude of the cybercrime police station told TOI, “School dropouts Pattilal and Saroj were employed at a utensil shop in Raviwar Peth. The duo had uploaded the video clip on a website from the shop in their free time. The two men did not create the video, they obtained it from someone else.”

In a similar case, the Wakad police on Tuesday booked a man for uploading pornographic videos of women and children on a social media site.

The identity of the man has not been established yet. However, the police have launched a manhunt.

The Wakad police said the man uploaded 20-25 pornographic videos on the site through his profile in a span of six months. The videos went viral within days, the police said.

The police have invoked provisions of the Information Technology (IT) Act and the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act against the man.

The police have warned people against uploading videos related to child pornography on the Internet and sending it through Internet-based mobile messaging applications.

Anyone found in possession of digital or even computer-generated sexually explicit images that appear to depict a child will have to face punishment, as per the provisions proposed in the Protection of Children Against Sexual Offences Amendment Bill that was approved by the Union Cabinet on July 10, 2019.

The nayayalayas would also be set up in the erstwhile districts of Karimnagar, Nalgonda, Warangal, Khammam, Adilabad, Rangareddy, Mahbubnagar and Medak.The Parliament in 2008 had passed a law for setting up gram nyayalayas to enable citizens access the judicial network at the doorstep, especially at the grass roots level, and ensure socio-economic factors do not stand as an impediment for seeking justice.Telangana law secretary Santosh Reddy told TOI that the state government has completed the exercise of financial sanction for the staff of village courts and were sending the file to the high court that would set up the nyayalayas to be headed by a junior civil judge.On the Supreme Court imposing a penalty of Rs 1 lakh on the Telangana government for its delay in filing a counter in the apex court in connection with the setting up of gram nyayalayas, Santosh Reddy said they were appealing in the apex court to exempt the state from the penalty by submitting the reasons for the delay. “There was some sort of communication gap because of which the delay occurred,” he said.The Supreme Court had a few days ago pulled up several states and Union Territories for failing to set up gram nyayalayas. A bench, headed by Justice N V Ramana, had imposed a fine of Rs 1 lakh on Telangana, Assam, Chandigarh, Gujarat, Haryana, Odisha, Punjab and West Bengal for not filing their responses.The court also further instructed these states and Union territories to notify the court about setting up gram nyayalayas within a month.",hyderabad,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73976311,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-781624,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/t-racing-against-time-to-set-up-gram-nyayalayas/articleshow/73968896.cms
208,['6/02/2020'],"Respond on contradictions in animal transportation rules, HC tells Centre, Telangana government","This story is from February 6, 2020

Representative image

HYDERABAD: The Telangana high court on Wednesday sought answers from the state and Centre on contradictions in the rules framed by them on transportation of animals.

A bench of Chief Justice Raghavendra Singh Chauhan and Justice A Abhishek Reddy was hearing two separate pleas filed by Confederation of Indian Farmers’ Associations (CIFA) and All India Jamiatul Quresh Action Committee which questioned the anomalies in the rules. The bench sought counters from both Telangana and the Centre and posted the case to March.

When the CJ pointed out that the rules were only meant to secure safe transportation of animals, K Vivek Reddy, counsel for CIFA, said the Centre’s rules were slightly liberal while the state’s rules were rigid. Pointing out to contradictions between them, Vivek said: “The state’s rules are burdensome for small farmers.”

Rule 125-E of the Central Motor Vehicles Rules, 1989, was brought in by the central government in 2015 and notified in 2017. However, rule 253 of the Telangana Motor Vehicles Rules, 1989, imposed certain restrictions on transportation of animals. The rules made it mandatory for farmers to have specified vehicles and small vehicles like tempos cannot be used to transport animals. Also, vehicles transporting animals should not be open-ended. An attendant should be deployed with each vehicle and curbs were also imposed on number of animals that could be transported.

The Telangana government issued a memo on December 7, 2019, making it mandatory for farmers and traders to follow these rules. Appearing for CIFA, which has 30,000 small farmers as its members, Vivek said these rules would practically wipe out small farmers who transport five to six sheep or cattle to nearest village markets.

To this, the CJ said: “These rules are not prohibiting transport of animals. They (government) are only specifying the size of the contingent. All they are saying is that no discomfort should be caused to animals which are being transported. Comfortable space should be provided to them during transit time. What is wrong in it?”

However, Vivek said it was not correct for governments to insert animal welfare rules in the Motor Vehicles Act. Upon a query from the bench, assistant solicitor general Namavarapu Rajeswara Rao said he would obtain a counter from the Union ministry of road transport and highways.

The Quresh committee in its plea described the central and state rules as unconstitutional, depriving a large number of small traders and farmers of their right to work. “The entire meat industry will suffer if these new rules are implemented. Only big market players will be able to remain in the fray,” the committee said.

“We had to remove his left eye as it was badly damaged. He has suffered multiple injuries, including on the scalp and in the abdomen. He has been shifted to the general ward from the intensive care unit,” Noble Hospital medical director Dilip Mane told TOI.

The three arrested men, Yogesh Hanmate (24) from Solapur, and Ritesh Jadhav (21) and Avinash Gaikwad (22) from Keshavnagar, have been remanded in police custody till Saturday.

Wankhede was riding pillion on the motorcycle of his civil engineer friend Akshay Jadhav (24), also from Aurangabad. They were heading towards the new Hadapsar bridge via Mundhwa chowk.

Assistant inspector Prasad Lonare of the Hadapsar police station said, “As they reached the chowk, Wankhede chided the driver of a car for staying too close to their motorcycle. Angered at this, the car driver chased the motorcycle over 1.5km and intercepted it near a hotel at Hadapsar. The driver and the three occupants of the car attacked Wankhede with sharp weapons before speeding off. Jadhav rushed Wankhede to hospital and registered an FIR.”

Lonare said, “Jadhav had not noted down the car’s registration number but told us that the vehicle bore a Maharashtra State logo. A police team under senior inspector Ramesh Sathe and inspector Humraj Kumbhar checked CCTV cameras in the area and identified the routes used by the assailants. They zeroed in on the car and arrested the three men.”

“Investigations have revealed that Hanmate and Jadhav grabbed hold of Wankhede while Gaikwad and the absconding assailant attacked him with sharp weapons. Wankhede and Jadhav had come to Pune searching for jobs and are currently staying at Handewadi,” Lonare said.

The Hadapsar police have registered an offence under sections 307 (attempted murder), 325 and 326 (voluntarily causing grievous hurt with deadly weapons) and 34 (common intention) of the Indian Penal Code against the assailants. “Hanmate and Gaikwad work as cab drivers while Jadhav has studied up to standard XII and is currently unemployed,” the police said.

PUNE: A proposal for construction of a reinforced cement concrete (RCC) base in the Bhairoba nullah to overcome accumulation of silt, which leads to hindering of the flow of water in the natural stream, has been approved.The Principal Directorate of Defence Estates (PDDE) of the Southern Command gave its nod after the Pune Cantonment Board sent its proposal last November.“After studying the project, the PDDE has approved the proposal and forwarded it to the Director General Defence Estates (DGDE) in New Delhi for a final sanction,” chief executive officer of PCB Amit Kumar told TOI. Work is expected to commence after the DGDE’s final sanction.The project is crucial for the cantonment which witnessed a flood when the nullah overran its banks a couple of times during last monsoon.Over the years, the nullah has become a dumping ground for housing societies which also release their sewage into the stream. A huge amount of plastic and other waste choke the nullah, cantonment authorities said.“We have decided to implement the project in four phases. In the first phase, we will focus on the area between Ganga Satellite Society in Wanowrie and Fatimanagar. The total cost of the project is Rs 84 crore. The current proposal is for the first phase work and will require Rs 22 crore,” Kumar added.The directorate took over two months to survey the stream. “Our endeavour is to begin the work and finish the first phase before the monsoon,” Kumar added.A PCB member, who did not wish to be named, said, “The DGDE will again scrutinise the project before submitting it to the Ministry of Defence for funds. Often, the ministry has queries on the proposal and the whole process becomes time-consuming. The directorate had cleared the project earlier.”A senior official from the directorate told TOI, “In this case, since it is A-1 defence land, the army authorities took extra time to complete their scrutiny and gave an in-principle approval for the project.”The ministry may take a few weeks to sanction the budget. The board will have to float a tender, finalise the agency, award the work and start it at the site. “The board needs at least two to three months and by then the monsoon will begin,” another board member said.",pune,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73975478,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-668198,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/bhairoba-nullah-concreting-in-pcb-area-awaits-final-nod/articleshow/73970205.cms

NASHIK: The district administration has prepared a list of over 1.5 lakh farmers who would get benefits of the crop loan waiver scheme announced by the state government.

The Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government has announced Mahatma Jyotirao Phule Farmers Loan Waiver scheme in which farmers whose total loan outstanding is less than Rs 2 lakh will get benefitted.

“In the district we have 1.52 lakh farmers, who have taken loans from cooperative, nationalised and private banks, and fall in the criteria announced by the state government. The total loan taken by them is Rs 1,560 crore,” a district administration official said.

According to him, around 1.05 lakh farmers have taken a loan of Rs 990 crore from the Nashik District Central Cooperative (NDCC) bank, while 37,645 have taken loan of Rs 473 crore from the nationalized and other financial institutions and their outstanding is under Rs 2 lakh.

At the same time, there are 9,158 farmers who own vineyards and have taken the loan of Rs 97 crore. According to the government resolution all these people qualify for the loans. However the administration is now trying to figure out how many of the farmers have more than one account and also if the account loan value exceeds Rs 2 lakh.

“If a farmer has two or more accounts with banks and if the loans taken in case of all such accounts are over Rs 2 lakh, the farmer will be disqualified. The process of finding such farmers is being carried out and we expect the number is not more than 10%,” the official said.

He added that there are 1.12 lakh farmers who have cleared their dues worth Rs 1,453 crore already and at the same time there were 32,390 farmers who owed Rs 1,183 crore to financial institutions and whose loan amount exceeds Rs 2 lakh.

“Details of the exact numbers of beneficiary would be known only after the exercise of amalgamation of the accounts of the farmers was completed,” the official said.

Kuldip Singh

PUNE: New director of the city airport Kuldip Singh on Wednesday said he would talk to all stakeholders to identify the reasons behind the drop in the number of flight movements and passengers at the facility.

He said proper data on the load factor of the discontinued flights and the overall data available with the travel agents, airlines and hotels would be studied to know the technical reasons and find solutions.

After assuming charge, Singh said the fact that the Lohegaon airport was an Indian Air Force base must be respected for the sake of national security. “In any defence airport, which is also a civil enclave, the issue of slots remains. I plan to talk with all stakeholders so that a roadmap can be prepared,” Singh told TOI.

“As far as passenger facilities are concerned, a shed — from the arrival to parking number-2 (the pick-up point now) — will come up before monsoon this year,” he said.

Singh has been appointed the Pune airport director in challenging times.

Prashant Girbane, the director-general of the Mahratta Chamber of Commerce, Industries and Agriculture (MCCIA), stressed on the need for setting up a cargo terminal. Former director-general of MCCIA Anant Sardeshmukh said, “The main challenge of the new director will be runway extension and decongestion of traffic around the airport. Another task would be to re-establish and expand the airport’s link with international destinations.”

Singh said the issue of international connections from Pune would be looked into.

Aviation analyst and expert Dhairyashil Vandekar said, “There were issues regarding heavy penalty for parking. The director should do away with such rules.”

As per the data, the average night temperature in south peninsular India in January 2020 was the warmest in over 80 years since 1938, 1.3 degrees above the normal, an IMD official said.The average January temperature in this geographical region was 26.3 degrees C, 1.02 degrees higher than the normal average here and the highest since 1901, beating January 2016, the warmest ever for the region. The data also showed that south India recorded its second warmest ever December in 2019.Arvind Kumar Srivastava, head of the Climate Research Division (Climate Research and Services) IMD-Pune, said December 2019 had the warmest night temperatures since 1901 in at least five cities of Maharashtra — Pune, Ratnagiri, Malegaon, Kolhapur and Dahanu. January 2020 had similar trends for south peninsular India, he added.“Climatologically, we have noticed a trend that when north India is cool during the season, south India tends to record relatively warmer minimum temperatures,” he said.As per IMD, south peninsular India includes five subdivisions of coastal Andhra Pradesh, Rayalaseema, Tamil Nadu and Puducherry, south interior Karnataka and Kerala.“We have noticed a significant amount of moisture and humidity during this winter season in parts of central India as well as peninsular India via the wind regime that persisted almost constantly. These winds were either the moist westerlies blowing form the Arabian Sea or warm and humid easterlies blowing from the Bay of Bengal. As these winds were blowing from the sea regions, they carried moisture,” Srivastava said.Humid winds tend to keep night temperatures up, and are exactly the opposite in nature to the cold, northerly winds that blow from the snow-capped regions of the Himalayas and cause a plunge in temperatures.Srivastava said while parts of central India, including Maharashtra as well as south peninsular India were on and off under the influence of warm, moist winds, the anticyclones from the Arabian Sea continued to block the flow of northerly winds into these regions. “Had the northerly winds reached these regions often during winter this year, then January 2020 would not have been this warm,” he said.The high average temperature (average of maximum and minimum temperatures) in south peninsular India in January this year was a contribution from both, the high maximum or day temperatures here as well as the high minimum or night temperatures during the month.",pune,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73980062,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-234896,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/avg-jan-night-temp-in-parts-of-india-highest-since-1938/articleshow/73970217.cms

TRS did not show earnings: Revanth

HYDERABAD: The Income Tax department has issued notices to senior TRS leaders , including ministers, who had in 2017 collected lakhs of rupees doing petty jobs as part of a fund-raiser.On April 27, 2017, the leaders, including ministers K T Rama Rao , T Harish Rao and former MP Kalvakuntla Kavitha among others, had symbolically sold ice cream, lifted gunny bags as porters, delivered lectures in colleges and sold sarees, and in the process received donations. The money was used for the TRS foundation day celebrations at Warangal.While TRS leaders say that all activities as part of the fundraiser were transparent and no law was broken, Congress Malkajgiri MP A Revanth Reddy, who is the complainant in the case, has a different view.“The rules state that ministers, who are paid salaries, shall not earn money by performing other tasks,” Revanth told TOI. “The Labour Act defines minimum wages for coolies. In that case, how were TRS leaders paid lakhs for lifting a gunny bag? This is a clear case of quid pro quo where businessmen, realtors, hoteliers and hospital owners paid huge sums as bribes to public representatives.”Revanth, who was TDP’s working president in Telangana when the complaint was filed, alleged, “KT Rama Rao sold ice cream to Malla Reddy who runs educational institutions. Many of these institutions have complaints pending with the municipal department for building violations, property tax default and agricultural land being used for non-agricultural purposes. Besides, according to ACB rules, undervaluation or overvaluation of work amounts to a bribe.”Former MP and state planning board vice-chairman B Vinod Kumar said, “Income Tax department issuing notices doesn’t mean the law was broken. TRS leaders collected contributions, and everything was done transparently. Based on Revanth’s petition, Delhi high court issued directions to Income Tax department which is following court orders. All party leaders will reply to the notices. There was no foul play.”Revanth has also alleged that collecting party funds in cash for an amount more than ?20,000 is not allowed. It has to be done through cheque. “TRS party didn’t show this collection in their returns filed with the Election Commission,” he alleged. “Ministers, MPs and MLAs and businessmen also didn’t show them in their returns. Almost all ministers went to establishments falling in the jurisdiction of their departments. For instance, the civil supplies minister went to rice mills, education minister went to colleges and health minister to hospitals,” he added.",hyderabad,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73972796,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-424390,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/i-t-lens-on-trs-brass-earnings-on-selling-ice-creams-playing-porters/articleshow/73970246.cms

HYDERABAD: Former Congress minister DK Samarasimha Reddy has urged chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao to constitute a cabinet sub-committee to study and consult all stakeholders before replacing the existing Revenue Act with a new one.

He said the previous government had convened all-party meetings in addition to consulting the stakeholders, including holding meetings with villagers, before revising the Panchayat Raj Act. “Any revision of the Revenue Act should be done with the intention of benefiting the people. The existing Revenue Act in Telangana is comprehensive and a good one,” the senior Congress leader said at a press conference on Wednesday.

At a separate press conference, TPCC election coordination committee convenor G Niranjan demanded that state election commissioner V Nagi Reddy resign from his post. “If Congress Rajya Sabha member KVP Ramachandra Rao was allowed to vote in Nereducherla municipality, how could SEC allow TRS MP K Keshava Rao to vote in Tukkuguda municipality,” he wondered.

Niranjan also demanded that KCR talk about the fate of Metro Rail in the Old City.

223,['6/02/2020'],Bombay HC seeks explanation from babu over ‘misleading’ wetlands data,"This story is from February 6, 2020

Bombay high court (File Photo)

MUMBAI: The Bombay high court said on Wednesday it was “clear that the under secretary , state environment department , filed an affidavit making an incorrect statement and misled the court as well as his advocate,” in a matter regarding identification of wetlands .

A bench of Justices S J Kathawalla and B P Colabawalla said, “We call on the under secretary of the environment department to explain why action not should be taken for making incorrect statements” which were relied on by court for action against collectors of Parbhani, Nandurbar and Nagpur “who it now appears are not at fault”.

Government pleader P P Kakde submitted three affidavits by the collectors who said there was no wetland in these districts, except for one in a forest area in Nagpur.

The “fault” or controversy was over whether there were any wetlands in three districts or none, as the district collectors mentioned. On January 29, the HC had seen the under secretary’s affidavit. That affidavit said wetland sites were “verified’’ and set out the number in a table. The HC had noted the official had said “while in previous affidavits it was mentioned that there were no wetlands in Nandurbar, Nagpur and Parbhani districts, this was based on the reports received from the respective district collectors; however, after the ‘ground truthing’ was carried out, the actual number of wetlands observed” were set out.

The court is hearing two PILs, one by NGO Vanashakti filed in 2013 for preservation and identification of wetlands. In 2013, the HC had passed orders for identification of wetlands based on 2010 rules. Last December, state lawyer G W Mattos said the rules had changed in 2017 with a new definition of wetlands. HC had then slammed the state for “dragging its feet’’ for eight years, in preparing the “brief document” to identify wetlands and frame a policy.

Gayatri Singh, counsel for Vanashakti, said in Thane the expert panel report found 114 wetlands out of 132 sites. In the brief document given in court, though, only eight were identified and alleged the wetlands were being excluded. Mattos said no experts panels were formed. He said any discrepancy can be raised before the wetlands authority’s grievance redressal committee. To this, Justice Kathawalla, in a lighter vein, said, “There is no better grievance redressal than us.”

The course is being run in the picturesque Dayara meadow by NIM

UTTARKASHI: After a gap of seven years, Uttarkashi-based Nehru Institute of Mountaineering ( NIM ) has restarted its snow skiing course at Bharnala region of Dayara meadow in Uttarkashi district.

As many as 30 adventure lovers from different parts of the country are participating in the 14-day training course, which began on January 28. Officials associated with the premier national mountaineering training institute told TOI that they are also mulling to develop Dayara meadow as a world-class snow skiing ground on the lines of Auli .

Colonel Amit Bisht , principal of NIM, said, “Besides providing training of mountaineering, sports climbing and other high-altitude adventure sports, NIM also used to organise regular snow skiing course till 2012. But, the course got discontinued in 2013, as our personnel got involved in the reconstruction work of Kedarnath valley post the flash floods disaster. Now, we have once again restarted the course from the last week of January and will organise it on a regular basis.”

“To tap into Uttarkashi’s tremendous adventure sports possibilities, we are now aiming to develop Dayara meadow as a world-class snow skiing ground on the lines of Auli in Joshimath . Besides, NIM will also use these training courses to form Uttarakhand’s state skiing team, which will compete in national and international-level events,” he added.

Meanwhile, local villagers expressed happiness over the re-launch of the snow skiing course. Pankaj Kushwal , a tour operator in Raithal village situated near Dayara meadow, said, “The course will help in developing Dayara meadow as a winter sports destination. It will also increase the rush of adventure lovers to the largely unexplored meadow and eventually boost the local economy.”

NAINITAL: A man, believed to be part of a local mining mafia syndicate, opened fire at four forest department officials who were inspecting a mining site in Ramnagar area of Nainital district on Monday. He was arrested by police late on Tuesday.

Police said that the forest team had gone to the spot late on Monday for inspection when the man, identified as Anand Manral , countered them. “The officials were inspecting the Kosi riverbed where they found the accused acting suspiciously. When they confronted him, at first he tried to fight but seeing himself getting overpowered, he opened fire at them and fled,” said Ramnagar station house officer Ravi Saini .

Saini added that the team included a forest inspector and his three associates. “Fortunately no one was injured in the firing but as the officials filed a complaint, a case was registered and we conducted raids at certain locations. We arrested the accused on Tuesday from Tehsil Gate area and presented him before the magistrate who ordered his custody,” Saini said.

This is not the first instance in which people suspected to have connections with mining mafia have threatened government officials. In 2015, a trainee IFS officer was attacked in Ramnagar when she was conducting a raid on illegal mining while in 2017, a forest beat watcher was killed when he was run over by a tractor by members of mining mafia. The incident also took place on the Kosi riverbed near Ramnagar.

Saini meanwhile said that they have started the investigation and are questioning Manral about his connections with illegal mining syndicates.

He added that the accused has been booked under sections 186 (obstructing public servant in discharge of public duties), 353 (assault or criminal force to deter public servant from his duties), 504 (intentional insult with intent to provoke breach of peace) and 506 (criminal intimidation) of Indian Penal Code.

Thanjavur: The Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) has deputed more than 70 of its employees to keep the structures, inscriptions, sculptures at the Big Temple without getting damaged, as thousands of devotees have converged during the consecration ceremony of the temple. It was a step to ensure that none of the historical structures are damaged by anyone.

The ASI took up the renovation of the Brihadeeswarar temple at a cost of Rs 50 lakh. Though it was a periodic maintenance work carried out by the ASI, it coincided with the consecration of Big Temple.

The ASI has done chemical cleaning of sculptures, inscriptions and structures including all the gopurams and vimanam of the Big Temple.

An official from the science branch of the ASI, Purasoparaj, told TOI that chemical cleaning was done by adopting four steps such as chemical cleaning, consolidation, bio side treatment and preservation.

On the steps taken to keep the structure intact, conservation assistant of ASI S Shankar said that they have entrusted the responsibility with 70 people, including 15 regular ASI staff. “Our people are taking utmost care by resisting devotees if they knowingly or unknowingly do any harm to the structure, sculpture and inscriptions,” he added.

Garbage gathered on the temple premises would be cleaned during night hours. Mass cleaning would be done along with municipal corporation workers, Shankar added.

AURANGABAD: A 40-year-old man has been arrested by Sillod police for forcefully entering the house of a woman and setting her on fire by pouring kerosene following an argument in Andhari village on Sunday night.

Hearing the woman’s cries for help, her daughter and son-in-law — who live nearby — rushed to her rescue and took her to Aurangabad ’s Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH), where she is battling for life with over 70% burns, said police on Wednesday.

The suspect, identified as Santosh Mohite (40), was arrested and produced before a local court that remanded him in six-day police custody. Mokshada Patil, superintendent of police (Aurangabad rural), on Wednesday said police have gathered all the evidence and the seized material has been sent for chemical analysis (CA).

“Our Inquiry is complete and we are waiting for the CA report. Charge-sheet in this case will be filed within 15 to 20 days,” she said.

“One of the victim’s relatives said that the man was known to the victim and both were comfortable with each other. It is a serious crime and we have left no stone unturned to make a tight case against the culprit,” Patil added.

Meanwhile, police sources said that Mohite operates a bar in the village. “The complainant has stated that she was alone in the house when the suspect knocked at the door. As soon as she opened the door, the suspect entered the house. The woman objected to it and said visiting her at odd hours would bring her disrepute.”

The source added, “The suspect took offence to the victim’s statement and started assaulting her. He then threw kerosene at her and threw a match stick. The woman’s saree caught fire following which she started crying for help. Her daughter and son-in-law rushed to help and doused the flames before taking her to the hospital.”

234,['6/02/2020'],Grand consecration at Big Temple after 23 years,"This story is from February 6, 2020

Thanjavur: Thousands on Wednesday witnessed the grand consecration at the Brihadeeswarar Temple (Big Temple) in Thanjavur, conducted after a gap of 23 years. As per court order, the ceremony was performed in both Tamil and Sanskrit.

A group of Odhuvars recited Thirgnanasambandhar’s Thirumurai before pouring holy water on the ‘Kalasam’ erected atop the Vimanam (temple tower) of the Big Temple at 9.21 am on Wednesday after vedic hymns were recited in Sanskrit by priests.

The events began on January 27. Poorvanga puja and eight Kala Yaga pujas were held on February 1, and the event concluded with the final phase of eight Kala puja on Wednesday early morning. Later, holy water brought from Ýaga Salai was taken to the temple tower in a procession.

P Maniarasan, coordinator of the Big Temple Rights Retrieval Committee who had initially demanded that the ritual be conducted in Tamil, said, ""Our efforts to bring Tamil in the forefront during the consecration have succeeded. Not only the Big Temple but all the temples, whether owned by the Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments (HR&CE) or private parties, Tamil should be the main language during rituals. We want to conduct ‘kumbabishekam’ (consecration) in all the temples in Tamil.""

Meanwhile, several departments of the state government along with the HR&CE made elaborate arrangements for devotees to have a hassle-free darshan.

District collector M Govinda Rao participated in the event. Hundreds of police personnel have been deployed at the temple. Inspector general of police (central zone) A Amalraj supervised the security arrangements.

THANJAVUR: For 93-year-old M Natarajan, visiting temples carrying his handheld fan (Saamaram) made of peacock feather during consecrations is a usual practice. He would participate in the temple procession waving the fan. During the consecration of the Big Temple, he told TOI that he has been doing this for the past 53 years as a ‘Kaingaryam’ (service).

THANJAVUR: More than 50 Odhuvars from across the state recite Thevaram, Thirumurai at Yagasalai puja during the consecration. They expressed happiness and wished this be followed at all the temples. Devotees and general public were excited to hear the hymn and puja in Tamil during the consecration of Big Temple in Thanjavur .

Following various petitions filed before the Madurai bench of the Madras high court, the HR&CE authorities were ordered to hold various rituals and pujas in accordance with the agama principles and Tamil should also be given due importance by chanting Thirumurai in the language.

As per the directives, more than 50 Odhuvars were engaged in Thirumurai recitation during the consecration ceremony. Senior Odhuvars from across the state including Muthukumaran from Madurai, Kumaraswaminathan from Karur , Swaminathan from Tiruthani, Shanmugasundaram from Palani , Sivakumar from Mayiladuthurai recited Thirumurai from Yaga Salai puja till the beginning of the consecration ceremony.

During the eight Kala puja at the Yaga Salai, two senior Odhuvars presented Thirumurai songs. They also recited Akhanda Parayanam. Another group of Odhuvars presented Panniru Thirumurai Mutrothal at the Yaga Salai. On the day of consecration, the Odhuvars presented Akhanda Parayanam altogether in front of the shrine.

S Mangai, 65, from Kumbakonam who participated in the event was excited after hearing mantras being recited in Tamil during the ceremony. “I have never heard Tamil in temples during consecration. This is the first time that I heard Tamil. I am so happy. We need not neglect any other language. But if Tamil is going to play a major role, everybody can understand it well,” she said.

R Vijayan, 22, an employee of a theatre in Thanjavur, said he had heard Tamil hymns recited by Odhuvars at the temple. But, it was the first time he had the opportunity to hear Tamil during the ceremony.

Meanwhile, few devotees opined that as per the agama principles hymns should only be recited in Sanskrit. “Since it is the practice for years, we should not change it all of a sudden,” K Manoharan of Karur said.

239,['6/02/2020'],Collector who conducted first consecration seeks more funds for Big Temple,"This story is from February 6, 2020

THANJAVUR: Besides stressing on various issues to the government with regard to Big Temple, people should ask for more funds to develop the Unesco heritage site in a better way, said T Gangappa, the collector of the erstwhile integrated district of Thanjavur , who conducted the first consecration of Big Temple after Independence.

As per Hindu custom, consecration of a temple should be performed once in 12 years. Sources from the HR&CE department said that the Big Temple had consecrations in 1010, 1729, 1843, 1980 and 1997.

Of the few consecrations, the one held in 1980 was the first consecration performed after the Independence, Gangappa said. He was the district collector of the integrated districts of Thanjavur, Nagapattinam and Tiruvarur between June 1979 and April 1980.

In March 1980, he conducted mahamaham in Kumbakonam followed by the consecration of Big Temple in April, he said. “Unlike now, crowd management was not that difficult then. Devotees were self-disciplined. During both events, not even a single incident of a pickpocket was reported. Now the situation has entirely changed. Despite scores of challenges, district collector Govinda Rao has done a good job,” he said.

He also participated in the consecration held in 1997 as a devotee, where more than 40 devotees died in a fire accident, he said.

“There may be several issues with regard to conducting consecration. But as a Tamil, we the people of Tamil Nadu should focus our target for the development of Big Temple. It lacks several facilities as a Unesco heritage monument. We should try to get more fund from the government and should take the fame of the historic temple to the nook and corners of the world,” he added.

BHOPAL: The Kamal Nath-led cabinet in Madhya Pradesh passed a resolution against Citizenship Amendment Act on Wednesday morning, becoming the sixth state and fourth Congress-ruled government to do so. The resolution will now be forwarded to the Narendra Modi-led Union government, said law minister P C Sharma.

“The Madhya Pradesh government, in order to ensure equality to all sections of people before law, as intended and provided in the Indian Constitution, urges the government of India to repeal Citizenship (Amendment) Act 2019,” says the resolution.

Punjab, Bengal, Kerala , Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh have passed similar resolutions. “The MP government also urges the Government of India not to seek new information for updation of National Population Register (NPR) 2020 from people so that apprehensions in the minds of citizens is dispelled and only after this NPR updation work is undertaken,” it adds.

Secularism is a fundamental percept of the Constitution, and it cannot be changed, the resolution says. “Preamble of the Constitution clearly mentions that India is a secular nation. Besides, Article 14 of the Constitution guarantees equality to all sections of people without discrimination. This (CAA) will threaten the very secular fabric and spirit of tolerance in the country,” it says, arguing that CAA 2019 is discrimi natory as it grants citizenship on grounds of religion.

“It is not in keeping with the secular character of Indian Constitution. After the Constitution came into effect, it is for the first time that a law has been enacted that discriminates among people on the grounds of religion. This will jeopardize the secular character of the nation and its belief in communal harmony,” the resolution warned. The Kamal Nath government wonders why CAA was enacted at all.

246,['6/02/2020'],"Goa: urvey skips state of economy, data riddled with inaccuracies","This story is from February 6, 2020

Goa chief minister Pramod Sawant

PANAJI: On the eve of the state budget , the economic survey for 2019-20 tabled by the government on Wednesday is strangely silent on how Goa’s economy performed in the current financial year.

The survey itself is full of errors and appears disconnected from ground reality with government officials blaming lack of data forcing them to calculate even the growth by taking an average projected growth rate of the past five financial years.

Chief minister Pramod Sawant , who also holds the finance portfolio, will present his maiden budget on Thursday as the state reels under mining shutdown, fewer footfalls from tourists, lower GST collections and a sluggish economy.

Government officials told TOI that Goa’s economy is expected to grow at around 6%, if one removes inflation, in 2019-20, while the nominal growth is likely to be a shade higher at 9.5%.

The state’s gross state domestic product (GSDP), according to the economic survey, grew by 17.65% at constant prices in 2018-19, the year when mining came to a standstill and private sector investments dried up.

This number is expected to come down in the coming months as data comes in, said government officials.

Real growth is calculated at constant prices as it accounts for the changes in prices of all goods and services produced in the state and provides a more accurate estimate of economic growth compared to nominal growth which is measured at current prices.

The economic survey said Goa’s economy grew at 9.82% at current prices in 2018-19 and the slowdown has been attributed to the ban on mining.

The economic survey did not give sector wise contribution to the GSDP for 2019-20. An official with the directorate of planning, statistics and evaluation said data for 2019-20 was dropped at the last minute on the instructions of the government.

Academicians from the field of economics said that nominal growth (current prices) is usually higher than real growth (constant prices), but the economic survey shows an inverse trend.

Another discrepancy seen in the report is in the public debt estimates with the economic survey pegging the state’s debt at Rs 15,008.66 crore, while documents released in the ongoing state legislative assembly session peg the total debt at Rs 20,411.61 crore.

The survey report also said that tax revenue for 2019-20 shows a 10.1% increase as compared to the previous financial year of which the state’s own tax revenue shows a growth rate of 9.1% and share in central taxes at 12%.

The survey projects that non-tax collections for 2019-20 will stand at Rs 3,100 crore.

247,['6/02/2020'],Notice issued to 14 power plants a month after deadline expires,"This story is from February 6, 2020

Representative image

NAGPUR: Fourteen coal-based power plants in the country are set to face severe action for defying the deadline set for installing environment protection measures. In show cause notices sent on January 31 – a day before the Union budget – the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) sought an explanation from the plants why they should not be closed down and environmental compensation be imposed.

Significantly, the board sent the letters exactly a month after the second deadline (December 31, 2019) expired for emission reduction that was submitted in the Supreme Court. Continuous attempts by TOI throughout January asking what action was being planned did not elicit information from the body.

On January 19, TOI had reported that the operation of plants post the deadline was in violation of the Centre’s promises made in the apex court.

Among the designated plants – which totally produce around 16.41GW of power – 5 are in Haryana, 3 in Punjab, 2 each in Uttar Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh and Telangana, and 1 in Tamil Nadu.

While announcing the Union budget on February 1, finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman stated that old plants not meeting emissions norms will be closed. Show casue notices issued the next day have granted power plants a time period of 15 days to submit their responses.

Speaking to TOI, CPCB’s member secretary Prashant Gargava said that the board will be reviewing individual progress made by all the plants. “While we have issued similar show cause notices to all units which failed to comply with our directions, different actions will be taken as the plants are at different stages of installing pollution control equipment. Some have initiated the bidding process, some are expected to comply with the emissions in a month or two,” he said.

According to the notices, different plants have failed in complying with emission targets of different pollutants including sulphur dioxide, particulate matter and oxide of nitrogen. All the 14 plants have failed to retrofit flu-gas desulphurization (FGD), a technology to control SO2 emissions.

Welcoming the step taken by CPCB, environment experts stated that strict action should be taken to set a strong precedent for other power plants. “Units which are yet to make significant progress should be shut down and penalized heavily. To ensure that the other plants having 2020 and later deadlines do not meet the same fate, CPCB should set interim targets and milestones,” said Sunil Dahiya, analyst at the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air (CREA).

In a notification issued by the Union environment ministry in December 2015, all coal-fired power plants were first directed to install pollution-control technologies by December 2017. The plants failed to do so.

The deadline was then extended to December 2019 after the ministry of power and central electricity authority (CEA) submitted a new phasing plan in the Supreme Court in 2018.

The ministry submission came during a hearing related to extension of deadline for implementing emission standards as part of the MC Mehta case.

AURANGABAD: As many as 500 women from rural and urban areas of Latur planted 5,000 saplings of 70 different species under the plantation drive on Tuesday.

Women, including school teacher and college professors, took part in the drive organised under the aegis of the Mission Green Earth, the Art of Living (AOL) and International Association for Human Values at Nagzari village and Manjara River Rejuvenation Project.

Mahadeo Gomare, state project director of the Art of Living, said that “As the world reels under devastating effects of climate change, with Australian bushfires claiming billions of animal lives and the Amazon losing critical biodiversity, people are looking at solutions to combat and reverse these effects.’’

One powerful way in this fight against climate change is by planting more saplings to increase the green cover, and support agroforestry that has far reaching environmental and economic benefits for everyone, and particularly for farmers, he said.

“Rural women are the key to supply food, water, nutrition and everything necessary to sustain their village. Their role within the community is indispensable. They are the most affected by the reduction in rainfall, depleting soil nutrients and low-quality food. With this programme, we want to bring women belonging to different walks of life together to plant trees and be an agent of change for securing food, nutrition and water for the community, “ said Gomare.

Gomare said that due to the changing climate patterns, the cultivation of plants in Marathwada and Vidarbha is the only option to maintain economic stability in the region. Tree plantation helps farmers earn extra income. Farmers will be able to thrive and can gain economic stability. Plantation helps to increase the rainfall, maintain it consistently and increase the water turnover in the soil.

He also said an International Women’s Conference will be organised between February 14 and 16 in Bangalore, where 500 women leaders from across the globe will take the Mission Green Earth forward by pledging to plant 10 million saplings in the next two years.

249,['6/02/2020'],"12 city traffic cops booked for graft in 5 years, state tells HC","This story is from February 6, 2020

Mumbai: A dozen city traffic constables were booked under Prevention of Corruption Act in the last five years, the state government told Bombay high court and listed steps taken to ensure smooth traffic. An affidavit was filed in 2018 in a PIL filed in 2017, alleging rampant corruption in traffic police department, which was disposed of on Monday as the department had shown compliance to earlier orders.

With the matter not reaching final hearing for two years due to lack of time, public prosecutor Deepak Thakare pointed to affidavits of 2018 before a bench of Justices Ranjit More and S P Tavade. In the last order in February 2018, a bench of Justices S C Dharmadhikari and Bharati Dangre had expressed “hope and trust’’ that the joint commissioner of police (traffic), who had filed an affidavit, and deputy police commissioner (traffic), would spread public awareness on where to complain about “traffic police seeking bribe from drivers of two and four wheelers or heavy vehicles’’.

“It is unfortunate that our time is wasted in reminding officials… that this court expects them to work sincerely and diligently,’’ the bench had said in its 2018 order. “We are not saying that… traffic congestion can be eliminated suddenly given the number of vehicles and increasing population, but such incidents can always be minimized,’’ said the HC, telling police to take a leaf from densely populated cities abroad.

“If sincere efforts are undertaken, and on par with thickly populated cities in India and abroad, such issues can be tackled. We hope and trust that beyond these affidavits, the data will be placed before us and concrete action is taken,” it said.

The HC had in 2018 said people could complain about traffic police talking over the phone instead of assisting motorists and also about those not towing away vehicles parked illegally.

The PIL, filed by policeman, Sunil Toke, said his lawyers, Pradeep Havnur and Datta Mane, sought to raise a larger concern against corruption by traffic police. The traffic police said that in compliance with the 2018 directions, they had issued more than 3.75 lakh in six months for illegal parking and towed away almost 1.5 lakh vehicles. They also recruited over 1,100 traffic wardens and received 165 email complaints, of which 52 pertained to bribes being sought. Fifteen turned out to be baseless, but in 25 cases, allegations were prima facie true; four police personnel were suspended, eight issued show-cause notices, and 13 transferred to non-executive posts.

Police said they had 213 handheld breathalysers since 2017.

Noting lack of parking space around schools, police requested some schools to ensure buses are made compulsory, with Cathedral school having agreed to participate in a pilot project.

AURANGABAD: Marathwada , a region having the lowest forest cover in Maharashtra, has witnessed as many as 696 forest fire incidents in the past four years. These calamities have destroyed 2,598 hectare forest cover in the region, further reducing the forest cover.

Coinciding with the ongoing forest fire prevention week being observed in Maharashtra by the state forest department, authorities have brought to public notice that those who are responsible for causing such disaster can be subjected to imprisonment of upto two years, besides getting slapped with a fine of Rs 5,000.

Chief conservator of forests (territorial), Aurangabad , P K Mahajan on Wednesday said that locals dwelling around forest areas as well as tourists visiting the forests must ensure that no man-made activity on their part triggers forest fire.

“Stringent laws are in place to deal with the incidents of forest fire arising due to man-made causes and persons involved it. Forest fire destructs local biodiversity and such harm can by irreversible. It is collective responsibility of people to ensure that such untoward incidents do not occur,” he said.

Aurangabad forest circle, which consists of three territorial divisions and three independent sub divisions, has total forest cover of 2882.78 sq km. The area deals with all reserved, protected and unclassified forests, among other areas, except the areas included in Gautala Autramghat Wildlife Sanctuary, Jaikwadi Bird Sanctuary, Painganga Sanctuary, Naigaon Peacock Sanctuary and Yedshi Ramling Ghat Sanctuary.

According to official data, forest fires in Marathwada have increased since 2017 with a slight dip in the figures last year.

Forest department authorities said that “unknown persons” are responsible for around 99% fire incidents by and large. “It is difficult to trace people who are responsible for triggering forest fires as it is an open territory. Proper awareness about the ill-effects of such fires on local biodiversity and humans as a whole can contain the incidents of forest fires,” authorities said.

Wildlife expert Hemant Chhajed said the that the forest department must adopt zero-tolerance policy while dealing with the incidents of forest fires.

“Besides enabling provisions of the Indian Forest Act, 1927, the government agencies are empowered with Wildlife Protection Act, 1972, Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, 1967, The Prevention of Damage to Public Property Act, 1984 and Biological Diversity Act, 2002 to deal with the culprits associated with forest fires. These legal tools must be used to take the investigation in the incidents of forest fires to the logical end and punish the guilty,” he said.

Citing an affidavit submitted by the Centre in the Supreme Court in one of the environmental cases, Chhajed said that a forest land of around one hectare is worth around Rs 1.62 crore. “The damage caused by forest fires in Marathwada in the last four years runs into crores of rupees, besides inflicting harm upon the wildlife and biodiversity,” he said.

Experts have also stressed on the need for focussing on preventive measures such as taking ‘fire line’ in the protected and reserved forest areas, ensuring sufficient availability of the fire-fighting equipment and proper training to forest department staffers to reduce the number of forest fires.

PANAJI: Vehicle density in Goa stands at one vehicle per person. The economic survey 2019-20 states that 14.5 lakh vehicles have been registered in the state as on December 31, 2019, even as provisional figures of the Census 2011 places Goa’s population at just about 14.5 lakh.

On an average, 80,500 vehicles are registered in the state every year, according to the latest economic survey of the state. The number of vehicles registered during the financial year 2019-20, up to December 31, 2019, is 46,352.

Figures for the distribution of vehicles in the financial year 2018-19 indicate an increase in registration of transport vehicles.

With taxi registrations going up drastically, and goods vehicles and hire motorcycles rising slightly, it could be a likely contributing factor for increased vehicle population in the state.

Compared to 1,269 taxi registrations in the financial year 2016-17, there were 116 more registrations in 2017-18 with a total of 1,385 taxis registered. This further increased to 3,024 taxi registrations in 2018-19.

Figures indicate an overall drop in non-transport vehicles with only 75,085 registrations in 2018-19 as opposed to 86,119 in 2017-18.

Even two-wheelers, the most preferred mode of transport in the state, saw a fall with motorcycle and scooter registrations reducing by nearly 9,500. A total of 50,209 were registered in 2018-19 as opposed to 59,734 in 2017-18 and 56,926 in 2016-17.

Motorcycles for hire on the other hand escalated to 1,986 registrations in 2018-19 as opposed to 1,566 the previous year. These fall under the transport vehicles category. A total of 7,282 vehicles sum up transport vehicles, like motorcycles for hire, goods vehicles, taxis, buses and mini buses (including those of the Kadamba Transport Corporation), and auto-rickshaws.

The purchase of private cars and jeeps have shown a slight drop compared to the last financial year with 17,414 registered in 2018-19 compared to 20,990 in 2017-18 and 18,267 in the financial year prior to that.

Illustration used for representational purpose.

MARGAO: Despite the state government’s “efforts” to promote agriculture in the state, the growth rate of Gross Value Added (GVA) for the sector is on a steep decline.

This was evident from a written reply tabled in the House by agriculture minister Chandrakant Kavalekar , to a question posed by Margao MLA Digambar Kamat pertaining to the rate of growth of agriculture.

While in 2017-18, GVA figures stood at Rs 2,09,344 lakh, posting a growth rate of 12.93%, 2011-12 being the base year, the figures slumped to Rs 1,88,958 lakh in 2018-19, reflecting negative growth at a rate of 9.74%.

A separate written reply tabled by Kavalekar in the House to a question raised by St Andre MLA Francisco Silveira also points to the decreasing area of land under paddy cultivation, and falling rice production in the state.

In 2018-19, the estimated total area of land under paddy cultivation was approximately 27,219 ha during the kharif season, while it was 11,301 ha for the rabi crop. In 2019-20, however, the area under paddy cultivation decreased to 24,411 ha. As the rabi season is currently under way, the figures for this crop weren’t made available.

Meanwhile, another written reply tabled in the House by Kavalekar stated that the agriculture department disbursed Rs 90 lakh to farmers whose fields were damaged owing to inundation during the 2019 monsoon from its own budgetary allocation. The farmers were also compensated through chief minister’s relief fund, it was informed.

Kavalekar further said in his written reply that minor maintenance works of bunds and sluice gates were tendered and “accordingly, the minor breaches have been plugged on an emergency basis to avoid further damages”. The reply also stated that minor maintenance works of the bunds and the sluice gates due to damages caused by heavy rains were carried out by the respective tenants’ associations under the 50% subsidy scheme as per the direction of the concerned mamlatdars and as per the provisions of the Goa, Daman and Diu Tenancy Act, 1964.

The agriculture department has also prepared detailed estimates for strengthening of bunds after the damages which have been submitted to Water Resources Department (WRD) for accord of technical sanction. “Presently, the estimates are being scrutinized by WRD and after accord of technical sanction, the works will be tendered, after obtaining administrative approval,” Kavalekar said in his written reply.

Illustration used for representational purpose.

PORVORIM: Goa has been declared open defecation-free ( ODF ) but that does not mean all houses in panchayat areas have toilets, panchayat minister Mauvin Godinho said in the House on Wednesday.

Chief minister Pramod Sawant , too, admitted that people who had applied for bio-toilets were yet to receive them and assured that the government would supply toilets to all applicants by May.

When opposition leader Digambar Kamat asked the state government if there were any cases of open defecation despite the state being declared 100% ODF, Godinho, in a written reply, only accepted that the state had been declared ODF.

“Since the date of declaration of Goa as ODF, no work orders for construction of toilets have been issued by the Goa Waste Management Corporation , which is the executing agency,” Godinho said.

When asked if all houses in panchayat areas have toilets, Godinho replied in the negative, but did not elaborate any further. The department also chose not to provide panchayat-wise details of homes with open toilets and those that lack toilets.

In a separate reply to a question tabled by Congress Ponda MLA Ravi Naik, chief minister Sawant said contractors had already been appointed to construct bio-toilets and that the same contractors would ensure the toilets were maintained for the next three years. Naik had stated that people from the Curti-Khandepar village panchayat had made payment but had failed to receive their bio-toilets.

“The state has been declared ODF, but we are aware that there are individuals who are yet to get toilets. We will try to finish all work by May and provide toilets to them before this monsoon,” Sawant told the House.

He further said that the state had received a total of 18,518 applications for installation of bio-toilets.

“Four contractors are on board and will take care of the construction of toilets in all 12 talukas. Work on 472 bio-toilets is in progress,” Sawant said.

Elaborating on the cost, he said a toilet for individuals from the general category, including other backward classes (OBC), was Rs 2,500 while those from the scheduled castes (SC) and scheduled tribes (ST) categories will have to pay Rs 1,000. Each toilet costs Rs 58,184, he said.

MARGAO: Opposition MLAs on Wednesday jointly submitted a memorandum to the chairman of the Joint Electricity Regulatory Commission (JERC), Panaji , demanding that the petition by the state electricity department proposing a “change in billing approach” be rejected.

The memorandum states that the public notice inviting response published in local dailies was “misleading as it shows that the existing tariff for low tension domestic consumers for 2019-20 and the proposed tariff for 2020-21 as the same”.

“Though the fine print proposes a change in the billing approach for 2020-21 and in another paragraph explains the proposed non-telescopic billing approach, it is highly likely that the public will be misled and will not consider approaching the JERC as the perception would be that the tariffs have not changed,” the memorandum reads.

Stating that the public notice also points to the revenue gap of Rs 296.8 crore that is sought to be met through budgetary support by the state government, the opposition MLAs have demanded that, “the power department should provide evidence that it has taken all necessary and possible steps to plug transmission and distribution losses, loss of revenue due to theft of energy and non-billing and non-recovery of arrears from consumers”.

Power minister Nilesh Cabral described the MLAs’ representation as drama and said the power tariff is not hiked.

Former chief minister of Goa Churchill Alemao

PANAJI: While the House went back and forth on what measures could be taken to ensure the safety of tigers in the state, former chief minister Churchill Alemao raised the need to safeguard the lives of humans as well. Alemao asked when humans are “punished” for “eating cow meat” can a tiger be spared for the same offence?

In true Alemao fashion, he raised the need for the government to be more humane in its approach. “Can a tiger eat a cow and there be no punishment for him?” he said on Wednesday.

While the statement drew scoffs from members of the House, Alemao made a case for protection of all— cow, man and tiger. The lone NCP MLA said, “This a serious matter, don’t laugh at me.”

Last month, four tigers—three cubs and a tigress— were killed in the state. He said that as per the forest act, tiger tops the list, while for humans the cow is more important. Alemao said poor villagers who lost their cows to tiger attacks, also lost their source of livelihood. “If a poor man loses his cow, his source of livelihood is destroyed. What if he has done something to the tiger, will he (man) be punished? Isn’t there any value for human life?” he said.

The former minister pointed out that even stray animals are tended to and cared for. “Former Union minister Maneka Gandhi wanted to do something for stray dogs. I see people sleeping on road and there is no one to look after them,” he said, urging the government to look at issues on “humanitarian grounds”.

The government must take steps to ensure that such incidents do not happen while also protecting villagers staying close to wildlife sanctuary, he said.

Five suspects arrested in connection with the poisoning of the tigers have been released on bail. The Goa government has faced flak for its lapse in protecting wildlife.

Chief minister Pramod Sawant told the House that an investigation is under way and that they are awaiting the reports of the viscera samples sent to four different laboratories in the country.

Earlier, former deputy chief minister Vijai Sardesai demanded a CBI probe into the incident.

DDA has also approved the change for six other plots spread over 86 acres in the Lutyens’ Bungalow Zone

NEW DELHI: The Delhi Development Authority ( DDA ), which has received more than 400 objections to the proposed change of land use of different plots in central Delhi for the proposed Central Vista redevelopment project , is going to hold a public hearing on Thursday and Friday before finalising the move.

In December, the authority changed the land use of different plots, including that of a 15-acre plot on Dalhousie Road near South Block, from recreational to residential. This is the location where a new Prime Minister’s residence has been proposed. DDA has also approved the change for six other plots spread over 86 acres in the Lutyens’ Bungalow Zone.

The approvals include the change of land use from public and semi-public to government offices for plots where Vigyan Bhavan, National Archives and Raksha Bhavan are located. The land use for a 9.5-acre plot has been changed from recreational to Parliament House.

The changes were put in the public domain for 30 days and a board of inquiry will now take up the suggestions and objections, following which the Union housing and urban affairs ministry will come up with the final notifications. DDA has received various objections, ranging from questioning the need for the project to its impact on environment and traffic. A DDA official, however, said most of the submissions were repetitve and overlapping.

Villupuram: Srivella Prasad , secretary of All India Congress Committee, in a veiled barb hit out at actor Rajinikanth for spreading misinformation about Dravidian leader Periyar and for backing the BJP on CAA , NPR and NRC on Wednesday. He attended a Congress Villupuram central district general body meeting at a guest house here.

“One cinema actor who wants to transform himself as a politician and is trying to taint the history of Tamil Nadu and great Dravidian leaders like Periyar who stood for secularism. It is apparent that the actor follows the ideology of BJP by supporting CAA, NRC and NPR in a recent media interview,” Prasad said.

Strongly criticising the AIADMK government for backing the BJP in the Centre whose main agenda is to “destroy democracy and constitution of the country with its anti-people policies, including CAA”, he said that it should give a clear explanation for backing the BJP.

“It is a general perception that only the ruling party will get a majority in the local body elections, but DMK and Congress coalition broke it in the recent local body elections in Tamil Nadu. Today’s meeting seeks to come up with a strategy to prove the majority of DMK and Congress alliance in the pending local body elections,” he said.

Prasad said secularism and democracy is under threat for the past six years under the BJP regime and that the rate of unemployment is very high in the country. The recent budget failed to offer a solution to socio-economic issues, he said.

The BJP government is least bothered about the development of the country and its main agenda is to transform India into a ‘Hindu Rashtra’ advocating the ideologies of Savarkar, a Hindu nationalist who formulated the Hindutva philosophy, added Prasad.

AHMEDABAD: The Union Budget for 2020-21 has sanctioned gauge conversion of 71km of track between Talala and Visavadar, at a cost of Rs 460 crore. The track cuts through the heart of the Gir Sanctuary . Wildlife experts believe this conversion will prove harmful to lions.The railway ministry also approved the gauge conversion for 70km of track connecting Talala and Delwada, passing through Jamwala.Railway officials said that in 2018, the Union government decided to exempt a few metre-gauge lines from conversion to broad gauge due to their tourism and heritage appeal. These routes included the metre-gauge train between Veraval and Amreli, which passes through Gir sanctuary.The Talala to Visavadar stretch was soon to be declared a heritage line. The proposal to preserve it as a heritage route meant that the line passing through the sanctuary was never be converted to broad gauge.A senior railway officer said the heritage route project was shelved as local politicians wanted the track to be converted to broad gauge. Politicians claimed that the train’s speed limit could be limited 20km per hour despite conversion into broad gauge.Wildlife experts say the conversion could prove dangerous for lions, as a broad-gauge train will move at a minimum speed of 50km while a metre-gauge train will have a minimum speed of 30km per hour.Lion experts said that when the Kodinar track was converted to broad gauge, several lions were killed on the track by speeding goods trains.The officer said the metre-gauge train connecting Veraval and Amreli makes four trips a day, two up and two down trips. The train travels 18km inside the sanctuary, entering it at Sasan and leaving its limits near Kansiya Nes.In the sanctuary, the train reduces its speed to less than 20km per hour. Fortunately, there has been no lion death on these tracks so far, the officer said.",ahmedabad,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73977345,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-320461,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/gauge-conversion-spurs-worries-about-lion-safety/articleshow/73970415.cms

Pramod Sawant

PANAJI: The state is still uncertain whether the Sanjivani Co-operative Sugar Factory, if repaired, will generate profits or not. Presently though, the government bears an annual loss of Rs 25 crore, including expenditure on subsidies, chief minister Pramod Sawant told the state assembly on Wednesday.

“Of 25,000 tonne, most of the sugarcane from the farmers has already been accepted by the factory. Only Rs 4,000-5,000 tonne remains. We are releasing payment to the factory after which that produce, too, will be accepted. The main concern of the farmers was if they should cultivate sugarcane (in the following season) or not. We have told them to go ahead and cultivate for now. We have not taken any decision on Sanjivani as of now,” Sawant said.

While Sanguem MLA Prasad Gaonkar said the government should think in the interest of the farmers more seriously, Sawant said, “One also needs to see that for many years now, they are showing three trucks for one truck (of cane). There are some. We have to see that too.”

Curtorim MLA Aleixo Reginaldo Lourenco said the chief minister should look at taking action against such fudging of records.

New Delhi: Outgoing Badarpur MLA Narayan Dutt Sharma , contesting this assembly election on a BSP ticket , was allegedly attacked by armed goons early on Thursday when he was returning from campaigning in his constituency. His car was also damaged.

Dutt, who won the Badarpur assembly seat in 2015 on an Aam Aadmi Party ticket, claimed that after wrapping up his campaign, he had just reached the lane near his house when a group of four-five men forced his driver to stop the Scorpio and smashed its windscreen with sticks. When Dutt and his aide tried to stop the attackers, they allegedly attacked the MLA too. A case of assault and criminal conspiracy has been registered at the Badarpur police station on the basis of Dutt’s complaint.

Dutt told the cops that around 1am, he was returning with his driver and one of his aides when the attackers drove past his car and blocked his way with their vehicle. They came out of the car with sticks and baseball bats and started hitting the windscreen. One of them also damaged the windowpane on his side, injuring him on the face and the head, the candidate claimed. His driver and aide were also injured. The attackers ran back to their car after vandalising the Scorpio and fled, Dutt told police.

“As none of them had covered their face, I can recognise them if I see them again. They seemed to have planned to kill me but couldn’t succeed as none of us got out of the car,” said Dutt, who was hospitalised for a few hours after the incident. The MLA shifted to the Bahujan Samaj Party after having been denied a ticket this time.

DCP (Southeast) R P Meena said police had found some clues and were questioning a few people to identify the accused.

The aide who was travelling with the candidate claimed that the attack might be linked to a monetary scam that Dutt had exposed. “We have requested police to check this angle,” he said.

Arvind Kejriwal welcomed PM's announcement of a Ram Temple Trust, saying there was no bad timing for good work

NEW DELHI: Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Wednesday invited Union home minister Amit Shah for an open debate after BJP ignored a “1pm deadline” set by him to reveal its chief ministerial candidate for the Delhi elections. “Amit Shah ji should come and debate with us at a place and time of his choosing. I will debate with him on every issue he wants to talk about,” Kejriwal said.

He said the people of Delhi had a lot of questions on their minds. “Let us have an open and honest debate. Debate is good for democracy. There will be one anchor from our side and another from yours,” Kejriwal proposed.

He said BJP should at least declare the likely candidates for the chief minister’s post. “If you can’t tell who your chief minister face is, at least announce your likely candidates. Whether it’s Vijay Goel, Manoj Tiwari, Hardeep Singh Puri, Harsh Vardhan ji, or Smriti Irani... people should know before they cast their vote,” Kejriwal said.

The AAP national convener also wondered why BJP did not clear the roads near Shaheen Bagh , where a public protest against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act was on for nearly two months, and said the party was doing “dirty politics” over the issue to grab power in the capital. “The entire country is watching that for the sole aim of winning the elections, you have inconvenienced the people living there,” he said.

Responding to media queries on the alleged links of Shaheen Bagh attacker Kapil Baisla’s with Aam Aadmi Party, the CM said: “If the attacker is found to have links with AAP, he should be punished with 20 years of imprisonment and not 10. Don’t play dirty politics over national security. People understand your intentions.”

On the Prime Minister’s announcement of a Ram Temple Trust just ahead of polls in Delhi, Kejriwal said: “I welcome this development and congratulate the people of India. There is no bad timing for good work and I don’t object to its timing. Make more good announcements.”

Talking about BJP’s election campaign, the CM said that India could never develop by playing Hindu-Muslim politics. “We want to make a 21st-century India. Our country has all the resources, but our system and politics are wrong. Education and infrastructure (development) is the only way forward. India can never develop by doing Hindu (politics).”

In a dig at Uttar Pradesh CM Yogi Adityanath who had claimed that Kejriwal was now reciting Hanuman Chalisa as he feared losing the elections, the CM said: “BJP should also chant Hanuman Chalisa... if they do it regularly, they will get peace of mind...”

He slammed Shah for seeking votes in Delhi by claiming that Bharatiya Janata Party had abrogated Article 370 in Jammu and Kashmir and paved the way for the construction of Ram Temple in Ayodhya . “They have already received votes for these issues in the general election. What did they do for Delhi in the last five years? Why should people vote for them in Delhi?” he asked.

He also questioned BJP’s performance in the corporations in last the 15 years. “Why are they against the free services being provided to the people of Delhi and why do they want to end them?” he asked.

The chief minister said BJP called him a terrorist, but didn’t give any proof. “How is this son of Delhi a terrorist? Prakash Javadekar says he has proof... bring it out in public domain,” he retorted.

PUNE: The students of Zilla Parishad schools in the district attempting the practice paper for the middle (Standard V) and high school (Standard VIII) scholarship exams received the question paper as well as its answer key on January 31.

As per practice, the ZP conducts mock tests for students before the examination. It is conducted in schools taluka-wise. On January 31, the exams were conducted in the Mulshi and Maval talukas when the incident occurred.

One of the teachers realized the mistake and notified the Zilla Parishad (ZP) education office, following which the exam was stopped.

The Shiv Sena leader at Pune ZP Devidas Darekar raised the issue with the ZP CEO Ayush Prasad. He said, “The question papers distributed to the students were of 15 pages and the answer keys were printed on the 16th page. The format was such that if the answer to a question was the “a” option, then the answer keys had the correct answers printed on the page for all the 75 questions in the papers. The CEO has promised to take action.”

Prasad said the question paper and answer key are sent to all panchayat samitis by email. “They take printouts and distribute them among the students. The printouts of the answer keys were also distributed by mistake. We have conducted an inquiry into the matter and have also sent memos to the exam supervisors as they should have realized the error. These exams are conducted on a weekly-basis so we will re-conduct another mock test this week.”

The scholarship examination, conducted by the Maharashtra State Council of Examination, will be held on February 16.

NEW DELHI: A Delhi court on Wednesday sought an action taken report ( ATR ) from Delhi Police based on a complaint filed against BJP functionaries , Anurag Thakur and Parvesh Verma , for making inflammatory speeches recently. CPM functionaries Brinda Karat and K M Tewari had approached the court, seeking an FIR against the two BJP MPs.

Additional chief metropolitan magistrate Vishal Pahuja said, “Let ATR be called from the DCP, New Delhi district/DCP concerned.”

The applicants sought a direction to the Parliament Street police station to register an FIR against the BJP functionaries for offence under sections 153A (promoting enmity between different groups on grounds of religion, race, place of birth, residence, language, etc), 153B (imputations, assertions prejudicial to national-integration), 295A (deliberate and malicious acts, intended to outrage religious feelings of any class by insulting its religion or religious beliefs), 298 (uttering, words, etc, with deliberate intent to wound the religious feelings of any person), 504 (intentional insult with intent to provoke breach of the peace), 505 (public mischief) and 506 (criminal intimidation) of the IPC.

The applicants contended that they had filed their complaint with the police commissioner’s office on January 29, 2020 against the two BJP functionaries. The complaint stated that Thakur, junior finance minister, during a rally at Rithala led a chant “desh ke gaddaron ko, goli maaro...” in reference to persons who participated in “peaceful protests against the Citizenship Amendment Act, 2019”. He had referred to the protesters as traitors, the complaint added.

West Delhi MP Verma has been accused of giving an inflammatory speech on October 27, 2019 wherein he “threatened the protesters at Shaheen Bagh”. The complaint further stated that Verma gave an interview to ANI on January 28, 2020 where he was “provocative and communal”.

The Election Commission had on January 30 barred Thakur and Verma from campaigning for 72 hours and 96 hours, respectively, over their “communal” remarks. While EC in its order said both Thakur and Verma had violated Section 123 (3A) and Section 125 of the Representation of the People Act, apart from model code of conduct, it refrained from issuing a direction to Delhi Police to file an FIR against them.

Karat accused Anurag Thakur and Parvesh Verma of seeking to incite people “as a result of which three incidents of firing took place at two different protest sites in Delhi.” She told TOI it was “absolutely shocking” that Delhi Police had failed to act in the face of “blatantly communal and divisive public statements” by a Union minister and a BJP MP.

He also said that Unesco had acknowledged Hyderabad as the “creative city of gastronomy.” “All bragging rights on best biryani in the world belong rightfully to Hyderabad Amitabh Ji (sic),” the minister tweeted. He said this in response to Niti Aayog CEO Amitabh Kant writing about his preference for a certain biryani from Kerala . KTR further said in his tweet: “Dare I say that the rest are only poor imitations. Even Unesco recognised our gourmet culture recently & conferred the title of ‘creative city of gastronomy’.”Amitabh in his tweet on Tuesday night had said: “The best biryani in world is Thalassery fish biryani from Paris restaurant. It’s made using short-grained local rice with white aikora or kingfish also known as king mackerel in Thalassery ( Kerala). It’s awesome & beats all other biryanis by miles.”Not just the Niti Aayog CEO, Twitterati was abuzz with biryani debate in the last few days with several claimants to the best biryani crown.

I tell them I’m from India, Hyderabad. Then they exclaim saying ‘Ohh Mashallah Hyderabad biryani masbuth (Hyderabad biryani is the best).

Claims came in from Bengaluru, Kanpur, Chennai, Ahmedabad, Delhi, Madurai and other places for their share of the spotlight.In fact, biryani started trending on Twitter and the thread saw numerous people giving out their views after Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath alleged, at a rally couple of days ago, that his Delhi counterpart Arvind Kejriwal was offering biryani to protesters at Shaheen Bagh.",hyderabad,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73969270,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-117490,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/who-has-the-best-biryani-niti-chief-ktr-battle-it-out/articleshow/73969271.cms

Hyderabad: Large number of vacancies in government schools has fuelled interest among several students to pursue their bachelors in education (B-Ed) instead of a professional course. This year too, authorities are expecting a rise in number of students applying for the Telangana education common entrance test (Edcet).

According to the Telangana State Public Service Commission (TSPSC) figures, there are nearly 9,000 vacant teaching positions in government schools and close to 30,000 vacancies in state-run schools. Due to a lack of teachers, as many as 4,587 government schools in the state are run by a single teacher who teaches all the subjects.

“Earlier, many people saw B-Ed as a last resort. But now, interest among students has rejuvenated due to employment opportunities that are available. This year too, we expect a rise in number of applications,” said Edcet convenor, Professor T Mrunalini. While the government has not recruited teachers for government schools in the last four years, aspirants are hopeful that TSPSC will release a recruitment notification shortly.

PUDUCHERRY: A 24-year-old antisocial element was hacked to death by the members of the rival gang on Wednesday in Puducherry. The victim was identified as Jayabal from Shanmugapuram in the town.

The murder came to light after a woman ragpicker found the body at a secluded spot near the fire station in D Nagar and alerted police. A police team, which reached the spot, recovered the body and sent it for postmortem examination.

Inquiries revealed that enmity prevailed between Jayabal and one Panneerselvam after the former attempted to murder the latter on April 6 last year. Police said Jayabal had been issuing death threats to Panneerselvam after his failed attempt to kill him.

Jayabal was consuming liquor at a vacant plot near his house on Tuesday night. Panneerselvam and his three aides decided to eliminate Jayabal and reached the spot with sharp weapons. They brutally attacked him. Jayabal, who sustained multiple injuries, died on the spot. The gang carried the body and dumped it near the fire station, where Jayabal attacked Panneerselvam last year. Police have launched efforts to nab Panneerselvam and three others, who escaped after the crime.

Mohammed Tanveer is armed with the right skills today

BENGALURU: From being a class 5 dropout who was employed in his uncle’s welding shop, Mohammed Tanveer, 28, is now a full-stack web developer earning a fat salary package, thanks to his grit and also a Bengaluru-based military-style coding institute, Masai School .

Coming from a financially disadvantaged family in Jayanagar, Tanveer took up several odd jobs before landing one at a digital marketing company where he taught himself the basics of search engine optimization (SEO).

“At 16, I was working at a fabrication workshop on a daily basis where I suffered eye injuries and physical abuse. That was when I met with a road accident, which left me bedridden for nearly three months. My sister taught me how to read and write. After a while, I signed up for a typing course which helped me land a job as a data-entry executive. I moved to other data-entry jobs and slowly worked my way up to becoming an SEO specialist. Over the next few years, I worked in digital marketing, but I always aspired to build a career as a software professional,” explained Tanveer.

At his workplace, Tanveer realised that despite substantial experience, several employees had lower designations as compared to those with degrees from top universities and less experience. He added, “I was initially apprehensive about beginning a career as a coder without an educational degree. That’s when I came across Masai School, a coding school for software engineering aspirants, and its six-month coding programme. I enrolled six months ago.”

“The programme has given me the right skills and in turn kick-started my career as a full-stack web developer,” Tanveer said.

Founder of Masai School and IIT Kanpur graduate Prateek Shukla said, “Having the right skills is key to building a job-ready workforce. With the growing technology, we need more people who are ready to adapt to changes pertaining to skillsets, which they can deploy as soon as they get into a job.”

“Companies today are realising the value of skills over degrees. This will open up more opportunities for aspirants like Tanveer. Through Masai School’s programmes, we aim to help more such individuals build their dream careers,” Shukla added.

Masai School began operations in the June 2019. It also has a branch in Patna and plans to train over 1,000 students in the next 10-12 months.

BENGALURU: Yelahanka police have arrested three people who forged domicile documents and produced certificates to show themselves as residents of Karnataka to land a job in central armed police forces (CAPFs).

Police sources said the trio — Kapil Kumar Pathak, 23, from UP; Rooparam, 21 and Balbir Singh, 22, from Rajasthan — had cleared the written exam for recruitment of jawans by Border Security Force. On Monday, they appeared for medical examination and produced domicile certificates showing that they are residents of Karnataka.

While Kapil’s documents claimed he was a resident of Saraipalya, near Manyata Tech park, Rooparam’s papers portrayed him as a resident of Ashirwad Layout in Hoodi and Balbir’s stated that he was a resident of CV Raman Nagar.

However, officials doubted the veracity of the papers as the men weren’t conversant in Kannada. They verified the documents and found that they were forged.

Anil Singh, an official at Detailed Medical Examination Board of CAPF, filed a complaint with Yelahanka police, who arrested the accused. A probe revealed that two persons, Surendra Katoch, a resident of Banaswadi and Chandu, a resident of JP Nagar, had got the trio the fake documents .

Police sources said it was easier to get a job in CAPF in Karnataka compared to Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan. The accused came to Bengaluru about six months ago and approached Surendra to get documents to show that they were residents of Karnataka. Each of them had paid Surendra Rs 20,000.

Police said they have sent the accused to judicial custody and are searching for Surendra and Chandu.

TimesView The need of the hour is that more people to stand up and peacefully protest against those felling trees illegally. Once a large number of people demand that the trees next to their homes and offices are protected, governments will be forced to act against this green murder. While it is good that Telangana government has schemes like Haritha Haram, the point will be lost if prohibitive penalties are not imposed on those cutting trees indiscriminately.

HYDERABAD: Residents of Meenakshi Trident Towers in Gachibowli were in for a rude shock when a bulldozer rolled in at 1.30am on Wednesday. When they stepped out to see what the commotion was all about, they realised trees adjacent to their compound wall were being felled indiscriminately. “They chopped about 15 to 20 trees at night. Could these trees not have been translocated?” asked Sumant Pinnamaneni, general secretary of Meenakshi Trident towers.When questioned, the supervisor in-charge of the felling said that it was being done for a pipeline to be laid. The supervisor, however, could not produce the requisite documents showing permission for the chopping of trees. “The road connects several communities. It sees heavy traffic every day. The people chopping the trees were working in a private capacity. They must have felt their work would go unnoticed in the wee hours of the morning,” said Satish Vakati, president of the residents’ associationSpeaking about the destruction of green cover in the are, Vakati said: “These were canopied trees which are rich in biodiversity. The workers said they would chop more trees in the coming days, even those right in front of our community.” Stating that residents must be given forewarning about such activities, one of the residents, Sandeep Ramkrishnan said: “The city already has minimal green spread. If trees are chopped as and when one pleases, there is no saving us.”Tweeting about the incident, Uday Krishna of the Vata Foundation, which helps in translocation of trees, said: “Dark Secret: while bosses talk about increasing green cover.. the lieutenants destroy existing trees under the cover of darkness. Trees being cut illegally last night... Will translocation never be considered?” He confirmed that the trees cut were Gulmohars.When contacted, forest officials said that no permission had been given for felling. “Our officers will inspect the site today (Wednesday) and confirm the legality,” said forest section officer for the area, Srikanth.",hyderabad,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73973480,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-39657,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/in-gachibowli-trees-felled-in-dead-of-night-but-supervisor-had-no-papers/articleshow/73969160.cms

Rubab players at Sarhad School in Katraj

PUNE: As the Kashmir Valley was under lockdown for much of the second half of 2019, Abdul Hamid Bhat’s travel plans ended up in a flaming mess. His planned performance tour across the country and world, showcasing the signature Kashmiri rubab , crashed and burned.

“The situation was not great. I had many performances lined up in India, even in the United States. But because of the shutdown, we could get nothing done. All phone lines were down and we could not travel anywhere, including to the United States or even to Pune. This concert is happening after the third attempt at organizing it,” Bhat said, speaking about his upcoming concert on Friday in Pune.

Bhat will also receive an award for communal harmony from the cultural organization Sarhad. The award, quite fittingly, is named after Bhai Mardana, the disciple of the founder of Sikhism Guru Nanak. Bhai Mardana, who was born into a Muslim family, played the rubab and sang the word of Nanak, preaching communal harmony.

Bhat, 45, his 25 year-old cousin and protégé Yawar, and others in his travelling party to this city, are almost of royalty when it comes to the Kashmiri variant of the rubab, the lutelike instrument that originated in Afghanistan. In fact, it has become almost a national symbol of that country. In the Kashmir valley, the instrument is also a cultural icon and Bhat’s ancestors have played no small part in keeping the rubab alive and relevant.

Bhat’s grandfather Sanaullah, an artist with the All India Radio, manufactured Kashmiri rubabs at their home in Kreeri, a hamlet in the Baramulla district of Jammu and Kashmir. With him, a gharana developed, and their distinctive style of rubabs they manufactured, as well as the performances, won them many audiences and fans around the world. Sanaullah had even worked with legends of Indian popular and classical music, including Asha Bhosle and Begum Akhtar.

The pietra dura-like work on the body is an alluring a sight as the melody generated through the 17 strings, amplified with a goatskin sound box. But it has not attract much government support, much to the dismay of Bhat and Yawar.

“Rubabs are a dying art. We are trying our best to keep it alive. Though it can be of enormous tourism potential, no government has done enough to sustain the art or support it. In the 1950s, our guru Sanaullah Bhat performed for Jawaharlal Nehru, who was very impressed and promised to support him. Sanaullah declined any support, because he just wanted to play the rubab. We want to set up an academy in Baramulla but nothing has moved with any government until now,” said Yawar.

Bengaluru: A 33-year-old techie who was on the run after allegedly bludgeoning her mother to death and attempting to murder her brother at their house near KR Puram early on Sunday was arrested along with her friend from a hotel in Port Blair, Andaman and Nicobar Islands, on Wednesday morning.

C Amruta and Sridhar Rao were produced before a court in Port Blair to get a transit warrant, deputy commissioner of police (Whitefield) MN Anuchet said. Police initially thought she had committed the crime as she was unable to repay a loan of Rs 15 lakh and feared being humiliated by the lenders.

“But now we strongly suspect that Amruta and Rao were in a relationship, which was opposed by her mother and brother. We don’t see any other reason for her to attack her family members. We can get more details only after questioning the duo,” another police officer said, adding, “The most important question is: Did Rao know Amruta was going to kill her mother? Or he got to know about it only later? He’d booked their air tickets to Port Blair on January 31 itself.”

Rao and Amruta worked together in a software company in Whitefield till 2017. “Then they joined different firms and were in constant touch,” police said.

Preliminary probe revealed the duo flew to Port Blair by catching a flight from Kempegowda International Airport (KIA) at 6.30am on Sunday. CCTV footage had shown Rao — wearing a full-face helmet and carrying a backpack — waiting near Amruta’s house on a gearless scooter on Sunday morning. After she arrived, they chatted for a while before riding away. They arrived at KIA on the same bike, police said.

“We checked the passengers’ list at KIA for that day and found Amruta’s name. With the help of Port Blair police, we traced the duo to a hotel,” an investigating officer said.

On Sunday morning, Amruta hit her 54-year-old mother C Nirmala on the head with a digging bar. She later stabbed her younger brother C Harish in the neck. Harish collapsed and thinking that he was dead, she left the house.

In his statement to police, Harish stated, “Around 4.30am, Amruta entered my room and stabbed me. I asked her what was wrong. She said she had a debt of Rs 15 lakh and didn’t want the debtors to harass me and our mother.”

HYDERABAD: From using transparent partitions inside trap cages to covering the traps with camouflage-patterned cloth, the forest department has been trying several innovative methods to capture the elusive male leopard that has killed 56 animals and has been giving sleepless nights to villagers in Rangareddy district over the past one year. Now in another unusual method, forest officials are trying to draw the big cat close to the trap cages by sprinkling urine sample of a female leopard in the area where it made its last kill.

“Leopards are very intelligent animals and this one refuses to fall prey to traps and even ignored a wide variety of live baits left inside cages. We are now trying to draw the leopard close to cages by sprinkling urine samples of a female leopard that we procured from the Nehru Zoological Park ,” forest divisional officer of Amangal, M Janakiram told TOI.

“Female leopards leave a scent in their urine which will indicate to the male that she is ready to mate. This method was suggested to us by a few experts. We are trying everything and any idea that might work,” Janakiram said. However, all traps have failed to lure this leopard since it made its first kill in January last year.

The leopard which has been lurking in Yacharam, Kadthal and Kandukur mandals of Rangareddy district made its last kill on Saturday in Mangalpally village of Amangal mandal by jumping over a 6ft fence and killing six goats in one go.

“Forest officials are placing camera traps and trap cages in the area after every kill but the leopard is not returning to the same village again. They have tried leaving the left-over prey in the same spot every time after the leopard killed the cattle in the villages hoping that it will come back to finish its kill but they had to eventually accept defeat after waiting for two or three days. Even the tranquillising teams had to return after spending several nights in the villages after the kill a few months ago,” said Mirza Kareem Baig, a member of the Forest and Wildlife Protection Society (FAWPS).

“Leopards think more than once before entering an area that looks suspicious. We are hoping that the new methods being implemented by forest officials will help capture the leopard soon so that they can safely relocate it inside the forest,” said Baig.

BENGALURU: A woman with a few lakh followers on video-sharing app TikTok chose to part ways with her husband of 12 years after he vehemently objected to her posting videos that he termed were ‘damaging to family values.’

Faris and Najma (both names changed) entered into wedlock in the summer of 2008 and lived in a joint family in central Bengaluru. A sales representative, Faris landed a job in Saudi Arabia and shifted to the Gulf nation leaving his wife with her parents. The couple was blessed with a baby boy in 2014.

“Three years ago, the woman’s neighbour introduced her to TikTok and she instantly got hooked to it. With a pseudo handle, she started making videos and enjoying the online attention she was receiving in terms of followers and likes,” said Ekbal Ahmed, a senior counsellor at Parihar family counselling centre at the police commissionerate. He handled the couple’s case after they approached the centre to settle their differences.

Earlier in 2019, Faris, amid work in Riyadh, received a shocker when a friend from back home sent him a TikTok video of a woman allegedly performing an obscene dance. “He couldn’t believe it when his friend told him it was his wife who was performing in the video, which had received lakhs of likes and elicited thousands of lewd comments on TikTok. He confronted his wife through phone and video calls only to hear her blaming the friend, who she said was making mischief by morphing her images on to lewd dance moves,” Ahmed added.

Unconvinced by his wife’s protestations, Faris quit his well-paying job and flew down to Bengaluru in early October. He confronted Najma with numerous videos of hers on TikTok but she burst into tears accusing him of doubting her. Finally, one video made in their house exposed Najma’s lies.

“She finally admitted to having made and posted numerous videos, including obscene ones, due to the response and popularity she received on TikTok. The husband then approached police, who referred the matter to us. We tried to reconcile the couple through counselling,” said the senior counsellor.

But the woman was determined to continue being on TikTok and didn’t want to forgo lakhs of fans who had lauded her performances over the years.

“We have come across numerous cases of social media related marital discord in recent months and have to handle each one with utmost care. No one can be blamed for their individual actions and we can only try to bring about an amicable solution through counselling. The aim is to save the relationship or marriage by mending whatever differences there may be,” said Rani Shetty, head of Parihar.

The couple is headed for divorce and is set to battle it out over their son’s custody.

The patients have been kept in the isolation wards at the state-run Gandhi and Fever hospitals. Of the 12, three are said to be air-hostesses with a prominent airline.“Of the 12, eight people have been admitted to Gandhi Hospital while the remaining four are at Fever Hospital. Their samples have been collected and are undergoing tests. The samples of 25 others have tested negative for the virus,” said Vijay Kumar, state nodal officer for Corona. While most of these people walked into the hospitals with complaints of fever, on Wednesday, some of them were picked up by the Integrated Disease Surveillance Programme teams.Meanwhile, in wake of the novel Coronavirus vigil resulting in many suspected patients being put in isolation facilities, district officials have now been asked to prepare teams to manage post traumatic events and stress during quarantine. So far, around 60 people who returned from Wuhan and other parts of China were kept in isolation wards (briefly) while many were asked to maintain self-quarantine at home for 28 days.“Isolation even for 24 hours is likely to have a psychological impact. A person in quarantine is not even allowed to interact with family members and exposure to doctors or nurses is minimal. This causes immense stress to many people who have never been on their own, without any contact with the outside world for even a few hours. Moreover, the number of suspected cases are on the rise and going by number of people who have returned from China as well as other affected countries, people observing self-quarantine will be in thousands,” said a senior health department official, speaking about the reason for the move.In fact, similar orders have also been given by the Kerala government in its action plan to tackle the outbreak of Novel Coronavirus. The Telangana health department is closely following the action plan of Kerala in preparation for an outbreak.

PUDUCHERRY: Lieutenant governor Kiran Bedi has refuted charges of running a ‘parallel government’ levelled by the council of ministers headed by chief minister V Narayanasamy and said as a public servant she was bound to act as per laws, rules and regulations.

Speaking to reporters after releasing books published by Raj Nivas on Wednesday, Bedi reiterated that as a lieutenant governor she does not enjoy immunity while a full-fledged governor does. “I don’t have any immunity and any wrongdoing can invite punishment. My responsibilities on financial matters are higher,” she said.

When queried about the Union home ministry’s direction to delegate more financial powers to ministers and secretaries to the government, Bedi said she did so but with riders on some matters like sanctioning grant-in-aid.

Bedi said differences between Raj Nivas and the council of ministers are bound to occur as everyone reads the laws, rules and regulations as it suits them.

She expressed optimism that the Madras high court will pass a final verdict on the case challenging the powers of the lieutenant governor. “Let the court decide on the issue,” she said.

She maintained that she was bound to refer the issues on which the lieutenant governor and the council of ministers have differences to the Union home ministry. The ministry on some issues took the stand of the council of ministers and on other occasions of the lieutenant governor.

Bedi underscored that she was here not to compete with anybody but to serve the Union territory and its people.

“Our objective is to make the Union territory better. I am not here to compete but to serve. There is no ego involved in it,” she said.

She released a book titled ‘Tracking the News’ published by Raj Nivas. The book is a thematic compilation of selected news reports on a wide range of issues, including the power tussle between Raj Nivas and the council of ministers, published by English and Tamil newspapers in 2019.

She also released a book that outlined the public grievance system in place at Raj Nivas.

Representative image

The Madras high court will hear the plea challenging the release of 13 convicts who were involved in the Melavalavu massacre case , on February 18.

A public interest litigation (PIL) was filed by advocate P Rathinam, appearing as party-in-person challenging the GOs passed for the premature release of the 13 convicts.

The case involves the massacre of six dalits at Melavalavu on June 30, 1997, by members of another caste following the election of a dalit as the village council president. The state government released all the 13 convicts citing good conduct in November 2019.

During the course of hearing, a division bench directed the 13 convicts not to enter Melavalavu village in Madurai district and that they should stay at Vellore district till the disposal of this petition. The court also directed that they should report before the Vellore district probation officer on the second and fourth Sundays and before the Vellore superintendent of police on the first and third Sundays.

During the previous hearing, when the case was placed before a division bench of justice S S Sundar and justice A D Jagadish Chandira, justice S S Sundar had recused himself from hearing the case and asked the case to be placed before another bench, as the petitioner Rathinam raised concern over one of the judges hearing the case.

Hence, the case was listed before a division bench of justice R Subramanian and justice N Sathish Kumar. When the case was taken up for hearing on Wednesday, the judges adjourned the hearing to February 18.

288,['6/02/2020'],Tiger deaths: Families to be relocated to Thane,"This story is from February 6, 2020

Porvorim: The government is considering voluntary relocation of individuals and families living in and around critical areas of wildlife sanctuaries to circumvent human-wild animal conflict, chief minister Pramod Sawant told the state assembly on Wednesday.

It is one of the many measures planned by the government following the deaths of a tigress and three cubs near Golauli village adjoining Mhadei wildlife sanctuary last month.

“Forest department officials as well activists are in talks with the families to convince them to shift elsewhere. A revenue land in Thane village has been identified to relocate them,” Sawant said while replying to a calling attention motion moved by opposition members. Few BJP MLAs also spoke in support of the motion.

The families have reservation about relocating as they are worried about their livelihoods. The government will built cowsheds for these families, the chief minister said. Seven to eight spots have been identified where few families were found to be living in the wildlife sanctuary, he said.

Sawant said boundaries were not marked after wildlife sanctuaries were declared. “I have given directions to mark village boundaries to avoid man-animal conflict,” he said.

The chief minister rubbished the allegation by former deputy chief minister Vijai Sardesai who said mining lobbies, in league with local politicians, may be at work as they do not want a tiger corridor.

Sawant said police and forest department officials are investigating the incident.

Earlier, leader of opposition Digambar Kamat said the government failed to take immediate action, and the families affected – who lost their cattle in the tiger attacks – did not get compensation.

Sawant said principal chief conservator of forests (PCCF) which earlier did not have powers to pay compensation to affected families, have now been given the authority to do so.

He said the issue has been handled from a “humanitarian aspect” and all measures are being taken to ensure there is no “repeat” of such incidents in the future.

MUMBAI: An exhaustive survey by Mumbai traffic police has found gaps in road dividers at 177 locations across the city, many of them outside commercial establishments. The gaps are a concern for road safety as motorists, particularly two-wheeler riders, use them to take sudden U-turns . The list of all the locations has been sent to BMC. Traffic police said many of the gaps are unauthorized.Personnel from each of the 34 traffic chowkies were asked to inspect dividers in their jurisdictions. As many as 11 gaps were found in the divider near Saifee Hospital at Charni Road. Other locations were Lala Lajpatrai Road near Racecourse, Karnak bridge, Darbhanga House at Pedder Road, Mahalaxmi Junction, near Marathon Heights at Worli, Nanavati Hospital at Vile Parle, outside Oshiwara and Samta Nagar police stations and IIT-Bombay market gate, among others.“There are multiple gaps on Bhulabhai Desai Road. Besides being dangerous, it leads to big jams. It is also the main cause for delaying ambulances,” said Dinesh Joshi, a south Mumbai resident.“The function of every gap has to be defined and design interventions made. If a gap is not carefully designed, it puts the user in direct conflict with oncoming vehicles,” said Dhawal Ashar, a transport planner. Ex-corporator Nicholas Almeida recalled a 2016 case where a gap outside a bar was filled, at the owner’s request, as a BMC school was on the opposite side of the road. With the closure, the distance between the two increased to 150 metres, more than that required for excise licence.",mumbai,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73972436,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-666147,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/city-traffic-cops-identify-177-dangerous-gaps-in-dividers/articleshow/73969193.cms

Addressing a press conference late evening, BJP state president Sadanand Tanavade demanded necessary action against Khaunte.

Mahambre, who had addressed a press conference earlier in the day making allegations against Khaunte, said that the Independent MLA got into an altercation with him in the corridors of the assembly complex after the day’s proceedings were over.

While Tanavade said Khaunte is frustrated as he is out of power, Khaunte said BJP is frustrated as he and other opposition members had exposed the BJP government on various issues, including on mismanagement state’s finances. “These are BJP’s old tactics to level false allegations against opponents and to pressurise them into silence,” Khaunte said.

Representative image

VILLUPURAM: A day after a petrol outlet worker was murdered in a crude bomb and sickle attack in an alleged case of mistaken identity, the Villupuram district police, who collected CCTV camera footage from the spot, said the assailant who barged into the petrol pump office cabin was accused person Azhar, a notorious anti-social, and formed five special teams to apprehend the gang members behind the attack.

A police team also seized a car abandoned by the gang at Perangiyur on Chennai-Trichy national highway on Tuesday evening and retrieved blood-stained clothes and the sickle used by Azhar dumped in the vehicle before it was abandoned near the Thennpennai riverbank.

Police on Wednesday received a complaint regarding the murder from D Balasundaram, 24, a diesel pump operator and eyewitness. Based on this, the Villupuram taluk police registered a case under several sections against accused Azhar alias Emam ali, 26, a close associate of Irusappan, 48, another anti-social.

According to inspector Robinson, the investigation officer in the case, in 2018, the victim Srinivasan’s co-brother Prakash, who was the owner of the petrol pump (Nagalakshmi Petro Fuels) located at Kamban Nagar, was issued a death threat by Azhar demanding Rs 20 lakh.

Despite several warnings by the gang of racketeers, Prakash told police about the extortion bid, enraging Azhar, who hurled a crude bomb on his neighbor’s house mistaking it to be Prakash’s residence. Though two of his associates were arrested, Azhar was absconding. To avenge the 2018 incident, Azhar who decided to murder Prakash, mistakenly killed his co-brother Srinivasan on Tuesday. Speaking to TOI, SP S Jayakumar said based on Balasundaram’s complaint, police booked a case against Azhar and his associates under Sections 147, 148, 449, 506(ii), 302 of IPC and Section 3 and 4(a) of the Explosive Substance Act, 1908.

“We have formed five special teams and based on reliable information, a hunt is on in places, including Dindugal, Chengalpet and its surrounding areas. The accused would be arrested at the earliest,” he said.

293,['6/02/2020'],"Despite economic slowdown, infra projects did not suffer: Goa CM","This story is from February 6, 2020

Pramod Sawant in assembly

PORVORIM: Chief minister Pramod Sawant on Wednesday said that the economic slowdown had resulted in reduced tourist footfalls to the state, but despite financial difficulties the state government ensured that there was no shortage of funds for infrastructure projects.

Responding to criticism from the opposition, he said “I have completed 10 months as CM. There are works pending for 15 to 20 years. But it is portrayed as if all these issues have arisen only in the last few months.”

By May 2021, the state government will meet requirements of individual toilets and, by March 2020, 100% of Goa will receive potable water supply, Sawant said replying to a three-day discussion on motion of thanks to governor ’s address.

On enforcing the GST regimen, Sawant said the government is set to adopt a very strict attitude. “There is repeated criticism of GST and VAT collection. Even now many who have business turnover of more than Rs 40 lakh have not registered. We want to tighten enforcement in the next two months. We will not think twice before imposing fines on such businessmen,” he said.

The chief minister said that nearly all tourism-related infrastructure projects are nearing completion in the coastal belt. “We are looking to resolve the taxi issue through GoaMiles. People are appreciating GoaMiles. We still need to further tighten the security for tourists,” Sawant said.

With respect to keeping the drug trade under check, he said that Goa being a touristic state it makes the task a bigger challenge as “it is not possible to check each one entering the state”.

“I am not saying there is no drugs trade. Because it is present, it is being caught. We are also disposing it immediately now and under proper monitoring. Earlier drugs seized would remain even up to two years. ANC is very sensitive to drug-related matters. I have told them that they have to be stricter,” Sawant said.

He asked the people to be vigilant when employing migrants as records showed that 85% of the crimes in the state were committed by them. “We need migrants to do our work,” the chief minister said.

On repairing roads, an issue that drew the government a lot of flak, he said that all remaining repair works will be completed by April-May.

He said the super speciality and cancer hospitals will be completed at the earliest. “We have decided to do major changes in education, like introducing post graduate for courses like architecture. Also, through GIPPARD we will train government staff,” he said.

Speaking about the anti-CAA comments made by some MLAs during the discussions in the House, Sawant said, “I was born in Cotombi. I am not born in a foreign country. We should keep the sanctity of this House.

294,['6/02/2020'],With 225 species Mandsaur may have a bird sanctuary,"This story is from February 6, 2020

Thousands of birds of 225 species were sighted in the area

INDORE: Thousands of birds of at least 225 species have found Mandsaur ’s Gandhi Sagar area as their preferred home this season. Presence of such large number of species of birds has prompted district administration to explore ways to develop the area as a bird sanctuary.

“In recent past, Gandhi Sagar area has witnessed arrival of large number of birds due to availability of water and wide range of flora and fauna. In the second survey by experts, presence of local and migratory birds of 225 species have been identified,” collector Manoj Pushp told TOI.

In the survey carried out between January 31 and February 2, around 125 ornithologists from across the country, did the bird count. Under guidance of forest officials, they were divided into 24 teams for counting of birds from 6am to 6pm in different parts of Gandhi Sagar wildlife sanctuary. During the survey, species including Indian spotted creeper, black-capped kingfisher, black-necked stork, dunlin, common rosefinch and other ‘rare’ birds were spotted.

“Mandsaur has huge potential to be developed as a major tourist destination due to Gandhi Sagar Dam, wildlife sanctuary, monuments of archaeological importance, historic buildings and religious structures along with Pashupatinath temple. But in absence of direct connectivity of airlines and other modes of transportation, it could not be explored much,” said Mandsaur collector Manoj Pushp.

He hopes that Delhi-Mumbai Expressway, which will pass through Mandsaur, will help in overall development of the district. Buoyed up by passing of Delhi-Mumbai Expressway from the district, the administration has already sent a proposal to the cultural department to develop Gandhi Sagar-Dharmrajeshwar Circuit and Pashupatinath Circuit.

Arrival of large number of locals and migratory birds in Mandsaur has boosted their morale to develop the place as a major tourist destinations. “Besides development of Gandhi Sagar-Dharmrajeshwar Circuit and Pashupatinath Circuit as major tourist destinations, we are encouraging local businessmen and investors to develop projects like resorts, hotels, recreation centres alongside the proposed expressway. A survey of structures of historical and archaeological importance is also underway for their conservation with the help of locals,” Pushp said.

296,['6/02/2020'],‘Need to involve locals in Nagpur’s development’,"This story is from February 6, 2020

Should road and bridge construction agencies do a traffic survey before constructing a new one?

Yes, of course. Before commencing any project, each concerned government agency should do a proper planning and survey. Many projects have come up in the city without proper planning and survey. It is general problem in Nagpur. Not only surveys, even planning for any project is not being done properly.

Should this survey be made public and, suggestions and objections be invited on it even from the traffic police?

There should be public participation in the planning process. Whenever any development plan is prepared there are a lot of provisions which are not disclosed to common public. When the Munje Road was widened under IRDP project, there was a provision in the development plan to make the Sitabuldi main road only for pedestrians. But it was neither implemented nor disclosed. Had citizens been involved, ill-planned infrastructure work could have been averted.

How does one stop construction of ill-planned roads and bridges ?

Civilized and developed countries have a planning department which help in planning roads, gardens, flyovers etc. Sadly, Nagpur city has no proper town planning department. NMC’s town planning department functions only for the sake of sanctioning maps. To stop ill-planned projects, first we need a town planner’s office in every city like Nagpur.

MahaMetro will demolish the station road flyover for road widening. The money spent on its construction will go waste. Who is responsible for this loss?

During early 2000, there was no development works going on in the city. So the flyover was accepted by all. If something happens everybody is ready to support. The attitude of citizens is responsible for the ill-planned development. City is witnessing ad hoc planning. Cement road construction is another glaring example which is causing floods across the city. The root cause of ill-planned structures like the flyover in front of railway station is that bureaucrats cannot defy the diktats of politicians.

Can you suggest solutions to solve the traffic mess created due to unscientific construction of Sadar flyover, Ram Jhula, road through Central Jail etc?

Nowadays, everyone is working to expedite the completion of a project. There has to be a comprehensive plan for any project. Already international and Indian standards are in place there but, ironically, none of the agencies follows them. Once constructed without proper planning, any project be it Sadar flyover, there is no solution to rectify the mistake. The only solution is to involve citizens and organizations like Institution of Engineers or premier educational institutions like VNIT before commencing any project.

Panaji: The assembly on Wednesday passed the Goa Cooperative Societies (Amendment) Bill, 2020. Chief minister Pramod Sawant, responding to apprehensions by Curtorim MLA Aleixo Reginaldo Lourenco, said that the amendment was only to allow a member of the apex cooperative body to serve on the primary body in a managerial position as well.

Reginaldo said that administrative issues have already adversely affected many cooperative societies in the state.

Cooperation minister Govind Gaude earlier introduced the Goa Cooperative Societies (Amendment) Bill, 2020, which omits the fourth proviso to sub-section of Section 59 of the Goa Cooperative Societies Act.

It enables the board of directors of the apex or federal co-operative society to also enjoy managerial rights in an individual capacity over such primary cooperative society.

Goa's chief minister Pramod Sawant

PORVORIM: Following objections from the opposition benches, chief minister Pramod Sawant on Wednesday agreed to refer the amendment to the Goa Essential Services Maintenance Bill, 2020, to a select committee.

Sawant made the announcement after opposition members said the purpose of the amendments — an increase in jail term from 6 months to 3 years — was not clear.

“Why don’t you send it to a select committee? Increasing jail term for ESMA violations from six months to three years absolutely sends a wrong message to society,” said leader of opposition Digambar Kamat. “What is its purpose, I don’t know. How many persons arrested under the act till now were kept in jail even for ten days or a month? Even recently, those arrested for a bus strike were released within a night.”

Ponda MLA Ravi Naik said that if a government servant is kept in jail for three years for violation of ESMA, it is not clear whether or not their job would remain at the end of this period.

Porvorim MLA Rohan Khaunte said that sending the bill to a select committee will help understand the purpose of the amendments proposed in the bill. “Necessary laws like the Panchayat Act, etc, are not being passed. What is the purpose of pushing this bill first, and in such a hurry?” Khaunte asked.

The bill proposes amendments to Sections 4, 5 and 6 of the Goa Essential Services Maintenance Act. The amendments are to increase the punishment provided in the sections to a three-year jail term and a minimum fine of Rs 5,000, for violating provisions of the ESMA Act.

The bill states that the amendment is “so as to have a deterrent effect and for the prevention of offences”. It also proposes an amendment to Section 9 of the principal act, making the offence cognisable and non-bailable.

NEW DELHI: Delhi Police has taken the voice samples of Sharjeel Imam and would match them with the videos of his speeches at Shaheen Bagh and Aligarh. The samples will be used to analyse some phone recordings and voice chats as part of a probe to ascertain his role during the clashes at Shaheen Bagh.

His social media profiles are, meanwhile, being scanned to identify his associates. The special investigation team is also probing his association with groups like Popular Front of India and Islamic Youth Federation.

During interrogation, Sharjeel mentioned the names of three of his associates, who helped him in his research before he gave the speeches at Jamia and Aligarh universities. Efforts are being made to track down his associates, including a former classmate.

Sharjeel had earlier claimed that he was inspired by some social theories based on a 1890 document. He felt the policies of the government were against his communities. He went ahead with his activities despite being aware that he might land up in jail on sedition charges, sources added.

During the interrogation on Thursday, the cops recorded Sharjeel’s voice samples and sent them for an analysis. They would be matched with that of the videos. The videos of his speeches have been sent to Central Forensic Science Laboratory for an authenticity verification.

Sharjeel is also being questioned by the cops about the friends, who helped him evade the police during the raids.

Representative image

The transplant authority of Tamil Nadu has given permission to the Coimbatore Medical College Hospital (CMCH) to perform liver and heart transplants. Now that the hospital has performed its first cadaver harvest surgery, it plans to start liver transplant programme as well soon. The hospital had applied for permission to start liver transplants in 2018-end.

Speaking to TOI, dean of the hospital Dr B Ashokan said the liver from the donor, Siva Perumal, had been allotted to a patient in Kovai Medical Centre and Hospital, because the donor’s blood group did not match with those of their liver failure patients. “We started our liver treatment programme around a year back, and some of our patients have also been put on TRANSTAN waiting list. However, the top patient who was ready did not match with the donor, so we had to give away the liver,” he said. “However, we hope that the next time we get a cadaver organ harvesting in our hospital, we can retain the liver for our own patients,” he added.

Liver transplants in the district and region are only being performed by private hospitals. “We have well-equipped intensive care units, ventilators, staff and surgeons who have trained at Stanley Medical College and under liver transplant expert Dr Mohammed Rela himself. We have created an exclusive ICU for liver transplant patients to prevent the risk of infections,” said Dr Ashokan, during an earlier interaction with TOI.

The GH performing transplants is critical, because a liver transplant costs at least Rs 25 lakh in private hospitals and a kidney transplant costs Rs 3.5 lakh. Though both procedures are covered by the Tamil Nadu Comprehensive Health Insurance Scheme, many hospitals perform very few procedures under the government insurance. “The state insurance scheme rarely covers 75% of all costs incurred, and we are not allowed to demand extra payments also. So, we have a limit on the number of cases done under the insurance scheme and some patients have to be refused because of it,” said a coordinator of a multi-specialty hospital on Avinashi Road.

The mayor will now be a candidate from BCM ‘A’ category and deputy mayor a woman from the general category

MANGALURU: The urban development department has cleared the decks for the election of a new city mayor. A direction from the principal secretary to the commissioner, Mangaluru City Corporation, on February 3, to proceed with the election to the post of mayor and deputy mayor as per the reservation roster for the 21st term dated September 3, 2018, has set to rest doubts about confusion that prevailed on the roster that the civic body had to follow.

Accordingly, the mayor will now be a candidate from BCM ‘A’ category and deputy mayor a woman from the general category.

The February 3 letter reminded Shanady Ajith Kumar Hegde , the commissioner, that the civic body was yet to conduct an election for the posts as per the roster for the 21st term, and the same must be followed. The principal secretary also directed Hegde to take steps to ensure that the elections to the posts are conducted forthwith.

The confusion arose when the BJP government on December 26, 2019, issued the reservation roster for the post of mayor and deputy mayor for 11 city corporations, including Mangaluru, for the 22nd term. The officials were in a dilemma on going ahead with the elections with the reservation that reserved the post of mayor for the general category and that of deputy mayor for general woman candidate, as MCC was yet to hold elections as per the roster for the 21st term.

Ajith Kumar Hegde said based on directions from the principal secretary, MCC on Tuesday has written a letter to the regional commissioner, Mysuru, to fix the date for the elections. It is now up to the regional commissioner to take forward the election process, he said.

BJP swept the elections to the 60-member council held on November 12, winning 44 wards and relegating the ruling Congress to 14 wards. Social Democratic Party of India won two seats.

Dr Y Bharath Shetty , Mangaluru City North MLA, told TOI that the party will take a call on the mayoral candidate once the regional commissioner notifies the election date. Asserting that no names have been finalised, Dr Shetty said the party will strive to meet the assurances given to the electorate in the party manifesto, and provide a clean and transparent administration. This is for the second time in MCC’s history that the BJP has come to power.

COIMBATORE: The mahila court on Wednesday sentenced a 35-year-old man to 10 years rigorous imprisonment for abetting the suicide of his wife in 2013.

Police identified him as S Shanmuganandam of Nandha Nagar in Singanallaur. “He had married Sujatha in 2007. Following a quarrel in March 2013, Sujatha left her husband and, along with their child, began to stay with her parents at their house at Gandhi Managar in the city. Shanmuganandam had been forcing her to bring the child to meet his parents. She was frustrated by the constant pestering and was not able to concentrate on her job. On April 26, 2013, Sujatha was waiting at the Nava India bus stop near Peelamedu to catch a bus to her home. Shanmuganandam called her in her mobile phone and again forced her to bring their child. She had a quarrel with him,” a police officer said.

A depressed Sujatha consumed cow dung powder, a poisonous synthetic dye used as a colouring agent, right at the bus stop. Though she was admitted to a private hospital in the area, she passed away on May 2.

Based on her account, the Coimbatore all women police filed a case against Shanmuganandam for abetting Sujatha’s suicide and arrested him.

On Wednesday, mahila court judge J Radhika awarded 10 years rigorous imprisonment to Shanmuganandam and also slapped him with a fine of Rs 5,000.

COIMBATORE: For the first time, the Coimbatore Medical College Hospital (CMCH) on Wednesday declared a patient brain dead and harvested his organs.

The donor patient, a 35-year-old man from Kattabettu in the Nilgiris, had fallen from the top of his under-construction house.

While the CMCH doctors transplanted a kidney into one of their kidney failure patients, the other kidney was donated to a patient in Salem Government Hospital and liver was donated to a private hospital in the city.

Though doctors at CMCH began performing live donor kidney transplants in 2017, they are yet to perform a cadaver transplant as they are yet to harvest organs from a brain-dead patient. However, doctors at Salem GH have had performed first organ harvest on January 21 this year.

Welcoming the first cadaver organ transplant in CMCH, a senior health department official said, “It is critical that government hospitals perform organ harvests, because this way even poor people can access cadaver organs. Only when a GH declares brain death and donates organs, will more organs circulate in the government hospital pool benefitting poor patients.”

CMCH dean Dr B Ashokan said they received a 35-year-old male patient referred from Ooty on February 2. “He had fallen accidentally from a height in his house and suffered head injuries. He was referred to CMCH after being given first aid in a nearby hospital,” he said. “Despite our neurology team treating him, he did not respond,” he said. On Tuesday morning, 48 hours after the accident, doctors performed the first sleep apnea test. By evening, they performed the second test again which elicited no response. The doctors declared him brain dead on Tuesday evening. The hospital’s grief counsellor, appointed by MOHAN foundation, Nishanth, first informed their family and broached the subject of organ donation. The patient’s wife and relatives agreed, said the hospital’s medical superintendent.

The Tamil Nadu Transplant Authority (TRANSTAN) was then informed. They allotted one kidney to a patient in CMCH waiting for a donor, another kidney to a patient in Salem GH and liver to Kovai Medical Centre and Hospital.

Since it was an accidental death and a medico-legal case, it became an uphill task for the authorities to get nod from the Nilgiris police for organ harvest and post-mortem.

The organ harvest surgery began at 11am. By 2pm, the three organs and cornea were harvested. Police organized green corridors CMCH to KMCH and Salem GH. “This is the first time we are harvesting cadaver organs. We hope this is the start of a successful cadaver organ harvest and transplant program,” Dr Ashokan said.

SECUNDERABAD: Putting an end to uncertainty over the extension of term of the existing Secunderabad Cantonment Board ( SCB ) elected body, Ministry of Defence (MoD) issued orders on Wednesday, stating that the tenure has been extended for another six months.

Rajesh Kumar Sah, deputy director, D(Q&C), Department of Defence in an official communiqué said that it is not possible to hold elections in Cantonment Boards due to administrative reasons and that the Central government has extended the term of offices of all elected members of 55 Cantonment Boards. The extension period will last for six months or till the date of constitution of the Board (whichever is earlier).

Due to the extension, election in eight civilian SCB wards has been deferred. The MoD was supposed to issue an election notification this week for the ensuing elections, said officials.

Cantonment Board officials had completed the process of ward reservation as well as updation of voters’ list nearly two months ago.

Welcoming MoD’s decision on the extension of tenure for another six months, SCB vice president, J Ramakrishna said, “We will complete all pending works in our respective wards.”

“With the extension of the tenure, the MoD gave scope to the present elected body to take up various developmental activities in all eight Cantonment Board wards,” said J Surana, vice president, All India Cantonments Residential Welfare Associations.

Meanwhile, few current ward members said that though they welcome the MoD’s decision to extend the tenure, it is upsetting that the announcement was made much after preparations for elections began. Members said that as they had started campaigning, the decision came as a shock.

CHANDIGARH: As many as 81 teenagers reportedly committed suicide from January 2015 to December 31, 2019, in the city, in grim figures that have prompted experts to ask parents, teachers, siblings and friends to look out for warning signs like poor eating habits, depression, short temper and mood swings.Multiple reasons are cited for children taking the drastic step. Dr B S Chavan, psychiatrist, Government Medical College and Hospital, Sector 32, lists six — academic pressure, frequent break-ups in relationships, poor tolerance and aggression, parents not paying attention, alcohol abuse and easy access to means of suicide, like firearms. Professor Adarsh Kohli, a clinical psychologist, PGI, called frustration owing to unfulfilled ambitions and failed relationships the key reasons behind teen suicides — the most (25) took place in 2017.Eighteen children took their lives in 2015, 11 in 2016, 12 in 2018 and 15 last year, according to the data. As many as 39 victims were in the age group of 16 to 18 years, 27 in the 14 to 16, 11 in the 12 to 14 and four in the 8 to 12 age bracket, police said. Hanging was the most common mode followed by consuming poisonous substances and jumping into lake or buildings. Experts said schools can play a major role in detecting whether a child is troubled or not.On its part, the UT administration has appointed counsellors in government schools to help students cope up with exam stress and observe the signs of suicides or stress. Prabhjot Kaur, a counsellor in a government school, said they regularly give special lectures to students of classes V to XII on stress management and monitor each one of them. During parent-teacher meetings, parents are told about not putting undue pressure on their wards for studies, she said. Counsellors said they also receive cases of bullying among the students by their classmates or friends. Bullying leads to distress and anxiety among children and can drive some of the children to suicide, experts said.A few years back, an online game was blamed for a number of suicides among children in the country. In Blue Whale challenge, a designated curator assigns players various tasks over a 50-day period, culminating in the player committing suicide. However, no confirmed case of a child ending his life after playing the game had been officially reported in the Tricity. In Panchkula, a 15-year-old girl had allegedly set herself on fire at a park in Sector 7. Police had not ruled out online suicide game angle in the case. Police had sent her mobile phone to a laboratory in Gurugram to unlock it to obtain clues that could help them unravel the mysterious case — the girl had carried a brand new knife in her purse, took a solo and risky trip to a town in Himachal Pradesh at night and the manner in which she decided to end her life.MAIN CASESJanuary 23, 2020 | A 17-year-old Class XII student allegedly committed suicide by shooting himself with his father’s pistol at his house in Phase X, Mohali.

NEW DELHI: Former Congress president Rahul Gandhi on Wednesday said that while India’s youth demanded employment, progress and development, Prime Minister Narendra Modi got them beaten up and shot by police.While canvassing for Alka Lamba , the party candidate in Chandni Chowk, Gandhi told a gathering at Hauz Qazi that if India and Delhi weren’t developed as manufacturing hubs of the world and didn’t provide employment to the youth, then violence and hate would soon be 10 times greater than the current levels.He said that in another year, a never-heard-before voice would emerge and “ask Narendra Modi to stand aside and give employment to the youth. Only then will India get back on the right track”.He added: “The only challenge before India is employment generation and, for this, we’ll have to dislodge both (Delhi CM Arvind) Kejriwal and Narendra Modi. This can only be done if Hindus, Muslims, Sikhs and Christians stick together.”Gandhi claimed that Modi spent all his time creating divisions. “And, then, he claims to be a deshbhakt,” he said. “Kejriwal and Modi teach us patriotism. Who are they teaching us deshbhakti? The country elected them to work and they failed completely.” He claimed that Modi’s entire politics fed on the oxygen of unemployment.Taking a dig at finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman, he said her 2.5-hour-long Budget speech was full of lies. “There are only two people who can speak endless lies. They are Kejriwal and Modi,” he said.Gandhi said the people of India could get angry with each other, but there was no hate. “There is a difference between gussa and nafrat. There was no hate between Hindus and Muslims between 2004 and 2014. Then Narendra Modi comes from Gujrat and spreads the poison everywhere.”He also raked up the controversy around PM’s degree. “While Modi teaches kids on how to clear exams through events such as Pariksha Pe Charcha, he also refuses to show his own degree to the nation,” he said.Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, who got delayed in joining her brother at Hauz Qazi, said she was late because BJP-AAP made no new roads. “If I had taken Sheila ji ki metro, I would have arrived in 10 minutes,” she said.Vadra said that Delhites had an important decision to make. “Delhi is India’s heart. You fought for independence and helped create the Constitution. This is a garden, you are the gardener and all types of flowers blossom here. This government wants to destroy the garden,” she said. “Earlier, we had slogans like jai jawan, jai kisan. Today we have goli maro... khoon se tilak karo.”She also presented a comparative report card of Congress and AAP and claimed that the former had outperformed on all parameters.Earlier, at a gathering in east Delhi’s Kondli, Gandhi claimed that he hadn’t uttered a single lie in his 15-year political career. “You will not find a single lie in Rahul Gandhi’s speeches. But, listen to Modi ji or Kejriwal and you will find lies. Don’t even listen to Amit Shah” he said. “The atmosphere has worsened in the last five years. What is the reason? Many will say it’s Modi or BJP . I will say the biggest reason is that the youth of India is unable to see the right path. He is afraid.

MADURAI: The Madras high court has ordered notice to the registrar (general) of principal seat and registrar (administration) of the Madurai bench while hearing a batch of petitions, which challenged the newly-notified High Court of Madras (Conduct of Proceedings by Party-In-Person) Rules, 2019.

The petitions were filed by ‘Traffic’ Ramasamy, K K Ramesh and A M Sundaravel who appeared as party-in-persons in several cases.

The petitioners stated that registrar general of Madras high court has put in place new guidelines which were recently notified in the Rules. As per this notification, a person who wants to appear as party-in-person should file an application attested by oath commissioner or notary and the party-in-person committee would scrutinize the papers and take a decision on allowing the person to appear as party-in-person or would offer legal services through the high court legal services committee.

They stated that any litigant has the right to represent himself before the court, however, the newly notified rules attempts to strike out an individual representing himself before the court. They stated that compelling a litigant to engage a lawyer is not correct.

Since these new guidelines would cause several hardships for the people appearing as party-in-persons, the petitioners moved the high court Madurai bench challenging the newly-notified rules.

When the petition was heard on Wednesday, a division bench of justices M Duraiswamy and T Ravindran ordered notice and adjourned the case to a further date for hearing.

ALL-OUT ATTACK: Priyanka Gandhi Vadra said she got late in joining Rahul Gandhi at Hauz Qazi because AAP and B... Read More

NEW DELHI: Former Congress president Rahul Gandhi on Wednesday said that while India’s youth demanded employment, progress and development, Prime Minister Narendra Modi got them beaten up and shot by police.

While canvassing for Alka Lamba , the party candidate in Chandni Chowk, Gandhi told a gathering at Hauz Qazi that if India and Delhi weren’t developed as manufacturing hubs of the world and didn’t provide employment to the youth, then violence and hate would soon be 10 times greater than the current levels.

He said that in another year, a never-heard-before voice would emerge and “ask Narendra Modi to stand aside and give employment to the youth. Only then will India get back on the right track”.

He added: “The only challenge before India is employment generation and, for this, we’ll have to dislodge both (Delhi CM Arvind) Kejriwal and Narendra Modi. This can only be done if Hindus, Muslims, Sikhs and Christians stick together.”

Gandhi claimed that Modi spent all his time creating divisions. “And, then, he claims to be a deshbhakt,” he said. “Kejriwal and Modi teach us patriotism. Who are they teaching us deshbhakti? The country elected them to work and they failed completely.” He claimed that Modi’s entire politics fed on the oxygen of unemployment.

Taking a dig at finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman, he said her 2.5-hour-long Budget speech was full of lies. “There are only two people who can speak endless lies. They are Kejriwal and Modi,” he said.

Gandhi said the people of India could get angry with each other, but there was no hate. “There is a difference between gussa and nafrat. There was no hate between Hindus and Muslims between 2004 and 2014. Then Narendra Modi comes from Gujrat and spreads the poison everywhere.”

He also raked up the controversy around PM’s degree. “While Modi teaches kids on how to clear exams through events such as Pariksha Pe Charcha, he also refuses to show his own degree to the nation,” he said.

Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, who got delayed in joining her brother at Hauz Qazi, said she was late because BJP-AAP made no new roads. “If I had taken Sheila ji ki metro, I would have arrived in 10 minutes,” she said.

Vadra said that Delhites had an important decision to make. “Delhi is India’s heart. You fought for independence and helped create the Constitution. This is a garden, you are the gardener and all types of flowers blossom here. This government wants to destroy the garden,” she said. “Earlier, we had slogans like jai jawan, jai kisan. Today we have goli maro... khoon se tilak karo.”

She also presented a comparative report card of Congress and AAP and claimed that the former had outperformed on all parameters.

Earlier, at a gathering in east Delhi’s Kondli, Gandhi claimed that he hadn’t uttered a single lie in his 15-year political career. “You will not find a single lie in Rahul Gandhi’s speeches. But, listen to Modi ji or Kejriwal and you will find lies. Don’t even listen to Amit Shah” he said. “The atmosphere has worsened in the last five years. What is the reason? Many will say it’s Modi or BJP . I will say the biggest reason is that the youth of India is unable to see the right path. He is afraid. He is afraid of unemployment,” Gandhi said.

INDORE: The Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (DRI) Indore Zonal Unit have arrested a passenger , who was trying to smuggle 612 gram of gold at Indore airport .

The passenger identified as Mohammad Vasim had hidden the gold worth Rs 25 lakh in metallic parts of portable speakers and mixer and juicer, an official release issued by DRI on Wednesday stated.

Vasim came to Indore from Dubai on an Air India flight (AI 904) on Tuesday night. He appeared to be suspicious and when the DRI officers searched him they recovered the gold from him. He wanted to carry the gold to New Delhi.

Recent seizures are indicative of increased smuggling of gold from foreign countries more specifically from Dubai.

One of the main reasons behind this is the considerable price difference between Indian and international market price of gold, the DRI said in its release.

This is not the first time when a passenger has been caught with large amount of gold. People come up with novel ways to hide gold. A week ago, the DRI Indore had intercepted a passenger and recovered around half a kilogram of gold from his rectum at Indore airport. He had concealed the gold in his rectum in form of paste capsule. He, too, had arrived from Dubai.

CHENNAI: Crime Branch-CID sleuths on Wednesday arrested two people, including a policeman, in connection with the TNPSC exam scam. With the arrest of the policeman in the exam scam, the total number of police personnel arrested in the case has reached three.

However, prime suspect Jayakumar is still on the run even as a special team has fanned out to trace him.

A press release from the Tamil Nadu Crime Branch CID said that the agency on Wednesday arrested policeman T Boopathy, an Armed Reserve constable from Chennai. He had allegedly collected a total of Rs 55 lakh from five people who appeared for the 2017 group 2A TNPSC examination and managed to get them jobs with the help of Jayakumar.

Police had also arrested V Karthik, who had paid Rs 9 lakh through Jayakumar and ‘cleared’ the 2017 exam indulging in malpractice to get appointed in the commercial tax department as an assistant.

The CB-CID further noted that policeman Sithandi, who was arrested from Sivaganga on Tuesday, had collected Rs 82.5 lakh from seven job aspirants who cleared the 2017 group 2A examination and were selected for government jobs then. Similarly, he had collected Rs 7.5 lakh each from 15 people and gave it to Jayakumar. Of the 15, only five were selected.

Meanwhile, the CB-CID intensified its hunt for Jayakumar, believed to be a native of Kerala and had settled in Chennai. Police, who believed that he had gone on pilgrimage, have been looking for him in all the neighbouring states. His photograph was circulated across the state borders.

So far, the Tamil Nadu CB-CID has arrested as many as 32 people in connection with two TNPSC examination scams after the authorities found that candidates who wrote the exam from a particular centre scored high ranks.

TNPSC had banned 99 candidates for life from the Group IV exam after it found that they had manipulated answers by using ‘special’ ink. These candidates from across the state had written the exam at Rameswaram and Keelakkarai centres in Ramanathapuram district as per the instructions of the scamsters. The answer sheets of 52 candidates out of the total 99 were manipulated by the gang who shaded correct responses after the scam.

Representative image

MADURAI: Taking serious note of the dereliction on part of the authorities in the maternal death of a woman at K Pudur urban primary health centre ( UPHC ) in September 2019, the Madras high court has sought explanations from the officials for the delay in informing the reasons to the woman’s husband.

S Manimuthu, a resident of K Pudur in Madurai , in his petition, stated that he got married to Sakthikali, 22, in 2018. After his wife became pregnant, she was going to the K Pudur UPHC for regular check-up. As his wife went into labour, she was admitted at the UPHC at September 14, 2019. The duty doctor who examined her stated that the delivery would be normal and there is no complication.

After the duty doctor left the UPHC premises, his wife started experiencing pain and a nurse examined her. Since the doctor did not come to the UPHC till 11pm, Manimuthu asked the nurse to shift his wife to the Government Rajaji Hospital (GRH), however, no steps were taken by the nurse to shift her.

Later, the nurse called him inside the UPHC and when he went inside, he noticed that his wife was lying in a pool of blood. He immediately rushed her to the GRH in an ambulance, however, the doctors declared that she was brought dead. He stated that based on his complaint, the K Pudur police have registered a case under Section 174 CrPC.

He stated that since his wife and his child died due to the negligence of the doctors, he sent a representation to the authorities concerned seeking to conduct judicial inquiry into his wife’s death. He further stated that the authorities concerned did not take any steps to issue the death certificate and postmortem report in order to bring out the truth and reasons for his wife’s death. He also stated that there was no response for the representation sent to the authorities in this regard.

Since no steps were taken, the petitioner moved the high court Madurai bench in 2019, seeking the state to provide a compensation of Rs 10 lakh as his wife died due to medical negligence. He further sought the authorities to issue the postmortem report and death certificate and also sought action against the duty doctor and nurse of K Pudur UPHC for their medical negligence.

When the petition was taken up for hearing on Tuesday, justice Pushpa Sathyanarayana directed the dean of GRH, multipurpose health supervisor of GRH and inspector of police of K Pudur police station to file an affidavit explaining as to why the reasons for the death of woman was not informed to the petitioner. The case was adjourned to February 11.

Meanwhile, officials had handed over the death certificate to Manimuthu on Tuesday, only after the court took a serious view in this matter.

COIMBATORE: As the financial year is coming to a close, city corporation officials are expediting property tax collection drive.

As on Monday, the corporation had collected Rs 122 crore as property tax, which is 62% of the total demand of Rs 197 crore. Last year, at the same time, the civic body had collected Rs 118 crore or 63% of the then the demand of Rs 187 crore.

Explaining that the number of assessments in the city increases with each passing day as the applications to levy property tax for new buildings is approved, a corporation official said that the demand for property tax would also increase along with the increase in assessments.

As on Monday, the city had 5.18 lakh assessments, including residential houses and commercial establishments.

The official said that the civic body had raised its property tax collection target from 95% to 97%, this year. “To achieve the target, we have set up special collection centres.”

As many as 29 collection centres are functioning across the city. They are open from 8am to 5pm from Monday to Saturday and even on Sundays from 8am to 2pm.

Until last year, the centres were functioning only from 9am to 2pm.

Meanwhile, the tax arrear demand is increasing every year. This year, the demand stands at Rs 32.58 crore, of which, the corporation has collected only Rs 8.26 crore, which is only 25% of the amount. “We have identified the top 100 defaulters in each zone and have issued notices to them,” the official added.

A couple of months ago, the state government had withheld its revised property tax in effect since April 2018 and had allowed property owners to pay the taxes at the pre-revision rates.

The result was announced by the literacy mission on Wednesday.

According to project co-coordinator Pradeep Kumar , Bhageerathiamma of Prakkulam in Kollam secured 74.5% marks in the exam .

The elderly woman, who studied till Class III at Prakkulam Govt LPS, had to give up her studies after her mother died and she had to take care of her siblings.

It was her friend Sarada teacher’s daughter and literacy mission master trainer S N Shirley and her husband and literacy mission’s key resource person K B Vasanthakumar who took the initiative to bring Bhageerathiamma, the mother of six and grandmother of 16, back to the world of letters.

A farmer in Devakottai using electric fans to thresh paddy.

MADURAI: Paddy farmers in Sivaganga complained that despite them reaping a good harvest this year, they are forced to spend extra as they have to use high power electric fans due to lack of high velocity winds needed for threshing the crop.

“Our lands have been barren for the last few years, as most of them are rain-fed, but this year we had a good cultivation yet we are struggling to get a profit,” said P Ashokumar of Kesani village near Kappalur in Devakottai taluk. He said that many of the farmers had managed to get a good yield, but because of the delay in procurement of the crop, the paddy was being attacked by a bacterial infection, which resulted in them developing black ball like spots. Fans are rented for Rs 500 per day, when the ordinary rent for the same is only Rs 200. A labourer has to thresh the paddy by standing in front of the fan and about a tonne of paddy can be threshed in a day from 8 am to 5 pm.

The representatives said that in some schools, as there are no OAs, teachers or clerks ring the school bell. “Chores such as collecting documents and communications from the district education offices are also now being done by teachers and clerks. These are jobs meant for office assistants,” said M Arunkumar, district president of the association. “The vacancies have not been filled in any of the high and higher secondary schools in the state. As many as 150 schools in the district don’t have OAs.”

Only half of the schools in the district have night watchmen, Arunkumar said. “This has created a sense of apprehension among HMs as there are possibilities of anti-social elements entering campuses at night. Night watchmen must be recruited soon,” he said. “Or, the state should allow government schools to hire them.”

Members of the association had put forth the demands to the Coimbatore chief education officer recently.

COIMBATORE: The city corporation is getting ready to commission its third solar plant at Ukkadam.

The 3.6MW plant is the largest the corporation has installed so far. It is being installed on the 15 acres of land adjacent to the sewage treatment plant (STP) at Ukkadam. The Rs 17 crore facility has 1,286 solar panels, each with a capacity of 320W.

Corporation commissioner J Sravan Kumar said that even though the deadline to complete the installation work is in June, work is almost complete. “The plant will start functioning within a month or two,” he said.

The civic body already runs two solar plants each with a capacity of 1MW at Ukkadam and Kavundampalayam, constructed at a cost of Rs 5.5 crore each. “It has been a year since the first solar power plant at Ukkadam started generating power. It generates 15 lakh units every month and is saving the corporation a huge sum, which otherwise would have gone towards paying electricity bill for operating the water pumping station at Velliangadu,” the commissioner said.

Pointing out the difference in power tariff based on consumption level, Kumar said that the move to use the power generated by the plant to offset the electricity bills of pumping station has benefited the corporation as the station has high-tension (HT) supply. “We hope to make the return of investment (RoI) in less than four years.”

The corporation has made use of the places once used as dump yards for setting up the plants. The plant at Kavundampalayam became operational less than a month ago.

The corporation had recently received an award from the ministry of housing and urban affairs for conserving the urban environment by installing solar power plants.

NEW DELHI: Delhi BJP chief Manoj Tiwari was in for a surprise on Wednesday when he saw that not more than 300 people had gathered to attend the rally scheduled in Delhi Cantonment .

He, however, promised to shift them all to pucca houses in two years if his party was voted to office.

Addressing the gathering there, Tiwari claimed that his party would solve all the problems faced by the local residents.

“BJP, in the past five years, made sure that the garbage was cleaned up regularly in the area. Our workers also ensured availability of mobile toilets for the convenience of everyone,” he said.

“Delhi chief minister says that every place in the city has electricity and water supply. Someone should just go and tell him that some places are still devoid of these two basic necessities,” he added.

Tiwari then spoke about “Jahan jhuggi, wahin makaan” scheme, promising all the slum dwellers pucca houses close to their shanties.

“All your worries will end if all of you have a two-room flat with access to electricity, gas connection and water at all times. Won’t these things make all of you happy? AAP government was elected from here last time but the face of this place has not changed a bit,” he claimed.

“This is Army land. We will give you the houses but that will happen in the next two years. Please do not expect us to deliver on this promise immediately after being elected,” he added.

He concluded the speech by singing his song, ‘Rinkiya ke papa’ and immediately went on to play cricket with the kids there. Seeing the bad state of the willow the kids were playing with, he asked his team to gift two bats to the children there.

Sales of pork has not reduced,” he added.Other two popular Chinese restaurants, Kowloon and Ninhao, report the same status. “Nobody doubts the way we cook our meat or hygiene.

The vehicle would be operated on the pilgrimage route 24 hours of the day, with public announcement systems informing the pilgrims of the safety measures.

People would be asked to walk on the pavements, take note of the vehicles coming in the opposite direction, take care in the curves, avoid walking with headphones, take care of elders, differently abled people, children and women.

Tired of making repeated representations to the highway authorities and district administration and staging demonstrations to mend the badly damaged Nagercoil to Thiruvananthapuram national highway (NH), Kanyakumari MP H Vasanthakumar has sought the help of Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla.

The MP raised the issue on Wednesday pertaining to stating that the highway was not repaired for two years, despite funds to the tune of Rs 49 crore sanctioned for that purpose. He accused the highways department officials of remaining mute spectators to repeated representations.

Vasanthakumar said the contractor neither got the job done nor responded positively whenever he approached him over the issue. Pressing on the urgency of the matter, he said that people of his constituency are calling him incapable of getting such a small task done.

So, he appealed to the Speaker to instruct the highways ministry to rectify the road.

336,['6/02/2020'],Goa: Crores in unpaid bills exposes government’s empty coffers,"This story is from February 6, 2020

Several bills pertain to the South Goa district hospital

PROVORIM: In the assembly, chief minister Pramod Sawant may insist that the state’s finances are intact, but the state’s unpaid bills tell a different story. Goa State Infrastructure Development Corporation, of which Sawant is chairman, owes Rs 91.7 crore to contractors for 177 contracts, data released by the state government shows.

The unpaid bills are for a variety of contracts, from construction to purchase of medical equipment.

GFP president Vijai Sardesai sought information on all outstanding payments to contractors in a legislative assembly question, based on which the data was provided.

Sardesai claimed that contractors' bills to the tune of Rs 767 crore were not paid, as the government lacked funds to clear the pending dues.

Several bills pertain to the South Goa district hospital, which remains incomplete till date.

Sawant also admitted in a written reply that aside from the state’s outstanding loans, government corporations and autonomous bodies such as GSIDC, Kadamba Transport Corporation, Goa Tourism Development Corporation, Imagine Panaji Smart City Development Ltd., Sewerage Corporation, Goa Waste Management Corporation, Sanjivani Sakhar Karkhana and Goa Industrial Development Corporation have loans amounting to Rs 359.6 crore as on March 31, 2019. In the current financial year, these agencies have borrowed an additional Rs 158.7 crore, Sawant informed the House.

The state government’s liabilities stand at Rs 20,411.6 crore and in 2019-20, Goa has borrowed Rs 2,081 crore out of the Rs 2,691 crore limit prescribed by the Union ministry of finance. Most of these funds, the government said, were spent on infrastructure projects in the state.

“The government has never defaulted in repayment of debt. The state is maintaining a Consolidated Sinking Fund and Guarantee Redemption Fund with the Reserve Bank of India as a buffer for repayment,” said Sawant.

337,['6/02/2020'],Central Vista: Veil of secrecy in DDA hearing on land use,"This story is from February 6, 2020

NEW DELHI: A public hearing on the change of land use of seven plots in the capital’s Central Vista , which will pave the way for a new Parliament House and many government offices to come up, was held behind closed doors at Delhi Development Authority’s (DDA) headquarters at Vikas Sadan on Thursday. The media was not allowed to cover the proceedings and a few respondents said that they were also barred from recording the hearing process on their mobile phones.

In December, the authority had changed the land use of seven plots spread over 100 acres, including that of a 15-acre plot on Dalhousie Road near South Block where a new Prime Minister’s residence has been proposed under the Central Vista redevelopment project. The approved change of land use of these plots was put in the public domain for suggestions and objections for 30 days and a two-day public hearing started on Thursday where those who had sent their suggestions or objections were allowed to speak.

“The change of land use is a precursor to all the changes envisaged, yet people were given very short notice for the public hearing. Why is the housing and urban affairs ministry not putting out the details of their plan in the public domain?” asked Narayan Moorthy, an architect, who was one of the respondents.

Senior DDA officials, however, said that they have followed all the procedures laid for the change of land use. The media is not allowed at public hearings so that “there is no ruckus,” said an official. “A notice for hearing is given one or two days in advance as per procedure,” the official added.

“The hearing happens before a board of inquiry, which is free to give its recommendations. After this, the changes will be put before the authority in a meeting chaired by the lieutenant governor of Delhi. The final decision is then taken and sent to the Centre for notification,” said the official.

“If the Prime Minister residence comes here, the boat club will become a high-security zone, and people will not be able to visit the area,” said SL Ganapathi, a businessman and another respondent.

Amritha Ballal, an architect, asked why are the documents regarding the redevelopment project not in the public domain. “This is erasure of history that must be contested,” said Iram Sultan, an interior designer.

Meenakshi Nath, another respondent, claimed that some of the proposed buildings would have four-level basements, which will hamper recharging of groundwater and flow of water to Yamuna.

“Our role is limited as we are only responsible for changing the land use. We have taken care that the change will not lead to Delhi’s green area shrinking,” a DDA official said. “Also, the total load on Delhi will not increase as offices are not coming from outside,” he added.

COIMBATORE: The oldest pump testing laboratory in the region, on the campus of the Branch MSME Development Institute at Ram Nagar here, is all set to get a makeover soon.

The ministry of MSME has sanctioned Rs 1.08 crore to renovate the laboratory infrastructure.

The facility was opened as an extension centre in 1959 along with an electric motor testing laboratory. In 1979, it was upgraded to a development institute, where pumps were tested. The lab is now accredited by the National Accreditation Board for Testing and Calibration Laboratories and recognised by the Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS).

The renovation work is in progress and Rs 2lakh for the initial work and Rs 85,000 for shifting cables was released, said branch head of the institute R Vijayakumar. “The work has been taken up by the central public works department (CPWD),” he said. The institute has two separate facilities one to test motors and another to test pumpsets, mainly agricultural pumpsets. “BIS collects random samples from manufacturers and give them to us for testing to find whether they comply with the norms and standards. We test them and provide the results to BIS,” Vijayakumar said.

The lab has a capacity to test up to 20HP pumps. It can test two samples per day.

Among others, the lab has equipment such as volumetric tank for tracking discharge, voltmeter and ammeter to test voltage and current the pumps work at and flowmeter. “We calibrate the equipment every year by taking them to the Fluid Control Research Institute at Kanjikode in Kerala . We have also submitted a proposal to modernise the labs,” the official said.

While the motor testing lab can test all kinds of motors, the pump testing lab can test agricultural pumps, submersible pumps and centrifugal pumps.

The city has another pump testing lab at the Scientific and Industrial Testing and Research Centre (SiTarc) at Avarampalayam .

Panaji: The number of driving licences issued to persons with disabilities doubled in 2019 compared to the previous year. A total of 50 driving licences were issued to members of the community last year, unlike 2018, wherein only 25 were issued.

This was revealed during the LAQs at the ongoing assembly session tabled by Curtorim MLA Aleixo Lourenco.

Figures also revealed, that of the 50 licences issued in 2019, three were issued to persons with hearing impairment. The same number of licenced (3) were issued to persons with hearing impairment in 2018, as opposed to 2017, when only one person was issued a driving licence.

The licensing authorities had received more applications from the community; however, 16 licences were rejected last year. Of these, 13 licences rejected were to persons with hearing impairment,data revealed.“Rejection of applications for driving licence is exclusively based on the recommendation of the medical board that the person with disability is found unfit to safely drive a motor vehicle,” transport minister Mauvin Godinho stated in his reply.

While the new Motor Vehicle (Amendment) Bill, 2019, which was passed by the Lok Sabha last year, is yet to be implemented in Goa, the amended rules further enable persons with disabilities to acquire a driver’s licence, in a move towards inclusion.

The rules enable the conversion of a motor vehicle into an adapted vehicle to be used by persons with disabilities, provided the modified vehicle meets safety and emission requirements.

Justice M Dhandapani, acquitting E Hariharane (since deceased) and G Veeraraghavan, who had both served as directors-general of police, fire services department, between May 1989 and July 1992, said: “The trial court totally got carried away by the figures portrayed than by the materials, in black and white, available before it to come to a reasonable and justifiable conclusion. Therefore, left with no alternative, this court is inclined to set aside the conviction and sentence recorded by the trial court as being devoid of any merit.”

The prosecution had alleged that the two officers had incurred a pecuniary loss of Rs 1.77 crore and Rs 31.56 lakh to the exchequer in the purchase of pumps, construction of emergency rescue tender and purchase of high capacity portable pumps. It said the officers floated and finalised tenders and awarded the contract in breach of not only the tender conditions, but also giving a go-by to specifications, thereby facilitating pecuniary advantage to the supplier. It said the conspiracy was hatched by the officers between May 1989 and July 1992.

HYDERABAD: A day after the Centre made it clear that Nizamabad would get a regional centre of Spices Board, TRS charged BJP and Nizamabad MP Dharmapuri Arvind with making false promises to people of the constituency.

Armoor MLA and chairman of the public undertakings committee of the assembly A Jeevan Reddy alleged that Arvind had promised to get a turmeric board for Nizamabad within five days after he won as MP in 2019. Jeevan added regional centres of Spices Board were already functioning in Warangal and Guntur and had not served any purpose to farmers. “It looks like farmers asked for biryani and Centre served them stale food,” he said. Jeevan said the demand for turmeric board in Nizamabad was pending since 1986.

AURANGABAD: The much-awaited railway Pink Book that came out on Wednesday — four days after the Union Budget — has generated angry reactions from the passenger community in Marathwada as the region has once again been ignored.

Even if the South Central Railway (SCR) has been sanctioned Rs 6,846 crore towards infrastructure development for the year 2020-21, Aurangabad and Marathwada as a whole have nothing much to cheer owing to meagre budgetary allocations.

Barring Rs 75 crore allocation for Mudkhed-Parbhani doubling project along with Rs 50 crore and Rs 20 crore for electrification of Manmad-Mudkhed-Dhone and Pipalkutti-Mudhked sections and Parbhani-Parli Vaijnath section respectively, the budget has no major announcements for Marathwada.

Provision of Rs 100 crore for installing the Traffic Collision Avoidance System (TCAS) between Manmad-Nanded-Secunderabad-Dhone-Guntakal and Bidar-Parli-Parbhani sections is among the very few bright spots for the region.

Railway activist Raj Somani said the railway Pink Book — containing all the details about the infrastructure works, demands for grants and comprehensive details of budgetary allocations for carrying out various works in Railways — has disappointed the passenger community in Marathwada.

“After sustained follow up with railway authorities for pursuing different connectivity and infrastructural demands, we had hopes for some major announcements. However, the policy makers have once again neglected Marathwada,” he said.

Another railway activist said they were hopeful of receiving budgetary provision for laying down the new line from Rotegaon to Kopargaon, and construction of pit-line in Aurangabad.

“A new rail line on the 22-kilometer route between Rotegaon and Kopargaon has been one of the most sought after new routes in the region for the past few years. The route had received official sanction in 2017-18, but no work has taken place due to lack of money. The route will curtail travel time to Shirdi via Aurangabad considerably and ease traffic on busy Manmad junction,” veteran railway activist Omprakash Varma said.

While former SCR divisional railway manager (Nanded division) A K Sinha had formally announced in March 2017 that the pit-line would be set up at Chikalthana, nothing has been done towards it yet.

The rail budget has allocated Rs 11 crore for development of Tiruchanur railway station in Andhra Pradesh, but there is no mention of financial boost to development of Aurangabad railway station.

When contacted, a senior SCR official said some of the key pending demands of Marathwada would be fulfilled soon. “There is no question of giving preferential treatment to any region. Our zone comprises six divisions and we are committed to serve each zone in an effective manner. The zone as a whole has some demands in the pipeline and the same would be addressed soon,” he said

347,['6/02/2020'],National Deworming Day on February 10,"This story is from February 6, 2020

MANGALURU: The department of health and family welfare , Dakshina Kannada, is gearing up for the second phase of National Deworming Day that will be observed across India on Monday.

Children in the age group of 1 to 19 will be administered Albendazole as part of the nationwide campaign. While children in the age-group of 1-2 will be given half of the 400mg Albendazole tablet, those in the age-group of 2-19 will be given a full tablet.

Ramakrishna Rao, district health and family welfare officer, told reporters that the campaign into its sixth year, strives to address health issues such as malnutrition that worm infestation causes in children, who generally are vulnerable to it. Malnutrition results in stunted growth and has long-term effects on the growth and development of any child, he said, adding administering the tablet on a campaign mode will address this basic health issue.

All stakeholders including anganwadi and school teachers, ASHA workers and department staff have been trained to successfully carry out the campaign, he said. “Apprehensions of parents in the campaign having possible side-effects on health of their children is misplaced and the tablet is absolutely safe,” he said, adding even if the tablet is administered for the second time in close proximity, there will be no health implications for the children.

Dr Rajesh B V, reproductive and child health officer, said the district had received around 6 lakh Albendazole tablets for distribution among 5,29,160 beneficiaries in the above target age group. “We have distributed the tablets to schools and colleges, and teachers there, with help from department staff, will administer it,” said Dr Rajesh. Teams have been set up at taluk levels to address any unforeseen yet unlikely complications as part of the drive, he said.

The district health authorities have sought information from their counterparts in neighbouring Kasaragod about the people who were in contact with the people that tested positive for coronavirus, he said. There are no health issues with students from Kasaragod coming to Dakshina Kannada for education or other purposes, as the coronavirus-affected patients there have been kept in quarantine and are being treated there, said Dr Ramakrishna Rao.

Representative image

MADURAI: Taking a serious view on those who make hoax bomb threat phone calls to police units and sending threatening letters, the Tamil Nadu police department has decided to crack the whip against the trouble mongers. Often, trouble mongers go unpunished as police take a lenient view on them considering their positions. Most of the trouble mongers make such calls when they are stressed out, under influence of alcohol or just for fun. In some incidents, even school children make such calls to get a holiday from school, fearing examinations.

Police sources said that on an average two to four such hoax calls/letters are received in a year by the Madurai city police alone. Every time such hoax calls land in the police control room or 108 call centre, the police unit concerned comes to its toes in search of bombs. Police never take such incidents lightly and comb the entire premises to which the threat was received with utmost care

In a communication from the superintendent’s office of Q branch CID, Chennai dated February 4, sent to all police commissioners, superintendents of police and deputy commissioners they have been asked to prepare and send data on such incidents in the past. Details such as number of calls/letters, action taken against them, details of the trouble mongers with address, gist of the case and copy of audio/letter have been sought. The data for the past 20 years, till January 31 has been asked to be sent before the end of February.

“It is to inform that in the recent past the number of letters and hoax calls increased manifold. Every time a hoax calls is made the police officers are ill-equipped in conducting inquiry due to lack of information available on the past incidents. In order to ensure that swift and prompt investigation, it is necessary to maintain data of past incidents and trouble mongers” the letter read. A police officer from Madurai said that this is the first time such data is being collected and it is an indication of series of action awaiting trouble mongers. In some incidents, the trouble mongers have not been traced, whereas in many incidents they have been left off with severe warnings.

The reason behind the murder is still unknown, but sources said that family disputes might have led Jayant to ... Read More

NAGPUR: The semi-decomposed bodies of a 55-year-old woman and her maternal uncle were found in their flat on the first floor of an apartment on Wednesday in Dattatray Nagar. The bodies were lying in a pool of blood with stab marks on the bodies and ligature marks on the necks.

The deceased have been identified as Manjusha Natekar, 55, and her maternal uncle Ashok Kate, in his 70s. Sakkardara police have registered a case of murder and arrested Manjusha’s husband Jayant from Nagpur railway station within five hours of the incident coming to light.

The reason behind the murder is still unknown, but sources said that family disputes might have led Jayant to kill the duo.

Family members of the deceased told TOI that Manjusha, headmistress at a primary school in Subhedar Layout, used to live with her husband and maternal uncle in the flat. Kate, who was unmarried, had shifted to live with Manjusha after his sister died around one-and-a-half years ago.

Manjusha and Jayant regularly used to get into fights over family issues. On Monday too the couple had got into a fight.

A neighbour told TOI she heard Manjusha screaming for help several times on Monday morning at around 11. “We went to see what was happening but Jayant sent us away, saying it was their household matter. So we went away. They had also kept the TV on, so that no screams could be heard outside. At around 2.30pm on Monday, Jayant locked the door and went away on his two-wheeler. After that we did not heard anything from the house till Wednesday,” the neighbour said.

Sources from the police claimed that Jayant initially strangled Manjusha in the bedroom before stabbing her, and then strangled Kate before stabbing him too.

Since Manjusha did not go to school for two days, the school officials tried calling her. When they did not get any response, they called Manjusha’s brother Rajesh and informed him about her absence.

Rajesh went to Manjusha’s house and found the door locked. He opened the door with a spare key, and found Kate and Manjusha dead, and a stink spreading in the house. He raised an alarm and summoned the neighbours. One of the neighbours informed Sakkardara police. The crime branch cops too reached the spot.

Commissioner of police BK Upadhyay, Additional CP Shashikant Mahavarkar, DCP Chinmay Pandit, and DCP (crime) Gajanan Rajmane also visited the spot. Upadhyay directed cops to nab Jayant as soon as possible and also appointed five teams.

Cops conducted the spot panchanama and sent the bodies to Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH), where the post mortem will be conducted on Thursday.

Cops later nabbed Jayant from the railway station but were yet to officially place him under arrest.

352,['6/02/2020'],Kerala: Two held with 15kg of gold in Kasaragod,"This story is from February 6, 2020

Customs officials retrieved gold chains and bars hidden in the vehicle’s secret chambers.

KANNUR: Two men were arrested with 15.525 kg of gold worth Rs 6.2 crore in their possession at Bekal in Kasaragod on Wednesday .

Both the men were from Sangli, Maharashtra, customs commissioner Sumit Kumar said, adding that their identities would be revealed later.

The seizure, by the Kasaragod customs preventive unit, was the biggest in Kannur division after 1988, when 1,600 gold biscuits were seized at Irrikur in Kannur, according to customs assistant commissioner E Vikas.

“The accused have said that the gold was smuggled into India in paste and powder form. We suspect the involvement of Kasaragod-based smuggling mafia in the incident,” Kumar said.

The accused, aged 30 and 26, were travelling in a Maharashtra-registered SUV, and the customs officials had been shadowing it from Thalassery , based on a tipoff.

When the SUV crossed Kanhangad and stopped at a toll plaza at Bekal, the officials intercepted the car, and found the golden chains and bars hidden in the vehicle’s secret chambers.

The accused, arrested under the Customs Act, 1962, reportedly told the officials that they were carrying the gold to Mumbai. The suspected carriers would be produced before the chief economic court in Kochi .

353,['6/02/2020'],Governor gives go-ahead for probe against Ebrahim Kunju,"This story is from February 6, 2020

Thiruvananthapuram: Governor Arif Mohammed Khan has given sanction to investigate into the allegations of corruption against former PWD minister V K Ebrahim Kunju in the Palarivattom flyover scam . The decision will help end vigilance’s three-month wait to probe the role of former PWD minister in the scam.

The vigilance had in October last year sought the clearance of the state government to carry out an investigation into Ebrahim Kunju’s role in the flyover scam. Following this, the state government sought the governor’s permission and handed over the vigilance letter to the Raj Bhavan.

“As per new regulation from the Supreme Court, the sanction of a governor is required to carry out an investigation against former ministers. The prosecution permission is given only after the investigation is complete and the FIR is registered,” the governor’s office said.

The governor had sought legal opinion from the advocate general before taking a decision. Now the vigilance can go ahead with the investigation against Ebrahim Kunju. Kerala high court had earlier given permission to vigilance to probe into the former minister’s role in the alleged irregularities in the construction.

Ebrahim Kunju was under the scanner for allotting funds to the bridge builder way above the permissible limit. The vigilance wanted the former minister’s role probed as he had issued the order to give advance funds for the construction. The vigilance is also of the view that Ebrahim Kunju could not shy away from the responsibility in the alleged conspiracy. Former PWD secretary T O Sooraj, who was arrested for his involvement in the scam, had also raised allegations against the former minister.

The vigilance report said an amount of Rs 8.25 crore was paid as advance to the company at a meagre interest of 7%. This resulted in a yearly loss of Rs 57 lakh to the state government.

The flyover was opened to public in 2016. However, after cracks were detected on the pillars, various agencies had pointed out the inadequacies in the construction and it was closed for traffic in May 2019. A probe was subsequently launched to look into the likely irregularities that led to the faulty construction.

The probe was also extended to examine the role of certain political leaders in the scam. T O Sooraj, Sumit Goel, managing director of RDS Projects Ltd which constructed the flyover, and M T Thankachan, former additional general manager of RBDCK, were arrested earlier in connection with the scam and granted bail with strict conditions last year.

Policemen stand guard outside a branch of PMC Bank in Mumbai (File Photo)

MUMBAI: The city economic offences wing (EOW) on Wednesday filed a 12,000-page supplementary chargesheet in the Rs 6,700 crore Punjab and Maharashtra Cooperative (PMC) Bank loan fraud case against former BJP MLA Sardar Tara Singh’s son, Rajneet Singh, and six others. In December, police had filed a 32,000-page chargesheet against five accused in this case.

HDIL group directors Rakesh Wadhawan and son Sarang are accused of fraudulently availing more than Rs 6,700 crore loans from the bank and defaulting on repayment. Both were allegedly assisted by the bank’s former chairman Waryam Singh, managing director Joy Thomas and director Surjit Singh Arora. All five accused were earlier chargesheeted.

“We have filed the supplementary chargesheet before the court and are continuing our probe,” said Rajvardhan Sinha, EOW chief.

Those chargesheeted on Wednesday include four bank directors—Singh, Trupti Bane, Mukti Bavisi and Jagdish Mookhey—and three auditors—Ketan Lakdawala, Jayesh Sanghani and Anita Kirdat.

All 12 accused are in jail. “It is revealed that one of the major drawbacks in the functioning is inadequate due deligence on part of the concurrent and statutory auditors of the bank. The auditors have not performed the task of auditing the financials of the bank during 2008 and 2019 actively in tune with RBI, ICAI and other guidelines in this regard. It has transpired that the auditors have deliberately overlooked the huge advances portfolio and liabilities of the HDIL group companies in the bank and have not followed it up with either officials or board of directors,” read the chargesheet. It further stated for the past seven years, the concurrent audit of the bank’s Sion branch, where maximum loan accounts of HDIL group companies were being held, was with Kirdat.

Police sources said the accused hatched a criminal conspiracy to conceal the material position of long-pending dues of loan facilities to HDIL and to create a favourable environment within the bank for its group companies. The accused misappropriated bank funds for their personal gain (acquisition of properties in the country and abroad), causing wrongful losses to the bank, sources added.

The auditors are also accused of being hand in glove with Singh, Thomas and the Wadhawans to hide the 41 loan accounts where funds were diverted. Police will record statements of four witnesses before a magistrate so that they could be used as evidence during trial.

While Bane is a gynaecologist, Bavisi is a chartered accountant and Mookhey (72) is a tax consultant. “No diversion of funds to the accused directors’ accounts or siphoning of funds by them has been found yet,” said an EOW police officer. The forensic audit was done by Grant Thornton and a special investigation team is carrying out the probe. The state has appointed Ajay Misar as special public prosecutor. Mookhey was a member of the bank’s audit committee since 2005 and Bane a member of the recovery and loan advances committee. Singh was director in the recovery committee. One of the witnesses, a bank official who acted as whistleblower, had threatened to commit suicide if Thomas and others did not inform Reserve Bank of India about the hidden accounts.

Senthil Balaji

CHENNAI: In a setback to former transport minister Senthil Balaji , the Madras high court on Wednesday refused any relief against a warrant issued by a magistrate for central crime branch (CCB) to search his residence.

Justice P D Audikesavalu, refusing to entertain an urgent mention made by the ex-minister’s counsel, said such relief could not be sought in an anticipatory bail application. “If you are aggrieved by the warrant issued by the magistrate, you have to challenge the order through a separate petition. Such relief cannot be ordered in a bail application,” the judge said.

The issue pertains to a complaint lodged against the former minister with the CCB alleging that when he was transport minister he duped people of Rs 2.31 crore along with his associates promising jobs in the state transport corporation. In connection with the complaint, CCB conducted raids at the residence and other premises of Balaji. Therefore, apprehending arrest, Balaji moved the anticipatory bail application. Admitting the application and as an interim relief, Justice Audikesavalu orally instructed the CCB not to harass Balaji.

On Wednesday, when the court commenced proceedings post lunch, advocate A Saravanan made a mention before Justice Audikesavalu saying police are taking coercive steps by affixing search notice in his residence, directing him to appear before the investigating officer on February 6 and to open the lock of his Chennai residence. Even after the high court ordered authorities not to take any coercive steps against the DMK MLA, police are not obeying the direction, he complained. Public prosecutor A Natarajan, however, submitted that CCB had obtained appropriate order from the jurisdictional magistrate to conduct the search.

Nitin Gurjar (L) and Arun Sharma at the hospital on Wednesday

JAIPUR: With government-run ambulances on strike, two youths and a autorickshaw driver turned out to be life saviours for an elderly woman who was bleeding and unconscious at MD Circle on MD Road .

Twenty-six-year-old Arun Sharma and 21-year-old Nitin Gurjar , who were on their way to distribute Sharma’s wedding cards, spotted a woman lying unconscious with injuries.

“When we were passing through MD Circle, a vehicle hit an elderly woman and fled. She was bleeding profusely. There was no one helping her. We tried calling 108 ambulance service repeatedly, but we did not get the response. We thought that the woman would have died, if she did not get treatment on time. We decided to rush her to the hospital on our own,” said Gurjar, a self-employed youth.

Since the 108 ambulance service employees (drivers and nursing staff) were on strike due to non-payment of their salaries, the duo stopped an autorickshaw and rushed the unknown elderly woman to Institute of Traumatology and Orthopaedics of Sawai Man Singh Hospital.

“I am getting married on February 18 and it was important for us to distribute the invitation cards. But it was even more important for us to help the unknown elderly woman, lying on the road and needing immediate treatment,” said Sharma, a jeweller from Vaishali Nagar area.

He said that there were a lot of people surrounding the elderly woman but nobody was ready to help her.

Even the autorickshaw driver did not charge any money for transporting the elderly woman.

The two youths admitted the unknown woman to the hospital and made sure that her treatment started, before leaving from the hospital.

TimesView Thousands of citizens will benefit if these projects can gather a little more pace. Together, all the Metro corridors have the potential to change commute as we know it in Kolkata. All government agencies must work together to take advantage of the release of funds and speed up work.

KOLKATA: Metro Railway expects a hike in passenger volume by nearly 50,000 after the north-south network is thrown open till Dakshineswar in July this year. That is the time when Metro plans to resume 300 services. The number of services was reduced in December 2018 after Metro realised that it didn’t have adequate rakes.Metro Railway general manager Manoj Joshi told TOI that sufficient rakes will be available by July to run all the services.“The Medha rakes from ICF, Chennai, are arriving as scheduled. All issues with these rakes have been resolved. Performance trials of the Dalian rakes are also in progress and should be completed by March. An entire team of technicians from China is camping in Kolkata to study the results of the trials and take necessary measures. We shall have adequate number of rakes by the time the Dakshineswar link is commissioned,” Joshi said.The run time between Noapara and Dakshineswar will be about eight minutes and officials have calculated that 24 rakes would be required if every second service is to go up to Dakshineswar. Two rakes will be kept on standby. Necessary work is also on at the Noapara yard to allow easier movement of rakes to Dakshineswar. This is necessary as rakes can’t be parked at Dakshineswar.“We aim to complete work of the Dakshineswar stretch by June. I have asked additional teams of Rail Vikas Nigam Ltd (RVNL) officials to oversee the progress of work along that stretch. We realise the problems being faced by people of that area due to the closure of the Tallah Bridge. The Metro link will be a boon for many people who now have to spend a lot of additional time in commuting. Office goers and students will be the most benefitted as they have to reach their destinations on time,” Joshi added.After taking over, Joshi had also inspected work at the 32-km New Garia-Airport (via Rajarhat) stretch. According to him, the stretch is tricky due to the large number of canals where pillars have to be constructed.“We are continuously discussing issues with all agencies concerned. We have plans to start truncated services for the nearly 5km stretch between New Garia and Hemanta Mukherjee (Ruby) stations. However, there are three discontinuities in this stretch as well. There is a canal that needs to be spanned. Some land also needs to be acquired. RVNL engineers are working on that stretch to sort out issues,” the Metro GM said. Joshi will also be visiting the Joka-BBD Bag stretch soon and review the progress.",kolkata,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73976541,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-613376,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/dakshineswar-metro-line-to-hike-rider-count-by-50k/articleshow/73969424.cms

Nagpur: Happy Streets, organized by The Times of India and Maharashtra Times in association with the Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC), was chosen by Ready 2 Innovate WorldWide (R2iW) in the Popular Citizens Engagement Initiative category. In its first edition, awards were given in ten categories (details on page 4).

Mayor Sandip Joshi and Karlsruhe (Germany) mayor Frank Mentrup presented the award at a programme held at an auditorium in Civil Lines on Wednesday.

R2iW, an NGO-cum-private limited firm, constituted the award as part of its constant efforts to showcase and promote disruptive innovations towards enhancing the quality of life in cities.

Happy Streets was held on four Sundays — from December 22, 2019 to January 12, 2020 — on West High Court Road between Law College Square and Laxmi Bhuvan Square. Over 20,000 people turned up in the event which facilitated various fitness, recreational and non-motorized transport activities.

Ajay Gondane, ex-India High Commission to Australia, and R2iW team — deputy controller and head Pankaj Borkar, co-founders Yogita Kasture and Dyaneshwar Kamble — were present on the dais.

R2iW has taken up the initiative in collaboration with NMC, Smart City SPV NSSCDCL, Neeri, Nagpur First, IEEE Nagpur, VED Council and others. Innovations from industry and academia were showcased during the event.

Reminding sister-city collaboration with NMC two years ago, Mentrup hoped for new initiatives between Karlsruhe and Nagpur. He stressed the need for citizen participation in the growth of any city.

Stating suggestions and ideas for more development of city are always welcome, Joshi said, “Smartness is a human characteristic and technology can increase efficiency. Citizen’s participation is a must for accommodating growth in cities and for cost optimization.”

366,['6/02/2020'],Nirma wins salty trademark suit,"This story is from February 6, 2020

Ahmedabad: Nirma Ltd won a trademark case against a Rajasthan-based salt company and a local court restrained the latter from selling its products under the brand ‘Neema Sudh Iodised Salt’ and under a label with mark similar to it.

A city civil court restrained Pawan Salt Suppliers last week based on a 16-year-old suit filed by Nirma Chemical Works Ltd and Nirma Ltd. They claimed that they have been marketing various consumer products and iodized salt under the trademarks Nirma and Nima for many decades and have acquired a reputation and goodwill for their products across India.

Pawan Salt is a partnership firm from Nawa City in Nagaur district in Rajasthan. It is engaged in marketing of iodized salt. Nirma learned that Pawan Salt was selling its product under the name of ‘Neema Shudh Iodized Salt’. Nirma’s representatives approached Pawan Salt in 2004 and were promised by the Rajasthan company that it would not use the name for its product. One of the partners of Pawan Salt also wrote a letter to Nirma with this assurance.

However, Pawan Salt continued to sell its product under the same name. This brought Nirma to court, alleging infringement of its trademark rights. It complained that Neema Shudh is written in the style Nirma uses Nirma Shudh for its iodized salt and this caused confusion and deception in the market.

Nirma contended that it got the trademark and label registered in Class 30 in 1969 and its registration for salt products is still subsisting, valid and in force. Any deceptive name and label by Pawan Salt amounts to infringement on its intellectual property rights and thus the Rajasthan company was earning money illegally by passing off its product.

After hearing the case, judge S H Patel ordered Pawan Salt not to sell its salt under the name of Neema Shudh Iodized Salt.

Porvorim: Panchayat minister Mauvin Godinho told the Goa legislative assembly on Wednesday that the government wants to increase funds allotted for construction of panchayat ghars from Rs 2.5 crore to Rs 3.5 crore. However, financial assistance would not be extended to build more than one panchayat ghar in each constituency, he added.

Admitting that there have been some financial “problems”, Godinho said “out of the box ideas” will have to be implemented to address the problem, while replying to the question tabled by St Cruz MLA Antonio Fernandes. He said he will be meeting the central minister for panchayat Raj to seek more funds for the state.

Fernandes said the panchayat structures in his constituency were in bad condition, and they need to be rebuilt. He sought to know if the panchayat minister would offer help.“All three panchayat buildings are in bad shape,” said Fernandes.

Godinho said his ministry will only be able to sanction funds for one panchayat ghar in a constituency. Till date, he said 50 new panchayat ghars have been built across the state with government funds. A provision has been made for their maintenance, he added.

There is a bigger scope for RUCO scheme in Madurai as more number of FBOs would be brought under the fold soon... Read More

MADURAI: Food safety officials from Madurai have collected around 13,000 litres of used oil from eateries, bakeries and hotels under the Repurpose Used Cooking Oil (RUCO), an initiative of Food Safety and Standards Authorities of India (FSSAI), to prevent used oil from getting into the system again, as they can cause health risk to consumers.

Although the initiative was inaugurated in October, 2019, collection picked up only around a month ago. In the first phase, around 250 food business operators (FBOs) - big hotels, snacks factories and bakeries - were targeted. Many of them purchase more than 50 litres of oil. Officials said that oil can be used only for three times for frying as the total polar compound gets more than maximum prescribed limit of 25%. Using of oil beyond it would increase the risk of various health problems like hypertension, liver diseases and even cancer.

Designated officer for food safety Dr S Somasundaram said that Madurai is a frontrunner when it comes to implementation of RUCO scheme. Around 13 tonne of used oil has already been collected in just a month’s time.

FBOs have been distributed with containers as per their requirement and the oil is collected at regular intervals. Soon, the collected oil will be sent to the designated place, where it will be converted into biodiesel.

There is a bigger scope for RUCO scheme in Madurai as more number of FBOs would be brought under the fold soon. Once expanded, monthly collection could go up manifold.

Officials said that FBOs too are equally enthusiastic in the implementation of the scheme as they are paid Rs 25 per litre, the same amount they could get if they sold it outside. Stickers are pasted on the premises’ of the FBOs stating that oil used there is changed periodically. It helps to assure customers on the safety of food they consume, officials said.

Officials said that by removing used oil from the system helps environment too, as one litre of used oil can pollute thousands of litres of water.

Mostly, waste oil is being dumped into drains, which reaches nearby water bodies, resulting in pollution.

New Delhi: A man was killed while three others were injured when a cluster bus rammed their XUV500 near Kashmere Gate on Wednesday night. Police said that the impact of the accident was such that the car toppled on one side. All the four men were taken to a nearby hospital where one of them was declared brought dead. The bus driver was arrested later.

It was reported that the four men — Mangal, Sanjeev, Nand Lal and Mahender Sahu — were on their way back home towards Rohini. When they reached Kashmere Gate ISBT, the cluster bus coming from Tis Hazari rammed the SUV from the left side. A case was registered based on Sahu’s statement, who told police that the SUV was being driven by Mangal and he was sitting next to him. “The bus driver, after hitting the SUV, came close to the vehicle and saw the damage. He then fled towards Mori Gate. I managed to note down the number of the bus. Meanwhile, Mangal, along with help from locals, managed to catch hold of the driver and informed police,” said Sahu.

Locals said the bus was moving at a high speed and the driver, Vinod, could not control the vehicle even after spotting the SUV. Police said that Sanjeev, sitting on the rear left side of the car, succumbed to the injuries on his head.

The commercial run of the first phase will start 18 months after the first trials took place in July, 2018.

KOLKATA: The last trials for commissioning the first phase of East-West Metro took place successfully on Wednesday. Eight days later, railway minister Piyush Goyal will unveil the 5km stretch between Sector V and Salt Lake Stadium .

The commercial run of the first phase will start 18 months after the first trials took place in July, 2018. Along with the trial runs, another mock exercise was held on Wednesday at the behest of Metro Railway general manager Manoj Joshi. This one was to ensure a flawless inauguration ceremony on February 13.

Joshi’s visit was meant to ensure that everything would be in place when the railways minister inaugurates Kolkata’s Line 2 next Thursday. Manas Sarkar, MD, Kolkata Metro Rail Corporation (KMRC), was also present at the trial run on Wednesday. While East-West Metro is being implemented by KMRC , Metro Railway, which runs the north-south line, will be in charge of operations.

On Wednesday, the GM reached Sector V station at 10.30am. Officials from both agencies were already there by then. The GM saw locations where the dais would be put up and the place where the dignitaries would be seated. The timetable trial had started half-an-hour ago. Even as Wednesday’s dummy run was only for two hours, it was very significant since the final timetable was assessed through it.

On an average, the East-West trains will take 13 minutes to cover the 5km distance, stopping for 20 seconds at each station. A rake will take another three minutes for the changeover. In all, there will be 37 services during weekdays, with trains running at 20-minute intervals. On Sundays, there will be 25 services. All these specifications were fed into the system as the timetable software was loaded into the operations control centre (OCC), which is the control room that will automatically run the trains from the Central Park depot.

The software has been prepared by Ansaldo, the company that has provided software integration between the trains, signalling system, tracks and platform screen doors. While the system absorbed the timetable during the two-hour trial, a dress rehearsal for Thursday’s function was happening at the behest of the Metro Railway GM. Along with officials of Metro and KMRC, Joshi took a ride from Sector V till City Centre. The railway minister will be taking the same ride after flagging off the first train around 5pm next Thursday. He would get off at City Centre, where he would address the media. The inauguration ceremony would be aired on giant screens outside the East-West Metro stations.

Ahmedabad: To collectively raise and represent issues plaguing hospitals and nursing homes, a group of doctors and nursing homes in Ahmedabad have jointly formed what is known as Ahmedabad Hospitals and Nursing Homes Association (AHNHA). One of the key issues highlighted by the association was about issues faced by these hospitals with insurance companies and third-party administrators (TPAs).

“The rates offered by insurance companies to member hospitals are too low, which make it unviable to offer quality services to patients. Moreover, the charges have not been revised from many years, which make sustaining operations a challenge,” said Dr Bharat Gadhvi, president of the association, while briefing the media, on Tuesday.

AHNHA members also mentioned that there is no standard criteria for empanelling hospitals. “The association is also opposed to the General Insurance Public Sector Association (GIPSA) Preferred Provider Network (PPN) packages and describes them as unrealistic. AHNA will also represent to the government for providing a single window for issuance of new licences as well as renewal of licences,” said one of the members.

JAIPUR: A resident doctor doing his PG in neurosurgery was found unconscious in a washroom of a ward of Sawai Man Singh (SMS) Hospital on Wednesday morning.

Injections of sedatives have also been found from the washroom. It was not the first time he was found unconscious. He has been saved twice within a month by hospital staff. However, the cause of his alleged attempt to end his life has not been ascertained yet. The incident happened around 9.30am when he went missing from the neurosurgery ward, where he was posted. After searching for him for more than an hour, he was found in a washroom of a neighbouring ward. The hospital staff rushed him to neurosurgery ICU and put him on ventilator support.

The doctors resuscitated him and his condition improved by the evening and he was taken off ventilator support, said hospital sources. The family of the doctor reached the hospital and looked worried. SMS Hospital medical superintendent Dr DS Meena said, “It is not for the first time he has been found in such a situation.

Earlier too, he was found unconscious. We are trying to find out the cause.” According to hospital sources, he was found unconscious on January 14 and at that time the doctors thought that he might have seizures. At that time too, he was admitted to ICU. In July 2019, a first-year postgraduate student of medicine had allegedly committed suicide in her hostel at Mahila Chikitshalya in the city. The 25-year-old from Punjab was specialising in gynaecology at the city’s Zanana Hospital.

Thrissur: Governor Arif Mohammed Khan, on Wednesday, has put the onus of deciding over Citizenship (Amendment) Act ( CAA ) on the Supreme Court .

Addressing the media in Thrissur, the governor said that he had earlier expressed his stand on CAA and he would never change it.

“The Supreme Court has sought a report from the Centre based on the state government’s petition against CAA. The court has not sought a report from me,” the governor said.

Hold onto the value of life and try to be innovative, was the governor’s message to students, after inaugurating the centenary celebrations of Thrissur Sacred Heart School on Wednesday. “Computer chips with artificial intelligence would soon be available in the market at cheap rates,” he said.

“Germany has already reduced the size of MRI scanning machines to just that of a suitcase. It will not take more than five years to reinvent it to that of a tablet’s size as technology is changing at a rapid rate,” Khan said.

“The future would be in the hands of a group of young people who come up with innovative ideas. However, ideas will keep changing,” he added.

The governor was all praise for Kerala’s education sector and said that it could serve as a model for the entire nation.

“As rural areas of the country lack proper educational facilities, it is the responsibility of each citizen to extend a helping hand for such less-privileged people,” the governor said.

Workers erecting the float on the Mariamman Teppakulam tank.

MADURAI: The float festival of the Sri Meenakshi Sundareswarar temple to be held on February 8, promises to be one of the best in recent years, as the tank is brimming with water and people are working round-the-clock to erect the float.

Thanks to the efforts of the corporation commissioner, S Visakan, joint commissioner of the temple, N Natarajan and the public works department (PWD), the Mariamman Teppakulam has received water from its traditional supply channels which used to bring water to it for over 400 years from the Vaigai river, after more than 40 years. The high court too had directed that steps be taken to fill the tank through its traditional channels. Previously, the temple used to pump water from the Vaigai riverbed to the tank through pipes, which resulted in sewage too being pumped when the water level was low.

However, this year, there was a copious flow in the river, and the construction of a check dam on the riverbed helped the tank receive water without any hindrance. At present, the tank is holding 14ft of water.

Workers from Kumbakonam are in the process of erecting the float this year. S Suresh, of Kumbakonam, who comes from a family of traditional temple decorators, and who has decorated the yagasala at the Thanjavur Big Temple for its consecration is also in charge of the float of the Meenakshi temple. The float will be of 32x32ft dimension and 32ft tall. “The deities Sri Meenakshi and Lord Sundareswarar will be put on a pedestal which will be 12ft tall, which will help people from many feet away to see the deities clearly this year,” said Suresh.

It will be pulled around the tank twice in the morning, and once in the evening. Joint commissioner of the temple, N Natarajan said that all precautions including rescue personnel from the fire service, NCC cadets would be deployed near the tank, for additional security this year. Life jackets are also being kept ready in the event of any emergency. The entire festival would be monitored with the help of drones.

383,['6/02/2020'],Delhi Elections 2020: Pehle AAP? Delhi’s Muslims look to pick side to cancel out BJP in polls,"NEW DELHI: In polarised times, three is a crowd. Fully aware of the perils of a triangular contest, the capital’s 25 lakh Muslims who want to hold back BJP know they have to choose between AAP and Congress “Sabka apna rujhan hota hai, but the wave seems to be for AAP,” says 70-year-old Mohammed Tehsin, a vendor from Mustafabad in northeast Delhi. He has voted for Congress his whole life, including in the last Lok Sabha election, but most of the neighbourhood is voting for AAP, he says. “It is difficult to choose in the voting booth, ungli dagmaaga jaati hai, but it is important to make a clear decision,” he says.Two boys on a bike speak up loudly for Congress, pointing out that the candidate’s father, Hasan Ahmed, had built these roads and the nearby graveyard, and had worked hard. But they also admit they would probably persuade their families to vote for AAP so that the community’s vote could be ektarfa. Last time, BJP had coasted to power with 58,388 votes in the constituency, which was split between Congress at 52,357 and AAP at 49,791.While Congress has leapt in to defend Muslims in the CAA-NRC resistance and police excesses, AAP has steered largely clear of the issue.Even at Batla House chowk near Jamia Millia Islamia, one of the epicentres of the recent violence, there is more vocal support for AAP. While Nasim Ahmed, a Congress supporter, claims that his candidate, Parvez Hashmi, “has never lost an election from here, and has done most of the work to build the area”, he is outnumbered by the others, who say that Congress has not put up a damdaar CM candidate this time. “In the 2015 elections, when AAP won, it was all decided in the last three days, paasa palat gaya. This time though, the leher is clearly with Arvind Kejriwal,” says Aas Mohammed. Many of these men used to work at a 30-year-old steel fabrication business that shut down, because of GST and rising costs.Voters are eloquent on the dangers of NRC and CAA, of Modi government’s economic record, its sale of PSUs, and so on. This, however, is an existential crisis, they say. “It is only the bhaichaara of old that now sustains us, the nai fasal does not seem to understand that,” despairs Aas Mohammed. But this struggle for the Constitution, it is larger than the Delhi elections, he says.Sitting on the steps of Jama Masjid at a protest against CAA-NRC, 34-year-old Nida (who doesn’t want to share her last name), says: “Matia Mahal will see a sweep for jhadoo — I say this with 98% confidence.”AAP candidate Shoaib Iqbal has just hopped over from Congress and commands great clout in the area, having won every election (except the last) under various party banners. “My father is a kattar Congressi, but even he understands, why waste a vote this time,” she says.In nearby Ballimaran, AAP MLA and minister Imran Hussain, a businessman who was an independent councillor before joining the party, is visibly popular. His office handles Aadhaar cards, ration cards, caste certificates and other paperwork, hospital referrals, and so on. “We have a daily footfall of 300-400 people here, and 10 staff members. Meanwhile, Congress candidate Haroon Yusuf (former minister and party heavyweight who had been elected five times from Ballimaran) does not even have an office in the neighbourhood,” claims AAP councillor Mohammed Sadiq.He is dismissive about BJP’s polarisation campaign. “Delhi is the heart of India. People from all over the country, of all religions and castes and backgrounds live here. These issues of dharm and jati don’t impact Delhi, what matters are real issues”. AAP volunteers claim to have constructed 100 borewells, and replaced 80% of the sewerage network in the area. There is a mohalla clinic close by, and three schools are being built. “The borewell work began with Haroon Yusuf, he has also worked. But with him, ek- zamana-tha wali baat ho gayi — I think he should have sat out this election,” says Mohammed Asif, who runs a spectacles shop in Ballimaran.He makes a clear distinction between the Lok Sabha election, where “bigger internal and international issues matter”, and this one, which is about service delivery, about gullies and sewers, water and electricity, schooling and health. AAP has worked hard on all fronts, he says. Fees have been waived for minority students who can produce an income certificate, says Nazma Bari, an ad hoc teacher in a municipal school in Matia Mahal.For many voters, it is not just a tactical choice between the Lok Sabha and Vidhan Sabha, there is a genuine satisfaction with AAP’s redistributive work. The slashing of electricity and water bills means more to the poor than abstract “development” work like flyover-construction that Sheila Dikshit used to talk up, they say. “I used to pay Rs 1,000-1,200 for electricity, Rs 2,500-3,000 sometimes for water. Now, it is nothing. I also got my GPS SIM free,” says Zamir Ahmed, an auto driver.Meanwhile, an e-rickshaw driver, Mohammed Salim says that his 80-year-old mother sends duas for Arvind Kejriwal. “He won my heart when he spoke about getting corrupt officials suspended.

385,['6/02/2020'],"Announced by FM in Budget, smart power meters unavailable in market","This story is from February 6, 2020

Nagpur: Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced in the Budget last week that all existing electricity meters will be replaced by smart ones within three years. However, MSEDCL’s experience shows that they are not available in the market.

MSEDCL had floated a tender for purchasing pre-paid smart meters worth Rs160 crore in the second half of 2017. So far it has not been able to purchase a single meter despite re-tendering several times.

A company spokesperson said, “We are unable to get offers for smart meters that meet our specifications. We will purchase meters only when they meet our specifications.”

The target for the discom was to replace 4 lakh meters in 10 cities where infrastructure augmentation works under Integrated Power Development Scheme (IPDS) had been carried out.

According to the MSEDCL tender, the meters should download the energy consumption data every 15 minutes. The meter will also have to record whether the meter has been tampered every 15 minutes. Bill history and load survey have to be uploaded every 45 days.

The data read by the smart meter should be available at MSEDCL data centre at any moment. For this purpose the supplier has to install his own data collection software at the data centre and integrate it with MSEDCL software. There are several other requirements, which are technical in nature.

The spokesperson said that the company was installing radio frequency (RF) meters in high loss areas. “The RF meters are also smart meters although not as advanced as the ones we want to purchase. Thousands of RF meters have been installed in high distribution loss areas especially those coming under Jalgaon, Latur and Nanded circles.”

He further said that large number of incidences of power theft had come to fore after installation of RF meters.

The Tariff Policy formulated under Electricity Act, 2003, in January 2016 envisaged replacement of all existing electricity meters by smart ones in high loss areas. The amended Policy formulated in 2018 envisaged replacing all existing meters by smart ones all across the country but priority is to be given to high loss areas. The FM has therefore announced a goal mentioned in the Tariff Policy.

386,['6/02/2020'],Combined transport authority to be revived in Chennai,"This story is from February 6, 2020

Aerial view of Chennai

CHENNAI: The state government has decided to dust off plans for an agency covering all modes of transport in the city. A year after notifying rules for the Chennai Unified Metropolitan Transport Authority ( Cumta ), steps are now being taken to give more teeth to the authority. The development comes in the wake of the World Bank stressing that the multi-department body be converted into a single window agency for infrastructure projects .

Officials in the housing and urban development department said the aim was to integrate multimodal transport. “The prime responsibility of Cumta is to design all infrastructure projects including metro rail alignment, flyovers and laying pipelines. Unfortunately, it operates only as a coordinating agency as independent departments continue to execute infrastructure projects (like in the past),” an official said. This has rendered the authority toothless, he added. A World Bank team that had met state government officials last year stressed that Cumta be a nodal agency for all infrastructure projects executed in the Chennai Metropolitan Area (CMA) which could then be financed by the funding agency. “They have reiterated it during their meeting in January this year that things should be in place by March. We wanted to transform Cumta into a statutory body where any work or project carried out on roads are executed through it and it serves larger sections, instead of showcasing a particular department’s project,” the official said. The revival includes design and funding for projects. “Anything done on the road from replacing signals to building flyovers and coming up with metro rail alignment would come under the purview of Cumta that would be strengthened with more powers,” an official privy to developments said.

As per the plans, the Cumta chairman, who is the transport minister according to the Act, will be replaced by the chief minister. While an IAS officer would be appointed as member secretary, the authority will be based at Chennai Metropolitan Development Authority (CMDA) office. Currently, a chief planner of CMDA holds charge as member secretary of Cumta. Transport department sources said amending the Act was under discussion.

Urban development experts said it was need of the hour because various departments were carrying out their own projects and the whole development process lacked larger vision. Former professor of urban engineering at Anna University K P Subramanian said a single agency would help implement infrastructure projects effectively. “Countries like Singapore are implementing it such a manner,” he said.

PORVORIM: Goa assembly speaker Rajesh Patnekar on Wednesday disallowed a calling attention motion on the death of Merces panch Prakash Naik. Patnekar said that since there was a court hearing in the matter on Wednesday, it may be prejudiced by the discussion in the House.

“There is a hearing in court today (Wednesday) and the hearing shouldn’t be prejudiced by the discussion in the House, so it is disallowed as of now,” he said.

Former deputy CM Ramkrishna Dhavalikar pressed for the calling attention to be taken up, stating that the issue in court was “quite different” from the subject of the calling attention motion. Patnekar, however, stood by his ruling.

The motion was called for by opposition leader Digambar Kamat along with GFP MLAs Vijai Sardesai, Jayesh Salgaonkar, Vinod Paliencar, independent MLA Rohan Khaunte, MGP’s Dhavalikar and Congress MLA Aleixo Reginaldo Lourenco.

Encroachments in Walled City have become a major problem

JAIPUR: Amidst elation over getting the World Heritage Title by UNESCO for the ‘Walled’ City, not much seems to have been done to conserve its iconic heritage wall.

As per the report of the Indian National Trust for Art and Culture Heritage ( INTACH ) in 2015, only 25% of the wall in the Walled City is remaining. Due to rampant encroachment in the Walled City, the iconic wall may not last long if not preserved by the authorities.

While proposing Jaipur to be tagged as World Heritage site, government had promised to remove encroachment from the wall. No such step has been taken in the last six months since the heritage tag was received, while people have built their houses adjacent to the wall.

Near Sikar house, there are parts of the broken wall from where people have constructed their houses. Near Chaughan stadium, a lane named Hathiyon ki Thant is built around the heritage wall. Elephants were kept in this lane before independence and the royal family used to visit Chaughan stadium to witness the elephant fight . It used to be a popular sport in those times.

Today, the wall is encroached as people have constructed houses adjoining to it. Rajnath Chauhan , a resident of the area said, “Our family was given title by the durbar. However, most of the people living around the wall do not have ownership and have constructed houses illegally. There are two Bhurj on top of the wall – Chini ki Bhurj and Moti Bhurj and you can find people living inside the wall where there is a room for stairs going towards the Bhurj. They have made adjustments as per their requirements and authorities have done little to change it.”

With the World Heritage tag, the government has now been asked to remove all the encroachment and restore the remaining wall by the end of this year. If the criteria are not fulfilled, Jaipur may lose the title.

Addressing a press conference here, Laxman said chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao had promised to provide Kumbh Mela-type facilities to the devotees. “KCR is not only deceiving people of the state, but he is also deceiving gods and goddesses by making false promises,” he alleged.

Laxman sought to know as to why the government did not make any serious attempts to get the Centre declare Medaram jatara as a national festival.

Welcoming the decision to form a trust for construction of a Ram temple in Ayodhya, he said KCR should welcome the announcement of Prime Minister Naredra Modi made in Parliament. “He (KCR) always claims himself as a real Hindu and organises yagams. He should make his stand clear on Modi’s announcement on construction of the temple,” he said.

JAIPUR: Rajasthan high court on Wednesday expressed its disappointment over inaction on the part of authorities in removing encroachments in Walled City areas. The court asked UDH secretary to be present in court on March 16 if it failed to act on it.

The division bench of Justice Sangeet Lodha and Justice Mahendra Goyal issued the order on a suo motu petition seeking the removal of encroachments.

Vimal Chaudhary who appeared for the petitioners informed the court that the JMC had so far only issued notice to encroachers, but no action was taken so far.

The corporation after a survey found that 19 properties require complete demolition and accordingly the court in its September 2019 order directed it to carry out the demolitions within three months.

The court had formed a committee under principal secretaries of UDH and law department.

But so far, the authorities had only served notices and no action taken. The UDH department on Wednesday sought four more weeks to act said, Yogesh Tailor, another counsel from the petitioner’s side.

In her FIR, the woman, who was married on March 3, 2018, stated that her husband and in-laws, residents of Fatehwadi, began seeking dowry a month after the wedding.

They had first asked for a scooter and when she denied, her husband and in-laws had beat her. “They used to taunt me for having short height and said I should have brought more dowry to make up for my height,” stated the woman in FIR.

“My husband, father-in-law and mother-in-law used to call me a mad woman and said I looked like a mad woman as I studied psychology.”

The woman said that she tolerated the harassment to save her marriage. “They beat me even when I was four months pregnant,” she stated in the FIR. In October 2019, the woman was again asked for more dowry, and then beaten and abandoned when she refused.

JAIPUR: Every single household in Walled City of Jaipur will go through social mapping as part of the Unesco heritage site task aiming to create the site sustainable and friendlier to its residents.

The mapping includes—type of houses, alleys, number of residents—age-wise, gender and occupation, income levels, institutions and types of vehicles. The central aim of the mammoth exercise is to ascertain that socio-economic impact of the heritage site on its residents. The completion of the mapping is among the six tasks which needs to be ended before the end of 2020.

“Every house in the Walled City will be taken into account for the survey. Minor details like how many members to number of vehicles they owned and from traffic situation to livelihood issues involving the residents will be collected. It aim is to achieve multi-fold objectives like improving the socio-economic conditions of the residents living in the heritage site and to make the site sustainable to preserve it for generations to come,” said Sikha Jain , a Cultural Heritage expert in UNESCO World Heritage Committee.

The walled city area is spread in 9 square kms. It has close to one lakh houses with a population of 6 lakh. The local administration has commissioned the mapping to several agencies including Unesco office in Delhi which will hold workshops by the experts. Further disclosing the details of the mapping, Jain noted that it will also help in determining the socio-economic needs of the residents including artisans and others living inside the area. “The data will help in preparing a special area plan which will act like a manual for the heritage site,"" said Jain.

The accused in police custody in Bhopal on Monday

BHOPAL: Doctors on Wednesday recommended sending Yogesh Tripathi — who breached the Raja Bhoj airport security and vandalized a chopper at the state hangar and blocked a plane — to Gwalior ’s mental hospital .

He will be sent to the mental hospital from Bhopal jail at night.

During the check-up of the 22-year-old, Hamidia hospital doctors found that he was suffering from acute psychosis. Psychosis is characterized by an impaired relationship with reality. It is a symptom of serious mental disorders. People who are experiencing psychosis may have either hallucinations or delusions. The person experiencing psychosis may also have thoughts that are contrary to actual evidence.

Realizing his situation, doctors recommended sending him to the mental hospital. After discharge from hospital, Tripathi was taken to Bhopal central jail, from where he will be sent to Gwalior mental hospital . Bhopal jail superintendent, Dinesh Nargawe, told TOI that formalities have been completed and Tripathi would be sent to Gwalior by midnight.

The youth was admitted to Hamidia hospital on Tuesday after his condition deteriorated in Gandhi Nagar police custody. Doctors kept him under observation for 24 hours to assess his mental condition. The accused had even turned violent when he was being taken to hospital and tore the uniform of a policeman and allegedly bit some other cops.

In a major security breach at Raja Bhoj airport on February 3, the 22-year-old college student — who allegedly wanted to play commando — sneaked into the state hangar, vandalized a parked helicopter and blocked a SpiceJet flight that was moving for takeoff.

After the incident, CISF personnel arrested Tripathi, who sports a crew cut and goatee and wore camouflage trousers. Yogesh told security personnel that he breached airport security because he “wanted to get into commando training”.

His family was bewildered by this claim and says he had never shown any inclination for military service. The accused entered the state hangar through the gate before committing the crime.

Thiruvananthapuram: Reiterating the government stand for a joint fight , including open demonstrations and agitations, by the LDF and UDF against the CAA (Citizenship Amendment Act), chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan has urged the IUML leaders to persuade the Congress into such a fight “as the secular credentials of the country were at stake”.

Hinting at the “unfortunate stand” taken by the KPCC leadership on such a joint agitation, the CM, while making his concluding remarks during the discussion on the motion of thanks to the governor’s address in the assembly on Wednesday, said the ruling and opposition parties should come together to spread the message among people.

“The IUML, however, seems to have taken a stand favourable for a joint fight. Now, they need to persuade the Congress leadership to shed their party politics and join the fight against CAA,” Vijayan said.

The CM also clarified that a joint electoral fight at the national level against the BJP was not possible now as the Congress had no alternative to the economic policies being implemented by the Modi-led government. “Such an opposition needs not just strength, but also alternative policies. Unless Congress rectifies its economic policies, it cannot be an alternative to the BJP,” he said.

Opposition leader Ramesh Chennithala later told reporters that Vijayan was playing a political game in the name of fighting CAA. “The UDF is not for making any political gains, and will strengthen its fight against the CAA,” he said.

Taking part in the discussions, Chennithala said the LDF government was giving mere promises in the name of Rebuild Kerala Initiative (RKI). “The CM made 13 foreign trips during his tenure and none of it was beneficial for the state,” he pointed out.

The motion of thanks to the governor’s address was later passed by the assembly.

Choti Chaupar's shape has been changed by the Jaipur Metro Rail Corporation

JAIPUR: The shape of iconic 18th century Choti Chaupar , a public square built over an underground water tank, has been changed to a circle by the Jaipur Metro Rail Corporation (JMRC) in violation of the state government’s commitment to the Unesco.

The Walled City was listed in the Unesco site in 2019 with the commitment to preserve its cultural and architectural heritage. The blatant change of its shape from a square to a circle in the presence of Heritage Technical Committee questions the seriousness of the state in sticking to its commitments.

Expressing concern over tampering of the Chaupar, Shikha Jain , a cultural heritage expert in Unesco World Heritage Committee who prepared the dossier for the heritage site said, “I am disheartened to see the change in the independent structure (Chaupar), which doesn’t go well with the commitments made to Unesco. I came to know about the change last week and informed the authorities to take note of it. I hope the shape will be restored it at the earliest,” said Jain.

The tampering with the historical site has been made to give way to the entry gate and lifts for the newly built underground metro station as well as to create more space to de-congest traffic at peak hours.

Besides the Chaupar, several other heritage sites in the Walled City have been tempered with. In the last six months, the authorities have tampered with temples built at least 200 years ago, have alterated havelies that are mapped as cultural centres, allowed mass private constructions and permitted non-adherence to the city’s identity—the pink colour/paint— in violation of the commitments made to the international body.

The steps of Laxmi Narayan Temple at Badi Chaupar were partially demolished to give way for an entry gate of metro station, while several old wooden gates with rare carvings were replaced by modern iron gates. Inconsistency in the pink hues in the markets can be seen in the same lane.

Over the years, hardly any clarification has been made by the authorities about the specific type of pink colour required to be painted.

In the official document to UNESCO, the architectural heritage of the Walled City Jaipur is divided into three types based on the time period. It says that even the restoration and conservation work should be done causing minimal damage to the actual site.

Unesco director general Audrey Azoulay during her visit to the city on Wednesday

JAIPUR: In her maiden visit to the city, Unesco director general Audrey Azoulay on Wednesday went to the Walled City , a world heritage site .

The director reached historic Amber Fort around 9:30 am and stayed for an hour touring it. Her tourist guide Narendra Chitawa told TOI, “She really enjoyed the tour and particularly liked Amber Fort. She also spoke about promoting indigenous arts and culture as she herself has keen interest in it.”

She then went to a girls’ school there. While interacting with the students, Azoulay encouraged them to contribute to the country with their education and skills. She took photographs with the girls, talked to them about education and later saw their classrooms. The students performed a self-defence demonstration on the occasion.

“Congratulations to all of you, teachers, pupils and families. Girls' education is the cause of our century. Girls, we need you!” Azoulay wrote on a photo frame prepared by the students. The girls had placed Azoulay's photo on one side of the frame and left a blank space for her comments.

After spending nearly 40 minutes in the school, she left for the iconic Hawa Mahal where she unveiled the World Heritage city engraved stone plaque. On the way, she briefly halted at Jal Mahal Ki Paal and took pictures.

The Walled City of Jaipur, known for its iconic architectural legacy and vibrant culture, was recognised as a Unesco world heritage site in July last year.

398,['6/02/2020'],Finance min likely to bet on KIIFB again,"This story is from February 6, 2020

Thiruvananthapuram: In 2019, finance minister T M Thomas Isaac was on a difficult mission: finding funds for the ambitious Rebuild Kerala programme to reconstruct a flood-ravaged state. Faced with a dip in revenue receipts amid mounting debts, it was practically impossible to ensure budgetary allocation for the project. In the end, he chose KIIFB (Kerala Infrastructure Investment Fund Board) to finance the project.

Isaac, who is facing a tough situation on the financial front this time, will once again be forced to depend on KIIFB to initiate major development works in state. The budget, which he is set to present on Friday, is unlikely to spring major surprises as he has a task at hand: complete the projects taken up by KIIFB.

With LDF entering its last year in power, no major development projects can be expected in the budget. But there are several projects that were taken up and left incomplete; most of them are infrastructure projects.

After the state government started totally depending on KIIFB for funding projects, all departments are now relying on it. KIIFB has given tenders for 347 projects at an estimated cost of Rs 13,616 crore. Till date, works started in 269 projects for which Rs 10,581 crore is the total outlay.

But mobilizing funds for KIIFB was not an easy task for Isaac. Though Pravasi Chitty was a concept to mobilize funds, it was not a success. The aim was to mobilize Rs 1,000 crore, but only Rs 135 crore could be raised using this plan.

Critics rate KIIFB as a bubble which will burst any time. With limited funds in its kitty, state government is going to struggle to repay the bonds it has taken and clear bills for the works it has sanctioned. However, Isaac has no worries since the repayment question will come into play only after May 2021.

Bhopal: Students, under the banner of NSUI, on Wednesday burnt the effigy of Bhoj University’s vice-chancellor, Jayant Sonwalkar, demanding his ouster. Sonwalkar has rubbished the allegations, calling them baseless.

NSUI’s spokesperson Vivek Tripathi alleged that the university had hit a low during the regime of V-C Sonwalkar. “Illegal appointments have been made by him. Rules and regulations were never followed while making such appointments that included teaching faculty also,” said Tripathi.

He added that contracts are being given out by the vice-chancellor without adopting the tender procedures, which has reportedly caused huge financial loss to the university and the government. “His (Sonwalkar’s) nexus with private institutions is something which needs to be probed,” added Tripathi.

“Appointments were made on the basis of fake papers, which are under investigation,” said Tripathi. Court orders have been continuously not followed in his regime,” said Tripathi.

When contacted, V-C Sonwalkar said, “I have never received any such complaints. No one has ever come to me with such allegations. What should I respond over such baseless claims?”

He said some students had come to him over PhD issues. “I have never done any wrong. Atithi Vidwans were appointed following all norms and regulations,” said Sonwalkar.

NSUI plans to file a complaint in Raj Bhavan and EOW, Lokayukta office along with all the evidences against Sonwalkar.

Ahmedabad: A few kilometres away from the state capital, tonnes of toxic hazardous waste, packed in HDPE bags was dumped at a private plot near an industrial estate by a tractor trailer. The local crime branch (LCB) of Gandhinagar had been tipped off on January 24 about the illegal toxic waste dumping that was to take place the same day. The waste originated at Virat Alloys Pvt Ltd located within the Dhanot GIDC complex. Police lodged a complaint against the owner of the company and the owner of the plot.

Police caught a tractor trailer and an earthmover from the open plot between Dharti-Apollo Industrial estate and Somany Ceramics near Kalol in Gandhinagar district. The Gandhinagar LCB in its FIR estimates that 20 tonnes of dark brown toxic acidic waste was packed in 15x5-foot high-density polyethylene bags, to be buried at the site.

Police informed the Gujarat Pollution Control Board (GPCB) and requested it to run scientific tests to ascertain the nature of the substance. The waste turned out to be effluent treatment plant (ETP) sludge, which had to be handled by a certified waste processing agency. The police and GPCB team visited the premises of the company in Dhanot GIDC and found some 40 tonnes of ETP waste waiting to be disposed, with another two tonnes of pickling waste lying unattended. Police booked the owner of Virat Alloys Pvt Ltd and the owner of the private plot.

Thousands of devotees descend on Medaram

MEDARAM: The 4-day Sammakka-Saralamma Jatara , or Medaram Jatara , got underway on Wednesday with the arrival of tribal deity Saralamma from Kannepally village. Tribal priests performed rituals at Kannepally village for about three hours, before stepping out of the temple with the deity — a casket of vermillion — in the presence of thousands of devotees on Wednesday evening.

The 4km road from Medaram from Kannepally was packed with devotees, waiting to catch a glimpse of the Goddess.

It became tough for the police to control the sea of devotees, who jostled with each other to touch the priests involved in the procession. Many devotees, especially those suffering from illnesses, were also seen rolling on the road with folded hands, wishing that the priests carrying the Goddess would walk over them. This ritual is known as ‘varam’ pattadam’. The procession started at 4pm and continued till 9pm.

Tribal priests had also reached Medaram with Saralamma’s husband, Govindarajulu and placed him alongside Saralamma. Govindarajulu who is in the form of ‘Pagida’ was treated as a groom ready for the wedding.

They also carried Pagididdaraju and placed him alongside Saralamma and Govindarajulu. Later, the rituals for the celestial wedding of Sammakka with Pagididdaraju began, which will end on Thursday after the arrival of Sammakka from Chilakalagutta.

Though the Jatara commenced formally on Wednesday, pilgrims have been thronging the shrine since a month now. On Wednesday, chief secretary Somesh Kumar and DGP M Mahender Reddy also inspected the arrangements at the jatara site, as directed by chief minister K Chandrashekhar Rao.

MANGALURU: The Dakshina Kannada district branch of Indian Red Cross Society (IRCS) as part of centenary year celebrations of Red Cross has decided to launch socially oriented programmes as part of the same. Setting up a help desk at Wenlock Hospital , inauguration of Prime Minister Jan Aushadi Kendra licensed to the district branch, strengthening of taluk units of the society and Youth Red Cross units in educational institutions are on the anvil.

S A Prabhakar Sharma, honorary secretary of the district branch told reporters that a 50-strong volunteer team, consisting mostly of senior citizens, will man the help desk at the Wenlock Hospital starting February 11. This facility is the need of the hour to guide patients and their attendants and direct them to the speciality department concerned, a need even deputy commissioner Sindhu B Rupesh, also president of the district branch, felt, he said.

A PM Jan Aushadi Kendra set up at Padavinangady under licence given to the district branch has been operational for some time now. With physicians coming forward to prescribe medicine available at the kendra, Sharma said this will immensely help people for the generic medicines dispensed here are available at 80% less than the market price. This kendra will be formally dedicated for public use at a simple ceremony to be held shortly, he said.

Shantharam Shetty, chairman of the branch, said a major project envisaged to mark centenary year is the construction of a Red Cross Bhavan. The DC has allotted 25 cents for this project on the DC office premises, he said, adding the branch with help from well-wishers and donors and from CSR funds, will start work on it at the earliest. This bhavan will help the branch to give greater thrust to the myriad activities that it undertakes, he noted.

The branch has started a Red Cross Clinic in association with NMPT at Panambur to help the unorganised labourers. Free consultation and medicines are made available to beneficiaries at this clinic. The branch has set a target to take the number of its life members from the present 2,100 to 2,500 and patron members from 29 to 100 during the centenary year.

Parvesh Verma

NEW DELHI: The Election Commission (EC) on Wednesday banned BJP functionary Parvesh Sahib Singh Verma from campaigning for the second time ahead of the Delhi assembly elections.

In a statement, the EC said that a 24-hour campaign ban was imposed on the BJP MP for his “terrorist” remark against CM Arvind Kejriwal . The ban came into force at 6 pm on Wednesday. Verma will not be able to further campaign for the polls as the electioneering ends at 5 pm on Thursday.

“Verma made vitriolic aspersions against Arvind Kejriwal, CM of Delhi, which violates the model code of conduct,” the Election Commission said in the statement.

Earlier, the election panel had issued a show-cause notice to Singh in the wake of his terrorist remark against the CM. “Verma submitted his reply on January 31 denying the allegations levelled against him,” the EC stated. However, “after scrutiny of the video, it was found that he had cast vitriolic aspersions on the chief minister,” the EC added in its order.

The ban also bars Verma from making public utterances for the print, electronic or social media in connection with the ongoing assembly elections.

Earlier, on January 30, the EC had barred the MP from campaigning for 96 hours following his remarks against anti-CAA protesters in Shaheen Bagh and his statement on removing mosques at a public meeting in Vikaspuri .

The EC also slapped a notice on BJP spokesperson Sambit Patra for prima facie violating the poll code with a remark that had the potential to disturb communal and religious harmony. It has sought an explanation from Patra by 5 pm on Thursday. The BJP leader had made the controversial remark at a TV show after which AAP lodged a complaint with the CEO office.

404,['6/02/2020'],Discontent over CP Yogeshwar’s likely induction forced Karnataka CM to change tack,"This story is from February 6, 2020

Cars with fancy numbers personally chosen by the 10 MLAs to be sworn in as ministers on Thursday, lined up at ... Read More

BENGALURU: Faced with the difficult task of pleasing both disqualified MLAs and BJP loyalists when he set out to expand his council of ministers, chief minister BS Yediyurappa eventually decided to side with the turncoats whose ‘sacrifice’ brought his government into existence.

Failing to strike the desired balance, he preferred to repay those who made him CM and keep loyalists on hold. Thus, instead of inducting 13 (10 turncoats plus three loyalists) into his cabinet as he originally intended, Yediyurappa decided only 10 of the 11 disqualified legislators, who won assembly bypolls on BJP tickets, will take oath on Thursday.

Having promised the disqualified MLAs who won the bypolls ministerial berths, Yediyurappa simply did not have the space to manoeuvre since only six vacant spots remained. There was speculation that he would induct 10+5, but that quickly died out.

As reported, Mahesh Kumatalli will be the lone turncoat to miss out on a berth, but Yediyurappa also decided to keep former MLA CP Yogeshwar’s elevation on hold. Yogeshwar had lost the 2018 assembly elections and is not a member of either house.

Yogeshwar’s name in the list had brought dissidence in the ranks to the fore, especially since Kumatalli — who is from the politically dominant Panchamasali sect of the Linagayat community — was denied a berth. Yogeshwar is a Vokkaliga.

Shorpur MLA Narasimha Nayak or Raju Gowda as he is popularly known opposed the inclusion of Yogeshwar, even as several Lingayat leaders expressed displeasure over Kumatalli being snubbed.

""Isolating Kumatalli alone would definitely send the wrong signal, but the inclusion of only a few from the old guard would have created greater trouble. So, the chief minister’s decision to go with turncoats alone for now seems pragmatic. It serves interests of the party,"" said former minister Murugesh Nirani, a Panchamasali Lingayat.

Another factor that dogged the CM’s expansion plans was the lack of representation from the coastal belt. Although the names of Angara S (Sullia) and Halady Srinivasa Shetty (Kundapur) cropped up, their inclusion was not practical at this point.

""Striking a fine balance between regions and giving equitable representation to communities was a concern. The decision to postpone the induction of BJP loyalists was good in this sense,"" said Lahar Singh Siroya, senior BJP MLC.

Now, with six vacancies in hand, Yediyurappa will have more space to manoeuvre when he expands his cabinet to the full quota — perhaps in July. By then, he can drop a handful from his cabinet and make further room for newcomers, while using the existing vacancies as a carrot to dangle before aspirants to keep them calm.

These visitors — two elephants — were found wandering in Gotegaon town and were kept overnight at the police station until their owners presented relevant permit documents.Two elephants were seen in Gotegaon on Sunday. When police came to know about it, their mahouts were quizzed about elephants’ identification and transportation permits. When they said they did not have the required documents, cops brought both the elephants to Gotegaon police station at around 5pm.Speaking to TOI, Gotegaon police station in-charge Prabhat Shukla said that like cattle, special chips are placed in the ears of elephants for identification. “Besides, special permits are also required for their transportation,” Shukla added. “When we enquired from the mahouts, they did have any documents. Thus, the animals were brought to the police station. However, the elephants had to be fed as well. So when we asked the mahouts about their eating habits, they informed us that they either eat specially-cooked food or tree barks or sugarcane. Since we could not prepare something special like large rotis for them, sugarcane was the option as it is found in abundance in Gotegaon,” he said.He added that one of the elephants belonged to a native of Chhatarpur while the other was owned by a person from Narsinghpur’s Tendukheda. “When the owners provided necessary papers for transportation and identification, the animals were released on Monday at around 11am,” he added.

AJMER: The city police on Wednesday recorded statements of three women IAS complainants in a case against Congress leader and advocate Rajesh Tandon for allegedly posting an absurd post on social media. The post mentioned about a woman IAS officer posted in Ajmer district but did not name her.

Police have not disclosed the names of the officers who have filed FIRs against Tandon. Earlier in the day, a group of lawyers asked the president and secretary of Ajmer BAR association to suspend the membership of advocate Tandon for his alleged post on social media.

Tandon, too, with another bunch of lawyers approached president of Ajmer BAR association and demanded that advocates should stand with him since the IAS Association has come out against him and he may not get justice.

Police investigating the case against Tandon will try to locate the video clip that he allegedly claimed in his social media post. The post of advocate Tandon allegedly claimed that there was a pornographic video in which a woman IAS officer in Ajmer was found in compromising state.

“No such video has surfaced so far and the post was based on rumours to degrade the dignity of women officers,” said a police source source.

Even accused Tandon accepted before media that he had not seen the video and wrote his post only on rumours.

Police sources said that Tandon has removed all such posts from his Facebook account but the cops were trying to recover these. Police will investigate the intention of the accused for writing such a post against woman IAS officer on social media.

Gold imports fell sharply from 2.56 metric tonnes in December 2019 to merely 0.92 MT in January

AHMEDABAD: Wedding season gold purchases have lost their sheen this January. Gold imports fell sharply from 2.56 metric tonnes in December 2019 to merely 0.92 MT in January, registering a decline of 64%.

“Geopolitical factors caused an increase in gold prices which touched record high levels breaching the Rs 42,000-mark for the first time. High prices in a slowdown situation are always a deterrent for gold purchases. Moreover, the Kamurta period till January 13 is considered quite inauspicious for gold purchases, as a result of which gold buying remained muted during the wedding season,” said Haresh Acharya, director, India Bullion and Jewellers’ Association (IBJA).

Analysts also said that several investors, jewellers as well as stockists were in wait-and-watch mode for purchases, in the wake of the Union budget announcement. “Industry stakeholders were hopeful of a cut on customs duty on gold from the existing 12.5% in the Budget announcement. This is why many deferred purchasing gold,” said Acharya.

Jewellers said that while the Kamurta period affected demand for gold jewellery, high prices led to a lot of purchases being made by exchanging old gold. “Most customers come with a fixed budget and come with old gold to be exchanged for purchases. This brings down the overall volume of gold traded,” said a senior member of Manek Chowk Choksi Mahajan.

Jewellers also said that the unseasonal rainfall had affected rural incomes to a great extent and as a result, gold demand from rural customers, which accounts for some 60% of the total demand, went further down.

Encroachment is rampant in the mela area's Bairagi camp

HARIDWAR: With less than a year to go for the Kumbh Mela to commence, the administration is still shying away from taking measures to remove illegal constructions by individuals and institutions on the mela land. While efforts are underway to include additional space in the existing mela area in view of increased land requirement cited by akharas, it seems that a blind eye is being turned on encroachments, an official who had been associated with Kumbh 2010 told TOI.

“This is a huge area of concern and raises doubts regarding timely completion of the mela arrangements,” the former official added. In the Bairagi Camp area alone, there are about 1000 pucca houses besides 40 ashrams illegally constructed on the mela land, Kamaleshwar Mishra , a retired BSNL officer residing in the area alleged.

A few months ago, chief secretary Utpal Kumar Singh had also pointed out during a meeting that large-scale encroachment on Kumbh mela land in Haridwar is a problem that must be addressed on a priority basis.

However, precious little has been done towards this end. A few minor drives are occasionally carried out as was done earlier this week when a team of officials from the irrigation department and Haridwar Roorkee Development Authority went to Bairagi Camp. “All they did were demolish a few pillars and stopped construction of a cowshed in an ashram. In the vicinity, there are dozens of ashrams including Sadhana Sadan, Uma Maheshwar Ashram, Mauni Baba Ashram, Akiya Dham and Sachidanand Ashram, besides hundreds of houses of individuals situated on encroached land but no action was taken against them,” a resident of the area told TOI.

When queried about the issue, additional mela officer Harvir Singh said, “The construction which had recently been started, has been stopped. For removal of other encroachments which are already identified, a team will be constituted.”

Arun Manav, a local resident, alleged that the administration must act swiftly especially against ashrams that have been built on the land allotted to seers for camps in Kumbh 2010. “Forget opposing permanent construction illegally done on the mela land, seers are demanding more land in the mela area for the forthcoming Kumbh.”

‘Committee to be set up for inter-departmental co-ordination to speed up Kumbh work’

Haridwar: At a Kumbh 2021 review meeting held at the Central Control Room (CCR) in Haridwar on Wednesday, Garhwal commissioner Ravinath Raman told officials that efforts be made to complete permanent works related to the mega festival by October-November. He added that a committee will soon be set up for inter-departmental co-ordination. Speakinjg to TOI, Raman said that in certain departments, re-tendering has been necessitated due to contractors refusing to do the work allotted to them whereas in some others, officials have been asked to increase supervision in view of complaints regarding work quality. “Due to Char Dham and kanwar yatra, there will be big challenges before the Kumbh administration. But it should be their endeavour to ensure that neither is any inconvenience caused to the pilgrims, nor does the Kumbh work suffer,” he said.

410,['6/02/2020'],950 dumper-loads of waste cleared from Jayanthi nullah,"This story is from February 6, 2020

The overflowing sewage causes pollution in the Panchaganga river

KOLHAPUR: The Kolhapur Municipal Corporation (KMC) has removed 950 dumper-loads of waste material from the Jayanthi nullah in the past three weeks.

The KMC officials said that the capacity of the nullah to hold sewage has been increased by 1 million litres. The work to remove the solid waste was initiated after there was an overflowing of sewage from the check dam located at the Khanvilkar Petrol pump.

The overflowing sewage causes pollution in the Panchaganga river. The experts suggested the removal of solid waste from the nullah so that the overflowing of the waste water can be stopped.

The capacity of the pumping station has been the same for many years and it also requires an upgrade to ensure that every drop of waste water flowing into the longest nullah is diverted for treatment at the plant located at Kasba Bawda.

R K Patil, the deputy hydraulic engineer of KMC said, “Usually the nullah overflows during the rainy days as the quantity of waste water entering the nullah from its catchment area increases. We were reported that a huge quantity of solid waste is thrown in the nullah. The action against those dumping the waste will be taken.

The nullah’s capacity to store the waste water has increased. A huge amount of solid waste is thrown in the nullah only at some stretches. We are putting the boards displaying messages not to throw the waste into it. Also, the health department is going to ensure that adequate bins are placed along the nullah stretch.”

The KMC is also going to clean some stretches of Gomati nullah which joins Jayanthi nullah at Hutatma Park.

The Gomati nullah which originates at Shivaji University is also loaded with solid waste especially when it passes through the industrial areas of Udyamnagar. An appeal will be made to people to participate in the drive to clean Gomati nullah.

NEW DELHI: Fifty protesters at Shaheen Bagh have been issued notices by police under CrPC sections 105/151 for disrupting peace and tranquility of the area during the anti-CAA protests. They will have to appear before a magistrate and explain their position.

Police sources said “binding down” notices under CrPC sections 107/150 have also been issued to 2,539 people across the city for creating a ruckus. “Some people issued the notices have already appeared. People are bound down in the area to ensure peace and good behaviour from them so that no untoward incident occurs,” said a police officer.

Delhi Police had requisitioned for 18,000 personnel from central forces to be deployed across the city along with nearly one lakh policemen from Thursday till the end of the elections on Tuesday. Apart from policemen on poll duty, Delhi Police will deploy all personnel from the PCR and communication units on the roads. In all, 20,000 additional personnel from reserve battalions will be deployed for law and order duties.

Sources said special focus will be on areas where anti-CAA protests are taking place. Security forces have been put on alert to thwart any protests near the polling booths. A total of 837 people with criminal records have been put under preventive custody. More than one lakh people have been booked under Delhi Police Act for defacement and creating a nuisance.

Sensitive and hypersensitive zones were demarcated using previous records of violence after consultation with the Election Commission. Some of the hypersensitive booths are in Seemapuri in Shahdara, Seelampur in northeast Delhi, Adarsh Nagar and Bharat Nagar in northwest Delhi, Karol Bagh, Patel Nagar and Chandni Mahal in central Delhi, and Najafgarh, Mundka, Sultanpuri and Nangloi in outer Delhi.

412,['6/02/2020'],State wakes up to online sexual abuse of the young,"This story is from February 6, 2020

Chennai: “We have lost the battle"". The frustrated cry of activists battling to stem the tide of child sex abuse material (CSAM) online tells the story in a nutshell. From images of a sexually abused newborn with umbilical cord intact to a 16-page manual by a father on how to rape his daughter, the online onslaught is distressing even for internet watchers authorized to track the web for disturbing content.

What’s worrying is that the infection is spreading closer home. And, India has only just begun the battle. Countries like the US, UK and Canada have already taken the deep dive into the dark depths of the digital world. Last September, Interpol stepped in to alert India about Tamil Nadu and Kerala ranking high, along with Delhi, Maharashtra, Gujarat, Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal, in the number of people watching obscene content involving children online. One of the recent CBI investigations began after information about a German national Sasche Treppke being convicted in that country for distributing CSAM among 29 WhatsApp groups. Seven Indians, including two from Chennai, were members of these groups.

On November 15, the CBI set up a specialised unit to tackle the problem of CSAM. Following a Supreme Court order, Tamil Nadu too constituted a special wing for crimes against women and children. The state was divided into regions headed by three officers. The special wing, headed by nodal officer V Jayashri, was given the task of cracking down on those who possess or manufacture offensive material. ""Child sex abuse material has been circulated since the dawn of internet. But only now we have created the cyber wing,"" admitted ADGP M Ravi, who heads Tamil Nadu’s special wing to fight crimes against women and children. Cyber cells have been created in every district of Tamil Nadu to coordinate better. But, resources available are pathetically meagre to tackle the task in hand.

Though there have been a few arrests of people downloading and sharing sexual images of children, Tamil Nadu has a long way to go. ""Most people don’t know that the offence comes under sections of the IT Act as well as Pocso now,"" said Jayashri.

While information exchange with international agencies is giving a fair idea of the nature and extent of the problem, arrests on the ground are hardly enough. In January, the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, a US-based NGO, alerted the Union ministry of home affairs (MHA) about more than 25,000 cases of suspected abusive content being uploaded across social media platforms in India in the past five months. Though the MHA launched www.cybercrime.gov.in to encourage people to report CSAM and rape images, the complaints went into the regular policing slot and proved to be just another cog in the wheel.

""A lot of pictures of girls in Kerala are uploaded. And, it takes a lot of effort to get to the victims,"" said Kerala additional director general of police Manoj Abraham, nodal officer of the state police cyberdome, leading ‘Operation P Hunt’ to zero in on child sex offenders. ""Complaints don’t come. We tracked some of the offenders after we noticed a Malayalam Manorama calendar and a Malayalam magazine in the offending visuals,"" said the officer. Last October, 22 men were picked up by Abraham’s team for using WhatsApp, Facebook and Telegram groups to share CSAM.

Realising that collaboration with multiple agencies is key to tackling the issue, the Kerala government recently inaugurated a dedicated centre to tackle online sex abuse of children that will work with agencies like Interpol, The International Centre for Missing & Exploited Children, US, and the NCRB. The more chilling aspect is the self-generated images by children, coerced or unwitting, and the challenges this present to cyber forensics in the country.

Further, a person viewing and sharing obscene images of children is not always part of organised gangs, which need to be prosecuted first. ""Arresting and prosecuting a couple of people will not really make a dent, but might lull society into thinking the situation is safer,"" said Vidya Reddy of Tulir, a centre for the prevention and healing of child sexual abuse. Apart from a legislative framework, psychological counselling too plays a role to deter the crime. ""With the mandatory reporting under Pocso, it is hard to assist those who may have sexual interest in children, to seek help before they actually abuse children,"" said Vidya.

413,['6/02/2020'],"VK Sasikala: Rajinikanth type relief eludes VK Sasikala, I-T refuses to withdraw case","This story is from February 6, 2020

VK Sasikala

CHENNAI: About a week after the income tax department withdrew its case against actor Rajinikanth , who had been imposed Rs 66 lakh penalty, expelled AIADMK leader V K Sasikala failed to earn a similar reprieve from the department.

On Wednesday the income tax department refused to withdraw an appeal pending against Sasikala in the Madras high court, though the value of the appeal was below Rs 1 crore.

Recently, the department chose to withdraw a similar appeal pending against Rajinikanth citing a circular issued by central board of direct taxes (CBDT) dated September 8, 2019, directing the department to not go on appeal in cases valued below Rs 1 crore. The department was also instructed to withdraw all such pending appeals in various courts across the country.

However, tax department counsel T R Senthil Kumar informed the high court on Wednesday that Sasikala could not seek relief under the circular since prosecution had already been initiated in her case. “Though the circular provides for withdrawal of appeals valued below Rs 1 crore, it would not apply to cases in which there is an objection raised by the revenue audit or prosecution has been already initiated,” Senthil Kumar said.

Recording his submission, a division bench of Justice Vineet Kothari and Justice R Suresh Kumar directed the department to file a report on the status of the prosecution in two weeks.

The issue pertains to returns filed by Sasikala for assessment year 1994-95 for Rs 28.86 lakh. Subsequently, a raid conducted by Directorate of Vigilance and Anti-Corruption (DVAC) found that she had concealed purchase of 80 acres of land during the assessment year. Therefore, based on the DVAC report, the income tax department passed an order dated March 14, 2002, demanding tax to the tune of Rs 48 lakh.

Aggrieved, Sasikala challenged the order before the income tax appellate tribunal (ITAT) which quashed the assessment order. Challenging the tribunal’s order, the department moved the present appeal in the high court.

When the plea came up for hearing, Sasikala’s counsel contended that she is entitled to relief in view of the CBDT’s circular.

Wardha: The state government on Wednesday granted 12 lakh compensation to Ankita Pisudde, a 25-year-old college teacher who was set ablaze by a stalker in Hinganghat on Monday. Wardha district administration on Wednesday transferred 4 lakh to Orange City Hospital and Research Institute (OCHRI) towards her treatment.

Ankita’s condition remained critical on Wednesday but her vitals are stable. She underwent second debridement and dressing, as per the hospital.

According to Wardha district collector Vivek Bhimanwar, a provision of around Rs12 lakh has been made as per estimates given by the hospital. “Rs4 lakh have been deposited in the hospital’s account, which should be enough at this stage,” he said.

Apart from staging protests in Hinganghat over the incidents, people are also praying for well-being of the victim. Prayers were organized in temples on Wednesday.

Vaishali Bhute, resident of Sayaji Nagar in Hinganghat, said that all women from her colony prayed for improvement in Ankita’s condition. “Her condition is very critical. We are chanting Mahamutranjay Mantra with a belief that the almighty will save her,” she said.

Giving a political twist to the case, state vice-president of BJP Chitra Wagh said the state government delayed the compensation. “The amount was given after efforts taken by BJP,” she claimed.

The accused, Vikesh Nagrale, is in Hinganghat police custody till February 8.

Vivek Timande of Daroda village from where Ankita hails, said that Nagrale was warned by her parents several times. “They were friends a year ago but since then she had been avoiding him,” he said.

On Wednesday, Nagpur divisional commissioner Sanjeev Kumar, Dr Sanjeev Jaiswal, Nagpur division deputy director health services, Sanjay Bhargava, on behalf of Bajaj Foundation Wardha, Aparna Kolhe, Nagpur district women’s & child development officer, and Rupali Chakankar, women state president, NCP, visited OCHRI to enquire about the status of the patient.

Bhopal: State cabinet headed by chief minister Kamal Nath on Wednesday approved to promulgate the Madhya Pradesh Scheduled Tribe Rinn Vimukti Ordinance, 2020. State law minister PC Sharma said, “Under this, all loans taken by members of the tribal community till August 15, 2019 will be waived. The decision has been taken in the cabinet meeting.”

The minister claimed all loans, irrespective of their nature or amount, will be waived. These include loans taken from both nationalised and private banks.

This loan waiver is in addition to the announcement made by chief minister Kamal Nath on the occasion of International Day for Indigenous People on August 9 last year.

No one needs to back loans taken from private moneylenders, not even the state government, chief minister Nath had said.

The Kamal Nath government had waived-off the loans taken from non-licenced moneylenders through an amendment made in the Anusuchit Janjaati Sahukar Viniyam (Scheduled Tribes Moneylenders Regulations, 1972).

Cabinet also decided to implement the ‘Madhya Pradesh Hybrid Renewable Energy and Energy Storage Policy’ for development of renewable energy projects in the state. This will include electricity generation from two or more renewable energy sources at a project site.

Government also endorsed the amendment of Indira Gandhi Samaj Seva Puraskar 1992 to increase the amount of the award from Rs1 lakh to Rs10 lakhs for the award to institutions working for the poor and the differently-abled in the social sector.

In another decision, council of ministers increased the limit of voluntary grants given by ministers from Rs20,000 to Rs40,000. Cabinet also approved continuation of the scheme for expansion of state assembly building and MLA rest-house under the Urban Development and Housing Department.

The Cabinet endorsed the proposal for amendment of probation period, pay scales and reservation rules in the Rajya School Shiksha Seva (Education Cadre) Conditions and Recruitment Rules, 2018, under the department of school education. Similarly, it was also decided to make an amendment in the Madhya Pradesh Tribal and Scheduled Caste Education Cadre, Service and Recruitment Rules, 2018.

Council of ministers decided make amendment regarding the recruitment process in the State Service Examination Rules 2015 related to the State Service Examination conducted by Madhya Pradesh Public Service Commission.

Nagpur: Confederation of All India Traders ( CAIT ) in a communication sent to Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman has drawn the attention of government over rapid increase in number of dishonoured cheques.

Traders of the country are perturbed over frequent instances of cheque dishonouring and the long time it takes to get justice after that. CAIT has suggested for setting up of fast track courts to deal with cheque bounce cases.

CAIT national president BC Bhartia drew Sitharaman’s attention towards the 213th Law Commission Report which says that about 40 lakh cheque bounces cases are being heard in the courts. This makes it clear that the single category of cases constitute a major portion of all pending litigation in the judicial system, said the CAIT letter.

A Supreme Court bench headed by Justice Adarsh Kumar Goel observed on June 20, 2018, that more than 20% of the cases in subordinate cases were related to cheque dishonour, says the CAIT letter.

BHOPAL: A man in Anuppur district allegedly faked the death of his own mother and got a death certificate issued from the civic body in order to withdraw money deposited by his late father in a bank account whose sole nominee was his mother.

The accused, who was arrested by Anuppur police on January 29, was presented in court which later rejected his bail.

Incident took place at ward number 6 of Bijuri town of Anuppur district.

Accused Vinod Kumar Pandey, 58, a resident of ward number 6 in Anuppur district’s Bijuri town, was arrested by police following a complaint by his younger brother Pradumn Narayan Pandey.

Speaking to TOI, Bijuri police station head constable Istiyaq Khan said, “A complaint was received from the accused’s brother who stated that he had made a fake death certificate of their mother. Detailed investigations were carried after which the allegations were found to be true. A case was registered against the accused under sections 467 ( forgery for purpose of cheating) and 468 (forgery of valuable security, will, etc) and he was arrested on January 29 and produced before court.”.

He added, “The court rejected his bail and later another bail petition before higher court of sessions judge was also rejected. He is in jail now”.

Khan said there had been some dispute between the brothers. The accused somehow managed to make a fake death certificate of his 80-year-old mother who is still alive. “However, he had not used the certificate to withdraw money or anything else,” Khan said.

“Pandey’s younger brother came to know about this and lodged a complaint alleging that he had made a fake death certificate to withdraw their father’s money. The allegations about fake death certificate were found to be true,” Khan added.

The food grains and other material were then sold in black in the open market with fair price shop owners pocketing the difference.“We still don’t know the material of the fingerprint casts.

With officials claiming that the Anandbagh RUB will be open to public this year, TOI asked readers if the RUB will put an end to traffic woes

Do you think the RUB will help ease traffic woes in Anandbagh and adjoining areas?

While there is no doubt that the RUB (if at all completed) will ease traffic congestion. As a senior citizens I wonder if I will be able to see the RUB open for public within my lifespan!

Kasturi Rangan

Proper planning should go into all aspects of the RUB. A flyover or RuB made for present vehicular volume may not be able to handle the load five decades down the line. A more constructive study is needed to build the RUB to ease traffic at Anandbagh and adjoining areas. A wider one would be must sustainable keeping in mind the ever growing traffic menace of the city. More funds should be diverted to construct a big and wide RuB so that the money, time and labour being invested is worth it. All land acquisitions and demarcation for wider RuBs should be done so that authorities are prepared for widening of RuB. Encroachments should be strictly contained.

Deepesh Surana.

Yes, the Anandbagh RUB will definitely help ease the traffic woes in the area. It is high time that the authorities completed the RUB that has been stalled for far too long. The officials should address the concerns of the people and also collaborate with experts to ensure that the RUB is effective.

Venkat

The RUB was planned several years ago to ease the traffic. We need to ask why it has been in the backburner for so long. The traffic congestion in most of the areas in Secunderabad is very severe. GHMC and R & B should worl together to evolve a long term plan to ease the traffic. The issue is that the volume of traffic is going to increase while the width of roads are going to remain the same. Unless government takes up road widening work or alternative measures such as FOBs, fly overs and RUBs, we will not be able to control the traffic snarls.

Dr GV Kumar

The density of traffic in Anandbagh and its surroundings is very high throughout the day and as a result, one witnesses frequent traffic snarls. The RUB work was taken up in 2014 but laxity on the part of GHMC officials, the task has been left incomplete, defeating the very purpose of the RUB. Due to this, the traffic woes have only multiplied leaving the residents fuming. However, once the RUB is thrown open, certainly it would be to able to solve traffic woes to a large extent.

TRICHY: A 38-year-old man who had returned from China has been quarantined at the Mahatma Gandhi Memorial Government Hospital (MGMGH) in Trichy on Tuesday after he developed symptoms of novel coronavirus - fever and sore throat.Sources said the man hailed from Pudukottai district and was employed in a company in China. He returned to his native place through the Trichy International Airport on January 31.Since he had no symptoms of the disease on the day of his arrival, the health department officials allowed him to go home. Two days later, he developed fever and sore throat following which he came forward to admit himself at MGMGH, a tertiary care centre for Trichy and neighbouring districts, on Tuesday night.The doctors took his blood sample and sent it to King Institute in Chennai to check whether he was infected with nCoV. Dean of MGMGH Dr K Vanithamani said on Wednesday evening that the patient was stable in the isolation ward.The hospital administration also heaved a sigh of relief after a 27-year-old man of Madurai tested negative for nCoV, following which he was discharged on Wednesday. He had been admitted to the hospital as he had fever when he landed at the Trichy airport from Singapore in the early hours of February 2.“He was discharged from the hospital since he tested negative and had no symptoms of nCoV. Public need not panic as proper and early treatment in the isolation ward at the government hospitals will completely cure the patients. But we have no positive cases of novel coronavirus so far,” said the dean.In another case, a 32-year-old man of Tiruvarur who wanted to go back to China for work was admitted to the Tiruvarur GH as his company in China laid down a condition that he can join duty only after producing a ‘no objection certificate’ from the health officials in India that he was not infected with nCoV.“He had no symptoms, but as he wanted to get a diagnosis done, he was admitted to the hospital. His blood sample has been sent to the King Institute,” said dean of Tiruvarur Government Medical College Hospital Dr J Muthukumaran.A 35-year-old man from Needamangalam was also admitted to the hospital with fever and cough on February 3.

JAIPUR: Churu police arrested two Iranians who had stolen Rs 50,000 from the complainant in Ratangarh on pretext of wanting to see the Indian currency. The accused were arrested from Karnataka and were brought to Churu on Wednesday.

The accused were identified as Mehraj and Hadi , and both hail from Iran . “On January 6, the accused came to Ratangarh and got into a conversation with the complainant and expressed a desire to see Indian currency. The complainant showed them Rs 2,000 and Rs 500 notes, then kept them back. While one of the accused kept him busy in the conversation, the other accused quietly took the money. Both of them then absconded with the money,” said an official of Ratangarh police station.

After the case was lodged, the police started a search for the accused and checked the veracity of the complaint by looking at the CCTV footage. A team was constituted which started a search for the foreigners.

“We started tracing their movement and went to Delhi, Mumbai, Haryana and Karnataka. Through sources, we confirmed their location in Karnataka and arrested them from Karwar police station area,” added the official.

According to police, the accused had assumed that cops were not on their trail. “The accused had rented a car from Delhi for travelling around the country and had assumed that they would not be traced. If they had tried to hide then it would have been difficult. We are questioning them to find out if they were involved in other cases too,” a police officer said.

Manish Sisodia campaigned along with Bhagwant Mann, AAP MP from Punjab's Sangrur, at West Vinod Nagar

NEW DELHI: Even BJP workers accept that children in Delhi government schools are getting the best education , deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia claimed on Wednesday while addressing a public meeting at West Vinod Nagar falling under his assembly constituency, Patparganj .

“A prominent BJP worker, who had been campaigning against AAP’s education initiatives, recently took out his daughter from a private school and got her enrolled in a Delhi government school,” said the education minister, who was campaigning along with Bhagwant Mann , the party MP from Punjab’s Sangrur.

Crediting school teachers and the education team for the improvement, he said, “Even at private schools, we never allowed any fee hike. In comparison, the fees at Noida and Ghaziabad schools are way higher.”

On the development work in his constituency, the MLA said there was not even a single stretch in Patparganj that was not carpeted in the past five years. “Due to the rebates in electricity and water bills, 72,000 households are getting zero electricity bills here.”

While earlier development work used to get delayed due to a corrupt system, “an honest government is now working day and night for the city”, Sisodia said, adding that he felt proud to be part of a government working for the uniform development of society.

“This election is not about any particular party or candidate but about the kind of development and governance model people want to see in future,” the minister said while urging the crowd to vote for AAP if they wanted the government’s welfare schemes to continue.

Mann also requested people to choose the real issues over the politics of polarisation. “I am sure the people in Delhi will vote for development over those trying to divide society on the basis of slogans.” Slamming BJP’s politics of arrogance, Mann said the election commission even had to act against some BJP’s functionaries. “Senior BJP MPs have only one issue — Shaheen Bagh. When your government has brought this law, it is your responsibility to find a solution.”

Reminding the crowd that BJP is calling a chief minister who has worked hard a terrorist, Mann said, “February 8 is an opportunity to give answers to such people.”

Representative image

BENGALURU: The state government has decided to build the International Institute of Information Technology in Raichur on a public private partnership (PPP) model, but rather than partner with a private player for the purpose, it has decided to rope in Karnataka Power Corporation Limited (KPCL), its wholly owned subsidiary.

KPCL MD V Ponnuraj confirmed the corporation’s involvement and said it is likely to front Rs 19 crore. ""KPCL has a considerable presence in the district and it was decided that our involvement in setting up a world-class institute would be ideal,"" Ponnuraj told TOI.

Based on recommendations of the state government, which pushed for a world-class institution in Kalyana-Karnataka, a backward region, the Union ministry of human resources development sanctioned the IIIT in Raichur in January 2018.

However, two years on, the first batch of students is working out of the IIT campus in Hyderabad as there is no sign of the Raichur campus. Earlier this year, the government decided to move the college to a newly constructed block on the government engineering college campus in Raichur.

""We have almost completed the new block exclusively for the IIIT, but it will be a temporary one,"" said Raichur deputy commissioner R Venkatesh Kumar. He said 65 acres has been allotted to the IIIT trust.

The problem for the state has been funding. It would require about Rs 75 crore to establish the new IIIT and the cash-rich KPCL will be the government’s industry partner.

Ponnuraj said KPCL will provide assistance in civil engineering and other aspects and in return it will be accommodated on the IIIT Raichur board. Meanwhile, the state will contribute Rs 45 crore over a period of four years beginning next fiscal and will allocate Rs 11 crore in the first year. The project is expected figure in the state budget to be presented on March 5 by chief minister BS Yediyurappa.

Elders of Tidiyan village in Usilampatti say the two-foot tall sculpture of Packya Nathan and his wife was ere... Read More

CHENNAI: Tamil Nadu has a vibrant tradition of erecting memorial stones for heroes. The memorial stones with Tamil Brahmi inscriptions found in Pulimankombai and Thathapatti are considered the oldest (300BC) in the region.

Memorial stones with figures have been discovered from many parts of the state, but a rare modern one for a teacher and his wife found abandoned near the Sonaimuthaiah temple at Tidiyan village in Usilampatti points to the fact that the tradition existed till the 1960s.

""The people today don’t know the significance of the stone. The elders said it was erected in memory of a great teacher and his wife. This shows that the tradition of erecting hero stones existed till the 1960s,"" said K T Gandhirajan, a rock art expert who recently documented the memorial stone in Tidiyan.

Memorial stones broadly refer to the various kinds of monuments erected in remembrance of the dead (hero stones, religious commemoration and nisitikai).

Hero stone refers only to those erected for people who contributed to the welfare of or sacrificed their life for society or community.

It is believed that the two-foot-tall sculptures of teacher Packya Nathan and his wife were erected by his relatives and villagers for the good work he did by providing education to children from poor families. ""Hero stones are found in many sizes and styles. They talk about a lot of cultural significance of the period they belong to. This is the first time we came across a memorial stone for a teacher and that’s why it is unique,"" he said.

The Sangam literature talks a lot about memorial stones as ‘nadukal’ (planted stones).

""This memorial stone is significant because we believe the tradition was lost in the beginning of the 20th century. We need to study in detail to know more about this piece,"" said K Bhoopathy, a retired history professor based in Madurai.

""The hero stones were erected in memory of heroes who laid their life, defending their territory or making some form of supreme sacrifice for the sake of the community or the region,"" he said.

More than 2,500 such hero stones have been discovered in many parts of Tamil Nadu, but they have not been documented by the state archaeology department or the ASI. Many face threats from vandals because of lack of protection.

CHENNAI: Southeast Asian countries seem to have fallen out of favour among travellers planning trips for the Valentine’s Day weekend, Holi holidays and summer vacation because more cases of novel coronavirus have been detected in Singapore, Malaysia and Thailand — among the most popular destinations from Chennai. Instead, the Middle East and Europe have emerged as alternative destinations.This has begun to reflect on airfares. Return fares to Southeast Asian countries have begun to decrease but fares to the Middle East have started to rise for bookings in March.One-way fares on the Chennai-Singapore route are hovering in the range of Rs 5,000–Rs 7,000, while fares to Dubai are in the range of Rs 7,000–Rs 10,000 for travel in March and April. Fares on the Singapore route are expected to decrease further in the coming days.Travel and tour companies too have begun suggesting alternative destinations for travellers because panic has gripped authorities in Singapore after around 18 coronavirus cases were detected.The virus has also begun spreading in Macau, Thailand, Philippines, Vietnam, Hong Kong and Japan which have emerged as new destinations in the last few years for those who have visited to Thailand, Malaysia and Singapore. There is more concern among the tourists over visiting these countries because they get many travellers from China.This will be the first time, travellers would be moving away from Southeast Asian nations for summer vacation travel.Basheer Ahmed of Metro Travels said: “Leisure travellers, who used to visit Singapore on weekends have stopped travelling.

TRICHY: Commemorating World Cancer Day 2020 with the theme ‘I am and I Will’, survivors shared their memories of will power and consistent medication to defeat the disease, here on Wednesday.

Indian Medical Association – Trichy branch, Dr G Viswanathan Group of Hospitals, Dr G Viswanathan CBCC Centre and Dr K Shantha Breast Cancer Foundation, Trichy jointly observed World Cancer Day at the IMA hall Trichy. The doctors honoured the cancer conquerors to spread the message that most cancers can be conquered if detected early.

A 91-year-old man who was diagnosed with stomach cancer and survived 14 years, also participated in the event along with 19 cancer conquerors. A 19-year-old young man diagnosed with cancer in the head and neck and survived four years, spoke on how it can be conquered and how mental well-being was important to conquer cancer.

A woman diagnosed with a bilateral breast cancer, conqueror for the last 10 years spoke the path she walked after diagnosing.

Pink balloons were released by the cancer conquerors during the event.

This year’s theme for World Cancer Day 2020 “I am and I will” highlights the value of every individual to fight against cancer. Doctors said that cancer occurs due to uncontrolled abnormal growth of cells in the tissue or organs of the body.

They also expressed concern about the growing number of cancer patients across the world. In India, almost 12 lakh are diagnosed every year and out of which, 50% of the cancer patients do not survive. It was the second leading cause of death globally. The most alarming fact about cancer is that it takes a toll on children and young adults.

S Janani functioning as one hour principal on Wednesday

TRICHY: Sitting on a headmaster’s chair was something that 11-year-old S Janani of class V had only dreamed about. But on Wednesday, she was not only occupying the chair for an hour but was also functioning as a headmistress.

A student of Panchayat union primary school (PUPS) in Lingathur village near Thanthoni of Karur district , she was rewarded for successfully reciting a multiplication table till 9 in the classroom without stammering.

The school had announced that students memorizing multiplication tables will be given an opportunity to become headmaster/mistress of the school.

While the activity was given last Friday, three students of Class V were successful in reciting the tables on Monday. S Lokesh and C Sathyapriya too had this opportunity on Monday and Tuesday respectively.

On Wednesday, it was Janani’s turn who said that she always wanted to know how it feels to occupy the headmaster’s seat. More exciting was the fact that the headmaster was sitting opposite to her and taking instructions as an advisor.

She was busy giving homework to her fellow classmates and students of lower classes apart from making corrections to the homework done by the students. “I am happy that I could occupy the seat, but I want to occupy the district collector’s seat,” said Janani though she could not explain the reason for developing that interest.

“We were evolving ways to make students memorize multiplication tables. Our objective was to create an excitement among students so that they go for it with interest,” said headmaster Baranidaran.

“While all the eight students in class V attempted, only three could make it. We expect that they will be able to do it in the coming days,” he said.

To ensure that it should not be a mere ritual, Baranidaran said even if the chief education officer visits the school when children are functioning as headmaster/ mistress, they will be introduced as such.

PUPS Lingathur village is one of many schools in the state run by just two teachers. With a strength of 25 students, Baranidaran could manage the classes in the absence of his colleague who is away for a training.

NEW DELHI: Four days before Delhi goes to polls, concerns over the firing incident at Shaheen Bagh figured in the discussion during Zero Hour in Rajya Sabha . BJP member Bhupender Yadav sought action against those “criminalising Delhi elections”.

Soon after ministers tabled listed papers, member Vijay Goel (BJP) tried to raise the issue of firing in Shaheen Bagh and those behind the incident. This was strongly opposed by some of the Congress members. However, chairman M Venkaiah Naidu did not allow Goel to proceed with his arguments and asked members to raise permitted issues for Zero Hour.

Later, BJP MP Bhupender Yadav, as part of his Zero Hour mention, referred to the coming Delhi assembly elections and without naming any party or place referred to the firing incident. RS chairman made it clear that no references to any party or person will go on record.

“The Delhi elections are being watched with much interest not just nationally but also internationally. People were astonished by the fact that in Delhi, where elections are known to happen peacefully, suddenly at a certain spot incidents of firing were reported,” Yadav said.

He went on to say that when the police released the photograph of the person who indulged in firing, a political party held a press conference and issued a statement saying that a legal notice will be issued to the police.

Yadav said if administration and police were doing their job, then it is important for all political parties to follow the instructions of the Election Commission and not talk of issuing legal notices to police officials.

JAIPUR: Eight months after Pink City was included in the list of World Heritage Sites, the city received the Unesco certificate at Albert Hall here on Wednesday.

The twilight setting with a bit of chill in the air was perfect for the occasion as Unesco director general Audrey Azoulay handed over the certificate to the state government.

Speaking on the occasion, Azoulay said, “I came here from our headquarters in Paris with a message and recognition of the international community to the people of Jaipur for their outstanding efforts to preserve and conserve the cultural heritage for a sustainable future. Unesco is very proud to have the Walled City of Jaipur in the list of World Heritage Sites. Jaipur is already an iconic city because of its heritage and has a special place in the world. This inscription goes further and is a joint commitment to protect and preserve this heritage for the future.”

“Unesco and India have a history of strategic partnership based on cultural diversity, on the legacy of Mahatma Gandhi and on our joint commitment for education,” she said.

Emphasizing the importance of certification, the DG said that this recognition would help in developing responsible tourism.

In July 2019, Jaipur was included in the heritage list at the 43rd session of the World Heritage Committee(WHC) at Azerbaijan’s Baku. The city, founded by Sawai Jai Singh II in 1727, is the second Indian city to feature on the prestigious list.

Chief minister Ashok Gehlot , who missed the ceremony due to ill health, tweeted, “Delighted and proud that Jaipur has got the Unesco Heritage Certificate. I dedicate the honour to people of Pink City and state. Jaipur is one of the most well planned and beautiful cities of the world. Let us preserve the heritage of the capital city.”

A state government source said the World Heritage Committee (WHC) had outlined six points to be followed by the state government. On implementing the same, UDH minister Shanti Dhariwal said, “A state-level committee, headed by the chief secretary, was constituted by the state government. All concerned departments were given responsibility to maintain the heritage as per special area plan. We have carried out 360-degree videography and prepared three dimensional map of the Walled City area using drones to maintain our heritage record.”

Thiruvananthapuram: Forest and wildlife minister K Raju assured the House that the proposed demarcation of ‘ eco-sensitive areas ’ around wildlife sanctuaries would not hinder the normal life and agriculture activities of people near the sanctuaries and other forest areas in the state.

Replying to a calling attention motion by C K Saseendran in the assembly, the minister said the proposed eco-sensitive area would be maximum of up to 1km radius from wildlife sanctuary borders. “It would have a radius of 0 to 1km. This would only affect red industries in the area and operation of saw mills would be banned. There would be no hindrance for any other ongoing activities. The proposal in this regard has been submitted to the central government for approval,” Raju said.

In view of the natural calamities the state witnessed in recent years, the government was not in favour of further reducing the size and reach of eco-sensitive cover around wildlife sanctuaries. “The area has been defined following directives from the Supreme Court. The eco-sensitive area is applicable only to places around wildlife sanctuaries. Government is ready to convene a meeting of MLAs to clear doubts and allay fears on the formulation of eco-sensitive areas,” K Raju said. tnn

Randeep Surjewala

New Delhi: Congress functionary Randeep Singh Surjewala on Thursday said Congress may “spring a surprise” in the capital, just like it did in the elections in Haryana last year.

While other political parties have dismissed Congress from the contest, Surjewala, while addressing a press conference, said the results would be surprising for everyone. “Some news channels were giving us just two seats in Haryana, but we won 31. It is going to happen again,” he said.

Congress had failed to win a single seat in the 2015 assembly elections, while it managed eight in 2013. The party, however, did reasonably-well in terms of vote-share in the 2019 Lok Sabha polls by bagging over 22% of total votes polled.

Accusing Aam Aadmi Party-led Delhi government and BJP-led central government of failing in areas of health, pollution mitigation, education, clean drinking water supply and public transport in the capital, the AICC media in-charge said only Congress was capable of providing good governance.

“AAP wants dangal (confrontations) wali Delhi and the BJP wants dangon (riots) wali Delhi,” Surjewala claimed, while stressing that Congress wants “dil walon ki Dilli”.

Reacting to BJP’s blitzkrieg campaign that saw an army of workers and functionaries campaign in Delhi for 15 days, Surjewala said senior functionaries of the saffron party had “panicked” as they felt this time BJP may not win even three seats that it had won in the 2015 polls.

He alleged that BJP and AAP tried to hide their failure and distract people’s attention from issues of development in the city by raising the noise of “hatred and abusive language”.

CHENNAI: The Airports Authority of India’s (AAI) plan to speed up security check by installing an automatic tray retrieval system at Chennai airport’s domestic and international terminals by February or March is set to be delayed because of the spread of coronavirus in China.A Chinese company was selected to supply six conveyor machines that will remove and bring back trays used by passengers to place electronic items and wallets for scanning at security check and two machines have been installed at two security check counters at the domestic terminal as a pilot project, but AAI officials now feel the rest may not arrive before the deadline of March.An official said that one of the machines, put up under the pilot project, is helping speed up security screening that used to be delayed. The queues became lengthier as the CISF personnel on duty took time to bring back the empty trays. Under the new check rules, which mandate wallets and belts being placed in plastic trays in addition to electronic items, almost every passenger has to use a tray.Sources said the decision to install more machines was made after a study showed that passengers cleared the check-in process fast, but were getting stuck at slow security check counters. This gave them very little time to spend at retail shops, including food outlets, in the security hold area. The new machines help CISF personnel scan 800-900 cabin bags an hour compared to the 400 bags per hour that are cleared by scanners that do not have the automatic system.“The number of pieces of cabin baggage screened is high at the domestic terminal and passengers often reach the check-in counter an hour before departure. We found that most of these passengers get stuck at security check and in most cases hardly spend any time in the security hold area where retail and food outlets are located. This is going against the concept of airport retail by which passengers are supposed to spend time shopping before boarding flights,” said an official.",chennai,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73975089,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-406774,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/plan-to-speed-up-security-check-at-city-airport-hit/articleshow/73970778.cms
445,['6/02/2020'],Semester system to resume in Madhya Pradesh from next session,"This story is from February 6, 2020

BHOPAL: Semesters will be back in Madhya Pradesh from the next academic session.

Higher education minister Jitu Patwari confirmed this to TOI on Wednesday, and said: “The previous BJP governments’ scrapping of semester system was against students’ welfare. We will resume it.”

The BJP administration had taken the state back in time in 2016 when it did away with semesters and brought back annual pattern of exam in colleges. Majority of academics had criticised the government then, pointing out that semesters were the norm, worldwide .

Talking to TOI, Patwari said, “Semester system is in vogue across the world. Ending it was against students’ interest and pushed them behind at the national and international level.”

Unlike the previous government, he is not in a rush to end the annual pattern, he said. “We will resume semester system gradually. The earlier government scrapped semester in one go, which put students in trouble. A draft has been prepared and we are studying ways of resuming semester system without undue hassle to students., The transition must be smooth.”

NSUI spokesperson Vivek Tripathi said the erstwhile BJP government’s decision to end semester system put students at a disadvantage. “It created an adverse impact on students as they have become casual towards attending classes, thinking that the examination will be held after a year. This is not good,” said Tripathi.

After the Congress government came to power, NSUI spoke to students in this regard, he said. “We have involved students, teachers and educationists to take their views on ending the annual pattern,” said Tripathi, adding that the semester system should be resumed gradually. “It is obvious that ending anything in one go left several voices unheard. To avoid such a situation, it will resume in phases,” said Tripathi.

TRICHY: Around 350 guest lecturers working in 10 constituent colleges under Bharathidasan University (BDU) may have their salaries revised soon.

BDU vice-chancellor P Manisankar has assured a delegation of association of university teachers (AUT) on Monday that they would seek finance committee approval to raise the salaries of these ad hoc teachers working in 10 of its constituent colleges.

There are three types of teachers working on ad hoc basis apart from regular faculty members in the constituent colleges.

This includes guest faculty members on consolidated pay, teachers paid on hourly basis and teachers hired under parent teacher association (PTA).

While there aren’t any PTA teachers from this year, there are about 350 guest faculty members and 230 hourly-basis teachers.

As per UGC directive, institutions must not have more than 20% ad hoc teaching staff.

However, 80% of staff in these 10 constituent colleges are ad hoc. Four of these colleges were recently converted into government colleges. But salaries of guest faculty members are still paid by the university. They are paid a meagre Rs 10,000-13,000, while many of them are working for more than a decade now.

In 2011, UGC had fixed the pay scale for guest faculty members at Rs 25,000. While most of the institutions including BDU ignored it, qualified ad hoc teachers were asked to be paid Rs 50,000 as per Seventh Pay Commission last year.

State universities like Alagappa and Madurai Kamaraj have passed resolutions in their syndicate to pay Rs 25,000 for their ad hoc teachers, but BDU was silent so far on the salary front.

General secretary of AUT, M S Balamurugan said that Manisankar was positive and assured to give a decent hike for the guest faculty.

“We have asked the VC to consider further hike for those working from as early as 2006 for a maximum of Rs 13,000 per month,” he said.

Intellectual exploitation of hourly basis staff is further intense, who had tough time getting even experience certificate to apply for the direct recruitment of assistant professors in government arts colleges recently.

The vice-chancellor has assured to change the nomenclature of hourly basis teachers to guest faculty members.

This would help them apply for regular positions in colleges and universities, he said.

Dignitaries at the panel discussion

Nagpur: Innovation and creativity have reached dizzy heights after citizens have become aware and responsible towards the decaying condition of the globe.

At a programme held at the Rajiv Gandhi National Institute for Intellectual Property Management (RGNIIPM) on Wednesday, ‘Ready to innovate worldwide forum’ came up with many methods to reduce the operating cost of the cities. Experts from various sectors, including the environment,

shared their solutions for the numerous problems and the best part was the participation of citizens in the dialogue which was healthy and constructive.

Rajendra Ladhkar talked about patented projects that are in use to make a city better and smarter. In his presentation, Ladhkar listed methods like upgraded road dividers which can detect and trap a terrorist vehicle. The device can also be used to divert traffic. It is cost effective and durable.

A hanging road divider was another tool suggested to bring down the operational cost of cities. The device will help in reducing road accidents which mostly occur due to unseen dividers. With this device, the divider will be easily seen, said the expert, who impressed the audience with his unique innovations.

Dnyaneshwar Kamble, co-founder of ‘Ready to Innovate Worldwide’, conducted the panel discussion. He welcomed the four panellists — Vishakha Rao, expert in market research, JS Pandey, an expert in climate change from NEERI, Dr Amol Deshmukh, founder of HERD Organic Farms and Pooja Maulikar, an examiner of patent and design.

When Rao was asked to define a ‘smart city’, she said, “When we talk about smart city, it doesn’t mean digitalization only. It also signifies a citizen’s role, like how he responds to a project of change.”

On the other questions like how can citizens ensure what they want and what can be done, Deshmukh and Maulikar said, “Maharashtra is turning into a state with the highest number of patents and only the ones concerned should be well educated on the subject.”

Regarding air pollution and the role citizens can play to check the menace, Pandey said, “Citizens must know the issue in depth and must stop falling prey to environmental problems. The environment and the ecosystem work like a human body in which the temperature rises with the probability of something wrong likely to happen. It is therefore mandatory to fear the rising change.”

The programme concluded with a ceremony in which awards were presented to eight individuals for their innovation and creativity.

Dr Ajay Gondane, a former high commissioner of India to Australia, was the chief guest, while Ravindra Thakre, collector, Nagpur district, was the guest of honour. Mayor Sandip Joshi and Mayor of Karlsruhe (Germany) Dr Frank Mentrup were also present.

CHENNAI: Doctors’ bodies, including the Indian Medical Association and other organisations, said they have not received clear instructions from the government on the protocol to be followed if any of the passengers on home quarantine come to them with symptoms of novel coronavirus At least five private hospitals in the city said they have no information on how or when they should notify the government. So far, the Indian Medical Association has not received any information from the health department, said IMA state president Dr C N Raja.“Most doctors know how to medically handle such cases since clear protocols are listed out by organisations like World Health Organization. We are planning to meet health officials for more information on state protocol,” he said. The most common questions the association has been facing from doctors are — ‘Do we notify them when we have patients with symptoms or after they test positive? How should we send samples for tests? Can we continue to treat patients if tests confirm the viral infection?’Senior infectious diseases doctors said treatment for the virus is not clear yet. Morbidity is higher in patients with extremes of age, uncontrolled diabetes or blood sugar and among patients with other co-morbid infection.“But the viral infection has been declared as a pandemic. Kerala has declared it as an emergency. If the public health department is using its powers to restrict treatment at government hospitals we cannot violate it,” he said.Director of public health K Kolandaisamy said the state did not have any objection on patients getting admitted in private hospitals as long as they have adequate quarantine facilities and are equipped to handle infectious diseases. “We have not sent any instructions because we have not made any restrictions,” he said. The aim now is to prevent the virus within the state, he said. “Adequate precautions are being taken to prevent the spread of the disease within the state. We are keeping passengers in quarantine only to prevent transmission of the virus from one person to another. We expect medical teams to do the same,” he said.

BHOPAL: Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) chief Mohan Bhagwat urged youth to encourage people to spread awareness on social equality and united family.

Addressing Vibhag Pracharaks (publicity in-charges) on Wednesday, Bhagwat said, ""There is a need to spread the message of social equality and help eliminate caste-based inequalities. Sangh members should develop the organisation like a family and make efforts for ensuring social equality and harmony by instilling feeling of affection and affinity in the society,"" Bhagwat said.

According to regional publicity in-charge (Madhya Bharat region) Om Prakash Sisodia , the RSS chief also reviewed the activities undertaken by the regional bodies during the last one year and discussed plan to promote social harmony in the society. Bhagwat also talked about involving women from various social and cultural organisations to create awareness on developing an ideal family system through active participation of couples.

""What is an ideal Hindu family? How much time family members should spare for each other and how to establish family values are some of the issues that workers should discuss and share their thoughts with the families they contact. This would encourage families to participate in seminars and discussions on family values,"" the RSS chief said.

Bhagwat is on a four-day tour to the state capital for holding discussions with pracharaks from MP and Chhattisgarh. He reportedly emphasised on strengthening the saffron base in rural areas through dedicated volunteers and also to create awareness on CAA and Article 370 among public.

453,['6/02/2020'],"Odisha gets Rs 4,373 crore in rail budget","This story is from February 6, 2020

Bhubaneswar: The Centre has reduced Odisha’s rail budget allocation by nearly Rs 1620 crore. Against last year’s budget of Rs 5,993 crore, the state has been allocated Rs 4,373 crore this time, revealed the data shared by East Coast Railway (ECoR) here on Wednesday. The Naveen Patnaik government had asked for around Rs 6,000 crore for the development of railways in the state.

Ever since the Narendra Modi government came to power in 2014, the state has witnessed a steady rise in its rail budget allocation. From Rs 3,712 crore in 2015-16, it grew to Rs 4,682 crore in 2016-17, Rs 5,102 crore in 2017-18 and Rs 5,252 in 2018-19. But this fiscal’s allocation is lower than that of 2016-17.

“Last year, National Thermal Power Corporation (NTPC) had invested Rs 1400 crore in the Jharsuguda-Barapali coal corridor project. It had increased Odisha’s budgetary allocation to Rs 5,993 crore,” the ECoR stated.

A senior railway official, though, said the allocation will not affect ongoing projects. “All major projects have got significant increase in allotment. We are ready to complete one of the oldest projects — the 82-km-long Haridaspur-Paradip new line — this year,” the official said.

One of the important pending projects — the Khurda Road-Balangir (289 km) new line — got Rs 520 crore as against last year’s Rs 350 crore. The project, conceived in 1995, will connect western Odisha with the coastal part of the state. Only 92 km of the total project has been commissioned so far.

Another project — the 98.7km new line between Angul and Sukinda Road — has received budget grant of Rs 450 crore against last year’s Rs 250 crore.

Another recent project, the Jeypore-Nabarangpur (38 km) new line, got Rs 20 crore allocation against last year’s Rs 10 crore. But the Talcher-Bimalagarh (154 km) new line got Rs 10 crore less than last year’s Rs 150 crore. Similarly, the Jeypore-Malkangiri (130km) new line got Rs 33 crore against last year’s Rs 70 crore.

There is significant increase in allotment towards doubling work, especially Sambalpur-Talcher, Sambalpur-Titilagarh, Titilagarh-Rayagada and Titilagarh-Raipur. Indian Railways has given priority for electrification work of Khurda Road-Balangir and Lanjigarh Road-Junagarh Road rail line, said a railway source.

A new project — the Sambalpur-Gopalpur new line — has been sanctioned this year with a token amount of Rs 1 lakh. Wagon repair workshop at Maneswar in Sambalpur received allocation of Rs 20 crore.

Barring this new line, the Centre has not sanctioned any other new lines. The state had asked for new lines between Puri and Konark, Jajpur-Dhamra and Bargarh-Nuapada and rail lines in Mayurbhanj.

Bhubaneswar: The Centre has sanctioned the Sambalpur-Gopalpur new line in this year’s rail budget. A token amount of Rs 1 lakh has been sanctioned for this 241-km-long project.

East Coast Railway (ECoR) sources said the project has been sanctioned at a cost of Rs 2957 crore subject to final approval of Niti Aayog. “The project will start after it gets Niti Aayog approval,” said a senior railway official.

This new line via Phulbani in Kandhamal district will connect western Odisha with southern Odisha. After completion of the project, industries in Sambalpur will be able to use Gopalpur port in Ganjam district.

Sambalpur BJP MLA Jayanarayan Mishra welcomed the decision and said the new line will benefit the people of Odisha. “The project will connect an industrial area with the port town. This is a good step taken by the Centre,” Mishra said.

Chatrapur BJD MLA Subash Chandra Behera said the state government is planning to make industrial development in Chatrapur and the new project will help in this endeavour. “Hope the project gets approval from Niti Aayog. The railways should start the project without delay,” he added.

However, Koraput Congress MP Saptagiri Ulaka raised question mark about the railway’s intention to take up new projects in the state. “We had similar declarations in the 2017-18 Budget for Gunupur-Therubali rail line, but since then the railways has backed out citing poor rate of return. It may happen to this project as well,” Ulaka cautioned.

Some other projects also got token amount. Naupada-Gunupur extension up to Theruvali (79.4 km) and Talcher-Angul new line with Y-connection at Talcher (14.5km) got Rs 1 lakh each in this Budget. Setting up of an electric engine overhauling workshop at Kalahandi got Rs 1 crore token money. Similarly, the Angul electric loco shed augmentation project received Rs 4 crore.

To enhance safety, elimination of level crossings by constructing of road over bridges (ROBs) and road under bridges (RUBs) have been given top priority and projects worth Rs 1165 crore have been sanctioned in this regard, said an ECoR source.

NEW DELHI: Critical of the delay in the Nirbhaya case , Delhi high court on Wednesday said “authorities concerned were sleeping” after the Supreme Court confirmed death sentence of the four convicts in May 2017.

“I have no hesitation in saying that after dismissal of the special leave petition (SLP) by the Supreme Court in May 2017, nobody took steps for issuance of death warrants for their execution,” Justice Suresh Kait observed.

Listing how each of the convicts adopted “delay tactics” the high court noted that Mukesh Singh filed a review against the apex court’s dismissal of his appeal after a lapse of 186 days, while Vinay Sharma and Pawan Gupta moved a similar plea after a lapse of 225 days. Fourth accused Akshay Thakur took the most time, seeking review plea after a delay of 950 days.

It said even after the reviews were dismissed by SC the state’s authorities “waited for reasons best known to them” till December 2019, to approach trial court and seek a black warrant.

The Delhi government had moved the court for death warrants nearly two years after SC had dismissed the appeals against confirmation of death penalty. Before the government and Tihar Jail administration acted, Nirbhaya’s family moved the trial court in February 2019, seeking a date of hanging to be fixed. The high court also pointed out that Singh and Sharma filed curative plea after a gap of 550 and 549 days, respectively, from the date of dismissal of their review pleas.

On Wednesday, high court also plugged a loophole in Delhi jail rules, making it clear that Tihar and other jail authorities in the capital can now move to execute death warrants as soon as a death row convict loses the criminal appeal before the apex court, instead of waiting till review or mercy plea is filed.

Removing the confusion created by 2018 revised Delhi Prison Rules that led to crippling delay, the court interpreted these to hold that the bar on separate hangings exists only till the time appeals in Supreme Court are pending.

Porvorim MLA Rohan Khaunte

PANAJI: BJP spokesperson Premanand Mahambre on Wednesday filed a complaint with the assembly speaker and Porvorim police alleging that he was heckled by Porvorim MLA Rohan Khaunte in the assembly complex for addressing a press conference earlier in the day against the Independent MLA.

Addressing a hurriedly-called press conference late evening, BJP state president Sadanand Shet Tanavade demanded necessary action against Khaunte.

Mahambre, who had addressed a press conference earlier in the day making allegations against Khaunte, said that the Independent MLA, on seeing him in the corridors of the assembly complex after the day’s proceedings were over, got into an altercation with him. “I went and briefed the chief minister who advised me to file a complaint,” Mahambre said.

Mahambre said at a press conference he had tried to “expose the double standards of Khaunte” who has been active in the opposition during the ongoing budget session.

Tanavade said party workers in the Porvorim constituency were at the receiving end when Khaunte was minister for revenue and IT. He indicated that the party couldn’t do much in the past as it didn’t have the numbers and was dependent on allies to run the government.

While Tanavade said Khaunte is frustrated as he is out of power, the Porvorim MLA said BJP is frustrated as he and other opposition members had exposed the BJP government on various issues, including the mismanagement of the state’s finances. “These are the old tactics of the BJP to level false allegations against opponents and to pressurise them into silence,” Khaunte said

459,['6/02/2020'],"Kochi: District authorities bank on residents, eye better ranking","This story is from February 6, 2020

KOCHI: With the ministry of housing and urban affairs (MoHUA) announcing its next edition of the Ease of Living Index (EoLI) by incorporating a citizen perception survey to rank 114 cities in the country, district administration along with the Cochin Smart City Mission Ltd (CSML) and Kochi corporation have appealed to the citizens to participate in the survey and give good ranking to the city.

District collector S Suhas on Wednesday sent out a public appeal asking people to participate in the citizen survey to rank the city. CSML managing director Alkesh Kumar Sharma said: “Kochi city is way ahead of many others in the country in most of the parameters that are being assessed in the survey. I hope that the residents of the city will participate in large numbers so that we get the ranking we deserve.”

EoLI is an initiative of the urban affairs ministry to help cities assess their livability in relation to global and national benchmarks and encourage cities to move towards an ‘outcome-based’ approach to urban planning and management. The ministry launched the citizen perception survey on Saturday and the window for rating the cities will be active till February 29. The survey aims to record perception of residents on 49 parameters such as governance, health, cleanliness, water supply, safety and security, economic opportunities, availability of affordable housing, power supply, transportation, recreation, environment, public service and lifestyle. The 49 indicators will later be captured through 97 data points. Based on these indices, the cities will be ranked.

In 2018, the survey was based on the reports submitted by the local bodies and there were a lot of objections to the methodology. In that year, when scaled along with 111 cities in the country on its livability index, Kochi city stood at the 45th position while Thiruvananthapuram was ranked 71.

However, there is also a growing opinion that Kochi city should not take such surveys beyond it’s face value. “I think we should not get trapped into this ranking business as cities are not comparable for historical, social and administrative reasons. These rankings give some insights but should not be used to compare cities,” said centre for public policy research chairman D Dhanuraj.

“The ground rule is that ranking is not going to make any impact on funding agencies. When international agencies come in, ranking won’t help. Ground realities do,” he said.

“We are far ahead in terms of education, health, governance and several other parameters when compared to most of the cities. Last time, there was some confusion on methodologies but this time it is going to be even tough because Malayalis have a habit of measuring our standards with the West,” said Rajan Chedambath, director, centre for heritage, environment and development (c-hed), an institution under Kochi corporation.

MUMBAI: A sessions court on Wednesday rejected the anticipatory bail plea of a 22-yearold student of Tata Institute of Social Sciences (TISS) booked for sedition. Urvashi Chudawala was booked for raising slogans in support of JNU student Sharjeel Imam , arrested for sedition, at the LGBTQ Pride March at Azad Maidan onSaturday.

Rejecting the plea, judge Prashant P Rajvaidya said: “Even though this court is not dealing with the matters of crime allegedly committed by Sharjeel Imam, ultimately the intent of the statement uttered by the applicant (Chudawala) in supporting Sharjeel Imam, in my opin ion, prima facie, attracts the ingredients of Section 124A (sedition) of Indian Penal Code which attracts life imprisonment. Hence, the offence is serious in nature.”

Opposing the student’s plea, chief public prosecutor Jaisingh Desai said Sharjeel’s statements were against the country, he is an enemy of the country and Urvashi had supported such a person.

The slogan raised by the accused showed that the student wanted to get together and fulfil Sharjeel’s dreams as he is in custody. He added that before registering the FIR, cops had repeatedly called the student but she didn’t cooperate. Defence advocate Vijay Hiremath submitted that for sedition, there should be a call for violence.

“Was the line, said only once for two seconds as shown by the video, do any harm? It does not create any hatred towards the government, any community or individuals. It was in the intensity of the continuous sloganeering for 10 minutes. One line was said, and it was only against his arrest,” he said, adding that Chudawala was not connected to Imam. But the court said the material prima facie supported allegations that on her Facebook account, Chudawala had liked a photo of Sharjeel, where it was mentioned, ‘Release Sharjeel Unconditionally”.

NEW DELHI: Responding to an appeal by the Jamia Millia Islamia administration , the joint coordination committee has decided to stop protesting near gate number 7 for two days in view of elections. This is being done to ensure that voters do not face any problems in entering and exiting the polling station, said a member, adding that they will cooperate fully in the free and fair conduct of the elections.

However, the protesters will return to gate number 7 on February 9, a day after the polls, the member clarified.

Jamia Millia Islamia administration had on Wednesday issued an appeal to the students to stop protesting near gate number 7 in view of security concerns and elections. A day before, Delhi Police had written to the university authorities to ask students to stay away from the protest and vacate the stretch near gate number 7. Upender Singh, SHO, Jamia Nagar, had written the letter to the varsity registrar stating that the law and order situation in Jamia Nagar area was very critical.

“Some students, old students and localites are sitting at Okhla road outside the gate number 7 of the university, protesting against CAA and NRC. The road from Holy Family hospital to Jamia Millia metro station has been blocked. In past, firing incidents occurred in the area of New Friends Colony and Shaheen Bagh. A case of attempt to murder and arms act has been registered as well,” the letter added.

“In view of the Delhi elections on Saturday and to avoid any untoward situation, you are requested to remove the protesters from the road,” the letter urged the registrar.

In its appeal to the students, the varsity administration stated that the dharna was happening on Maulana Mohammad Ali Jauhar Marg and that the “university was responsible for the safety and security of its students within the domain of the campus and could protect the students and staff when they as a group are independent of the crowd which was not a bona fide part of the university.”

The administration requested students not to be a part of an agitating crowd on a public road. “The parents were being approached and their support in personal capacity was also solicited to guide their wards in adhering to basic precautions,” it stated.

Representative image

GANDHINAGAR: A liquor permit scam, involving the sale of liquor from a licenced shop in the Mundra Special Economic Zone (SEZ), has rocked the state prohibition department. Senior officers have been issued show-cause notices, after it was found that the liquor shop owner not only sold liquor to persons outside the SEZ, he also evaded VAT on liquor sold to persons outside the SEZ.

The Gujarat home department has cancelled the liquor sale license of M/s Planet F&B, one of the biggest liquor shops in Mundra SEZ, which was found to be involved in large-scale irregularities.

A senior government official said that according to the SEZ Act, liquor shops can sell alcohol within the SEZ without any tax liability. “Selling any kind of liquor outside the SEZ without a licence is illegal. It was found that M/s Planet F&B sold more than 46,000 bottles of liquor without due process and without paying tax to the government,” the official stated.

The role of senior officials of the prohibition department in this scam is also being investigated. The official said, “A departmental inquiry has been initiated against senior officials of the prohibition department, who are alleged to have allowed the illegalities. The unauthorised sale outside the SEZ amounts to a lapse on the part of the officers.”

He added that the licence of M/s Planet F&B, granted in 2015, has been revoked and legal action has been initiated against the company.

Officials said M/s Planet F&B also caused a loss of Rs 54 lakh to the exchequer by not paying supervisory fees, which was fixed at Rs 1.50 lakh per month. “Liquor shop permits are normally granted to posh hotels, but as a special case, this agency was granted the licence based on an assurance of paying supervisory fees of Rs 1.50 lakh per month. However, in connivance with local department officials, the licensee did not pay Rs 54 lakh in supervisory fees,” the official added.

M/s Planet F&B had been granted a licence to sell liquor only in one of the four segments of the SEZ, but investigations revealed that it had been selling liquor in other segments too.

Vijayawada: Chief minister YS Jaganmohan Reddy on Wednesday reiterated that the state has saved Rs 2,000 crore through reverse tendering and clarified that the tenders of the previous government were cancelled due to irregularities.

Speaking at an education conclave, the chief minister once again sought to allay the fears of investors by justifying the reverse tendering as a profitable exercise. “In Polavaram alone we have saved Rs 830 crore. To put it simply, the same work was done for Rs 830 crore less than what was agreed to under the previous regime. In the TIDCO housing scheme, we could save Rs 400 crore,” Jaganmohan Reddy explained.

He also expressed confidence that the reverse tendering would help bring down cost and infuse competitive spirit among bidders. Replying to a question during the conclave, Jaganmohan Reddy spoke about judicial preview and announced that it will scrutinise the the tenders above Rs 100 crore and put them in the public domain for suggestions. “Once the bids are closed, only the amount of the lowest bidder would be on the website and if anyone quotes a lesser price it will be considered. It is a part of the initiative to provide transparent and corruption-free governance,” Jaganmohan Reddy added.

Meanwhile, during a review meeting on Wednesday, the chief minister revealed his future plans for village and ward secretariats and said that a standard operating procedure would be put in place to ensure that welfare programmes reach the people. He said a process has to be maintained by the secretarial staff and volunteers while implementing the new welfare programmes. The chief minister directed officials to maintain an attendance register for the volunteers.

He said since each volunteer was entrusted with 50 houses, there should not be any scope for delays in implementation of any scheme. As the system was introduced to take administration to the doorsteps of the people, there should be no scope for corruption, he said, adding that monthly review of the secretariates’ performance can help.

Thiruvananthapuram: If Muthoot Finance management continues to stick to its defiant attitude towards conciliatory talks aimed at settling the ‘serious labour issues ’ in the company, the government would explore all available legal options to rein in the private finance institution, labour affairs minister T P Ramakrishnan told the assembly here on Wednesday.

Answering to a submission by M Swaraj in the assembly, the labour affairs minister said the Muthoot Finance management’s refusal to stick to the tri-partite agreement, reached on the basis of the recommendations of Kerala high court, was the reason for the current spate of labour agitation.

“Following a complaint of non-banking and private finance association (CITU) against the management’s attempts to retrench a number of employees and close down branches, contrary to an agreement reached with the employees’ association, the labour commissioner invited both parties for talks. But the management said it was not ready to roll back the decisions of retrenchment of staff and closure of branches. Following this, a meeting chaired by the labour affairs minister came to a conclusion that the management has violated the agreement. Muthoot Finance managing director was also asked to show reasons for the violation of agreement. In view of the ongoing strike, subject to the orders of the high court, labour commissioner held further meetings on January 14, 20 and 29. The meeting held in the presence of the high court nominee on January 29 asked the management to take back the retrenched employees. The company management is yet to respond,” the minister said.

469,['6/02/2020'],Odisha government plans six more projects worth Rs 900 crore for Puri,"This story is from February 6, 2020

Odisha CM Naveen Patnaik

Bhubaneswar: The state government has planned six more projects worth around Rs 900 crore for Puri under the ABADHA scheme as part of its efforts to transform it into a world-class heritage city.

Earlier, the state government had already approved 15 projects worth Rs 2,300 crore under the Augmentation Basic Amenities and Development of Heritage and Architecture (ABADHA) scheme, named after the temple Mahaprasad.

The government had already made an allocation of Rs 730 crore for them in the supplementary budget in November.

“The six new projects are apart from several other projects sanctioned earlier, including the heritage corridor project around the Puri Jagannath Temple . The official announcement of the new projects would be made soon,” said a senior government official.

The new projects include, among others, a street façade improvement project that has been planned to give a heritage look to the structures on the Badadanda (Grand Road). Around 250 crore will be spent on it.

Earlier, the housing and urban development department had asked house owners, mutt authorities, dharmasalas, hotels and commercial establishments to apply a uniform colour on the buildings along the Grand Road.

The state government has also decided to develop the pleasure garden of the Lord located at the Jagannath Ballav Mutt with an investment of Rs 80 crore. According to the Jagannath Temple administration, the mutt supplies flower-ornaments like tilak and jhumpa for Baddasinghara Besha of the Lord.

As the temple city has several spots of heritage significance, the state government has decided to develop the heritage paths with better road connectivity and develop other basic infrastructure. Under the ABADHA project, around Rs 360 crore will be spent on this project.

The sea beach in Puri would soon become a centre of attraction for people visiting the pilgrim town. Plans are afoot to develop the beach front from the Banki Muhan till the Sterling Resorts. “A master plan is being prepared for the beach front development with focus on beautification, greenery, strengthening roads and developing public amenities,” the official said.

Development of resort, wellness centre, exhibition space-cum-interpretation centre, public park, illumination, parking space and handlooms and handicrafts centre will be covered under the beach road development plan. The state government plans to spend around Rs 180 crore on it.

The development of Gundicha temple, believed to be the birthplace of Lord Jagannath, Lord Balabhadra and Devi Subhadra, is also part of the ABADHA project. Around Rs 5 crore will be spent for the purpose.

Similarly, a Gurukul project with an investment of Rs 25 crore will also be taken up under ABADHA scheme to groom young servitors.

The ABADHA projects will be implemented over a period of three years from 2019-20 to 2021-22. Significant allocation is expected for these projects in the forthcoming state budget for 2020-21 fiscal year, the official said.

474,['6/02/2020'],Amended marine fisheries regulation Act in the offing,"This story is from February 6, 2020

Visakhapatnam: The state government is planning to amend the AP Marine Fisheries Regulation Act (MFRA) of 1995, which has become obsolete. The upgraded MFRA, which will take the recommendations of scientists from Central Marine Fisheries Research Institute (CMFRI) and Central Marine Fisheries Technology (CIFT), will focus on sustainable and eco-friendly fishing techniques.

The new regulations will also focus on regulating uncontrolled fishing, species diversification, cutting down on optimal fleet size, limiting craft and mesh size, conversion of trawlers to tuna liners, prohibition on catch of endangered and protected species, improved surveillance and vessel monitoring system etc. After decades of research, a group of scientists from CMFRI have compiled a study — ‘Policy Guidance on Sustaining Marine Fisheries of Andhra Pradesh’ — based on which recommendations have been made to the state government to amend the MFRA on those lines.

Subhadeep Ghosh, principal scientist in-charge at CMFRI who is among the authors of the study along with Muktha Menon, A Gopalakrishnan and others, feels the existing MFRA is poorly implemented and monitored. “We have suggested a separate enforcement wing for the state fisheries department besides marine fisheries surveillance units when the Act is updated. There is also a need to regulate uncontrolled fishing efforts such as an optimal fleet size of 1,300 mechanized fishing boats. The state presently has around 1,600 such boats and the fishing capacity is nearly 62% in excess,” he said.

“Boats over 15 years of age should be replaced, engine power should be reduced to below 300 horsepower, and high-powered crafts should be restricted from trawl fishing and diverted to deep sea long-lining and gillnetting. Conversion of shrimp trawlers to tuna liners has already been advocated in the state,” Ghosh added.

CMFRI scientists have also recommended regulating mesh size in the trawl cod ends to reduce juvenile fish from getting caught and advocated wide use of by-catch reduction devices. Other recommendations include restricting the number of ring seines (nets), strict enforcement of 60-day fishing ban, creating a reserved zone for traditional fishers up to eight kilometres from the shore to prevent indiscriminate exploitation of brooders and juvenile fish. The also want minimum legal size (MLS) of fish landed or caught to be implemented as a control measure, which will enable most fish to spawn at least once before being caught.

JODHPUR: The Rajasthan high court has given big relief to the taxpayers to file GSTR 9 and 9C without late fees and has directed the Centre to file a detailed reply by February 12 about its preparedness and GSTN filing capacity of the server.

The court has also directed the Centre to accept GSTR 9 and GSTR 9C returns without charging any late fees till February 12.

The Tax Bar Association , Jodhpur , had moved the high court through a PIL with regard to the technical glitches being faced by taxpayers in filing GSTR 9/9C on the GSTN portal, which rendered the extended time for filing returns useless.

Arguing in the court, petitioner’s counsel Rahul Lakhwani stated that repeated attempts by taxpayers to file tax returns on the portal during the extended period failed time and again. The petitioner submitted screenshots of these failed attempts and argued that the GSTN portal was not having requisite capacity to handle the filing of pending returns within the deadline.

The counsel informed the court regarding new ways of extension of date by CBIC through its twitter handle.

“Even according to data submitted by the counsel of Centre, the portal at its best day accepted about 20 lakh returns whereas about 30 lakh returns had been pending at 1.30 pm on February 5,” Lakhwani said.

Keeping the arguments on the dismal server capacity of GSTN, the division bench of Chief Justice Indrajit Mahanty and Justice Pushpendra Singh Bhati directed the Centre to file a detailed reply by February 12 about its preparedness and GSTN capacity of the server.

BENGALURU: The high court on Wednesday cancelled the bail granted to self-proclaimed godman Nithyananda in 2010 in connection with a rape case .

Justice John Michael Cunha also directed the trial court in Ramanagara to take Nithyananda to custody and take further steps on his bail bonds.

“There is overwhelming material to show that Nithyananda, accused no 1 in the case, has misused the liberty granted to him and has run away from India to a foreign country to escape trial. His whereabouts are also not known either to the prosecution or to the persons close to him,” the judge observed while allowing the petition filed by K Lenin, the complainant in the case,

The judge also opined that Nithyananda had misled the court to believe that he was engaged in propagation of Hindu religion.

Justice Cunha did not appreciate the stand taken by the CID that Nithyananda was not found at his Bidadi ashram and one of his aides told them that the godman was on a “spiritual tour”. He also did not appreciate the submission of the special public prosecutor that there was no need of Nityananada at this stage of trial.

In his petition, Lenin had sought the cancellation of Nithyananda’s bail, stating that the latter was not appearing before the trial court though orders for his appearance were passed in November as well as December 2019.

Lenin contended that the godman had left the country though his passport expired on September 30, 2018 and that he was traveling on a Brazilian passport. He said the CID, the investigating agency, has not taken any steps to secure Nithyananda.

Siddharth Varadarajan addresses the audience

Nagpur: “We have neglected the psychological aspect of politics. People who are in power have moulded the mentality of citizens in such a manner that ‘bure din’ (bad days) are here. They have forgotten and are dismissing the agony Babasaheb Ambedkar went through in his struggle against inequality,” said senior journalist Ranjit Meshram at the 100th year anniversary of Ambedkar’s first newspaper, ‘Mooknayak’, organized by a city-based news channel.

Eminent personalities from the field of journalism, namely, co-founding editor of The Wire, Siddharth Varadarajan, editor of News Nation, Subhash Shirke and managing director of Awaaz India TV, Aman Kamble were present at the event held at Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar auditorium, Deekshabhoomi.

“Ambedkar was a selfless man who committed himself to the betterment of the society. In his fight against disparity, he had to overcome many obstacles,” added Meshram.

Varadarajan raised concerns over the current scenario in the media. “In today’s times, the commodification of media is evident in the society. Ambedkar was a journalist who strongly disagreed with sensationalism. Today, when you switch on news channels, you will see roaring debates with anchors instigating panellists to use harsh words. Such portals function more for entertainment purposes than to broadcast news,” he said.

Encouraging youngsters to step into the field of media fearlessly, he said, “This domain requires only one qualification and that is the passion to ask questions. If we stop asking questions, journalism along with democracy will submerge.”

Shirke rued the lack of representation of journalists from minority communities. He said, “We need voices and decision makers who can raise issues of minorities or ethnic groups that have been repressed. The dearth of Dalit representation in news channels is a cause for concern.”

Through a video clip, journalist Aarfa Sherwani shared her thoughts on various issues. “The big propaganda of the big media run by big money has failed due to the emergence of alternative media. The right to dissent in a democracy is being suppressed. This issue is being highlighted by alternative media portals,” she said.

In his introductory speech, Kamble said, “When Ambedkar came out with Mooknayak, casteism was prevalent in the society to such an extent that the newspaper Kesari refused to publish an announcement about such a revolutionary newspaper. In the current scenario, we can see similar circumstances. Today, journalism is totally in the hands of the government or industrialists.”

Thai national Wassana Promkasikorn with her two-day-old son at Charnock Hospital on Wednesday

KOLKATA: The city will play host to the 23-year-old Thai woman who gave birth to a boy 35,000 feet up in the air inside a Qatar Airways flight on Tuesday till at least February 12. While the woman, Wassana Promkasikorn, was hoping to fly back home on Wednesday, aviation norms prevent her from doing so till the newborn is at least eight days old. She also expressed her wish to get her son a Thai citizenship, as he was eligible for both Indian and Thai nationality.

The child was named — Thanakrit (meaning the one born in the sky) — by her aunt over a video call. Promkasikorn, had been admitted to Charnock Hospital on VIP Road after the flight made an emergency landing at Kolkata airport.

On Wednesday, a senior official from the Thai consulate came to meet Promkasikorn at the hospital and, after a detailed discussion, the official told hospital authorities that they were ready to take responsibility of the woman and would make arrangements to send her home. As Promkasikorn’s temporary landing permit granted from the immigration department at the airport on Tuesday will expire on Thursday, the consulate will arrange for it to be extended.

“The woman and the baby are doing well. We have issued a provisional birth certificate for the child and have handed it over to the Thai consulate who have agreed to take responsibility of the two. A consulate official told us that they would make arrangements to pay our bills and send the woman to Bangkok. However, she will remain with us till at least February 12,” a senior official of the hospital said.

TOI met Promkasikorn at the hospital on Wednesday. “This is my second visit to Kolkata. The last time I was here in 2018, I was partying with my aunt and friends at a South City apartment. But this visit will be etched in my memory forever,” Promkasikorn said.

“I am thankful to everyone for saving me and my child and taking such great care of us. However, I want Thanakrit to get a Thai citizenship,” she added.

A resident of Ubon Ratchathani in Bangkok, Promkasikorn said she had a fight with her boyfriend at Oman and, hence, had planned to return home to give birth to her child at her mother’s place. However, she didn’t inform anyone at the airport or airline officials about her pregnancy and had worn a long jacket hiding her bulging belly.

“I didn’t inform anyone about my condition while flying. However, when I was sitting at the plane, I felt the pain mid-air. Thanks to the caring attendants and a woman doctor on board, my baby was delivered safely,” said Promkasikorn, a single mother, who has an eight-year-old child from a previous affair.

“Friends have been texting me since morning. They sent me links of videos and news articles on me and my baby. It feels a little weird. But the one person I wanted to hear from is my boyfriend, the father of this child. I sent him Thanakrit’s photo, but am still awaiting a reply,” Wasana said, while checking WhatsApp messages on her cellphone.

New Delhi: The Special Investigation Team ( SIT ) interrogating JNU PhD scholar Sharjeel Imam for inciting violence during anti-CAA protests in Delhi is scanning some of his bank accounts that allegedly reflected some suspicious foreign remittances.

Even as Sharjeel, arrested on sedition charges, claimed that he had earned the money as remittances during his stay in a foreign country for higher studies, he is yet to confirm the source of the transactions. Sharjeel’s links to some political leaders in Bihar are also being probed. Sharjeel was produced before a magistrate on Thursday and was sent to judicial custody till February 12. Police may again seek his custody.

A source said that the Crime Branch questioned three Jamia students who were close to Sharjeel regarding the source of the funding. Police may also seize their phones and search their hostel rooms to recover more evidences regarding the source of funds.

The students, who were questioned for five hours, allegedly told the officers that they had distributed pamphlets at New Friends Colony and Jamia on December 13 and 14. A source said the three students had been identified as Sanaullah, Sidharth and Shahnawaz. They have named eight others associated with Sharjeel when he was preparing to launch the Shaheen Bagh protests. They will also be questioned.

It was found that Sharjeel had paid the money from this account to print 5,000 copies of three posters he had designed. These posters were distributed among people leaving mosques after Friday prayers and outside eateries in parts of Jamia and north-east Delhi.

It was reportedly found that the WhatsApp groups through which Sharjeel has been keeping in touch with his associates had been tampered with. Some of the conversations have been deleted before the phone was handed over to police, a source claimed. Cops are trying to retrieve these messages.

484,['6/02/2020'],Chennai Airport: Chennai’s second airport likely at Parandur,"The proposed airport will require about 4,500 acres including for future development.

CHENNAI: After years of scouring areas around the city for a second airport, the government is set to float global bids in a week for a consultant to do a detailed master plan for a site – likely to be Parandur near Sunguvarchatram. The selected consultant will, among other things, prepare a financial model and recommend development model under a public-private-partnership (PPP) framework, sources said.The proposed airport will require about 4,500 acres including for future development. “In an attempt to speed up the process of finalizing the plan, senior bureaucrats had a meeting with chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswami a few days ago. The Tamil Nadu Industrial Development Corporation Limited (Tidco) will float a Request for Proposal to zero in on a consultant,” said a source. The selected firm is expected to conduct a techno-economic feasibility study and prepare a project report, assist the government in obtaining statutory clearances and conduct bid process for selection of the developer.The government is expected to make known, by March or April, the location of the site alongside the identification of the consultant. Incidentally, Tidco had dumped its previous bid in July last year after extending the tender call thrice, since it faced a series of issues beginning with prospective consultants demanding that the government identify the site first. This was reflected in a pre-bid meeting the agency had convened to get the project going. Later, Tidco roped in a retired Airports Authority of India (AAI) official to help identify the site, given that the proximity of the Tambaram and Arakkonam air force stations could pose problems. The AAI authorities visited recently the proposed site at Parandur as well as at Mamandur near Cheyyar Sipcot industrial park, suggested by the state government. The Vision 2023 plan of former chief minister J Jayalalithaa had spelt out development of a greenfield airport in Sriperumbudur on a PPP basis.Once the site is officially identified, Sipcot will freeze the land. “After confirmation from the government and AAI is received, Sipcot will take up the further proceedings. There is no problem as of now, given that very few families live around the Parandur site,” said another official.The state has international airports at Chennai, Coimbatore, Trichy and Madurai and domestic airports at Tuticorin and Salem. Chennai remains one of the four busiest airports in the country, with 20.36 million passengers recorded in 2017-18. It also constituted 6.7% share in the country’s total aircraft movement during the year. The rise in demand prompted the state government to look out for sites for a second airport and sites such as Manallur near Gummidipoondi and Thiruporur were considered as possible locations.",chennai,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73972595,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-557401,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/chennais-2nd-airport-likely-at-parandur/articleshow/73970842.cms

VISAKHAPATNAM: CPI national secretary K Narayana demanded revenue authorities protect valuable government lands and demanded for a judicial inquiry into the illegal occupation of government lands in Visakhapatnam and its surroundings.

After visiting government site in Mithilapuri Colony in Madhurawada, the CPI leader accused CM Jaganmohan Reddy and former CM Naidu of being culprits in land scams. He alleged that the TDP government had not revealed the SIT report and added that the YSRC-led government too was going down the same road.

He alleged that reports of the involvement of TDP’s Ganta Srinivasa Rao and YSRC ’s Dharmana Prasada Rao in land scams was being kept under wraps.

“The government has been protecting land grabbers and registering cases against the Left parties for demanding to protect the government lands,” he alleged, and added that around 2,000 acres of land was encroached in and around the proposed executive capital—Vizag.tnn

486,['6/02/2020'],"Over Rs1,811 crore boost for railway infrastructure in region","This story is from February 6, 2020

Nagpur: Though no new railway projects were announced in the general budget presented by Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman on February 1, ongoing infrastructure projects under the jurisdiction of Central Railway and South East Central Railway (SECR) in the region have got a major boost with allocation of over Rs1,811 crore.

The amount doesn’t include umbrella works like allocation for passenger amenities — lifts, escalators, station works and other developmental activities including ROBs and bridges.

For example, in Central Railway general manager, who has been allocated Rs132 crore for all five divisions in Maharashtra, will allocate funds depending on the proposals and requirement.

The total allocation for Central Railway is Rs7,638 crore. This excludes extra budgetary resources and deposit. The net plan outlay of Central Railway for 2019-20 was Rs4,306 crore and for 2020-21, it is Rs4,399 crore, which is an increase of 2.16%.

It seems substantial funds have been allocated to new lines and third and fourth lines in both divisions. An analysis of the ‘pink book’, which gives financial overview of various works and projects, reveals focus remains on completion of capacity enhancement projects like tripling and quadrupling of lines in all directions from Nagpur.

“This will enable higher freight and passenger train carriage capacity. The third and fourth line between Nagpur-Sevagram has received Rs205 crores. Central Railway is running far behind its execution targets for the project though and it remains to be seen if they will utilize the money. The Wardha third line was sanctioned by the Railway Board in 2012 and line capacity in this section has reached 150%,” said railway project analyst Alok Patel.

Of the 78km third line between Nagpur-Wardha, 19km section from Butibori to Sindi and Chitoda to Sonegaon was to be commissioned by 2018. It is yet to be opened.

“No allocation for Itwari-Nagbhid broad gauge conversion has been announced despite the narrow gauge line being shut down for upgradation. This is surprising as the Rs1,400-crore project is to be constructed on 50:50 basis between state and railways. Also if land acquisition is not yet complete, the line, which is targeted to be complete by 2021, could get delayed indefinitely,” says Patel.

Patel added minor funds for huge upgradation of signalling on both Central Railway and SECR territory is a cause of concern.

The new line between Wardha-Yavatmal-Nanded has been allocated Rs450 crore. Besides, the stalled line between Wadsa and Gadchiroli received Rs76 crore. The third line between Nagpur-Itarsi has been allocated Rs165 crore.

Of the 280km third line between Nagpur-Itarsi, 13km between Dharakhoh-Maramjhiri and 17km between Chichonda-Teegaon, both in the ghat section, were to be opened in 2018. These sections have not yet opened.

In another development, funds have been allocated for quick watering arrangement at Nagpur station and some funds for raising of platforms at various stations. Only token allocations have been made for the modern train control system (MTCS) on both Central Railway and SECR.

MTCS will greatly improve safety and will also significantly increase capacity of existing tracks. Nagpur-Badnera under Central Railway is the first in Maharashtra and fourth across Indian Railways to be equipped with this system.

488,['6/02/2020'],"Flyovers bring down travel time on city roads, show data","This story is from February 6, 2020

Kolkata: Despite a mammoth increase of vehicular population and no increase in road space in the city, a data tool has found that commute time on a few stretches decreased noticeably. This decrease of travel time is largely due to new infrastructure projects and inventive interventions by cops.

Traffic movement insights from the case study on the ramp joining the AJC Bose Road and Maa Flyover shows an average decrease of 20%-30% in travel time between EM Bypass and Race Course during January 2019 and the following months, February-June, 2019, after the west-bound ramp was thrown open to traffic. There was also improvement on the Ballygunge Phanri-Golpark corridor in pre-Puja shopping days.

These insights were revealed by data insight tool ‘Movement’ launched in Kolkata by cab aggregator Uber. “Movement assesses the impact of new infrastructure projects, big events and road closures on travel time so that policymakers have the appropriate data to improve the city’s mobility patterns,” said Ratul Ghosh, Uber’s eastern India head.

Inaugurating the Kolkata leg of the multi-city initiative, Bengal’s additional chief secretary and Hidco chairman Debashis Sen harped on the issue of surge pricing. He said, “Punctuality by government employees has increased not for app cabs, but for surge-pricing. People these days reach office before the surge price sets in. Similarly, drinking has increased as people stopped driving back home.”

As is typical for the last working day of the week, Fridays in 2019 saw the longest travel time between the two points during the evening commute period. Comparing data sets between Fridays in January and Fridays in May 2019, a reduction of 38.5% in travel time can be attributed to the new ramp between the two longest flyovers in the city.

‘Movement’ data pointed to a 28% increase in travel time between the Ballygunge Phanri crossing and Golpark due to last-minute shopping at Gariahat market during the Durga Puja weekend. However, a yearly analysis between 2016 and 2019 showed a small decrease in travel-time differential each year, attributed to significant improvement and investment in traffic management by police.

“We are excited to launch ‘Movement’ in the city and hope this will encourage urban planners, governments, and transport experts to take data-driven decisions and better understand the challenges and opportunities unique to Kolkata,” Ghosh said.

Kolkata will be the fifth city to gain data-driven insights from Uber’s proprietary platform, after Delhi, Mumbai, Bengaluru and Hyderabad. With the launch of Movement, Uber’s anonymous data from millions of trips, across Delhi, Mumbai, Hyderabad, Bengaluru and now, Kolkata, can be accessed by civic authorities, local governments, transportation researchers, and technology & urban infrastructure thinktanks to discover ways to address challenges and plan future investments.

489,['6/02/2020'],HC allows fireworks at Ernakulathappan festival,"This story is from February 6, 2020

A scene from the ‘Pakalpooram’ at Ernakulathappan Temple on Wednesday

Kochi: The high court on Wednesday gave conditional permission for conducting fireworks at Ernakulam Siva Temple, or Ernakulathappan Temple, as part of the annual festival.

A division bench comprising justices C T Ravikumar and N Nagaresh granted permission for the fireworks after considering a petition filed by Ernakulam Kshetra Kshema Samithi, which conducts the festival that started on January 30.

The court has granted permission for fireworks after ‘Pakalpooram’ on Wednesday and after ‘Arattu’ on Friday morning. The court has directed that there should be a distance of at least 100m between the place where the fireworks is conducted and the spectators. Barricade should be placed 100m away from the place of fireworks and nobody other than those conducting the fireworks should be permitted entry past the barricade, the court has ordered.

Additionally, the court directed that guidelines issued by Petroleum and Explosives Safety Organisation should be strictly followed. Fireworks should be conducted in the presence of officials from revenue, fire force, and police. Police should ensure that the court’s directives are strictly followed, the bench ordered.

Fireworks allowed to be burst by the court during the two days include 2.25 lakh ‘olappadakkam’, 500 ‘thukalan’, 15 packets of Chinese crackers, 300 ‘mazhathoranam’, and 16kg of ‘mathappu’. The court also added that there is no restriction for bursting ‘kathina’ as part of the rituals as the temple already has licence for it.

The petition was filed after Ernakulam district collector, as the district magistrate, had not taken a decision on the application seeking permission that was filed on December 7. During Wednesday’s hearing, the court criticized the practice of revenue authorities in delaying decision on applications seeking permission for fireworks, essentially pushing the matter into the hands of the court.

In the case of Ernakulathappan Temple, the court pointed out that the application was filed sufficiently early, on December 7, but no decision had been taken even a day before the festival. On Tuesday, the court had ordered the collector to consider the petition and pass orders by 5pm and had scheduled a hearing on Wednesday. After the hearing on Wednesday, the court granted permission for the fireworks and scheduled further hearing in the case on Tuesday.

Rear Admiral (Retd) LV Sarat Babu, chairman and MD of HSL, said that the timely completion of refit was possible due to the active involvement of the Naval Dockyard in Visakhapatnam and the support of Eastern Naval Command. Apart from this, a strong vendor base of about 70 MSMEs developed during the refit has generated sizeable local revenue and employment, a HSL press release said.

New Delhi: National Green Tribunal (NGT) has allowed Delhi Metro Rail Corporation ( DMRC ) to construct a bridge on the Yamuna floodplain under Phase-IV project. A bench headed by NGT chairperson Justice Adarsh Kumar Goel passed the order after noting the recommendations of the Principal Committee, which said that the project could be approved subject to certain conditions.

The tribunal does not have any assistance to any rival viewpoints to deal with the present issue so as to go into any possible objection to legality — substantive or procedural, it said.

“Having regard to the nature of the project and opinion of the Principal Committee, we do not see any prima facie objection to the project. The same must, however, comply with legal requirements and procedures,” said the bench, also comprising Justice SP Wangdi.

To ensure further environmental safeguards for river Yamuna and its floodplain on account of such activities in future, besides individual evaluation of such projects on environmental yardstick, cumulative impact assessment is required to be carried out, it said. Such assessment would be able to capture holistic picture in terms of impact of such activities and the required mitigation measures, it added. TNN

New Delhi: India’s unity in diversity was yet again on display at Shaheen Bagh on Thursday as different religion and faith groups came together to organise an inter-faith prayer ceremony called “Jashn-e-ekta”. Cutting across religious lines, they, along with the anti-Citizenship Amendment Act protesters, offered prayers for peace in the country. The first such event by anti-CAA protesters was held on January 12.

Hawan, kirtan and prayers of different religions marked the second edition of “Jashn-e-ekta”. While hawan and kirtan marked the beginning of the prayer, several protesters were seen holding the Bible, holy books from different religions and posters of unity on the occasion. Religious chants reverberated in the air.

“The government has been saying that we (Muslims) are the only ones who are protesting against the CAA and NRC . These inter-faith prayers prove that people from all communities are against these,” said a protester at Shaheen Bagh.

Meanwhile, around 450 farmers from Punjab have also joined the protest in solidarity with Shaheen Bagh protesters. They will be staying there till February 8. Several artistes have also been performing at the protest site. Slaves of Freedom was expected to perform post-midnight on Thursday.

KOLKATA: The busy stretch between South City and Jodhpur Park witnessed a dramatic chase on Wednesday as a rogue auto first drove recklessly, changing lanes and hit a biker, and then fled at top speed when chased by a sergeant. While fleeing, it hit a home guard and managed to travel another 600 metres, crossing EDF Nursing Home, before it was finally stopped by another sergeant.

“It took the combined effort of the Lake police, the Jadavpur police and the Jadavpur traffic guard to arrest the auto driver,” a Lalbazar officer said.

The auto driver, Sk Azizul Rehman, could not produce his licence and said that he was not even supposed to ply in the area as he had permit for the route between Dharmatala and Park Circus Lohapool. The Lake police later placed Rehman under arrest.

According to senior officers, around 9am, Rehman broke lane rules, trying to speed opposite South City, and hit motorcyclist Nayanjit Guin. The biker fell on the road and sustained injuries on the chest, right hand and right leg. He was rushed to MR Bangur Hospital.

“When sergeant Saptarshi Brahma decided chase Rehman, the latter suddenly swerved left at the Taltala ground crossing close to EDF. A home guard, who tried to intercept him, was hit too. As the news spread over wireless radio, a sergeant with Jadavpur police station, Pushpen Sarkar, saw the auto fleeing and chased it. The Lake police, too, alerted its men. Finally, Sarkar managed to nab Rehman near the Jodhpur Park post office,” an officer said.

496,['6/02/2020'],"Art hailed, artist ignored","This story is from February 6, 2020

The painting ‘Death of Gandhi’ by Tom Vattakuzhy has been shared widely on the social media.

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: At a time when a section of people hails Nathuram Godse as a hero, some found refuge in a painting, which poignantly depicted the final moments of Mahatma Gandhi, to share their devotion for the Father of the nation. On Martyrs’ Day , several political leaders, including Congress leader Rahul Gandhi and CPI leader Kanhaiya Kumar , shared the image, unfortunately without giving credit to the artist. Along with the prominent personalities, thousands of social media users shared the painting ‘ Death of Gandhi ’ without knowing that the efforts and skills of an artist were being ignored.

Artist Tom Vattakuzhy , who resides in Muvattupuzha, is someone who believes that art finds value when it interacts with a large section of people. That is why when he drew the image under the genre ‘History painting’ after spending several meditating hours and lot of homework, he shared it on Facebook last July. “It soon got over 8,000 shares. Later my friends in Mumbai, Delhi and Kolkata called me to tell that my work is being shared widely without credits. I didn’t find much issue until it was shared by known persons like Rahul Gandhi and Kanhaiya Kumar without due credit,” said Vattakuzhy, who was trained at Visva-Bharati University in Santiniketan and Baroda university.

“We won’t use a poem without acknowledging the poet. We give credits to filmmakers. That is ingrained in our culture. However, it is different in the case of paintings. It is not just the skill or the hours spent on the painting. In genres like history painting, which is not very prevalent in our country, an artist has to invest a lot of time doing homework,” Vattakuzhy said.

The artist said that he found the need to depict the moment as there are attempts to tamper with history. “So far, artists have romanticized and personalized Gandhiji. At a time when history is at stake, I felt it was important to tell moments through the genre ‘history painting’,” he said.

Vattakuzhy has used the medium Gouache for the painting. The expressions of shock and despair of the mob in the painting adds to the emotional drama of the moment. Vattakuzhy said that he has also seen Christ in the image of Gandhi. “There is no religious connotation in bringing Christ. I see them as two persons who sacrificed to uphold truth,” he said.

Four years ago, Vattakuzhy’s interpretation of the Last Supper which depicted an undraped dancer-spy Mata Hari had triggered a controversy after a section of Christians mistook her for Mother Mary.
