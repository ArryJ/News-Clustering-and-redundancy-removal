0,['18/02/2020'],"Presenting, the ladies of Popcorn Monkey Tiger","Director Suri is a man of few words when it comes to talking about his films. His logic — to let his work do the talking. So, it comes as no surprise that even the cast of his next, Popcorn Monkey Tiger , which releases this week, is tightlipped about what they do in the film . What Suri has let slip is that Dhananjaya is in the lead, with the title suggesting three stages in his life. Amid the plethora of other cast members are also three young ladies who play pivotal roles in the film. Here’s a dekko.Devi is a central character, whose graph in the narrative happens parallelly to Dhananjaya’s Seena. “Devi is a very bold, intense, emotional character, who has seen her fair share of hardships in life, which make her the way she is. The film chronicles various stages of her life,” she says.Newbie Sapthami is also a love interest in the tale — the when and how of which will only be revealed when the film releases. “Girija is a rather bold character, who has no filter to what she thinks and says. She is very Gen Now as far as being vocal about the things she is passionate about,” says Sapthami.As Sumithra, Amrutha plays a middle-class girl, who is confused about her life and what she wants out of it. “In most middle-class families, as soon as a girl finishes her education, the next step is to get her married off. Sumithra’s case is also something like that,” says Amrutha, who is one of Dhananjaya’s love interests in the film.",entertainment,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74173623,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-179567/74173623.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/kannada/movies/news/presenting-the-ladies-of-popcorn-monkey-tiger/articleshow/74173657.cms

An official from the film’s team reveals, “This film deals with the life of Captain Gopinath . He is one of the biggest heroes and he hails from Bengaluru. He is the man who dared to give wings to the common man and made their dreams to fly a reality. Given the inspirational tone of the story, we wanted it to reach out to the common man.

Jayaraj was extremely fit and strong in his hayday and we needed an actor who can build a physique and play the role convincingly. It was Roshan Bachan who suggested Dhananjaya for the part as he believed he can do justice to the demands of this character.

4,['18/02/2020'],"I believe if a dog walks into your house, it is a sign of prosperity: Parvati","One of the first few statements that Parvati Nair makes when we talk about dogs is, “I love dogs more than humans.” Her love for animals was evident as she spoke about every single pet she has had in her life ever since she was a kid. “Once, my parents were talking about a flight crash that they saw on a news channel. The first thing that I’d asked them was if there were any pets on the flight. I love animals, especially dogs and cats. Just being around them gives me great joy,” says Parvati. The actress is a pet mom of three dogs — Cooper, a stray in Kerala, Simba, a Shih Tzu in Bengaluru, and Style, a Cocker Spaniel-Shih Tzu cross breed, in Chennai.Parvati’s love for animals began when she was a kid. “Our first dog was Tudo, a Pomeranian. She came into our lives when we were on an island. We were living in a villa, in Abu Dhabi, at that time. She was the sweetest girl and very obedient. We had her for few years, but we had to give her to a friend as we were moving into an apartment. We can’t have dogs in an apartment over there, hence the decision,” says Parvati. “Interestingly, when we moved into to our apartment, we saw a Siamese cat on the balcony. It just became our pet cat for several years. We called her Snoopy. Once I moved to Bengaluru for eduction, my friends gifted me Simba. And in our Kerala house, we have Cooper, a Daschund-cross-stray. Now that I’ve moved to Chennai, Style has come in to my life. Style’s parents are moving abroad. So, I decided to adopt him.”Though it’s unfair to ask her which is her favourite pet, Parvati says that she loves Cooper a tad bit extra. She says, “He just walked into house one day and showered us with unconditional love. I was in Kerala for over three weeks and got very attached to him. He understands our language and emotions so well. I was about to take a flight the next morning and told him that I would be leaving for a few days. He was there, waiting for me early in the morning. He is the most loving dog I’ve had in my life. I have a CCTV camera in my house in Kerala and keep checking on him all the time.”Parvati says, “ I have never bought any dog until now. All the dogs came to me when they were puppies. But Style is almost two years old. He takes time to get attached, but he became very fond of me. They are very intelligent and truly, a man’s best friend. I believe that if a dog comes into your life, it is a sign of prosperity. The only thing I look for in people is gratitude. Over the years, many people have disappointed me. But these dogs and cats have showered only love. I want to open a dog shelter some day.”Simba is the first dog Parvati had as an adult. “My friends know my love for dogs and they gifted me Simba (Shih Tzu) on my birthday. I was living in Bengaluru at that time. When Simba came in as a puppy, he looked like a lion. I couldn’t think of a better name than Simba. He is the cutest and one of the most loving pets I’ve had. He is extremely naughty and loves women. Since I had to travel a lot for shoots, I asked my friend to look after him as she was living in the same apartment. Once I went on a long shoot and my friend grew very attached to Simba. She also went through a break-up at that time. So, she wanted to have him. It was a hard choice, but it was for the best. I still video call Simba and sometimes, he waits for me at the door, thinking I’ve come. I miss him a lot,” says Parvati.Parvati says that it is very important for someone to be at home when you have a pet. “Just like how you can’t leave babies at home all alone, you can’t have a pet and leave it alone. You can’t just give him food and leave. If you are working, ensure that there is a caretaker at home. Dogs can get very lonely and depressed. So, make sure someone is there with your pet,” she says. Parvati also adds that regular check-ups are a must. “You will definitely know when your dog is unwell. You can’t expect your pet to be alright on its own. Whenever you feel there is something wrong, take him to the vet immediately. One of my friend’s dogs died because of choking. There was a small piece of bone that was stuck in its gullet. But before they decided to take him to the vet, he died. So, doctor visits are a must,” she says.",entertainment,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74176490,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-254260/74176490.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/tamil/movies/news/i-believe-if-a-dog-walks-into-your-house-it-is-a-sign-of-prosperity-parvati/articleshow/74176490.cms

It was the day we started shooting Padmarajan’s Aparan ,” says Jayaram.For the actor, 2020 has been special, as it kicked off with the superhit Allu-Arjun-starrer Ala Vaikunthapurramloo in Telugu, he is part of Mani Ratnam’s Ponniyin Selvan and has also signed projects in Telugu with Prabhas and Pawan Kalyan.But Jayaram says family is still his priority. “I am someone who has always found more happiness while spending time with my family; even more than acting in films. That’s why over the years, I have made sure I am there with them and vice versa,” explains the veteran actor.Ask him about the support that his family has provided over his career and the veteran actor says, “Without the support of our family, I believe we won’t be able to savour whatever success we achieve. We must try to find joy in whatever we do. We shouldn’t seek that only from our work. That’s the only way you can move ahead in life. If you are bothered about the collection of your movies or finding the producers for your next projects, then you miss out on other avenues of contentment. As people, there are so many other ways we can be at peace and being with our families are probably the easiest way,” he explains.Talking about wife and former actress Parvathy, Jayaram says, “She sacrificed acting when she was at the peak of her career to get married to me. Even back then she would talk about creating a family together. She hasn’t regretted quitting films for that.”Jayaram, Parvathy, son Kalidas and daughter Malavika will be heading to Manali for a few days to celebrate the occasion. Apart from their love for cinema, their kids and travelling, Jayaram says that he and Paravthy have also bonded over their compassion for animals. “Since my childhood, I have loved animals and we have had so many pets. After wedding, Parvathy too grew fond of them. Now, inside and outside our home, we have many dogs and they are all very important part of our lives. During weekends, we try to spend time with them and that also helps us bond better,” he says.Career-wise too, Jayaram seems to be in high spirits. “The shoot of the Mani Ratnam movie is progressing. Also, the success of Ala Vaikunthapurramloo has opened doors for me in Telugu. I don’t want to misuse the opportunity and I am being careful while choosing projects there.

7,['18/02/2020'],Hungry at midnight? Munch on a healthy snack,"The ideal time to have dinner is before 7 pm, say nutritionists. You’ve finally decided to give it a go and have a light and breezy meal at the designated hour. You even decide to hit the sack early, but try as you might, sleep eludes you, as you toss and turn around because of hunger pangs. You finally succumb to it and grab a bite quite late in the night. Midnight munching, as it is called, turns out to be quite a common phenomenon that college students and those with late work hours are all but familiar with. The problem with this is that the easily available snacks at that hour are often the most unhealthy, like instant noodles, chips (loaded with salt and other taste additives), aerated drinks and more, which not only affect the digestive system, but your sleep cycle as well. ""Sticking to a 7 pm dinner time, refraining from eating anything thereafter and getting used to the long hours of fasting, until you break it in the morning, takes some time getting used to. Until then, the focus should be on switching to healthier options to snack on, until you can finally say no to midnight munching altogether,"" says city-based nutritionist Ranjani Raman.Here, experts tell you just what needs to go on your plate if you are peckish at night...“Fruit popsicles can be a healthy midnight snack. While making these, avoid using sweeteners or sugar to ensure they are healthy. Although fruits are to be eaten during the day, having natural popsicles at night is a better alternative than a processed one that is loaded with sugar, artificial fruit flavours and preservatives,” says Ranjani.“Bananas are a quick, lighter option for a midnight snack, which, apart from beating hunger, also helps in another body function — digestion. The fibre content of the plantain speeds up the process of digestion in your body, even helping you clear your bowels,” says Ranjani.“In your free time, make and store chocolate at home. Up the cocoa content and cut down on sugar for a healthier version. You could also use jaggery as a substitute for sugar while making the chocolate,” suggests Tanuja.Dietitian and nutritionist Tanuja Jain suggests oatmeal if you are terribly hungry. “Oatmeal soaked in milk is the heaviest option you have for a midnight snack. Depending on how hungry you are, decide the quantity of oatmeal, soak it in milk and add some fruits as a substitute to sugar,” she says.“Dry fruits work as any other kind of snack and are also good for building one’s metabolism, while helping in curbing one’s appetite. A mix of almonds, cashews, raisins, walnut and figs can be the basic constituents of the bowl,” adds Tanuja.1) Avoid using salt or sugar while making your snacks. Try to use natural substitutes for a flavour instead.2) Avoid eating complex food, as it leads to indigestion.3) Initially, fight the urge for as long as you can. Keep the snacking to a minimum and then, try to reduce the habit by reducing the intake of the snacks.4) Eat all your meals (breakfast, lunch and dinner) and the hunger pangs will reduce eventually.",life-style,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74173280,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-3204200/74173280.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//life-style/food-news/hungry-at-midnight-munch-on-a-healthy-snack/articleshow/74173280.cms
8,['18/02/2020'],An eccentric man and his romance,"It was a sunny Saturday in Vadapalani, Chennai, but inside the floor of one of the many studios that dot the locality’s landscape, romance was in the air. Clad in a bright yellow sari, Priya Bhavani Shankar presented a sight as sunny as the weather outside while SJ Suryah , dressed in black jeans and a greyish shirt, was keenly observing the steps that a couple of assistant choreographers performed. We were at the last day’s shoot of Radha Mohan ’s Bommai, which sees this Monster pair reuniting for the second time. The director was observing the actors via the monitor, along with choreographer Raju Sundaram , who gave out instructions over the mic.The set couldn’t have been simpler. Art director Kadhirr had recreated a dry grassland of sorts on the elevated sound stage. The background was a blue screen, over which visual effects would be done during post-production.This set-up was quite different from that of another song in the film. A couple of months ago, on a rainy day, we had dropped in to witness the shoot of that song, which was picturised in a non-descript studio lot on the outskirts of the city. This one had a more artistic backdrop, with mannequins and expressionist artwork that included a woman’s face, a butterfly and gears. Dressed in a striking red gown, Priya Bhavani Shankar starkly stood out amidst the grey background. SJ Suryah was wearing a painter’s apron over his checked shirt. Choreographer Brinda’s assistants demonstrated the postures for the two actors while the choreographer was in discussion with cinematographer Richard M Nathan over the camera movements.During the break, the team spoke to us about the film and their roles. “It’s a romantic story, but the approach is different. I don’t want to reveal much now, but there is an element involving the complications of the human brain in this story,” teases Radha Mohan.Suryah plays an artist who works in a factory that manufactures mannequins. “We went to a factory in Bengaluru to shoot some of the scenes,” he informs. “Suryah was apt for this role. When I approached him, he liked the story so much that he came forward to produce it himself. He completely surrendered himself to the script,” he praises his star.“I didn’t have to do much of a preparation technically, save for the finer techniques like how to hold the brush and stuff like that. But the emotions had to be distinct. When he is with the girl, the character had to be in a total romantic mood, and while when she isn’t beside him, he has to look like someone who has lost everything in a storm,” chips in Suryah.He says that the way Radha Mohan had conceived the character was an advantage for him. “It suited my body language. In fact, I’d go and observe him when he went to narrate the story to the other technicians to capture the nuances. That was my workshop. So, on the shooting spot, I could instantly deliver what he expected of me,” he says.“This role came to me through my Monster director Nelson (Venkatesan). While we were shooting for Monster, SJ Suryah was assembling this project and had told me that he liked the script and was going to produce it himself. He trusts Nelson so much. When he had discussed this project with him, Nelson had suggested my name,” recalls Priya on how she came to be involved in the film.The two actors and the director had a script reading session before the shoot to figure out the approach to these roles. Chandini, Doubt Senthil, and Arul Shankar will be seen in crucial supporting characters.The director is collaborating with Yuvan Shankar Raja and editor Anthony for the first time. “Yuvan has given two beautiful songs — they are both romantic numbers and have been written by Madhan Karky,” says the director, adding, “More than the songs, I’m looking forward to his background score.”As for Anthony, he says working with him is a pleasure. “Once you get the edited footage from him, you can actually see his stamp in the scenes,” he credits the editor.Both Brinda master and Raju master are different in their approach to songs. She handles it more technically while he gives more importance to the emotions–Priya Bhavani Shankar, actressI believe this story is a universal one and not culture-specific. So, audiences everywhere will relate to it. That is one of the reasons why I decided to produce it. I’m planning to take this to Bollywood– SJ Suryah, actorPriya’s character will be a big surprise. It’s a very performance-oriented role. I did not want someone who did not know the language. There are so many nuances to this character… she is like a wild river– Radha Mohan, directorThere is a major transformation that happens in this film, so I have followed a particular visual treatment. This story demanded a difference in lighting and colour to show this transformation. Usually, Radha Mohan concentrates on the emotions, but this film demands an equal importance on the visuals as well– Richard Nathan, cinematographer",entertainment,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74176358,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-970553/74176358.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/tamil/movies/news/an-eccentric-man-and-his-romance/articleshow/74176358.cms
9,['18/02/2020'],"RLV Ramakrishnan: I eat, sleep and breathe Mohiniyattam","This story is from February 18, 2020

A man performing mohiniyattam is quite a rarity in Kerala, where it’s widely considered the ‘aattam’ of the ‘mohini’. So, often after his performances, RLV Ramakrishnan encounters the question, ‘Was your presentation a true depiction of the original art?’

The man, who earned his PhD in the art form a few months ago, apparently just shoots back with a few arrows from his academic quiver. Ramakrishnan says, “I ask, wasn’t the original mohiniyattam heavy on elements to entice men? Hasn’t it undergone tremendous, classical changes today? Moreover, who even said that men can’t perform mohiniyattam?”

The dancer and younger brother of late actor Kalabhavan Mani has been a popular presence in prestigious venues like Nishagandhi and Changampuzha Park. Alongside performing, his aim is to quell the myths with facts he uncovered through his doctoral thesis, Aattathinte Aanvazhikal (The path of men in dance).

Throw the famous ‘thandavam is for men and lasya is for women and thus mohiniyattam is for women’ argument at Ramakrishnan and he says, “First of all, all Indian art forms are a thandavam-lasya mix. As per Natyasastra, thandavam means pure dance, that’s all. Bharatanatyam is considered thandavam. If this argument is true, why do all genders perform it? Also, lasya just refers to abhinaya, and Natyasastra also explains it as something formed out of a man and woman’s union. Nowhere does it say that mohiniyattam is just about lasya. Also, art forms like odissi has movements that are a lot more lasya-intense than mohiniyattam. Don’t they have legends like Kelucharan Mohapatra as their greatest gurus?”

Going a bit into its history, Ramakrishnan refers to Vallathol Narayana Menon’s efforts to revive the art. “All we know from literature is that the dance form, earlier, had many elements to entice men. After 1930s, it’s in the kalaris of Kalamandalam Sathyabhama teacher that the present day mohiniyattam took shape. Vallathol took initiative to overhaul it heavily. He also defined mohiniyattam as ‘The Kerala art form without a gender discrimination!’ It is very clear in the Kerala Kalamandalam Charithra Pusthakam (a history text on Kerala Kalamandalam) that it originated as a dance form with many elements of ‘dasiyattam’ in it. The dance forms of those times reflected the feudal thought processes of the time. When art forms got revived in the following renaissance period, Vallathol originally named mohiniyattam kairali nritham, though the name didn’t stick.”

Apparently, research shows the earliest gurus of the art were all male. “During Vallathol’s time, nattuvans even used to dance with artistes on the stage, which stopped as he discouraged it wanting the dancers to get more attention. Nattuvans had to stand with the background musicians and slowly, their presence faded away,” he explains.

Smitten by the dance form, all of Ramakrishnan’s dance training has been in mohiniyattam. “I eat, sleep and breathe this art from for the past many years. I trained under my guru RLV Anand sir from the earlier days. Thankfully, colleges like RLV and Sanskrit University offered the course to men too. That’s how I took my advanced qualifications in it. I could be part of MG University’s first MA Mohiniyattam course as well, and passed it with first rank. I was the first male teacher of the subject in RLV College . I did my M Phil and PhD from Kerala Kalamandalam, and did the research under Dr MK Geetha,” he explains. Ramakrishnan, who has been performing mohiniyattam since 1998, has never been on stage in the woman’s costume of the dance form, which is often a common practice. “I have been using a Kerala style costume fashioned by myself, always. And now it’s great to see many other up-and-coming artistes doing the same.”

The artiste, who is currently a guest lecturer in Sanskrit University, performs his own choreographies for all his programmes. “I also perform giving importance to male characters in our stories. They are also presented a bit differently in comparison to how a lady dancer would showcase them, with strains of feminine bhava,” he says. All that said, he mentions the lack of platforms for male mohiniyattam dancers, whose numbers are going up. “Being an academic scholar, it has become a bit easier for me but for others, it’s still a battle,” he says.

As he mentions the contributions of his late parents and brother in his journey, Ramakrishnan gets emotional. “Despite our financial constraints, my family has always been my pillar of strength. It pains me that they weren’t there to see me earning my Ph D, but I hope to do more in their name for students from poor financial backgrounds, to keep their memories alive,” Ramakrishnan signs off.

10,['18/02/2020'],Dhananjaya signs three-part biopic on underworld don Jayaraj,"Actor Dhananjaya is all set to transform into one of Bengaluru’s infamous dons from the 70s, Jayaraj , for his upcoming project. Written by former gangster and writer, Agni Sreedhar , the movie is being directed by debutant Shoonya (who has worked with team Avane Srimannarayana) and backed by Ashu Bedra . “The movie is set between 1974 to 1977 and shows the reign of the don, Jayaraj, during that period. We are making it a three-part film because we wish to capture the journey of the character as effectively as possible,” he shares. He adds that taking on an underworld subject, creates curiosity among audiences. “World over, this is a theme that has captured the fancy of many. Even people like Al Pacino and Robert De Niro have taken up such roles. Coming back to the film, I love the way Agni sir has penned the script. I have read many of his works. The experiences he brings to the table, for this project, will lend more gravitas to the subject. I feel proud that I have got the opportunity to be a part of a challenging film like this,” he says.Most actors take up method acting , especially when it comes to biopics — Ranveer Singh for instance, had locked himself up in an apartment for weeks to slip into the character of Alauddin Khilji that he played in Padmaavat. Does he have a similar game plan in mind? Chuckling, he says, “I am not going to do anything of the sort.” However, he says, “Having said that, I am excited to prepare myself physically and mentally and transform into Jayaraj. I will be listening to inputs from the writer and director, and brainstorm with them on the nuances of this character. And, if a role like Khilji had come my way, I believe I would have been able to do justice to that too, without locking myself in a room.”Making biopics is a trend that many industries have taken up in the recent past, and Dhananjaya himself has dabbled in the genre too, with Allama. Speaking about the same, he says, “The mark of a good biopic is that you need to make the audience connect with the characters and make them wonder about the life that personality led, like the Keerthy Suresh-starrer Mahanati, for instance, which showed the life of the late yesteryear actress Savitri.

11,['18/02/2020'],Dads inspire Bengaluru's young biker gals to push the ante,"For the longest time, a girl riding a motorbike meant a non-geared easy-to-ride variant. The rare occasion she rode a more powerful mean machine, heads turned. But times have definitely changed. Girls riding geared motorbikes are still few and far between, but those who do are pushing the ante and not only doing mundane rides around town, but are also trying their hand at the more challenging dirt biking and racing, among others. We caught hold of a few college bikers to understand what drove them to it, the relationship they share with their bikes and more...A 200 cc dirt bike weighing 153 kilos with bluetooth navigationSince my dad is a biker, riding a bike came naturally to me too. As a kid I would see him ride his bike and how passionate he was about biking and I feel the same about my bike as well. I was very interested in off-roading as a kid and want to take it up professionally. The best part was that my father encouraged me to take up biking. So, when I had to buy a bike I opted for one made specifically for off-roading. My bike is different from the others as it has bigger tyres and better ground clearance. Though I have not gone off-roading yet, I do want to do it very soon. My dad has gone on many off-roading trips and has given me tips on how to go about it. I hope to join him next time.Though it is a dirt bike, I do not treat her in a rough manner. In fact, my bike is my baby and I call her Bella. I have to be careful while riding through slush, as it splatters it all around, which bystanders will not take kindly to. I take great care of my bike and have a weekly ritual to keep her spick and span — I spend more than an hour and ensure that everything is perfect. It is very difficult for me to talk about my bond with my bike, because I cannot explain it in words. It’s a feeling that I share with her and no one else. She gives me the confidence that I need. I feel like I am unique and it makes me stand out from the rest.To take up dirt biking professionally.A 300 cc bike that weighs 179 kilos and has a dual silencerOne of the main reasons I took up biking was because of my father. He goes for long rides and once I learnt riding one, I also joined him. I go for long rides with my father every Sunday. We leave by 5 am and are back by noon. Generally, we join a group of regular bikers on these trips to nearby destinations. The fun is in the ride and the stop for breakfast, which is usually at a famous darshini. After I started bringing my bike to college, I have had parents come up to me asking me to teach their daughters how to ride it. There are a lot of girls in my college who have taken up biking, which is clear indication that it is no longer just a ‘guy-thing’.This is first bike I have got and though it is not a superbike, for me it is. I am crazy about superbikes and hope to get one someday. I go biking often and recently went to the Krishnagiri Dam backwaters. Since I have a 300 cc bike, the bike ride felt like it was an exercise and I got to stretch and ride it to its true potential. Though it was a tough ride, I was comfortable and my bike bore the burnt of everything else. So, whenever I feel that it’s been tough on my bike, I apologise to it and promise to take care of it. If I find a scratch on it, or if there is some damage, I feel like someone has stabbed me in my heart.I want to explore Karnataka first and then embark on a journey around the country on my bike.A 350 cc bike that weighs 196 kilosI took up biking mainly because of my mother; she’s my inspiration. As a kid, when I saw her ride her bike, I knew that is what I wanted to do. It helped that both my parents are bikers, because they understood my fascination for biking. In fact, it was my dad who taught me how to ride a bike. I prefer solo rides, though, and have taken off on several trips since I learnt to ride a bike. The only time I had company during a ride was when I went to Savanadurga with my mother.I have named my bike Reign and she is my precious little baby. I don’t like anyone else touching my bike. It was like love at first sight for me when I saw my bike in the showroom. I remember, I had gone with the intention of buying a black bike, but the moment I laid my eyes on her, I knew I had to have her. Ever since, red became my favourite colour. I share a very close bond with my bike and I know when something is wrong with it even if I don’t get an indication from her. I speak to her as if she’s a person and believe that she speaks back to me as well.My dream is to ride to Hollywood one day.

12,['18/02/2020'],‘Mammukka didn't want Kadakkal Chandran to resemble any politician’,"Director Santosh Vishwanath ’s upcoming movie One has several specialities, the key ones being that it has Mammootty playing the role of chief minister for the first time in Malayalam and it is scripted by acclaimed writers Bobby and Sanjay. But for Santosh, it was a massive feat to mount the multi-starrer on such a big scale, considering that his debut venture Chirakodinja Kinavukal was a relatively smaller project.The work for One started almost two years ago, when the filmmaker approached Mammootty with the idea. “We only had Mammukka in our mind when the thought germinated. Had he rejected it, we would have shelved the whole project. In fact, we began the script work only after he came on board,” says Santosh.But within two years the movie reached a stage where it became a multi-starrer that also has artistes such as Joju George, Murali Gopy and Mathew Thomas in pivotal roles. “It wasn’t intentional, but we needed such a star cast. The legislative assembly scenes alone required 140 representatives from the ruling and opposition parties, and some of them are important characters in the story,” he says.From the start to finish, Santosh says it was Mammootty’s co-operation that spurred him on further. “He was extremely involved with the process. In the start, we were mulling about giving a reference for his character of Chief Minister Kadakkal Chandran . But by the second discussion, it was clear that he had already started preparing for it himself. He had specific inputs about the character’s gait and manner of speaking,” says the filmmaker.In fact, Mammootty was also extensively involved in creating the look for Kadakkal Chandran. “In the start, I was worried about the character’s getup. Mammukka said, ‘I am going to the sets in a look and we will take it from there’. But as the start date neared, I got nervous and met Mammukka to discuss more about the look. He told me what he had in mind and I shared what I had pictured, and in the end, I sketched a particular look of the character and sent him. He replied, ‘It’s almost there’. The next day he surprised all of us with his look at the character photoshoot. It was way better than I had imagined. So, you can say that Mammukka had conceived and created the look of the character himself. He was clear that the character’s look shouldn’t be similar to any politicians of the past or present,” explains Santosh.Incidentally, the movie will also not be referring to any political parties. “We aren’t showing their symbols either. Usually films use names of fake parties, but we didn’t want that. The audience knows that there are only two major political parties in Kerala anyway. People who watch the film are free to interpret who the characters are based on,” says Santosh.The team of the film though have shot in real locations where the political drama unfolds, including the Secretariat in Thiruvananthapuram. “We had a lot of support while we were shooting at the Secretariat, be it from Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan sir or opposition leader Ramesh Chennithala. People know that because it’s a Mammukka film, the message would be positive. We are trying to portray how an ideal chief minister should be through the movie, and Mammukka has also tried to present that idea based on his beliefs,” explains the filmmakers.On shooting at the legislative assembly, the director says, “We shot the film’s climax in there. We had about four consecutive days of shoot from 6pm to 6am. All artistes who played the 140 elected representatives had co-operated to shoot at the night and made it a big success. It was a huge support for me. I consider it a great blessing and experience to do a movie on a such a big canvas with Mammukka in just my second venture. I am someone who wants each of my movies to be different and fortunately I have been able to do that so far.”",entertainment,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74160394,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-176389/74160394.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/malayalam/movies/news/mammukka-didnt-want-kadakkal-chandran-to-resemble-any-politician/articleshow/74160394.cms

15,['18/02/2020'],"Mysuru’s Mahesh Chaudhary does a 2,024-km endurance ride in Thailand","This story is from February 18, 2020

What began as an activity to lose weight and get fit has become a passion for Mysuru-based entrepreneur Mahesh Chaudhary , who recently completed a 2,024-km endurance cycling ride in Thailand. Participating in the event, Mahesh, whose target was to complete the distance in under 205 hours, managed it in 156 hours and 25 minutes.

“Cycling is something that I took up six years ago to lose weight. Honestly, back then I would not have thought even in my wildest dreams that I would ever ride at an endurance event. When I began cycling, I got myself a very basic geared bicycle, which I then upgraded to a road bike, once I got more confident. Over the years, not only have I gotten better at cycling, but it has also become a passion to be able to ride more and in various condititions to really challenge the body,” says Mahesh, who is back home after this gruelling ride.

The Thailand event, though, is not his first attempt at endurance riding . “I began with smaller events that included 200-300 km rides in Bengaluru, and slowly graduated to 1,000-km with rides in Trichy and Coimbatore, among others. Then, in August last year, I did my first international event, when I did a 1,200-km ride from Paris to Brest and back, which gave me the confidence to step it up and do the 2,024-km ride in Thailand,” he says.

From the time Mahesh was set on doing a long-distance ride, he stepped up his training. “Preparation is key to be able to endure long distances over multiple days and on varying terrains. It is not only about strength training. You also need immense patience to just keep pedalling on without any distractions. In the run-up to the Paris event, I used to cycle 500-600 kms in a week in and around Mysuru,” says Mahesh.

The Thailand event, he adds, was a thrilling experience. “The first three days, we had to ride on flat roads, which was fairly easy. The real challenge began after that, when we had to ride through steep hilly regions in adverse climatic conditions. It was tough, but I knew that I had to do the distance in under 205 hours, so, I kept at it. My patience and endurance paid off, as I was able to complete it in 156-odd hours,” he explains.

His physical and mental stamina apart, Mahesh adds that sticking to a fixed diet also helped maintain his rhythm. “I took packets of ready-to-cook and ready-to eat upma, idli , etc., for the entire duration of the event. I did not want to try a new cuisine that could affect my health,” he says.

So, what’s next for him? “I have already planned my next ride in Italy, which is a 1,000-km endurance event. Just because I have done twice the distance, I will not take it lightly and am looking at training hard for it,” he signs off.

20,['18/02/2020'],Nirbhaya case latest news: Nirbhaya convicts to be hanged March 3,"This story is from February 18, 2020

NEW DELHI: Further delay in the execution of the Nirbhaya case convicts would be “sacrilegious” to the rights of the victim and for justice, a Delhi court noted on Monday, fixing 6am on March 3 as the fresh date for their hanging.

This means the four men will be executed on the said date, unless Pawan Gupta decides to file mercy or curative petitions at the last minute as he is the only one who hasn’t exhausted all legal remedies provided under the Constitution.

Though the Delhi high court-laid deadline for Pawan to file curative and mercy plea ended on February 11, authorities, including the President’s secretariat and the Supreme Court, are known to be lenient and open to hearing any plea till the last minute in capital punishment jurisprudence.

“Article 21 merely guarantees an opportunity to the condemned convicts to exercise their legal rights. However, whether to utilise the opportunity or not is a matter of choice of the condemned convicts,” additional sessions judge Dharmendra Rana observed, pointing out that “convict Pawan cannot be permitted to defeat the ends of justice by simply opting to remain indolent”.

“After a lapse of 33 months, Pawan has opted to file neither any curative nor mercy petition,” the court observed, saying there can be only “two possible inferences for such indolence; 1) either convict Pawan is satisfied with the verdict of the Supreme Court or 2) he is simply interested in merely delaying the court proceedings.”

In either case, he cannot claim that the execution of the sentence needs to be delayed further, the judge underlined, adding that even the HC gave “one more opportunity” to Pawan, “unambiguously clarifying to exercise his rights within a week, failing which requisite action shall be initiated without any further delay”.

The court also noted that the black warrant issued to fix a date of hanging has been deferred twice and Monday’s order is the third time it has been issued against the four men — Mukesh Singh, Pawan Gupta, Vinay Kumar Sharma and Akshay Thakur .

“It is hereby directed that the death warrants, as issued by this court vide order dated January 7, 2020 in respect of the condemned convicts namely Mukesh, Pawan, Akshay and Vinay, shall now be carried into effect by causing the said convicts to be hanged by the neck until they are dead on March 3 at 6am,” the court directed, acknowledging that the execution dates of January 22 and February 1 had to be deferred.

During the proceedings on Monday, Pawan’s counsel Ravi Qazi told the court that the convict “intends to move a curative petition before the Supreme Court and mercy petition before the President”.

Meanwhile Akshay’s counsel A P Singh told the court that he plans to file a second mercy petition since the first one that was rejected had shortcomings “due to poverty and ignorance” and complete facts could not be brought before the President.

But the court refused to entertain the argument, noting that ""mere preparation of a fresh mercy petition or in the words of court 'a complete mercy petition' cannot be a ground to defer the execution of the death warrants.""

The court was also informed that Vinay was on hunger strike in Tihar Jail but later took food. It directed the jail superintendent to take appropriate care of Vinay as per law. It also rejected the ground of “mental illness”, saying that the issue was raised before the apex court which found no merit in this argument on the basis of the report submitted by doctors who said the convict was “psychologically well-adjusted” and the “general condition of the petitioner is stable”.

In a related development, convict Mukesh sent a communication to the court that he does not want to be represented by advocate Vrinda Grover , after which it appointed advocate Qazi to represent him too.

Monday’s order came on applications by Nirbhaya’s parents and the Delhi government seeking fresh death warrants for the convicts after the Supreme Court granted liberty to the authorities to approach the trial court for issuance of fresh date for the execution of the convicts.

So, what prompts youngsters to take their friends along on a vacation, which is traditionally a couple’s preserve? “I think it could be because most couples either live in or at least holiday together before taking the plunge.

Most flyers do not want to enter a plane without wearing mask. In the markets, the sale is as high as in peak pollution season. But at the airport, even in the peak pollution season masks are as much in demand as they are now. The most efficient masks are those that filter out 99.99% particles, but very few of those are left.

29,['18/02/2020'],Granting permanent commission to women officers an operational challenge for Army,"This story is from February 18, 2020

NEW DELHI: It will be a major operational challenge for the Army to grant permanent commission (PC) to women officers across the board in ‘combat support arms and services’ because the force has till now largely restricted it to legal and education branches that do not involve ‘command and control’ of male troops.

Moreover, the almost 13-lakh strong force, which includes almost 43,000 officers, has neither trained women officers for command nor given them the responsibility till now. Women officers, unlike their male counterparts, were not mandated to undergo the ‘junior command course’ and other ‘adjunct courses’ as young captains or majors till now.

Sources said the Supreme Court’s order to end the prevailing gender bias in the overwhelmingly male military environs will immediately open the doors for about 600 short service commission (SSC) women officers, who have completed 10 years in service, to opt for PC in the Army. “They will have to apply for it and then undergo a board to assess their suitability,” a source said.

The country’s military brass has for long opposed PC and command roles for women due to what they call “operational, practical and cultural problems”. A senior officer said on Monday, “Women officers have been trained only as support cadre for staff appointments because they exit the force after 10 or 14 years as SSC officers as per their terms of engagement. They have not been groomed for command appointments.”

Several officers argued that grant of PC or command appointments to women officers must be based on “military needs and organisational requirements”, not social considerations or pressure exerted by some groups.

“The Army, which is heavily deployed along the borders and in counter-insurgency operations, has a limited number of ‘sheltered’ or peace station postings. With more women PC officers occupying such positions, hard or field postings for male officers will be more prolonged,” another officer said.

But it’s equally true that the armed forces have so far indulged in mere lip service on the crucial question of gender equality despite many women officers serving with distinction in uniform over the years.

Though women officers (they are not recruited in lower ranks) have been inducted into the armed forces since the early 1990s, they number just 1,653 in the Army, 1,905 in IAF and 490 in Navy in the 65,000-strong officer cadre of the 15-lakh strong armed forces. These figures do not include women officers in the medical, dental and nursing streams, who are inducted through the PC route.

Women are also not allowed to join combat arms like infantry, mechanised infantry, artillery and armoured corps (which together constitute about 70% of the Army) or serve on board warships and submarines. The IAF, which already had women transport aircraft and helicopter pilots, has commissioned eight women as fighter pilots since 2016 to break yet another glass ceiling.

But the ongoing battle was more for PC and command positions, rather than combat roles. Under pressure from the courts, the defence ministry-Army combine had last year opened PC for women SSC officers in eight arms/services (Signals, Engineers, Army Aviation , Air Defence, Electronics and Mechanical Engineers , Army Service Corps , Army Ordnance Corps and Intelligence) in addition to two earlier existing streams of Judge Advocate General and Army Education Corps .

The MoD order said only new women SSC officers would be considered for PC based on availability of vacancies and subject to “willingness, suitability, performance, medical fitness and competitive merit”, but they would be employed only in “various staff appointments” if found suitable. But the SC has now directed that even serving women officers will be considered for PC, with command appointments also being opened for them.

30,['18/02/2020'],‘1951 cutoff year to define indigenous Assam people’,"This story is from February 18, 2020

NEW DELHI: A home ministry-appointed committee is learnt to have proposed 1951 as the cutoff year for determining indigenous people of Assam while also recommending introduction of Inner Line Permit (ILP) to control the influx of outsiders into the state.

The committee — set up to suggest ways to implement Clause 6 of the Assam Accord that envisages constitutional, legislative and administrative safeguards to protect, preserve and promote cultural, social, linguistic identity and heritage of the Assamese people — has in its report, likely to be submitted to home minister Amit Shah soon, also suggested reservation of 67% of seats in state assembly for indigenous people.

The recommendations, if accepted, may help soothe frayed nerves in Assam over Citizenship (Amendment) Act, which the local population sees as contrary to provisions of Assam Accord.

The committee is believed to have unanimously recommended that those who were residents of Assam in 1951 and their descendants, irrespective of community, caste, language, religion or heritage, shall be considered as indigenous people of the state.

Besides, the panel suggested that the ILP should be introduced in Assam so that movement of people from outside the state could be controlled. As per the rules, outsiders have to take permission from designated authorities before entering the areas where the ILP is applicable.

In case of reservation of seats in the Assam assembly and Lok Sabha constituencies in the state, all members, except three, have suggested that 67% seats should be reserved for the indigenous people. The remaining three members suggested that the reservation in legislative bodies should be 100%.

“We have mentioned that there is no dissenting note but there are two suggestions for the reservation of assembly and Lok Sabha seats,” a PTI report quoted a source as saying.

In addition to the 67% reservation for the indigenous people, 16% will also be reserved for the scheduled caste and scheduled tribe communities. “So, effectively, the reservation will go up to 80% if it is accepted,” the source said as per a PTI report. In case of state government jobs, the committee recommended 80% reservation for the locals.

31,['18/02/2020'],"New Jamia videos: Cops damaged CCTV, students threw stones","This story is from February 18, 2020

NEW DELHI: In a virtual video war that has broken out between the students of Jamia Millia University and Delhi Police , three new CCTV clips of the December 15 police action on campus have surfaced. The longest one, which lasts for about five minutes, shows the hounding of students and vandalising of university property — furniture and CCTV — inside the reading room by cops who have handkerchiefs tied over their faces. Another shows a group of youths throwing stones at the police while the last one reveals students streaming into the main hall of the library.

These have come close on the heels of footage that had appeared on Sunday showing policemen barging into the library and raining lathi blows indiscriminately on the students and two other clips showing youths entering the reading room and trying to block the entrance. Some appeared to be holding stones or bricks in their hand.

Since the sequence of events is not clear, it is difficult to figure out how the chaos unfolded. The police are verifying the authenticity of the videos and have asked the Jamia authorities to provide the original CCTV footage. An SIT under supervision of the crime branch has been formed to probe the clips. “The SIT will establish the sequence of events after which we will take appropiate action against anyone found guilty. The role of the policemen seen in the video will be covered by the probe,” said Delhi Police spokesperson Mandeep Singh Randhawa .

The first video, recorded from 5.10pm, shows a group of 12 youths pelting stones at the police standing in front of Gate No. 4 that leads to the stadium. When the cops lob a tear gas shell in their direction, they scamper back into the campus. The second video, in two parts and recorded around 6.21 pm, shows students pouring into the main hall of the library. A few are wearing masks or have their faces covered with handkerchiefs. The seen is chaotic and it seems they are taking refuge from cops who are coming for them.

The third one — another version of the clip that circulated on Sunday — shows the door to the PG reading room that’s blocked with chairs and a table being ripped apart by anti-riot cops who are forcing their way in. They allow a university employee and some women students, who emerge with folded hands, to leave but rain lathi blows on the boys all around the room. As the crowd swells near the entrance with the students trying to escape, they have to put up with the cops pounding them with lathis.

Many manage to gradually escape but there are cops waiting outside who thrash them and drive others back into the room. The students are caught in a pincer move. Two cops enter the reading room charge at the youths. They are pushed towards the other entrance of the library. A few hiding under a table are also beaten up. One of the cops then tries to smash a CCTV camera with his lathi.

On Thursday, Jamia Coordination Committee, which had released the earlier videos, claimed that they were not leaking any vidoes. JCC member Safoora Zargar said the way in which the videos were being leaked, it seems the intention is to conduct a media trial and paint the students as culprits. She asked why the “police is yet to bring forward any of their personnel who were so grievously hurt that they had to take revenge on our students. And if they were doing something right, why did the policemen break the CCTV cameras?”

NEW DELHI: Twenty-eight years after they first entered the Army, women officers broke an armour-plated ceiling on Monday when the Supreme Court ordered grant of permanent commission (PC) in 10 non-battlefield services in three months and held them to be eligible to hold command posts.The government had a little over a year ago granted PC to newly-recruited women officers in these services, but not those short service commission (SSC) officers already in the force. The SC verdict extends it to all.The decision of the bench of Justices D Y Chandrachud and Ajay Rastogi to trash the Army’s “weaker sex” argument was a fitting finale to the 14-year-old litigation for equality doggedly fought by short service commission (SSC) women officers through senior advocates Meenakshi Lekhi and Aishwarya Bhati. The battle was first waged in the Delhi high court from 2006 to 2010 — which the women officers won — and then in the SC from 2010 till date.Importantly, it said those women officers who do not opt for permanent commission despite more than 14 years of service “will be entitled to continue in service until they attain 20 years of pensionable service”. “Women SSC officers shall be entitled to exercise their options for being considered for grant of permanent commission on the same terms as their male counterparts,” the bench said. Short service commission is up to 14 years.Rejecting the Army’s argument against grant of command posts to women officers on the ground that the forces were not sociologically trained to serve under women, the bench said, “The blanket non-consideration of women for criteria or command appointments, absent an individuated justification by the Army, cannot be sustained in law.”It upheld the defence ministry’s February 25, 2019, decision to grant permanent commission to SSC women officers in Signals, Engineers, Army Aviation , Army Air Defence , Electronics and Mechanical Engineers , Army Service Corps , Army Ordinance Corps and Intelligence, Judge Advocate General and Army Education Corps . Writing the judgment, Chandrachud said the decision to exclude women officers from holding command posts, determined on the basis of an individual’s performance, was indefensible.“If the Army has cogent reasons for excluding women from a particular criteria or command appointment, it may provide them to relevant authorities and if necessary, to future courts,” it said, indicating that wrong denial of promotion of women officers to command posts would be open to judicial scrutiny.Chandrachud said, “The decision of the Union government to extend the grant of permanent commission (to women officers) in support arms and services recognises that the physiological features of a woman have no significance to her equal entitlements under the Constitution.”Referring to senior advocate R Balasubramanian’s argument on behalf of the Army against extending grant of PC to all women officers, the SC frowned at attempts to stereotype them as the “weaker sex” and said it only went to show the urgent need “for change in mindsets to bring about true equality in Army”.“Confronted on the one hand with a solemn policy decision taken by the Union government allowing for the grant of permanent commission to women SSC officers in 10 streams, we have yet on the other hand a whole baseless line of submissions solemnly made to this court to detract from the vital role that has been played by women SSC officers in the line of duty,” the bench said.It recorded how the UPA government and then the NDA government dilly-dallied in implementing the Delhi HC’s 2010 decision, which was not stayed by the SC. It recorded that on August 2, 2010, the then solicitor general had given an undertaking on behalf of the Union government in the SC that “women SSC officers in service would be considered for grant of permanent commission in JAG and education branch of Army in two months”.",india,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74182980,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-382487,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/women-army-officers-win-long-battle-can-get-command-posts/articleshow/74182969.cms

Her husband, who retired as a colonel from ordnance corps and is in Mumbai, was on the other line. “We have done it,” he said. And Singh broke into a smile.TOI met Singh, one of the petitioners in a decade-long legal battle demanding gender parity in the Army, as she walked out of court, flanked by Lt Col Sandhya Yadav , Lt Col Anjali Bisht and Lt Col Maninder Virdi . The women in uniform held hands and posed for cameras.The officers said their husbands were the first to call and congratulate them on their victory. Bisht’s husband Lt Col Manish Thapliyal had, in fact, stood beside her in the courtroom when the verdict was announced.“It’s a special moment for me,” said Bisht. “I’m the first woman working in Signal Corps at this rank after 23 years of service. It hasn’t been an easy journey but despite all my achievements, things didn’t feel complete...until today. Now men and women are on an equal footing,” added Bisht, who has represented Army in national level skiing and also served as instructor at Military College of Telecommunication , Mhow.Singh said she found the strength to fight the case with her family’s support. “At home, my brother and I were treated as equals. My father who was in the IAF ensured it. When my family has never treated me differently for being a woman, why should anybody else?” She said, “The Army wanted to leave us, but we didn’t want to leave it.”For Lt Col Sandhya Yadav, the verdict brought the same euphoria that her selection in the SSC in 1990s had. “When a handful of women started a legal battle for equal opportunity, we didn’t know who else would support us. But other women kept joining us. This has made our victory sweeter,” said Yadav.A total of 11 women had moved the Delhi high court in 2010 upon completion of their 14-year service under the Short Service Commission (SSC) seeking permanent commission. By the time the case drew to a close this year, there were 70 women petitioners. Lt Col Maninder Virdi isn’t surprised that many other women officers chose to join their struggle. “If we had the same opportunities available to us that the male officers did, we would have been at higher ranks. The thought was bound to resonate with a lot of us.”The officers also believe that a “progressive” verdict such as this will allow more women to join the Army. “I hope this victory will motivate more women to join the Army,” Bisht said.

LONDON: A British Labour MP, who has been highly critical of India’s decision to scrap Jammu & Kashmir’s special status and who runs a British cross-party parliamentary group on Kashmir, was refused entry into India on Monday.Debbie Abrahams, senior vice-chair of the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Kashmir (APPGK), landed in New Delhi at 8.50am with her PIO parliamentary aide Harpreet Uppal, to be told her visa was not in order.As she reached the immigration counter, handed her passport and had her photo taken, the official shook his head and said her visa was rejected. She claimed she was then taken to an area marked “deportee” cell and “physically marched” to a plane and deported to Dubai.A home ministry spokesperson said the British parliamentarian travelled to Delhi despite having been informed in advance.The APPGK spells out its objectives plainly enough. With Labour and Conservative MPs of Indian and Pakistani heritage on board, it seeks “to support the right to self-determination of the Kashmiri people through dialogue, to seek support from British parliamentarians, to highlight the abuses of human rights in Kashmir, and to seek justice for the people there”.After the annulling of Article 370, Abrahams had written to India’s high commissioner to UK Ruchi Ghanashyam saying, “We would like to express our grave concern at the announcement by Indian home minister Amit Shah that Article 370 has been removed by presidential order.” She had referred to reports on use of cluster munitions on “unarmed civilians”, an unsubstantiated allegation.She urged the UK government to consider calling for a moratorium on India’s action for a democratic process to enable the citizens who will affected by this unilateral action to have their say.“Why didn’t they let me get a ‘visa on arrival’? Is it because I have been critical of the Indian government on Kashmir human rights issues?” Abrahams tweeted after landing in Dubai.Immigration sources, however, said the MP’s visa was not in order and wondered how the airline that flew her allowed her to board without a valid document.The MP’s return to Dubai soon went viral with right-wing handles accusing her of leading a parliamentary group that was partisan and pro-Pakistan, a charge Abrahams rejected, saying her goal was to advance social justice and human rights to all. She said she had Indian relatives she planned to visit.On her flight back to Dubai, her passport was held by the flight crew and she planned to catch a flight to Pakistan on Tuesday. The Labour MP said she was “made to feel like criminal” and claimed she was granted an e-visa in October 2019 valid until October 2020. She said she had wanted to visit a bereaved relative before travelling to Pakistan for an official visit with the APPGK.Sources in the Indian high commission in London told TOI, “When she landed in Delhi, she did not have a valid visa. That is the fundamental point... She would have had ample notice of this before her flight.”They also said any British MP, office holder or diplomat needed to apply for a proper visa through the high commission and to get an e-visa in her position was a violation of visa rules. Denying that the decision had anything to do with her stance on Kashmir, a source said, “You also have to ask yourself, how does a person get into the limelight and bring news to the forefront again? I understand that after India, she was travelling to Pakistan.”A spokesperson for the UK foreign office said, “We are in contact with Indian authorities and have spoken with the Indian high commissioner to understand why Deborah Abrahams was denied entry to India. We provided consular assistance to her whilst she was in New Delhi airport.”Conservative life peer and businessman PIO Lord Ranger defended the Indian government’s action and took a shot at Abrahams and the Labour Party . He said, “Before we interfere in other countries, we should be mindful of the consequences for our own country. Labour during the election polarised British citizens of Indian and Pakistani origin by taking an anti-India stand. Should she undermine a secular and democratic country where equality for all is enshrined in the Constitution?”",india,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74183015,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-708271,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/labour-mp-critic-of-indias-jk-policy-stopped-at-igi-deported/articleshow/74183007.cms

There is also this anxiety to go out and be free,” says Hassan. As she prepared to leave the camp on Monday, she became emotional recalling moments at the camp.On Monday, health minister Harsh Vardhan visited the facility and interacted with the evacuees as a batch of 200 was discharged, with others to be released in phases.A day in the camp started with a morning announcement calling people for a routine check-up followed by breakfast usually comprising of bread-butter, fruits, parathas or puri-sabji, served between 8am and 9.30am. During the day, people spent time playing indoor games, chatting, watching television or surfing the net. Lunch and dinner were served on the second and fourth floor of the five-storey building, respectively.“I will not forget the time I spent here and the way ITBP officers took care of us. Despite the risk of infection, they treated us and even pampered us like their own children. Every morning, they would come make our bed, clean our rooms and ensure that we go for routine check-ups,” Hassan said.A third-year MBBS student at Hubei University of Medicine , she was among the 406 evacuees from Wuhan brought back by the Centre following the novel coronavirus outbreak in China.Many others — mostly medical students studying in Wuhan and nearby cities — have similar stories to share about table tennis and carrom matches and chats with ITBP officers.Reeba Khan, from Jammu & Kashmir, studying MBBS, salutes the spirit of officers, doctors and paramedics who took care of them. “The officers provided us with the best possible facilities. They provided us with all basic necessities, medical screening was done every morning,” Khan said.Doctors who treated the students said there were challenges too. With people from different backgrounds and habits, managing food and other needs was not easy. For instance, some demanded non-vegetarian food even as WHO’s treatment protocol prescribes a strictly vegetarian diet. ITBP brought psychiatrists and psychologists on board to convince people to accept vegetarian diets.“Initially we had no clue whether any of these evacuees were infected with the virus. So, we had to ensure that the arrangement was such that we prevent any spreading of the virus. Besides, we also had to counsel them to wear masks all the time, maintain a safe distance while talking to each other or playing games in the common room,” says Dr A P Joshi, chief medical officer at ITBP. Dr Joshi calls it his “toughest assignment” so far.“These people — students or working individuals — left the comfort and safety of their homes and adapted very well to different challenges of a quarantined facility. They were properly counselled and various coping mechanisms to overcome psychological stressors were suggested,” said Dr Urmi Chakraborty, clinical psychologist from RML Hospital Doctors say they took precautions beyond the usually required quarantine of 14 days. All inmates were screened three times and were given discharge certificates only after they tested negative in all of them.

38,['18/02/2020'],India-US trade deal likely only after American elections,"This story is from February 18, 2020

NEW DELHI: With an India-US trade deal timed out before President Donald Trump ’s visit, the Washington has informed New Delhi that it would look to completing negotiations after the US elections in November. That would mean the earliest the talks could resume would be in 2021. This was told to the Indian political leadership by US trade representative Robert Lighthizer in a conversation late last week when he decided to call off his visit to India.

The trade deal would have been an important “deliverable” for the Trump visit scheduled for next week. The discussions have dragged on for ages — the deal should have happened before PM Narendra Modi landed in Houston last year, then it was pushed back to after the UNGA, then it was supposed to happen before the Trump visit. The curious part is that the negotiations are not deadlocked.

India believes the US is testing its anxiety level — how desperately does New Delhi want the deal? Senior government sources said India had clarified its “red lines” to the US. “The ball is in the US court,” they said. India was willing to complete negotiations whenever the US was ready, they said.

That is also the message foreign secretary S Jaishankar gave to the EU on Monday, when he met the leadership in Brussels. India wants to restart BTIA talks with the EU, which were suspended in 2013. But EU officials are yet to get back into negotiation mode with India.

According to senior government sources, the two sides had covered the difficult ground, and need a political-level meeting — between Lighthizer and commerce minister Piyush Goyal and his junior Hardeep Puri — to take final decisions on quantities and tariff quotas. But there is enough unhappiness to go around between the two sides, certainly at the official level. In recent weeks, the Indian negotiations have been led by Goyal and Puri, with assistance from Jaishankar. All three, sources said, have full mandate by Modi to close the deal.

On the other side, the US believes the Indian government, with its tortuous inter-agency processes, had dragged the processes unnecessarily. They have said the Indian side has reopened discussions when it has appeared close to a decision, for instance on DDGS (dry distilled grain soluble) poultry feed where the Indian side introduced new tests, or on dairy imports. On the Indian side, there is frustration that the US introduced new items, like pecan nuts and cranberries, into the negotiations, or even electronic payments (essentially asking for national treatment for international credit card companies, in line with the domestic RuPay system).

US’s top official for South Asia Alice Wells told reporters in Washington over the weekend, “If a tiny Phase 1 trade deal cannot be done when US President Donald Trump visits India, it would be a big setback.”

In 2018, Canada had granted a total of 3.55 lakh study permits - the newly released figures for 2019 signify an overall increase of 13.8% over the previous year.An analysis of the past three years shows that while the number of Chinese students to be granted a study permit has shown a miniscule decline, the inflow of students from India is steadily on the rise.The number of Chinese students to be granted study permits in 2019, at 84,710 was slightly lower than the previous year’s figure of 85,165. In contrast the number of Indian students to be granted a study permit has increased by 30.3% to 1.39 lakh, over the previous year’s figure of 1.07 lakh. With just 82,990 permits granted to Indian students in 2017, it reflects a 68.3% increase over two years.Canada is increasingly attracting more foreign students. This can be attributed to various factors such as uncertainties relating to optional training programs (OPT) for international students in US – some of these issues were settled via court intervention. Post completion of US studies there are also challenges in obtaining an H-1B visa (the most commonly used work visa) for those at the entry level.Karan Gupta, a study abroad career counsellor, said, “If a student studies in Canada he or she is more likely to land a well-paying job and settle down in the country. This is the primary reason for the numbers going up."" He added that the country is perceived to be save and welcoming of foreigners. “The country also has some world-renowned universities such as the University of Toronto , University of Waterloo and McGill university and students are keen to attend these universities,” said Gupta. With the UK now offering a two-year work permit to students from next year, some students who were considering Canada may now consider UK, he added.Canada permits students to work part-time and fund their studies and a post-graduation work permit (PGWP) is available for a maximum of up to three years (based on the study course). The Canadian education and work experience, also helps garner higher points under the Express Entry route, if the erstwhile student wishes to obtain permanent residency. To top it all, job opportunities in the technology space are increasing in Canada.“Education is a by-product of the desire to get a livelihood. Students are seeing Canada as an easier option for migration,” said KP Singh, CEO of Institute of Management and Foreign Studies . Most serious students are driven by courses in futuristic sciences, biology, engineering and IT. While for many the courses and universities do not matter, the serious ones opt for study options in Toronto and Vancouver,” said Singh. He added that Canada, like Australia, is now promoting their under-developed regions to attract more foreigners.An immigration attorney admits that the job market is not as vibrant in non-tech segment. He also points out that dubious immigration agents, lure immigrants to Canada on a study visa – whereas these students actually engage in work alone and not studies. The authorities are aware of this issue and are more stringent in issue of student visas.Study permits are typically required to be obtained by international students in almost all cases, with a few exceptions – such as for a course of a very small duration. It is not a visa, but a document that authorises international students to study at designated educational institutions. It is usually valid for the entire duration of the study course plus and extra 90 days to enable the student to leave Canada or apply for an extension.

40,['18/02/2020'],Govt may ease age bar for EWS quota,"This story is from February 18, 2020

NEW DELHI: The Modi government is likely to approve “age relaxation” for the economically weaker sections in the new 10% reservation system, in a move that would virtually equate the upper castes with OBCs and accelerate the negation of the uniqueness assumed for socially backward communities.

The “age relaxation” gives concession in eligibility age laid down for appointment in a government job or admission in an educational institution. Sources said relaxation for upper castes is likely to be three years, which is what is available to OBCs under the 27% Mandal reservations. The proposal may come for Cabinet approval soon, possibly in the next meeting itself.

As reported by TOI on August 5, 2019, the Department of Personnel and Training turned down an earlier proposal from Union social justice ministry for “age relaxation” under the EWS quota. In its negative response, DoPT minister Jitendra Singh had argued that “in the past, the question of age relaxation has been decided only after observing the impact of reservation policy, ie, whether the required number of persons from that particular category are getting inducted in the services reserved for them or not.”

It implies that age concession is given only if the beneficiary group of a particular quota regime is unable to compete and succeed within the laid down norms of age.

Given the argument, relaxation under EWS was seen as unlikely because economically weaker upper castes are assumed to be competitive. This is unlike Dalits and backwards who, because of historical social handicap, are unable to compete under a lower age bar. The shortfall noticed during earlier years of SC/ST/OBC quotas led to their being given the age rebate.

In his response, minister Singh had pointed out that quotas for OBCs were implemented in 1993 but the age relaxation was extended to them in 1995. Also, quotas for SCs and STs came into existence before and after independence while age relaxation to them was given in 1952 for non-gazetted posts and in 1955 for gazetted posts.

Given the backdrop, the sudden turnaround by the Centre reflects an urgency on the part of BJP to build on the upper caste olive branch. The 10% EWS reservation was approved by the BJP government ahead of 2019 Lok Sabha polls after its defeat in Madhya Pradesh , Chhattisgarh and Rajasthan assembly polls in December 2018.

In wake of the defeat, the ruling party had come to believe that upper castes were angry with its moves like undoing the Supreme Court order diluting the SC/ST Prevention of Atrocities Act.

Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan

NEW DELHI: For the second time in three days, India hit out at Turkish President Recep Erdogan for his support to Pakistan on the Kashmir issue, as it accused him of not just interfering in India’s internal affairs but also justifying Islamabad ’s support to cross-border terrorism.

In a strong demarche to Turkey ’s ambassador to India Sakir Torunlar , the government warned that Turkey’s actions will have serious implications for its bilateral ties with India.

“These remarks reflect neither an understanding of history nor of the conduct of diplomacy. They distort events of the past to advance a narrow minded view of the present,’’ said MEA spokesperson Raveesh Kumar .

The government went on to add that Erdogan’s remarks, in which he alleged that Kashmiris were suffering because of unilateral action by India, was but one more example of a pattern of Turkey interfering in the internal affairs of other countries.

“India finds that completely unacceptable. We particularly reject the repeated attempts by Turkey to justify the cross-border terrorism practiced so blatantly by Pakistan,’’ said Kumar.

NEW dELHI: The department of telecom (DoT) has sought the opinion of Solicitor General Tushar Mehta and other top legal minds on invoking bank guarantees (running into several thousand crore of rupees) for “delays” in realising “full dues” from mobile operators, who had been ordered to pay dues up to Rs 1.47 lakh crore in three months, following the October 24 AGR (adjusted gross revenues) judgement by the Supreme Court.On Monday, mobile operators — mainly Bharti Airtel , Tata group and most-troubled Vodafone Idea — scrambled to make part-payments to the government and made promises of clearing the dues before the next hearing in the top court on March 17.The companies paid a total of Rs 14,697 crore to the telecom ministry, with Bharti Airtel paying Rs 10,000 crore (Rs 9,500 crore for Airtel and Telenor and Rs 500 crore for Bharti Hexacom ), Vodafone Idea submitting Rs 2,500 crore, and Tata Teleservices and Tata Teleservices ( Maharashtra ) Rs 2,197 crore. Vodafone Idea, whose petition to thwart coercive action by DoT was rejected by the Supreme Court earlier in the day, also promised to pay another Rs 1,000 crore by week-end.Sources in the ministry told TOI that Mehta had been approached over the weekend as the telecom ministry wants to go “strictly by the rule-book this time around” after receiving severe censure from the Supreme Court over relaxation given to telcos.“We will go by the rules, and the licensing agreement. The agreement clearly stipulates that the government has the right to invoke bank guarantees in case of payment defaults after notices have been served. If this is not found to be sufficient, then in extreme cases and after a show-cause notice, the government even reserves the right to cancel telecom licence,” a source said, though adding, “the last resort is still not being contemplated as crores of mobile subscribers may get hit.”Sources said highest-levels in the government — including PMO -- are seized of the matter since an extreme step may disrupt the mobile connectivity of crores of subscribers. For example, both Vodafone Idea and Airtel have over 30 crore subscribers each.The telecom department has sought over Rs 53,000 from Vodafone Idea, around Rs 35,000 crore from Airtel, while seeking nearly Rs 14,000 crore from Tatas. However, the companies do not agree with these findings, and have been doing their own math, especially as they have been asked to do self-assessment.",business,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74183108,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-100168,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/dot-seeks-legal-view-to-recover-dues/articleshow/74183104.cms
44,['18/02/2020'],Skyrocketing LPG prices hit households and eateries,"This story is from February 18, 2020

PATNA: The skyrocketing prices of LPG cylinders are burning holes in the pockets of residents and food business owners in the city. The 14.2 kg subsidised cylinder is now priced at Rs965 in the city, which was Rs816 on January 1 this year. Similarly, the commercial LPG cylinder now stands at Rs1,670.

Homemakers are reeling from the hike in cylinder price which has increased exponentially over the past five months. “Onions, garlic, pulses, bread and now LPG; prices of everything are increasing. The government does not seem to be concerned at all about the common people. I am not able to manage my monthly budget,” said Smita Verma, a resident of Kankarbagh.

Kadamkuan resident Payal Kumari said, “The price of LPG cylinder has now gone beyond my reach. But I can’t even remove it from my kitchen as I won’t be able to cook without it.”

Amit Kumar, an LPG dealer in Hanuman Nagar, said, “LPG rates change on the first day of every month, however, due to the Delhi election it was postponed. Unlike every month, the increase isn’t of Rs30-Rs40 but of Rs149, which is quite expensive for most of the residents in the city.”

Restaurant owners, too, are at their wits end. “Unlike onions and garlic, we can’t replace LPG cylinders. In fact, 99% of the restaurants in the city use LPG cylinders for cooking. We can’t start cooking on coal all of a sudden,” said Rakesh Jaiswal, owner of a restaurant on Gola Road.

“I have decided to increase rates of food served at my restaurant due to the surge in LPG prices,” said the owner of a restaurant on Boring Road.

Market experts and the state-controlled oil marketing companies (OMC) in the city said prices of domestic as well as commercial cylinders change every month based on the international rate. “The prices have increased by more than Rs300 in the past six months. Last year in September, a 14.2kg LPG with subsidy was being sold at Rs684 and commercial 19kg cylinder was being sold at Rs1,271. The international market rates of LPG are quite high, due to which the prices have increased in India,” said Anita Kumari, the proprietor of an OMC in SK Puri.

She added, “Those who have already made the online booking, will also have to pay the revised amount. However, people who have made online payment prior to the increase in LPG prices won’t have to pay any extra amount.”

PATNA: The state disaster management department has chalked out a standard operating procedure (SOP) to be followed for preventing urban flooding in future. It outlines the roles that the administration and various departments should play at the preparedness, rescue, relief and rehabilitation stages.

According to disaster management principal secretary Pratyaya Amrit, a draft of the SOP is ready.

“Prolonged waterlogging in several areas of Patna, which happened for the first time last year, prompted us to come up with an SOP to tackle urban flooding. It is aimed at minimizing loss of life and damages to property and implementation of restoration and rehabilitation measures,” Pratyaya told this newspaper.

The departments concerned will have to make preparations for pre-flood, pre-monsoon and post-flood situations that include provision of temporary shelters, health camps and community kitchens, among others.

“Before finalizing the draft, we will consult the urban development and housing department and also give a presentation before chief minister Nitish Kumar for his approval,” Pratyaya said.

Many areas in Patna had been submerged in water, following torrential rainfall for three days from September 27 last year. The government later formed a four-member committee to identify the officials responsible for negligence. The report held former Patna Municipal Corporation (PMC) commissioner Anupam Kumar Suman, former Bihar Urban Infrastructure Development Corporation managing director Amrendra Prasad Singh and 13 others responsible for the menace. On February 14, the general administration department issued a formal notification for suspension of an IAS and two BAS officers for their negligence.

Now, steps are being taken for construction of new drains and cleaning of existing ones by the PMC. Besides, encroachments are being removed from major drains in the city to prevent accumulation of rainwater.

PATNA: Bihar State Road Development Corporation Limited (BSRDCL) managing director (MD) Sanjay Kumar Agarwal on Monday said two foot overbridges (FoBs) would be built on the six-lane road being constructed to connect R-Block with Digha.

While inspecting the ongoing R-Block-Digha project , Agarwal told TOI, “One FoB will be constructed near Pani Tanki for safe movement of pedestrians while the location of the other one will be finalized soon.”

The R Block-Digha road, which will act as a north-south expressway corridor in the state capital, is passing through Hartali Mor, Punaichak, Shivpuri, Mahesh Nagar, New Patliputra Colony, Rajiv Nagar and Patliputra industrial area.

Altogether four flyovers are part of the project. Superstructure of the flyovers at Rajiv Nagar and Shivpuri have been built whereas works are underway for construction of a flyover on Hartali Mor. Another one over the Danapur-Bankipore Road is proposed to be built in the second phase.

The BSRDCL MD also instructed the officials concerned to consult the Patna traffic SP and form an alternate traffic plan for vehicular movement during the period of construction of the Hartali Mor flyover.

“The flyover’s superstructure will be built round-the-clock to ensure that vehicular movement is not affected for a long time,” said Agarwal.

The six-lane road with two service lanes is being constructed after removal of a railway line on which a passenger train used to operate daily in the morning and evening. At the request of the state government, the railways agreed to transfer the land for the R-Block-Digha project in June, 2018. Construction works began in January last year.

Agarwal said, “The project is targeted to be completed by June. Bidding process for the second phase is likely to be finalized in two or three days.”

PATNA: ‘Bihar Sadan’, a swanky 12-storey new guest house of the state government in Delhi will be ready in next four months, a senior government official told CM Nitish Kumar here on Monday.

Coming up on a two-acre plot in Dwarka Sector-19 area, Bihar Sadan will be third guest house of the state government in the national capital after two existing houses – Bihar Bhavan and Bihar Niwas.

“Construction work on Bihar Sadan is going on at a fast pace. It will be completed in the next four months,” state’s building construction department (BCD) principal secretary Chanchal Kumar said while making a presentation before the CM on re-development plan of the existing Bihar Bhavan and Bihar Niwas. The presentation was made at a high-level meeting held at Sankalp hall in the CM’s official residence here.

BCD minister Ashok Choudhary, who also attended the meeting, said the CM directed construction companies to hand over Bihar Sadan to the state government in next three/four months. “It will be ready in next four months,” Choudhary said.

Being constructed at a cost of Rs 78.78 crore, the new building will have 10 floors besides basement and ground floor. It will have 118 rooms, a conference room for 200 people and cafeteria for 180 people. It will also have an exhibition area for 200 people and parking facility for 224 vehicles. Of 118 rooms, there will be eight VIP suites, two VVIP suites, 89 double bedrooms and 19 single bedrooms.

“Once completed, it will provide accommodation to dignitaries from the state, including the governor, CM, ministers, legislators, high court judges, state government and guests from other places,” a BCD official told TOI.

After reviewing the presentation on the re-development plan of the two existing guesthouses, Nitish asked the BCD officials to focus on renovation of Bihar Niwas in the first phase. He advised the officials to construct an auditorium on the premises of Bihar Niwas.

“Under the redevelopment plan, there should be enough provision for residential accommodation of the officers and employees working at the Bihar Niwas on the same premises. It will be better if we can make arrangement on a fixed rate for common people who visit Delhi for treatment at different hospitals,” Nitish told the officials.

He asked the officials to prepare a better draft plan after studying designs of other important buildings. “Senior officials should visit the location time to time to ensure that renovation work is executed in a better way,” Nitish said.

He further asked the officials to spare certain portions of Bihar Bhavan to accommodate Delhi-based offices of the state government.

State’s chief secretary Deepak Kumar, cabinet secretariat department’s principal secretary Deepak Prasad and the secretaries to the CM Manish Kumar Verma and Anupam Kumar also attended the meeting.

Weavers from Laskana at police commissioner's office on Monday

Surat: Powerloom weavers of Laskana industrial estate have demanded police protection for smooth operation of their units.

About 80 per cent of over 400 textile weaving units in Laskana industrial estate on Surat-Kamrej road, shut for over a week after death of a textile worker in one of the powerloom units, had reopened on Sunday.

A delegation of Laskana-Kamrej Weavers’ Association met police commissioner RB Brahmbhatt on Monday. The weavers informed him that some anti-social elements were instigating workers in Laskana to stay away from work. They have been circulating pamphlets in Oriya language asking workers to not go to their units.

Laskana-Kamrej Weavers’ Association president Babu Sojitra said, “We have urged the police commissioner to provide police protection to the weaving units in Laskana. The weavers are under constant fear of violence and that they are not able to operate in a peaceful environment. The anti-social elements are distributing pamphlets to workers asking them not to go the units.”

Laskana Weavers’ Association vice-president Shailesh Kukadia said, “Over 400 units manufacture more than 15 lakh metres of fabrics per day in Laskana. For the last one week, production of fabrics has come to a standstill due to workers’s strike. Weavers will incur heavy losses due to disturbances to operations and hence requested police to provide protection to the industry.”

51,['18/02/2020'],Innovatively designed diamond packets with better security in the offing,"This story is from February 18, 2020

This new design is the brainchild of Shree Ramkrishna Exports

Surat: This could be a small , but an important discovery to provide better security to the diamonds during trading.

Since its inception, the diamond industry has been using traditional packets made out of paper to store the precious stones. Every time, the diamond merchants and manufacturers must fold and unfold the packets during the trading deals to show the diamonds. There are chances of losing few diamonds during the trading process. After the deal is struck, the diamond packets are destroyed.

A De Beers sightholder company, Shree Ramkrishna Exports (SRK) has come up with an innovative design of the diamond packets for better security. These diamond packets are reusable and that the diamonds could be seen from a transparent peep-in window, which gives the diamond owners surety about the physical presence of diamonds in the packet without opening it.

Talking with TOI, director of SRK, Shreyans Dholakia said, “We were working on the design of diamond packets since last three years. The packets called ‘window of hope’ are environment friendly and made out of the high quality reusable paper. Unlike the traditional packets, these packets offer complete security as the owner does have to fold and unfold the packet to see the diamonds.”

Dholakia added, “We had applied for the patent for the diamond packets, but later withdrew in the wider interest of the diamond industry. The entire diamond industry will be able to use the innovative diamond packets in the coming days.”

According to Dholakia, there are thousands of diamond offices in Surat and Mumbai where lakhs of carats of diamonds are stored traditional packets. Imagine the time consumed in folding and unfolding of the packets and the waste of paper once the diamonds exchange hands.

President of the Surat Diamond Association (SDA), Babu Kathiriya said, “Diamond paper packets are used in the industry since decades. You need to fold and unfold the packets every time you show the diamonds to others. In the process, sometimes, there are chances of losing few diamonds. A few cases were reported where the conman duped diamond traders with stones in the packet. There is a need to securing the diamonds while trading.”

DEHRADUN: The city’s iconic Parade Ground is going to see a major overhaul by the end of this year as part of a Smart City-related rejuvenation plan. As per the plan, Gandhi Park will be joined with Parade Ground and the road between the two places, which leads to Kanak Chowk, would be restricted for vehicles. A jogging track and a cycling lane is also proposed to be constructed along the boundaries of Parade Ground and Gandhi Park.

Providing details, Surya Kotnala, assistant general manager of Dehradun Smart City Limited (DSCL), told TOI,“The Parade Ground will see major changes under the Smart City project. The road between the Parade Ground and Gandhi Park will be made free of any traffic movement. Also, the Republic Day Parade which is now held in the ground will henceforth be taking place on the road, the way it takes place in Delhi. We have also conceptualised a provision for bi-directional stage which will face towards the road (Kanak Chowk). But when a rally or some such big event is taking place, then the same stage will face towards the ground. Extensive landscaping and tree plantation will also take place in the Parade Ground and we will make it as green as possible.” The official added that a budget of Rs 21 crore has been earmarked for the project which is expected to be completed by the end of this year.”

Parade Ground has long been a prominent venue for various events in the city — ranging from trade fairs to political rallies and Dussehra celebrations. Historically though, the ground which is believed to have come into existence around 1815-16, was used by the British Indian army for conducting march past of its troops and a part of it was used as a stable for horses as well.

Over the years, the ground not only lost the original purpose for which it was meant but also its greenery. Many old residents claim that the heritage of the Parade Ground is under severe threat.

“Gandhi Park and Parade Ground are the two lungs of the city. But now, especially in the Parade Ground, one can hardly see any green space left. It isn’t properly maintained either due to which a lot of water-logging happens especially during the monsoon season. Steps like rainwater harvesting are urgently required along with proper maintenance of this iconic ground,” said Brig KG Behl (retired), a veteran resident of the city.

The Parade Ground used to be under the district administration in early 20th century but post-independence, it is managed by the district sports administration mainly because a part of the ground has sporting facilities like badminton and basketball courts besides an athletics field.

An official of the sports department told TOI that a nominal fee is charged for the use of the sporting facilities to encourage local sportspersons and the department is primarily earning revenue by giving the rest of the land of the ground on rent to organise trade fairs and other functions.

However, this arrangement, residents feel, has been the primary reason for the Parade Ground getting spoiled.

“I strongly believe that all the sporting activities should take place in Raipur where the sports college is located and the Parade Ground should be left alone. Apart from sports infrastructure, there are other non-sports buildings too which should be removed and the ground should be left without any encroachments,” said Behl.

Kanhaiya Kumar

PATNA: A 25-year-old youth was thrashed in Lakhisarai after he threw a slipper at CPI functionary Kanhaiya Kumar at a rally held as part of his month-long ‘Jan Gan Mann Yatra’.

The injured man, Chandan Kumar, said to be an activist of a fringe outfit ‘Brahman Bhumihar Ekta Manch’, has been admitted to the Lakhisarai Sadar Hospital under police custody.

This is the ninth attack on Kanhaiya since he launched his yatra against the CCA and the NRC from West Champaran on January 26. The yatra is scheduled to reach Patna on February 27.

The latest incident took place around 2 pm when Kanhaiya was addressing a gathering at Gandhi Maidan in Lakhisarai town on the issue of CAA and NRC. Chandan, emerged from the crowd and started shouting ‘Kanhaiya desh ka gaddar hai (Kanhaiya is a traitor)’ and threw the slipper targeting the stage.

The projectile missed the CPI leader and fell short of the stage, but enraged over the youth’s conduct, supporters of Kanhaiya caught hold of him and thrashed him. He received injuries on his head. Police personnel deputed at the venue intervened and rescued the youth from mob fury.

The SHO of Kawaiya police station, Rajiv Kumar, said the arrested youth was undergoing treatment under police custody. He was taken into custody soon after he tried to create ruckus and threw a slipper at the CPI functionary. “Kanhaiya escaped unhurt as the slipper fell short of the stage,” the SHO said, adding, a complaint has been lodged against Chandan.

Later talking the media persons, Chandan, alleged that Kanhaiya was spreading a communal message in the garb of protest against CAA and NRC. “People with Left mindset will not succeed in their mission to divide the nation,” he said.

On February 14, his convoy was pelted with stones near Ara in Bhojpur district. Earlier, his convoy had faced the wrath of CCA supporters in Saran, Katihar, Supaul, Jamui, Kaimur and Buxar districts.

Last week a delegation called on additional chief secretary (home), Amir Subhani, and demanded security for Kanhaiya in the wake of frequent attacks on him and his convoy in various districts of the state. The state police headquarters is keeping a close watch on the JNUSU leader’s rallies.

55,['18/02/2020'],SP moves SC for Tata Sons board seat,"This story is from February 18, 2020

(Representative image)

MUMBAI: The Shapoorji Pallonji ( SP ) Group, which holds 18% in Tata Sons , has moved the Supreme Court against the December 18 appellate tribunal order that reinstated scion Cyrus Mistry as the chairman of the Tata holding company.

The group said while the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) had found the conduct of Tata Trusts — majority shareholder of Tata Sons — to be prejudicial, it failed to provide vital reliefs that would have put an end to the oppressive conduct of the majority stakeholder.

The group, in its 45-page appeal filed before the apex court, said the NCLAT had not granted proportionate representation on the board of Tata Sons to ensure SP’s interest and investment — now worth over Rs 1 lakh crore — were protected in future. The NCLAT order had allowed Cyrus to continue on the Tata Sons board until his tenure ends.

The SP Group said while abuse of power and conduct was found in the manner Cyrus was removed from the chairman’s post, his reinstatement in office was not sought. Instead, it had sought deletion of certain provisions in Tata Sons’ Articles of Association (AoA), which were tools for minority shareholder oppression.

The group added that the NCLAT had erroneously said it did not have the powers to alter AoA even though it has correctly recorded that the relationship between the Tata Group and the Mistry family was of a quasi-partnership. The SP Group’s appeal comes nearly five weeks after the Supreme Court stayed the December 18 order.

The SP Group also said that the two enterprises have had a relationship since the 1920s when Cyrus Investments (formerly FE Dinshaw) arranged funds for Tata Sons. SP later increased its stake in Tata Sons by acquiring shares from the Tata family and today owns about 18% in the company.

The relationship between Tatas and Mistrys had also spanned engagements in other areas, including the development of Sterling Theatre complex in Mumbai and sale of businesses to each other, including Special Steels and Forbes Gokak.

The SP Group said Cyrus’s father Pallonji Mistry and his two children served as directors on boards of 20 Tata companies. The senior Mistry was a member of the Tata Sons board from June 1980 to 2004. Cyrus took over his father’s position at Tata Sons in August 2006. He was removed from his directorship in February 2017 following a boardroom battle over differences in management objectives.

56,['18/02/2020'],Swedish investor lowers Quikr valuation by 45%,"This story is from February 18, 2020

(Representative image)

BENGALURU: Swedish investment firm Kinnevik has marked down the valuation of Quikr by 45% to about $570 million from more than $1 billion as of September 2019, the firm said in its annual earnings statement earlier this month.

The fall in valuation comes as the Bengaluru-based online classifieds and transactions marketplace discovered fraud in its co-living and auto segment, where employees along with vendors faked transactions. This led to the company laying off 1,000 from its 3,000-odd workforce, besides shutting down divisions where there was fraud, as TOI had reported in December.

Kinnevik notes that the reduction in Quikr’s worth is due to the company “reducing its footprint”. Additionally, it changed methodology of valuation from discounted cash flows to net revenue multiples “linked to the trading of its publicly listed peers”, besides the fraud, Kinnevik executives said in an analyst call.

The development is significant as Quikr will be one of the first unicorns to see a valuation cut by its own financial investor in recent years. While Flipkart suffered a series of markdowns in 2016, only to bounce back later, other online marketplaces like Snapdeal and ShopClues have also seen a fall in their net worth from 2016 peaks.

Kinnevik owns 17% in Quikr and is one of its largest shareholders along with Tiger Global Management, Warburg Pincus and Matrix Partners India, among others.

Kinnevik has invested a total of about $106 million in Quikr, including $15 million last year in what seems to be an internal round of funding for the company.

The Swedish firm is also hoping for a recovery. “The whole purpose of downsizing the company...to get in a situation we’re not dependent on external capital...with that situation, Quikr can buy some time now to improve the healthy part of the business, and from this point in time, increase the valuation rather than the other way around,” said Kinnevik CEO Georgi Ganev in the analyst call.

A Quikr spokesperson did not comment on the valuation markdown and directed TOI to a blog from January 30 about its restructuring and fraud. “We’ve undertaken third-party audits, identified and culled out such players from our marketplace, exited such employees from our company and initiated necessary action against all the parties involved,” said the post. It added that the fraud has not impacted categories like jobs, goods and services that drive a majority of its revenues.

For the year ending March 2020, Quikr generated just under $65 million in annualised cash revenue at a yearly growth rate of a little less than 60%, according to Kinnevik’s report for six months ending September.

Quikr had announced its last round of funding nearly five years ago in April 2015, when it had mopped up about $150 million and became a unicorn. Since then, the company has done a series of primarily stock acquisitions, including mortgage lender HDFC’s realty brokerage business in 2017 and more recently Zefo, a pre-owned goods seller backed by Sequoia. These deals have valued Quikr at $1.5-1.6 billion. But Kinnevik had kept the valuation pegged to the last major investment round.

57,['18/02/2020'],Forensic issues may play spoilsport in DHFL’s sale,"This story is from February 18, 2020

(Representative image)

MUMBAI: While close to two dozen potential investors are looking at DHFL , which is up for sale in the insolvency process, sources said forensic issues will play spoilsport.

Private equity funds, financial services companies, asset reconstruction companies and a foreign bank are among those who are understood to have submitted an expression of interest under the insolvency process. Lenders are allowing buyers to either buy the entire company or parts. For those interested in the latter, the company’s business has been divided into three segments — retail loans, non-retail advances and slum rehabilitation project loans.

According to sources, allegations by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) that the company had created one lakh fake retail accounts to divert funds has turned investors wary. While buyers may not face regulatory actions for DHFL’s actions, banks are not offering any form of assurance or guarantee on the loans that they are selling.

Besides ED’s findings, there is a forensic report by KPMG that has cast doubts over some wholesale loans of DHFL. ED officials last week alleged DHFL had institutionalised fund diversion by creating a software that would transfer funds to fake borrower accounts.

Some big names that have shown interest include Oaktree’s India Opportunities Fund, Asset Reconstruction Company of India (Arcil), SC Lowy, Adani Properties, Deutsche Bank, Multiples Private Equity, Piramal Enterprises, Hero Fincorp, Lone Star, Edelweiss Financial Services, Kotak Investment Advisors, Phoenix ARC, and KKR. Nearly half the bidders have shown interest in the company, while the rest are looking at loan portfolios.

Despite the action by enforcement authorities and fund-diversion allegations, many banks that have lent to DHFL have not yet classified the loan account as a fraud. Most lenders said that they have ‘red-flagged’ the account.

According to RBI, a red-flagged account is one where a suspicion of fraudulent activity is thrown up by the presence of one or more early warning signals (EWS). “These signals in a loan account should immediately put the bank on alert regarding a weakness or wrongdoing that may turn out to be fraudulent. A bank cannot afford to ignore such EWS but must instead use them as a trigger to launch a detailed investigation,” RBI’s circular on fraud account had said.

SURAT: A 32-year-old jeweller ended life by hanging self in his shop here on Sunday. The jeweller in his suicide note said he was ending his life because of huge debt. Rajesh Savaliya, a resident of Laskana , was found hanging in Unique Jewellers at Shreenathji Shopping at Kapodra. He had used a rope to hang self from the ceiling fan in the shop. Police suspect Savaliya ended life between 1 and 7.30pm.

Savaliya wrote he doesn't know how to face his customers and friends from whom he took money for investment and that he was not in a position now to return it. Savaliya claimed that he got cheated as he had invested the money in some fraud schemes.

""It is suspected that Savaliya had floated some schemes promising good returns and that he used to receive small amounts from customers at regular intervals for investment. He must have invested the money in some other schemes and was cheated,” said a police officer at Kapodra police station.

KOLKATA: The district rounds of the West Bengal edition of Speak for India , the largest inter-college debate contest, has entered the home stretch with the completion of the 15th round at the Hazra Law College on Monday. Three more rounds will be held over the next three days.

The Federal Bank initiative, in association with The Times of India and Ei Samay, has attracted more than 1,000 students so far from around 700 colleges. Till now, 90 students have been shortlisted for the zonal rounds that will see around 120-130 debaters take each other on from February 19 to 22.

On Monday, 40 students from various colleges across the city participated in the district round. Initially, the participants were given a topic and asked to speak extempore, arguing their case within a minute. Speaking in English, Bengali and Hindi, the students exuded confidence and impressed the judges on topics that ranged from superstition to politics to sports.

The 28 students who moved to the next round had to debate on issues like the death penalty, reality shows, honking and drugs on campus. Each speaker had two-and-a-half minutes each to speak and 30 seconds to sum up. The 13 students judged the best will participate in the zonal debate.

The judges who marked the students on the basis of language and speech, understanding of the topic, argument structure, points and examples that they argued, body language and presentation, said it was a tough task to eliminate the students who spoke confidently and argued with passion.

“Of the 120-130 that will advance to the zonal round, around 25-30 will advance to the semi-final scheduled on March 5. Of them, only 8 will go up to the final round that will be held on March 6,” an organizer said.

After the zonal rounds, speakers will be able to individually campaign and drum up support for themselves, both in their colleges and on social media. The votes cast will help one of them win the title of the most popular debater, who will get Rs 1.5 lakh. The runner-up will receive Rs 1 lakh and the other finalists will get Rs 25,000 each.

60,['18/02/2020'],Kisan Rail to benefit Bihar farmers: Union minister,"This story is from February 18, 2020

PATNA: Union minister of state for agriculture and farmer welfare Kailash Choudhary on Monday said the Centre would soon prepare the road map to launch Kisan Rail project across the country, which would also benefit farmers of Bihar.

“The Centre is committed to launching the Kisan Rail project. It was also mentioned in the Union Budget. The road map will be prepared soon,” Choduhary said, adding it would also benefit those practising organic farming.

The Kisan Rail will help in transporting perishable agriculture produce to the markets in time, and thereby ensure increased monetary returns to the farmers on their produce, he said. “It is part of the bigger objective to increase the farmers’ income by 2022,” Choudhary told media persons at the state BJP headquarters here.

Choudhary, who also addressed a rally of farmers at Samastipur earlier in the day, said the Centre has already decided to promote organic farming along 5km stretch on the banks of the Ganga under the Namami Gange project, which, in turn, would make the Kisan Rail scheme viable, as farmers would access and use the Kisan Rails to send their perishable agricultural produce to the urban markets of their choice in time. “It will certainly help the Bihar farmers also,” he added.

Incidentally, the state government has already introduced organic farming of vegetable items along the Ganga in 12 districts, which has been christened as Organic Corridor and is linked to the rail network on both the sides of the river. Further, the farmers willing to go for the organic farming of vegetable items are being given input subsidy.

Choudhary said the farmers would also be helped by eNAM, an online trading platform to access National Agriculture Market and discover prevailing suitable price for agricultural produce in the country.

In the 2020-21 Union Budget, finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced provision for agricultural produce storage facilities for which godowns will be constructed at a cost of Rs 2 crore each, Choudhary said, adding the farmers would be able to stack their produce at the godowns. “By tracking the agriculture commodity price through eNAM, they will be able sell their produce at desired prices,” the minister added.

He said the Centre has made budgetary allocation of Rs 1.50 lakh crore for promoting agricultural and allied activities, besides creating infrastructural support. “It has been the highest allotment made so far. Before 2014, the allocations made in the Union Budget for agriculture and allied activities never exceeded Rs 30,000 crore,” he added.

61,['18/02/2020'],NHAI waives FASTag fee till Feb 29 to encourage device use,"This story is from February 18, 2020

PATNA: In a bid to encourage the use of electronic toll collection device FASTag, the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) has waived the fee for issuing tags till February 29. While the adoption fee of Rs100 has been waived off, motorists still have to pay the security fee and minimum balance for getting FASTag.

The radio frequency identification (RFID) tag facility, which is mandatory for driving vehicles on national highways, can be availed from point-of-sale locations at toll plazas, regional transport offices (RTOs) and online.

“In order to increase digital collection of user fee via FASTag at national highway toll plazas, the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) has decided to waive off the FASTag fee of Rs 100 from February 15 and 29, 2020,” a statement issued by the ministry of road transport and highways on February 12 reads.

However, the number of people using FASTags have increased. Sanjeev Kumar, toll plaza manager at Patna-Bakhtiyarpur NH-30 said, “The number of motorists issuing FASTags has increased in the last 15 days. Around 50% of vehicles passing through the toll plaza have FASTags sticked on their windscreen. Earlier only 30-40% vehicles that passed through the toll plaza had the tags. Besides, the number of private vehicles with RFID tag is comparatively higher than commercial and heavy vehicles, including trucks.”

He added: “Around 80-90 motorists issue FASTags on a daily basis. People are eventually understanding the benefits of the tags. With FASTags they don’t just experience a seamless travel but they save a lot of time too.”

Meanwhile, several motorists claimed of having issues with banks owing to the issuance of FASTags. “The initiative of making FASTags mandatory is very good. However, NHAI should give a complaint number to us in case we face issues while getting the tags. I issued the tag long back but I am yet to receive it,” said Nishant, a resident of Kankarbagh.

Sharing similar problems, Sanket Raj of Boring Road said, “I applied for FASTag via my bank as they were issuing it for free but it has been 15 days and there are no updates.�

PATNA: ‘Bihar Sadan’, a swanky 12-storey new guest house of the state government in Delhi will be ready in next four months, a senior government official told CM Nitish Kumar here on Monday.

Coming up on a two-acre plot in Dwarka Sector-19 area, Bihar Sadan will be third guest house of the state government in the national capital after two existing houses – Bihar Bhavan and Bihar Niwas.

“Construction work on Bihar Sadan is going on at a fast pace. It will be completed in the next four months,” state’s building construction department (BCD) principal secretary Chanchal Kumar said while making a presentation before the CM on re-development plan of the existing Bihar Bhavan and Bihar Niwas. The presentation was made at a high-level meeting held at Sankalp hall in the CM’s official residence here.

BCD minister Ashok Choudhary, who also attended the meeting, said the CM directed construction companies to hand over Bihar Sadan to the state government in next three/four months. “It will be ready in next four months,” Choudhary said.

Being constructed at a cost of Rs 78.78 crore, the new building will have 10 floors besides basement and ground floor. It will have 118 rooms, a conference room for 200 people and cafeteria for 180 people. It will also have an exhibition area for 200 people and parking facility for 224 vehicles. Of 118 rooms, there will be eight VIP suites, two VVIP suites, 89 double bedrooms and 19 single bedrooms.

“Once completed, it will provide accommodation to dignitaries from the state, including the governor, CM, ministers, legislators, high court judges, state government and guests from other places,” a BCD official told TOI.

After reviewing the presentation on the re-development plan of the two existing guesthouses, Nitish asked the BCD officials to focus on renovation of Bihar Niwas in the first phase. He advised the officials to construct an auditorium on the premises of Bihar Niwas.

“Under the redevelopment plan, there should be enough provision for residential accommodation of the officers and employees working at the Bihar Niwas on the same premises. It will be better if we can make arrangement on a fixed rate for common people who visit Delhi for treatment at different hospitals,” Nitish told the officials.

He asked the officials to prepare a better draft plan after studying designs of other important buildings. “Senior officials should visit the location time to time to ensure that renovation work is executed in a better way,” Nitish said.

He further asked the officials to spare certain portions of Bihar Bhavan to accommodate Delhi-based offices of the state government.

State’s chief secretary Deepak Kumar, cabinet secretariat department’s principal secretary Deepak Prasad and the secretaries to the CM Manish Kumar Verma and Anupam Kumar also attended the meeting.

Surat: Four years after Shree Tapagachchiya Shraman Sammelan in Palitana of Bhavnagar district, 36 monks from 18 different Jain sects are meeting at Guru Ram Pavan Bhoomi at Pal in Surat to review the resolutions they had taken, their implementations and future plans.

In the Palitana convention, Jain monks had passed over 40 resolutions providing guiding directives to the monks, nuns and followers of Jainism.

According to the Jain leaders, the-three-day important sammelan that began on Monday would discuss main issues of Jainism and monks.

In 2016, it was for the first time in the recent history that 18 sects of Shwetambar Jainism had come together to discuss the common issues. More than 2,500 monks and nuns had participated in the event in which thousands of devotees from India and abroad were present.

“Now, this three-day mega event has been convened to review those resolutions, its implementations and future plans. Among those to be present in the event include Abhaydevsuri Maharaj and Dolatsagarsuri Maharaj. Acharya of all the 18 sects along with the Jain leaders are going to be present at the event,’’ Shrenik Vidani, a Jain leader from Surat, told TOI.

During the Palitana meet, some of the resolutions included stopping unnecessary pomp at religious events, providing extra care to the ancient religious places, but refraining from unnecessary revamp, focusing on Jain teachings at schools, constituting educational and research institutes for Jainism to identify ancient Jain pilgrim spots, motivating more from the religion to assume public roles, providing alternative to the idols kept in areas where Jains no longer live, no construction of new tirtha on highways and using technology for digitizing information from various scripture repositories in India.

The meet had also unanimously decided to abolish the current custom of bringing the body of a monk, sadhvi or acharya to a specific place for the last rites. It was decided that the acharya would perform the last rites at the nearest place, reducing the use of vehicles for transport.

“It was felt that all those resolutions passed in Palitana meet four years ago should be reviewed and the status of its implementations and future plans should be discussed,” added Shrenik Vidani.

Bengaluru: Oyo Hotels and Homes has said its consolidated losses — including global operations — grew over sixfold to $335 million (Rs 2,390 crore) for the fiscal ending March 2019 as it expanded outside India at a breakneck pace, especially China.

The Gurgaon-based startup, which is backed by Japan’s SoftBank, said its India market loss stood at $83 million (Rs 592 crore), while it contributed about 63% to the total revenue of the company at $604 million (Rs 4,308 crore). This further shows its international expansion was the main factor for the ballooning losses overall.

The company said its total 2018-19 revenue is $951 million (Rs 6,784 crore), showing a growth of 4.5 times compared to the previous year. For the last one year, Oyo has been expanding across the US, China and Europe. India and China are its largest markets.

Both Rohit Kapoor , Oyo’s CEO for India and South Asia, and Aditya Ghosh , now a board member of Oyo, told reporters the company is working towards a “clear path to profitability”. China, which is its largest market, is also fighting the novel Coronavirus crisis and it has impacted its business there.

Ghosh did not comment on the impact on bookings and said that it’s a developing situation. “Absolutely there will be an impact, maybe for the short term. If I zoom out a little bit on our business in China, our business has grown and as the market matures, we expect to continue to reduce our losses, improve revenues and move towards a path to profitability (in China),” he added.

According to a blog post, Oyo saw almost $200 million (Rs 1,427 crore) of losses in China over revenues of $307 million (Rs 2,190 crore) for the year ending March 2019. Oyo did not give its room inventory country-wise, but said it now has over a million rooms across the world.

The focus on profitability comes at a time when Oyo’s model has come under severe scrutiny across the globe following SoftBank-backed WeWork’s failed IPO attempt, which also disclosed several governance issues in the company. Large startups, across the world, are seeing investors demanding more answers on their plans to be profitable and not just grow at any cost. Oyo has also been facing unrest of hotel owners over issues like payments, both in India and China.

“Revenue in India in the fiscal 2019 went up to $604 million from $210 million (Rs 1,498 crore) a year ago. The gross margin has moved up to over 14% from more than 10%,” Kapoor said, citing growth in India business.

Mumbai: Self-regulation is a key factor in greater responsibility, integrity, and accountability for rebuilding and sustaining trust, for companies, according to CII .

If India is to move to a leadership position in the global corporate space, business strategies can only be effective if complemented with responsible governance and ethical actions, it says.

It feels this is time to review the earlier Desirable Corporate Governance Code 1998, and recommend updated guidelines on integrity and transparency in governance.

The CII guidelines are an attempt to serve as the base for corporates (large and small; listed and unlisted) to redesign their governance strategies in the face of ever-changing business and regulatory environment. The guidelines enumerate 15 recommendations on topical issues covering integrity, ethics and governance; responsible governance and citizenship; role of high-performing board; balancing interest of stakeholders; independent directors and women directors; safe harbours for independent directors; easier settlement norms and amnesty provisions; risk management; succession planning; role of the audit committee; improving audit quality, and enhancing accountability of other third parties who play a fiduciary role; disclosure and transparency related issues; vigil mechanism; stakeholder, vendor and customer governance; investor activism and startups and MSMEs.

These guidelines are a combination of global practices; existing legal provisions (some of which may currently be applicable only to listed companies); good-to-have principles; regulatory policy suggestions and forward-looking concepts — aimed at enhancing the overall governance standards of companies in India.

70,['18/02/2020'],One in four heart-ailment patients in Kolkata under 40,"Representative image

KOLKATA: Around a fourth of the city’s heart patients is now aged below 40 and nearly 10% of them don’t survive their first heart attack , often due to late intervention, according to senior cardiologists. It still takes around 60 to 90 minutes for a heart-attack patient to be transferred to a cathlab table for a life-saving primary angioplasty at the city’s private hospitals. Experts felt that more lives can be saved if this time is reduced.At BM Birla Heart Research Centre — which celebrated its 30th anniversary on Monday — a process has been activated to reduce the ‘door-to-balloon time’ or the time taken to open a cardiac patient’s blocked artery from the moment of arrival. Around 90% of heart-attack patients seeking treatment at the hospital are now treated at the cathlab within 40 minutes.“We have multiple teams to expedite the process of treatment once a cardiac patient reaches our doorstep. From the managers at the desk to the lift operator, barber, nurses and doctors, everyone makes sure that the patient’s family doesn’t have to stand in queue for the admission formalities. The moment it is decided that a patient needs angioplasty, we activate the code ‘heart attack’ and everyone involved in the process makes sure that not a second is wasted,” said interventional cardiologist at BM Birla Anjan Siotia.It is now possible to carry out a primary angioplasty within half-an-hour of the patient being brought in, said Medica Superspecialty Hospital’s head of cardiac surgery Kunal Sarkar. “Most private hospitals have the infrastructure and the personnel to do it. It is indeed a life-saver,” he said.AMRI Hospitals, one of the first to introduce primary angioplasty in the city, claimed that its ‘door-to-balloon’ time is 70-75 minutes. “According to US guidelines, it should be less than 90 minutes. We have managed to bring it down to 70. But often, a lot of time is wasted since patients’ families have to be convinced about the necessity of the procedure,” said AMRI Hospital’s head of department of cardiology P K Hazra.Along with dietary habits, diabetes and smoking, stress has emerged as the leading cause of heart attack, especially among the youth. We have at least a couple of patients in their twenties every now and then, which would be very rare a decade back. Every month, we receive two-five patients in their thirties, which is a significant number as well,” Siotia said.Young cardiac patients are likely to suffer a more lethal heart attack and their chances of survival were lower than elderly patients, pointed out an interventional cardiologist with a private hospital.“You wouldn’t suspect a heart ailment in your thirties and will be more reckless about your diet and lifestyle. Few go for health check-ups, so diabetes and cholesterol often remain undetected. More importantly, a young patient does not develop collateral blood circulation — flow of oxygenated blood that bypasses blockages in the main artery and allows cardiac tissues to survive — which often saves the lives of chronic, elderly patients,” he said.",kolkata,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74183999,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-61089,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/one-in-four-heart-ailment-patients-in-city-under-40/articleshow/74181628.cms
71,['18/02/2020'],"Four lakh contractual teachers go on strike in Bihar, face action for skipping exam duty","This story is from February 18, 2020

Representative image

PATNA: Approximately four lakh ‘Niyojit’ (contractual) teachers of government schools in the state went on an indefinite strike from Monday in support of their eight-point demands, including equal pay for equal work.

The strike, which has been organised under the banner of the Bihar Rajya Shikshak Sangharsh Samanvay Samiti (BRSSSS) coincided with the beginning of the Matriculation exams conducted by the Bihar School Examination Board (BSEB). However, the government claimed that the teachers’ protest had no adverse impact on the exams.

Education department additional chief secretary R K Mahajan told TOI, “The government had made it clear that tough action will be taken against those who boycott the examination duty. Their salaries will also be deducted.”

Mahajan also instructed all the district magistrates, municipal commissioners, deputy development commissioners and district education officers to prepare a list of the teachers, who are boycotting examination duty, disturbing others or creating hurdles in the process of answer sheet evaluation, and lodge an FIR against them. He had written a similar letter on February 7 as well.

“The strike has not had any impact as we had roped in permanent teachers, contractual teachers of senior secondary schools and old teachers recruited before 2006 for conducting the examinations,” Mahajan claimed.

Education minister Krishna Nandan Prasad Verma condemned the teachers’ protest and called it unfortunate. “Exams are important for shaping children’s careers. It is unfortunate that teachers have gone on strike at this time. We cannot fulfil their demands because we are abiding by the Supreme Court order,” Verma said.

On the other hand, teachers, who have gone on strike, warned the government of dire consequences if their demands were not fulfilled. They also claimed that academic activities could not be carried out in 76,000 government schools on Monday.

In a press release, BRSSSS convener Brajnandan Sharma stated, “We will continue with our strike until our demands are fulfilled. Any punitive action against a teacher supporting us will make our movement more aggressive.”

One of the members of the BRSSSS (Patna), Prem Chandra, alleged that the education department had sought the help of nursing staff and Anganwadi workers for conducting the examinations.

72,['18/02/2020'],Bihar Assembly Elections 2020: Prashant Kishor likely to reveal Bihar assembly election plans today,"This story is from February 18, 2020

Prashant Kishor

PATNA: All eyes will be on poll strategist Prashant Kishor who is expected to make an announcement about his plans for assembly elections in the state here on Tuesday.

Kishor’s political advocacy group I- PAC has its fully functional office in Patna and media persons have been informed that he will address a press conference at 11am on Tuesday.

Those in the know said Kishor would not associate himself with any political party in Bihar as poll strategist. He, however, did not confirm to a query raised by TOI in this regard through a text message on Monday. “Will talk about it formally when I meet media in Patna at 11am on Tuesday,” he replied to the query.

Speculations are rife about Kishor’s future course of action. It is still unclear whether he will associate himself with any opposition party in the state or strengthen his forum for youths. The forum, ‘Youth in Politics (YIP)’, has 2,38,054 members from Bihar, if its official website is anything to go by. YIP’s website states that it is a first-of-its-kind pan-India platform for youth between 18 to 35 years of age to join active electoral politics under the mentorship of Prashant Kishor and I-PAC.

I-PAC handled Narendra Modi's prime ministerial campaign in 2014 Lok Sabha elections and Nitish Kumar’s chief ministerial candidature in Bihar in 2015. Later, I- PAC worked for Congress in Uttar Pradesh assembly elections. It also worked for Jagan Mohan Reddy in Andhra Pradesh, Arvind Kejriwal in Delhi and Mamata Banerjee in West Bengal.

Before I-PAC started working with Reddy’s YSR Congress, Kishor was inducted into JD(U) in September 2018 and made party’s national vice-president a month later.

Though JD(U) national president Nitish had called Kishor “future of politics”, things came to such an extent between the two in little over a year that the latter was removed from JD(U) on January 29 on charges of crossing party lines by making statements against Nitish.

Kishor has been a staunch opponent of Citizenship (Amendment) Act, which was supported by JD (U). He is also against proposed National Register of Citizens.

Meanwhile, the state Congress and RJD functionaries have ruled out any talks with Kishor. Vikassheel Insan Party (VIP) founder Mukesh Sahni had claimed last week that most opposition parties in Bihar were in touch with Kishor.

PATNA: An impersonator was caught in Gaya and 50 students were expelled for using unfair means across the state on the first day of Matriculation examinations conducted by Bihar School Examination Board (BSEB) on Monday. Action was also taken against two magistrates in Nalanda district for dereliction of duty.

The BSEB issued a press release in the evening, saying the examinations were conducted peacefully across the state. To ensure fair examinations, the BSEB had prepared 10 different sets of question papers. BSEB chairman Anand Kishor visited some examination centres and instructed the officials on duty to be strict.

Altogether 15,29,393 candidates, including 7,83,034 girls, wrote science papers on the first day at 1,368 centres across the state. In Patna, the examinations were conducted at 74 centres.

Two magistrates face heat in Nalanda: Nalanda district magistrate Yogendra Kumar Singh ordered issuance of show cause notices against two magistrates – Mohit Kumar and Jayesh Kumar Sinha – after finding that students were communicating with one another in the examination halls. While Mohit was deputed at Biharsharif's Allama Iqbal College, Jayesh was on duty at Aadarsh High School. The DM also ordered removal of invigilators – Upendra Singh and Furqan Alam from Allama Iqbal College, Dayanand Mishra from Adarsh High School and Chanchala Kumari and Karuna Kumari from Nalanda College – for mismanagement.

Nalanda district education officer Manoj Kumar said of 47,689 examinees at 36 centres in the district, 1,189 did not take the examination and 11 were expelled for using unfair means.

Bagaha teachers wear black armbands: In spite of the strike called by contractual teachers, the Matriculation examinations were conducted peacefully in Bagaha. However, permanent teachers wore black armbands as mark of support to their contractual counterparts who were on strike.

Lathicharge in Motihari: Police resorted to mild lathicharge on the onlookers and some guardians near Prabhawati Gupta High School in Motihari after they tried to create trouble. Motihari SDM Priyranjan Raju reached the centre and brought the situation under control. The Matric examinations were conducted at 56 examination centres in East Champaran district. DM Raman Kumar said Section 144 had been promulgated near all examination centres.

49,561 write papers in Bhojpur: A 15-year-old examinee, Riya Kumari, came in contact with a live wire after returning from an examination hall.

Meanwhile 49,561 students appeared at 36 centres in the Matric examination in the Bhojpur district . District public relations officer Pramod Kumar said 103 magistrates, 80 police officers and a large number of police personnel were deployed at examination centres.

Fake question paper: Sitamarhi DM Abhilasha Kumari Sharma said the question paper doing rounds on social media was a fake one. A team headed by civil SDO Kumar Gaurav investigated and zeroed in on those involved in spreading the rumour.

No expulsion in Begusarai: The examinations passed off peacefully in Begusarai district. Begusarai district education officer Devendra Jha said no candidate was expelled in the district. He said the strike by niyojit teachers had no impact on the examinations.

PATNA: The Muzaffarpur police on Monday claimed to have cracked the case related to the murder of a 65-year-old retired officer of registration department, Ajay Kumar Sharma, and his wife Renu (60), following the arrest of their former domestic help, Nitesh Kumar.

The duo was found murdered with a blunt weapon at their residence under the Brahmpura police station area in Muzaffarpur on January 8. The murder of the elderly couple, stated to be close relatives of a senior IPS officer posted at the state police headquarters, had sent shock waves among the residents of the town.

Muzaffarpur city SP Niraj Kumar said Nitesh had confessed to the crime and revealed that he was furious after Renu misbehaved with him over some issue. “Although I had lost my job almost a year ago, I used to work in the house on certain occasions. The greed to make a fast buck coupled with misbehaviour compelled me to killed them,” he reportedly told the interrogators.

Nitesh had escaped with Rs 50,000 and the couple’s cellphone from the house. He disclosed that he purchased a motorbike for Rs 34,500 and spent the remaining amount on other articles. The bike and the stolen cellphone were seized from the possession of Nitesh.

The city SP told mediapersons, “Two suspects were, earlier, sent to jail in connection with the incident and Nitesh was under the surveillance of the special investigation team, headed by DSP Naresh Paswan. Police swung into action and arrested him as soon as evidences corroborating his involvement in the double murder case were found.”

Nitesh was produced before the local court, which remanded him to judicial custody for 14 days. “The investigating officer has been asked to take Nitesh on remand for further interrogation in the case. All the three accused will be quizzed again in the wake of fresh evidences,” the city SP added.

KANNUR: Rajeshwari was not his daughter but ever since the day she reached his home around 15 years back, after the death of her parents, she has been like his daughter. So, when she became a grown-up girl of marriageable age, Abdulla Abdurahiman, who is from Melparamba in Kasaragod, knew it was his duty to marry her off, that too as a Hindu , because she was born a Hindu.The girl, now 22, was married to Kanhangad native Vishnuprasad on Sunday, at a simple function at Manyottu temple in Kanhangad as per Hindu rituals, and Abdulla and wife were her parents at the function and were part of the rituals.“Her parents died when she was a little girl and I knew them well as her father Saravanan had worked in my home as well. So when Rajeshwari’s relatives brought her here, I received her just like my daughter and she grew up here only, with my three sons,” he said.Though Rajeshwari was not keen to go to school, she helped the family in all ways possible, said Abdulla, 68, who added that she was not a housemaid there. Even though her people took her to their native place in Thanjavur, she returned in a few months and never wanted to go home, he said.“I have not legally adopted her but she is a daughter for me and my wife Khadeeja right from the beginning, so we were happy to solemnize her marriage too, after a suitable bridegroom was identified,” he said.Vishnuprasad’s family wanted the marriage to be solemnized in a Hindu temple. But Abdulla and family were bit too tense, as they are Muslims and will not have entry to a Hindu temple. It was then somebody said Manyottu temple in Kanhangad permitted entry to Muslims and hence the marriage was solemnized there, he said. His three sons, 84-year-old mother Safiyumma, and also their relatives had attended the wedding.“I never thought of religion or faith and simply thought of her marriage, because it is my duty,” he said.",kozhikode,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74201514,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-955312,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kozhikode/muslim-man-marries-off-his-hindu-foster-daughter/articleshow/74198714.cms

Ravi Shankar Prasad

BIHARSHARIF: Union minister Ravi Shankar Prasad on Monday said the Centre was “inclined” to talk to those protesting against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) at Shaheen Bagh in Delhi to remove their “confusions,” but maintained at the same time that if they (protesters) have “other objectives”, action would be taken against them.

“The Centre is eager to talk to them and remove all their misgivings about the CAA, but the problem is you can awake a sleeping person, not the one who is pretending to sleep,” Prasad told reporters here.

“People have right to dissent, but they can’t be allowed to conspire to disintegrate the nation. Terrorists and separatists who are operating from behind to fuel the protests to weaken the nation will be defeated,” he added. “No person will be allowed to break Hindustan,” the minister said.

He said the “desperation” of terrorists and separatists became more visible after the BJP alone secured 303 seats in the general election held under the “dynamic leadership” of PM Narendra Modi in 2019. The minister, who represents Patna Sahib seat in Lok Sabha, said the BJP-led NDA government at the Centre has been constitutionally resolving long pending issues, such as Article 370, Ram Temple and Citizenship Act.

Describing the anti-CAA, NPR and NRC protests as “sponsored,” Prasad said the opposition parties were spreading lies and misinformation for their political gains.

“The CAA grants citizenship to persecuted minorities from certain countries. It in no way deprives any Indian of his or her citizenship as is being falsely claimed by the opposition parties and other vested interests,” Prasad said.

He said even the then Assam and Rajasthan CMs – Tarun Gogoi and Ashok Gehlot, respectively – had demanded implementation of CAA in their states when Manmohan Singh was the Prime Minister.

PUNE: Hundreds of old marksheets with holograms of secondary school certificate (std X) and higher secondary certificate (std XII) examinations were found strewn around in a room on the third floor of the Pune division office of the Maharashtra State Board of Secondary and Higher Secondary Education in Shivajinagar on Saturday afternoon.After the incident was brought to the notice of the state board chairperson, the marksheets were immediately disposed of as per the rules.These marksheets were those that had some faults and kept aside. Some had misprints or some defects with the cutting, some did not have the security hologram. Some of them were returned due to wrong names or seat numbers, among others and were kept aside.The room in which these marksheets were found lying around had no security. Moreover, there was no one to question people entering the building or visiting the third-floor room on Saturday afternoon. Shakuntala Kale , the chairperson of the state board, stated that the building was under renovation, but accepted that it was “careless” on part of the officials at the division to keep the marksheets lying around.Employers, colleges and universities often receive forged marksheets at the time of admission or employment. The third-floor room of the Pune division would have given miscreants an easy opportunity to lay hands on them and misuse them.Among paper scraps and several documents kept in the room on the third floor, the marksheets were found lying in carton boxes, some spilling out and lying on the floor.Kale said, ""These are discarded marksheets and since the renovation is underway, the officials may have kept them in the room. However, I admit that the process is not being followed and this is very dangerous. Immediate action has been taken by the divisional chairman after my calls and we will ensure that such carelessness is avoided in future.""The interiors of the building are under renovation and officials at the Pune division said that the paper scrap was being kept in a room and was to be taken up later for sorting.Pune division chairman BK Dahiphale admitted that the marksheets were very carelessly strewn around in the room.

PATNA: Academics, technocrats and industry professionals from different parts of the country highlighted the crucial role played by Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) in the economic development of the country on Monday. They pleaded for propagating its awareness in every section of the society.

Addressing a two-day national workshop on ‘IPR and Patents’ organized by the National Institute of Technology-Patna (NIT-P), they pointed out that in today’s globally competitive environment, intellectual property (IP) was becoming increasingly important. “It is the fuel that powers the engine of prosperity, fostering invention and innovation,” they added.

Experts like Pondicherry Engineering College’s faculty member and Institution of Engineers (India) chairman Raman Sarvanane, Council of Scientific and Industrial Research principal scientist R Sivacoumar, and Patents and Designs (Kolkata) deputy controller Parijat Saurabh said, “IPR is nothing, but a creative work of human mind and refers to the legal ownership of an invention or discovery by a person attached to a particular product. This right clearly protects the owner against unauthorized copying of his product.”

They pointed out that countries that protect intellectual property had higher economic growth rate.

Workshop convener L B Roy said, “In the modern era, the ability to translate knowledge into innovation and its subsequent commercialization will determine the future economy of the country.”

NIT-P deputy director S K Verma said the workshop was intended to increase the level of awareness about IPR and patents among the participants. College faculty member N S Maurya proposed the vote of thanks.

79,['18/02/2020'],Immunity cover to allow JSW takeover of Bhushan Power,"This story is from February 18, 2020

Reeba Zachariah | TNN

Mumbai: An appeals court on Monday allowed JSW Steel’s Rs 19,700-crore purchase of bankrupt Bhushan Power by offering it immunity from criminal proceedings in relation to offences committed by the target company’s previous management. However, prosecution against Bhushan Power’s erstwhile promoters can continue, the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal ( NCLAT ) said. The Bhushan Power transaction, when completed, will strengthen JSW’s position as the largest steel maker in the country with a capacity of 23 million tonnes.

JSW’s deal to acquire Bhushan Power ran into rough weather after the Enforcement Directorate (ED) seized the latter’s assets in connection with a money laundering probe against its founder. The steel major subsequently moved NCLAT, seeking immunity from all present and future liabilities arising from criminal proceedings against Bhushan Power, contending that the absence of such a protection will risk its acquisition. The Bhushan Power deal follows JSW’s recent buy of insolvent Monnet Ispat & Energy for Rs 3,700 crore.

The NCLAT bench led by Justice S J Mukhopadhaya also ruled that the operating profit earned by Bhushan Power during the insolvency period will go to JSW.

The judgment is in line with the recently amended insolvency law that protects a bankrupt company, after its resolution, from criminal liabilities arising from the acts of the founders. While investigative agencies can continue to probe wrongdoings of previous management, they cannot touch properties of companies that are under the insolvency process.

In the case of JSW-Bhushan Power, the ED had argued that the legal immunity introduced in December will not apply to JSW as it was prospective in nature. It also said that since JSW and Bhushan Power were once related — the two were strategic partners in Rohne Coal Company — the Sajjan Jindal-controlled metal major cannot take the legal immunity benefit under the amended insolvency law. The appellate tribunal bench, however, turned down these objections. Analysts said that JSW’s purchase of Bhushan Power could turn out to be expensive as the company’s debt rose even as demand for steel has been dipping amid an economic slowdown.

In a separate development, Jindal’s energy company has inked an agreement to acquire a 1,050MW thermal power plant in Odisha from GMR for Rs 5,321 crore. The transaction will ramp up JSW Energy’s capacity to 5,609MW and strengthen its presence in east India.

Hyderabad: Actor-turned-politician Nandamuri Balakrishna’s accountant was arrested on Monday for allegedly forging signatures of the MLA’s wife to activate mobile banking facility for their accounts.

Jubilee Hills police arrested K Shiva Kumar alias Shiva, 34, an assistant accountant with NBK Films LLP, Anna Nagar, Balamrai, Secunderabad, owned by actor-producer-MLA Balakrishna and his wife Vasundharadevi, for forging their signatures.

Shiva Kumar, 34, forged the signature of Vasundharadevi on HDFC Bank application form and submitted it to the bank asking for activation of the mobile banking feature, Jubilee Hills police said.

“The managers of HDFC Bank’s Banjara Hills branch, Phaneendra and Srinivas, contacted Vasundharadevi’s representative, V Subba Rao, on February 13 to enquire about the application furnished to activate mobile banking feature. Subba Rao and Vasundharadevi told bank officials that they had not applied for mobile banking. They also called Shiva Kumar and confronted him about submitting the application at the bank. Shiva confessed before his employers and also the bankers that he had forged the signature to download the app and easily check account balance and account statements instead of doing multiple rounds to the bank,” Jubilee Hills inspector Sattaiah said.

Based on the complaint lodged by Subba Rao, police registered a forgery case against Shiva Kumar under Sections 467, 468, 471 r/w 511 of the IPC. Shiva was arrested on Monday and produced before court. He was sent in judicial remand.

Shimla: Himachal Pradesh cabinet on Monday gave its approval to the 2020-21 excise policy, which envisages collection of Rs 1,840 crore revenue during the year, which is Rs 215 crore higher than the previous financial year.

Surat: Four members of the Surya Marathi alias Suresh Pawar gang were arrested on Monday for their alleged involvement in murder of their own gang leader in Chowk Bazaar last week.

Those arrested include Amul Jine, the complainant in Marathi murder case; Safi Shaikh, Munna Dudhwala alias Shukla and Vikas Magre.

Investigation revealed that the accused were in touch with Hardik Patel, former aide of Marathi, who had led the attack on Marathi on February 12. Police suspect bigger conspiracy behind Marathi's murder and involvement another gangster who is backed by those dealing in disputed properties.

Another member of Marathi's gang Jayesh Paul was also booked for Marathi’s murder. He is on the run.

Cops had earlier arrested Satish alias Satya alias Babu Marathi Dhagde and Rahul alias Apartment Piple on February 14. They are in police custody till February 20.

Marathi was stabbed to death at his office on Ved Road last week. Four others, who were part of the gang that attacked Marathi, are yet to be arrested.

Hardik, who had led the attack on Marathi was also killed during the counter attack by Marathi.

“The accused did not interfere or not even try to stop the attackers. Since day one their involvement was suspected and their call records show that they were in touch with the attackers,” said a police officer.

According to police, Amul and Safi were in contact with Hardik over phone.

The 50-second video from a CCTV footage shows security personnel breaking the door of the library and beating up students with batons.The attack on the students in Jamia turned out to be a significant turning point in anti-CAA movement, leading to several protests and sit-ins throughout the country against the new citizenship law which demonstrators have termed discriminatory and unconstitutional. “This is state-sponsored terrorism on students. The video exposes the lies by the Delhi Police and the home ministry, which had claimed that police never entered the library,” said Debabrata Sinha, a student of Presidency University where students have organized and participated in several anti-CAA protests in the past two months.The video, which has gone viral on social media, contradicts the police’s claim that they did not enter the Jamia library on December 15, the day protests against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act flared up leading to clashes in the Capital.“It is shocking how the security personnel are beating up the students. It only proves what we had been saying so far that the police entered the university library and rained batons on the students,” said Sunetra Samajpati, pursuing MPhil from Calcutta University.At least 90 students, residents and police personnel were injured in the December 15 clash, which began after officials refused anti-CAA protesters permission for a march. The police resorted to firing tear gas shells to disperse the protesters.Students of Aliah University have demanded action against the security personnel who entered the library.“We criticize the cowardly act of police beating up unarmed students.

KOLKATA: Jadavpur University vice-chancellor Suranjan Das has issued an appeal for cooperative and constructive harmony on the campus on the day of the union elections. In a signed letter, the VC also appreciated the efforts of the students for being on the forefront of various movements for social justice, awareness and equity.

ABVP has fielded candidates in the union elections for the first time — both in the engineering and humanities streams.

“It is a matter of pride how calm, peaceful and orderly the elections on the campus have been in the past. We have set an example for other institutions across the country. I am sure the same tradition of cooperative and constructive harmony will prevail and we will witness the peaceful and democratic exercise of their franchise by the students,” the VC wrote.

The election is due on Wednesday and the result will be announced on Thursday. More than 4,500 Arts students, around 2,400 science students and more than 700 engineering students will vote to elect 13 office-bearers. That apart, more than 600 class representatives will be elected as well.

Nobody could recall the last time a VC issued a plea for peaceful elections on campus. Last September, hundreds of JU students gheraoed Union minister Babul Supriyo on campus when he arrived to attend an ABVP programme. The students showed him black flags and raised slogans. Later, Governor Jagdeep Dhankhar drove to the campus and “rescued” the minister.

KOLKATA: The forum of vice-chancellors has thrown its weight behind the Coochbehar Panchanan Barma University vice-chancellor Debkumar Mukhopadhyay, who has been pulled up by governor Jagdeep Dhankhar, the chancellor of the state university, for not intimating him about the varsity’s third convocation that was held on February 14. Dhankhar’s predecessor Keshari Nath Tripathi had attended the second convocation.

Dhankhar served a show-cause notice on Mukhopadhyay for “seriously compromising the dignity and position of the chancellor”. The notice reached the VC hours before the convocation.

The Coochbehar university had told TOI they followed the government rules. Mukhopadhyay on Monday placed the issue in the West Bengal Vice-Chancellor’s Council meeting, where the members expressed concern over the notice, which arrived with a directive from Raj Bhavan that a reply must be sent within a fortnight. After the meeting, one of the members said, “We would like to submit that the state rules stipulate the procedure regarding conducting inquiry, issuing show-cause or taking any penal measures against VC and pro-VC.” “Panchanan Burma University VC Debkumar Mukhopadhyay had acted according to the new framed by the state government,” read a statement by the VCs. Jadavpur University VC Suranjan Das presided over the meeting.

JU VC was referring to the government rules that leave no scope for any direct communication between the chancellor and the VCs of state universities. Going by rules, VCs are to propose the convocation date to the higher education department, which might intimate the chancellor.

Dhankhar invoked Section 9 of Coochbehar Panchanan Barma University Act, 2012 that deals with removal of a VC. Some varsity officials wanted clarity. “But the rules are made in conformity with university Act. What happens when rules supplant relevant portions of Act?” an official said.

86,['18/02/2020'],"Two JD(U) legislators sing paeans to Tejashwi Yadav’s ‘yatra’, raise eyebrows","This story is from February 18, 2020

Tejashwi Yadav

PATNA: JD(U) MLC Javed Iqbal Ansari on Monday came out in support of the leader of opposition Tejashwi Prasad Yadav’s ‘Berozgaari Hatao Yatra’, describing it as a “welcome initiative” for highlighting the issue of unemployment and migration in the state.

Tejashwi has announced to begin his ‘yatra’ from the Veterinary College ground here on February 23 in an apparent bid to expand his party’s support base among youths ahead of the assembly elections in the state later this year.

“What is wrong if Tejashwi has planned to take out a ‘yatra’ to raise the issue of unemployment and migration? Today, unemployment is a burning issue in each family, each household, each caste and each social group in Bihar . I support Tejashwi’s ‘yatra’ while rising above the party line because he is raising a real issue,” Ansari, who was in his home district Banka on Monday, told TOI over phone.

He said Tejashwi’s ‘yatra’ has raised a ray of hope among lakhs of unemployed youths in the state.

Ansari, who recently called on incarcerated RJD chief Lalu Prasad at a Ranchi hospital to enquire about his health, even urged the JD(U) chief and CM Nitish Kumar to support Tejashwi’s ‘yatra’ by rising above the party line.

“Nitish Kumar ji should come forward and tell Tejashwi that he supports his yatra because it is being taken out for a genuine cause of youths. As all political parties in Bihar supported prohibition in the state, JD(U) chief should also support ‘Berozgaari Hatao Yatra’ and join hands with Tejashwi to exert political pressure on the Centre on the issue of unemployment,” Ansari said.

Ansari’s move to support to Tejashwi’s yatra caused ripples in the state’s political circles, especially in the ruling JD(U). JD(U) state president Bashishtha Narain Singh, however, tried to play down his party MLC’s support to the yatra. “There is no need to attach any importance to an individual’s support to Tejashwi’s yatra. It is just a tactic to gain publicity. It is not going to affect the JD(U) at all,” Singh told media persons.

Another JD(U) legislator, Hayaghat MLA Amarnath Gami, also expressed concern over unemployment and the state government’s failure to check migration of workers to other states, but he later clarified that he was not in support of Tejashwi’s yatra.

“No doubt, there is widespread unemployment in Bihar. Had there been no unemployment, people would not have left Bihar to work in other states. They are working in states like Maharashtra, Gujarat and Delhi despite facing humiliation there. No government in Bihar ever worked to address this issue of migration. All political parties will have to focus on the issue,” Gami told TOI over phone.

To a question on Tejashwi’s yatra, Gami said, “This gigantic problem will not be solved only by Tejashwi’s yatra. Tejashwi should inform people about the plans he has in mind to solve the problem.”

Gami also claimed that he was currently not associated with any political party. “I am a JD(U) member only in the assembly. I will follow the JD(U)’s line only in the legislative house. At other places, I have freedom of expression,” he said.

Representative image

PATNA: The skyrocketing prices of LPG cylinders are burning holes in the pockets of residents and food business owners in the city. The 14.2 kg subsidised cylinder is now priced at Rs965 in the city, which was Rs816 on January 1 this year. Similarly, the commercial LPG cylinder now stands at Rs1,670.

Homemakers are reeling from the hike in cylinder price which has increased exponentially over the past five months. “Onions, garlic, pulses, bread and now LPG; prices of everything are increasing. The government does not seem to be concerned at all about the common people. I am not able to manage my monthly budget,” said Smita Verma, a resident of Kankarbagh.

Kadamkuan resident Payal Kumari said, “The price of LPG cylinder has now gone beyond my reach. But I can’t even remove it from my kitchen as I won’t be able to cook without it.”

Amit Kumar, an LPG dealer in Hanuman Nagar, said, “LPG rates change on the first day of every month, however, due to the Delhi election it was postponed. Unlike every month, the increase isn’t of Rs30-Rs40 but of Rs149, which is quite expensive for most of the residents in the city.”

Restaurant owners, too, are at their wits end. “Unlike onions and garlic, we can’t replace LPG cylinders. In fact, 99% of the restaurants in the city use LPG cylinders for cooking. We can’t start cooking on coal all of a sudden,” said Rakesh Jaiswal, owner of a restaurant on Gola Road.

“I have decided to increase rates of food served at my restaurant due to the surge in LPG prices,” said the owner of a restaurant on Boring Road.

Market experts and the state-controlled oil marketing companies (OMC) in the city said prices of domestic as well as commercial cylinders change every month based on the international rate. “The prices have increased by more than Rs300 in the past six months. Last year in September, a 14.2kg LPG with subsidy was being sold at Rs684 and commercial 19kg cylinder was being sold at Rs1,271. The international market rates of LPG are quite high, due to which the prices have increased in India,” said Anita Kumari, the proprietor of an OMC in SK Puri.

She added, “Those who have already made the online booking, will also have to pay the revised amount. However, people who have made online payment prior to the increase in LPG prices won’t have to pay any extra amount.”

The arrested carriers were produced before Chandauli court on Monday and sent to jail.

Inspector GRP DDU Junction, R K Singh said, “Our team noticed two suspicious youths with three heavy backpacks on platform 2/3 during routine checking drive on Sunday afternoon. On checking of their bags, 24 pistols and 48 magazines were found.”

The two, identified as Jamaluddin and Saleem, residents of Bokaro, revealed during interrogation that they were involved in coal trade but had been recently called by a gang of arms smugglers to Hazaribagh for delivery of a consignment to someone in Moradabad, said Singth. After reaching DDU Junction, they were waiting to borad a train to Moradabad.

89,['18/02/2020'],Judiciary also to blame for HC vacancies: Govt,"This story is from February 18, 2020

NEW DELHI: It takes 337 days, or the better part of a year, on an average for appointment of a high court judge after a name is recommended by the HC collegium, attorney general K K Venugopal told the Supreme Court on Monday, arguing that the judiciary was equally responsible for 36% vacancies in HCs.

Detailing the timeline, Venugopal told a bench of Justices S K Kaul and K M Joseph, which is examining delays in appointment of HC judges, that on average the Centre took 127 days to decide on the list given by the HC and forward it to the SC collegium .

The collegium took 119 days to clear the names and the government thereafter took another 73 days to finalise the list which was then cleared by the Prime Minister and the President in 18 days. The break-up was based on the time taken for appointments in 2019.

Justifying the time taken by the Centre to forward the recommendations , the attorney general said the government had to collect information from state authorities and conduct an inquiry by the Intelligence Bureau before clearing names and asked why the SC collegium took almost the same time.

The sanctioned strength of judges in 25 HCs is 1,079 but the working strength, as on February 1, was 683. Some HCs like Patna and Rajasthan have more than 50% vacancies.

Venugopal said a major reason for huge vacancies was delay on part of HC collegiums in recommending names. As of now, no names have been forwarded by HCs for 199 out of 396 vacancies. He urged the SC to direct HCs to initiate the process of appointment one year before a vacancy arose and said explanation should be sought for delays. He told the bench that in many cases, HC collegiums sent recommendations more than five years after a vacancy arose.

Agreeing with the AG’s submission, the bench said, “Some introspection is required to be done on our part also and there has to be some administrative work mechanism... If we (judiciary) are not doing something, then we also need to push ourselves.”

It said the situation in some HCs was “alarming” and the chief justices of HCs must try to make recommendations as early as possible. Though the bench did not issue notice to HCs for delay in appointments, it directed registrar generals of HCs to file a report on vacancies or those likely to arise in the near future and when recommendations would be made by HCs for appointments.

As per the report filed by the AG, 80 proposals are pending with the SC collegium and 35 with the Centre. He said the SC collegium and the Centre were on the same page regarding 10 out of 35 proposals and there was a difference of opinion on 25 names.

90,['18/02/2020'],Bhim Army denied permission for protest at RSS’ doorstep,"This story is from February 18, 2020

Nagpur: The Bhim Army has been refused permission to hold a karyakarta melava (workers’ meet) at Reshimbagh Ground, adjoining the RSS’ Dr Hedgewar Smruti Mandir, on February 22. The Reshimbagh Ground has been the traditional site for RSS functions, including the annual Vijaya Dashami event, held to mark the organization’s foundation day.

The Vijaya Dashami meet is addressed by RSS Sarsanghchalak (chief) each year. The ground belongs to Nagpur Improvement Trust (NIT), and programmes can be held after securing the civic body’s approval and getting a police clearance. The Bhim Army’s application has been turned down by the police on the grounds that holding the event at Reshimbagh Ground can lead to a law and order situation.

The Bhim Army meet was supposed to be addressed by its chief Chandrashekhar Azad Ravan, who has been on the forefront in the anti-CAA-NRC movement, and was also barred from entering New Delhi.

The Bhim Army had secured approval from NIT, which was subject to police clearance, which was denied eventually. The programme has been organized in association with an outfit ‘We the citizens of India’, that had organized a series of anti-CAA-NRC agitations at Samvidhan Chowk in the city.

The RSS has been directly targeted during anti-CAA-NRC protests in the city, branding it as a fascist and pro-upper caste organization.

Bhim Army now plans to continue with its plans to hold the function at Reshimbagh, and court arrests after that, said its district chief Praful Shende, who had moved the application

Salman Ahmed of ‘We the people’ said the organization also plans to move court against denial of permission. Over 10,000 persons are estimated to turn up for the event, he said.

Shende, district chief of Bhim Army, said the ground was chosen because even the outfits’s office comes under the same area. “If we are not allowed to hold a function there, the police should also issue a list of organizations that should be barred from Reshimbagh,” he said.

Shende said, “The programme will be basically a membership drive. Pamphlets will be issued urging people to join Bhim Army and there will also be a mention about the organization’s stance on CAA and NRC. It also depends on what the speakers choose to talk about during the event,” he said.

Apart from Ravan, his lawyer Mohammed Pracha will also be one of the speakers, said Shinde.

An official at Kotwali police station, where the application for permission was put up, said the permission was denied because the Reshimbagh Grounds cannot be allotted for purposes like holding protests.

91,['18/02/2020'],"After long delay, NMC set to hold hearings for tree felling","This story is from February 18, 2020

Nagpur: For the third consecutive time, the Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) has not taken the mandatory public hearing regarding objections against tree felling. Officials had said that hearings will soon be held in the city on the objections received against tree felling at Empress Van and for Smart City Project roads.

According to the Maharashtra (Urban Trees) Protection and Preservation of Trees Act which was passed by the state government in 1975 and amended in 2017, a public hearing on objections should be conducted and a decision be given within two weeks.

The act states, “If any objection is received against permission for tree felling, the matter shall be placed before the tree authority for reconsideration. A decision should be taken within two weeks after giving a hearing to the person who has raised objection.”

TOI had earlier reported that despite record-breaking objections against tree felling at Bharat Van, the civic body did not take any public hearing. Similar objections were filed opposing felling of hundreds of trees at Empress Van and recently for Smart City Project roads.

While activists are slamming the civic body for not holding the hearing, officials from NMC’s garden department said that it will soon be conducted. “We don’t need to hold a meeting for Bharat Van case as the authorities have dropped the plan to construct the road. However, we have received objections for Empress Van and Smart City and we plan to hold hearings for both the cases soon,” said NMC garden superintendent Amol Chorpagar.

Over 800 objections were filed to oppose the construction of road via Empress Mill land. Following a recent public announcement regarding chopping down of 139 trees for Smart City Project roads, people from different fields came together to submit objection letters. This was the third time when citizens filed mass objections against destruction of green cover.

Officials informed that apart from a few small-scale hearings, the civic body has not yet held a hearing based on mass objections.

As per the rules, NMC gives a public notice in local newspapers regarding permission giving for felling, even if a single tree is to be cut. Citizens have the right to object against any permission given to tree felling which are placed before the tree authority for reconsideration.

Apart from newspapers, NMC is now displaying similar information on its website too. “We are in the process of updating latest permissions on the official website,” said Chorpagar.

92,['18/02/2020'],"1,300 BSNL employees opt for VRS in Pune district","This story is from February 18, 2020

PUNE: Of the total 2,000 BSNL employees in the district, 1,300 have opted for the voluntary retirement scheme, which the Union government had launched in October last year as a part of the five-pronged revival package for the public telecom firm.

“We are functioning at slightly more than 25% staff, due to which some operational issues are being faced. However, we have already undertaken redistribution of staffers to streamline operations. All of the 38 customer service centres in Pune district are functional. We are also working on outsourcing certain tasks to improve services,” Sandeep Sawarkar , principle general manager, Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited (BSNL) Pune, said.

Addressing a news conference in the city on Monday, Arvind Vadnerkar , director for human resources, BSNL Board, New Delhi, said, “With the voluntary retirement scheme (VRS), one step of the revival plan has been completed. Across the country, of the 1.49 lakh employees, 1.02 lakh were over 50 years of age and eligible for VRS. Out of this, 78,000 people opted for VRS across all classes of employees. Another 6,000 employees are between 59 years and 60 years and will retire soon. All this will bring down our spent on salaries by Rs 7,200 crore annually.”

Vadnerkar said the funds saved after the mass VRS would be diverted towards other schemes and issues. “The Centre had promised 4G spectrum for BSNL under the revival package. We will be allotted the spectrum in April this year and the 4G services will be available across the country by October. Money saved from salaries will be used towards the 4G infrastructure,” he said.

Speaking about non-payment of electricity bills of BSNL exchanges that led to disconnection of services to thousands of customers, Sawarkar said, “The funds saved from salaries will now be used to clear pending electricity bills and improving infrastructure.”

Vadnerkar also cleared the air pertaining to rumours about the government’s plan to sell the state-owned telecommunications provider. “The news of BSNL being sold off is only a rumour. Through the revival package, the government only wants to make BSNL a profitable and self-sustaining entity,” he added.

93,['18/02/2020'],Lawyers protest Justice Haq’s shifting with white bands,"This story is from February 18, 2020

Nagpur: Over 500 lawyers participated in protests against sudden transfer of Justice Zaka Haq to Aurangabad bench terming it “humiliation” of entire legal fraternity in the city. They tied white bands on their coats in the first session till lunch. However, the protests also brought out faction fight within High Court Bar Association (HCBA) with some lawyers questioning whether Association’s consent was taken.

These differences led to war of words between protesters and HCBA office-bearers. The latter stated protests were organized by a “group of lawyers” in individual capacity and HCBA executive body had not consented for them. “We haven’t received any demand (for support) from them,” HCBA secretary Prafulla Khubalkar told TOI. He added the much-awaited HCBA polls would be held on April 3 and new body would be announced the same day.

Noted lawyer Shreerang Bhandarkar, who led the protests, questioned HCBA office-bearers’ role in denying support to protests while claiming that their term had ended on February 10 after completion of three years tenure. “The last HCBA polls were held on February 10, 2017. The current body is now defunct as per the HCBA constitution and, therefore, their consent is not required. It is not important on which date the body assumed charge, as they can take it even after a year. The rules are same like what happens in general and assembly elections where tenure is calculated from the date of actual polling,” he told TOI.

Another lawyer Adil Mirza said there was no provision for caretaker or ad hoc body in HCBA rules and, therefore, the current body led by president Gauri Venkatraman, vice-president Purushottam Patil and Khubalkar, was only in name.

Khubalkar on the other hand asserted that since the executive took charge on April 14, 2017, their tenure would end only after two months and till then, they would be functioning as full-fledged body with all powers. “We are working as per HCBA rule book, which says our tenure would commence from the day of assuming charge and not that of election date. How can they say that we’re defunct,” he asked. Asked for comment Venkatraman said she would call back but did not.

The protesting lawyers added they would continue their protests in same way after a break. “Next week, we plan to approach new chief justice with a request to stop Justice Haq’s transfer. The new incumbent would most probably be Justice Bhushan Dharmadhikari, who is currently the senior most judge in Mumbai after resignation of Justice Satyaranjan Dharmadhikari. With just a couple of months left for former’s retirement, he may get the top post like Justice Naresh Patil,” they told TOI.

94,['18/02/2020'],Bhim Army denied permission for protest at RSS’ doorstep,"This story is from February 18, 2020

Nagpur: The Bhim Army has been refused permission to hold a karyakarta melava (workers’ meet) at Reshimbagh Ground, adjoining the RSS’ Dr Hedgewar Smruti Mandir, on February 22. The Reshimbagh Ground has been the traditional site for RSS functions, including the annual Vijaya Dashami event, held to mark the organization’s foundation day.

The Vijaya Dashami meet is addressed by RSS Sarsanghchalak (chief) each year. The ground belongs to Nagpur Improvement Trust (NIT), and programmes can be held after securing the civic body’s approval and getting a police clearance. The Bhim Army’s application has been turned down by the police on the grounds that holding the event at Reshimbagh Ground can lead to a law and order situation.

The Bhim Army meet was supposed to be addressed by its chief Chandrashekhar Azad Ravan, who has been on the forefront in the anti-CAA-NRC movement, and was also barred from entering New Delhi.

The Bhim Army had secured approval from NIT, which was subject to police clearance, which was denied eventually. The programme has been organized in association with an outfit ‘We the citizens of India’, that had organized a series of anti-CAA-NRC agitations at Samvidhan Chowk in the city.

The RSS has been directly targeted during anti-CAA-NRC protests in the city, branding it as a fascist and pro-upper caste organization.

Bhim Army now plans to continue with its plans to hold the function at Reshimbagh, and court arrests after that, said its district chief Praful Shende, who had moved the application

Salman Ahmed of ‘We the people’ said the organization also plans to move court against denial of permission. Over 10,000 persons are estimated to turn up for the event, he said.

Shende, district chief of Bhim Army, said the ground was chosen because even the outfits’s office comes under the same area. “If we are not allowed to hold a function there, the police should also issue a list of organizations that should be barred from Reshimbagh,” he said.

Shende said, “The programme will be basically a membership drive. Pamphlets will be issued urging people to join Bhim Army and there will also be a mention about the organization’s stance on CAA and NRC. It also depends on what the speakers choose to talk about during the event,” he said.

Apart from Ravan, his lawyer Mohammed Pracha will also be one of the speakers, said Shinde.

An official at Kotwali police station, where the application for permission was put up, said the permission was denied because the Reshimbagh Grounds cannot be allotted for purposes like holding protests.

Varanasi: Adding one more festival to the list of events hosted by Kashi tourism department every year, Mahashivratri Mahotsava will be celebrated for four days on a grand scale in the Shiva’s abode. The festival is falling on February 21 this year.

Tourism department, which spends over Rs one crore on Ganga Mahotsava and organises Budhwa Mangal, will spend around Rs 50 lakh on four-day Mahashivratri Mahotsava commencing from February 20. Apart from several cultural and literary events, boat-race and boat fest will remain prime attraction on the concluding day of the fest.

Ganga Mahotsava is organised between Prabodhini Ekadashi and Kartik Purnima in November.

Nashik: The Mhasrool police have arrested a 21-year-old youth on charges of abetting the suicide of an 18-year-old girl from the Mhasrool area.

The Mhasrool police said the youth was arrested following a complaint lodged by the girl’s father.

Investigating officer API Shivaji Ahire, of the Mhasrool police station, said the girl had committed suicide in August 2019. The girl had consumed poison and died while undergoing treatment at a private hospital.

The viscera of the deceased girl was preserved for further examination to ascertain the exact cause of death. The report arrived recently and revealed that she had consumed poison.

The girl’s father then lodged a complaint against the suspect, who is from the Gangawadi area of Makhmalabad. In his FIR, the father said the suspect often used to call up his daughter on her cellphone and harass/threaten her to marry him.

Frustrated with this constant harassment, the girl allegedly took the extreme step by consuming some poisonous substance. The girl was rushed to a private hospital after the incident came to notice, but she did not respond to the treatment and died.

The police said the girl had not left any suicide note behind. However, her father was aware that his daughter was being harassed by the youth.

API Ahire said the deceased girl and the suspect’s sister were friends. The suspect and the victim had met at a wedding ceremony after which he started harassing her to marry him.

The police said the girl’s father is a worker. The suspect also used to take up temporary jobs. Soon after the complaint was lodged, the police arrested the suspect on Monday.

Nashik: The Nashik police have decided to step up action against petrol pump dealers selling fuel in cans or bottles.

Nashik city police commissioner Vishwas Nangare-Patil said they would issue a notice to all petrol pump dealers warning of strict legal action if the fuel is found to have been sold in the open.

At the same time, Nashik rural superintendent of police Arti Singh also said that she would be conducting a meeting of petrol and diesel dealers.

The rural police have decided to recommend suspension or cancellation of the petrol pump licence if the dealers concerned are found selling the fuel to customers in their bottles and cans.

On February 15, a 40-year-old woman from Lasalgaon sustained serious burns after she was accidentally set ablaze — during a scuffle with a youth with whom she was in a relationship. The woman had bought petrol in a bottle and kept in her two-wheeler.

The woman was carrying a can of petrol when the altercation took place.

The police have managed to get hold of the CCTV footage of the petrol pump from where she had bought the fuel before the incident.

In view of this incident, Singh said the rural police would issue strict instructions to the petrol pump dealers against selling the fuel in loose. “We have called a meeting of all petrol pump dealers and officials of the state owned oil marketing companies on Monday to instruct them about the hazards of selling the fuel in loose. If they are still found selling fuel on the loose, we will recommend suspension or cancellation of their licence.”

Nangare Patil said, “It is prohibited to sell diesel and petrol in bottles or cans. On the backdrop of the recent incident, we will issue a notice under section 144 of Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC) to petrol pump dealers to do away with the practice of selling petrol or diesel in loose. There is a provision of legal action if instructions under section 144 of the CrPC are violated.”

Earlier this month, a 24-year-old woman lecturer of Hinganghat in Wardha district was allegedly set afire when she was on her way to college. She later succumbed to her injuries at a hospital in Nagpur on February 10.

The customs officials with the recovered gold on Sunday

PUNE: Customs officials nabbed a woman carrying 642 gram of gold worth Rs 20 lakh in semi-solid paste form at the Lohegaon airport on Sunday.

The woman, identified as Mariyam Mohammed Salim Sheikh of Mumbai, was found carrying the gold carefully concealed inside three capsules in her rectum, Pune customs officials said.

“The woman was intercepted by the team on the basis of intelligence reports and inputs. She had come to Pune from Dubai on a SpiceJet flight (SG52), which landed at the Lohegaon airport at 4am on Sunday. After the due process and assistance of the medical team, the gold paste was found concealed in her rectum,” a customs official said.

The customs officials said the woman seemed to be a wilful carrier. “The three capsules were covered in black adhesive tape and contained gold in semi-solid paste. In total, 642g of gold worth Rs 20 lakh has been recovered from her,” the official said.

“Further investigations under the Customs Act 1962 is under progress in the case. We appeal all passengers to report to us of any suspicious person/s and baggage at the Pune airport . Body concealment of contraband material is the most risky, painful and fatal for the one carrying it. Though Pune has less direct international flights now, the alertness level is the same,” the official said.

In a similar recovery, the customs officials had arrested a man, a resident of Bhatkal in Karnataka , from the airport after he was found to be concealing gold in his rectum in May last year. “We had also caught a man who was trying to exit the Pune airport with gold hidden in his wig in May last year. He was trying to smuggle in 957.10 gram of gold worth Rs 31.13 lakh,” another customs official said.

In October 2018, the customs authorities had caught four African women, following which more than 2kg of gold worth Rs 66.50 lakh was recovered from them. These women, who hailed from Sudan, had also concealed the gold in their rectum.

“In the recent past, the smugglers have used the carriers and have devised different ways to hide gold. There is no definite trend when it comes to concealment and the tricks,” a source said.

Nagpur: Activists and office bearers of Retired Territorial Army Personnel Association (RTAPA) staged a demonstration at Samvidhan Square on Monday, expressing apprehension that a club house is being planned inside the historical Sitabuldi Fort. They have demanded that the 118 Territorial Army (TA) should be brought back to the fort.

HQ Uttar Maharashtra and Gujarat Sub Area (UMANG), which took over possession of Sitabuldi Fort recently, has refuted the allegations and said they plan only to make available the mess, which already exists inside the fort, for ex-servicemen also.

Under the banner of Shivkalin Sitabuldi Qilla Bachao Samiti, activists led by chairman of Kisan Sewa Sangh Avinash Kakade and office bearers of RTAPA led by president Sukhdev Gadpayle and secretary Ramesh Kantekar staged a daylong demonstration. Activists Pramod Pande, Janardhan Moon, Mohnish Jabalpure, Dr Nayeem Khan etc also visited the agitation.

Following the directives of the defence ministry, the 80-year-old 118 TA had moved out of Sitabuldi Fort to Bhusawal last year. Now, UMANG, which was shifted from Mumbai to the city a year ago, has taken over possession of Sitabuldi Fort.

Kakade told TOI, “I have learnt that a club house with gym, auditorium etc has been planned inside Sitabuldi Fort. Messages are making the rounds among ex-TA personnel and ex-servicemen about the charges and facilities to be provided in Sitabuldi Fort. There seems to be some conspiracy behind moving out the 118 TA from city to Bhusawal. One of the ministers is also planning to make use of the Fort for various purposes. We will not allow the historical Sitabuldi Fort to lose it’s value.”

A message shown by Kakade to TOI mentions one-time subscription charges of Rs25,000, of which Rs5,000 will be security deposit. Monthly subscription will be Rs500. The message mentions the various types of facilities including bar and catering services.

Kakade added, “There is also a temple and dargah inside the fort. Everyone knows the significance of the fort for its long history and also visit of Mahatma Gandhi. The fort is also known for some martyrs. We will not tolerate a bar and other types of services inside it.”

Gadpayle too told TOI about his fears about a club house being planned inside the fort. “Shifting of 118 TA itself is a major setback for Vidarbha. 118 TA should be brought back at any cost. Vidarbha has lost a large number of jobs and a defence unit.”

Kakade said, “UMANG is a team with only 35 staffers and it has been given a fort spread over 100 acres. UMANG has been given an office and premises near RBI. There was no reason to hand over Sitabuldi Fort to UMANG. The city is blessed with offices and establishments of various defence sectors. Offices of all these like Air Force, Army, Ordnance Factory should be shifted to Sitabuldi Fort.”

Col Nikhil Deshpande of UMANG said, “All allegations levelled by activists are incorrect. We are not planning anything new inside the fort. There is a mess inside the fort. It is a common practice across the country that mess is made available also for ex-servicemen. Therefore, we are planning to permit mess for ex-servicemen. There is a gym at the mess which can also be used by ex-servicemen.”

103,['18/02/2020'],Rs10.61 cr to be paid as bonus to tendu collectors in region,"This story is from February 18, 2020

Nagpur: Over 1.83 families in 7 forest circles of Vidarbha who were involved in collection of tendu leaves last season will get Rs10.61 crore as bonus .

Forest minister Sanjay Rathod approved the proposal submitted by APCCF (non-timber forest produce) in November. The minister has asked officials concerned to distribute the bonus to all beneficiaries at the hands of district guardian ministers before March-end.

The policy of distributing bonus to tendu leaf collectors was started in the year 2006 when it was decided to distribute the excess amount after deducting the administrative cost plus 12% as bonus. Since then it is continuing.

Tendu bonus is the most important earning source for poor tribals living in forest areas. For nearly two months they stay near forests to collect tendu patta. Entire families are involved in tendu collection to earn maximum wages as well as bonus amount.

“As per government approval on February 12, 2020, we have issued orders to make payment of bonus amount to the family head of tendu leave collectors by transferring amount to their account or through cheques to all eligible stakeholders,” said APCCF (NTFP) TK Choubey.

This amount is in addition to the collection wages which they get for actual tendu leaves collection from respective contractors. Till 2006, the entire amount earned from the sale of tendu leaves was pocketed by the state government.

However, as per the policy decision in 2006-2007, the government decided to pay bonus to the stakeholders from royalty amount after deducting administrative expenses.

In 2019, the state forest department received royalty worth Rs38.77 crore towards sale of 204 units from which 2.24 lakh standard bags of tendu leaves were collected.

Of the total royalty amount, Rs28.15 crore were deducted towards administrative expenses and remaining amount will be distributed to tendu collectors. The circles that will benefit include Nagpur, Chandrapur, Gadchiroli, Dhule, Yavatmal, Amravati and Aurangabad.

Ram Gopal Varma

HYDERABAD: Filmmaker Ram Gopal Varma , who is planning to make a film on the Disha rape and murder, on Monday approached the police for information on the case.

Though Varma was received at ACP Ashok Kumar Goud’s office, the filmmaker was not able to meet the ACP. “I was away and not at my office when he came. I was busy otherwise because of local elections,” ACP Goud said. Asked by TOI if the information sought by the filmmaker will be given to him, the ACP said: “That is beyond our purview.”

Varma had announced his intention of making a film on Disha, and has already met the wife of one of the accused Chennakeshavulu.

He said as part of the research he was doing on the case, he would like to meet police officers involved in handling the case.

“I came here today only to meet the ACP, but who I will meet next is something I will reveal only later,” he told reporters at the Shamshabad ACP’s office.

“I need not take anyone’s permission to make the film as it was a big issue, and I will bring the story to the screen considering that I am a filmmaker,” he said.

According to the family members of Chennakeshavulu, one of the accused who was also killed in the police encounter, Varma had suggested to them that when the pregnant wife of Chennakeshavlu delivers a baby, they should name the baby Disha.

“It is not agreeable to us,” a family member said, though Chennakeshavulu’s wife was said to have initially given a positive answer to the suggestion.

In a recent tweet, Varma had said: “My next film is titled “Disha’ which is going to be about the Disha rape. After the brutal rape and horrific murder of Nirbhaya, the Disha rapists went further in their ghastliness in actually burning the poor girl with petrol.” A 26-year-old veterinary doctor, whom the police named Disha, was gangraped and murder by four men in Shamshabad on November 27, 2019. Subsequently, the accused were arrested and killed in a police encounter on December 6, 2019.

105,['18/02/2020'],Chennai corporation planning 15 flyovers at busy junctions,"Velachery intersection

CHENNAI: After a gap of two decades, Greater Chennai Corporation is laying the foundation to build flyovers at congested junctions.The corporation has submitted a proposal to the state government to build 15 grade separators at a cost of approximately `1,500 crore. The last time flyovers were built by the corporation was during the mayorship of M K Stalin, now DMK president.Corporation officials are observing the proceedings of the ongoing state assembly and hoping the government will give a green signal to the proposal.Government sources said it is likely that funds for grade separators, which do not involve land acquisition, may be initially sanctioned while the others will be taken up over the next few years.Senior corporation officials said Chennai has a lower ratio of flyover/grade separator to regular city roads in comparison to Mumbai, Kolkata and Delhi. This despite having the third highest two-wheeler population.Officials said the 15 locations were priority intersection points and were decided after a detailed study by a consultant. These are in Kilpauk, Basin Bridge, Velachery, RA Puram, Teynampet and Ayanavaram.The flyovers are expected to be short and the projects could be executed quickly at lesser cost. Integration with metro rail corridors has also been proposed. It is likely that like the Vadapalani flyover there may be multiple stacks of roads one above the other, to minimise land acquisition costs, an official said.According to the proposal, focus will be given on laying a 1.8m wide footpath beside the flyovers with well-designed approaches on the on-grade roads for better accessibility and safety.A senior official said congestion at signals leads to high emission of carbon dioxide and other polluting gases. “People living around the signal are affected by the pollution over a period of time. A flyover will ensure smoother traffic flow and bring down pollution levels,” theofficial said. This is similar to big cities in developed countries which offer reliable public transport as well as riding comfort for motorists with flyovers, he said.However, a transportation engineer working with the government said policy makers should work towards improving public transport instead of constructing flyovers to aid motorists.“In transportation engineering, it is believed that flyovers are a temporary solution as they transfer vehicles from one junction to another. The long-term solution should be to reduce vehicle registration and push citizens towards mass rapid transit systems like metro rail, suburban trains by subsidising such modes and construction of bus rapid transit systems,” the engineer said.",chennai,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74185616,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-783517,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/corporation-planning-15-flyovers-at-busy-junctions/articleshow/74182030.cms

The contraband has been sent to a lab for tests

CHENNAI: Customs officials posted at Chennai international airport on Sunday seized 6.8kg methaqualone worth Rs 3.4 crore from a warehouse in the city.

This is the second case in less than a week where the drug has been seized by central investigative agencies. On February 10, DRI officials made a seizure of 12.98kg of the contraband worth Rs 6.5 crore. In both cases, the drug was on its way to Australia.

On Sunday, customs officials received information that a parcel containing narcotics was likely to be smuggled out of the country through courier in the guise of apparel accessories. The courier intelligence unit of air customs detained one parcel at a courier warehouse in the city.

The consignor had declared the parcel to contain ribbon rolls and other apparel accessories. When examined, the parcel was found to contain items as per declaration but the ribbon rolls were unusually heavy. When the rolls were cut open, a hollow cavity was found inside each in which plastic pouches containing white crystalline powder was concealed. Fifty-seven such pouches were recovered from the rolls.

The powder was tested with narcotics testing kit and prima facie tested positive for methaqualone. A total of 6.815kg of white crystalline powder suspected to be methaqualone and valued at Rs. 3.4 crore was seized under the NDPS Act, 1985. The sample has been sent to laboratory for a confirmatory test.

The parcel was booked by a city-based person and was consigned to Australia. Searches were carried out at the address submitted by the consignor, but the address was fake. Efforts are being made to apprehend the consignor and to find the source of the seized drug, customs said.

Methaqualone is a central nervous depressant that acts as a sedative and hypnotic. The drug takes 30 minutes to kick in and its effects can last up to 8 hours. The drug was made famous in 70s by famous rock band Rolling Stones and also in the famous Hollywood movie ‘The Wolf of Wall Street’, customs said.

Aurangabad: The Aurangabad division of Maharashtra State Board of Secondary and Higher Secondary Education (MSBSHE) has warned colleges of stern action if they refuse to cooperate in conducting the HSC examination as per the schedule.

A section of colleges from the division had said it would boycott the HSC examination to press for their pending demands. In a statement issued a day before the start of HSC examination on Monday, the MSBSHE secretary Sugatha Punne has warned that colleges refusing to cooperate during the examination would lose their affiliation.

“A section of colleges had said they would not receive answer-sheets in order to protest the delay in accepting their demands. We would like to bring to the attention of such colleges that any act of non-cooperation that would affect the smooth conduct of the examination will draw stern action. The errant colleges would face de-recognition,” MSBSHE authorities said.

Converting permanently unaided institutions to aided ones and reintroducing old pension scheme are some of the major demands being raised by teaching and non-teaching staff from the unaided colleges.

Agitating teachers said that nearly 9,000 teachers have been affected due to an alleged arbitrary decision by the state education department to make Teacher Eligibility Test (TET) mandatory from retrospective effect.

“It is the state government which is expected to take policy decisions on different demands raised by college staffers. The role of MSBSHE is restricted to only conducting examinations and declaring results. We appeal to staffers not to hold students at ransom,” MSBSHE authorities said.

Nashik: The families of four farmers who had committed suicide have been found eligible for government aid, while the relatives of nine others were not as they had failed to meet the set criteria.

The district committee on farmers’ suicide reviewed a total of 16 suicide cases, out which a decision on four has been kept pending for further study.

District administration officials, however, said that the kin of the nine farmers can approach the government under the Gopinath Munde farmers’ insurance scheme, under which, the death of a farmer for any reason is compensated with Rs 2 lakh.

“The committee has unanimously rejected nine cases as they failed to meet the criteria laid down by the government of Maharashtra.

There are conditions such as financial burden and stress being the only reason for cause of suicide, repeated follow-up by financial institutions over dues and frequent crop failure etc,” said an official.

The family members of the four farmers — Suresh Nivrutti Vidhate (Pimpalgaon), Hemant Bhimrao Malode (Niphad taluka), Nawal Jairam Pawar (Ajmer Saindane, Baglan) and Tensign Mansing Magar will be entitled to get government aid. The government gives Rs 30,000 in cash and Rs 1 lakh is kept in the bank account as fixed deposit.

“The help given to the farmers by the government is too small. In fact Rs 30,000 is spent on the rituals by the family. While FD helps with some small steady income, the loan of the farmers remains to be paid,” Rajesh Shertate, a farmer, said.

111,['18/02/2020'],Home secy to probe CAG findings on police,"This story is from February 18, 2020

Thiruvananthapuram: With the recent CAG report making scathing remarks against the police, chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan sought a detailed report from additional chief secretary (home and vigilance) Vishwas Mehta regarding the comments and findings of the report.

It is reliably learnt that Vijayan has asked Mehta to conduct an inquiry into all matters cited in CAG report and furnish a new report. Sources said state police chief Loknath Behera has sent an explanation to the home secretary, based on which Mehta will prepare his report.

However, a clause-by-clause explanation of the findings of CAG’s report will be given only before the public accounts committee of the assembly that will consider the report in detail as part of the legislative procedure.

CAG report had criticized the police on several matters. They are unauthorized purchase of bulletproof vehicles for VVIP security, shortage of weapons and live cartridges at state armed police battalion in the capital, procedural lapses in the procurement of vehicle-mounted GPS-based communication system, lapses in the procurement of voice-logger system, procedural lapses in the procurement of security equipment for Sabarimala and irregularity in the construction of villas for DGP and ADGPs using the funds for quarters for subordinate officers.

Though the police had offered its justification for the findings of the audit team, the latter hadn’t agreed with the arguments of the police; resulting in the final report carrying highly critical remarks in these matters.

The police top brass is of the view that though the performance audit had incisively pointed out some of the procedural errors on the part of the department and suggested adopting the best possible actions in the matters of financial dealings, it was critical of the police wherever a minor lacuna was revealed. The general sentiments within the force is that the audit had omitted some crucial aspects of police performance such as modernization and law and order while conducting the actual evaluation of the performance of the police department.

The police leadership is learnt to have explained to the government that deviations from the modernization of police force scheme guidelines, if any, was based on the contingencies and realistic evaluation of department requirements. The scheme guidelines are always taken as the prime reference, though at times absolute adherence to the same may not have occurred, the police explained to the government.

NEW DELHI: In his third term as chief minister of Delhi, Arvind Kejriwal will not keep any department with himself. Allotting portfolios to his council of ministers on Monday, Kejriwal gave the charge of water — which he had directly handled for over two years in the previous term — to health minister Satyendar Jain .Most ministers will continue to hold the charge of the departments they headed in the previous term with one or two cosmetic changes made to balance the work. The changes include giving charge of the department of environment, forest and wildlife to Gopal Rai and women and child development to Rajendra Pal Gautam.According to a government statement, Kejriwal will now directly oversee the work of all ministers. “He will monitor all operational processes and functioning of all departments. He will also ensure interactions with the public to resolve the grievances and induce communication between his government and the public,” the statement read.Kejriwal headed the water department as chairperson of Delhi Jal Board in the first term of AAP government, which lasted just 49 days. After re-election in February 2015, he did not keep any department with himself. However, half-way into the term, Kejriwal took over DJB in September 2017, making it the first and only portfolio for him since AAP formed its second government.With laying down of water pipelines in all unauthorised colonies and supply of 24-hour clean water to every household being government’s top priority, Kejriwal has shown faith in Jain, who launched the flagship mohalla clinic scheme, started free medicines and pathological and diagnostic tests, and expedited the construction of classrooms in government schools in last five years.Environment is also among the key departments that AAP government will focus on. In its 10-point guarantee card, Kejriwal government has set the target of reducing air pollution by a third, cleaning up Yamuna and planting of over 2 crore saplings to make Delhi a “green city”.Rai, in the previous term, held relatively light portfolios, such as labour, development and employment. Sources confirmed that Kejriwal had handed over a huge responsibility to Rai by giving him the charge of environment, forest and wildlife departments.The charge of environment department was initially given to Imran Hussain, but later handed over to Kailash Gahlot in July last year. With Delhi’s air pollution level hovering around the “severe” level, especially in winter, it will be a challenge for Rai to take effective steps to fulfil the promise made in the guarantee card.Another change made by the chief minister is giving the charge of women and child development to Gautam. The portfolio was held by deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia between 2015 and 2020. “The portfolio of WCD is generally held by the same minister who looks after the social welfare department. Since Manish ji is already overburdened, the CM probably felt it appropriate to give the charge of WCD to Gautam ji,” a source said.Sisodia will look after education, finance, planning, land and building, vigilance, services, tourism, art, culture and language and all other departments not specifically allocated to any minister. Rai will now look after the departments of employment, development, labour and general administration department, environment, forest and wildlife, while Jain will hold the portfolio of the key departments of health, industries, Public Works Department, power, home, urban development and irrigation and flood control.Imran Hussain will handle food and supply and election departments of Kejriwal-led Delhi government.",delhi,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74185675,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-732997,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/cm-wont-hold-any-portfolio-jain-gets-water/articleshow/74182782.cms

Students during a sports session at GHMC grounds in Ameerpet

HYDERABAD: In what could benefit city schools immensely, GHMC has decided to slash user fee charges of playgrounds , sports complexes and indoor stadia owned by it. For instance, the fee has been cut down to Rs 40,000 for a playground spread over a 1,000 square metres from Rs 60,000 previously. The playground can be used for six days (150 hours).

Not just schools, even individuals and corporations can take advantage of GHMC’s largess as rates of weekend slots have also been reduced. In the new tariff regime, a playground for half a day can be booked by shelling out Rs 4,000. Earlier, Rs 6,000 fee used to be charged. Also, if one wants the ground for the entire day, GHMC will take Rs 7,500 towards user fee charges, which used to be Rs 11,000.

While GHMC believes this would promote sporting activity across the city, senior officials said specific time slots have been allotted solely for schools to use the playgrounds. “A majority of the schools utilise these grounds during the academic calender — between June and March,” a senior official explained.

The GHMC standing committee had already approved the proposal. “It will be passed by the council soon,” the official said.

Officials said schools which lack playgrounds stand to gain from GHMC’s offer. Normally, these schools book the nearest GHMC playgrounds so that the students can play and promote sporting activities.

In addition to the booking fee for grounds, the monthly membership fee for specific sports has also been reduced. For instance, swimming was charged at Rs 1,500 per month. The new tariff has been revised to Rs 1,000. Similarly, for shuttle badminton, the fee has been cut to Rs 500 per month from Rs 750.

Nashik: The Manmad-Mumbai-Manmad Panchavati Express has got one modified LHB coach providing much needed relief to the daily commuters.

The modified LHB coach, constructed by Modern Coach Factory in Raebareli, has all the facilities that the passengers have been demanding.

“The Linke Hoffman Busch (LHB) coaches are the safest, but those manufactured at the Integrated Coach Factory (ICF) were uncomfortable. The new coach is the best and we want the Central Railway to install more such coaches,” Kiran Borse, a regular commuter, said.

The problem with old LHB coaches — introduced in the year 2018 — was that they were uncomfortable for sitting. “Every day we had to travel in the same manner and that was taking a toll on our backs. The leg space between two seats was also less making it difficult for us to sit,” Keshav Marathe, another traveler, said.

The windows were also were placed in unplanned manner that affected the aeration in the coach. “The new LHB coach installed in the train (D5) is comfortable and has more windows aligned to the seats, better aeration and most importantly there are facing seats with better ergonomic and more leg room,” Vaishali Kulkarni, another regular traveler, said.

There are no bucket seats and since they are facing each other there is remarkable rise in leg space adding to the comforts. A railway official from Manmad said they had received the coach from Mumbai as replacement and that has also given us an opportunity to check its feasibility with the passengers on this route.

“Panchavati Express is likely to get a new rake in the next five months. But at this point in time we have got this coach and looking at the feedback we are likely retain the same here,” the officer said.

Another senior official from Bhusawal said the engineering department had carried out certain changes in the LHB coaches of Panchavati Express that were appreciated by the passengers.

The next generation that has joined the company is working in a well-defined manner,” said Nilesh Kotak, a city-based stock analyst.Torrent Pharma has benefited from its continued focus on India, Brazil and Germany markets and synergies with the acquired business of Unichem. “The company’s solid India franchise, robust earnings growth and superior return profile justifies its premium over the industry peers,” said Devarsh Vakil, head advisory, PCG, HDFC Securities.According to him, Torrent Pharma’s business in India is expected to post a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 11% over the next three years. The Brazil business is seen growing at 10% CAGR during the same period.“Torrent Power is focused more on distribution of electricity rather than on its generation. Its margins are increasing as the company is currently getting power at a lower cost. The recently announced general budget’s focus on power distribution augurs well for the company,” said Kotak.The stock analysts opine that Torrent Power’s distribution business is doing well on all operational parameters and the outlook for the company’s gas-based power generation capacity is positive.

Pune: A candidate vaccine is ready for pre-clinical trials, and possibly even human trials within six months, as part of the collaboration by Pune-based Serum Institute of India (SII) and American biotechnology firm Codagenix to develop a preventive vaccine against the novel coronavirus (COVID-19).

While efforts to find a coronavirus vaccine have already started globally, the SII-Codagenix candidate vaccine, developed using a laboratory-made synthetic virus, is an important breakthrough because it could significantly reduce the time taken to build a shield against the virus at the heart of the current outbreak emanating from China.

“Conventional approaches usually take seven to eight years to fully develop a vaccine for use. We have already marched ahead by generating a candidate vaccine in the laboratory of our US-based partner Codagenix. Our vaccine-virus strain is identical to the original virus and can generate a robust immune response,” industrialist Adar Poonawalla, owner and CEO of SII, told TOI in an exclusive interview on Monday.

“We will be ready for human trials within six months, which makes it the fastest ‘Made in India’ vaccine to enter this phase. Thereafter, it all depends on the regulatory clearance from the Union health ministry. Human studies will take another year. We hope to be ready with the vaccine by early 2022. This shows India’s capability to respond to a global pandemic in real time,” Poonawalla said.

When contacted, senior scientist R R Gangakhedkar, chief of epidemiology at the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), told TOI, “The approach is exciting in principle. It will be wonderful if it works. But it will have to go through elaborate laboratory and animal studies before being tested in human clinical trials. Using this method, they (SII) may also go closer to produce a generic influenza vaccine as against the current cocktail of three strains.”

The SII-Codagenix project will cost Rs 250-300 crore and vaccine major SII plans to secure external funding through its multiple international partners. “In a month’s time, we will enter into animal studies. By August-end, we will have data on mice and primates to submit to regulatory authorities to enter into the human trials phase,” Poonawalla said. “We are in talks with a number of firms across the globe for potential partnerships. We are also not excluding China as a potential site for our clinical trials.”

Poonawalla, who is also president of the Indian Vaccine Manufacturers’ Association, “Our live-attenuated vaccine against the novel coronavirus is just another demonstration of Indian vaccine industries’ capabilities of developing new and innovative vaccines required globally. Vaccines against typhoid, rotavirus and pneumococcal infections launched recently by Indian firms, including Bharat Biotech, Biological E and SII, have already made an impact worldwide.”

Wait on

Allahabad: It has been almost a month since the Union ministry of human resource development (MHRD) asked Allahabad University authorities to nominate two persons to the search committee for the new vice-chancellor but the varsity is yet to call the meeting of its executive council (EC).

The university’s EC will finalise two members to the committee who will be joined by the third member to be nominated by the President (in capacity of Visitor of AU ).

As per norms, AU has to select the new vice-chancellor within 90 days from publishing of the advertisement of the post, that is, April 19. AU had published advertisement for the post of VC on January 20 and a deadline of one month was given to aspirants to file their applications.

As per the practice, MHRD instructs the university concerned to nominate two members for the search committee. Later, another member, nominated by the Visitor (President of the country), is added to the search committee. This team scrutinizes the names of applicants who apply for the post.

After scrutiny and direct interaction with applicants, whose number is decided by the search committee, the names are forwarded to the Visitor who takes the final decision. According to sources, AU will hold a meeting of the Academic Council (AC) in the first week of March and that of Executive Council after Holi. It is a common practice that AC’s meeting is held on the campus and its minutes are tabled in EC meeting for approval.

The Academic Council meeting is also important as it will decide the fate of the students of Ewing Christian College (ECC) who will be provided degrees from AU in future. After the AC meeting, the executive council will decide the names of two members to be nominated to the search committee. AU spokesman Shailendra Mishra said, “AU has to nominate two names for the search committee and the EC meeting will be convened to take a decision on the issue.”

Rajkot: Owner of a country made liquor brewery and his aide were arrested on Sunday night for allegedly murdering a 32-year-old drunkard man over the issue of payment for liquor in Urban Health Sector in Junagadh on Saturday evening.

Police said the accused, identified as Sagar Rathod and Rahul Vala, had allegedly killed Vijay Ghughal with sticks.

During their interrogation, Rathod and Vala told the cops that Ghughal used to visit the brewery daily and would not pay for the liquor he consumed. On Saturday, when he refused to pay, they beat him up with sticks.

“When Ghughal fell unconscious due to the beating, the accused laid him on the verandah and threw a bucket full of water on him. However, when he did not come around, they called up Ghughal’s uncle Amu. Amu took Ghughal’s father Heera to the spot where the accused told them that Ghughal was rendered unconscious due to heavy drinking,” said Pradeepsinh Jadeja, Junagadh deputy superintendent of police.

When the postmortem revealed that Ghughal had succumbed to injuries that he had suffered from beating, the police rounded up Rathod and Vala, as they were the prime suspects. During their questioning, the duo confessed to their crime.

Chennai: Alleging involvement of higher officials of TNPSC (Tamil Nadu Public Service Commission) including its chairperson in the recent recruitment to group 2 and group 4 services, the DMK on Monday approached the Madras high court seeking a CBI investigation.

“Huge sharks who are involved in this scam are let go free, while lower-level TNPSC officials are arrested and remanded. Without the involvement of TNPSC’s controller of exams, secretary and chairperson including the printers (who print the answer and question sheets) who are located outside the state, such a huge scam would have not happened,” said P Wilson, senior counsel representing the DMK.

Wilson made the submissions on a plea moved by Swapna, a transsexual candidate alleging irregularities in the recruitment to group 1 service in 2015. When the plea came up for hearing before a division bench of Justice R Subbaiah and Justice R Pongiappan, the senior counsel submitted that such scams have shocked the conscience of public and that the present plea has become a public interest litigation. He wanted the court to permit, DMK’s organising secretary R S Bharathi to implead in the case. Permitting to implead, the bench adjourned the hearing to February 28.

Wilson submitted that three investigating officers probing the scam have been changed and authorities are attempting to change the fourth officer as well to file a favourable report. “One of remand reports filed by IO (investigating officer) shows a telephone conversation by Sam Rajeswaran, another kingpin of Apollo Institute, with exam paper setters and correctors of answer sheets. The telephone log connects Manithaneyam Trust. Till now, neither of them has been arrested” Wilson said.

Though not technically possible, participants at Otakus (Japanese anime/manga lovers) were seen in colourful attire, wigs and accessories resembling like their favourite anime character at the Comic Otaku Superhero Convention at Suresh Bhatt Hall in Reshimbagh on Monday.

Organized by members of Nagpur Anime Club (NAC), the event was first held in 2015 and the second time in 2017. “This time we wanted to make it bigger and better. We had participants coming all the way from Mumbai and Meghalaya to give the event their best shot,” said Samarth Thakral, organizer and founder of NAC.

Such conventions are regularly held in metros and hence, two youngsters, Samarth and Tanmay Atte jointly organized this convention in the city.

“The idea is to get out of reality, to be someone you are not and get to be your favourite superhero. Many are not fortunate enough to go to Japan, so why not bring Japan here,” believes Atte.

The event had national and international guests like Sonal Kaushal (voice of doraemon), Vaibhav Lal (founder of vkaao) and Megumu Ishiguro san (production supervisor for Ramayana anime.

The Cosplay duo competition was the highlight of the festival. It is a practice of dressing up as a character from a film, book or video game, especially one from the Japanese genres of manga or anime.

Apart from the competition, there were other amazing events like the quiz competition based on the Netflix series and Japanese karaoke.

This coscon drew inspiration from the Japanese festival of Natsumatsuri. Big Japanese cultural organizations like Japan Foundation, JNTO and consulate general of Japan (Mumbai) were the event supporters.

The winner of Pop Culture Hiroshima (India qualifiers) held at COSCON Nagpur was Team Abyssal Scar (Donald Khumlo and Garry Nelson Syiem). Their cosplay performance as Gilgamesh and Berserker (Fate Zero) was truly amazing, drawing applause from both the audience as well as the judges. It was an exciting daylong event filled with excitement and enthusiasm.

Hyderabad: At a time when students of private junior colleges are made to write series of tests as part of their board examination preparation, those studying in government colleges hardly got any practice as they appeared for only two pre-final examinations.

While one of the pre-finals was conducted in the month of January, the other exam is scheduled to be held after practical examinations.

“The syllabus was completed only in December. So, there was hardly any time to conduct more practice examinations,” said KS Rama Rao, Telangana Government Junior Colleges Principals association. He said that major part of February was dedicated for practical examination.

“After February 20, we are planning to conduct second and pre-final examinations,” he added.

Parents said that it would have been better if students get more practice before appearing for the board examination.

“Ideally, they should have conducted chapter wise tests for intermediate students also. Apart from giving them required practice, students would have also known important questions from each chapter,” said M Veerabhadra Rao, whose daughter is studying in intermediate first year.

While corporate colleges are conducting weekly tests to ensure that students are exam ready, private colleges too are conducting unit wise tests apart from pre-finals.

“Unit wise tests are conducted by almost every private college managements in the state. On average, students are made to write at least three pre-final examinations. To ensure students get enough time for rectifying errors they made in an exam, a gap of at least 15 days is given in between exams,” said G Satish, honorary president, Telangana Private Intermediate Colleges Association.

The Telangana State Board of Intermediate Officials (TSBIE), meanwhile, said that although they indeed lost few working days because of RTC strike, it has no impact on preparation exams. They said that every year they officially conduct only two pre-final exams and it is up to respective college principals and lecturers to conduct more examinations, if required. They said that apart from pre-finals, they also conducted four unit tests, quarterly, and half-yearly examinations.

Later, the injured people’s families complained that the two had been beaten up by a mob. The accident occurred while they were trying to escape the mob. However, the police ignored their complaint and instead registered an FIR against the two injured for cow smuggling under Rajasthan Bovine Act.

“Prima facie it does not look like a case of mob lynching. We have not found any receipt from them for purchase of the bovines. A case has been registered against them under Rajasthan Bovine Act for cow smuggling. They met with an accident in the morning while transporting cows. We have admitted them to the hospital,” Deepak Kumar, assistant commissioner of police, Alwar (south) told TOI.

However, the relatives of the two injured showed receipt to the police issued by the Jaipur Municipal Corporation on Monday at 1.37am. On the receipt, it is written that the estimated cost of three cows and two calves is Rs 90,000. The JMC also collected Rs 600 as tax from the duo. The receipt was issued in the name of one Altaf, resident of Pahari of Bharatpur, who was one of the injured in the mini-truck.

“Wahid, a resident of Nuh (Haryana) and Altaf, resident of Pahari (Bharatpur) were in the vehicle. They were beaten up by cow vigilantes,” claimed Shokat, a relative of the injured. He also showed the receipt issued by JMC claiming that they were not cow smugglers and had bought the cows from a cattle market in Hatwara, Jaipur.

Despite Ashok Gehlot-led state government enacting a law to prevent mob lynching, such incidents are reported quite frequently.

134,['18/02/2020'],Thyagaraja tribute back on stage after 28 years,"‘Thyaagaraaja Vaibhavam’, the two-hour drama focuses on bhakti as the highest form of ‘shringara’.

CHENNAI: It was while listening to the rendering of ‘nannu vidachi’ by M D Ramanathan that veteran Bharatanatyam dancer V P Dhananjayan decided to produce a dance drama on the Carnatic composer Thyagaraja (1767 to 1847) in 1992.‘Thyaagaraaja Vaibhavam’, the two-hour drama focuses on bhakti as the highest form of ‘shringara’. It was challenging because Thyagaraja kritis were never considered favourites in Bharatanatyam, as their concentration on bhakti and lack of ‘shringara bhava’ (romantic love) discouraged dancers from exploring their potential as dance music.The two-hour drama was broadcast on television but gradually lost its theatrical value. Dhananjayan has now revived the drama to portray the essence of Thyagaraja’s musical achievement through some of his great compositions.""It was a great experience when we first did the play in 1992. A journey through Thyagaraja’s compositions was challenging. But the spirit has doubled as years passed. We used simple attires to get a natural feel for the character in the drama,"" said Dhananjayan, who donned the role of Thyagaraja in the play, which was staged at Kalakshetra Foundation recently.Thyagaraja was born in Tiruvarur, an ancient town on the banks of the Cauvery. He composed and sang hundreds of songs in praise of Rama, his beloved deity during a span of 80 years.""Thyagaraja, along with his contemporaries Shyama Shastri and Muthuswami Dikshitar, have enriched Carnatic music. The music of this great saint composer is dedicated to the attainment of peace and happiness through sacrifice and renunciation. It is bhakti yoga at its highest,"" said Dhananjayan, who choreographed the dance drama based on on the lyrics of Thyagaraja and Mysore Vasudevacharya.The 81-year-old dancer immersed himself into a musical sojourn before taking up the project again.""I explored the life of Thyagaraja through some of his main compositions. I listened to many of them in 1992 and when I thought of reviving the drama, I went through the songs again. I think I learn something new each time I listen to him,"" he said.‘Thyaagaraaja Vaibhavam’, according to Dhananjayan, attempts to portray the musical achievement of Thyagaraja through his own compositions. ""When Thyagaraja’s brother threw away the Rama idols into the Cauvery, the result was more music expressing the bhakt’s anguish. When he miraculously recovered the idols, there was more music this time of a rapturous mood,"" he said.The use of shadow play in the background to interpret the song being portrayed on stage makes the drama different. ""We revived the play because we thought it is a great tribute to Thyagaraja. The play will also create awareness among youngsters about the great composer,"" said Dhananjayan.",chennai,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74184873,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-359417,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/thyagaraja-tribute-back-on-stage-after-28-years/articleshow/74182095.cms

TOITOI

Pune: Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP) state unit chief Chandrakant Patil on Monday said the party could have formed the government in Maharashtra had its alliance partner not ditched them.

He was speaking at a programme to felicitate the mayor Murlidhar Mohol in Kothrud. Mohol was felicitated by a group of citizens in Kothrud for becoming the first mayor from the area.

Leaders from different political parties were present at the event.

“From now on, the elections will not be won through event management. Those who can win the trust of the public will sail through,” Patil said, adding that former chief minister Devendra Fadnavis was able to build such trust.

“Fadnavis would have broken the record of former chief minister Vasantrao Naik (for being the longest serving CM), had there been no back-stabbing,” Patil said. Naik was the longest serving CM of Maharashtra, who had a tenure of 11 years.

Patil, who is the Kothrud MLA, said redevelopment of slums int the city was a major concern. He said the slum rehabilitation authority schemes were not proving to be successful.

Leader of the opposition in the state assembly Devendra Fadnavis said resolving traffic issues would be a challenge in Pune. “The traffic and sewage issues are causing pollution. Vehicular population and the large number of two-wheelers in the city are a big worry. Green transport should be promoted. The aim should be to develop a pollution-free Pune,” he said.

Representative image

LUCKNOW: A 15-year-old boy who was in custody since December 25 for anti-CAA protests in Lucknow and sent to the juvenile home has been granted special leave to appear in UP Secondary Education Board’s Class 10 examinations which begin on Tuesday.

The minor boy, a resident of Sheesh Mahal in the Old City, was granted special leave by the Juvenile Justice Board (JJB) where his case is pending.

He walked out of the juvenile home on Monday evening after spending 55 days in custody. The order, passed on February 14, stated that special leave was from February 17 evening till February 23. So, he will have to return to the juvenile home situated on Mohaan Road on February 24.

As per his documents, including birth certificate, school marksheet and Aadhaar card, the boy’s date of birth is May 19, 2004.

It was an emotional moment as he walked out on Monday evening and re-united with his father, who was waiting at the gates of the juvenile home along with his lawyer.

“I received my books inside the home but could not prepare much for the exams since we have to follow a tight schedule in the shelter home. After cleaning tables to washing dishes to other such chores, hardly any time was left for studies,” the boy told TOI.

“I have my Hindi examination on Tuesday and will stay up the night to prepare for it,” he added.

His lawyer Mohd Tanveer said the boy’s name was not mentioned in the initial FIR lodged by the police on December 20. “He was picked up by the police on December 25 and shown under ‘identified persons’ in the FIR. He was produced before a magistrate on December 26 and sent to the juvenile home,” Tanveer claimed.

“We filed an application before the JJB seeking permission that the boy be allowed to write his board examinations and our plea was acknowledged by the board,” he added.

As per Section 98 (1) of The Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015, the board can permit leave on special occasions like examination, marriage of relatives, death of kith or kin or accident or serious illness of parent or any emergency of like nature, for seven days.

139,['18/02/2020'],"Delhi: Public bus fleet crosses 6,000 for first time in 10 years","This story is from February 18, 2020

Last December, 100 standard-floor buses were officially launched under the Cluster scheme

NEW DELHI: In the past one and a half months when Delhi was in the grip of the election fever, its public transport system reached a milestone. After witnessing a constant dip for a decade, the number of public buses again breached the 6,000 mark during this period, even crossing the peak witnessed in 2010.

Last December, 100 standard-floor buses were officially launched under the Cluster scheme, taking the total number of buses in Delhi , including Delhi Transport Corporation (DTC) ones, to 5,989. This batch of non-AC standard-floor buses, with hydraulic lifts, took the number of Cluster scheme buses to 2,208.

After the model code of conduct for the assembly elections came into force on January 6, no announcement could be made. But 204 standard-floor buses were inducted in the Cluster scheme fleet in January-February, taking the total number of public buses in Delhi to 6,223 against the 2010 peak of 6,204.

Another 30 airconditioned, blue-coloured buses have arrived in the city for the Cluster scheme. “The airconditioned buses, a first for the scheme, are in the final stage of certification,” an official said. The capital has 1,275 AC buses at present, all of which are in the DTC fleet.

During the 2010 Commonwealth Games, Delhi government inducted air condition and non-AC low-floor buses into DTC. This was the time when private Blueline buses were on their way out following a string of fatal accidents. The Cluster scheme was yet to be launched.

While the DTC fleet has since been dipping every year, the Cluster scheme, starting with 231 buses in November 2011, has gained in strength. However, its total strength is still only 56.5% of the required 11,000 buses. Delhi government is trying to get 4,000 more buses at the earliest.

The standard-floor buses under the Cluster scheme are part of the 650 buses for which a contract was earlier awarded and the bidding is on for 350 more. DTC is also in the process of procuring 1,000 low-floor CNG Buses, for which work order is expected to be awarded soon.

Electric buses are likely to roll out in the city this year for the first time, but the process may take a little longer than expected. These include 1,000 electric buses under the Cluster model. DTC is also in the process of procuring 1,000 electric buses. Tender for 300 buses each for both DTC and the Cluster scheme were floated earlier but will have to be issued afresh.

The ashram accepts online donations from its members only

Allahabad: At a time when the government is making all efforts to promote cashless transactions, saints at a camp in the ongoing Magh Mela are receiving dakshina (donations) via online transactions through BHIM app.

The camp of Aum Waheguru Rishi ashram , having its headquarters at Delhi, has been operating its Annakshetra at Sangam Lower Marg wherein around 40,000 devotees are served food thrice a day.

Members of the ashram offer ‘dakshina’ either directly to the account of the ashram through BHIM app or in cash. The ashram has been encouraging its members to make online donations during prominent religious events like Magh Mela, Khumbh or Maha Kumbh.

According to office-bearers, the ashram does not receive donations from devotees visiting their camp and only members of the ashram can donate.

Swami Satyanand Saraswati Satyam, who manages the Annakshetra of the ashram, said: “We have been coming to Teerthraj Prayag for last 35-40 years to attend Kumbh, Ardh Kumbh & Magh Mela. We have also been attending Kumbh Melas in Ujjain, Trimbakeshwar Nashik & Haridwar along with Surya Grahan Mela at Kurukshetra. Donations are an integral part of the camp. We introduced cashless donations after demonetisation in 2017.”

“Seers are encouraged to use mobile app and their number is increasing every year — starting from a modest 18 in 2018 to over 300 this year,” he said.

Besides, the entire activities of Annakshetra, wherein around 100-110 quintal of foodgrains (flour, pulses, rice, etc) and 200 litres of milk per day is consumed, are sponsored by the members of the ashram alone.

“We donate 11% of our income with an undertaking mostly in cheques, which upon acceptance are pooled as a common fund as no CSR fund, government aid or any individual donation is used at all,” said Swami Satyam, a practising lawyer in Supreme Court.

“We believe that whatever is served to the deity should be pure and not used by others. The same applies to currency notes which is offered to god and later distributed among the saints, who are around 25% of the total attendance of the Annakshetra on any given day. Therefore, we accept only new currency notes if the donation is not online,” he added.

The kitchen area of the Annakshetra is partly mechanized and food is served in steel utensils in the camp which is washed by women members of the ashram.

Another aspect which makes this camp special is the fact that besides offering free food thrice a day, the common public is offered various items as dakshina.

“Distribution of clothes, blankets, steel utensils, umbrellas, shawls, oil, roasted healthy food & digestive tablets, Chyavanprash, torches, carpets, yoga mats, caps, socks, jackets and other items of utility are given in ‘dakshina’ on our part,” he said.

PUNE: Flyers will have to brave parking hassles at the Pune airport for two more years as the multilevel car parking facility will be completed only by 2022.

“The Rs 120-crore multilevel car parking facility is being constructed to accommodate 1,000 cars. It will come up in the parking number 1, which is opposite to the entry gate of the airport, and will be completed in the next two years. The parking problems will be resolved once it is ready. Due meagre land resources, we are not able to immediately shift the existing car parking to any other location,” the airport authorities said in a series of tweets.

Ravi Suresh Jain, the director of Pune-based Pebbles Infratech, which is developing the parking lot, had earlier said the parking number 1, which is spread over 90,000sqft, had not been fully given to them. “We are presently working on 35,000sqft where digging works are going on. We were told that we will get the whole area by mid-February but that has not happened. We have heard that talks are on with the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) in the matter,” he said.

Taking to Twitter, the airport authorities further said, “We are exploring several options to accommodate passengers and visitors’ vehicles during the construction period. None of these options have yet been finalized due to several reasons.”

In January, former airport director Ajay Kumar had said that the matter had been sorted out, adding that a plot owned by a private party adjacent to the parking number-1 would be used for parking till the new facility was ready.

However, in a recent conversation, Kuldeep Singh, the new airport director, said otherwise. “The landowner stopped responding to us,” he said.

When contacted, PMC commissioner Shekhar Gaikwad told TOI the matter had been brought to his notice by Airports Authority of India officials. “There are two private landowners, who do not seem to be interested in giving their land for the parking. Our chief engineer will have a word with them again in a bid to convince them,” he said.

The developments mean that the passengers will have to face parking inconvenience till the multilevel car parking facility is completed.

“The other day, it took me around 20 minutes just to get my two-wheeler out of the parking lot due to lack of space and haphazard parking. The authorities should address the situation at the earliest,” Paritosh Jain, who went to the airport to drop his brother recently, said.

Dr Manjushree Sardeshpande gives a lecture in a programme organized by Association of Counsellors and Psychoth... Read More

Nagpur: ‘Ek mai aur ek tu.. love, intimacy and beyond’, a special Valentine’s Day programme organized by the Association of Counsellors and Psychotherapists (ACPN), Nagpur, at Laburnum Hall, Chitnavis Centre, on Sunday evening highlighted the issues of social taboos and stigmas on relationships.

“Given the era of modernization, people often confuse attraction with love,” said keynote speaker, Dr Hemant Mittal, a consulting psychiatrist, while delivering his speech on the topic —‘Power and responsibility of love’.

“The power of love is a thought of making it last. If there’s direction and focus, love will have a long run. If two people do not find this thought uplifting enough, then it is clearly not love, but attraction,” said Mittal.

He clarified where love actually comes from and stated that it’s an emotion that gets generated emotionally due to external inputs. He also described the direction of love as an attraction formed in one’s mind, but with logic.

According to Mittal, most relationships fail because they do not advance in a stage-wise manner.

Guest speaker, Dr Manjushree Sardeshpande, HOD of the English department from RS Mundle College, began with a sonnet by William Shakespeare.

“True love is not easy to find,” she said, adding, “The purest form of love is a mother’s love.”

She spoke about the past, present and future of love relationships and how changes are taking place from generation to generation. “Love is selfless. The one who only thinks about others displays genuine and selfless love. The current generation is confused and highly mistaken about what real love is all about. Most youngsters do not think about their partners and this ruins their relationship.”

In the group discussion, coordinator Dr Chetan Rewatkar questioned the panellists — Mittal, Sardeshpande, Shruti Rathi, a student and Palash Makadwar, an entrepreneur — on subjects like the difference between the past and current generation, basic difference between ‘crush’ and ‘love’ and love marriages.

The interaction between the audience and the panellists was lively, interesting and informative.

146,['18/02/2020'],Hit-and-run: HC upholds Vismay Shah’s conviction,"This story is from February 18, 2020

Ahmedabad: The Gujarat high court on Monday upheld the conviction of Vismay Shah, 32, in the Vastrapur hit-and-run case in which two youths — Rahul Patel and Shivam Dave — were killed in February 2013. The court ordered Shah to surrender within six weeks to serve the remainder of his five-year jail term.

Justice Sonia Gokani rejected the appeal filed by Shah against his conviction on charges of rash driving and culpable homicide not amounting to murder and against his jail sentence. The HC also rejected the state government’s demand to enhance Shah’s punishment.

However, the HC imposed an additional fine of Rs 2 lakh on Shah besides the Rs 31,000 fine imposed by the trial court in July 2015. “The court may also impose additional punishment of social work but this will become clear once a copy of the order is available,” said additional public prosecutor Hardik Soni.

The HC lifted the stay on the trial against two witnesses, Lalit Gupta and Dinesh Chaudhary, and ordered the trial court to complete proceedings against them on perjury charges. The lower court decided to try them for perjury after they turned hostile in court. They were friends of the deceased boys and had testified about the accident before police.

While the appeal was pending before the high court, Shah struck a settlement with the parents of both the deceased boys. An affidavit filed by Patel’s father, Ghanshyam Patel, informed the high court that each of the two families received Rs 1.5 crore towards the settlement.

Before pronouncement of order, Justice Gokani inquired about the settlement amount. Shah’s advocate argued that since the compensation was paid by Shah to the victims’ families they had no issue with him. The court may take into consideration the satisfaction on the part of the parents while deciding Shah’s punishment, though the satisfaction of the parents and that of the court are two different issues.

PUNE: Huge quantities of debris and silt were removed from the Mula river near the Holkar bridge by the Khadi Cantonment Board (KCB)and the Bombay Engineering Group (BEG) and Centre in the past few days.

The Mula river passes through the cantonment area before merging with Mutha river at Sangamwadi . The four-km stretch of the river is unclean and often covered by hyacinth.

“A private contractor, who constructed the new bridge parallel to the Holkar bridge, had dumped construction debris on the riverbed which had disturbed the natural flow of water. Water used to accumulate in large quantities under the new bridge and the Holkar bridge and posed a health risk for residents living in the surrounding areas,” Pramod Kumar Singh, the KCB’s chief executive officer, told TOI.

He said, “The KCB, along with the army personnel from the BEG, worked on the project and removed debris with the help of earth movers over the past few days. The accumulated water was impure as several housing societies along the river in Vishrantwadi directly released untreated drainage water into the river. This has disturbed the river’s ecosystem completely. As for the water hyacinth, the Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation has hired a private agency and included the river stretch passing through the KCB limits for the work.”

Jubeda Akbar Ali

CHIKKAMAGALURU: Women are not usually allowed into burial grounds. But in NR Pura of Chikkamagaluru district , a Muslim woman has broken the barrier and won the hearts of locals.

Jubeda Akbar Ali, a 45-year-old Muslim widow, is member of the local town panchayat performs the last rites of unidentified bodies.

This mother of two girls also works as an ambulance driver. She graduated from Koppa First Grade College .

On Saturday, she transported the body of an unidentified person in his fifties in her ambulance and arranged the burial. “He had been ill for many days. After his death, the body was kept in the mortuary for many days. As no one came forward to claim it, we decided to bury it as per rules. As no relative was present, I offered prayers and did the burial,” she said.

She said her father wanted her to be involved in social service. She said: “I did my first burial in 2003. A woman’s body was being transported in a tractor used to dump garbage. That made me take up this service and provide dignified last rites. Now, if I come across an unidentified body, I organise the funeral and so far, I’ve buried 10 persons. I learnt driving when I was young and started driving the ambulance two years ago. Some persons donated an ambulance and I ferry patients, the destitute, among others, in it.”

For locals, she is a familiar face. “What makes her special is her decision to take up a challenging task like organising a burial for unclaimed bodies,” said Raju, a local resident.

149,['18/02/2020'],SCR announces monthly fee for auto &amp; taxi drivers,"This story is from February 18, 2020

Aurangabad: The South Central Railway (SCR) has announced monthly charges of Rs 350 and Rs 450 for autorickshaws and taxis, respectively for parking vehicles to pick passengers at Aurangabad railway station .

Besides Aurangabad, Nanded, Jalna and Parbhani railway stations have also witnessed this new fee that has sparked angry reactions from autorickshaw and taxi drivers. Other than the fee, these private transporters will also have to submit a police verification certificate for registration.

Moreover, apprehensions are being raised that charging of fee could discourage private transporters to venture on the premise of railway stations which in turn would cause hardship to passengers.

Nisar Ahmed Khan, leader of autorickshaw drivers in Aurangabad, said the railway officials have no right to levy monthly charges for stationing of rickshaws and taxis.

“It is unjust and unilateral decision. We cater to commuting needs of passengers and the railway authorities must keep this fact in mind before coming out with any arbitrary decision,” he said.

As per official record, around over 12,000 passengers book unreserved tickets from Aurangabad railway station every day, whereas the station witnesses footfall of over 34,000 passengers on any given day, including foreign tourists.

Keshav Mhaske, an auto driver, said he would avoid visiting the railway station to pick-up passengers. “We will not share an iota of our hard-earned money with the railway authorities. Instead, we will pick the passengers from other public places,” he said.

Meanwhile, SCR authorities said drivers/owners of autorickshaws and taxis will have to submit a written application along with vehicle documents, Aadhaar card and police verification for necessary registration.

“The practice of charging fee from autorickshaws and taxis is already in place in other divisions of the SCR and it is now being introduced in Nanded division. The move aims at streamlining traffic of private transporters and offer safe commuting to the passengers,” he said.

Construction work in full swing at the resort near Mukundara tiger reserve

JAIPUR: The forest department has issued notice to a resort owner near Kala Khuyi for illegal construction in the proposed eco-sensitive zone of Mukundara Hills Tiger Reserve .

After the ministry of environment and forests (MoEF) issued draft for declaring a radius of 1km at the reserve as eco-sensitive zone, the construction was started in full swing. A senior forest official at MHTR said, “The owner applied for no objection certificate (NoC) in district collectorate. Following this, an application was forwarded to us. We have turned down the proposal as it falls under the proposed ESZ. The final report from the ranger is awaited.”

After the notification was issued, villagers of Morkukala, Morkunj, Darrah and Kalikui have started protesting as this will prohibit all types of construction in their farms.

On January 10, the ministry had issued a draft notification to declare a 1km eco-sensitive zone around MHTR, which is spread over 759.99sqkm covering four districts of Kota, Bundi, Chittorgarh and Jhalawar. The ministry has sought suggestions and objections within 60 days. An official said, “So far, we have received only one objection from Morkukala. It is believed that the objections are directly submitted on MoEF website.”

A senior forest official said the eco-sensitive zones will be treated as a ‘breathing space’ for wildlife. It is demarcated based on their ecological importance which reins in development activities inimical to wildlife and their habitats. While the zone will be completely compatible to livelihoods of local communities living around the tiger reserve, it will bring the order on tourism, mining activities, industries and other footloose development activities disrupting wildlife corridors outside the reserve boundary.

Secunderabad: Civic works that have been pending in all eight civilian wards of Secunderabad Cantonment for over a year may soon get a push as the Ministry of Defence (MoD) has approved the release of Rs 100 crore grant-in-aid to the cash-starved Secunderabad Cantonment Board (SCB).

In each civilian ward, works worth at least Rs 2 crore to Rs 3 crore were proposed at several SCB general body meetings, however, the works have remained pending due to the SCB’s deep financial crisis.

Last June, the SCB had urged the MoD to sanction Rs 100 crore as ‘grant-in-aid’ to help it tide over the financial crisis and take up pending civic works.

“Responding to our plea, the MoD has agreed to sanction Rs 100 crore for completion of civic works in Cantonment areas,” SCB officials told TOI.

Pandu Yadav, an SCB ward member, said, “As our tenures have been extended by another six months, we have an opportunity to get pending projects completed. In ward number 6, works regarding sewerage network and laying of water pipelines and CC Roads are pending. I can complete at least a few works that need to be carried out immediately once the SCB releases the funds .”

Another ward member said that he plans to complete at least 60% of the pending works. “Residents are already complaining about drinking water problem and borewells are also drying up. I need to get 30 borewells repaired in my ward,” he said.

Veerabhadra Nath, a resident of Bowenpally, said that instead of constructing community halls, ward members must first resolve issues of poor sewerage network.

In fact, the long wait to get the state government’s share of entertainment tax and other taxes to the tune of Rs 60 crore to Rs 80 crore has been pending for over five years. “We will get a little respite if the state government takes the initiative to release these pending taxes,” said a senior official of the Secunderabad Cantonment Board.

154,['18/02/2020'],Gandhi’s ‘Gram Swaraj’ is still a dream: Writer,"This story is from February 18, 2020

Mysuru: Writer Rupa Hassan on Monday regretted the sorry state of affairs in rural India and said the ‘Gram Swaraj’ vision of Mahatma Gandhi has failed.

Speaking at the meet on Gandhian ideals hosted as part of Bahuroopi, she said villages in the country are becoming dumping ground for urban waste, where inequality and discrimination based on caste and gender are still rampant. The present economic policies have rendered farmers’ lives miserable. There was a time when farmers were self-sufficient for their daily family needs. But now they have to depend on the government and multinational companies for seeds, fertilizers, loans, subsidies and ultimately for the survival and their families, she observed.

Mahatama Gandhi had strongly believed in the development of model villages by promoting human effort-centric sustainable living and promotion of cottage industries. But this vision has not materialised even today, she rued.

“Gandhi had also dreamt of decentralization of political and economic powers. But we are seeing concentration of money and power in a few hands. He stressed on women’s safety. But unfortunately, rape and atrocities on women have become the order of the day,” she pointed out.

Despite Gandhi’s warning about the ill-effects of alcohol, the governments have been giving licence to open more and more liquor shops. Shockingly, the number of people drinking liquor is increasing at the rate of 18% every year. The government is also encouraging prostitution by distribution of condoms and contraceptives through rehabilitated prostitutes, she alleged.

Social activist Kadashettyhalli Satish was present.

155,['18/02/2020'],Jaipur: Mining body wants leases on first-come basis,"This story is from February 18, 2020

The mining industry wants the newly imposed land tax lifted

JAIPUR: For bringing in transparency and enhancing revenues for the state, the Federation of Mining Associations of Rajasthan (FMAR) has urged the state government to follow the system of ‘first come first serve’ route for granting mining leases to khatedar or its NOC holder.

In its budget recommendations to the state government, FMAR also said the newly imposed land tax on mining leases should be lifted to provide relief to the mine operators.

“The government should reconsider the process of issuing mining leases on first come first serve basis in addition to auction route. For mineral deposits in khatedari land, application route by khatedar or his registered NOC holder should be adopted which would invite better response from investors. If the application model is used, it will remove uncertainties and development will see faster implementation,” said Akshaydeep Mathur, secretary general of FAMR.

Similarly, Mathur said up to 25% of government land adjacent to or inside khatedari land should be included in the mining leases for safe and scientific mining.

The industry body urged the government to make changes in the registration fees. Currently, the fee is charged as a percentage of the DLC rate prevailing in the area. But Mathur said since mining leases do not provide ownership, the calculation of registration fee should be based on the dead rent fees.

“Till 2007, registration fees in case of new leases and transfer used to be calculated as a percentage of twice dead-rent fees. Recently, this has been changed to a percentage of 4-times of the DLC rate of the land falling inside the mining lease. Since mining leases does not award ownership, dead rent method should be followed,” Mathur said.

The land tax, which was withdrawn by the Congress government in 2013, has again been re-imposed from November 2019 on leases above 10 hectares. Mathur said land tax is detrimental to the growth of mining industry as it imposes financial hardship on the lease holder.

“Mining lease holders are already paying heavy amount to the DMF fund for betterment of the society. The federation has requested the government to withdraw the tax. Legal validity of land tax to be imposed by state governments is already under review of the SC and as such the matter is subjudice,” Mathur added.

FAMR also suggested the government to bring in a separate policy for sands and not club it with mining policy. “There is no value addition to sands like other minerals,” Mathur said.

Even though mining in Rajasthan takes place in 0.7% of the land area, it currently contributes the highest non-tax revenue to the state and provides employment opportunities, both directly and indirectly, to 30 lakh people.

Some 17 cases of gold seizures involving 8.3kg of gold were reported in January 2020 at the city airport. On the other hand, some 33 cases involving 17.5kg gold were reported in the first fortnight of February. Sixteen passengers were arrested by officials of Ahmedabad customs in the first fifteen days of February.

The value of gold seized during these two months is Rs 10.5 crore. Sources revealed that the most common modus operandi was capsules in one’s rectum. Other ways include bars concealed in false bottoms and handles of bags, in the form of belts or concealed in layers of clothing.

Most of those arrested were travelling from Dubai and Sharjah in UAE, Kuwait, Doha in Qatar and Bangkok in Thailand. “Most of those arrested are from Punjab, Rajasthan, UP, Maharashtra and Kerala, among other states of India,” said a source in Ahmedabad customs.

159,['18/02/2020'],New scheme proposes water meters for all consumers,"This story is from February 18, 2020

Aurangabad: In a major development, the Aurangabad municipal commissioner stated that under the new water supply scheme, electric water meters are proposed to be installed for all water consumers. Once that is in place, the Delhi model of free water — up to a certain limit — can be implemented in the city, he said.

Incidentally, a new water supply scheme worth Rs 1,680 crore to meet the water supply needs of the city until 2051 is in the tendering process. The new scheme will have the capacity to supply 605 million litres per day (MLD) to the city.

Currently, the AMC charges household water consumers Rs 4,050 annually towards water tax. The civic body has been widely criticised for the exorbitant tax rate. According to social activist Vijay Diwan, the water tax in Aurangabad is the highest in the country — especially keeping in mind the fact that the civic body supplies water only once in 6 days.

During his interaction with the press on Monday, AMC commissioner Astik Kumar Pandey was asked about the administration’s take on reducing the water tax. Pandey agreed that the tax system is unjust. “I am of the opinion that the water tax rates should be less and that all consumers should be brought under the tax net. For the new water scheme, we have received a green signal from the state government to install water meters for all consumers. The water metering will ensure that the consumer only pays for the water used,” Pandey said.

He added that once the water meters are installed, the AMC can implement a Delhi-like system in which consumers can be supplied free water up to a certain quantity.

Around half of water consumers do not pay tax

The AMC has the data of 1.3 lakh water consumers in the city. However, there are an estimated 1.2 lakh water consumers who are currently out of the tax net. The AMC is in the process of screening the water consumer data received from the private company, which had been managing the city’s water supply for two years until September 2016. Meanwhile, in order to regularise illegal water connections, the AMC has planned to initiate a drive. The drive is yet to be implemented.

But only a few know that a variety of migratory birds that fly in from as far as Europe also spread around at water bodies across the city. These birds arrive in November and fly out by February every year. TOI takes a sneak peek into these local bird paradise.

Timbi Lake (Waghodia)

It is the second most frequented wetland after Wadhwana. Located 12km east of the city in Waghodia taluka, Timbi lake attracts a large number of migratory birds. Over 124 species including resident and migratory birds visit this lake every year. From black night stork to red crested pochard and greater painted snipe to tufted duck, this lake is home to many migratory species.

Kotana (Mahi River)

It is one of the serene spots where you can walk up to Mahi River and spot some beautiful birds. Kotana is an unexplored place just ahead of a popular hangout spot for youngsters – Sindhrot. One can reach river bank in Kotana through the village. From brahmini duck to mallard duck, Siberian stonechat, Eurasian curlew and northern pintail, bird enthusiasts can spot 15 to 20 species in this wetland in this village.

Jawla Lake (Savli)

Located about 30km away from the city, Jawala Lake is yet another haven for the migratory birds because of its rich flora and fauna. This water body is surrounded by lush green fields and tall grasses that are home to a variety of munia birds. From grey lag geese, black cormorants, pond heron, red munias, coots to blue rock pigeons, nearly 80 species are spotted here.

Luna (Padra)

This non-descript village in Padra taluka is home to over 100 painted storks which have made the pond in Luna their permanent home. Located about 15km from the city, the pond also hosts common coots, rosy starlings, purple moorhen to scaly breasted munia, little egret and pond heron. The locals too protect the birds in their natural habitat.

Representative image

LUCKNOW: Over 56 lakh candidates will appear for the UP Secondary Education Board class X, XII examinations which begin on Tuesday. Almost 30 lakh class X students will be taking elementary Hindi and 26 lakh class XII students are appearing for general Hindi exam on day one. The exam is being held at 7,784 centres across the state. Both high school (class X) and intermediate (class XII) exams will end on March 6.

A total of 56.1 lakh candidates have registered for the examinations, over two lakh less than the 58.6 lakh in 2019. In class X, out of 30 lakh candidates who registered online, 20,789 would appear as private candidates. Out of 26 lakh candidates who had registered for class XII exams, 69,983 are private candidates. To crack down on copying mafia who facilitate mass cheating in UP Board exams , the UP government has set up a state-level ‘monitoring and control room’ for CCTV surveillance and to monitor voice recordings. To keep a close vigil, nearly 2 lakh CCTV cameras have been installed at 7,784 centres in 75 districts of UP. Around 2 lakh invigilators have been put on duty. Uttar Pradesh Secondary Education Board (UPSEB) has identified 938 centres as ‘sensitive’ and 395 as ‘hyper-sensitive’ which means these centres are vulnerable for cheating. Sensitive districts will use colour-coded and threaded answer-copies. The class X answer-copies will be pink and yellow and that of class XII will be green and blue. The idea is to ensure that they can’t be replaced or their pages taken out by any unauthorised person.

In a first, the UP government has launched a Twitter handle, @upboardexam2020 for immediate redressal of any kind of complaints and queries. In addition, helpline numbers for the control room — 1800 180 6607, 0522-2239198 and e-mail id: boardexam2020.up@gmail.com and toll free numbers 1800 180 5310 and 1800 180 5312 can be used to register complaints of anything related to UP Board exams.

165,['18/02/2020'],Civic chief asks contractors to sponsor dividers for new roads under CSR funds,"This story is from February 18, 2020

Aurangabad: The Aurangabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) has decided to install road dividers through the contractors, who are undertaking Rs 100 crore cement road projects. The work will be done as a penalty on the contractors for failing to meet deadlines.

Incidentally, the concretising work of 30 city roads at the cost of Rs 100 crore was initiated in January 2019 through four contractors. As per the work order, the project should have been completed by December 31, 2019. However, this deadline was missed with roads far from completion.

According to city engineer Sakharam Panzade, the work on 20 out of 30 roads have been 100 percent completed by Monday. The work on six roads is under progress and on four roads the work has not been initiated due to various reasons.

The factors which delayed the work include the inability of the AMC to clear the encroachments, failure to shift utilities on time and other technical issues. However, in some cases, the contractors have not been able to complete the project on time in spite of no issues.

Municipal commissioner Astik Kumar Pandey on Monday stated that the contractors, who caused the delay will have to be either penalised or blacklisted for failing to meet the deadline. “As the road dividers were not covered in the road project. We are asking the contractors if they can use two percent of their CSR funds to install road dividers. Instead of the concrete road dividers, we have decided that plantation will be done in the middle of the road and this will be covered with an iron net to work as a divider,” Pandey said. The municipal commissioner said that the decision has been taken for the benefit of people.

Separate DPR for footpath and stormwater drain

Meanwhile, city engineer Sakharam Panzade said that the constructing work of footpaths and stormwater drains along with the newly constructed roads would cost more. “We are in the process of preparing a detailed project report (DPR) for the footpaths and stormwater drains. This DPR worth Rs 25 crore will be presented to the state government for its approval as the AMC is financially incapable of funding the project,” Panzade said.

Members of Parsi community release a book in the city on Monday

Lucknow: Members of Parsi community in Lucknow on Monday urged the administration to free their properties of encroachments and help in its preservation.

Speaking at the book launch of ‘Bharat Ka Parsi Samaj’ by Dr Naresh Singh, president of Avadh Girls’ Degree College, Zarine Viccajee, whose family was one of the first settlers from the community in Lucknow, said: “Parsis have contributed to the country’s development and continues to do so in different fields. But the community’s strength is dwindling. Today, 40 Parsi families reside in the city as compared to 300 earlier.”

“Be it Lucknow or Delhi, we mingled with people wherever we settled. At a time when only limited number of Parsis are there to keep their heritage and culture alive in Lucknow, a few places like 73-year-old Parsi Anjuman and the graveyard need to be preserved,” she said.

“In our religion, we let the bodies of the dead decompose naturally. This is why Mumbai has the ‘Tower of Silence’. Lucknow has no such place, therefore, we go for burial,” Viccajee added.

Highlighting the history of the community, president of Lucknow Parsi Community Homi Sipai said it was Nauroji Damkewala, a trader of silk and pearls from Gujarat, who first settled in Lucknow during the times of third king of Awadh Mohammad Ali Shah.

“Gradually, a number of families started settling in the city. Most of the families stayed in the compound of Parsi Anjuman. We made Lucknow our home and embraced the city’s lifestyle,” he said. The members also expressed concern over the fact that their festivals, Navroz and Khordad Sal, were not declared public holidays.

Hyderabad: Rising temperatures have paved way for an early summer in Hyderabad with maximum temperatures already touching 33-35 degree Celsius in many parts of the city.

At 33.6 degree Celsius, the maximum temperature already spiralled beyond normal temperatures on Monday for the month of February.

Sudden showers on February 10 had brought down mercury levels by nine degree Celsius to 23.4 degree Celsius. However, within a week, the maximum temperatures have returned to 33 degree Celsius, giving a teaser of what could be in store over the next few months.

According to the Telangana State Development Planning Society, Tolichowki, Quthbullapur, Lingampally, Khairtabad, Nagole and Musheerabad are a few areas which are already experiencing high temperatures of up to 35 degree Celsius. Last year, the mercury levels had touched 37.3 degree Celsius only by February 27. This year too, meteorologists expect a similar trend wherein mercury levels are only expected to rise.

“Given the prevailing weather conditions, we can say that summer has already made inroads into the city. We can expect a gradual rise of two to three degree Celsius over the next few days,” said Naga Ratna, director, India Meteorology Department (IMD), Hyderabad.

After experiencing a warm winter, meteorologists forecast that summer will be equally harsh with the maximum temperatures expected to rise further due to prevalence of southeasterly winds over Telangana.

“As the sun’s position over the globe is shifting towards the northern hemisphere day by day, conditions are favourable for further increase in temperatures. The weather is likely to remain dry over most parts of the state,” read a weather report issued by Skymet, a private weather forecasting agency.

It further added that days will be very warm while the nights will be pleasant. The sky will remain mainly clear as surface winds will be light.

168,['18/02/2020'],Cosmos Bank recovers Rs 5.73 crore moved to Hong Kong account,"This story is from February 18, 2020

Representative image

PUNE: A sustained follow-up by the cybercrime branch of the Pune police has led to the recovery of Rs 5.73 crore from a frozen account of a private bank in Hong Kong.

The money is part of the Rs 94.42 crore siphoned off in a sensational online heist from the city-based Cosmos Cooperative Bank in August 2018. “The money was moved to the Cosmos Bank on Monday following an order by a court in Hong Kong on Saturday,” deputy commissioner of police (cyber) Sambhaji Kadam said.

He said it was the first instalment of the Rs10 crore they were expecting to recover from the frozen account in Hong Kong. “The suspects behind the online heist had effected a Rs13.92 crore transfer to this account and further siphoned off Rs3 crore from this account before the authorities managed to freeze it,” he added.

A court in Hong Kong had ordered the account to be frozen after the Pune police and their legal team put forth their case for such action. The Hong Kong police too had assisted the Pune police in the matter following the latter’s request. Besides, officials from the Ministry of External Affairs played an important role in the follow-up.

“The Hong Kong court heard the case and directed the bank and other authorities to transfer 802,283.65 US Dollars (Rs 5.73 crore) to Cosmos Bank,” Kadam said, adding that further deliberations and follow-up action is in progress for the recovery of the remainder of the Rs10 crore in the frozen account.

Senior inspector Jayram Paygude and other cybercrime officials pursued the matter with the counterparts in Hong Kong. A legal team from the Cosmos Bank too chipped in. They had discussed matters with the authorities in Hong Kong which yielded positive results, Kadam said.

Unidentified hackers had infiltrated the Cosmos Bank’s online system to siphon off Rs 94.42 crore in two strikes on August 11 and 13, 2018. The suspects deployed two modus operandi for effecting the heist. They used a malware to hack into the bank’s server and created a parallel virtual server containing details of the bank. The virtual server then approved the fraudulent transactions.

During investigations, the police realized that 12,000 unauthorised transactions worth Rs 78 crore took place using the VISA card facility of the bank. The money was mainly transferred outside India. Also, 2,849 illegal transactions worth Rs 2.5 crore took place within India using the Rupay card facility of the bank. The money was withdrawn by agents of the fraudsters based in 21 countries, using duplicate ATM cards.

Investigations also revealed that the suspects executed three suspicious transactions using the bank’s SWIFT (Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication ) facility. Through these transactions, a sum of Rs 13.92 crore was transferred from the Cosmos Bank to the account of a trading company with its office in Hong Kong. The account of the company was with the private bank. The sum of Rs5.73 crore is part of this amount, the police said.

Paygude said the cybercrime police have so far arrested 18 people, mostly agents, who effected withdrawals using duplicate ATM cards, from Kolhapur, Mumbai, Ahmedabad, Ajmer, Indore and other cities, and cash Rs10 lakh have been recovered from them.

Dr Kafeel Khan

AGRA: Gorakhpur pediatrician Dr Kafeel Khan who was booked under National Security Act (NSA) by Aligarh police will submit his reply to UP State Advisory Board through the Mathura Jail authorities on Tuesday.

Confirming this, Khan’s lawyer, Irfan Ghazi , said though the response, as per the magistrate’s directions, has to be sent through the jail superintendent, the doctor wants to physically represent his case to the advisory board. Ghazi termed as “incorrect” Aligarh police and district authorities’ allegations that on December 12, Khan’s speech to AMU students had sparked protests on university campus. He said in the same context, there were protests by women in Shahjamal area from January 29 and the same continued till date. He said all the grounds made by the administration in support of booking Khan under NSA are baseless.

The lawyer said in his reply, Khan has said that he had given a speech on December 12 whereas the protests on AMU campus had already started on December 9. He said Khan had spent only a day on AMU campus and had returned after delivering his speech. The violence witnessed on campus had taken place on December 15, when Khan was not there and it was in reaction to the Jamia Millia Islamia incident in Delhi.

Ghazi said UP government had been indulging in a witch-hunt against Khan in retaliation for raising his voice against the negligence by government in the death of 63 children at the BRD Medical College Hospital in Gorakhpur in 2016. It may be recalled that Khan was then suspended, arrested and later released on bail. Though Khan was given a clean chit by the medical college authorities for his involvement in the death of the infants, the state government had launched a new departmental investigation against him for allegedly spreading incorrect information about the inquiry report and for making “anti-government” remarks during his suspension.

According to the FIR, in his speech, Khan had allegedly said that “CAA will make us second-grade citizens” and that “Mota Bhai” teaches us to be Hindus or Muslims. He had further said, “This fight is for our existence. We have to fight.” Khan also stated that students in RSS school are being taught that those who have beards are terrorists. He said through CAA, the government had showed that India is not “our” country.

Rescuers searching for survivors near Bhimpura village on Monday

Vadodara: In a repeat of an incident that took place at Sisva village near the city last week, three persons on Monday morning fell in the Narmada canal near Bhimpura village on the outskirts of the city as the bike rider lost control over the vehicle.

A teenager Laxman Parmar who was sitting pillion was saved as he came out of the water with the help of his bag and then held a plant on the bank of the canal. Firemen unsuccessfully searched for the other two – Vaibhav Valand (25) and Gopal Parmar (22) – till late Monday evening. Rescuers searched for four kilometres downstream of the canal on Monday using boats.

According to 16-year-old Laxman, the trio was going to Gorwa BIDC from their native Kosindra village in Anand district. Vaibhav and Gopal work at Gorwa BIDC and daily commute on the bike. Laxman tagged along with them as the duo wanted to show him around the place where they work. Initially, Laxman had denied but when he was promised that they will return early, he agreed. Laxman told firemen that while taking sharp turn along the canal road near Bhimpura village Vaibhav lost control over the two-wheeler and the bike went straight into the canal.

Fire officials said that while holding the plant, Laxman shouted plant hearing which passers-by came to his help. Later the firemen fished out the bike but Vaibhav and Gopal were untraceable. “There are strong currents in the water due to which the two men could not be found on Monday. On Tuesday, the National Disaster Response Force will also join the search,” a fire official said.

On February 15, a sedan car had fallen in a pond at Sisva village when the driver had lost control over the vehicle at a curve on the road. One passenger sitting on the backseat was drowned and two others were rescued.

171,['18/02/2020'],Hot run-up to summer as real-feel hits 35°C,"This story is from February 18, 2020

Pune: Day temperatures have touched the season’s highest in the city and are likely to reach another high soon with the India Meteorological Department (IMD) forecasting the temperature to rise to 35ºC in the next few days.

On Monday, the day temperatures in Shivajinagar and Lohegaon were a warm 33.7ºC and 34.1ºC, respectively. These were the highest day temperatures in the 2019-2020 winter for Pune city.

It’s already feeling like summer, with the sunny afternoons pushing up the city’s “real feel” temperature to 35-plus degrees C, around one to two notches higher than the actual. With the night temperatures remaining high, the heat load over Pune has gone up significantly.

This is a stark contrast to what was witnessed during the same period last year. On February 17 in 2019, the city’s night temperature was 10.8º C. On Monday, it was a warm 16.1ºC in Shivajinagar.

A senior IMD scientist told TOI that summer-like conditions have already started prevailing in the city and parts of the state. “Slight chill is present in seven to eight districts in the state — in parts of Vidarbha and north Marathwada, north Madhya Maharashtra. But the chill factor seems to have left Konkan and almost 70% of north to central and south Madhya Maharashtra, including Pune,” he said.

“The minimum temperatures are likely to rise further in the city during the next 5-7 days. The day temperatures may touch a warm 34-35ºC during the next few days,” the official said.

The city is currently experiencing warm afternoons and nights. “Though there is a slight chance of partial northerly wind component entering north Maharashtra on February 18-19, the flow is likely to be countered by the southeasterly/southerly winds,” he said.

The northerly winds are cooler winds originating from north India, while the southeasterly/southerly winds come from the southeast and southern regions, respectively, and are relatively warmer.

“Though some northerly wind component will be trickling in from one side, the southeasterly/southerly winds will be penetrating parts of the state from the other side, resulting in their interaction. The presence of the northerly winds may not make much difference in night temperatures, which are expected to stay high in Pune district and Konkan during that time,” the scientist said.

The current day temperatures are a stark contrast from what the readings showed a few days ago, when below-30 degrees C temperatures were being witnessed in Pune. On February 9, the day temperature in Shivajinagar was a pleasant 27.4 degrees C. In Lohegaon the same day, it was 28.2º C, below normal by 3.8ºC in both the locations.

AHMEDABAD: Bucking fear of a slowdown in the global economy, McKinsey & Company, a management consultancy major, made 27 offers to IIM-Ahmedabad (IIM-A) students who were part of PGP 2020 final placements. According to IIM-A sources, this figure is the highest for the firm at IIM-A and also the highest among the top IIMs this year.

Boston Consulting Group (BCG) was second highest with 23 offers, cementing management consultancy as the top choice for IIM-A grads, in line with the trend over the past few years. Close to 400 students were placed over three days.

Other major recruiters were TCS with 12 offers, MasterCard and FinIQ with 11 offers each, Avendus and Amazon with 10 offers each, JP Morgan and AB InBev with 8 offers each, Airtel and Microsoft with 7 offers each and CK Birla Group with 6 offers to name a few. A total of 153 companies participated with 182 different roles in 20-plus cohorts.

Prof Amit Karna, chairperson of the placement committee at IIM-A, said that given the economic scenario, they were apprehensive about the results. “The outcome has not only been more positive than expected, but also better than in previous years,” he said. “With our consistent record of producing high achievers, we continued to attract several new recruiters expanding our recruiter pool considerably.”

He added that about 40% of the batch exercised the ‘dream application’ option that allowed them to sit for interviews even after having an offer from one cluster.

173,['18/02/2020'],Milind Deora’s praise for AAP sparks spat with Ajay Maken,"This story is from February 18, 2020

NEW DELHI: Senior Congress functionaries Milind Deora and Ajay Maken were involved in a spat on Twitter after the former praised the Arvind Kejriwal-led Delhi government for doubling its revenue. Former Delhi Congress chief Maken criticised Deora for his “half-baked facts” and said he may leave the party if he wished to. This forced the party to intervene and urge its members to desist from lauding AAP .

Deora’s tweet came days after Congress faced questions from within about party seniors celebrating the AAP win. “Sharing a lesser known and welcome fact — Kejriwal-led Delhi government doubled its revenues to Rs 60,000 crore and maintained a revenue surplus over the last five years. Food for thought: Delhi is now one of India's most fiscally prudent governments,” Deora tweeted.

It invited a strong riposte from Maken who tweeted, “Brother, you want to leave Congress, please do. Then propagate half-baked facts.” He said the compound annual growth rate during Congress government in Delhi was over 14% while it was 9.9% in AAP’s tenure.

The bitter response appeared to allude to speculation about Deora looking to leave Congress, a speculation that he has already quashed in interviews.

But it did not end there as Deora got back to Maken with an equally biting counter-punch. “Brother, I would never undermine Sheila Dikshit’s stellar performance as Delhi CM. That’s your speciality. But it is never too late to change. Instead of advocating an alliance with AAP, if only you had highlighted Sheilaji’s achievements, Congress would have been in power today,” he shot back, underlining the rivalry that existed between Maken and Dikshit who passed away recently. This was also seen as a reference to Maken’s anxiety to have an alliance with AAP for last year’s Lok Sabha polls.

The nasty exchange stemmed from Deora’s praise for AAP which swept the Delhi polls in which Congress again failed to open its account. While many Congress functionaries have been celebrating that AAP defeated rival BJP in a polarised campaign, it has miffed insiders who argue that Congress members should be concerned about the party’s wipeout. As the Deora-Maken clash dominated the discourse on Monday, Congress repeated its appeal to partymen to focus on their responsibilities instead of commenting on others, which it said would strengthen the organisation.

At the same time, party spokesman Randeep Surjewala came out on the side of Maken by saying Kejriwal had done nothing great on the revenue side as tax collections in Delhi had historically been high.

He said AAP had benefited from the development work done by Dikshit government. Surjewala said sometimes in the heat of the moment, people made remarks but every such statement was not treated as an affront.

Ahmedabad: A 22-year-old woman from the Zundal area in city on Sunday filed a complaint alleging her five in-laws had beaten her when she asked about her husband.

In her FIR with Chandkheda police, the woman said that she had contacted her husband on Facebook around 18 months ago and they fell in love.

She had married the man 10 months ago, but it did not go well with her husband’s family. The woman and her husband began living at Zundal after their marriage to avoid quarrels with her husband’s family members. She stated in the FIR that she had gone to attend her ailing uncle in Radhanpur on February 10 while her husband stayed at their house in Zundal.

When she returned the next day, she did not find her husband at home and she filed an application to file complaint at Adalaj police station. She came to know on Sunday that her husband was at her in-laws’ place in Chandkheda. When she went there to inquire, her in-laws beat her and pushed her out of their house.

175,['18/02/2020'],Officials without ‘measuring books’ will be booked,"This story is from February 18, 2020

Aurangabad: Directives have been sent out to the civic department officials warning them of FIRs if they fail to produce the measurement books (MBs) while verifying bills produced by civic contractors.

A measurement book, maintained by officials of various government departments, has records of all civic projects carried out in a city. It serves as a record of cost, bills, scale of work done and payments made to procure equipment and labour. An MB is critical when approving contractor bills.

Last year, as many as 250 contractors working with the Aurangabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) held a 78-day protest outside the civic body’s office to seek settlement of dues. Their strike was called off on December 19 after municipal commissioner Astik Kumar Pandey promised that the AMC would restart payments after verification of bills submitted by the contractors.

Pandey then formed nine squads for nine zones of the city that were tasked with the verification of all civil works. But the squads soon found out that MBs of many civic works, such as road construction and water pipeline work, were missing.

The civic commissioner said FIRs would now be registered against officials who have lost the MBs.

He added that payments to contractors will not be made in cases where MBs are missing. “These officials are custodians of the MBs. And if they fail to produce the documents, we will be filing FIRs against them,” he said.

176,['18/02/2020'],"No new hiring before civic polls, says commissioner","This story is from February 18, 2020

Aurangabad: The civic administration will not be initiating any new recruitments before the Aurangabad Municipal Corporation elections.

The AMC has sent the staffing pattern proposal to the state government to increase the approved posts. In the meeting held on January 7, the general body of the AMC had scrapped the new proposal staffing pattern proposal and had asked the AMC administration to send the old proposal to the state government for its approval.

After one-and-a-half months, the municipal commissioner has signed the proposal and it has been sent to the urban development department of the state government. On Monday, municipal commissioner Astik Kumar Pandey stated that the AMC has also sought the permission from the state government to recruit staff for the existing vacant posts.

There are 444 vacant posts in the AMC, for Classes I to III employees. Due to the lack of manpower, the civic body often fails to conduct its business properly. The staff shortage especially takes a toll during the tax recovery process. The AMC always fails to achieve its annual tax recovery target and as a result, development works are not being taken up on time. The poorly staffed water works department also requires the existing employees to work extra hours.

However, when asked if the AMC plans on hiring employees to fill the existing vacant posts, Pandey said since the elections are approaching, it will require the resources and funds of the AMC.

“Recruitment is an extensive process, which if once started, will require all our focus. So, after the elections, we will most likely get the approval of the state government of the staffing pattern proposal and then we can carry out the recruitment process,” Pandey said.

BIJNOR: Ahead of summer season, forest officials are planning to construct two borewells with solar pumps in Amangarh Tiger Reserve to provide drinking water for animals. The step is being taken to maintain adequate levels in the waterholes.

Sources said that the step would also minimise man -animal conflict in the region as animals often move towards human settlements in search of water during peak summer.

Bijnor divisional forest officer M Semmaran said, “The move is aimed at maintaining water in ponds and holes so that animals can quench their thirst. Besides, these pumps will help in putting out wildfires too.” “There is no provision to lay power lines in forest areas. Hence, solar pumps will help in extracting groundwater. In the first phase, two solar pumps will be installed at a cost of Rs 20 lakh,” he added.

According to officials, forest department had sent a proposal to the higher authorities for installing four solar pumps in ATR. However, only two have been sanctioned this year. While one is close to Jhirna range of Corbett reserve, the other will be at Phakkad crossing of ATR.

Officials said that the pumps are being installed as ground water is found at a level of 300 feet in the region.

Amangarh Tiger Reserve is home to over 22 tigers, 25 leopards and a large number of herbivores. There are 12 waterholes in the reserve that attract wild animals.

179,['18/02/2020'],Ayodhya outlay to define BJP agenda for Uttar Pradesh 2022 assembly elections,"This story is from February 18, 2020

LUCKNOW: Budgetary sanctions for schemes run by the UP culture and tourism departments for financial year 2021 will outline ruling BJP’s agenda for the 2022 assembly elections.

Sources said that both the Centre and state governments are banking largely on the Ram Temple to showcase their achievements in 2022. Officials in the two departments have held several brainstorming sessions to give a large share to Ayodhya.

“The central government has already formed a trust for construction of the temple. But a lot has to be done around it. Both culture and tourism departments are pitching in with the best,” said a senior officer. It is for this that the state government has proposed setting up of the Ramjanmabhoomi Teertha development board.

The board — which will pool in funds from various departments, particularly culture and tourism — will be responsible for development of tourist facilities of international standards in the temple town. Sources said that activities worth Rs 250 crore have been charted for implementation for the first two years.

Also, projects related to the towering Ram statue and Navya Ayodhya are most likely to get their due. The list includes building gardens, theme park, five star hotels, digital museum and convention centre. Likewise, the state may contribute towards the ongoing facelift of the Ayodhya railway station being done by the ministry of railways.

Budgetary sanctions for Ayodhya may come from other heads as well. Projects to improve road and air connectivity with Ayodhya are also on the anvil. According to officials, the CM wants the bus terminus in Ayodhya to be augmented to be able to hold 3,000-4000 buses at a time. Likewise, allocation for the medical college in Ayodhya is also expected through the medical education department.

Push to religious tourism has always been the top priority of Yogi government since the budget placed in 2017.

Significant budgetary sanctions were made for development of tourist facilities in Varanasi (Rs 200 crore for cultural centre), Gorakhpur (Rs 25 crore for development of Ramgarh Taal) and Vindhyanchal (Rs 10 crore for infrastructure building), in addition to allocations for Ayodhya (Rs 3 crore for Ramayana Conclave) and Mathura-Braj region. The government also organised the first grand Diwali celebrations in Ayodhya and scaled up the Holi celebrations in Brij.

In 2018, sanctions for Mathura-Vrindavan were made. The government also formed the Braj Teerth Vikas Parishad to promote religious tourism in the region. Besides, projects in Ayodhya and Varanasi were allocated more funds.

In 2019-20s the tourism department provided for Rs 125 crore for infrastructural facilities in Uttar Pradesh Braj Teerth, while Rs 101 crore was proposed for integrated development of major tourist places in Ayodhya. Among other projects, culture and tourism departments provided construction of boundary walls around Ramlila ground in different cities.

The Bund Garden police have seized the truck

PUNE: A security guard (40) of a private company engaged in the construction of the Pune Metro project died after a truck hit him on the Raja Bahadur Mill road on Monday morning while he was on his way to collect salary.

The Bund Garden police said Siddharth, alias Raju Pandurang Kamble of Mangalwar Peth, was on leave on Monday and had gone to the company’s office to collect his salary.

Hyderabad: Wondering why the state is shying away from filing its counter in a public interest litigation (PIL) which questioned the attitude of the government in keeping almost half of its government orders (GOs) away from public gaze and the huge number of secret GOs that are not accessible to the citizens, the Telangana high court on Monday directed the Telangana government to file its counter by February 28.

A bench of Chief Justice Raghavendra Singh Chauhan and Justice A Abhishek Reddy gave this direction while hearing the PIL filed by BJP activist Perala Sekhar Rao, questioning the state’s action in not keeping all GOs in public domain.

“The state is allowed to keep certain sensitive orders away from the public domain, but all GOs cannot be brought under this category,” the petitioner said. Of the nearly a lakh GOs the state had issued between June, 2014, and August, 2019, as many as 42,000 GOs were marked ‘secret’ and made inaccessible to the public, he said. All important GOs should be uploaded on the state website and an officer has to be appointed to see that these GOs were properly uploaded and the state website properly maintained, he said. The bench too questioned the state counsel as to why the government did not file its counter though a direction was given to do so in September 2019 itself.

JAIPUR: A feud on a whatsapp group between Chomu’s BJP MLA Ramlal Sharma and SDM Himmat Singh prompted the MLA to reach the collectorate on Monday and take up the matter with district collector Joga Ram. The MLA also raised the issue with Assembly speaker C P Joshi, who assured him of proper action and referring the matter to the privileges committee.

""I had raised questions in the assembly regarding the number of names added and deleted under the food security act. But, I didn't get a satisfactory reply from the government. I had complained regarding this to the speaker and appropriate action was taken,"" Sharma told TOI.

“Following this, the SDM made the issue public on a WhatsApp group. That's why I complained to the collector about the SDM's misconduct on social media. I also met the speaker today and informed him about it. I also told him it is my right to raise questions about the schemes.

Joga Ram said, ""He (the MLA) has not submitted any written application. I will look into the matter. It (the complaint) was about the functioning of the SDM.""

Meanwhile, Himmat Singh said, ""He (MLA) has a problem with the process of adding names of eligible persons under the food security act. I add the names in a very transparent and unbiased manner. It was Sharmaji who first mentioned on the WhatsApp group that action will be taken against the SDM by the speaker. So, I replied that names of eligible persons will only be added.

NEW DELHI: Disapproving the continuing blockade at Shaheen Bagh and expressing the hope that good sense would prevail over anti-CAA agitators leading them to vacate the road and shift their protest to an alternative site, the Supreme Court on Monday asked senior advocates Sanjay Hegde, Sadhana Ramachandran and former chief information commissioner Wajahat Habibullah to hold consultations with the agitators.

Though a bench of Justices Sanjay Kishan Kaul and KM Joseph held organising protests is good for democracy and people have a fundamental right to dissent against the Citizenship Amendment Act even when the matter is pending in court, they disapproved the practice of blocking roads and public places during stir. “We are not saying that people have no right to protest during the pendency of the case. It is people’s fundamental right to assemble and protest. But the question is where to protest. Tomorrow there may be another law passed and what will happen if people start blocking roads in protest. What will happen if everybody starts blocking the roads. Our concern is what would it lead to if people start blocking the roads. It will create chaos,” the bench said.

It said there are people who are supporting the law and they can also resort to blocking roads and that would further create problem.

“What is troubling us is the blocking of public roads,” it said, emphasising that it was best to find out amicable solution to the problem by convincing protesters to shift their site of protest and clear the road for traffic.

Solicitor general Tushar Mehta, appearing for Delhi Police, said that common people are facing problem due to Shaheen Bagh protests and told the bench that the police tried its best to persuade the protesters but they refused. He said that protesters are using women and children as shield due to which it has not been able to take any action against the protesters who are keeping the city to “hostage” under the garb of protest.

But the bench also pulled up the government for not taking steps to resolve the problem in the last 60 days after Mehta contended that an impression should not go that authorities are kneeling down before the protesters. The court asked the Centre to explore all possibility and grant the protesters an alternate place to hold protests. “You can give a few options to protesters. Let you not close your mind, and try all possibilities,” the bench told the Centre.

The court said it is very important that people are allowed to protest but every right comes with a responsibility and there are lines and boundaries within which people should hold protest in democracy.

Hoping that protesters at Shaheen Bagh will realise and vacate the road, the bench said, “We expressed our opinion what we want to do. We are hopeful that reason will prevail on them. It is not a pleasant task but we have taken up the task to resolve it”.

The apex court was hearing an appeal filed by advocate Amit Sahni and BJP leader Nand Kishore Garg seeking its directions to the Delhi Police to remove the protesters from Shaheen Bagh to ensure smooth traffic flow on the Kalindi Kunj-Shaheen Bagh stretch, which has been blocked by anti-CAA protesters since December 15.

Wajahat Habibullah and Bhim Army chief Chandrashekhar Azad also moved the SC seeking impleadment in the case and alleged that the Delhi administration had deliberately blocked other roads connecting the capital to Noida and Faridabad to create public inconvenience. They contended that there were other routes which could be used for traffic movement after the main road was blocked due to the protests but the administration had deliberately blocked those roads on the pretext of the ongoing demonstration.

Miramar beach

PANAJI: Miramar beach is likely to lose out on the Blue Flag certification , at least for now, with the Union environment ministry not inviting Goa for the meeting to review Beach Environment Aesthetic Management Systems (BEAMS).

A senior official said the Centre had only invited those states where infrastructure has been completed or is in progress. As the certification team conducts an inspection visit once a year, Goa and Maharashtra will not be among the states that will have Blue Flag certified beaches, the official said.

Those who will participate in the meeting include Daman and Diu, Gujarat, Karnataka, Kerala, Puducherry, Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Odisha and Andaman and Nicobar.

In October last year, the high court of Bombay at Goa has stayed operations of the July 12, 2019, notification for Blue Flag certification of Miramar beach after an activist filed a public interest litigation (PIL) before it.

The PIL had stated that the Union environment ministry issued the notification without a draft notification, public hearing or inviting objections from the public.

The project is already being opposed by some local groups and fishermen stating that work on raising infrastructure at Miramar for the Blue Flag certification should not begin until the draft Coastal Zone Management Plan for Goa is finalised.

The Union environment ministry had prepared an estimate of about Rs 8 crore for setting up bamboo and wood toilets, a sewage treatment plant, showers, a lifeguard cabin, outdoor gym, water quality monitoring, cleaning of beach stretch, disability access and maintenance for two years. Thereafter, the infrastructure was to be transferred to Goa Tourism Development Corporation , a senior official said.

The Blue Flag certification from the Foundation for Education, Denmark, is a voluntary certification where countries have to meet 33 criteria for chosen beaches. It is one of the most stringent certification related to sustainable ecotourism development of beaches encompassing high quality standards of water quality, safety of beach goers, public amenities, sound waste management plans, focus on renewable energy and water conservation, environment education, information on biodiversity and beach ecology.

The government of India has launched an ambitious program to get 100 beaches certified by 2024 with central funds.

The officer said that in addition to Miramar, five other beaches were selected for the certification — Agonda, Palolem, Benaulim, Baina and Morjim. However, there has been no response from the state administration to constitute beach management committees.

AURANGABAD: The local crime branch of Aurangabad rural police busted an interstate gang of vehicle thieves and arrested six people, including a sub-contractor working with Samruddhi Mahamarg, the super expressway connecting Mumbai – Nagpur.

Police have seized three vehicles, including a heavy vehicle. Teams have been sent to recover other vehicles that were stolen and sold off in different parts of the country.

The arrested suspects have been identified as Shivaji Lahire (32) of Vaijapur tehsil of Aurangabad, his brother in-law Mahesh alias Kahar Birute (35) of Amardham in Nashik. The police have also arrested Surat residents Abdul Kalam Chaudhary (40), Diwankar alias Chotu Chavan (22), Shubhneskumar Bhatiya (26) and Mohammed Istikhan (30).

Addressing a news conference, Aurangabad rural superintendent of police Mokshada Patil said, “The suspects have offences registered against them in Maharashtra, Gujarat, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh. Preliminary probe has revealed that this gang may have committed vehicle thefts from Ahmednagar, Pune, Nashik and several other parts of the state.

“The arrested suspects have confessed to their involvement in vehicle thefts and teams are cross-verifying their confessions. Out of the three seized vehicles, one car with registration in Gujarat and a heavy vehicle has Punjab passing have been recovered,” said Patil.

Inspector Bhagwat Phunde said that Abdul Kalam has several cases of vehicle theft registered against him in different states. He is a friend of Birute. They took the help of Lahire to identify heavy vehicles that were being used for carrying of sand and construction material.

On identification of the target vehicle, Chavan and Bhatiya would turn up and steal the vehicle. To avoid getting caught in the CCTV cameras installed at the toll plazas on the highway, the duo would take Lahire’s help and drive through internal roads of rural Nashik.

At Nashik, Istikhan would disable the GPS installed, if any, on the vehicles, before handing over the stolen vehicles to Abdul Kalam.

LCB’s assistant inspector Bhagatsingh Dulat said each member of the gang had a specific role and precaution was taken that others do not know the role of the others in the gang.

“The suspects used a toolkit and used it to change the chassis as well as engine number of the stolen vehicle. These numbers are matched with the documents of an existing original vehicle, making it difficult even for the government agencies to catch the theft,” said Dulat.

MEERUT: After being harassed and asked to wear ‘ burqa ’ to save themselves from regular teasing, scores of college girls from the minority community on Monday approached sub divisional magistrate (SDM) in Bulandshahr’s Khurja and sought action. Acting swiftly on the complaint, SDM Isha Priya, accompanied by station house officer (SHO) of the area, reached the locality where the girls were being harassed, and held a meeting with the residents.

The officials warned the people of the area that those harassing the college girls will be booked and arrested.

SDM Priya said, “Some miscreants in Sarai Murtaza colony were harassing the girls and asking them to wear burqa. The girls told us that when their families had no problem in sending them college, then how can these men raise questions?”

The SDM held a meeting with the locals and encouraged them to continue sending their daughters to college. “We could have filed a case and arrested the accused. But, as of now, we are just issuing warning,” she said.

The locals and religious heads of the community assured the SDM and the police that the incident of harassment will not be repeated.

MEERUT: Residents of Kailavan village in Bulandshahar district kept the body of a former village head, Sanjay Sharma (45), on the state highway on Monday to press for immediate arrest of the culprits. Sharma, also a local Samajwadi Party leader, was shot at multiple times by rivals in the village on Sunday.

Seven people, including former block pramukh, Mukesh Sharma who is the main accused, have been named in the FIR for murder. But police are yet to make any arrests.

The sit-in with protesters raising slogans continued for three to four hours, forcing senior police officers to rush to the spot. The protest was called off only after the senior officers persuaded the villagers to lift the blockade and assured the agitating family of strict action in the case.

The deceased’s family has expressed anger over the delay in arresting the accused and is also concerned about its security.

Trying to allay their fears, Harendra Kumar , Bulandshahr superintendent of police (rural areas) said, “We have assured them of that the accused will be arrested at the earliest and the family will be provided security. Raids are being conducted to nab the accused.”

According to sources, the murder is a fallout of an ongoing political rivalry in the village. According to police, Sanjay Sharma and an acquaintance were returning from the field on a motorcycle on Sunday evening when they were confronted by the rival group at a wedding function. An argument took place between then and took an ugly turn when the assailants opened fire at him and his aide. Sanjay Sharma later succumbed to bullet injuries at a local hospital.

HARVEER: Police have claimed to have made a breakthrough in a case relating to the death of a woman and her two children in Amroha district and registered an FIR against four people, including her husband and in-laws for murder. No one has been arrested so far. A probe is on.

According to officials, on February 13, a 26-year-old woman, Saaema, was found hanging while her two children, a two-and-a-half year-old daughter and a 17 month-old son, were found dead under mysterious circumstances in their house at Sentali village under Didoli police station in Amroha.

Initially, the deceased’s husband, Mohammad Aasif, had claimed that his wife had committed suicide after killing her two children. But the post-mortem report of the woman said she was strangled.

Based on a written complaint by Saaema’s brother, an FIR under relevant sections has been registered against Aasif, his brother, Aakib, sister, Salma, and sister’s husband, Rizwan.

Talking with TOI, Amroha superintendent of police Vipin Tada said, “Police are probing the matter thoroughly. A police team on Saturday had gone to Aasif’s house but at that time, a family member had taken ill and police had to come back. The post-mortem report of the woman had revealed that she did not commit suicide but she may have been strangled to death. Her brother has alleged that Aasif and his family members tortured her for dowry and they murdered her and her two children.”

Tada claimed, “Police is on the right track and will crack the case soon.”

Nashik: The smart city development corporation has again missed the deadline to make two traffic signals on the smart road fully operational.

The Nashik Municipal Smart City Development Corporation Ltd (NMSCDCL) was to make the two signals — at Meher and CBS junctions — functional by February 15. However, the trials are still on and the signals are yet to be connected with the command and control room in the Panchavati divisional office, officials said.

“Currently, we are doing data analysis and testing proof of concepts of the traffic signals. This is a new concept and we are studying it. We will make both the traffic signals on smart city road operational with monitoring from the command and control centre once our trials are over,” said Prakash Thavil, the CEO of NMSCDCL.

The traffic signals will have advanced CCTV cameras to identify traffic violations and capture the registration numbers of vehicles. It will identify red signal violations too.

Around 800 cameras are to be installed under the smart city mission. Of which, some CCTV cameras with advanced security features are to be installed on all 50 traffic signals across the city. The pilot project of traffic signals with CCTV cameras is being implemented on smart road stretch of 1.1 km from Ashok Stambh and Trimbak Naka.

NMSCDCL had allowed vehicles to ply on the smart road from January 26 even though some works were yet to be completed such as installing high masts, e-toilets and other facilities along the stretch.

The project of CCTV cameras, Wi-Fi and other ICT (Information Communication Technology) is being implemented by the Maharashtra Information Technology Corporation (MahaIT) at a total cost of Rs 169 crore. Of which, the contribution of the NMSCDCL is Rs 45.43 crore. 800 CCTV cameras are to be installed by the MahaIT at major locations across the city. A command and control room is also being set up.

MEERUT: Nearly two weeks after a newborn baby went missing from Lala Lajpat Rai Memorial (LLRM) Medical College, Meerut police have rescued the baby from Lisari Gate area on Monday even as the woman who kidnapped the baby is still on the run.

Inquiry revealed that the accused Suraiya hatched a plan to kidnap the baby as she couldn’t conceive even in her third marriage. Police later rescued the baby and handed him over to the family.

Meerut SP (city) Akhilesh Narayan Singh said, “The accused married Aasif a few years ago. The couple used to fight often as she was unable to conceive a child. While Aasif was away for work, she started roaming with a fake pregnancy bump to misguide the locals and her husband. Meanwhile, she was also looking for a newborn in LLRM Medical College .”

According to police, the plan of stealing the baby came up in the mind of the accused a few days ago when she had gone to stay at her sister’s house in Ajrara village of Meerut district . Police said that there she saw a neighbour, Sumaiya, who was eight months pregnant at the time. “She waited for the delivery of Sumaiya and then stole the baby. While we have rescued the baby safely, the accused is still on the run. Police teams have been formed to arrest her at the earliest,” said Singh.

The newborn boy was stolen allegedly by a woman in her forties from LLRM Medical College on February 3. His family mistook the woman to be hospital staff when she started helping them. Later, she stole the baby by sending away his father to dispose a diaper. As soon as the man went near the dustbin, the woman fled with the baby. He tried to chase her but she melted into the crowd.

PANAJI: Nearly a week after the tourism industry took a severe beating, and following criticism from various sections of the society, the state government on Monday withdrew its notification imposing Section 144 of the CrPC for a 60-day period.The notification dated February 10, 2020, had created panic and fear among locals as well as tourists , who even cancelled their travel plans to Goa.TOI was the first to report the implications the notification had on the tourism industry, which had led to cancellation of holiday bookings, including that for the Carnival week.Slamming the government, tourism stakeholders had said that the notification inflicted a severe blow to the already limping industry and that the government needed to reassure tourists that holidaying in Goa was safe as usual.“The order issued under Section 144 of CrPC stands withdrawn with immediate effect,” North Goa district magistrate Gopal Parsekar said. Additional collector, South Goa, Surendra Naik also issued a similar order.Invoking Section 144 of CrPC, the district authorities had highlighted that Goa was facing a possible terror threat and that restrictions had to be imposed for proper tenant verification and identification in cyber cafes.Following an outcry from tourism stakeholders, chief minister Pramod Sawant on Saturday tried to play down the notification by stating that there was no terror alert for the state and that it had been merely issued as a routine affair. He also said that tourists should not worry about visiting the state, including for the weeklong Carnival festivities, which begin on February 22.“We are thinking of withdrawing the notification. There is unnecessary panic due to media highlighting the notification. There is no terror alert for the state and people should not panic. I welcome tourists to visit Goa,” Sawant had said.District magistrate North Goa R Menaka, who is currently on leave, also came out with a detailed clarification to her February 10 notification on Saturday. She said that though Section 144 has been imposed, it would not prevent assembly of four or more persons.The order is a precautionary measure only to step up alertness, essentially to impose tenant verification on all the owners of residential accommodations, private guesthouses, paying guest accommodations, etc, so that there is proper verification of antecedents before premises are let out on lease, rent or hire basis, the North Goa collector had said.Menaka also tried to underplay the effect on tourism due to her order.“The order doesn’t impact tourists, Carnival, Shigmo or other celebrations. The public should not panic as these orders have been routinely issued as part of general preparedness in the past too for the entire state by both the district magistrates,” Menaka had said.",goa,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74183271,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-180424,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/with-tourists-cancelling-goa-plans-state-withdraws-sec-144/articleshow/74182831.cms

Aurangabad: The MIDC Waluj police have booked nine people on the charges of rioting and unlawful assembly after they brutally assaulted three men for not honouring the birthday party invitation that was extended to them.

The police have already arrested two of the nine suspects and were produced before the court on Monday, following which they have been remanded to two days police custody. The two suspects have been identified as Jafar Shaikh and Yusuf Shaikh.

As per the complaint lodged by 31-year old Shaikh Nazim, who runs a paan stall in Sajapur area of Waluj, the suspects reached out to him on Saturday night and asked him the reason for not attending his nephew’s birthday party. Not convinced with the reply, the suspect got into a heated argument with Nazim. The altercation soon took a violent turn, with members of the suspect’s family allegedly carrying sticks joining him.

The incident left Nazim with head injuries including stitches on his head, the two others who rushed to his rescue escaped with minor injuries.

Police sub-inspector Prashant Gambhirrao said that the two of the accused have been arrested, while the others have reportedly gone underground. “Though the complaint specifically mentions that the man was assaulted for not honouring the birthday invitation given by the suspect, but we are not completely convinced with the reason,” said Gambhirrao.

He informed that statements of eyewitnesses have been recorded and they are further checking the background and relations of the victims and the suspects. The suspects have been slapped with charges of voluntarily causing hurt by dangerous weapons, unlawful assembly, rioting, voluntarily causing hurt, an intentional insult for causing a breach of peace and for criminal intimidation.

DEHRADUN: Dehradun Municipal Corporation ( DMC ) is going to install more than 1 lakh LED streetlights across all 100 wards of the city by the end of this year, officials claimed on Monday. The 68 old wards will get 43,000 new LED streetlights while the 32 new wards will be lit up with 65,000 LED streetlights.

The officials added that DMC has almost achieved its target of installing 43,000 LED streetlights in the old wards but works are yet to start in the 32 new wards. At present, the streetlights in the new wards have sodium bulb which are to be replaced with the LED ones. Also in most of the new wards, there is a need to erect poles as well. According DMC estimates, the LED streetlights are likely to increase the electricity bill by around 40% but they will have a better lifespan as compared to the sodium ones.

Meanwhile, DMC officials also conducted a raid in the Niranjanpur market on Monday for polythene bags. As many as 200 polythene bags were confiscated. DMC officials claimed they have issued a total fine of Rs 1 lakh (Rs 500 per polythene) during the raids. The fines were issued for violating Uttarakhand’s anti-spitting and anti-littering legislation enacted in 2016.

NEW DELHI: Delhi Sikh Gurdwara Management Committee (DSGMC) president Manjinder Singh Sirsa on Monday demanded immediate citizenship for around 160 Pakistani Hindu Sikh refugee families who have been living in unhygienic conditions in jhuggis and semi-permanent structures on the Yamuna floodplain near Majnu Ka Tila in north Delhi.

Addressing a press conference, Sirsa said around 60 of these families had reached Delhi from Pakistan between February 2 and 15, while 10 families had come just a day ago.

“Around 160 refugee families living in Delhi should be granted Indian citizenship on priority. A majority of the migrant refugees are professionally qualified and willing to contribute to the growth and economy of the country. Many of them are anxious to start working in their respective professions to resume their daily life activities,” Sirsa said, adding that he had requested Union home minister Amit Shah to expedite the citizenship request that was pending with the Centre.

Sirsa added that Shah had a positive reaction to his demands. “He has already instructed the Union home secretary to find out viable legal alternatives to ensure dignified living conditions for these families,” Sirsa said.

Nashik: The civic administration has slapped notices on 87 housing societies and apartments and recovered fine to the tune of Rs 83 ,000 from them since January this year as the rainwater havesting systems installed on their premises were found to be defunct.

As per norms, it is mandatory for residential buildings, societies and apartments constructed on at least 500 sqm of land to have rainwater harvesting systems. While some residential societies and apartments have not put in place the infrastructure, there are others that have installed the rainwater harvesting systems, but they are lying defunct.

The public works department of the Nashik Municipal Corporation (NMC) has started a survey based on the directions issued by municipal commissioner Radhakrishna Game.

“We have started conducting a survey of housing societies and apartments to ensure they have installed rainwater harvesting systems. Only installing the system is not enough, it should be functional as well,” said officials.

“So far, we have surveyed 583 residential buildings in the city since January 1. During the survey, we found rainwater harvesting system operational in 335 residential buildings, while the facility was lying defunct in 248 buildings,” said civic officials.

“Of the 248 residential buildings where the rainwater harvesting system is lying defunct, we have issued notices and slapped fines of around Rs 1,000 each on 87 buildings. Notices will soon be slapped on 161 residential buildings for not operating their rainwater harvesting system,” said sources in the NMC.

Apart from this, NMC has also started making provisions for rainwater harvesting at its own buildings and properties. The civic administration has over 1,000 properties of which it has possession over 145, while the remaining ones have been leased out to various social outfits. The NMC has decided to install rainwater harvesting system in all its properties.

The civic administration has zeroed in on 110 plots, including its own buildings and properties, where they will install the rainwater harvesting system in the next couple of months.

“It was Rs 4,24,000 crore last fiscal, STPI export alone, in year 2018-19,” he told newspersons on the sidelines of an event here.

“It will grow in two digits, 10% per cent, over and above. There are indications. Because, our figures are compiled in the month of coming September. I am talking about STPI.

213,['18/02/2020'],Priyanka Gandhi Vadra for Rajya Sabha: Clamour in Madhya Pradesh Congress,"This story is from February 18, 2020

Priyanka Gandhi Vadra

BHOPAL: There is rising clamour in Madhya Pradesh Congress for nominating AICC general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra to Rajya Sabha from the state.

Three RS seats are falling vacant in MP in April, and two of these would be represented by Congress. One seat will go to BJP. The incumbents are senior Congress leader Digvijaya Singh and BJP veterans Prabhat Jha and Satyanarayan Jatiya. Their tenure ends on April 9.

Minister Sajjan Singh Verma, an SC leader known to be close to chief minister Kamal Nath, was the first to suggest that Priyanka be nominated. “Madhya Pradesh is a state with predominant SC and ST population. Former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi had a soft corner for under-privileged communities. Forty years ago, Indira Gandhi brought Kamal Nath to Madhya Pradesh and he was elected MP. Today, the political scenario is such that time has come for Priyanka Gandhi to be sent from the state for a new political start,” he argued.

This triggered a chorus of support. Former Union minister Arun Yadav tweeted, “Time has come that honourable Rahul Gandhiji is again given charge of the party. It will be favourable if Priyanka Gandhiji is given the opportunity to represent Madhya Pradesh in Rajya Sabha so that grassroots struggle against fascist ideology can be intensified.”

Urban administration minister Jaivardhan Singh — Digvijaya’s son — also welcomed the idea. “It would be a matter of delight if Priyanka Gandhi comes forward. If her name is declared, everyone will welcome it. Not just for Congress, Priyanka Gandhi’s leadership is necessary for the entire country. She has been very active in Uttar Pradesh politics and Congress has benefited just not in that state but throughout the country,” he said.

Agency reports quoted PR minister P C Sharma as saying that people see Indira Gandhi's image in Priyanka. “Priyanka Gandhiji should be sent to Rajya Sabha from Madhya Pradesh, or any other state in that case. This will strengthen the party,” he told reporters. He told TOI that AICC president Sonia Gandhi will decide on Priyanka’s nomination to Rajya Sabha.

If Priyanka were to be nominated from Madhya Pradesh, Congress will have a tough choice to make for the second seat. It could be a toss-up between Digvijaya and former Guna MP Jyotiraditya Scindia.

Goa CM Pramod Pandurang Sawant

PANAJI: In over 50% of the cases, the state government has accepted recommendations and guidelines issued by the Goa Lokayukta. Of the 13 cases disposed, in eight the government accepted recommendations, while in five it is yet to take action. The Lokayukta had also submitted recommendations in four other cases, but no compliance was sought when the cases were disposed.

The state government has to submit a compliance report within three months to the Lokayukta.

In the multi-crore beach cleaning scam case, Goa Lokayukta had found then tourism minister Dilip Parulekar guilty of “favouritism”, besides other irregularities, and had recommended that the anti-corruption branch (ACB) of the vigilance department reopen investigation. It also said that the government should consider referring the matter to CBI.

In his recommendation sent to the government, then chairperson, former Patna high court chief justice P K Misra, had said that ACB should reopen the investigation, particularly keeping in view the possibility of conspiracy and any kickbacks.

As per RTI information, in the Parulekar case, public information officer Laxman Zalmi said that the Lokayukta did not seek any compliance report from the government.

Regarding the renewal of 88 mining leases between November 2014 and January 2015, the Lokayukta recommended that ACB file an FIR against former chief minister Laxmikant Parsekar, former mines secretary Pawan Kumar Sain and former mines director Prasanna Acharya in connection with the alleged “corruption” and “criminal conspiracy”. Misra also said that Sain and Acharya shouldn’t hold offices.

In the mining case, Zalmi said that the action taken report is awaited.

In one case, as the government did not submit the compliance report, Zalmi said it has been deemed accepted, and the sarpanch deemed to have vacated his office with effect from December 16, 2019. The Lokayukta said that on the basis of finding that the complaint has been substantiated against the sarpanch, the public functionary should not continue to hold office of sarpanch and or ward member of the panchayat.

BHOPAL: A Dalit was shot dead, allegedly by a forest ranger, in MP’s Shivpuri during an altercation between his family and foresters over filling of water from a hand pump on Sunday. A case has been registered against 14 forest department personnel, including a woman, under IPC and SC/ST Prevention of Atrocities Act.

The victim, 35-year-old Madan Balmiki, lived in Fatehpur village, about 55km from Shivpuri town. His family alleges that forest personnel humiliated them when they were drawing water from a tubewell near the Fatehpur outpost. It triggered an altercation during which Madan was shot dead.

The forest department, on the other hand, claims stones were thrown at them during an anti-encroachment drive and Madan was shot when some villagers were trying to snatch a gun. TI of Karera police station Rakesh Sharma said they are trying to arrest the 14 accused forest employees, who fled after the incident.

Sources say Madan’s wife and cousin were washing utensils at the hand pump near Fatehpur forest checkpost when ranger Suresh Sharma came to fill his waterbottle and a few drops of water spilled on him. He got angry and hurled casteist remarks at them, says the FIR. Madan’s wife alleges in her complaint: “My daughter ran over and told him not to abuse us. But a woman forester dragged her by the hair and slapped her. When my husband came running to intervene, he was shot dead.”

The Forest department tried to defend its personnel, claiming that Madan was shot dead as villagers tried to snatch the gun of a forest guard who was part of the anti-encroachment squad.

Shivpuri SP Rajesh Singh Chandel told TOI that there was no “caste issue” in this incident, as Madan and two of those booked in the case belong to the same community. “Madan’s father is also a forest guard. Forest employees claim they had to fire after villagers started pelting stones at them, but the family members of the deceased claim otherwise,” Chandel said.

Villagers staged a protest outside Karera police station, following which a murder case under IPC 302 was registered against seven people, including ranger Suresh Sharma. Opposition BJP and BSP targeted the government, alleging that atrocities against Dalits have risen in the past year. BSP says it will submit a memorandum to the district collector for action against the forest officials.

The MP forest department started issuing firearms to its staff in 1985. Following controversy, the forest department restricted distribution of revolvers only to rangers posted in sensitive zones, but other forest staff can be armed with .315 rifles, 12-bore guns and pump-action shotguns. Forest officials maintain they have powers of protection under Section 197 CrPC, like any government officer, while discharging their duty. They point to at a home department circular (June 11, 1996) which orders police not to initiate criminal proceedings against forest employees or officials named in FIRs, unless use of firearms is proven “unnecessary and unwarranted” in a magisterial inquiry. On Monday, the Shivpuri SP said this circular doesn’t apply in this case as there was no forest near where scene of firing.

Dr Prashant Upadhyay

Vadodara: The sessions court on Monday denied anticipatory bail to priest of Shri Baglamukhi Brahmastra Vidya Mandir in Warasia in connection with a cheating case.

Priest Dr Prashant Upadhyay, who has been accused of cheating a businessman of Rs 21.8 lakh, had moved bail application pleading innocence. Upadhyay claimed the complainant Devraj Pandya had filed a false case against him as he is a naturopath practitioner in Warasia and offers service to the temple. Upadhyay’s lawyer also questioned the timing of the complaint as the offence had taken place between 2013 and 2015. Additional public prosecutor told court that Upadhyay won’t cooperate in investigation if granted bail.

Investigating officer also submitted an affidavit in the court mentioning that prima facie evidence found against the priest which indicate that he had taken money from other people too.

Upadhyay had promised solutions to Pandya to recover from business losses and debts for which he took cash and gold worth Rs 21.8 lakh. Pandya was asked to keep a ‘yantra’ in his factory to recover from losses, but when nothing improved Pandya asked for refund of his money which the priest denied and threatened him.

AURANGABAD: A woman with physical disability was allegedly assaulted by a woman assistant inspector after the former took her deceased husband ’s body to Paithan police station , demanding immediate arrest of the person who was driving the vehicle that killed him.

The woman and her 10 relatives have also been booked by police for unlawful assembly, rioting and using criminal force to deter a government employee from performing his duty.

Assistant inspector Archana Patil, accused of assaulting the woman, justified the action. “After autopsy, instead of taking the body for last rites the woman brought it to the police station. She allegedly demanded that we should get Rs 10 lakh in compensation from the suspect and give it to her,” she said.

“The body was kept at the police station from 7pm to 1am and despite repeated requests the woman did not listen to us. At around 1 am, one of her relatives caught the collar of my constable and manhandled him following which we were compelled to use force for dispersing unruly mob,” she added.

The deceased, Arjun Rathod, was a resident of Kapusvadi village and was hit by speeding SUV on February 11 that led to his death. Following this, Rathod’s wife Devki and kin went to the police station demanding the arrest of the suspect.

The alleged use of force by the police was carried out in the wee hours of February 12, and later the family was forced to accept the body and perform the last rites. The woman went to the office of superintendent of police on Monday morning to complaint about the police inaction and injustice.

“After hours of deadlock, police the woman officer heading the police station assaulted me and my relatives. They kicked us and used batons to disperse us. This was followed by booking us under false charges.”

She said her cousin who accompanied her to the police station has also been booked. “He is preparing for competitive exams. Now, all of my relatives have turned against me and blaming me for ruining his career,” she said, adding the police are reluctant in arresting the suspect.

Meanwhile, Aurangabad rural superintendent of police Mokshada Patil said a senior officer has been asked to cross verify the version from both the sides.

“I have sought CCTV footage of the police station for personally cross verifying the allegations following which appropriate action would be taken against those guilty,” she said.

Sources informed that the SP has expressed unhappiness over the manner in which the issue was handled by the local police and has issued specific directives asking them to be more sensitive while handling such cases.

Amritsar: When Pakistan’s Jagjit Kaur got married to Mohammad Hassan and changed her name to Ayesha Bibi, she almost created a religious rift with her family opposing it vehemently and local Muslims storming Gurdwara Nankana Sahib. Now, sources said Jagjit’s family is reportedly exploring possibilities of seeking asylum in India as they feel unsafe there.

According to sources, Manmohan Singh, Jagjit’s brother has approached his contacts in India to discuss a way out. “Let people say the relations between Sikhs and Muslims in Nankana Sahib are cordial. But the attack on Gurdwara Nankana Sahib by Hassan’s brothers, with the help of other Muslims, had laid bare all such tall claims. The family feels unsafe living there and wants to shift to India before it it too late,” said sources.

Jagjit and Hassan’s lawyer, Mohammad Sultan Sheikh, said on Thursday that he had heard the that Jagjit’s family was willing to take asylum in India. “But I am not sure how authentic this news is,” he added.

However, Amarjeet Singh, Jagjit’s uncle who lives in Nankana Sahib, denied that Jagjit’s family is planning to go to India. He said Hassan’s elder brother Imran, who had stormed the gurdwara, is behind bars, now so the family does not have any immediate threat.

Meanwhile, Sheikh said the forensic report of Hassan’s mobile phone was presented in the court on Thursday. The report said there was no evidence of Hassan sending obscene photographs or objectionable messages to Kaur’s family members. “The report has been submitted and the case had been adjured till Monday,” said the lawyer.

Nankana Sahib police had lodged a FIR against Jagjit’s husband Hassan on the complaint of Kaur’s brother Manmohan Singh, who had alleged that Hassan had been harassing them by sending objectionable messages.

NAINITAL: Uttarakhand high court ( HC ) on Monday disposed of a Public Interest Litigation (PIL) that has challenged the legality of the ordinance brought by the Uttarakhand government giving sops to former chief ministers of the state.

The HC order came after it was informed that the ordinance has now been turned into an Act as the Uttarakhand assembly ratified it during the winter session in December. “We informed the court that the ordinance brought by the government has become an Act as it has been ratified by the state assembly in December. Since the ordinance no longer exists, the HC dismissed the current petition challenging the provisions and legality of the ordinance,” said Kartikey Hari Gupta, the counsel appearing for Dehradun-based NGO, Rural Litigation and Entitlement Kendra (RLEK). The NGO has challenged the ordinance in the HC.

The bench of Chief Justice Ramesh Ranganathan and Justice Alok Kumar Verma has been hearing the PIL against the state’s ordinance. Gupta, meanwhile, added that they have already challenged the Act before the high court as well and the court has already issued notices to former CMs. “The court had ordered the state government to deliver notices to the former CMs as the earlier notices had come back as undelivered,” Gupta said, adding that the case will be heard next on February 25.

Representative image

PANAJI: A two-minute video clip, which was widely circulated through a messaging app, showed a minor boy from Bicholim claiming that he has got free drugs from his friends and subsequently got into a drug-fuelled feud which left him bleeding from the head.

In the clip, the boy states that he consumed ganja (cannabis) which was given to him for free by two other youth which some citizens say once again highlights the prevalence of drugs even in the remote areas of the state.

However, Goa police denied the role of drugs and said that the school student had consumed alcohol and met with an accident at Karaswada while going home.

The incident, which took place on Saturday, was shared via a mobile-app on Monday. Police said that the boy was on his way home after school and consumed two beers and while heading home on a bike he met with an accident at Karaswada and suffered mild injuries.

The boy was found by locals who quizzed him and handed him over to a patrol team that was passing by, police said. Police personnel took him to Mapusa police station and then shifted him to North Goa district hospital for treatment since he was bleeding. It is not known whether the boy had a fall or was beaten up by some vigilante group of boys.

Even as his injuries were being treated, the minor’s uncle came and took him home.

The incident gave Congress an opportunity to criticise the government. State Congress president Girish Chodankar said that the boy’s statements prove that drugs are widely available in the villages and in the hinterland.

“Children’s future is being destroyed because of drugs. If the chief minister does not take this seriously then we will protest outside his residence,” Chodankar said.

Migratory birds coming to the state will now be tagged with information regarding their origin and route taken... Read More

PATNA: Migratory birds coming to the state will now be tagged with information regarding their origin and route taken by them. The forest department will set up “ringing” stations at various bird habitats before the next winter.

Bihar will be the fourth state in the country after Tamil Nadu, Rajasthan and Orissa to initiate this process in which rings containing a satellite-enabled chip will be fitted in one of the legs of the migratory species.

Senior officials in state environment, forests and climate change department said bird ringing stations will be set up at migratory bird habitats and the rings will help in providing information of their origin, route taken as well as their weight and gender.

A memorandum of understanding (MoU) to implement the process was signed between the state forest department and the Bombay Natural History Society (BNHS) at the 13th Conference of Parties (COP) of the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory at Gandhinagar in Gujarat on Monday.

The MoU is for five years under which the state government will spend Rs5 crore on the project. The forest department principal secretary, Dipak Kumar Singh, said, “Mobile ringing stations will be set up at places like Nagi-Natki in Jamui, Kusheshwarsthan in Darbhanga, Baraila Jheel in Vaishali and Kanwar lake in Begusarai, places where migratory birds come during winter.”

The main ringing centre will be set up in Bhagalpur as the diara region attracts many migratory birds. It is also one of the three known breeding places of the Greater Adjutant in the world, apart from Assam and Cambodia.

“At the main ringing station, scientists will study the information gathered from mobile stations. Study of information gathered from the rings will help in knowing migration pattern of the birds, and if their number has decreased and reasons for the same,” Singh said.

He added, “Initially for five years, scientist from BNHA will be assisting our team and later we will do all the work on our own. Local communities and bird lovers will also be involved in such activities to take them closer to nature.”

Emphasising on the need to have such ringing stations, Dipak said, out of the 13 flyways used by migratory species across the globe, two —Central Asian Flyways and East Asian Flyways — pass through Bihar. A flyway is a geographical area within which migratory species complete their annual cycle.

Sources said that the dog started biting people in the morning and it is believed that it attacked around 20 persons. The reason for such behaviour of the canine is believed to be rabies, but this has not been confirmed yet.

The incidents of dog bites were recorded on CCTV cameras located in the busy street. The dog, however, became evasive when attempts were made to capture it. The local administration also did not have expert teams to handle the canine.

231,['18/02/2020'],Women in rural Odisha earn nearly 3 times less than men: Eco survey,"This story is from February 18, 2020

Bhubaneswar: There’s a yawning gap between the average wages of men and women in Odisha with rural women earning on an average Rs 7,477 less than their male counterparts, while for urban women the pay gap is less at Rs 6,763, according to the Economic Survey Report 2018-19 released here on Monday.

There’s a nearly three-fold gap between the average earnings of a male and a female salaried employee in rural Odisha, with the man earning Rs 11, 503 as against a woman’s average salary of R 4,026. Similarly in urban areas, a male employee gets an average salary of Rs 19,623 while the average salary of a female employee is Rs 12,860 with a gender pay gap of Rs 6,763.

For casual workers, too, there is wage disparity between male and female workers. However, the wage gap is higher in urban areas as compared to rural areas, the report said. The situation is equally bad in the unorganized sector, especially in agriculture and other labour-intensive sectors where women continue to get paid significantly less than men. The average per day wage of a causal labourer (other than public works) for men is Rs 244.71 per day against Rs 160.77 per day for women in rural areas.

Similarly, in urban areas the average per day wage for men is Rs 265.94 against Rs 178.48 per day for women. The gender pay gap in unorganised sector in urban and rural areas is Rs 87.46 and Rs 83.94 per day in the state. “The disparity begins from childhood when not many girls are allowed to go to school. Very few of them continue higher education and lesser number get skill training. Women are not considered as a skilled workforce. If they join the workforce they have to take leave for maternity, childcare and health of family members. Unlike men they have to work both at home and at workplace affecting their performance,” said women’s rights activist Prajna Bastia.

The high gender pay gap is also affected by lower labour force participation rate (LFPR) of women in the state. The LFPR for men and women in Odisha is 84.1 and 21.6 respectively against the national average of 80.2 and 25.3. Financial independence being one of the key strands for gender equality and women’s empowerment, there is a considerable gap in access to finance for women. Of the total bank deposits, 60.3% bank accounts are owned by men compared to 28.9% by women and remaining by non-individuals. Amounts deposited by men are more than double that of women, the report pointed out.

Activist Namrata Chadha said, “Neither women’s rights activists nor policy makers have ever focused on economic empowerment of women.” She added, “Women’s issues are confined to either domestic violence or formation of self-help groups. The issue equal work for equal pay for men and women has never been raised in a proper forum, so the gender pay gap is widening.”

Trichy: Indiscriminate dumping of waste near an anganwadi centre on Pakkali street in Bhima Nagar has become a health hazard for the students and teachers. Citing heaps of garbage including animal waste and dead rodents at the entrance of the anganwadi, parents are hesitating to send their children here.

There were 100 students in the centre last year, but the strength has now come down to 60. Teachers attribute the decline to the garbage mound. According to residents, since waste collection by the corporation is irregular in Bhima Nagar and adjoining localities, waste is dumped outside the anganwadi centre. While bins in all parts of the city were removed, a tank-like garbage bin constructed with brick and mortar near the anganwadi is among the last few standing bins in the city, thus attracting tonnes of waste each day.

“Since corporation’s vehicles arrive to collect waste only once in 10 days, people dump garbage in the bin near the anganwadi. Preying on the food and animal waste, a pack of stray dogs often loiter near the anganwadi,” said K Janardhanan, a resident of Bhima Nagar.

Teachers at the anganwadi claimed that the garbage attracts rodents, flies and mosquitoes. Waste including from beef and chicken stalls in Alwarthope also heads here.

When contacted, corporation officials said that waste collection was regular in Bhima Nagar. “A proposal is on the cards to redevelop the road in Pakkali street. While relaying the road, the bin where waste is dumped will be demolished,” the source said.

Trichy: Residents of Keelakalkandar Kottai have raised objection to the Trichy Corporation’s proposal to construct a sewage treatment plant (STP) in the area as they fear that it would affect the quality of groundwater and agriculture. However, the corporation has said that it will implement the project as the Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board (TNPCB) has given the green signal.

The STP at Keelakalkandar Kottai was proposed as part of the package III of Phase II of the underground drainage (UGD) project under AMRUT scheme funded by the Asian Development Bank (ADB). As per plan, the STP would treat wastewater from five wards which would be collected through a proposed underground drainage system. The wastewater will be retreated using the modern sequential batch reactor (SBR) technology and let into the Uyyakondan canal.

“Keelakalkandar Kottai is a fertile agrarian area. Proposing an STP here is a bad choice. We are not against the STP, it can be relocated to a barren site,” J Mathivanan, a resident said.

The corporation said that land at Keelakalkandar Kottai was availed from the revenue department and the civic body has constructed an alternative threshing platform for the farmers as the existing one will be utilized for the STP. Undeterred by the opposition, corporation rallying with clearances from the district administration and TNPCB said the civil work will commence soon. “We are following the proper code of practice to construct the STP. The wastewater will be processed and treated at the STP as per safety standards and there is no chance for ground or water contamination,” an official said. The civic body added that the proposed site will not be relocated.

Bhubaneswar: Amid nationwide concern over the safety of women, Odisha registered 17.9% rise in rape cases in 2019 compared to 2018, according to a written reply by minister of state for home Dibya Shankar Mishra in the assembly here on Monday.

Mishra, while replying to a question from BJD’s Satyabadi MLA Umakant Samantray, said 2,950 rape cases were registered in 2019.

Police registered 2,502 rape cases in 2018, Mishra’s reply stated.

Police sources said most of the rape offences were unpreventable as the accused were close acquaintances of the survivors. “We found that at least 92% of the rape survivors were known to the accused. The accused included friends, relatives and neighbours of the survivors,” a senior police officer said.

The officer said police promptly took action after receiving the complaints. “We would have been blamed had we suppressed such complaints. Post-Nirbhaya incident, registration of cases relating to crime against women increased across the country. Women, who some years ago were reluctant to report the matters to police, have now shown courage and approached police. We have made prompt arrests and filed chargesheets in time. Efforts are being made to improve the conviction rate,” the officer said.

Data shared by Mishra in the assembly also showed increase in some other forms of crime against women.

Molestation cases increased to 6,848 in 2019 as against 5,875 in 2018. Incidents of stalking of women rose to 351 in 2019 from 281 cases reported in 2018. Trafficking of women increased alarmingly by 129 % in the state last year. While 51 women were trafficked in 2018, the number went up to 117 in 2019. Kidnapping of women also shot up to 4,089 cases in 2019 from 3,424 cases in 2018.

Bhubaneswar witnessed nearly 14% rise in overall registration of criminal cases last year compared to 2018.

While 7,219 criminal cases were registered in Bhubaneswar in 2018, the figure went up to 8,229 in 2019. Bhubaneswar witnessed rise in rapes, dacoities, thefts, stalkings, eve-teasing and abduction of women last year.

Sanitation workers protesting outside VMC office in Khanderao Market

Vadodara: Sanitation workers of the Vadodara Municipal Corporation (VMC) held demonstrations at the Khanderao Market headquarters of the civic body demanding that they should be given regular appointments. The workers stayed put in the compound outside the office till late on Monday night.

A large majority of sanitation workers of the civic body are on temporary employment. These include those on 11-month contracts and those being paid based on the days of work allocated to them.

Sanitation workers have been demanding since several years that they should be given regular employment. The VMC has been dodging the issue and has been making promises to consider their demands without any concrete steps being taken.

The top brass of the VMC officials met the representatives of the workers late in the evening. The civic body sought time of a month to resolve the issue. Not in a mood to take any more promises, the sanitation workers turned down the offer. They said that they had given enough time regarding their demands and wanted the VMC to come up with a circular for employment of workers.

With the talks reaching a stalemate, the representatives declared that they would continue the protest in the night too.

BHOPAL: The Congress-led government in Madhya Pradesh will not carry out the proposed National Population Register (NPR) update exercise, chief minister Kamal Nath said on Monday evening.

“The NPR notification, about which talks were going on, was issued on December 9, 2019. After this, the Centre has decided to implement Citizen (Amendment) Act. It means the NPR notified by the government is not the one under CAA 2019, but as per provisions of CAA- 1955s, 2003s rule 3. Despite this, NPR will not be implemented in the state,” said Nath.

The Nath cabinet has already passed a resolution against CAA.

Earlier in the day, Congress MLA from Bhopal, Arif Masood, had warned of protests if the government decides to undertake NPR update. Soon after this, law minister P C Sharma said there will be no updation of NPR in Madhya Pradesh. “There is no move at present to undertake the proposed NPR update exercise in the state. The government is not going to implement it,” he said.

NPR is scheduled to be carried out along with the house-listing phase of the Census exercise from April 1 to September 30. The Census Commission has said the objective of NPR is to create a comprehensive identity database of every ‘usual resident’ of the country.

Nagapattinam: Three idols were stolen from a temple in Kondal village near Sirkazhi in Nagapattinam district on Sunday night. Police have registered a case.

According to police, the theft of the three idols - Subramaniyar, Valli and Theivanai - from the Kumara Subramaniya Swami Temple in Kondal village, was noticed when temple priest Babu alias Natarajan, 55, arrived at the temple in the morning on Monday to perform puja. He immediately alerted temple trustee Rajarajan, who informed Sirkazhi police.

Sirkazhi DSP Vandhana and inspector Manimaran conducted an enquiry. Forensic experts and a sniffer dog were pressed into service. Though CCTV cameras were installed at the temple, they were defunct, police said.

“Miscreants used duplicate keys to open the front door of the temple. So, it seems like a well-planned theft executed by known people,” police added.

During interrogation, the temple trustee said that they have been maintaining the temple for more than 100 years. However, he was not sure whether the idols stolen by the miscreants were panchaloha or copper or any other metals. His forefathers had told that the idols were made of panchaloha, police said.

Sirkazhi police have registered a case.

The pond was emptied for rejuvenation and beautification

Vadodara: The Sursagar has water again as the day of its inauguration nears. And seeing red over the blue water is the green brigade in the city that has called it a waste of a precious resource.

The pond was emptied for the rejuvenation and beautification work and only a small quantity of water was left in the Sursagar pond to ensure that the aquatic animals in it did not die. As the work neared completion, the Vadodara Municipal Corporation (VMC) started pumping water into the pond.

Pipes and tubes carrying water to the pond were seen on the embankment of the pond till recently. Those worried over the step even recorded the process of water being released into the on their mobile phones.

Environmentalist Rohit Prajapati said that the water from the pond was emptied earlier to facilitate work. “It is now being filled with water again. Why is the VMC doing so secretively? It even did not declare its intentions of filling the pond in such a way,” said Prajapati.

Prajapati said that the pond had been narrowed down for renovation and even raised doubts regarding the functioning of inlets that brought water to the pond during monsoon. “There have been clear violations of the high court directives regarding the conservation of water bodies,” he said.

A top VMC official admitted that water had been pumped into the pond. “The renovation and beautification would have made no sense without water in the pond,” he said. A source added that the pond had not been filled completely.

Chennai: When the parents of two students insisted on meeting school counsellor *Sujatha, she thought it had something to do with their grades. But she soon found herself out of her depth. Both sets of parents were worried as their daughters had boasted to their classmates that they were bisexual .

“It had become a topic of discussion in school, and the gossip finally reached the parents. I spoke to the girls and they said they are equally attracted to both the sexes and were not ashamed to disclose it to their classmates,” says Sujatha. “I referred them to a psychologist as I felt I wasn’t qualified to handle the situation.”

Being gay , lesbian or bisexual wasn’t something that was spoken about openly, especially at school. But, of late, a few schools in Chennai have seen instances where children have disclosed to their classmates that they are homosexual or bisexual, a claim which they are not sure is true or not. And activists and healthcare professionals feel that while such disclosures shouldn’t be dismissed lightly, and need to be dealt with sensitively, sometimes it may be a bid to get attention or a need to be seen as “cool”.

“Some of them may be bisexual but there are those who do it to get attention. When somebody realises he/ she is bisexual, it is not some kind of jolly erotic trip; it takes the person some time to process it in their mind and understand the pros and cons,” says psychiatrist N Rangarajan.

During the course of an individual’s sexual development, there is a stage when many things, including same sex contact, can be sexually attractive. “But that doesn’t mean that the person is homosexual or bisexual. It’s all part and parcel of the development of one’s sexuality,” he says, adding that concerned parents do bring in children who are confused about their sexual orientation. “While some parents are accepting and want to help, others come down heavily on their children and don’t let them express their sexuality. In such cases, the children are usually brought in as their academic performance is dipping and only when we talk to them they disclose the sexual issues that are bothering them.”

Sexologist Dr Narayana Reddy agrees, saying that when children attain puberty, they are likely to experiment. “They may have same sex experiences but it’s not the same as being homosexual or bisexual,” he says.

Male fantasies related to porn could be another reason why young girls claim to be bisexual, says L Ramakrishnan of SAATHII, a health and human rights NGO. “It may not be seen as cool to be lesbian, gay, transgender or a bisexual man. But, being a bisexual woman may be considered cool partly because of the influence of pornography developed for straight men as a lot of them have sexual scenes between two or more women,” he says.

“The idea that women together is considered a turn-on for straight guys could be one of the reasons why young women say they are bisexual as it would get the attention of straight guys or increase their desirability factor,” says Ramakrishnan. “But, though I say this, I would not want to dismiss somebody’s identity.”

Dr Reddy feels that in the present climate, there is more societal acceptance of different sexual orientations. “Many celebrities are coming out in the open and there are also more movies dealing with such subjects, which may make children think it is cool,” he says.

However, experts say that to really understand what your child is really dealing with, parents have to wait and watch, and be accepting before rushing to a professional for help. “You have to watchful and see whether your child feels the same way or not. If you feel he/ she needs help, then you should approach a counsellor or psychologist,” says Dr Reddy.*Name changed

The PM lauded the efforts of the medical team and Air India crew, saying the rescue operation has reassured the Indian diaspora across the world that the entire nation will stand by them in times of crisis. “Strength during adversity gets expression in the collective effort of Air India personnel and the medical team from Safdarjung and Ram Manohar Lohia hospitals,” he said.

The letters of appreciation were handed over to the medical team individually by union health minister Harsh Vardhan. He congratulated each and every member of the team, which had gone to Wuhan on February 1 and 2 in two batches.

The health minister also met the Indians evacuated from Wuhan at an ITBP quarantine facility, as the first batch of nearly 200 of them left for their respective homes. They have all tested negative for coronavirus, the minister said. Dr Sanjeet Panesar, assistant professor in the department of community medicine at RML hospital, told TOI he was pleasantly surprised to receive words of appreciation by the PM directly.

VIJAYAWADA: In a strong pro-student move, the Andhra Pradesh government has decided to cancel licences of schools found violating set norms. The Andhra Pradesh School Education Regulatory and Monitoring Commission ( APSERMC ), which has inspecting corporate schools and junior colleges across the state, will soon release the list of errant schools.

APSERMC chairman Justice Kantha Rao in a press conference here on Monday said corporate schools across the state are playing with the future of the children. “We have inspected the schools, which are collecting exorbitant fees from students. Most of the corporate schools do not meet teaching standards. A majority of schools are using stressful teaching methods, including pressurising students. We will soon release the list of the schools which are not following rules,” he said.

Pointing out the importance of physical activity in the overall development of the children, Rao said, “A majority of corporate schools are continuing their operations from concrete buildings. We have come to know that many schools are operating from commercial complexes and apartments. Every school should have a playground and we will soon issue notices to schools without playgrounds. These schools should relocate their campuses within the notice period, or else their recognition will be cancelled.”

Commission vice-chairperson Sarada Reddy, who was present on the occasion said, the school managements are neglecting the health of children. “Students complained about the poor quality of the food supplied in residential campuses. Many schools are not allowing students to drink water to prevent them from visiting toilets frequently. This is a serious offence and we will initiate stringent action against such schools,” she said.

Speaking on similar lines, Aluri Sambasiva Reddy, secretary of APSERMC, said several schools have been employing underqualified teachers. “ We observed that multiple teachers were dealing with a single subject in schools. This will confuse the students and affect their concentration level. The positive approach of teachers will help students in their studies and our government will frame rules to ensure this in private schools,” he said.

TRICHY: The federation of village panchayat in Trichy has urged the district administration to speed up the process of online payment system, implemented to pay for the work to be done in village panchayats. Many elected representatives are unfamiliar with the online payment system, which has developed some technical glitches as well. This is delaying basic amenities to the villagers, the federation said.

A group of village panchayat presidents, vice-presidents of village panchayats submitted a petition to Trichy collector S Sivarasu on Monday stating that they were unable to cope with the online payment system that has been introduced instead of bank cheques for all the expenses in the village panchayat.

The new local body representatives were stripped of their power of signing cheques and were authorised to spend the government fund for public purpose through an online banking system. The presidents and vice-presidents had the power to sign cheques till October 24, 2016.

As per the new system, the president and vice-president should issue a note with their signatures to the payee who can submit the note in the bank and get the money transferred to their account. The payee can be a company, a contractor or any individual.

The presidents of village panchayats said they were unable to transfer the payment to the contractors, suppliers and workers towards their work on drinking water supply, repair works, street lights, drainage and sewage cleaning etc.

“We are not opposing the online payment system and we don’t demand to bring back the cheque signing power also. As soon as the presidents take charge, they would like to do some work on the basic amenities but they can’t do now because they are unable to operate the new system for the past 45 days. We appeal to the officials to set things right in a day or two,” said Andhanallur union chairman S Durairaj who led the federation.

An official in the assistant director of village panchayats, Trichy, on condition of anonymity attributed technical glitches in the internet to the delay in the online system. “It is a usual hiccup in any new system. Things will be sorted out in a day or two,” he said.

NEW DELHI: “Ye teesra death warrant hain, umeed hai ki final ho (this is the third death warrant, I hope this is the final one),” said Nirbhaya ’s mother, Asha Devi , after a Delhi court fixed March 3 as the execution date for the four men convicted in the gang rape and murder case.Her reaction on Monday was different from what it was after the death warrant was issued for the first time. “I was very happy when the death warrant was issued for the first time, then it got postponed. Later on again their was a stay as the legal remedies available to the convicts were pending. Somewhere down the line my faith got shaken. Now when another date has been announced, there’s a new ray of hope and I hope this is the final warrant,” she said.Referring to her family’s seven-year struggle for justice, Asha Devi said they had tried to ensure that “the case reaches its logical conclusion. During these years, we have been challenged multiple times; from some comments it seemed as if I am a criminal”.One of the convicts, Pawan Gupta, is yet to file his mercy and curative petitions. “The court has given them time earlier as well, which is now over. The jail authorities had also informed them about their rights,” said Asha Devi.The fact that the juvenile who was the most brutal is roaming freely has left a permanent scar in her heart, said the mother. “The law was changed but the case happened earlier.

BHUBANESWAR: The Odisha Economic Survey, 2019-20, has pointed out that Odisha has the lowest 3.72% slum population (people living in slums of the total state population) in the country. The survey covered both urban and rural slums.

Although there has been rapid urbanisation, pointed out in the survey between 2001 and 2011 with coming up of class IV and class III towns and cities (which is about 35.06% and 25% population, respectively), the number of people living in slums is only 15.60 lakh. While the male population is 8 lakh, 7.6 lakh women live in slums with 1.9 lakh children. Bhubaneswar and Cuttack have the highest slums with population of 1.64 lakh each. Andhra Pradesh has the highest 12.04% people living in slums, followed by National Capital New Delhi and Puducherry, the survey said.

In the state, urban slum population is 22% of the total population. There are 3.50 lakh slum households in the state.

The survey has said there has been steep demographic shift from rural to urban areas, resulting in shortage of affordable space in urban areas and resulting in patches of government land being encroached on by the settlers.

The survey has focused on the government’s Jaga Mission, which is aimed at providing land rights to slum dwellers, redeveloping the slums and rehabilitating the dwellers. For this, the government had formulated Odisha Land Rights to Slum Dwellers Act, 2017.

Under the Act, the survey has highlighted that the slum dwellers get land rights for residential use and the land is heritable and can be mortgaged but not transferable. The slum dwellers in notified area councils (NACs) will get land up to 646 sqft while it is 484 sqft in municipalities. This land criterion is applicable in case of their settlement in the place, which they have occupied. But in case of relocation, 323 sqft land will be granted for each household for free.

After Bhubaneswar was accorded number one smart city in the country, the slums, coming under Bhubaneswar Town Centre District (BTCD) area, have been getting special attention. Besides, redevelopment and ensuring better sanitation and descent urban living, under socially-smart programmes, the slum children are provided self-defence training. They are also imparted other skill development training so that they can become self-reliant.

JORHAT: The All Tai Ahom Students’ Union has challenged the presidential order to amend the Bengal Eastern Frontier Regulation (BEFR) of 1873 in the Supreme Court, calling it a “politically motivated” step to deny Assam an inner-line permit system to insulate it against the new citizenship law. “We have filed a writ petition before the Supreme Court against the order of the President, dated December 11, 2019, to amend the BEFR. This is against the Constitution , unsustainable and liable to be set aside,” the student union said on Monday.

“The President passed the order for amendment under Article 372 (2) of the Constitution, although as per Article 372 (3), he has the power to do so for only three years from the date of enactment of the Constitution, i.e, till 1953,” the union claimed.

On December 24, an official release announced that the Union cabinet had given its ex-post facto approval to the Adaptation of Laws (Amendment) Order, 2019, issued by the President under Clause (2) of Article 372 of the Constitution to amend the BEFR.

The union accused the Centre of getting this done “to impose the CAA in Assam.” “According to the BEFR, 27 districts of Assam are under the purview of the BEFR and entitled to get an inner-line permit system. The Centre intentionally removed the provision to implement an inner-line permit system in Assam so that it could impose CAA. We oppose this order and, therefore, filed a writ petition challenging it in the Supreme Court on February 13. We have placed strong belief in the judiciary and are hopeful of getting justice,” the student union said.

Around 50 Pak Hindus are currently in Haridwar

HARIDWAR: A group of 50 Pakistani Hindus, who reached Haridwar on Monday to take a holy dip in Ganga , lauded the Citizenship (Amendment) Act saying that the law will give identity to those Hindus who migrated to India from Pakistan .

Amrit Lal, a trader from Larkana district of Pakistan, told TOI, “CAA is good for Pakistani Hindus who have migrated to India as they had been awaiting Indian citizenship for long. Many such Hindus had to buy land or shop in the name of their Indian relatives. This has led to many cheating cases as well. Citizenship rights will ensure their dignity.” Lal, who is on a trip to India with his family, added, “Some Pakistani Hindus want to migrate to India. However, religious discrimination is not the only reason. Some want to come here for better economic opportunities.” When asked about conditions in Pakistan, he said, “Law and order is an issue in Pakistan. Not just Hindus, but poor people of other sects also face problems. Imran Khan government is taking some measures but a lot remains to be done in this regard.”

Every year Pakistani pilgrims reach Haridwar during the summer season to take a holy dip in Ganga. During their stay, they live in different ashrams of the holy town.

Darshan Lal, from Sindh province of Pakistan, said, “Narendra Modi government’s decision is a big relief for Pakistani Hindus who have migrated here. We love our country and both the communities live peacefully there. Some old temples have also been reopened. However, security remains a big concern. Both the governments should try to soften visa regulations so that pilgrims from both sides do not face issues.” Lal runs a shop in Godki district of Pakistan’s Sindh.

JAIPUR: The Jaipur Development Authority (JDA) has issued notices to three establishments, including a Jain temple and two clubs, for disposing of garbage inside the Central Park . These establishments are situated inside and adjacent to the park.

The notices were issued to the Polo and Golf clubs on the complaint of morning walkers after they witnessed garbage strewn at various spots near these complexes.

In a notice to Polo Club, the JDA said, “In the parking of Polo Club, which is adjacent to Central Park walkway, plastic bottles, polythene bags and kitchen waste have been dumped. It’s causing pollution in the surroundings as wind pushes plastic and polythene in Central Park area.”

Similarly, a warning has been issued to the temple authorities not to dump kitchen waste in park. A senior official at JDA said, “Ideally, the club authorities should set up a plant to produce compost. If not waste should be disposed of scientifically as they are operating in eco-sensitive zone .”

In November 2017, the corporation made treatment of wet waste mandatory for government and private institutions with an area of 5,000sqm or above. It also directed them to produce compost in their own campuses. However, none of them established compost plants on their campuses.

After the corporation issued orders, a one-month deadline was given to institutions to set up compost plants of required capacity to treat wet waste. Other than the central and state government offices, it was also made mandatory for commercial establishments such as hospitals, clubs, hotels, schools, colleges and restaurants which generate over 100kg of waste daily. However, the corporation did not make efforts to impose the orders.

A source at JMC said, “Initially, 77 properties in the city were shortlisted where compost plants were proposed to be established. But, of these properties, not even 10% have set up the plant.”

BAGESHWAR: “As the journey progressed, I conquered my fears,” says Pradeep Rana (21), who travelled from Dehradun to Cambodia while covering Nepal, Bhutan, Bangladesh, Myanmar, Thailand, Laos, and Vietnam. He peddled for 9,000 kilometres during the course of his journey, which aimed at spreading the message of environmental conservation, love, and peace.

Rana, who is a resident of Bageshwar’s Rithad village, embarked on the journey on September 18, 2019, from Dehradun’s Graphic Era, from where he is pursuing MSc (IT). His father Kishan is a farmer and social worker. He has been working to spread awareness regarding scientific farming among the local people in Bageshwar district for years.

""Crossing the international border for the first time in my life and that too on a bicycle was a thrilling and a scary experience for me,'' Rana told TOI during a phone conversation. He said that the money for the journey was arranged through crowd-funding. “Many people, who hail from Uttarakhand or other parts of India and are settled abroad, donated money for this journey,” informed Rana, who plans to peddle to countries like Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia, Japan, South Korea, and others.

""When I started my journey from Dehradun, I had just planned to cycle to six countries but the people that I met during my journey encouraged and funded me to explore more territory. At present, I have enough funds to go to Malaysia and then to Singapore. However, I will try to raise more funds so I can travel to other Asian nations like Indonesia, Brunei, Philippines, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, China, and others,"" Rana added.

Sharing experience of his trip, Rana said, ""I stayed in Buddhist temples in Thailand and Laos. Indian restaurants in every city of Vietnam provided me with a free meal to support my journey. My college and the community of people from our state living in Singapore helped me a lot financially.''

Notably, this isn’t Rana’s first such adventure. In 2017, he cycled 18,671 km across India. Back then, he wished to register his name in the Guinness Book of World Records but couldn’t break the record set by an Australian cyclist .

When asked about his source of inspiration for such journeys, Rana said, ""During my trip across India in 2017, I realised that travelling makes you generous and tolerant. You witness the diversity of this beautiful planet and start believing in co-existence. Since childhood, I have been fond of travelling and cycling.""

DEHRADUN: After sitting on hunger strike for 66 days, Ganga crusader Padmavati was reported to be in an ‘unconscious state’ on Monday morning. Fearing threat to her life, seers of Haridwar-based Matri Sadan ashram took her to a local hospital from where she was referred to AIIMS-Delhi after the ashram refused to admit the seer to any government hospital in Uttarkhand , including AIIMS-Rishikesh citing threat to her life from doctors and the administration.

Matri Sadan seer Dayanand, who accompanied Padmavati to Delhi, said, “They have killed professor GD Agrawal at AIIMS-Rishikesh and have also tried to kill seer Aatmabodhanand. So Padmavati has been taken to AIIMS-Delhi. So far, all her vitals are okay but she is unconscious and doctors have said that she is in mental trauma.”

Seers have also alleged that police and district administration tried to stop them from going to Delhi, thus further risking her life.

Dayanand alleged, “We were stopped for over two hours at Bahadrabad by police and administration, who wanted to take the seer to AIIMS Rishikesh. Surprisingly, they also said that they would airlift Padmavati to Delhi from Rishikesh. If they were so concerned, then they could have offered to do the same from Haridwar as well.”

Shivanand Saraswati, head of Matri Sadan ashram, said, “Padmavati had refused treatment by doctors of the state government. However, even then, those doctors, who were involved in killing our previous seers, were sent to check her. Two days ago, these doctors pasted a notice outside the seer’s room stating that she needs to be referred to a higher centre. And after that, she slipped into a state of shock. On Monday morning, when I went to see her, she was only chanting ‘Om’ and after that she stopped talking.”

Meanwhile, Bahadrabad SHO Gopal Kumar said that the seer’s ambulance was stopped for just five minutes. “Going by the orders, we had stopped the ambulance to ask them if they want to opt for the airlifting option as the patient’s condition was critical.”

Haridwar sub-divisional magistrate Kusum Chauhan said that no notice was pasted by the district administration team at the ashram. “The seer is not doing any mediation, she is on indefinite hunger strike as stated in her demands. That’s why it is our moral responsibility to save her life. We have been requesting her to end her fast but she is not ready to listen. We had gone to the ashram to save her as her medical reports showed deteriorated health. And eventually she had to be rushed to a hospital.”

Prakash is almost bankrupt now after suffering losses of around Rs 40 lakh. That afternoon eight shops of the area were reduced to ashes due to the negligence of one crackers shopkeeper who was given licence by authorities to run an outlet in a congested lane.“What was my fault. Both my shops have been totally gutted. I have lost everything without any mistake of my own. It will take me years to get on my feet,” Prakash said.A crackers shopkeeper at Indira Bazaar was giving a demo of a cracker to a customer when things spiralled out of control and within two minutes entire area was engulfed in fire. It took five fire tenders four hours to douse the fire. The congested lanes even made it difficult for fire officials to work.Bhagwan Das, who had a garments shop in front of the fire crackers shop, said he recently purchased materials worth thousands of rupees material for the shop. “Christmas, Sankranti, Valentines Day and many other special occasions were good business opportunities for us.

NEW DELHI: Shaheen Bagh is an idea that is bulletproof: the women at the 24x7 dharna in Delhi’s southeast neighbourhood echoed this sentiment on Monday, as Supreme Court ’s observations on the protest came in.The apex court, while recognising their right to protest, reiterated that there should be a balance between dissent and flow of traffic. “We know that SC has asked mediators to come and speak to us. But we have made our position clear. We want this law to be repealed,” said Ruby, a 22-year-old, as she announced the next speaker to address the protesters from the makeshift stage.“Hum watan pe tan mann lutaney pe hain. Humko malum hai hum nishane pe hain (we are ready to sacrifice our body and soul for the nation, we know we are the target),” the woman protester in a black hijab sang, amid a thundering applause. Her self-composed song was rusty, and her voice faltered, but the message was clear: the women will continue their fight against CAA, NRC and NPR. The site of protest may change, but their resolve will remain unfettered.On Twitter, too, the official handle of the protest site acknowledged the SC observation. “SC has denied any direct state action. Delhi Police directed to identify alternative site for protest,” it tweeted, adding that they “look forward to a mutually beneficial dialogue” with Delhi Police.The women say they are ready for a conversation, but on their own terms. They also acknowledge their responsibility of furthering the movement. “We are here today. We, the women, have to always remember thousands of people who gathered in our support in so many places… There is a responsibility,” said a woman in her 50s.The dadis also have a word of advice for the interlocutors. “Yahan makan nahin banaya hai (we haven’t constructed permanent houses here). We have always opened the road for ambulances and emergencies. We are ready to talk. But everyone needs to be consulted,” said Bilkis Bano, an 82-year-old who has become one of the most recognisable faces of the protest.The residents of the area are not indifferent to the concerns raised by SC and they believe that dialogues can lead to a resolution. Taseer Ahmad, a ‘volunteer-in-chief’ who helped with the overall arrangement from the start, said “the court has agreed to our right to protest”.“No resident welfare association from neighbouring Sarita Vihar and Okhla Vihar has come to address the people here. It is wrong to say they are not supporting us. This is an open platform. If they had real problems with us, they would have surely approached us,” Ahmad said.Read this article in BengaliIn Video: Shaheen Bagh protests: Supreme Court names 3 mediators",delhi,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74183369,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-231508,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/voice-from-shaheen-bagh-site-may-change-but-sit-in-to-go-on/articleshow/74182375.cms

The recent Indira Bazaar fire mishap.

JAIPUR: The Walled City market association has flagged the issue of giving licenses to firecracker shopkeepers to function in the congested lanes following the recent Indira Bazaar fire mishap.

Licenses to such shops are being issued by police commissionerate while following certain provisions of the Explosives Act 2008 that mentions that firecracker shops should be on a safe distance from residential areas with proper road connectivity. As per police sources, most of the shops in the Walled City area are being granted licenses since 1960, which is still being continued.

“Three decades ago the population and traffic in the Walled City was low. Now, when the lanes have become congested and small fire incidents can cause heavy damage to life and property, this should be reviewed by the administration,” said a police official.

Indira Bazaar, which is known for cloth shops, has 15 cracker shops in the same lane where the fire incident took place.

Subhash Goyal, president of Jaipur Vyapaar Mandal, said these incidences can be avoided only when firecracker shops are shifted outside Walled City.

“Cracker shops should be shifted outside the Walled City. The verandahs in front of the shops in Indira Bazaar have been destroyed and will take a long time to be repaired. Prakash and other businessmen should be provided with compensation from the government and an undertaking must be signed by cracker shop owners to pay for losses if any damage is caused due to their negligence,” Subhash said.

A case has been registered against the owner and his license has been suspended till further notice by police.

Jagdish Keswani, general secretary of Indira Bazaar Market Association , was seen vehemently supporting the idea of shifting firecracker shops outside the market. “There are 800 shops in Indira Bazaar and these 15 firecracker shops can destroy the entire market. Before granting the license, an undertaking must be signed by these shopkeepers stating that any mishap will be their responsibility so that in such situation someone can be held liable for financial losses of others,” Jagdish said.

VIJAYAWADA: Vijayawada Municipal Corporation (VMC) and Krishna district administration on Monday intensified efforts to identify land for beneficiaries of Housing for all Poor scheme. Ward volunteers went door-to-door and took consent forms from beneficiaries on the day. Authorities have proposed to give land in the Amaravati capital region to eligible beneficiaries residing in slums across the city.

The civic body, which initially proposed to construct G+3 apartments for the eligible poor, has now decided to give away plots of land. With the government promising to give one cent of land to each eligible family, officials are busy identifying around 800 acres of land to be given to to the 80,000 eligible beneficiaries.

The government’s proposal to allocate one cent of land has elicited mixed responses from beneficiaries. “Bearing house rents has become a major concern for us. We thought that the government will give us the house. But ward volunteers informed that the government will give us one cent of land in Mandadam village which is very far from the city. The government should at least give two cents for construction of the house,” said K Devarani, a resident of Gattenaka area.

Meanwhile, opposition parties criticised the consent forms collected by the VMC and the decision to allocate land in the capital region. “ Plots of land in Amaravati were sacrificed by farmers for construction of the capital. We heard that officials of VMC are collecting consent forms from people for allocation of house sites in Mandadam and other villages. The government should first allocate the completed houses in Jakkampudi area,” CPM state secretariat member Ch Babu Rao said.

JAIPUR: Parliamentary affairs minister Shanti Dhariwal on Monday assured the Assembly that the then Excise Inspector Lokesh Kumar and District Excise Officer, Dausa, Laxminarayan Devanda were issued charge sheet under CCA Rule-16 and 17 respectively for irregularities in liquor shop allocation at Hadiya village on Jaipur-Agra national highway.

Independent MLA Om Prakash Hudla has alleged that an excise officer in Dausa sanctioned liquor shops on Jaipur-Agra National Highway in violation of rules, but the government failed to initiate action against him.

Raising the issue during Zero Hour, Hudla said the issue was brought to the notice of the government on January 27 but it did not act against the official who flouted the rules. He raised the issue again in the assembly through a call attention motion on Monday.

Parliamentary affairs minister Shanti Dhariwal said the officer had been served a notice under Rajasthan Civil Service rules 16 CC. But the minister’s reply did not satisfy the MLA and the speaker.

Speaker Joshi asked the minister whether he was ready suspend the official as such a move would send out a message that the government would not tolerate violation of the law.

The minister said he will act, but due process had to be followed.

276,['18/02/2020'],Will honour the right to protest &amp; that of public life: Shaheen Bagh mediators,"This story is from February 18, 2020

NEW DELHI: India’s first chief information commissioner, a Supreme Court lawyer often sparring on, and sometimes with, Twitter, and an SC advocate with 42 years’ experience: the three interlocutors asked to mediate with protesters at Shaheen Bagh struck a cautious note on Monday when news of their appointment broke, but agreed that both the right to protest and that of public life would be honoured.

“I really have no idea. I’ve only read reports of this and not received any official communication,” said Wajahat Habibullah. The former CIC and J&K interlocutor has been a vocal critic of the way things were handled in Kashmir — from the writing down of Article 370 to the killing of “militants” by armed forces in encounters.

When it came to Shaheen Bagh, the former chairperson of the National Commission for Minorities stood up for the right to protest again. After a petition was filed in Supreme Court to remove the anti-CAA protesters at Shaheen Bagh because the “blockade” was considered a “disruption” to public life, he joined Bhim Army chief Chandrashekhar Azad in filing an impleadment application. “We had petitioned Supreme Court saying that no harm should be brought to the women and children at Shaheen Bagh, whatever be the legal position SC upholds,” he said.

But that petition does not apply to what comes next, he said. “If the court asks me to assist the interlocutors, I will naturally have to look at it from the point of view that the court expects. I don’t know, at this point, what the court expects,” he added.

Supreme Court advocate Sanjay Hegde, too, held back on committing to any roadmap. “I don’t want to speak right now about anything. Whatever statement has to be made will be made by me and Sadhana Ramachandran together,” he said. The firebrand Hegde, a Supreme Court lawyer since 2015, has taken up the cudgels on behalf of the families of mob lynching victims, Aarey protesters and those excluded from NRC.

Sadhana Ramachandran, practicing in Supreme Court since 1978, has been a senior mediator in SC and has been working with the Delhi High Court Mediation and Conciliation Centre.

“We will be meeting all the parties … to resolve their issues in a manner that respects and safeguards both the right to protest and the requirements of orderly civic life. We hope that our assistance leads to these matters being resolved in good faith and to the satisfaction of all parties,” said a joint statement issued by Hegde and Ramachandran.

277,['18/02/2020'],Kashmir news: Centre begins process of delimitation of assembly seats in J&amp;K,"This story is from February 18, 2020

NEW DELHI: In a move that will pave the way for assembly elections in the Union Territory of J&K, the Centre has begun the process of fresh delimitation of assembly seats as well as readjustment of boundaries of parliamentary constituencies.

The move comes more than six months after abrogation of Article 370 in J&K and three-and-a-half months since the state of J&K was reorganised into the UTs of J&K and Ladakh.

Sources told TOI that the law secretary wrote to chief election commissioner Sunil Arora on Monday stating that the government had decided to go ahead with constitution of the Delimitation Commission provided for in the Jammu and Kashmir Reorganisation Act, 2019. The panel, to be set up under Section 3 of the Delimitation Act of 2002, will be headed by a serving or retired judge of the Supreme Court, with the CEC or an election commissioner nominated by him and the state election commissioner of the UT concerned as its ex-officio members.

The law secretary requested the CEC to confirm himself as a member of the delimitation panel or nominate an election commissioner for the job. Arora chose to nominate election commissioner Sushil Chandra for the panel. A communication in this regard has gone to the law secretary.

The delimitation process may take at least four months. Assembly polls in J&K, which is currently under President’s rule, can be held after that. The delimitation, which will be carried out based on 2011 Census figures, is expected to address Jammu region’s long-standing demand for better representation in the assembly.

The last time a delimitation exercise took place in J&K was in 1995. The state was under President’s rule even then, as the delimitation panel headed by Justice K K Gupta (retd) went about the exercise in extremely difficult circumstances.

As per Section 60 of J&K Reorganisation Act, the number of seats in the legislative assembly shall be increased from 107 to 114. Delimitation of constituencies must be carried out to determine the number of seats to be reserved for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes in the assembly. The delimitation panel will also determine the assembly constituencies into which the UT shall be divided, the extent of such constituencies and which of these shall be reserved for SCs/STs. The panel is also tasked with adjustment of boundaries and description of the extent of parliamentary constituencies in each UT.

A presidential notification had earlier corrected an anomaly pertaining to Section 63 of J&K Reorganisation Act, which stated that “until the relevant figures for the first census taken after the year 2026 have been published, it shall not be necessary to readjust the division of successor UT of J&K into assembly and parliamentary constituencies”. The President on October 31 suspended operation of this section.

Ludhiana: With the district administration and the police launching a crackdown on vehicles not following the Safe School Vahan Policy on Monday, parents and students were a harried lot as the violator vehicles played hooky.

While many parents had to drop and pick up their children from schools, some school vehicle drivers shifted children to other vehicles ahead of the checkpoint.

Neha Sharma, a homemaker and resident of Old City, said, “Usually, the bus arrives till 8am to pick up my son. But when it did not come till 8.15am, I called up the driver. He said he was not coming due to some issues. I had to rush to drop my son to school.”

Lalit Bagga, a dying unit owner of Kirpal Nagar, said, “When the school bus driver did not turn up, I called him up. He said he will not be able to come for a few days as the district administration has started a checking drive. I first dropped my son to school and then went to office. In the afternoon, I left office to pick up my son. Despite the hassle we faced, we appreciate the checking drive as it will ensure our children’s safety.”

Deepak Sood, a banker from Civil Lines, said, “My wife and I were getting ready for our offices when the school van driver informed us that he will not be coming today. We had to hurry as our children’s school does not let latecomers in. During the drive, the administration should ask the schools to allow students if they are late. Else, there will be much chaos.”

While Regional Transport Authority and SDMs challaned and impounded the violator vehicles, the police gave seven-day notice to those whose vehicles failed to abide by a few rules.

Commissioner of police Rakesh Agarwal said, “Police are not focusing on issuing challans. Our motive is to make drivers follow the rules. Therefore, on first day of the drive, the police have issued over 500 notices to school vehicle drivers, giving them seven days to comply with the rules.”

Assistant commissioner of police (traffic) Gurdev Singh said, “Police have impounded buses that were in poor condition, challaned those that were violating more than two rules and issued notices to those whose violation count was less. Those served notices will have to comply with rules in a week, after which action will be taken against the non-complying ones.”

Akhara (Jagraon): NRIs have helped the local government primary school wear an attractive look, drawing a large number of students.

The village has a sizeable number of NRIs who contribute to education, apart from other development works here. “The institute had come up in 1950 and was upgraded to high school. As it was outside the village, young children faced problems in going there and so the enrolment dropped. However, after the school was shifted to the heart of the village, the number of students swelled. Some years ago, paint of the building started coming off. At that time, a group of youth in the village thought that instead of donating money to religious places, it should be contributed towards education. They then informed the NRIs,” said head teacher Lakhvir Singh.

“The idea was to make school building vibrant with colourful messages about education so that students find it an attractive place. Since children have a liking for trains, we got walls painted like locomotives with doors and windows. Apart from that, we got pillars painted with pictures and names of body parts, 10 Sikh gurus, freedom struggle messages and math tables. The attractive ambience is drawing more students. As of now, we have 200 students and have enrolled 20 more who would join soon,” he added.

A Class V student Jasmeen Kaur said, “It is a dream to go somewhere on a train someday. I am happy to see a train almost every day at my school. Besides, I also love to learn about parts of body, tables, plants, planets, among others, painted on walls.”

The village leaders said NRIs also help in development works. “There are around 400 NRIs from the village of over 7,000. Not only have they helped in improving education, but also contributed to overall development with projects like tree plantation and cleanliness, among others,” said sarpanch Sukhjeet Singh.

An NRI said by contributing to the development of the village, they were just trying to pay back to their native place and don’t want credit for it.

Swings, generators needed, says teacher

Harnarayan Singh, one of the seven teachers at the school, said whenever NRIs met them, they asked about other requirements at the school. He said they have asked them to provide funds for swings and generators as there were more students now. He said there were 11 rooms in the school and seven teachers, including five women teachers. “We are setting up a herbal garden and have planted tulsi, curry leaves and jamun plants there,” he added.

KOCHI: After more than two years since the completion of works on Metro pillars across Kaniyampuzha backwaters near Vyttila Mobility Hub, Metro authorities have demolished a bund constructed across the waterbody obstructing the flow of water.It was following a series of reports published in TOI questioning the Metro authorities’ apathy that they pulled down the bund.While constructing the bund more than three years ago, Metro authorities had promised that they would demolish the structure once the work on the pillars across the backwaters is over. But the Metro authorities didn’t keep their promise and the bund obstructed the flow of water, thereby causing waterlogging in many places on the banks of Kaniyampuzha. “We had asked Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC), which constructed the bund, to take necessary action. Now, they have informed us that they demolished the bund,” said Kochi Metro Rail Ltd (KMRL) managing director Alkesh Kumar Sharma. Metro authorities have removed at least two metre-deep mud so as to demolish the bund.The bund was constructed across the backwaters for facilitating the movement of heavy vehicles, including containers, to reach the stacking yards of the Metro project located under the pillars of the viaduct. The bund was as wide as a four-lane highway. “It is a welcome move that the Metro authorities demolished the bund,” said RTI activist K T Cheshire, who had lodged a complaint with Metro authorities demanding demolition of the structure.Now, the bund along the width of around 30m have been demolished. Still, the authorities haven’t removed the mud used for reclaiming the creek, which was spread across the wetland in the area. “They reclaimed the creek up to at least 100m. They should remove the mud used for filling the creek as well,” Cheshire said. There were allegations that the Metro authorities were reluctant to demolish the bund so as to help somebody, who purchased land in the Silver Sand Island which is being connected through the bund. “Now, a realtor who has presence all across the nation is learnt to have purchased land in the island. If the creek is not restored, the realtor can later use the reclaimed land as road. Given the fact that the realtors are very influential, they will also manage to secure nod for constructing a bridge across the 30-metre-wide stretch of the backwaters where the Metro authorities demolished the bund,” Cheshire said. “Moreover, the Metro authorities constructed three pillars in the waterbody. As per the normal distance between two pillars, it would have required just two pillars to cover the 30-metre distance of the backwaters. The act of Metro authorities raise suspicion that their aim is to help realtors,” Cheshire said.Meanwhile, it is learnt that there is a plan to construct a bridge across the river to the island side from the mobility hub area. Officials associated with the Metro agency visited the area and explored the possibilities of constructing a bridge. They said that the plan to construct bridge is mooted by one builder in the island.",kochi,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74187624,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-60811,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/metro-authorities-demolish-bund-across-kaniyampuzha-backwaters/articleshow/74181375.cms

Kozhikode: Government Medical College authorities here have decided to introduce ‘ floating ward’ concept at all the four hospitals situated in its campus to resolve the shortage of beds. Shortage of beds forces the patients to lie on the floors during their hospital stay.

If the proposal materializes, various departments will share available beds in their wards to accommodate patients from other wards to resolve the complaints on dearth of beds.

The facility will be introduced in all the four hospitals — Kozhikode Government Medical College Hospital , Institute of Maternal and Child Health , Institute of Chest Diseases and Super Specialty Hospital.

The medical college authorities have commenced the floating ward concept on an experimental basis at the Kozhikode Government Medical College Hospital (KGMCH). It has set up a floating ward at the medicine ward one in the initial phase. KGMCH authorities have informed that they will make use of the geriatric ward, which is now being used as an isolation ward for coronavirus infection, as floating ward once the government withdraws the isolation facility.

A decision on setting up floating ward was taken at a meeting of the hospital development core committee chaired by district collector Sambasiva Rao on February 15. The meeting was held to discuss about solutions to rectify the anomalies in the medical college campus.

According to the medical college authorities, on an average, a minimum of 5,500 patients per day visit the various outpatients wings of the four hospitals. The dearth of beds often forces the inpatients to lay on the hospital floors during their stay at the hospitals for treatment.

Dr V R Rajendran, principal of the Kozhikode Government Medical College said that with the introduction of the floating ward concept, we hope to resolve existing complaints of bed shortage to a certain extent. “We have started the trial run at the Kozhikode Government Medical College hospital which witnesses the highest number of patients flow per day. The facility will be expanded to all the other three hospitals in the medical college campus in a phased manner,” he said.

Alappuzha: These days it is not an easy task to get experienced persons for taking care of women in their postpartum and the new-born baby, even in rural areas.

People also face difficulties to get workers to make arrangements for wedding and funeral rituals. People of Thanneermukkom and its neighbouring villages don’t want to get worried. Thanneermukkom grama panchayat has started a women-only event management group for solving all these issues.

The event management group named ‘Smart Thanneermukkom’ will help bachelors and bachelorettes to find a life partner and the group will also arrange the wedding venue, cook and serve food for the guests of their weddings

Thanneermukkom panchayat chief P S Jyothis said, their event management group would provide well-trained event management members for nursing the woman and her infant soon after delivery. “All villages are developing, but if somebody died, it is a tough task to find people for making arrangements for the funeral, even in rural areas. So, we also have a women team for meeting such needs. Our team will come and will provide our service for the funeral. The panchayat authorities have bought a casket costing Rs 1.5 lakh for the event management team,” said the panchayat president.

The implementing agency of this project is Community Development Society (CDS), the panchayat-level apex body of the Kudumbashree. If a villager needs the service of the event management group, they can approach the CDS and book the team. There will also be a fee and rent for the service of the team.

“The event management members have been undergoing training for the last one month to prepare for the services. The service of the group will be available from March.

Every day, close to 80-100 people fly into the city from Singapore.Meanwhile, many Coimbatorians who have booked tickets and trips to Singapore in February and March, are desperately calling helplines and travel agents, trying to get at least a portion of their trip refunded or rescheduling their tickets and bookings.Many of them stand to lose close to Rs 1.2 lakh each, because they are choosing to cautiously not travel now.The Singapore tourism board has acknowledged the panic but maintains that their country and tourist attractions are open, and thus no refunds will be ordered.The public health department on Monday confirmed that they have begun requesting even asymptomatic patients landing in the district from Singapore, to home quarantine themselves for two weeks, which will be incubation period for the virus. “Unlike passengers coming from China, where we compulsorily tell them to home quarantine themselves and carefully monitor them through the 28-day period, even without symptoms, we only request asymptomatic patients from Singapore to home quarantine themselves for two weeks,” said deputy director of public health, Dr Ramesh.Patients who fly in after visiting and spending a few days in Singapore, and show symptoms of the flu, are told to home quarantine themselves for 28 days and if their condition gets more serious, to get tested for the virus. “Since cases in Singapore are rising, we have decided to closely monitor patients from Singapore who show symptoms of the flu while passing our thermal scanners,” said the deputy director.“We are giving refunds only to passengers who have a travel history of China.

Sharjeel Imam

NEW DELHI: The special investigating team (SIT) probing the Jamia Millia Islamia clashes has arrested JNU student Sharjeel Imam , already in custody in a sedition case, allegedly for inciting violence.

The arrest was made after one of his associates reportedly told the Crime Branch that Imam had abetted some local youths to block the Shaheen Bagh road and put up a violent resistance to the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA).

SIT on Monday got Imam’s remand for a day to question him about his role after the December 13 speech, which allegedly acted as a trigger for the violent clashes between Jamia residents and police. DCP (crime) Rajesh Deo said Imam, who was in judicial custody, had been charged with rioting after his role in instigating rioters became clear. “Apart from analysing his speech, we questioned a number of local residents and people known to him who acknowledged his role in abetting the violent outburst later. He will be questioned further on this,” Deo said.

An investigating officer claimed despite being a JNU student, Imam used to spend most of his time at Jamia. During his stay with some Jamia students on the campus, he planned the agitation, the officer alleged, adding that Imam incited locals of Taimoor Nagar and Batla House by convincing them that only a violent protest would draw attention to their cause.

Some locals allegedly said Imam had termed it to be a second freedom struggle. “Prima facie, a probe suggests that the trouble was planned beforehand,” an officer claimed.

Imam’s associates reportedly said they had distributed pamphlets in New Friend’s Colony and Jamia areas on December 13 and 14, prompting many locals to join the protest. It has also been found that Imam had paid the money from his bank account to print 5,000 copies of three anti-CAA posters he had designed, a cop said. The WhatsApp groups through which Imam was keeping in touch with his associates had been tampered with, he added.

293,['18/02/2020'],Jaipur: Guru Golwalkar Jan Bhagidari Vikas Yojana named after Gandhi,"This story is from February 18, 2020

Representative image

JAIPUR: The state’s Congress government has changed the name of Guru Golwalkar Jan Bhagidari Vikas Yojana, under rural development and panchayati raj department, to Mahatma Gandhi Jan Bhagidari Vikas Yojana as a mark of respect to the country’s Father of the Nation on his 150th birth anniversary.

M S Golwalkar was the second sarsanghchalak of Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) and was one of the most prominent ideologues of Hindutva.

State BJP president Satish Poonia slammed the state government saying it “practices politics of hatred”. “In this country, all great men are the equal. They are all important to us. Both Mahatma Gandhi and Guru Golwalkar are respected in our country.”

“They (Congress) sometimes talk about removing pictures (of the leaders) or removing the characters from the syllabus or change the name of the schemes. The name of Atal Seva Kendra (named after former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee ) was changed to Rajiv Gandhi Seva Kendra. It is in their nature to worship the Gandhi family, and, hence they try to score political mileage by doing such things. As per political tradition, this is absolutely wrong. However, this government is encouraging such a tradition. We will again change the name (of the scheme) when we come to power,” he added.

This is the third time the name of this scheme has been changed by the state government. Initially, the name of scheme was Apna Gaon, Apna Kaam when it was introduced in 1991-92. It was changed by Gehot government to Jan Bhagidari Yojana during his second term, 2009-2013. When Vasundhara Raje-led BJP government came to power, the name of the scheme was changed to Guru Golwalkar Jan Bhagidari Yojana in 2014.

“The file pertaining to changing the name of the scheme on its guidelines has been sent to chief minister’s office (CMO) for approval,” said an official.

Under the scheme, 30 per cent of the funds are generated through public contribution and 70 per cent is funded by the government. The fund is used for all kinds of community building works in villages. These include building schools, roads, community halls, toilets etc.

In Rajasthan, the priority was changed to building and renovation of cemetries and burial grounds in the villages as per 2014 guidelines.

294,['18/02/2020'],Anti-rabies serum used in only 7% dog bite cases last year,"This story is from February 18, 2020

Bengaluru: The vital anti-rabies serum was administered in just 7% of the dog bite cases reported in Bengaluru during 2019. The figure is a cause of concern for doctors , who say ARS should be used in every case.

A 31-year-old Cox Town woman who did not avail treatment after she was bitten by a stray dog four months back died of rabies in a city hospital on Saturday. This was the second rabies-related death in BBMP limits this year.

According to data with BBMP’s public health information and epidemiological cell (PHIEC), 8,994 dog bite cases were reported last year and ARS or rabies immunoglobulin was used only in 661. The cell collates reasons for hospital visits by patients.

Factors like severity of the dog bite, whether its caused by a stray or pet and the animal’s vaccination status are crucial to decide the mode of treatment. However, doctors say ARS should be given irrespective of the severity. Victims’ families are asked to keep track of the dog as it could die if it’s rabid.

ARS is the first line of treatment and has to be followed by the rabies vaccine. It provides a protective mechanism before the vaccine shows effects. Incidentally, 5,785 (64%) of dog bite cases reported last year involved strays, according to BBMP statistics.

Oversight and lack of awareness regarding treatment are major concerns, say doctors. “In case of a dog bite, overtreatment is fine so that rabies can be prevented. The serum reacts immediately and kills the rabies virus before it enters the human nervous system. Once it enters the nerves, there is no medicine to treat it and it’s 100% fatal. The best thing is to treat dog bites with ARS, along with the rabies vaccine. While the vaccine takes 14 days to work, the serum provides antibodies immediately,” explained Dr NR Ramesh Masthi, professor and head, department of community medicine, Kempegowda Institute of Medical Sciences (KIMS). The hospital treats at least 200 cases of dog bite a month.

According to BBMP data, 8338 vials of the rabies vaccine were administered in Bengaluru last year. However, it is not clear how many dog bite victims were administered the vaccine. Depending on the severity and nature of the dog bite, a patient is administered up to 28 doses of 0.1 ml. The BBMP data is not clear about the vial size.

“The number of dog bite victims given ARS is low but if patients have gone to private hospitals enrolled with PHIEC, we may not have the exact figure,” said BBMP authorities.

“One must go to a doctor and avail the required treatment. Ignoring a dog bite can prove costly as was the case of the Cox Town woman,” said Dr Vijay Kumar Annayya Reddy, consultant, critical care medicine, Vikram Hospital, who treated her.

According Dr Ansar Ahmed, medical superintendent, Epidemic Diseases Hospital (earlier known as Isolation Hospital) on Old Madras Road, 15 cases of rabies were reported in 2019. “All rabies cases are fatal. This year, we have seen one case each from Nelamangala, Shivamogga, Ballari and Hanumanthnagar in BBMP limits,” he said.

Box: Wash wound with soap water first

In case of dog bite, the first thing to do is to wash the wound with detergent soap (hard soap) and water, said Dr NR Ramesh Masthi, professor and head, department of community medicine, KIMS hospital. Further medical care is necessary with ARS and the vaccine.

“There is a lack of awareness among many patients. Even now we get dog bite cases where lime, juice of green leaves and chilli powder have been the first line of treatment,” he added.

295,['18/02/2020'],Corporator’s move to inspect another ward miffs peers,"This story is from February 18, 2020

Bengaluru: A turf war is brewing in the BBMP council, with BJP member KA Munindra Kumar’s decision to conduct an inspection of road and drain works in Kuvempunagar rankling corporators, cutting across party lines.

The aggrieved Kuvempunagar corporator, VV Prathibha Rajan of Congress, has got support from mayor M Goutham Kumar, who too has taken exception to his party colleague, Munindra’s decision.

According to the BBMP rulebook and code of conduct, a councillor can inspect only his or her ward and has no authority to inspect others. If s/he does so, then the corporator of that ward, mayor or the commissioner have to be informed. Only the mayor, commissioner or joint commissioners can inspect wards across the city, Goutham Kumar said.

Munindra represents Jakkur ward, and the only link between Jakkur and Kuvempunagar wards is that they fall in Byatarayanapura assembly constituency.

Asserting that Munindra is not her leader, Prathibha said, “Except for the mayor, no one is permitted to visit other councillors ’ wards for inspection. Seems like Munindra is making new rules.”

Munindra said, “A couple of residents from Kuvempunagar ward visited my office and complained about horrible roads, overflowing drains and other problems.” To address their woes, he wrote to the joint commissioner three days ago to arrange for an inspection of the ward. “The opposition party is unnecessarily making it a political issue. I have no hidden interest,” he added.

The inspection was slated for Tuesday but has now been put off to next week, sources said.

While Munindra claimed the mayor will accompany him on the inspection, Goutham Kumar said, “No way. I will accompany him only if it is a tour of his Jakkur ward.”

Hyderabad: Tree plantation has gone hi-tech in Telangana with city-based startup Marut Drones pressing its drones into service for dropping seed balls in Veernapalli in Sircilla as part of the Telangana government’s Haritha Haaram programme.

Explaining the process, Marut Drones co-founder Prem Kumar Vislawath said, drones are first used to survey and map the terrain that helps determine the number of trees to be grown based on various parameters like soil and climate, among others, following which seedballs are created by local communities and dropped by drones in the targeted areas.

On Monday, drones did seeding by releasing over 15,000 seed balls, consisting of Velaga, Gangaravi, Gummadi Teak, Seema Chinta, Raavi and Sitaphal seeds , from around 40 to 50 feet above the ground in Sircilla.

He pointed out that the advantage of using drones is that it can accomplish the task much faster and the path followed by the drones are geotagged, facilitating periodic monitoring of the sown area to collect tree statistics.

“The entire process cuts down on manpower, time, danger to the tree-planters and results in nearly 10-fold reduction in the cost of forest landscape reforestation,” he said.

In fact, the box for releasing the seed balls was 3D-printed with the help of technology developed at T-Works, a state-run incubator for electronics startups.

Founded by a team of Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Guwahati alumni, Marut Drones has been mentored by T-Works and RICH and was recently selected for Facebook’s India Innovation Accelerator Programme.

With its drones being used for seeding, Marut Drones intends to make reforestation scalable through ‘Drone Swarms’ that can plant up to 1 lakh trees a day. The startup has also built India’s first drone to eradicate mosquito larvae and water hyacinth and has tested its solutions in some of the lakes in and around the city.

HYDERABAD: Passengers aboard a TSRTC bus at Vikarabad’s Tandur bus station had a ride to forget when a man in a drunken state took to the wheel. On Monday evening, while the actual driver was having a meal, the man got into the bus, took the driver’s seat and started the engine. However, the ride came to an end when the man was forced to stop by enraged passengers who had started objecting to his rash driving.

When questioned by passengers, the man claimed that he was the driver-cum-conductor of the bus. As irate passengers called up the depot to lodge a complaint against their “drunk driver”, authorities told them that the man they were complaining about was not really their driver. Before passengers could catch the man, he gave them the slip and ran away.

Tandur depot manager Rajasekhar told TOI that the bus had been parked near the edge at the depot by the actual driver for passengers to get in. With the bus parked, the bus driver and conductor had gone to the canteen to have their dinner. To their surprise, the bus had vanished upon their return.

Worried, the driver informed the security who immediately launched a search. It was only when they got a call from one of the passengers when they came to know that someone had driven away with the bus.

Following the incident, a complaint was lodged by the depot manager at the Tandur police station. “The police is trying to identify the accused and arrest him,” the depot manager said. Asked how the person could have driven away with the bus, the manager said that since the bus had a self-start switch which the man had used to start the bus which was not locked.

Depot authorities were also told that the man had hit another vehicle while driving the bus. However, upon inspection, no other vehicle was found near the site.

COIMBATORE: The government railway police (GRP) at Mettupalayam have arrested five people for sexually assaulting a 17-year-old Chennai-based girl

Preliminary inquiry revealed that the incident happened six months ago. “Malarvizhi of Medavakkam, a tout involved in flesh trade, had offered the minor girl a job as a live-in maid. But she handed the girl over to five local youths, who raped her several times,” a police officer said.

The girl’s parents, who came to know about the incident, reprimanded her. “It prompted her to leave the house. She took a train to Mettupalayam and was roaming in the Mettupalayam railway station when call taxi driver Manikandan approached her. He promised to get a job for her in Mettupalayam and also offered to accommodate her in his house. He raped her twice,” the officer said.

The girl left for Chennai after two days. A few days ago, she was taken to a government hospital in Chennai, where doctors confirmed that she was pregnant.

The girl lodged a complaint with GRP Mettupalayam, who registered a case under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act, 2012 and arrested Jayakumar, Rangaraj, Jebaraj, Malarvizhi and Manikandan two days ago. They were remanded in judicial custody and lodged in the Coimbatore Central Prison .

Police are on the lookout for two Medavakkam-based youths in connection with the case, GRP deputy superintendent A Annadurai said. The case will be transferred to the respective police station soon.

TimesView An upward fare revision will not just be unfair to passengers, but will also make state transport undertakings less attractive. The whole of Metro Phase 2 will be operational only by 2024 and a dedicated suburban rail project is still way off the track. As such, a robust bus transport is the most feasible option to save Bengaluru’s choking roads. Instead of hiking rates, the government should work out other ways to support the fragile STUs. It could even pick a lesson or two from other states dealing with similar concerns. Setting eyes on profit is fine, but not at the cost of losing patronage, which is already shrinking.

How it works in other states

BENGALURU: Fares of state transport undertakings — BMTC, KSRTC , NWKRTC and NEKRTC — are likely to be hiked to stem losses from rising operational costs. Confirming that discussions along similar lines were on, a senior transport department official said: “Fare revision is inevitable, but we haven’t yet decided if it will be applicable to all corporations or if BMTC will be exempted from it. It’s a policy decision to revise fares.”The proposal, which comes close on the heels of Bengaluru earning the tag of ‘the most traffic congested city in the world’, is likely to further discourage public transport users and add to congestion on roads. In November last year, chief minister BS Yediyurappa said the government would reduce bus fares of STUs to encourage people to use public transport. However, the CM recently backtracked on the promise. Transport minister Laxman Savadi too recently said that there is a ‘demand’ to increase fares.With skyrocketing operational costs, all STUs are incurring heavy losses. Statistics show that at Rs 349.4 crore, BMTC suffered maximum financial loss in 2018-19, followed by KSRTC (Rs 134.9 crore), NWKRTC (Rs 89 crore) and NEKRTC (Rs 68.2 crore).A fare increase between 10%-18% has been proposed, said sources.With state budget round the corner, all four STUs are hoping for a significant allocation to stem losses. According to sources, all STUs had suggested viability gap funding (which supports projects that are economically justified, but not financially viable) from the state government to enhance existing fleet and also expand the same. Currently, STUs are spending about 50% of their outlay on staff wages and 30% on fuel costs. In fact, many of them have already trimmed several schedules to reduce losses.“The government had exempted only BMTC from paying motor vehicles tax, but it still has to pay property tax and GST. We are hoping for a significant allocation for STUs in the budget,” said an official.Despite spiralling fuel costs, fares of STUs haven’t been revised since 2014. However, STUs in Karnataka still have one of the highest fares in the country. BMTC’s daily ridership has fallen to 35.8 lakh in 2018-2019 from 51.3 lakh in 2014-15. While a hike of 18% was announced in September 2018, it was reversed by then chief minister HD Kumaraswamy in less than 30 minutes due to public backlash.Many public transport activists say the move to hike rates could be detrimental as it’ll only increase traffic snarls in the city. “Bengaluru has the highest bus fares in the country.

Hyderabad: City-based life sciences player Biological E Limited on Monday inaugurated its manufacturing unit spread across 29 acres at Genome Valley in Hyderabad. The plant has been set up with an investment of Rs 300 crore. “This new facility will help our existing vaccines plant enhance the production and manufacture new products which are in the pipeline,’’ managing director Mahima Datla said and added that the facility would generate around 1,000 jobs.

The company also unveiled its new Typhoid Conjugate Vaccine (TCV), an injectable single-dose vaccine to be administered to children who are 6-month old and above as well as adults. The vaccine was developed in partnership with the GSK Vaccines Institute for Global Health, based in Italy’s Siena, which first developed the asset and transferred it to Biological E in 2013.

Subsequent developmental work on TCV was done by the company, including manufacturing process optimisation and scale up, pre-clinical studies and full clinical trials in India, the company said. It will be manufactured in the company’s manufacturing facilities in Hyderabad and is expected to be commercially available within three months.

Biological E has received approval from the Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation (CDSCO) to sell vaccine in India and has also submitted the vaccine for WHO pre-qualification (PQ) and registration in other countries.

Inaugurating the unit, Telangana industries and IT minister KT Rama Rao said: “We already produce one-third of the global vaccine requirement. We would like to strengthen our capabilities further and consolidate our position as the disease prevention capital of the world.”

Visakhapatnam: Police are taking tough measures against history-sheeters in north Andhra Pradesh, especially in Visakhapatnam, Vizianagaram and Srikakulam districts.

The number of history-sheeters in north Andhra has increased to 5,357 in 2020 with Vizag city limits having the highest--1,187-- followed by Vizianagaram district (1,413), Srikakulam district (1,113) and Vizag Rural (944).

A Trinad Rao, assistant commissioner of police (Task Force, Vizag city), said they are keenly monitoring history-sheeters in their limits. “We have been using resources and data from various wings of police department to keep a tab on active rowdy-sheeters in the city to ensure peace,” he said.

Leaders of the Left parties, including B Lokanatham of CPI(M) said rowdy-sheeters with the support of a few political leaders may indulge in criminal activities in Vizag and Vizianagaram region, where real estate business has picked up following the announcement of the executive capital.

Since majority of the rowdy-sheeters are backed by political leaders, the police have to register cases against their supporters, said Lokanadham.

“Our top priority is to safeguard the city’s image. Apart from counselling the rowdy-sheeters, we will cut down their revenue sources by cracking down on illegal activities,” said a senior police officer.

The injured head constable in hospital

BENGALURU: A 26-year-old head constable sustained serious injuries after Sandalwood star Darshan’s fans pelted stones and assaulted him while he was on security duty near the actor’s RR Nagar residence on Sunday night.

The fans were celebrating Darshan’s birthday in front of his house. As more than 4,000 people had gathered, about 750 police personnel were deputed there. The injured cop, Devaraj DR, is attached to Jnanabharathi police station.

According to RR Nagar police, cops resorted to mild lathicharge to control the crowd around 12.30am. Devaraj was hit by stones and assaulted. He sustained injuries in his right eye and nose and was shifted to a nearby hospital, where he underwent a surgery on Monday.

RR Nagar police have booked a case against Darshan’s fans and those who organised the birthday celebrations under IPC sections 353 (assault on duty official) and 332 (voluntarily causing hurt to deter public servant from duty). No arrests have been made.

Devaraj is admitted to SSNMC Super Specialty Hospital, RR Nagar, and neither Darshan nor anyone from his fans’ associations have turned up to see him, said a police source.

A neighbour of Darshan also filed a complaint against the fans after they vandalised his Swift Dzire. Residents in the vicinity said the nuisance had become an annual feature. “Though we can’t sleep through the night, we don’t blame fans for coming to their idol’s house on his birthday. But what’s worrying is that every time they vandalise things in the name of celebrations,” said a neighbour who didn’t wish to be named.

A retired employee said, “If police can’t handle the situation, why do they give permission to the actor’s fans to assemble? Some of them, who are drunk, climb compound walls and create nuisance. It is impossible to tell them anything.”

Darshan did not respond to messages and calls from TOI.

An aerial view of Chilavannur backwaters

KOCHI: The walkway and cycle path project ( Padmasarovaram ) of Kochi corporation figures in the list of Coastal Regulation Zone (CRZ) violations along Chilavannoor backwaters. Still, the authorities are reluctant to demolish the bund constructed to develop the walkway.

Last month, Kerala Coastal Zone Management Authority (KCZMA) had denied approval for Padamasarovaram project, which envisages construction of a cycle track and walkway across Chilavannoor backwaters connecting Subhash Chandra Bose Road and Sahodaran Ayyappan Road. While denying the approval, KCZMA had made it clear that the construction will obstruct the flow of tidal-influenced waterbody in the flood-prone area. Moreover, vigilance court, Muvattupuzha, has ordered a probe into the allegations that there were financial and other misappropriations pertaining to the project. It was based on a complaint by RTI activist K T Cheshire that the court ordered a probe regarding the allegations that those including additional chief secretary T K Jose and mayor Soumini Jain erred.

Kochi Metro Rail Ltd (KMRL) started the work on Padmasarovaram (now Sarovaram) project in December 2018 on behalf of the corporation. The work on the Rs 9.5-crore project was started without even submitting application for getting CRZ clearance. Later, KCZMA denied nod after it found that the project will obstruct the flow of tidal-influenced waterbody.

Chilavannoor backwaters fall under CRZ-I area, where constructions cannot be allowed. The project is being funded by Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation (Amrut). As per norms, Amrut funds should not be used for any projects which cause damage to the environment.

Hyderabad: The Telangana government is targeting doubling the size of the state’s life sciences industry to $100 billion this decade, state IT and industries minister KT Rama Rao said here on Monday. “With more than 800 pharma, biotech and medical technology companies, Telangana’s lifesciences sector already has a combined enterprise value of $50 billion…We have a vision to grow this to $100 billion and create four lakh new jobs in this decade,” he said at the inauguration of the BioAsia 2020 .

Biotech giant Biocon Ltd’s CMD Kiran Mazumdar Shaw too said Hyderabad has the potential to make it big in this sector. “Hyderabad has what it takes to be a world-class bio-cluster and now, all you need is to go beyond life sciences institutes…Today, I think the emergence and convergence of technology has led to data science and computational science becoming important part of life tech. I think, Hyderabad has been fortunate to have all of these elements that go to make a great biotech ecosystem,” she said.

KTR, meanwhile, said the state government will be developing the requisite infrastructure and creating a network of stakeholders and skilled workforce to achieve this goal. “One of the key steps we have taken as part of our GRID strategy is to expand Genome Valley, which is among Asia’s largest life sciences clusters. Genome Valley 2.0 masterplan has been prepared and we are looking at improving social infrastructure around the cluster,” he added.

He pointed out Hyderabad contributes over 35% to India’s pharma production and manufactures over 2 billion doses of vaccines every year, accounting for one-third of the global vaccine output.

He also said the 276-acre Medical Devices Park, the country’s largest, has attracted over 20 companies in the last two years.

On the upcoming Pharma City, he said the planning work is complete and environmental clearances are in place. “GoI also has recognized the potential of Pharma City by according the status of National Investment and Manufacturing Zone. We are very close to land allotments to industries,” he added.

Picture used for representational purpose only

AHMEDABAD: City police, which will provide outer security cover for US President Donald Trump’s visit on February 24, will take over all vacant houses in Motera, Vadaj and Sardarnagar areas to ensure no such house is used for any criminal activity.

Besides taking over around 40 vacant houses, the city police will also take over an under-construction four-storey building near the gate No. 1 of Motera stadium where US President Donald Trump and Prime Minister Narendra Modi will be present for the Namaste Trump event.

“We have been identifying vacant houses in the area and so far we have identified around 40 such houses. At least five police personnel will be deployed at each house to ensure criminal’s can’t use them,” said a police official deployed at the Motera cricket stadium.

Apart from this, police have started round the clock patrolling in Motera causing some inconvenience for local residents.

A resident of Motera said that cops are frequently visiting their housing society and checking identity proofs. “Now we always have to carry our identity proofs with us because of random checks by police. They, barge into our society any time and start inquiries,” said the Motera resident.

When asked, a police official said they will continue checking people in these areas to avoid any security lapse until the US president’s visit is over.

The group comes together on weekends for their project

HYDERABAD: Bus stops in Miyapur are getting a facelift by the Parivarthan Team. The group which presently consists of around 20 people, has been cleaning up defaced bus shelters for over a month now. So far, they have worked on six bus stops with work on three more stops on their immediate to-do list.

“The effort costs a mere Rs 1,500 for which we raise the amount by ourselves,” says Vinay Vangala, an employee with a private firm, who started the initiative. “We clean up the entire premises. This includes removing flexis and posters stuck to the shelters,” Vangala said and added the work is more about commitment than the money.

As part of their efforts, team members scrape off flexis and posters from top to bottom and give it a fresh coat of paint. The group comes together on weekends for their project. “We continue to monitor if the bus stops remain clean and that there are no fresh items stuck to them,” said team member Srinivas Bellam who works as a facility manager centre. “It is not a one-time job,” he says.

According to Bellam, mere words were not enough if they are not followed by action. “We did not want to just speak out on social media, but wanted to actually make a difference on ground,” he said. Another volunteer, Nanda Kishore, an entrepreneur by trade said that the idea germinated from the need to “fix issues ourselves” instead of simply complaining.

“We wanted to support the GHMC as we understand that officials too have their own set of problems,” Kishore said. From the time they have started their work, more people have approached the group asking for help for clean-ups in their area as well.

Crediting the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC), Vinay Vangala said that the team’s efforts have been helped in an instrumental way by the civic body, which lends some its staff for the clean-up work. ““We hope that we can create more awareness that public property belongs to us, and as custodians we need to take care of it,” Vangala says.

The group plans to make their way towards Madinaguda and Patancheru in the coming months. Volunteers said they would also train others so that more volunteer groups become active across the city.

315,['18/02/2020'],Baby steps towards a new waste plant,"This story is from February 18, 2020

New Delhi: Having taken over possession of 42.5 acres of land in Ghonda Gujran from Delhi Development Authority in December, East Delhi Municipal Corporation has finally initiated the exercise of setting up an integrated waste-processing facility there.

A senior EDMC official said National Thermal Power Corporation Limited had started the tendering process for setting up a waste-to-energy plant at the location. Soon, a similar exercise for a bio-methanation plant will start.

“We formed a joint venture with NTPC to implement the project last year. Thereafter, several rounds of meetings were held to decide the future course of action. The project includes setting up of a WTE plant, a bio-methanation plant, an aerobic composter and a small construction and demolition waste plant. The project will consume 2000 tonne of waste every day,” an EDMC official said.

The civic agency expects to start work on the site in another six months after securing the environmental go-ahead. The tentative deadline for the project is December 2021.

Officials say just like Ghazipur WTE, which handles 1,300 metric tonnes of garbage that comes in daily, the new plant will also handle fresh waste. “The facility will be of global standards and odourless, so that locals are not hassled. There will be no unprocessed waste left there,” the official quoted above said.

EDMC generates 2,800 tonnes of waste daily. Of this, around 1,300 tonnes go to the oversaturated Ghazipur landfill. The civic agency has been demanding an alternative site from DDA for a long time. After two people were killed in Ghazipur when a portion of the landfill collapsed in September 2017, the hunt for a new site gained fresh urgency. DDA agreed to hand over land at Ghonda Gujran along with another site at Sonia Vihar.

After objections from environmentalists stalled the move, National Green Tribunal finally approved the handover of the two sites in May last year. Officials said these won’t be traditional dumping sites and, as such, there was no question of harm to the floodplain, as feared by the activists.

After the Ghonda Gujran site was inundated in the monsoon season, DDA decided to carry out a survey before approving the allotment of land to EDMC. An EDMC official said all such issues had now been sorted out and work would start soon at the site.

File photo of Chennai metro

COIMBATORE: Chennai Metro Rail Limited (CMRL), which conducted a feasibility study for the Coimbatore metro rail project, has decided to create a fifth corridor to connect Vellalore and Ukkadam . It has also identified two places, at Press Colony near Periyanaickenpalayam and Chinniyampalayam, to station the trains.

CMRL had selected engineering and consulting firm Systra to conduct feasibility study for implementing the project in the city. The feasibility report suggested four corridors. The first corridor would be 26-kilometre long between Ukkadam and Kaniyur. The second would cover 24 kilometres between Ukkadam and Bilichi near Karamadai on the Mettupalayam Road. The third corridor will cover 42 kilometres between Thanneerpandal on Thadagam Road and Karanampettai on Trichy Road and the fourth will cover 44 kilometres between Karunya Nagar and Ganeshapuram.

Now, CMRL has decided to create a fifth corridor, which will be 11 kilometres long, to connect the integrated bus stand to be constructed at Vellalore at an estimated cost of 178.26 crore, to Ukkadam. “After shifting the bus stand to Vellalore, metro train service from Vellalore to Ukkadam would help commuters reach the city easily,” an official said.

CMRL has identified a plot at Press Colony that belongs to the Union government to station metro trains, apart from a place at Chinniyampalayam. “After getting financial sanction for land acquisition, the revenue department will help CMRL acquire the lands to station the trains,” the official added.

The private firm had submitted details of the development work to be implemented in the city for the metro project to the district administration and the city corporation last November.

Kozhikode: Kozhikode district panchayat is planning to explore the scenic beauty of rivers in the district . A special project combining river tourism and rural tourism will be prepared to attract foreign and domestic tourists to the riverbanks of Kozhikode.

The project will cover Chaliyar and Iruvanhi river in the first phase. The initiative aims to give employment opportunities to large number of people living on the banks of the two rivers.

“We held a seminar to get ideas and suggestions for the preparation of the river-rural tourism project,” said district panchayat president Babu Parassery. “Our plan is to implement the project with the support of individuals, cooperative firms and local bodies,” he said.

In the initial phase, a set of houses situated on the riverbanks will be identified for introducing home stays or paying guest facilities for tourists. All houses having the facility to accommodate tourists can join the venture.

River tourism is remaining unexplored in Kozhikode despite the presence of many major and minor rivers with scenic viewpoints. The district panchayat is trying to identify more scenic spots and introduce basic amenities for tourists with the support of local residents.

Employment for rural youth is also a major focus, said the district panchayat president. The district panchayat is also joining hands with Responsible Tourism Mission to train the local residents to start tourism-oriented enterprises. Under the river tourism project, the district panchayat is also planning to cooperate with the sand miners. Large number of people, mostly youths, used to engage in sand mining from Chaliyar, Iruvanhi and other rivers in the district. As sand mining is banned at many rivers and the youths have no job, the plan is to provide them job opportunity under the tourism project. Sand miners who are willing to operate the country boats to take tourists for water cruise can join the tourism project.

The river tourism project also aims to ensure protection of rivers. The problems faced by rivers, post flood condition of the rivers and river protection from flood will also be studied before the introduction of the project, the district panchayat president said. TNN

TIRUPATI: The pedestrian route leading to Tirumala through Srivari Mettu was sealed off by the vigilance and security department of Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams after the carcass of a stag was found in the middle of the pedestrian route on Monday evening.

TTD’s vigilance and security wing sleuths, who inspected the spot, suspect that a leopard on the prowl could have killed the stag and left behind the carcass after spotting the movement of devotees along the route.

The sleuths confirmed that the carcass of a wild stag was found near the 250th step leading to Tirumala along the Srivari mettu pedestrian route on Monday evening.

Pilgrims trekking along the pedestrian route, who first spotted the carcass of the wild stag, had told TTD’s vigilance wing that they had heard a loud growl emanating from the nearby forest area, following which the vigilance wing sleuths reached the spot and decided to seal off the Srivari mettu pedestrian route till 7 am on Tuesday morning.

TTD’s forest department staff were also roped in to confirm whether the wild stag was killed by a leopard or by a group of wild dogs, which are commonly spotted in the nearby forests here.

GUWAHATI: Bengali Hindu brides and grooms in Assam choosing Assamese Hindu partners could receive around Rs 40,000 each as financial assistance under a scheme proposed by the state Linguistic Minority Development Board “to strengthen the bond between the two communities”.

“Couples in inter-community marriages are often deprived of property rights, besides facing a social boycott. We intend to assist such couples in setting up shops, beauty salons and also in farming,” Board chairman Alok Kumar Ghose said. “The proposal was submitted to the state government two days ago.” A website is already being designed for Bengali-Assamese Hindu couples to register their details online.

While Ghose claimed the initiative would foster amity, the All Assam Minority Students’ Union termed the proposal “divisive” and accused the board of attempting religious polarisation. “The government has been taking steps to create divisions between Hindus and Muslims. The board’s proposal is just another example of this. Rather than providing assistance along religious lines, the board could have extended help to any financially unstable Bengali person marrying into any religion or community,” said Rejaul Karim Sarkar , president of the student union.

All Assam Bengali Youth Students’ Federation president Samrat Bhowal said his organisation would back any initiative to remove “mistrust” between the Bengalis and Assamese. “There have been some incidents of late that have created mistrust between the two communities. This (the offer of financial assistance to inter-community Hindu couples) is a timely approach and we welcome it.”

Visakhapatnam: The Visakhapatnam district administration has developed a proposal to launch organic rythu bazaars on an experimental basis in the city.

The city has at present two organic hotels and demand for organic food items is on the rise.

Discussions are at present underway with stakeholders, including organic vegetable farmers, millet farmers and other producers. The department of civil supplies and marketing plans to introduce the bazaars this summer. Based on the public’s reception to the initiative, organic rythu bazaars may also be introduced in Vijayawada, Tirupati, Kakinada and Rajamundry.

Speaking to TOI, Visakhapatnam joint collector L Shiva Shankar said that initially, two of the 13 rythu bazaars in the city will sell organic vegetables. The bazaars at Seethammadhara and MVP Colony have been selected, in view of the large number of customers they draw.

“We are still negotiating with the stakeholders. I will be able to confirm this project within the next week. We plan to hold these bazaars once every week, every Tuesday at Seethammadhara and every Saturday at MVP Colony,” the joint collector said.

J Kumara Swamy, founder-member of the Andhra Pradesh Organic Farmers’ Welfare Association said that they have requested the government to not include in the proposal persons with political affiliations. He added that they have requested that only genuine organic farmers be allowed to sell produce and to ensure that other districts also adopt the concept of organic rythu bazaars.

On the feasibility of organic rythu bazaars, Kumara Swamy said the district tops in organic farming in the state, with nearly 15 per cent of land devoted to the organic farming of various crops, such as paddy, millets and vegetables.

An official with the agriculture department said mandals such as Chodavaram, Anandapuram, Padmanabha and Payakaraopeta have a high proportion of land under organic farming.

“Farming in some villages is completely organic as farmers have adopted Zero Budget Natural Farming (ZBNF) method,” said JV Ratnam, an environmentalist.

Mujeeb says that what followed left him unable to go out of his house for two months.

It was only due to exams that Mujeeb ventured out of his house and reached the Jamia campus on Monday. He is among the six students who have filed a petition in Delhi high court seeking monetary compensation for the “physical pain and mental trauma” they suffered when police swarmed the Jamia Millia Islamia campus in pursuit of anti-Citizenship Amendment Act protest that day.

The 21-year-old from Amroha, Uttar Pradesh, is undergoing treatment at Jaypee Hospital in Noida, His father, a government official, said, “He has two rods in his legs and will need many more months before he can walk.” The youngster says that “my plans to undertake a master’s degree course have been derailed” and has asked for a compensation of Rs 2 crore.

On December 15, Mujeeb recalled, “Policemen barged in and began beating us. Seven-eight of us hid around the lawns, but the policemen found us and thrashed us.” He was hit on his legs and fell to the ground, unable to move until some students helped him an hour later.

Mohammad Mustafa, who is pursuing a master’s degree in social exclusion and Inclusive policy, has demanded a compensation of Rs 1 crore. “I wanted to sit for the civil services exams this year, but I can’t because the cops injured both my hands. The metacarpal on my left hand yet to heal, ” he added.

The 26-year-old from Paschim Champaran in Bihar thought the cops wouldn’t resort to beating. In fact, when a cop shouted “chahiye azadi?” he replied, “Nahi, sarkari naukri chahiye.” But he was thrashed “like a criminal”, though he claimed he wasn’t a protest participant.

JAIPUR: A day after the Anti-Corruption Bureau (ACB) busted a bribery nexus between a few transport department officials and agents, sleuths said they had enough evidence against the 15 arrested. The accused were presented before the ACB court on Monday.

Among the arrested are eight transport department officials and seven agents. The ACB had claimed that they had recovered Rs 1.5 crore from their possession. Few months ago, transport company owners had filed complaint against some transport officials who threatened to cancel their registrations and allegedly demanded bribes through their agents.

“Seizure of money from their possessions is one aspect, but we have got a lot of other evidence against the arrested. They were involved in threatening the owners of vehicles and transporters,” said Dinesh MN, additional director general (ADG), ACB.

The ACB had to arrange a bus for the transportation of accused from its office to its court. It is one of the biggest ever raids conducted by the bureau.

“They were on our radar for the past six months. We had been closely monitoring their activities for the past six months. We have documentary evidence against them,” he said.

He said two transport inspectors, Sukhveer Choudhary and Rajiv Jain, are still out of ACB net. “They have fled and we are searching for them,” he said.

On Monday, ACB sleuths continued their searches. ACB director general of police (DGP) Alok Tripathy said they broke the seal of Tanushree Logistics office and claimed to have found documents of exchange of bribery and seized Rs 16.9 lakh.

They have also searched SUV owned by one Sheojiram Gadwal, a resident of Dudu, who has fled. They found records of exchange of money.

“Six special teams are working round-the-clock to crack the case. We hope to solve it within two days,” said a police officer. “The teams collected some surveillance footage and also verified registration plates of some motorcycles.

A three-member gang had stabbed D Tamilselvan, 20, of Nadu Arasur to death when he refused to hand over his mobile phone on Saturday night. He was a third year Mechanical Engineering student in a private college.

Ten minutes later, the same gang snatched the phone of 25-year-old K Mahalingam of Arasur and stabbed him using a knife. They escaped in his motorcycle. They abandoned the two-wheeler a kilometre away from the crime scene, after Mahalingam, with the help of a motorist, chased them.

Illustration used for representational purpose.

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Following the decision to link details of land holders with their respective Aadhaar numbers, the government is also likely to take a favourable decision on the proposal by the registration department to make it mandatory to submit Aadhaar number of buyers and sellers of properties during property registrations .

A proposal in this regard from IG, registrations, on the basis of recommendations from the Centre, (accessed by TOI) is pending before the government for more than a year now. The department of land resources under the ministry of rural development of the Centre, had written to the states in 2017, that Aadhaar authentication should be made mandatory for registration of properties for identification and prevention of benami property transactions.

As per directions from the Centre, every sub-registrar office should have provisions for readily enrolling citizens and provide them with Aadhaar number if they do not have one. Once the proposal comes into force, an applicant executing the registration of a deed will be required to provide the Aadhaar number along with other details. According to registration department sources, once approved by the government, all the registration under an Aadhaar number can be easily tracked from any office. Also, since the process of integration of the registration department with the revenue department is underway, the Aadhaar details will be readily available in the village records once the property registration is completed.

Even before the Centre asked the states to use Aadhaar for property registration, the state revenue department had in 2012 come up with the idea of unique thandaper number (UTN), a unique 10-digit alphanumeric number. The first two digits would be alphabets that would capture the details like district, taluk and village and the remaining eight digits would be the unique thandaper assigned to each land holder in the state. However, the UDF government did not proceed with the idea.

“Now that a policy decision has been taken, the government is likely to give clearance for the proposal of the registrations department as well. This decision to link land details with Aadhaar is the best in terms of implementing the Kerala Land Reforms Act in its true letter and spirit,” a senior government officials said.

At present, individuals are allowed to hold a maximum of 7.5 acres and families a maximum of 15 acres. Since there is no single number linking all transactions, it is impossible to know how much land an individual or a family is holding in various parts of the state. Once Aadhaar is linked, the land held under a single Aadhaar number can easily be detected.

Visakhapatnam: The historic and picturesque district of Vizianagaram has the potential to become the state’s tourist hot spot. Despite being known for its beautiful reservoirs, picnic spots and historic locales, the district has failed to make the best use of its tourism potential, and the reasons are varied.

One of the main reasons is lack of organised tourist infrastructure. There has been little or no promotion of its locales, road infrastructure is inadequate in tourist places, nor are there enough good places for the tourists to stay. Things, however, might be changing for the better. Tourism department officials say though a lot of ground work was done in the last five years to identify places with tourism potential, project grounding was never done. Now, the government is reviewing the tourism policy, and it might signal good tidings for the district.

PNV Lakshmi Narayana, tourism and culture officer for Vizianagaram district, said 20 tourist destinations have been identified to be developed in the district. “Among those are the three reservoir hot spots — Gosthani, Thatipudi and Thotapalli — which have been earmarked for reservoir tourism projects. The other attractions include Kumili village, Mukam estuary, Chintapalli beach and other places of historical relevance such as the old Bobbili mud fort, which witnessed the battle of Bobbili fought in the mid-18th century involving the French led by Bussy,” Lakshmi Narayana said.

“Initially, we did introduce boat services for tourists in Thotapalli and Thatipudi, and plans were also drawn to make Thatipudi a water sports and adventure enclave, but the funds were not adequate. Now, with the government reviewing the tourism policy, we are planning to give Vizianagaram its due prominence on the state’s tourist map,” the tourism officer added.

Vizianagaram’s potential for tourism can be gauged by looking at the numbers. The footfall for last year was 58 lakh, out of which over 2,000 were foreigners. Most tourists visited Pydithalamma, Govindapuram and Punyagiri temples, besides Thatipudi reservoir and Vizanagaram fort. The numbers can only go up now.

Bareilly: At least two people died in Nagala Chaturbhanpur village under Dhanari police station limits of Sambhal district after consuming liquor at a wedding feast on the intervening night of Sunday and Monday.

The feast had been thrown by village resident Kalyan Singh on the occasion of his daughter’s wedding. Eyewitnesses said the two people started vomiting while guests were enjoying dinner. They were rushed to the hospital, where doctors declared they were “brought dead”.

SP Yamuna Prasad quashed rumours that the liquor was poisonous, saying, “It doesn’t seem the liquor was poisonous, as other guests had also consumed the same alcohol at the party. The bodies have been sent for autopsy. The matter is being investigated.”

According to police, Kalyan Singh has said he didn’t serve any liquor at the feast, that the two victims — Tauki Singh (45) of neighbouring Saimla village and his cousin Urman (46) — must have brought the liquor with them, or bought and consumed it before arriving at his home.

“Upon arriving, Tauki and Urman went to have dinner, after which they suddenly started vomiting. Some of my relatives took them to hospital, where they were declared brought dead,” Singh said.

The Nagala Chaturbhanpur village head and other locals claimed they died from consuming hooch. Police have recovered an empty liquor bottle from the site.

On being informed, the DM also reached the spot to take stock. He said, “During interrogation, it was learnt that both deceased had consumed branded liquor manufactured by Mansurpur distillery in Shamli. Some other guests had also consumed the same liquor before arriving for the function and eating dinner. The cause of death will be clear once the post-mortem reports arrive. Meanwhile, probe is underway.”

He added that excise department has been instructed to carry out an intensive drive to eradicate sale of hooch in the area.

Illustration used for representational purpose.

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Following the decision to link details of land holders with their respective Aadhaar numbers, the government is also likely to take a favourable decision on the proposal by the registration department to make it mandatory to submit Aadhaar number of buyers and sellers of properties during property registrations .

A proposal in this regard from IG, registrations, on the basis of recommendations from the Centre, (accessed by TOI) is pending before the government for more than a year now. The department of land resources under the ministry of rural development of the Centre, had written to the states in 2017, that Aadhaar authentication should be made mandatory for registration of properties for identification and prevention of benami property transactions.

As per directions from the Centre, every sub-registrar office should have provisions for readily enrolling citizens and provide them with Aadhaar number if they do not have one. Once the proposal comes into force, an applicant executing the registration of a deed will be required to provide the Aadhaar number along with other details. According to registration department sources, once approved by the government, all the registration under an Aadhaar number can be easily tracked from any office. Also, since the process of integration of the registration department with the revenue department is underway, the Aadhaar details will be readily available in the village records once the property registration is completed.

Even before the Centre asked the states to use Aadhaar for property registration, the state revenue department had in 2012 come up with the idea of unique thandaper number (UTN), a unique 10-digit alphanumeric number. The first two digits would be alphabets that would capture the details like district, taluk and village and the remaining eight digits would be the unique thandaper assigned to each land holder in the state. However, the UDF government did not proceed with the idea.

“Now that a policy decision has been taken, the government is likely to give clearance for the proposal of the registrations department as well. This decision to link land details with Aadhaar is the best in terms of implementing the Kerala Land Reforms Act in its true letter and spirit,” a senior government officials said.

At present, individuals are allowed to hold a maximum of 7.5 acres and families a maximum of 15 acres. Since there is no single number linking all transactions, it is impossible to know how much land an individual or a family is holding in various parts of the state. Once Aadhaar is linked, the land held under a single Aadhaar number can easily be detected.

Enforcement Department seizes cash & gold worth Rs 15 crore

JAIPUR: The Enforcement Department’s zonal office (Jaipur) on Monday seized foreign and Indian currency worth Rs 3.75 crore and over 39 kg of gold and silver in raids in multiple cities against jewellers associated with an alleged gold-smuggling hawala racket. The total seizure was worth nearly Rs 15 crore.

The raids were conducted in Jaipur, Kolkata and Chennai under the provisions of the Foreign Exchange Management Act (FEMA) with the ED claiming that the action has led to detection of “huge evasion” of customs duty, GST and income tax.

“Searches at various premises in Jaipur, Kolkata and Chennai resulted in seizure of unaccounted Indian and foreign currency worth Rs 3.75 crore, gold bar and jewellery weighing 26.97 kg and silver weighing 12.22 kg along with incriminating documents. Electronic and digital devices seized are still to be examined and may lead to further details of illegal dealings,” the ED said.

According to ED sources, sleuths got reliable inputs that M/s Maharaja Jewellers and its proprietor Tara Chand Soni, M/s Bhagwati Jewellers through its proprietor Ram Gopal Soni, Ladiwala Associates through its proprietor Honey Ladiwala of Jaipur were purchasing smuggled gold bars from one Harsh Bothra based in Chennai.

Acting on the information, it was found that various individuals were involved in smuggling of gold bars and subsequent dispatch of those to Jaipur. Gold bars were mainly arriving in Jaipur via Kolkata and had high purity level, the ED said.

The suspects used to remove the foreign mark of manufacturer or bank engraved or embossed on the gold bars and then smuggle those into the country, the ED said, adding those were then dispatched to various domestic markets by different modes of transportation to escape the scanner of enforcement agencies.

The accused jewellers did not account for jewellery manufactured from smuggled gold and the illegal funds generated were then transferred through hawala agents based in these cities, the probe agency said.

Electronic and digital devices seized were yet to be examined and may lead to further details of illegal dealings.

New Delhi: East Delhi MP Gautam Gambhir inspected the Ghazipur landfill along with senior officials on Tuesday and held a review meeting about its condition. It was decided that talks would be initiated with all ministries concerned on a priority basis to find the best possible solutions to accelerate the pace of treating legacy waste left by a trommel machine after segregating waste.

The participants also focused on pursuing the National Highway Authority of India (NHAI) afresh to utilise the soil left even after processing legacy waste in road filling.

In September 2019, EDMC started segregating and processing the waste at Ghazipur landfill by using a trommel-cum-ballistic machine, which is basically a gigantic cylindrical sieve that sorts the waste into detritus of different sizes and types for suitable treatment. The machine segregates 640 metric tonnes of waste daily, which is bringing down the height of the garbage dump at Ghazipur.

“Getting the height of the landfill down is my biggest priority and I will take every possible step for it,” Gambhir said. East Delhi Municipal Corporation commissioner Dilraj Kaur, mayor Anju Kamalkant and the joint secretary of Swachh Bharat Mission under the Union housing and urban development ministry were present at the meeting.

In 2016, there were efforts to make NHAI use at least 65% of the then 13 million metric tonnes of garbage at the landfill in road embankments along the Delhi-Meerut Expressway. However, the project didn’t materialise. The hurdles included high cost to excavate and process the garbage.

NEW DELHI: Three new videos were released on Monday morning that appear to show not only police beating students at Jamia Millia Islamia on December 15, but also protesters apparently entering the campus and some students with brickbats in their hands. Student group Jamia Coordination Committee alleged on Monday that Delhi Police was leaking “vague videos to hide their actions”. Other students believed that if some had stones in their hands, it was to defend themselves against the thrashing and tear-gassing by the cops.

Members of Jamia Coordination Committee clarified that they did not have any videos of the anti-Citizenship Amendment Act protests of December 15 in their possession. “The manner in which these videos are being leaked... there appears to be a bid to paint Jamia students as culprits,” observed Safoora Zargar, JCC member.

The Jamia Millia administration, which has distanced itself from the videos that came online from 1am on Monday, has reiterated that it did not leak the recordings. Waseem Ahmed Khan, proctor of the varsity, said, “We are not sure who is leaking the videos; it is the job of the police to find out.” Khan also expressed doubts about the authenticity of the videos in circulation and said that they required to be investigated.

The videos corroborate the sequence of the police action in Jamia. Tanjil Ahmed Choudhury, a final year BEd student and one of the injured trio highlighted in graffiti near the university stadium walls, recalled being at the campus gates around 5.30pm that day when he hear the crack of bursting teargas shells. “When we saw smoke billowing, I and a senior student decided to stay put because we had heard of the violence near the Mata Ki Mandir at southeast Delhi’s New Friends Colony. We thought the police officers would not enter the university campus,” said Choudhury. “But policemen rushed in and began beating the students. As I ran towards the central canteen, I saw teargas shells being lobbed at us. The panicky students ran to the new and the old library buildings nearby.”

A student confirmed that some people had picked up stones and bricks. “The students felt that they had to defend themselves against the policemen,” he asserted.

The videos, which have the watermark of student-run news organisation, show police entering through the library door on the ground floor, making the students there near the gate before raining blows on them. They can also be seen breaking the CCTV cameras. Among the many students affected, Shayaan Mujeeb, 21, was hit on his legs and is still undergoing treatment.

Mohammad Mustafa and Mohammad Minhajuddin, the other two names invoked in the Jamia graffiti, too heard the commotion. “There were many students running up from the ground floor and screaming that police were attacking them. To cope with the teargas, many had tied handkerchiefs around their faces,” remembered Mustafa. The masters student had both his arms fractured and even got his laptop damaged during the melee. Minhajuddin, who lost vision in one eye, offered similar details of the incident.

PIMPRI CHINCHWAD: Taxes for old properties in Pimpri Chinchwad assessed in 2006-07 may increase by up to 2.5 times if the civic administration has its way.The property tax department of the Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC) has proposed rationalization of the taxes of these properties. It claimed that the move would fetch an additional revenue of Rs100-Rs150 crore in the 2020-21 financial year.“There will be no change in the taxes on the new properties,” municipal commissioner Shravan Hardikar told TOI after presenting the draft budget of 2020-21 with an outlay Rs6,627.99 crore and revised budget of 2019-20 with a Rs 6,187-crore outlay to PCMC standing committee chairperson Vilas Madigeri on Monday.Though the draft budget has not proposed any increase in the property tax rates, the civic body is eyeing a tax rationalization to reduce the difference in the taxes of the old and new properties in an area.Hardikar said, “The rateable value of properties was frozen in some areas in 1996. The value was subsequently changed in a way that the old properties were not affected. This has created a massive gap between the taxes of the old and new properties in an area.”He added that the civic body would consider the depreciation of old properties while conducting rationalisation. “This will lead to an increase in the property tax of the old properties by 2-2.5 times. The municipal commissioner has powers to decide the rateable value of properties and there is no need to take the general body’s (GB) approval for it. Properties assessed before 2006-07 will be identified for rationalisation. These constitute 30-40% of the total properties in the city,” Hardikar said.Among the other major highlight of the draft budget proposals are the plan to raise Rs400 crore through bonds for environmental services and water supply projects. Hardikar said, “We will need around Rs600 crore in the next few years for implementing projects to have water security for the next 30 years. We want to implement projects to bring water from the Bhama Askhed and Andra dams. We also want to increase the pumping capacity of the Ravet pumping station.

The information was given by the state government facing a contempt notice in connecting to the petition challenging allotment of government bungalow to the former chief ministers and facilities given to them.

The previous Raje-government’s law on allowing free lifelong facilities to ex-CMs was struck down by HC and then upheld by the SC. “It is humbly submitted that Raje continues to occupy the Bungalow no 13 since she being entitled for it as a member of legislative assembly,” the reply filed in the court said.

The bench comprising Justice Sabina and Justice NS Dhadha has given April 20 as the next date of hearing.

NEW DELHI: The two criminals who were killed in an encounter with Special Cell near Pul Prahladpur on Monday had hatched a conspiracy to kill a politician in Ghaziabad . However, the politician got know about it and informed police after which the criminals put the plan on hold. A probe is on to find out who had paid them to carry out the murder.

The criminals, Raja Qureshi and Ramesh, were found involved in back-to-back robberies in north, northwest and northeast Delhi. Qureshi had been trying to establish supremacy in the areas to gain followers and create terror among businessmen. He had roped in Ramesh by promising him a share in the contract amount.

Teams led by ACPs Lalit Mohan Negi and Hriday Bhushan had been tracking the duo for the past few months. They found that to establish clout in the region, Qureshi had murdered his associates claiming that they had turned into police informers.

Last week, Qureshi had attacked two policemen at a builder’s office in Karawal Nagar and asked them whether police knew who he was. When one of the cops replied in the negative, he placed his pistol on his abdomen and opened fire.

A sensational robbery committed by the duo at a shop in Khajuri Khas was captured on CCTV. They carried out the crime by holding the shop owner and a customer at a gunpoint. They had also robbed a businessman at Ashok Vihar last month.

What is startling for police is the huge amount of firearms found with the duo. Police seized 69 rounds of different bores and three pistols from their bags. The role of Loni-based arms dealers is being probed.

343,['18/02/2020'],Madhya Pradesh: Oppose the propose tariff hike? MPERC seeks your suggestion,"Representative image

BHOPAL: After discoms submitted a petition before Madhya Pradesh Electricity Regulatory Commission (MPERC) seeking 5.28% tariff hike for domestic consumers against Rs 2000 crore losses for financial year 2020-21, the regulator has sought objections from the stakeholders over this demand by March 7. This hike has been sought to bridge the gap of around Rs2000 crore in the estimated figures of income and expenditure for financial year 2020-21.Power tariff is determined on the basis of projected consumption and sale of energy i.e., before the financial year for which the tariff hike is sought had actually started and true-up losses are actual revenue losses, which are filed by discoms after actual consumption and payments, i.e., after the end of the financial year for which ARR was filed. If the commission allows the ARR petition of the discoms, then the monthly energy bill of an average consumer — who uses two ACs, a couple of fans, an LED TV and five LED bulbs, or about 425 units per month will go up by at least Rs200 from Rs3600, which he/she is paying at current prices.It is noteworthy that prior to this, discoms had also sought a hike against true-up petitions for years 2014-15, 2015-16, 2016-17 and 2017-18, which amount to Rs25,000 crore and urged the MPERC to recover these losses from consumers by increasing the power tariff. And then additional hike was sought against losses of Rs 5000 crores incurred in the financial year 2018-19.Unlike ARR petitions which are based on the estimated income and losses, true-up petitions are based on the actual income and losses in the financial year and these are submitted after the tariff period is over, urging the commission to allow the discom to recover it through the petitions filed for seeking tariff hike in next financial year.After receiving the objections from stakeholders till March 7, MPERC will hold a public hearing in the matter to decide the petitions.",bhopal,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74184435,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-122239,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/mperc-seeks-objections-to-discoms-demand-for-tariff-hike/articleshow/74181481.cms

Representative image

PUNE: Four men were arrested late on Monday evening on the charge of bludgeoning a 45-year-old owner of an engineering workshop to death at Biradwadi in Khed taluka , about 35km from Pune, following a quarrel in the morning. Their three accomplices are at large.

The Chakan police identified the deceased as Harishchandra Kisan Dete of Bhairavnagar in Dhanori. “Dete was the owner of the VHD engineering workshop in Biradwadi. The main suspect, Jeevan Dongare , of Biradwadi and three others are in the police custody,” Ram Jadhav, assistant commissioner of police (Pimpri Chinchwad), said.

Jadhav said prima facie probe revealed that Dete’s murder was fallout of a quarrel, which happened in the morning on the premises of the workshop.

Senior inspector Kalyan Pawar of the Chakan police told TOI that for the past year, Dongare’s estranged wife had been working at Dete’s workshop. “Dongare, who had shifted to Mumbai, used to suspect the woman of infidelity,” he said.

Recently, Dongare moved to Biradwadi and started working as an autorickshaw driver. “Around 10am on Monday, he went to the workshop and started harassing his estranged wife when Dete intervened and reprimanded him,” Pawar said.

Around 3pm, Dongare returned to the workshop with his six accomplices and began abusing Dete. “When Dete came out of the workshop, all the suspects beat him brutally. Our probe has revealed that Dongare picked up a stone and bludgeoned Dete to death,” Pawar said.

The employees in the workshop rushed Dete to a nearby hospital, where he was pronounced dead by the doctors.

Pramod Kolhe, an engineer from the workshop, has lodged an FIR against the suspects. “We have launched a search for the remaining suspects involved in the murder,” Pawar said.

347,['18/02/2020'],Passengers escape with injuries after bus falls 15ft,"This story is from February 18, 2020

Nashik: Passengers onboard a state transport bus had a lucky escape on Monday after the vehicle fell 15 feet off the Peth-Dindori road in Chachadgaon, Dindori taluka, about 35 km from here.

Apart from the driver and the conductor, 12 passengers were travelling in the bus.

The injured were shifted to a nearby hospital for treatment. The Dindori police said all the passengers in the bus suffered minor to medium injuries. The accident happened sometime around 7.30 am.

“The bus was heading towards Dindori from Peth. At around 7.30 am, it went off the road after the driver lost control of the steering wheel because of a bad stretch of road near a bridge. It fell 15 feet and came to rest after turning turtle,” said Anil Borse, the inspector with the Dindori police station.

Personnel from a nearby police outpost were able to quickly respond to the incident and the 108 ambulance service was dispatched to take the injured to a nearby hospital.

“Two of the passengers were referred to the Nashik Civil Hospital as they had suffered slightly serious injuries,” Borse said.

He added that the bus driver lost control after the vehicle hit a broken stretch of road near a bridge. “The bridge was recently concretised. But there’s still a small crater on the concreted part of the road. The bus suffered a big jerk when it hit the crater. And the driver lost control,” he said.

Borse added that the police in the area have now written to authorities concerned to repair the road as soon as possible. “This could have ended in a tragedy. What if it was a school bus?” he asked.

355,['18/02/2020'],Vijayawada: Disquiet in Agency areas over violation of SC orders,"This story is from February 18, 2020

Supreme Court

VIJAYAWADA: The disquiet among the Adivasi community in the tribal regions of Visakhapatnam has been rising in recent months as the state government appears to be turning a blind eye to critical rulings by the courts, including the Supreme Court, on the rights of Adivasis to their land.

One important ruling on the rights of the Adivasis was given by the Supreme Court in July 1997. In its judgment filed in the lawsuit brought by Samata, a non-governmental organisation, the apex court declared null and void the transfer of land in the scheduled areas and also upheld the Forest Protection Act of 1980.

“The Supreme Court decision, which has since been called the Samata judgment, is by far the most progressive of rulings, but unfortunately its efficacy has been steadily diluted in AP and other states,” says Ravi Rebbapragada, who is the executive director of Samata, which had brought the lawsuit against the AP government. The Samata ruling had allocated 20% of the net profit to the local area development councils in the states, but somehow that order has been followed more in the breach than in practice, Rebbapragada claimed.

The AP government has also been tardy in enforcing laws pertaining to the Fifth Schedule of the Constitution, which governs the laws in Adivasi land. “While the AP government has not given any licence for mining of bauxite in the Agency areas of Visakhapatnam, it has allowed the mining of laterite, which is also illegal. More importantly, the government has been allowing plains people to illegally set up so-called tourism projects in Agency areas like Lambasingi, Paderu and Anantagiri,” Rebbapragada alleged.

“The Adivasis are even not paid minimum wages. They are treated like slaves by owners of guest houses and hotels and other attractions in these places,” Rebbapragada said.

Apart from over-exploiting the fragile ecology of the Agency areas, tourists have made a mess of the region with rampant littering. “Dallapalli has been almost drowned in single-use plastic bags and other litter, which has not been removed by the administration, making it clear that it wants to exploit the Agency areas at the expense of the Adivasis who have been living in the region for generations, eking a living out of the forests,” he added.

The alleged continuing onslaught on Adivasi rights has prompted them to get together to launch an agitation for the protection of the Fifth Schedule rights. The community held a massive show of strength in Paderu on February 12 which was attended by over one lakh people. A joint action committee of the Adivasis has also requested the AP government to resolve their issues at the earliest.

According to EAS Sarma, a former Union expenditure secretary, Adivasis’ land was being commandeered illegally by plains people on the pretext of setting up hotels in Anantagiri, Paderu and Lambasingi

JAIPUR: A day after ACB busted corruption racket at the transport department, the transport minister held a review meeting. He urged that no innocent officer should be harassed by the sleuths of the ACB and advocated for stern action against those involved in corrupt practices in his department.

Khachariyawas, in a meeting with various officers at the transport office, told the officers that the government is committed to zero-tolerance in corruption.

“There is panic among transport department employees. I have assured them that no innocent officers will be harassed by the ACB. But, we will take strict action against those responsible for the corrupt practice in the department,” said Khachariyawas while talking to TOI after the meeting.

He added that family members of various employees of the transport department approached him at his residence on Monday morning. “If ACB has a right to take action against any officer, the family members also have the right to speak. After getting feedback on ACB action, I will urge the authorities to ensure no innocent officer be unnecessarily dragged in the case,” Khachariyawas added.

According to sources, the transport minister has also spoken to chief minister Ashok Gehlot and urged him to ensure sleuths of ACB should not create panic among the employees in the name of investigation.

ACB on Sunday had arrested 15 people including brokers and officials of the transport department and claimed to have busted one of the biggest corruption rackets involved in extortion of transporters.

NEW DELHI: BJP on Monday accused Congress of “giving a political colour” to the violence at Jamia Millia Islamia on December 15, alleging that its functionaries always railed against security forces and stood with those who were inimical to the country.

BJP’s remarks came after Congress attacked the government over a new video showing police and paramilitary personnel caning students in the university’s library on December 15.

“Congress has continuously supports antisocial elements and those who indulge in violence. It raises voice against the security forces and police personnel of the country,” BJP spokesperson GVL Narasimha Rao said at a press conference.

Talking about another video in which people were seen in the gangway with some covering their faces, while at least two of them were carrying stones, Rao asked why the students were wearing masks and why they were studying with stones in their hands.

Rao highlighted the Supreme Court’s stand on December 16 while hearing cases pertaining to violence at Jamia and Aligarh Muslim University . The SC had said: “We will determine the students’ rights but not in the atmosphere of riots.”

AHMEDABAD: Crowd management is emerging as the biggest headache for organizers and security personnel at the Motera stadium on February 24. It is estimated that with 120 metal detector door frames and 250 handheld devices, it will take approximately 2.5 hours to 3 hours to complete security checks for 1.1 lakh people who will be entering the stadium.

A large chunk of the crowd is coming from nearby districts of Patan, Sabarkantha, Aravalli , Gandhinagar districts and outskirts of Ahmedabad. There is tremendous pressure on BJP party workers to gather numbers. Children as spectators will be avoided within the stadium, unless they are part of cultural performances said a senior AMC official.

“Spectators from outside Ahmedabad district will be given preferential treatment and will be taken inside the stadium first,” said a senior BJP leader in the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation (AMC).

Government officials including mamlatdars in the collectorate and assistant municipal commissioners have been given targets to bring spectators. “Each assistant municipal commissioner in every zone has been asked to gather at least 220 to 250 people for the roadshow by contracting NGOs and religious institutions. Incentives like banners of the NGO will be allowed to be put up along the VIP route,” said a senior AMC official. In all space for 2,300 buses and more than 6,000 cars have earmarked in 28 plots, most of which are private.

“People have happily given us their plots as the AMC is clearing their plots of debris and garbage, levelling them and watering them for parking purposes. It’s a win-win deal,” says the AMC official.

Anil Mittal (L), Sachin

NEW DELHI: At least seven people suffering from end-stage organ failure received a new lease of life on Monday, thanks to organ donation by the families of two individuals who were declared brain dead at AIIMS .

Sachin, a 26-year-old daily wage labourer from Kashganj in UP fell from second floor of a building and was brought to the AIIMS Trauma Centre last week.

On Saturday, he was declared brain dead. After counselling by the Organ Retrieval Banking Organisation (ORBO) at the institute, the grieving family members took the brave decision of multi-organ and tissue donation. “Sachin’s heart, liver, kidneys and corneas were donated,” said a senior official.

The second cadaver donor, Anil Mittal, had suffered from irreversible brain damage due to a haemorrhage. He was admitted to AIIMS on Saturday night. By Sunday, he had been declared brain dead. Mittal, 61, was a pledged donor with Dadhichi Deh Dan Samiti and his family fulfilled his wish of organ and tissue donation. An offical said Mittal’s heart, liver, kidneys, corneas and bones were donated. All the organs, except two kidneys, were used in AIIMS itself to save the life of patients suffering from organ failure. Two kidneys were sent to Ram Manohar Lohia (RML) hospital for transplantation,

The tissues and heart valve have been preserved for future use. Overall, more than 30 patients will benefit from the donations, the AIIMS official said.

Dr Randeep Guleria, director of AIIMS, lauded the contribution of the donor families and said that the families were gracious enough to take decision in the most painful moments of their lives.

“There are a lot of misconceptions and hurdles like non-acceptance of brain stem death, fear of disfigurement of the body, religious myths and divided family opinion that lead to lower rates of such donations in India as compared to developed nations. But we are hopeful of positive change,” Dr Aarti Vij, who is also in charge of ORBO, said.

BAREILLY: A 22-year-old youth who was on way to Bareilly from Kichcha in Uttarakhand to distribute invitation cards for his sister’s marriage died and his cousin was critically injured on Sunday night when their bike was hit by an unidentified vehicle on Nainital-Bareilly state highway near Atamanda village under Bhojipura police station.

Victim Akash Kumar was the only son among three children. His father had also died in an accident four years ago. Akash was an employee of a paper mill in Uttarakhand.

362,['18/02/2020'],"Why aren’t you filing civil suit for damages, asks HC","This story is from February 18, 2020

NEW DELHI: Frowning upon the practice of seeking damages by way of a writ petition , Delhi high court on Monday sought the stand of the Centre, AAP government and Delhi Police on a fresh plea by a Jamia Millia Islamia student seeking compensation for injuries.

The student claimed that he was seriously wounded in police assault during protests against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act on December 15. A bench of Chief Justice D N Patel and Justice C Hari Shankar was initially of the view that the petitioner should have filed a civil suit, if he was demanding compensation as claims would have to be proved through evidence.

“These are matters of evidence. Why are you not filing a suit for damages? On the basis of annexures in a writ, claims cannot be proved,” the high court said and added that “it has become a fashion in Delhi to file a writ for everything.”

But the bench subsequently issued notices to the Union ministry of home affairs, Jamia Millia and others asking them to file their response to the plea in which the student, Shayaan Mujeeb, alleged that both his legs got fractured in the “brutal violence carried out” by security personnel. Mujeeb has said he was at the university library on the day, when policemen entered the building and allegedly beat up the students there.

He also cited the available CCTV footage to allege that police entered the library and beat up the students, arguing that he should be granted Rs 2 crore as compensation for the injuries suffered. Mujeeb also sought registration of an FIR for the offences allegedly committed by cops, along with reimbursement of Rs 2 lakh, claiming he was forced to pay the amount for his medical treatment.

Earlier, another student, Mohammad Minhajuddin, had moved a plea seeking a probe into the incident and demanding compensation for injuries he suffered. Minhajuddin, according to the plea, lost vision in one eye during the incident.

On December 15 last year, anti-CAA protests near southeast Delhi’s Jamia turned violent, with demonstrators pelting stones at police and setting public buses and private vehicles on fire. Police later entered the university, firing teargas shells and baton-charged students. Several students, including the petitioner, were injured in the police crackdown.

AICC general secretary Jyotiraditya Scindia

BHOPAL/INDORE:AICC general secretary Jyotiraditya Scindia on Sunday reiterated his vow to “hit the streets” despite all the controversy it has generated.

Speaking to reporters in Gwalior, Scindia said, “I am a public servant. Fighting for people’s issues is my dharma. Like I said, we must have patience since it has only been one year of the government. And promises we (Congress party) made in the manifesto must be fulfilled. If not, we have to hit the streets.”

On Monday, AICC general secretaries Mukul Wasnik and Deepak Babaria addressed a press conference in Bhopal but refused to answer questions on Scindia. Asked about bickering in the party, Wasnik handed over the microphone to Babaria who said, “I am here for the next two to three days. I will answer these questions later.”

Last Thursday, Scindia had told guest teachers, who are on strike demanding regularization of service, that he will be their “shield and sword” if the Kamal Nath government does not fulfil the manifesto promise of regularizing them. “Your demands were made part of the Congress’ election manifesto. That manifesto is holy text for us. If the promises made in the manifesto are not fulfilled, then don’t think you will be left alone. Jyotiraditya Scindia will hit the streets with you.”

In Indore, BJP ‘sympathized’ with Scindia, with Indore-2 MLA Ramesh Mendola inviting him to the installation ceremony of a 66-ft-tall statue of Lord Hanuman. He advised Scindia that reciting Hanuman Chalisa will “show him a way out of the crisis he is in”.

Mendola, a trusted aide of BJP general secretary Kailash Vijayvargiya, wrote to Scindia about the event at Pitra Parvat (a hill on Indore’s outskirts), and said: “The kind of treatment chief minister Kamal Nath has given you, after you reminded him of promises made in the manifesto, is sad and painful. I believe, praying to Lord Hanuman will give you strength and courage in this time of grief. Through this letter, I am inviting you to participate in idol installation ceremony of Piterashwar Hanuman Dham, which is being carried out in presence of many saints till March 3.”

“Reciting ‘Sundarkand’ or Hanuman Chalisa will help you deal with the challenges you are facing in your party and will also give you strength to fight injustice and win (the political battle). This letter is written with good intention and don’t draw any political conclusions or other sense of it,” Mendola mentions at the end.

MPCC general secretary Satyanarayan Patel — a Scindia supporter — denied there is any crisis. “Scindia ji is facing no challenge in the party, neither is he in any trouble. However, if Mendola wants him to attend the religious programme and if he has written with good intentions, Scindia ji may participate.”

364,['18/02/2020'],Kerala HC: No licence sans privacy assessment,"This story is from February 18, 2020

Kerala high court

KOCHI: No new licence or renewal should be granted for toddy shops in residential areas without assessing impact on privacy of nearby residents, the high court has ordered.

The order was issued by Justice A Muhamed Mustaque after considering five petitions by residents alleging violation of fundamental rights due to operation of toddy shops in residential areas.

In the 46-page judgment, the court also asked the state government to consider ways to modernize toddy shops.

Being the protector and guardian of fundamental rights, the government is obliged to take positive measures against breach of fundamental rights due to its action or private action, the court said.

“There is no embargo in our Constitution in recognizing human rights protected under Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights to have protection to respect for private and family life and his home. Therefore, no toddy shops can be established in a residential area in derogation of the rights of the individual to have respect for his private and family life and home,” the judgment said.

Whether operation of a toddy shop violates the fundamental rights of nearby residents is a matter that can only be ascertained on a case by case basis, the court said. European Convention on Human Rights adopted assessment based on ‘threshold severity test’, which refers to the minimum level of severity of the action complained of, the court noted.

As per the judgment, such tests would take place in proximity of toddy shop with a residential building and other factors that would affect privacy right such as noise, emissions, odours, and any other forms of interference for the quiet enjoyment of one’s home. The assessment should also contain a negative test, which refers to amenities one would be able to enjoy in the absence of a toddy shop nearby. The court also said no empirical data is needed and violation of one person’s privacy right is sufficient to deny licence.

Laying down the test of assessment on the impact of privacy rights, the court said no toddy shop should be located in a residential area infringing the right of privacy of a nearby resident, that threshold severity test assessment must be conducted for assessing breach of privacy right, and the commissioner of excise can consider complaints of privacy breach.

TRICHY: Archaeological excavation has become a people’s movement as public have come forward demanding excavation at Keeladi, ASI (Archaeological survey of India) superintending archaeologist Amarnath Ramakrishna said on Monday. He was addressing students at Jamal Mohamed College as part of a national seminar on Keeladi excavations.

“Excavation was carried out in 157 places in Tamil Nadu, but that has not been noticed. Keeladi became popular as people were made aware of the history of the land,” he said. He thanked many Muslim land owners for offering their land during the initial period of excavation and as a result it has become so popular.

Saying that excavation in Keeladi must continue setting aside politics, he said, “It was a small team in 2012-13 led by me that carried preliminary survey along Vaigai river. It has now popularised the history of this region across the world.”

“But it was possible only when people were made aware of our history and significance of this place. It took this long as we did not realise the richness of our history,” said Amarnath as he asked students across discipline to read history.

Explaining the effectiveness of grid pattern of excavation which was adopted across north India by ASI, he said the state archaeology relied on vertical trench during its previous excavations which wasn’t very effective.

The Keeladi excavation has taken history of Sangam era from 300 BC to 600 BC. “Several archaeological excavation findings in 2004 have given evidence that Harappan civilization was built by ancestral south Indians. We have established that it was Dravidians who have migrated from Harappa to the south of India but there is need for further exploration to establish the links,” he said.

NEW DELHI: Two men on their way to allegedly extort money from a trader at the Okhla mandi were killed in an encounter with the special cell in the early hours of Monday near Pul Prahladpur in south Delhi.

Following a tip-off, police spotted Rafiq and Ramesh on a motorcycle around 5.51am and asked them to surrender. But the men tried to flee and allegedly opened fire at the cops, who fired back. A huge cache of arms, including pistols and ammunition of different bores, were found on them.

As the men reportedly tried to speed away, the cops blocked their way due to which the bike skidded and both fell on the road. Instead of surrendering, both Rafiq and Ramesh whipped out pistols and started firing at the police team. Five of the shots hit four cops, all of whom were saved due to bullet-proof jackets. A police Gypsy was also damaged.

When the cops retaliated, Rafiq and Ramesh were hit on the chest, back and the legs. They were immediately taken to the AIIMS trauma centre but were declared dead on arrival.

Ramesh was using a 9mm pistol and Rafiq, a .30 bore one, said an officer. They were also found to be carrying a bag containing another .32 bore pistol and eight live rounds. Four pouches containing about 60 rounds of 7.62mm cartridges were also found on Rafiq. Police claimed the duo had been threatening several wholesale dealers in the Okhla mandi to extort money from them.

A probe revealed that Ramesh and Rafiq had killed Ramesh’s father over a property dispute, said a source. Rafiq was also involved in shooting at two cops and a property dealer in Karawal Nagar last week and then travelled to Loni to eliminate another property dealer for refusing to pay him protection money. Later that night, he killed Salman, who used to deal in real estate, in Loni.

Rafiq, who was involved in at least seven attempt-to-murder and murder cases, was earlier booked under the Gangster Act in Uttar Pradesh. Last year, he killed Kishor alias Langda from Karawal Nagar, with whom he was involved in a turf war. He was also wanted in the murder of a cricket bookie, Javed, in 2019.

Nagpur: Municipal commissioner Tukaram Mundhe has dropped the plan to develop five garbage transfer stations and transferred its allocated funds of Rs40 crore for the bio-mining project. Garbage transfer stations were planned to achieve the status of Garbage Free City.

Mundhe, who took over the charge of CEO of Smart City special purpose vehicle — Nagpur Smart and Sustainable City Development Corporation Limited (NSSCDCL) — took the decision in the meeting to review the Smart City Project on Tuesday.

Mundhe directed NSSCDCL officials to stop the ongoing tendering process for the appointment of private contractors to develop the stations.

Mundhe’s predecessor Abhijit Bangar had planned to develop one garbage transfer station in each of the ten zones. For decades, sanitary workers of Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) used to dump garbage collected from streets and roads in a given location in each area. Also, staffers of the private garbage operator used to dump garbage collected from households at the same spots. Then, big trucks used to come and take away the garbage. But the garbage used to exist at many locations across the city causing inconvenience to the people and pollution. Therefore, Bangar planned garbage transfer stations where garbage will come and systematically taken away in big trucks to Bhandewadi dumping yard. Funds of Rs40 crore from Smart City Project was sanctioned for five stations and remaining five were supposed to be developed later.

NMC sources told TOI that Mundhe directed the officials of health department to ensure no garbage is dumped and transferred directly from sanitary workers’ tubs and small vehicles into big trucks. “Mundhe might have felt shortage of funds for bio-mining which is under way and very crucial for scientific disposal of 6-8 lakh tonne garbage lying at Bhandewadi dumping yard for decades and also to free the 32-acre land,” sources said.

Considering the past experience, now Garbage Free City may not be achieved without garbage transfer stations.

Mundhe directed the officials to adopt and spread awareness about the four Rs — reduce, reuse, recycle and refuse. He meant citizens should reduce the quantum of garbage by reusing wet garbage at households itself for compost, recycle dry waste and refuse to use plastic.

As the decision was taken by board of directors of NSSCDCL, Mundhe reportedly took the decision after taking the consent of chairman Praveen Pardeshi.

The scam relates to corruption in the multi-crore procurement of technical gadgets such as mobile phones, CCTV systems, tablet PCs, GPS, CCTV camera and spare battery for VHF sets by the technical wing in the office of the Director General of Police (DGP).

A superintendent of police (SP) level officer, Anbuchezhian, is the main accused in the case and his residence was one of the 18 places raided by the DVAC on February 8. An FIR was registered the previous day, according to a DVAC statement.

The FIR in this case, if published, would shed light on private companies and individuals which/ who are alleged beneficiaries of procedural violations in the tender processing. At least three officers of the technical wing are under the scanner in the case.

The DVAC is supposed to publish all FIRs on its website as per a Supreme court order dated September 7, 2016, in the writ petition no 68/2016. All FIRs are usually to its portal within 3 or 4 days. The agency has uploaded an FIR relating to another case booked on February 7. It has published FIRs of the several high-profile cases such as the Anna University re-evaluation scam, the arrest of a vice-chancellor and the corruption allegations against former vice-chancellors of Anna and TN Law universities. However, when it comes to high profile cases involving the police department, the DVAC has in an earlier occasion too avoided publishing the FIR. DVAC officers including its heads are drawn from the police.

In the gutka scam, the first case was filed by the special investigation cell (SIC) of the DVAC. The FIR was not published on its website and many activists had raised a stink then.

Jayaram Venkatesan, convenor of Arappor Iyakkam which had earlier campaigned for greater transparency in the DVAC, said government bodies can’t be selective when it comes to transparency. “The agency cannot say they will put out only those FIRs they deem as fit. In cases where privacy of victims is at stake, publication can be avoided. But in corruption cases, the agency should be as transparent as possible,” he said.

Vijaykumar, the director of DVAC, did not respond to calls from TOI seeking comment. However, sources in the agency said it was their prerogative to publish FIRs. “If the officials feel some cases are sensitive, the case details will not be uploaded,” a source said.

Visakhapatnam: The National Council of Science Museums (NCSM) under the ministry of culture will prepare the detailed project report (DPR) for the proposed planetarium on Kailasagiri Hilltop Park. The Visakhapatnam Metropolitan Region Development Authority (VMRDA) has decided to hand over the responsibility of the DPR to NCSM instead of opting for a private consultant in view of the council’s expertise in setting up planetariums and science centres. The NCSM will shortly start work on the DPR based on inputs provided by the VMRDA.

The VMRDA has also constituted a technical committee comprising professionals in developing planetariums and museums from across the country to receive inputs on dome size, seating arrangement, type of projectors, content available for screening and maintenance. Representatives from the NCSM are also part of the technical committee.

Speaking to TOI, VMRDA metropolitan commissioner P Koteswara Rao said the agency convened the second technical committee meeting this Sunday. “The team extensively discussed the technical specifications and modalities of operation of the proposed planetarium. Besides proposing various emerging and advanced technologies, the committee recommended visiting at least three to four planetariums in the country to get an idea of merits and demerits of the existing technology and future technology,” said Koteswara Rao.

The metropolitan commissioner added that the VMRDA plans to design and develop the planetarium by studying various immersive models in the world such that it meets technology needs for the next two decades. “The virtual tour of the universe will help create scientific curiosity on astronomy, space science and other related fields among students and youth. The NCSM will start preparing the DPR in the next 15 days. It may take about 45 days to complete the DPR. International seminars, lectures and workshops will be conducted at the planetarium apart from providing a platform for a discipline-based education research for postgraduates and research scholars,” said Koteswara Rao.

A team of officials from the VMRDA headed by Koteswara Rao recently visited the National Council of Science Museum and Birla Planetarium in Kolkata.

373,['18/02/2020'],24x7 water supply: CM seeks timeline,"This story is from February 18, 2020

New Delhi: With 24-hour water supply being one of the 10 promises made by AAP in its “guarantee card” ahead of the polls, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Tuesday called a meeting of various stakeholders to prepare a roadmap to achieve the target.

Apart from DJB officials, minister Satyendar Jain, who has been given the charge of water department in the third term of AAP government, also attended the meeting. Sources said Kejriwal sought a timeline on achieving the target of supplying good-quality piped water round-the-clock to every household in the city in the next five years.

The CM has also called a meeting of all officials and ministers on Wednesday where the implementation of the 10-point guarantee card will be discussed.

Sources said about 93% of the residential areas in Delhi were so far connected with water pipelines. To provide round-the-clock water, the government’s first target is to connect every colony with the network. Augmenting the availability of water to meet the increased demand is another challenge it faces.

“The CM also discussed the possible ways of increasing the availability of water. Rejuvenation of waterbodies and the creation of a reservoir along the Yamuna north of Wazirabad are two important projects that were discussed,” an official said.

Delhi government has initiated an ambitious plan to tap Yamuna rainwater by building a 1,000-acre mega reservoir. The project aims at conserving water in the floodplain between Palla on Delhi-Haryana border and Wazirabad to deal with the shortage in the capital. The government will build small ponds on the floodplain, which will catch excess water from the overflowing river during monsoons.

According to officials, civil work has already started on the project.

Delhi’s estimated water demand at present is around 1,150 million gallons daily (MGD) while DJB provides around 950 MGD. For the 24×7 water supply project, this 200 MGD gap could be the difference between success and failure, said officials.

Two upscale colonies in Malviya Nagar area — Navjeevan Vihar and Geetanjali Enclave — are already part of a PPP-mode pilot project where over 600 houses have been getting 24X7 supply. A similar project all over Delhi will not only require a robust leakage proof pipeline system but also surplus availability of water.

BHOPAL: The state information commission on Monday slapped a penalty of Rs 25000 on a joint collector for not providing information to an applicant under RTI Act 2005. The move came after the official denied information regarding the disbursement of drought relief and funds used for digging a well to an applicant.

Sources said that the applicant Pradeep Ahirwar, a Bhopal resident, had sought information regarding fund used in digging a well on his land and also about disbursement of drought relief money from chief municipal officer of Tikamgarh in March 2017. When the information was not provided, he moved a first appeal with Tikamgarh collector who ordered the PIO to provide the information. But despite orders, the deputy collector Pratap Singh Chouhan did not provide the information. Later the applicant moved a second appeal before the commission. A total of five hearings were held, but the official concerned did not appear. Later, he moved an application saying that he should not be penalised as he had provided the information sought in “point 1 of the application” and he had been transferred from the district.

State information commissioner Rahul Singh, in his order, said that the first appellate authority in the case, who was the then collector, had ordered to provide the information much before the transfer of the PIO, but the information was not provided. Thereafter, Singh imposed a penalty of Rs 25000 on the official. Besides, the then CMO Singh also issued show-cause notice to the present CMO asking why a fine of Rs 25000 should not be imposed on him as he too had not provided the information.

Activities covered under the guidelines include trekking and mountaineering, jeep safaris, all-terrain vehicle... Read More

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Highlighting that safety and quality are pivotal for the growth of high-potential adventure tourism in Kerala , tourism minister Kadakampally Surendran said on Monday that 50 major adventure tourism centres in the state will be upgraded to meet the national and global standards.

The minister’s announcement came during the launch of a set of comprehensive safety and security regulations aimed to position the state as a prime, secure and hassle-free destination for adventure-loving holidaymakers and nature buffs.

Surendran also launched an online accreditation portal to provide registration for qualified adventure activity providers (AAP), based on the guidelines drawn up by Kerala Adventure Tourism Promotion Society (KATPS), under the state tourism department. The validity of the registration is for two years.

Noting the guidelines set by Kerala Adventure and Activities Based Tourism Safety and Security Regulations for conduct of 31 land, water and air-based activities, the minister said Muzhappilangad (Kannur), Kaapil (Varkala) and Vagamon (Idukki) will be designated as adventurous tourism centres. “A proposal to set up adventure parks in all districts is also under the consideration of the government, as per the availability of land,” he said.

Listing five ways of developing adventure tourism, the minister said basic infrastructure in the existing adventure tourism spots needs to be developed initially. This should be followed by identifying and developing new spots, promoting public-private projects and creating a circuit connecting adventure tourism centres. Finally, the state has to brand its adventure tourism nationally and internationally. Currently, KATPS in association with the forest department is conducting activities in forest areas, he said.

“Soft adventure parks have already been started in Veli, Asramam in Kollam, Thenmala, Karlad in Wayand and Kottappuram. Preparations are in the final stages in Munnar to start paragliding activities. Besides, an adventure tourism academy will be set up at Sasthampara near the state capital,” Surendran added.

Tourism secretary Rani George, who presided over the function, said except desert-based activities and snow-capped mountain activities, Kerala has all the potential to emerge as a top adventure tourism destination. “Approval has been given for commencing a training course in adventure tourism at Kerala Institute of Tourism and Travel Studies (KITTS), in association with private tour operator Muddy Boots,” she added.

The guidelines lay emphasis on essential parameters for activity providers such as having proper licence as prescribed by the state or central government norms, deployment of qualified personnel, including well-trained activity leaders with hands-on experience, use of quality equipment and knowledge of first aid and safety and risk mitigation ability.

Mumbai: Noted Bengali actor and former Trinamool Congress MP Tapas Paul died of cardiac arrest in a Juhu hospital early on Tuesday. He was 61. Hindi audiences know him as the co-actor who featured opposite Madhuri Dixit in her debut film ‘Abodh’ in 1984.

The Kolkata-based artiste had arrived in Mumbai to meet his daughter Sohini last month. His wife Nandini said he was leaving for the US for treatment on February 1 when he took ill at the airport and was taken to a hospital. He remained on ventilator till February 6. “He was taken off the ventilator and was recovering but suddenly his condition worsened and he died of cardiac arrest around 3.30am on Tuesday,” she told PTI.

Paul became popular from his first film ‘Dadar Kirti’ (1980) followed by ‘Parabat Priya’, ‘Bhalobasa Bhalobasa’, ‘Anurager Choyan’ and ‘Amar Bandhan’. Madhuri Dixit tweeted: “The loss of Tapas Paul, who was one of the very first actors I have worked with, is felt by many. May God bless and comfort his family during this difficult period.”

He worked with artistes like Prosenjit, Soumitra Chatterjee, Ranjit Mallick and Raakhee. His colleagues Debashree Roy and Chiranjeet Chakraborty, both TMC MLAs, said they had lost a dear friend and the film industry a brilliant actor.

The two-term former MP from Krishnanagar retreated from cinema and active politics after CBI arrested him in the Rose Valley chit-fund scam in December 2016. He was in prison for 13 months.

West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee said, “Saddened and shocked to hear about the demise of Tapas Paul. He was a superstar of Bengali cinema who was a member of the Trinamool family. Tapas served the people as a two-term MP and MLA. We will miss him dearly. My condolences to his wife Nandini, daughter Sohini and his many fans.”

BAREILLY: A 24-year-old national level shooter, who was depressed over not being able to find a job, was found hanging at her house in Biharipur on Saturday night.

The victim, Lavi Yadav , had won several state-level championships and participated in national events.

According to family members, the victim, a BSc in physical education and daughter of an anganwadi worker, was upset over not being able to build a career which might have prompted her to take the extreme step. They said that the other family members were away in Rampur to attend a wedding since February 9. They added that she had not spoken with them since Thursday after which they sent a relative to check on her.

The family members said that the relative then alerted police who broke open the door and found Lavi hanging. Kotwali SHO Geestesh Kapil said, “Lavi was a national shooter and had represented the state in several events. Her father told us that she was upset because of her career. She was looking for a job after completing her education. The autopsy report has confirmed that she died due to hanging and the room was locked from inside which suggests that she ended her life. We have recorded the statement of all family members.”

378,['18/02/2020'],CRZ norms flouted along coast: Activists,"This story is from February 18, 2020

Visakhapatnam: City activists, in a letter to the chief city planner of Greater Visakhapatnam Municipal Corporation (GVMC), have drawn attention to violation of coastal regulation zone ( CRZ ) norms by new constructions at three locations on the Beach Road .

The activists have also sought an explanation from the civic body on how the upcoming structures are being allowed to come up against the prescribed norms.

“CRZ violations are happening at several places, mainly in areas close to the Beach Road and beyond towards Bheemli. We have asked the chief city planner to look into the issue,” said Narashimham Tenneti, a city-based social activist. “Most of these are under-construction projects. There are other completed projects as well which violate the CRZ norms.”

In the last few years, dozens of activists have filed RTI applications seeking the status of buildings in the city that violate CRZ norms. However, the civic body is yet to reply to a single RTI. “We have identified around 37 CRZ violations along the district’s 136km-long coastline. Most of these structures are within city limits and come under the jurisdiction of GVMC. But the civic body is yet to reply to our RTI queries,” alleged Arijili Dasu, who has been protesting against ‘illegal’ constructions on Beach Road.

The constructions include both private and government properties. Besides hotels, residential and commercial complexes, a religious complex belonging to an international organization is also in the ‘CRZ norms violating’ list, he added.

GVMC officials, when asked for their reaction, said they have stopped giving new permissions to constructions on the eastern side of the Beach Road stretch which is along the coastline. “We have hired a private agency to study the issue. It will submit a status report soon on the future course of action along the coastline,” a GVMC official said.

Representative image

NEW DELHI: Delhi high court on Monday sought response of the Centre and CBI on a plea seeking a court-monitored probe into the alleged molestation of students at Delhi University’s Gargi College last week.

A bench of Chief Justice D N Patel and Justice C Hari Shankar issued a notice to both the authorities on a plea filed by advocate M L Sharma.

Sharma moved the court last week, hours after the Supreme Court declined to entertain the petition and asked him to move the high court. He has sought preservation of all recordings and CCTV footage of the college campus. The plea also sought the arrest of people behind the “planned criminal conspiracy.”

Meanwhile, Delhi Police has arrested several people between 18 and 25 years on February 12 in connection with the incident. On February 6, a group of men broke into Gargi College during a festival, ‘Reverie’, and allegedly groped, harassed and molested the students, who claimed that the security officials stood watching.

The incident came to light after some students took to Instagram to narrate their ordeal and alleged that security personnel did nothing to control the unruly groups.

“It is a clear criminal conspiracy hatched by the political party to deploy accused persons to provoke the public for voting in their favour. Despite the presence of Delhi Police... on February 6, neither the principal nor the other state authorities tried to stop and arrest the accused persons,” the PIL claimed. It added, “deliberate chants of Jai Shri Ram disclose that it is a political, planned conspiracy” and blamed the chief minister for not taking action against the accused.

According to police, a case was registered under IPC sections 452 (house-trespass after preparation for hurt, assault or wrongful restraint), 354 (assault or criminal force to woman with intent to outrage her modesty), 509 (word, gesture or act intended to insult the modesty of a woman) and 34 (acts done by several persons in furtherance of common intention).

380,['18/02/2020'],"Bhopal: BMHRC, AIIMS merger junked, hospital may get status of autonomous body","This story is from February 18, 2020

Bhopal Memorial Hospital & Research Centre, Bhopal

BHOPAL: After reiterating in MP high court for a couple of years that a proposal to merge Bhopal Memorial Hospital & Research Centre (BMHRC) with All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) was under active consideration of the health department, department of health & research (DHR) seems to have abandoned the idea.

The minutes of a meeting of a high-level committee in January 2020 clearly indicates that in place of merger of BMHRC with AIIMS, Bhopal, the committee is now looking to run the hospital on the lines of Sree Chitra Tirunal Institute for Medical Sciences and Technology (SCTIMST), an autonomous institution under the ministry of science and technology, government of India. The committee was constituted by Union health minister to find ways and means for the revival of BMHRC, the hospital established in 1998 under the monitoring of the apex court for proper medical care of survivors of gas disaster.

The minutes have reference to detailed discussion on the ‘fate’ of BMHRC and how could it be used to its optimum potential but there is no mention of why the idea of BMHRC’s merger with AIIMS was dropped and how administering the hospital on the lines of SCTIMST caught fancy of the high-level committee comprising representatives of DHR, AIIMS, Bhopal, AIIMS Delhi and BMHRC.

It only states, “During discussions, members were of the view that BMHRC may be administered and run on the lines of Sree Chitra Tirunal Institute for Medical Sciences and Technology”. It was also pointed out that during the meeting held by secretary of DHR with the representatives of staff of BMHRC, it had emerged that the merger of AIIMS with AIIMS, Bhopal will have certain difficulties in terms of integration of manpower. It was felt that certain steps needed to be taken to attract and retain the faculty and doctors in BMHRC. Attempts need to be made to fulfill the requirements for commencement/continuation of DNB courses in the hospital on regular basis. The possibility of award of degrees of DM/MCH by SCTIMST to students enrolled in BMHRC may also be explored”.

In its recommendations, the high-level committee said that BMHRC may function as an independent institute on the lines of SCTIMST, Trivandrum, as a teaching institute, an MoU may be entered into with SCTIMST for awarding post-graduate degrees to students in BMHRC, an MoU may be entered with AIIMS, Bhopal for faculty sharing for clinical services and for posting of students to fulfil NBE and other requirements. The committee further recommended that faculty may be recruited on contractual basis with a consolidated remuneration as on par with SCTIMST/AIIMS, New Delhi.

Rachna Dhingra, co-founder of Bhopal Group for Information & Action (BGIA), which is an intervener in the contempt petition against DHR for not complying with the August 2012 Supreme Court order asking DHA to promote BMHRC as an institute of medical education, while reacting strongly to fresh proposal to run the hospital on the lines of SCTIMST, said: “SCTIMST is run on PP (public-private) partnership model. It means DHR wants to go back to Justice Ahmadi’s Trust era, when the hospital was run on that model. We fail to understand when AIIMS, Bhopal is there in the backyard of BMHRC, why should they think of aligning with a hospital as far away as Trivandrum. Besides, there is no clarification why idea of merger with AIIMS was dropped and who gave the idea of developing the hospital on the lines of SCTIMST. If you look at the minutes carefully, you will see that there is reference to stakeholders in the context of BMHRC time and again but no reference to gas disaster survivors even once. In fact, DHR could never understand why BMHRC was special and why it must be administered with personal attention”.

Purnendu Shukla, member of Supreme Court monitoring committee formed to keep a tab on medical facilities being provided to gas victims at gas relief hospitals and BMHRC and report it to the MP high court, said: “As far as I understand, it is another ploy to buy time as the high court is being very strict with DHR on appointment of doctors and other issues related to BMHRC or else there is no logic in not exploring the possibility of its merger with AIIMS, Bhopal and abruptly start talking about a hospital in Kerala. I can’t say more since details of discussions or anything related to the high-level committee was ever discussed with us”.

BAREILLY: Two youths were arrested for allegedly attempting to abduct two girls and thrashing their father in Bahjoi area of Sambhal district late in the night of January 25.

in his complaint, the father alleged, “Few men in police uniform introduced themselves as excise officers and barged into my house late in the night of January 25. They asked for liquor, but when we failed to provide them liquor, they gangraped my daughters and thrashed me when I resisted. The accused tried to abduct my daughters in their car, but they fled when I raised alarm.”

Following the complaint, police lodged an FIR against the unidentified men under sections 323 (voluntarily causing hurt), 354 (assault or criminal force to woman with intent to outrage her modesty) and 504 (intentional insult with intent to provoke breach of the peace) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC).

Sambhal district police chief Yamuna Prasad said, “After the girls’ family stated that the girls were gangraped, we sent them for a medical examination, but it was not established in the medical report. In their statement recorded before the magistrate, the girls didn’t mention about rape. Meanwhile, two crime branch teams were pressed to nab the accused. Two accused, Krishan Pal and Mate Pal, were arrested on Monday.”

Prasad said acting on a tip-off, crime team inspector Rakam Singh nabbed two persons, both residents of Bahrauli village under Behjoi police station limits, from the crossing of Behata Jai Singh village and seized two country-made pistols and cartridges from their possession, which they had snatched from passers-by.

“During interrogation, they disclosed the names of their accomplices, who had accompanied them on January 25, as Dhirendra and Rajendra, residents of the same village,” said Prasad.

382,['18/02/2020'],"Slow work on two city flyovers trigger traffic jams, irk commuters, shopkeepers","This story is from February 18, 2020

Bareilly: The commute between the busy crossings at Choupla and Lal Phatak — along both of which two separate flyovers are being built — has become a nightmare, allege residents, what with the slow pace of construction work.

Roads in both areas are lying damaged for several months owing to the construction work. This is on top of the chaos after 9pm every day, when heavy vehicles enter the city and crowd these roads. While commuters decry the dilapidated roads, locals and shopkeepers allege businesses are suffering.

Gaurav Singh, who lives near Lal Phatak and uses the road every day, said, “Construction work kicks up dust, and its slow pace exacerbates our suffering. Motorists going to Budaun have been driving through dust on both roads for around a year now.”

According to the Bridge Corporation, the Lal Phatak flyover is currently awaiting a no-objection certificate (NOC) from the military.

The plight of those who live near or commute via Choupla and City Station road is similar. Anil, a shopkeeper at Choupla, said, “Traffic is allowed on the dilapidated road close to the construction site, which has created the potholes that commuters have to negotiate while driving to Chowki crossing and Rampur-Moradabad highway. Authorities haven’t taken any steps to even mend that part of the road which is open to traffic.”

“Congestion, which is bad during the day, becomes worse after 9pm as Roadways buses and loaded trucks enter city limits. Choupla remains blocked for around two hours every night, as soon as they enter. I get stuck in jams on my way home almost every day,” said shopkeeper Raju Rathore.

Bridge Corporation officials admitted undertaking construction work and simultaneously ensuring free vehicular movement is a tough job. Speaking to TOI, Bareilly deputy project manager of Uttar Pradesh State Bridge Corporation (UPSBC), B K Sen, said, “The flyover at Choupla is a complex project as it has to be connected with an existing flyover. We’ve already taken steps to ensure traffic is not completely stopped. We’re working on the project from three directions, to ensure that partial movement is allowed. It’s a time-consuming project.”

Sen added, “Approximately 80% of the Lal Phatak project work is completed. The part left is a bridge over the railway line, which will be done by Railways. We’re waiting for an NOC from the military, as land needed to build a service road comes under them. We expect to acquire it within a month.”

Chennai: ‘Women in Blue’ seem to have come to the rescue for Oz land tourism when bush fires were proving a dampner downunder. Given that the Women’s Cricket World Cup is about to be hosted in Australi starting February 21, the country is seeing a jump in bookings for February and March.

Travel portals such as Ixigo, Pickyourtrail etc are seeing a 10%-20% pick up in bookings compared to December and January. Industry players add that Tourism Australia’s campaign to promote their Women’s World Cup drew interest. The tournament is drawing Indian travellers interest after what Mithali Raj and her team achieved in 2019.

The platform is seeing a spike in interest from women after the bushfires caused a 40% drop in travel to the land down under in Decmber-January. “The ICC roped in Mithali Raj, who was a star last world cup and this promotion has struck a chord with cricket fans. We are seeing a 20% increase in booking quarter on quarter,” said Hari Ganapathy, co-founder, Pickyourtrail. The travel curator has packages starting from Rs 35,999 for one match as an official partner for the ICC.

Flight-booking platform Ixigo, which saw a 21% drop in December-January, is seeing an 80% jump since then, in the bookings for February. ""While bookings for Australia took a slight dip in Dec and Jan due to the bushfires, there has been a 10%-15% increase in search queries for travel to Australia in February and March as compared to the same time last year. Around 45% of the search queries are coming from Mumbai and Bangalore. Travellers are spending anywhere between Rs 2 -Rs 5 lakh on their trips. Melbourne is the most searched for destination followed by Sydney, Brisbane and Adelaide,” said Aloke Bajpai, co-founder and CEO, Ixigo.

Besides watching the match, women-only travel groups are planning a holiday timed with the World Cup series.

Represenatative Image

MADURAI: The Madras high court has sought a response from the state on a plea challenging a government order (GO) notifying the conduct of jallikattu at Srivaikuntam taluk in Tuticorin district.

In his petition, deputy secretary of Anaithu Viyabarigal Sangam at Srivaikundam, M Balasubramanian stated that the government had brought an amendment in the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act, 1960, in order to permit jallikattu which is part of the tradition and culture in Tamil Nadu . He stated that jallikattu is unknown to the people of Srivaikuntam as it was not conducted there in the past.

No one is rearing bulls for the purpose of jallikattu in Srivaikuntam and it has not been organised during any temple festivals. He said the government had passed a GO on February 4, notifying to conduct jallikattu at Srivaikuntam.

Srivaikuntam had witnesses several communal tensions in the past and apprehended that the conduct of jallikattu would cause communal tension in the area.

He noted that the panchayat presidents of 15 villages have sent a representation to the authorities against granting permission to conduct jallikattu.

Hence, the petitioner moved the high court Madurai bench seeking to quash the GO which was passed notifying the conduct of jallikattu and also sought the authorities concerned not to grant permission for jallikattu at Srivaikuntam.

When the petition was taken up for hearing on Monday, a division bench of justice M Duraiswamy and justice T Ravindran sought a response from the government and adjourned the case to a further date.

Pilibhit: Responding to the directive of the National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA) in October that all tiger reserves, national parks and wildlife sanctuaries across the country phase out night stay of tourists in core forest areas, Pilibhit Tiger Reserve on Monday sent details of two alternative sites to the state forest administration.

According to principal chief conservator of forest (wildlife) of UP, Sunil Pandey, the state forest administration had consented to wind up all night stay facilities of tourists in core forest areas in phases in a span of five years. Following this, the state forest administration had issued directions to all three tiger reserves in UP to expedite the submission of optional sites for their transformation into the eco tourist spots.

In PTR, tourists can stay the night at a facility in Chuka tourist spot, situated in the dense core forest area of Mahof forest range.

The forest officials said while the NTCA has only banned night stay facility in core forest areas, at least 20% of the core forest will remain open for tourists for day visits.

“Of the two sites, the mouth of river Gomti in Madhotanda has already been developed by the district administration into a tourist destination in association with local volunteers. This comprises the Phulhar lake from where the river originates. It is saturated with Indian soft shell turtles which are listed in Schedule I of the Wildlife Protection Act,” said H Rajamohan, the field director of PTR.

A turtle rescue centre is already being set up at Phulhar lake and this will enhance the tourist centre, he added. The second site is proposed at Katakwara village near Barahi forest range, where seven to eight acres of gram panchayat land is available for developing the tourist spot, Rajamohan said.

Giving details about the proposed tourist spots, deputy director of PTR Naveen Khandelwal said tourists will be able to go boating in nearby river Sharda and bird watching, especially migratory birds in winter.

He said after reviewing the proposal, the state administration will send a team of experts for inspection of the sites before giving approval.

Visakhapatnam: Technical issues delayed the ongoing secretariat mapping on Monday in the district. District officials have started mapping households with ward/village secretariats a few days ago. The state government had designed a mobile application to collect data and complete the mapping process.

Technical issues such as frequent logging out and server disconnection are being reported in various parts of the district. On the other hand, poor connectivity is the biggest issue being faced by village volunteers in the tribal parts of the district.

Once a household is mapped to a certain volunteer, the volunteer is responsible for service delivery to it. Several migrants have returned to their villages to register their biometrics and get themselves mapped in the initiative but technical issues have slowed the process.

The district officials want to complete the mapping process by February 18 but the public wants an extension of the deadline in view of the technical glitches.

AAP MLA from Greater Kailash Saurabh Bharadwaj

NEW DELHI: Saurabh Bharadwaj , Aam Aadmi Party MLA from Greater Kailash , on Tuesday announced his decision to organise the recitation of “Sunderkand” on the first Tuesday of every month in areas of his constituency to seek the blessings of Lord Hanuman. The move prompted a sharp reaction from BJP.

Sunderkand is a chapter in Ramcharitmanas written by Tulsidas. It talks about Hanuman’s visit to Lanka. The first event was organised on Tuesday in Chirag Dilli. Bharadwaj participated in the programme and shared a video on Twitter. He said advance bookings had been made for the scheduled programmes and sponsors had also been found.

Delhi BJP spokesperson Praveen Shankar Kapoor claimed that the “sudden attachment” of chief minister Arvind Kejriwal and other AAP functionaries with Hanuman wasn’t a matter of faith, but just melodrama. Kapoor, however, added that he welcomed the move, as “those who were earlier seen at mosques and mazars are now going to temples, even though for political benefits”.

Bharadwaj responded by tweeting that while BJP might be fuming, people were happy to be a part of the programme. “It is so positive,” he stated.

During his election campaign, AAP chief convenor Arvind Kejriwal had told a TV channel that he was a staunch Hanuman bhakt and a firm believer in him since childhood. He had even recited a few lines from Hanuman Chalisa. Kejriwal’s visits to Hanuman Temple were criticised by many in BJP.

Bengaluru: The state cabinet on Monday constituted a sub-committee to look into the controversy surrounding land acquisition by Nandi Infrastructure Corridor Enterprise (NICE).

Sources say the sub-committee will specifically look into the acquisition of 370 acres which is under dispute. KIADB had purchased the land on behalf of the company and it is worth Rs 600 crore at current market prices. However, it is said NICE wants the land at rates prevalent when it was notified — at approximately Rs 60 crore.

The government will also examine the possibility of approaching court to iron out land acquisitions wrinkles involving the Bangalore Metro Rail Corporation Limited (BMRCL) and NICE.

A minister said 4.5 acres of land was supposed to have been handed over to BMRCL after managing director Ajay Sethi had initiated a process to purchase it from NICE. However, the government halted the process due to a dispute over NICE owning the property. “As a result, we have decided to form a cabinet sub-committee to discuss all these issues related to land acquisitions,” said the minister.

Meanwhile, another sub-committee has been formed to rationalise duplication of posts under various departments and expenditure on the state exchequer. This includes posts for engineers and other departmental posts, considering 60 to 65% of the government budget goes towards paying salaries.

The government has also decided to expand the ambit of the Open Disfigurement Act, currently only limited to Bengaluru, to the entire state.

This raised a concern at Chennai airport too, where immigration officials often face passengers who do not meet the screening parameters, say the ones arriving from destinations without infection risk, requesting to be screened.Sources say the number of passengers who arrive from these destinations is too high for staff of the Airport Health Office (APHO) under the ministry of health to handle. Often, they have to go by the self declaration given by the passengers on a card before they disembark.A survey by LocalCircles conducted among 40,000 people across the country, and also by going through the posts put up by people on their platform, show that people are not happy with the kind of screening done at airports. Around 2,000 people from Chennai took part in the survey.A spokesperson of LocalCircles said “multiple LocalCircles members outlined how screening at airports were minimum and one counter with two individuals to take temperature of 300-plus passengers and note their details is just not enough. A few of them reported how people were getting away from the screening. Infection experts on the platform said airport screening only catches about 25% of the patients, highlighting the need for a three, seven, ten and 15-day follow-ups with each patient by the respective state governments. This follow up is not being done in most states.”In Tamil Nadu, 47,645 passengers have been screened so far at Chennai, Trichy, Madurai and Coimbatore airports and 2,256 passengers are in home quarantine for 28 days. In Chennai, 650 passengers are in home quarantine for 28 days.And this has had an impact on foreign travel this summer.

Nagpur: Detection of murder case in which seven body parts of a man were found at Gandhisagar lake in July last year has won the best detection award in state for September last year.

Crime branch sleuths, then led by senior PI Narendra Hiwre , had cracked the case and also arrested the accused. Currently, Hiwre is the senior PI of Lakadganj police station.

PI Hiwre along with API Pankaj Dhadge, Nitesh Dorlikar, ASI Rajendra Baghel, constable Sandip Mawalkar will be awarded with Rs10,000 cash prize and certificate of appreciation in Mumbai.

The award was announced by director general of police, Maharashtra state SK Jaiswal.

On February 15, city police chief BK Upadhyay has also felicitated PI Hiwre and his team during the crime meet.

In July last year, seven body parts were found in a sack in Gandhisagar, following which additional CP (crime) Nilesh Bharne and DCP (crime) Gajanan Rajmane had directed Hiwre to crack the case.

Crime branch sleuths had scrutinized around 500 CCTV footages, also made sketch of the deceased and conducted investigation across the city. Cops had also searched every single missing person to find out the identity of the deceased and conducted DNA tests.

After a long investigation of 28 days, cops cracked the case and identified the deceased, Sudhakar Rangari.

Cops subsequently arrested the accused in the case and seized the cutter and e-rickshaw used in the crime. CP Upadhayay had then announced an award of Rs75,000 to PI Hiwre and his team.

This is the second award being conferred to Hiwre who first bagged it in 2003 for cracking a murder case of three persons in Khapa. He is the only officer from city and possibly in state to be getting the award twice.

CHENNAI: While several state governments fear shortage of life-saving and essential drugs after the outbreak of COVID-19 ( coronavirus disease) in China, government hospitals in the state say they have adequate stock of most drugs, both at hospitals and warehouses.The Tamil Nadu Medical Services Corporation (TNMSC) had revised its protocol to ensure supply of drugs doesn’t dwindle after January, when China closed down for their new year celebrations. During this time a year ago, state-run hospitals in Tamil Nadu faced an acute shortage of essential drugs used to treat bacterial infections, diabetes and renal diseases. This was because several Indian drug manufacturers could not import the active pharmaceutical ingredient from China during the Chinese New Year holidays.In October 2019, TNMSC made plans to stock adequate drugs. “We have stocks of most medicines to last till June,” said TNMSC managing director P Umanath. “We have ordered for more stock. It’s expected soon and will last us for a few more months after June,” he said. TNMSC officials said the agency could blacklist the company if it does not supply drugs on time.In early 2019, when TNMSC issued bids for drugs, there were no bidders for at least a dozen drugs. “Many of these were inexpensive but essential drugs. We had to call for tenders again to get the drugs,” he said. This was because many states order for generic drugs around the same time and the cost at which Tamil Nadu buys them is lower compared to many other states.Drug manufacturers in the state say there is no short supply though the price of some pharmaceutical ingredients has gone up. “The prices go up around this time every year,” said J Jayaseelan, chairman, Indian Drug Manufacturers Association (Tamil Nadu, Kerala and Pondicherry). “But they settle down by April. We feared that the lockdown due to the virus may bring down the supply and increase prices. But that hasn’t happened yet, and it won’t be fair to block exports assuming there will be a crisis.”",chennai,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74187645,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-401788,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/no-drug-shortage-in-state-due-to-covid-19-scare/articleshow/74182565.cms

ADGP Crime Branch Tomin Thachankery (right) inspects 660 INSAS rifles brought from 13 locations

KOCHI: A CBI probe was sought in high court over the alleged missing of 25 rifles and 12,061 live cartridges from Kerala Police . The demand for a CBI probe was raised in a public interest litigation [PIL] (WP-C No. 4513/2020) filed by George Vattukulam of Thrissur through advocate Joseph Rony Jose.

A division bench comprising Chief Justice S Manikumar and Justice Shaji P Chaly will consider the PIL during admission hearing on Tuesday.

Stating that the missing of rifles and cartridges, which was pointed out in a CAG report, has serious implication on national security, the petitioner alleged that neither the state government nor the state police chief are conducting a proper investigation.

Though several days have passed since the report was presented, investigation is not progressing and police force is trying to cover up the matter, the PIL claimed. The state police chief has not conducted a fair investigation and the probe into such a serious issue is not progressing due to the clout of influential persons, the petitioner alleged.

State police delayed the investigation and didn’t collect primary evidence, the PIL added. The agency failed to trace the missing ammunition and fix responsibility on the officers who committed the offence. Moreover, there were attempts to cover it up by replacing them with dummy bullets. Police doesn’t know where the missing rifles and cartridges went, the PIL said.

It is feared that this unfortunate incident was caused by corruption in the force due to politicizing through police association, IPS association, etc. The petitioner is worried as to what would happen if the missing arms and ammunition reaches the hands of anti-nationals, stated the petition.

Investigation by a national agency must commence at the earliest and any delay will affect collection of primary evidence, the petitioner has contended while seeking a court directive for a CBI probe.

MADURAI: The Madras high court has issued notice to the Tamil Nadu Uniformed Services Recruitment Board ( TNUSRB ) on a plea moved by 11 candidates challenging the provisional list of selected candidates for the post of grade II police constable, citing that the backlog vacancies under BC (Muslim) were not filled up.

The candidates belonging to various southern districts, belonging to BC Muslim category, in their petition, stated that the TNUSRB had issued a notification dated March 6, 2019 for recruitment of 8,888 posts of grade II police constable, including 62 backlog vacancies of BC (Muslim) category.

They stated that they had cleared the written examination which was conducted on August 25, 2019. They also passed the physical test and participated in certificate verification and were hoping to get selected under BC (Muslim) category.

When TNUSRB issued the provisional selection list on February 4, they were shocked to notice that only 10 backlog vacancies of the 62 were filled up. As per provisions of the Tamil Nadu Government Servants (Conditions of Service) Act, 2016, backlog vacancies should to be filled up first.

Hence, the petitioners moved the high court Madurai bench challenging the provisional selection list and sought to appoint them in the post of grade II police constable under BC (Muslim) category based on their marks. The petitioners also sought for an interim injunction restraining TNUSRB from issuing appointment orders to the provisionally selected candidates till the disposal of the petition.

When the petition was heard on Monday, justice M S Ramesh ordered notice to TNUSRB and adjourned the case to a further date for hearing.

Lose control: With the technology gone, the civic body has lost its ability to monitor the movement of its veh... Read More

BHOPAL: The vehicle tracking and monitoring system (VTMS), fitted in Bhopal Municipal Corporation (BMC) vehicles, has gone offline for almost a week now. This means that the civic body has effectively lost its ability to monitor the movement of its vehicles which transfer garbage, water and other services.

The GPS enabling of vehicles had been outsourced to a private company. However, BMC sources said GPS equipment has been placed offline due to non-payment. Off the record, a representative of the private company confirmed the same.

A meeting with senior BMC officials was held on Monday to resolve the situation. “We are working on putting the systems online. Some of the component of the management has to be taken care of by the smart city project,” said a BMC official.

GPS monitoring of vehicles takes place from the Integrated Control and Command Centre (ICCC) that operates from the Bhopal smart city building in Govindpura. Officials and a representative in ICCC did not alert BMC officials in time. The matter came to light when vehicles were checked at the civic body-run fuel station. Every vehicle's diesel consumption is matched with its GPS log.

When the system was put in place around two years ago, it exposed a diesel scam in the BMC. The civic body has a gas station that provides diesel to about 1,000 vehicles. The BMC station requires about one tank of 22,000 litre diesel each day, which amounts to a fuel bill of about Rs 4 crore per month.

BMC officials have also received complaints over garbage collection in the past week. “We cannot monitor the movement of vehicles. There is no way to determine the location and tracking of vehicles,” said a senior BMC official.

VTMS not only enables the waste management officials to monitor the vehicles, but also work carried out by the vehicles and the processes. The IT enabled system, linked with ICCC, is meant to improve productivity and curb pilferage.

The system is also meant to reduce the running cost, fuel costs and maintenance cost and has also helped in stopping unauthorised usage of municipal vehicles.

The vehicles are attached with GPS devices for location tracking, RFID readers to sense and verify the refuse bin pickups, fuel sensors to keep a track on the fuel used, and weight sensors to get information of weight collected at each garbage pickup location. The garbage bins are also fitted with RFID tag (passive tags), which are read by the garbage vehicle readers each time the bin is picked.

Visakhapatnam: The newly-opened museum of ancient jewellery at the Sri Varaha Lakshmi Nrusimha Swamy temple at Simhachalam , set up at an estimated cost of Rs 1 crore, lacks signage in English and in Hindi.

A devotee, P Ranganatha Sharma from Karnataka, expressed surprise at boards displaying information only in Telugu on a recent visit to the temple. “I did not understand what is written on the display boards for the jewellery inside the museum. It would be good if the temple management could provide information in both Hindi and English,” Sharma told TOI.

Another devotee said that apart from display boards inside the musuem, the temple should also set up signage at the foothill, toilets, bus stops and other spots around the temple in Hindi and in English.

When contacted, Simhachalam temple executive officer M Venkateswara Rao said they would take into consideration the devotees’ suggestion to have English and Hindi signboards inside the museum. Venkateswara Rao added that the management is looking into the possibility of introducing Odia and English sign boards, instead of Hindi and English, in view of the fact that a majority of visiting devotees are from Odisha.

The management is also considering includingthe history and importance in the description of each artefact on display, Venkateswara Rao said.

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The state government reiterated that there is a complete ban on plastic carry bags , including those made of compostable materials , in the state. Though the government has exempted product-attached straws from the ban, it banned plastic sapling bags .

The latest clarification comes in the wake of a decision taken by a task force, which was constituted to address concerns and complaints regarding ban on plastic in the state. The task force, headed by principal secretary, department of environment, had met on January 28 and February 4 to discuss various issues raised through representations by organizations and review the general situation after the plastic ban. The exemption for compostable materials shall be applicable only for grow bags and garbage bags meant for segregation and collection of biomedical waste.

The task force noted that the market is being invaded by fake compostable carry bags and both the public and shop owners find it unable to identify actual compostable carry bags and it defeated the very purpose of the plastic ban.

Even though the government had issued a clarification specifically for the use of compostable carry bags listing down alternative materials that could be used as substitutes for the banned single use plastic items, compostable bags continued to be in use as carry bags.

In the order issued to clarify use of compostable carry bags, the government had mentioned that carry bags whether made of compostable materials or other materials were banned and instead only cloth or paper bags are allowed to be used as carry bags.

In the new order, there is an exemption for grow bags as compostable materials can be used. The government has said that compostable products should bear the details of the manufacturer, marketing agency, material specification, date of manufacture, batch number, CPCB approval details with license number and validity in the form of QR code. The product shall bear the title ‘this is a purely compostable product’ written in English and Malayalam.

RAMPUR: Police have registered a case against Sunni Barelvi cleric and Ittehad-e-Millat Council president Maulana Tauqeer Raza for allegedly making derogatory remarks against Prime Minister Narendra Modi and home minister Amit Shah during an anti-CAA protest in Sambhal on Sunday evening.

Nakhasa station house officer Divender Dhama said that an FIR was registered against Raza under section 504 (intentional insult), 505 (incitement) and 153A (promoting enmity) of IPC based on a complaint lodged by sub-inspector Rambhool Singh.

According to police, Raza was addressing the anti-CAA protest at Pucca Bagh, where women have been on an agitation since January 24, when he made the remarks.

Raza said, “I am a law abiding citizen and always respect the law. The protests across the country are an attempt to save the Constitution. The time has now come to see which ideology prevails here — Gandhivadi or Godsevadi.” “I have been booked for raising questions against the government. I welcome this move and if they want to arrest me, I’m ready for that too,” he added.

The cleric said, “However, registering cases and sending people to jail is not the solution. They (BJP leadership) have to come forward to resolve the issue through meaningful dialogue.”

The SHO said, “Notices have been served to 75 people, including nine women, under section 149 of CrPC for staging a protest. The administration has also identified 11 people for instigating the protesters. They have been served notices under CrPC sections 107 (security for keeping peace) and 116 (inquiry as to truth of information) asking them to sign a personal bond of Rs 50 lakh each with an undertaking that they would not indulge in any disruptive activity.”

Chennai: A full bench of the Madras high court on Monday directed the state government to get an expert opinion from the National Environmental Engineering Research Institution (NEERI), Nagpur, on the ill effects of Prosopis juliflora ( seemai karuvelam), particularly on depletion of groundwater.

The full bench comprising chief justice A P Sahi, Justice M M Sundresh and Justice M Sundar passed the order on a PIL moved by advocate A Meganathan, seeking to forebear the authorities from drastically removing seemai karuvalam trees without scientific proof they have a negative effect. In April 2017, the first bench headed by then Chief Justice Indira Banerjee stayed the order to fell the trees and referred the matter to the full bench. Subsequently, an expert committee constituted by the court opined against removing them for alleged ill effects. Objecting to the opinion of the committee, petitioners including MDMK leader Vaiko impleaded in the case.

When the plea came up for hearing on Monday, MDMK leader Vaiko who impleaded in the case, appeared before the full bench and submitted reports explaining the ill effects of the trees. Recording the submissions, the bench said more material was to be relied on and ordered the state to consult with NEERI.

410,['18/02/2020'],Genderqueer struggle to get a roof over their head,"This story is from February 18, 2020

Chennai: As a transwoman, life is a daily struggle for G Oorvashi. Despite it, she has been sheltering six other gender queer women for the past few years. For homelessness is a serious issue faced by people who are assigned female at birth (AFAB). Shunned by families, they are also refused shelter in government and private homes, say members of Srishti Madurai, which has been running a helpline for genderqueer and LGBTI+ people for the past 10 years.

“Every week, we get three to five calls from AFAB women — intersex women, lesbian, and transmen — most of who are from lower middle-class families, and lower income groups,” says Gopi Shankar Madurai, founder of Srishti Madurai, an LGBTQIA+ student volunteer movement. “Most of them are looking for a place to stay and also moral support.”

Though Srishti Madurai officially launched the 24X7 helpline – +91 9092282369 – only in 2012, it has been in existence for 10 years. “Our volunteers speak Tamil and English and we also direct callers to regional volunteers who can speak Telugu, Hindi and Malayalam,” says Gopi, adding that they started the helpline as two of their own members committed suicide . “One was a transman, who was being pressurised to get married and the other a genderqueer person who was struggling to get social acceptance. That’s why ‘Just Having Someone Understanding To Talk To Can Save A Life.’ is the tagline of our helpline.”

LGBTI+ persons are often shunned by their families and some are forced to turn to sex work and begging. They also face threats from family members, landlords and neighbours. Domestic violence includes physical force, sexual violence, wrongful confinement, forced marriage, and involuntary institutionalization. “Most of the AFAB women who leave home are aged between 20 and 30 years,” says Gopi, adding that most of the people who have reached out for help are from a non-metropolitan or rural background. “Unlike transwomen , when these women leave home, they do not have an organised community structure where they can live together. Government and private hostels also do not accept them.”

Annalakshmi, 23, from Sivaganga, for instance, left home this January as she was being pressurised to get married by her family members. “I am not attracted to men and feel I may be a transman but my family members beat me up when I said I didn’t want to get married,” she says.

Once the women contact Srishti, they are given shelter. “We negotiate with house owners who are known to us personally, or we send them to our transwomen volunteers,” says Gopi. For instance, Oorvashi, 34, has been sheltering and counselling six women, and also helping them with vocational training. “Many of them are from villages, but I have managed to help four of them find jobs in Chennai,” she says.

Initially, the women are given Rs 5,000 to Rs 10,000. “We then find them employment based on their qualification or give them vocational training, stitching bags, towels etc,” says Gopi. “Since we are getting an increasing number of calls for help we are also planning to start a care home for AFAB women, which will be headed by Oorvashi. Initially, we will be hiring an independent house in Madurai, which will accommodate people from rural south India. But we need a lot of resources and we are self-funded.”

411,['18/02/2020'],9% of teen internet users face cyberbullying: Study,"This story is from February 18, 2020

New Delhi: One in every three school students who use internet suffer from negative experience , including cyberbullying, a study has claimed. According to the study conducted by Child Rights and You (CRY), around 9% of the adolescent internet users were subjected to cyberbullying but only one out of the two among them reported such incidents.

The study involved 630 students in the age group of 13-18 years from eight schools in Delhi, Noida and Faridabad. Cyberbullying involves hateful comments on online platforms or through text messages. The affected students said it caused them psychological stress and humiliation.

“I had made a meme of a friend (a boy junior to me). I had shown him wearing the ‘Superman undergarment’ and circulated it within our friends’ WhatsApp group. It was an innocent playful activity and we had a good laugh at it. Then someone posted it on Facebook and made it public by tagging that boy,” Anjana (name changed), a Class XI student, has been quoted as saying. Few days later, she added, the boy started getting “comments and threatening messages that his meme has been posted on adult sites. We all got together and deleted all our accounts and were away from social media for two months”.

Another student told surveyors how a childhood photo of a friend, a 16-year-old girl, which was posted by her father on social media, attracted needless attention and comments. “The girl still stays away from social media,” she said.

According to Soha Mitra, the regional director of CRY (North), online safety is fast emerging as an important protection aspect to the wellbeing of children and youth. “While CRY recognises the internet as a vital medium for participation and expression of children, it is the duty of parents, communities, the state and the society” to protect children and empower them to save themselves from online addiction and threats, she said.

The study’s recommendations include awareness and capacity building among children, convergence of internet safety rules and curriculum, proactive engagement of parents and caregivers, and review of existing cyber laws.

The study shows 60% of the boys and 40% of the girls have their own device while almost half of them have two or more devices to access the internet. Three in every five adolescents — 63% — said they had accepted friendship request only from known people, while the rest added friends of friends and even strangers, it adds.

The internet exposes adolescents to cybercrimes like cyberbullying, hacking and misuse of online profile, morphing of images or videos, and internet addiction, it states.

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The government will confiscate all houseboats operating without a registration and licence, while initiating stringent measures against those which do not follow rules and safety norms.

The decision was taken at a high-level meeting chaired by tourism minister Kadakampally Surendran on Monday.

As registration is mandatory for houseboats that ferry tourists in the Kerala ’s backwaters, there are many houseboats which operate under a single registration number and several others which do not have a registration, informed officials who were representatives of the department of ports.

Ports department will confiscate houseboats without registration, will deploy 15 ex-servicemen and install CCTVs for the safekeeping of confiscated boats. A decision was also taken to make bio-toilets compulsory in houseboats and also renovate the sewage treatment plants at Alappuzha and Kumarakom. Houseboats without registration will now be denied entry at boat jetties under the tourism department. Directives will be given to avoid storage of several inflammable materials in kitchen cabins of houseboats.

Fire and rescue services department will examine the quality of safety equipment and systems in each houseboat and ensure that the staff, who deal with safety, have adequate licence and wear uniforms. Besides, Kerala Institute of Tourism and Travel Studies will be entrusted to conduct a compulsory training for houseboat employees.

Among other decisions were speedy procedures for purchase of fire boats, conduct of surprise checks and ensuring GPS system in all houseboats.

Visakhapatnam: At a time when states such as Kerala, Goa and Odisha are promoting football by creating state-of-the-art infrastructure, football infrastructure in Andhra Pradesh remains in a sorry state. The state does not have a single green turf where national and international events can be organised.

There are many reasons for the sorry state of football infrastructure in the state, of which, one is official apathy. While the Andhra Pradesh Football Association (APFA) has been requesting the government to allocate grounds to APFA, nothing has been done so far.

Kosaraju Gopalakrishna, APFA president told TOI that the state needs at least four to five FIFA-approved green turfs to promote football. “The advantage of green turfs is that players don’t get hurt if they fall. While Visakhapatnam does have grounds, they are not suitable for football events. There is need to develop these grounds for football,” Gopakrishna said.

“We have approached the sports department many times and have requested them to improve the quality of playing fields in terms of the level prescribed by FIFA for professional football. But our pleas have fallen on deaf ears,” said the APFA president adding that if the government allocates a playground to APFA, the association will develop it according to FIFA standards by mobilising funds.

Meanwhile, T Anil Kumar, a football enthusiast said that not just playgrounds, there is also a dearth of qualified coaches in Andhra Pradesh. “The government is supposed to appoint coaches in all parts of the state. Visakhapatnam has produced many talented footballers who have represented clubs in West Bengal,” he said.

The ministry of youth affairs and sports had promised to develop more than 600 playgrounds in Andhra Pradesh between 2008 and 2014. But a majority of those grounds have turned into dumping yards owing to the lack of maintenance.

“The TDP government had promised a lot for sports in Andhra Pradesh, but did nothing. If the YSRC government too neglects sports, it will dent AP’s image in the sporting fraternity,” another football enthusiast said.

MADURAI: Students should use mobile phone judiciously as it can spoil their future if misused, said K Parthasarathy, vice-chancellor of Tamil Nadu Open University .

Speaking after taking part in the Art Expo organized under Happy Schooling initiative for corporation school students at Maditssia on Monday, Parthasarathy said, “Mobile phones pose a grave threat to students and are potentially the most destructive equipment in their hands if they do not know to use it judiciously.” However, he clarified that it can be the best tool for education if students use it properly.

He also lauded the creativity of students and the way they explained their output.

Corporation commissioner S Visakan said that students should always aim to achieve big in life and should not get demotivated by their present status. Many eminent people in the society were students of government and corporation schools. HCL founder Shiv Nadar is an alumnus of a school run by the Madurai Corporation , he recalled.

“Once a goal is set, the mind will start working towards it subconsciously. In today’s world, competition is high and one has to work a lot in order to achieve success. Victory is awaiting those who run the extra mile than others and those who work towards their gold when others are sleeping,” Visakan said.A large number of students participated and displayed various items they had created from waste. The three best were selected and given prizes. Happy Schooling programme is jointly implemented by the Madurai Corporation, HCL foundation and M S Chellamuthu Trust and Research Foundation .

MADURAI: While the Government of India has started taking efforts to fly the Indian crew members on board Diamond Princess back home, it is learnt that not all Indians as well as those from other countries are interested in leaving the ship ahead of the quarantine period.

One of the factors is the attractive gifts offered by the ship management such as double salary, in addition to liquor, variety of food and gifts such as clothing to keep the crew in good spirits and extend their stay in the ship. Some crew members are also worried over rumours that they should remain under poor conditions during the 14-days quarantine period in India.

The crew waiting to be taken back home have requested the government of India to help them reach home early without being detained at a faraway camp and under stringent conditions as they have already been under quarantine for so long and proved that they are not tested positive for nCoV.

The removal of mud dumped on and outside the playground.

SALIGAO: Around 100 Tivim locals gathered on the ground of the St Christopher Sports Club on Sunday demanding the removal of mud dumped on and outside the playground.

A local, Robert Colaco, had alerted villagers about the dumping, which was being carried out in a truck allegedly belonging to one pancha. He also explained how haphazard work was carried out on the ground in the name of development.

The St Christopher Sports Club, which maintains the ground, had earlier requested permission from the panchayat for undertaking repair work of the ground, slated to cost Rs 2 lakh. The panchayat, however, denied permission.

At a subsequent gram sabha , Colaco requested that a supervisory committee be formed to oversee repairs of the ground. Locals say this point was intentionally not recorded.

When questioned by the locals, Tivim sarpanch Sandeep Kauthankar and panchas present, Sandeep Khaunthankar, Shivadas Kambli, Michael Fernandes and Arjun Aroskar, were unable to reply about which scheme work on the ground was being carried out under or who was funding the project. The villagers also questioned the panchayat members as to what the difficulty was, in forming the committee.

MANGALURU: The sixth additional district and sessions court judge Sayeedunnisa on Monday sentenced Cyanide Mohan to life imprisonment for the murder of a woman from Kasaragod. This is the 19th case that in which he is being held guilty.

Public prosecutor Jayarama Shetty told TOI that the 23-year-old victim, who rolled beedis for a livelihood, had gone missing from her house on January 3, 2006. The two met at a wedding and he introduced himself as Mohan Kumar, a teacher from Vittal.

He then asked her to go to the toilet in the bus stand and take it.

Police constable Basavaraj from Lashkar police station found her lying in the toilet. She was declared brought dead at the hospital.

419,['18/02/2020'],Govt to fly home Indian crew on board quarantined ship,"This story is from February 18, 2020

ON WAVES OF FEAR

MADURAI: The Indian embassy in Tokyo has informed Indian crew on board cruise ship Diamond Princess that those interested in leaving the ship before the end of their mandatory 14-day quarantine period can opt for the same by filling the form sent to them by email on Monday afternoon (Japan time). They are likely to be flown back home in a chartered flight. This has given a sigh of relief for the crew on board the ship that has been quarantined off the Yokohama port in Japan since the beginning of this month.

Around 3 pm (Japanese time), a few of the Indian crew received mails titled ‘Urgent’ from the embassy stating that it was a message to all the Indian crew members and that it was to facilitate their travel to India. Asking for their willingness to leave the ship before the expiry of the mandatory quarantine requirements, they were also asked whether they would like to avail travel by a chartered flight.

It stated that boarding the proposed chartered flight will be subject to the body temperature of the individual being normal at the time of disembarkation/boarding. The form made it clear that those who opt to leave the ship will be put under ‘mandatory quarantine of 14 days’ at government designated place(s). On refusing to the above, they will remain under quarantine on board Diamond Princess in accordance with Japanese regulations.

Nearly 150 Indian crew members, including five from Tamil Nadu are on board the ship. They have been identified as Anbalagan from Madurai, Muthu from Trichy, Daniel from Chengalpattu, Dhamodharan from Tuticorin district and Jayaraj from Coimbatore. Jayaraj is with the security department and the four others are chefs. It is learnt that all the five are not infected till Monday.

“At least four Tamils have expressed their willingness to prematurely end the quarantine and fly back to India. We thought that the passengers as well as the crew have a simultaneous quarantine. But we were wrong. Now we have understood that February 19 is the end of the quarantine period for the passengers and that the 14-days quarantine for crew will begin only after that,” Anbalagan said.

The form asked the crew members to reply not later than 12 pm (Japan time) on Tuesday (February 18). Thanking the government for taking efforts to bring them back, the crew also said that the letter was not sent to all the Indian crew members. They suggested that the authorities could have made an announcement in the ship and circulated the forms to all the crew members.

The crew members did not waste time as they filled the forms with details such as their passport numbers and sent it back to the embassy, after which the embassy officials got in touch with them over phone for a confirmation. The main reason for opting for the same is that the ship is still infected and it is unsafe to stay further.

Decision on the mode of transportation of the crew to India would be taken based on the number of applications they receive till Tuesday.

Nagpur: ‘Magna Talyakathee’, a play by legend Mahesh Elkunchwar and directed by Venkatesh S Naik, was staged at the 21st Bharat Rang Mahotsav. The second part of the trilogy by eminent playwright Elkunchwar, ‘Magna Talyakathee’ is a family drama linked to ‘Wada Chirebandi’, the first part of the play.

Set in rural Vidarbha, the play is about relationships, aspirations, joy, sorrow, anger, insecurities and many other human emotions.

While a few things improve, many disintegrate, irrevocably. Reference to caste, apart from prejudice between two Brahmin sub-castes, a grain crisis and urbanization are the subjects of the hapless protagonists.

The expressions and the typical Marathi lingo were beautifully presented by the performers. Every line reflected the Maharashtrian culture and lifestyle of Vidarbha. The play was about a traditional joint family which makes challenging adjustments due to modernization.

The play highlights the three generations of Dharangaonkar Deshpande and the struggle of every family member. In the first play ‘Wada Chirebandi’, the hardships of the family are shown, including 10 years later, when the children grow up.

Bhaskar’s sons, Parag and Ranju, are about to get married when his younger brother Sudhir, along with his wife Anjali and son Abhay, who studies in America, return to the wada.

While Parag envies his cousin Abhay because he could not pursue his own education in Mumbai, Anjali feels her son will become a victim of the backward environment. Parag is not the most loved person in the village because he is in a relationship with a widow.

With time, Parag’s anger disappears and he bonds with Abhay, remembering their childhood days and finally, there’s peace in the household.

Parag and Abhay go back to their childhood spot, a pond where they used to spend hours gazing at the stars. Ranju, Parag’s sister, had eloped with her teacher 10 years ago and is still taunted and hated by her brother and family members.

In between the problems of the family, the soft and bubbly character of Ranju adds life to the play, making it a visual treat for the audience.

It was the concluding play of the weeklong Rang Mahotsav. The play was presented by Kala Academy, Goa.

Gandhinagar: India will launch a marine turtle and marine stranding management policy in 2020, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on Monday. Addressing the inaugural session of the 13th Conference of Parties (COP) to the Convention on Migratory Species (CMS) in Gandhinagar via a video link, Modi said that single-use plastics have been a challenge in environment protection. He said Indians are urgently striving to reduce its usage. He said that the policy will also deal with the pollution caused by micro-plastics in oceans.

India proposes to strengthen its association with Asean and East Asia Summit countries, Modi said. He said the move will be in sync with the Indo Pacific Ocean Initiative (IPOI), in which India will play a leadership role.

Several protected areas in India share boundaries with protected areas of neighbouring countries. “Cooperation in conservation of wildlife through the establishment of ‘trans-boundary protected areas’ will lead to positive outcomes,” Modi said. India is a part of the Central Asian Flyway for migratory birds. “To conserve birds along the flyway and in their habitats, India has prepared a national action plan,” Modi said. “India will be happy to facilitate the preparation of action plans for other countries.” India will hold the presidency of the COP-CMS for the coming three years.

Highlighting one of India’s green achievements, Modi said that the country’s forest cover has increased significantly. The present assessment indicates that the forest cover is 21.67% of the total geographical area of the country, he added.

As for the 13th Conference of Parties event, its theme is ‘Migratory species connect the planet and together we welcome them home’. “Gujarat is an important migratory flyway,” said Gujarat chief minister Vijay Rupani at the inaugural function. “The Indian philosophy of ‘Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam’ — the world is one family — gels well with the theme. And we welcome all our guests by saying, “Atithi Devo Bhav”, or guest is God.”

Another part of the inaugural programme was the release of “My Stamp”, personalized sheets of postage stamps of India Post. Union environment minister Prakash Javdekar released the stamp. Personalization is achieved by printing a thumbnail image on a selected template. “Dharti bula rahi hai”, a song specially penned for the occasion by Prasoon Joshi and sung by minister of state for environment Babul Surpriyo, was also released in the inauguration session.

422,['18/02/2020'],Gujarat GIBs to get males from Rajasthan: Centre,"Caption

Gandhinagar: With the last male Great Indian bustard ( GIB ) gone missing from the state for over one year now, the ministry of forest, environment and climate change (MoEFCC) has decided to push for translocation of a couple of male GIBs from Rajasthan to Gujarat.Soumitra Dasgupta, additional director general of forests (Wildlife), MoEFCC in an interaction with TOI said that the MoEFCC is aware that there are no surviving males left in Gujarat and hence the GIB population has reduced to less than seven in the state.“We, as a part of the long-term conservation of great Indian bustards have decided to introduce a GIB male from Rajasthan. The ministry is coordinating with both the state governments and soon a meeting will be held to finalize the modalities.”Dasgupta said that the in situ breeding programme in Rajasthan was not just for one state but it was for all states with GIBs including Rajasthan, Gujarat, Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh,and even Karnataka where 12 GIBs have been spotted along with three chicks recently. The Karnataka government was asked to join the project, and they too have joined it.“As a part of the long-term project, the MoEFCC will steps up efforts to get the male from Gujarat,” he said.About two years ago, Vasundhara Raje who was the then chief minister of Rajasthan had refused to give GIB eggs to Gujarat for in situ breeding programme after which the MoEFCC and the Wildlife Institute of India shifted the breeding centre from Gujarat to Rajasthan. In August 2019, Rajasthan forest and environment minister Sukhram Vishnoi had said, “Even if the Gujarat government sends a proposal for getting a male from Rajasthan, it will be difficult to catch a male GIB and transport it to Gujarat. The Gujarat government should in fact catch all its female GIBs and send them to Rajasthan. Rajasthan has already set up a breeding centre with the help from Wildlife Institute of India (WII) and Abu Dhabi.""A WII expert associated with the captive breeding centre in Rajasthan, said, “Sending a couple of male GIBs to Gujarat may not be a fruitful move as Gujarat has not addressed the principal issue, the overhead high-tension power lines in the GIB habitat. We want Gujarat to move all the high-tension lines underground or sending a male GIB will not serve any purpose. We are told that Gujarat government has even decided to have it own breeding centre where they intend to catch female GIBs from Kutch Bustard Sanctuary (in Naliya) and breed with the Rajasthan males.”Officials in the Gujarat forest department said that after the GIB population in the state fell to 20, it was proposed that the high-tension power lines be moved underground, but the state government has been dragging its feet. Even now, with no males left, the government has not addressed the issue.However, Dasgupta said, “The ministry has asked the power distribution companies to take high-tension lines in the country including those in GIB areas underground for 33kV lines but for 66kV transmission lines the companies were reluctant, as it was a very costly affair. We can only recommend or suggest such steps, but we cannot force any one to take power lines underground.”",ahmedabad,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-47529300,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-110164,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/gujarat-gibs-to-get-males-from-rajasthan-centre/articleshow/74182633.cms

KOLKATA: After a crowded weekend, truncated services of East-West Metro saw a thinner crowd on the first day of the week. While the number of joyriders, who had kept trains full since the commencement of the service on February 14, came down sharply, it was time for office-goers to take over. But the ticket counters didn’t see long queues on Monday morning.The crowd grew as the day progressed, though. The Sector V and Salt Lake Stadium stations saw a reasonable turnout in the afternoon. Unlike the first weekend, joyriders were replaced with those who availed the services to commute to work or for convenience. Calcutta State Transport Corporation employee Mrinal Das took a train to the Salt Lake Stadium station en route to work. Das said it was convenient for him. “It is getting warmer and I would prefer to avoid commuting in buses, which are crowded anyway. I plan to take an AC bus from Salt Lake Stadium, which is also cheaper for me,” said Das.Librarian Priyanka Naskar, a Sector V employee, walked into the swank, new Metro station on her way to Phoolbagan. It was her first ride since she had avoided the weekend crowd. “I am not for joyrides but the Metro will be extremely useful for me. I will be using it daily now. Everything about the East-West Metro is nice and perfect,” she said.Private hospital executive Tanmay Sil rued that the Metro services begin a little too late for him to be able to take a train to work. But he has decided to use it on the way back from work. “Since I stay at Sector V, I will be getting down at the station and walk home. It’s a pleasure to ride this Metro and I feel really proud as a Kolkatan,” Sil said.It could get crowded as the week progresses since many are still figuring out how to use the new Metro to commute to work, felt those at the ticket counters. “This is still a truncated service and the first day of the week. The crowd should swell towards the middle of the week,” said a Metro employee.

Kolkata: After a crowded weekend, truncated services of East-West Metro saw a thinner crowd on the first day of the week. While the number of joyriders, who had kept trains full since the commencement of the service on February 14, came down sharply, it was time for office-goers to take over. But the ticket counters didn’t see long queues on Monday morning.

The crowd grew as the day progressed, though. The Sector V and Salt Lake Stadium stations saw a reasonable turnout in the afternoon. Unlike the first weekend, joyriders were replaced with those who availed the services to commute to work or for convenience. Calcutta State Transport Corporation employee Mrinal Das took a train to the Salt Lake Stadium station en route to work. Das said it was convenient for him. “It is getting warmer and I would prefer to avoid commuting in buses, which are crowded anyway. I plan to take an AC bus from Salt Lake Stadium, which is also cheaper for me,” said Das.

Librarian Priyanka Naskar, a Sector V employee, walked into the swank, new Metro station on her way to Phoolbagan. It was her first ride since she had avoided the weekend crowd. “I am not for joyrides but the Metro will be extremely useful for me. I will be using it daily now. Everything about the East-West Metro is nice and perfect,” she said.

Private hospital executive Tanmay Sil rued that the Metro services begin a little too late for him to be able to take a train to work. But he has decided to use it on the way back from work. “Since I stay at Sector V, I will be getting down at the station and walk home. It’s a pleasure to ride this Metro and I feel really proud as a Kolkatan,” Sil said.

It could get crowded as the week progresses since many are still figuring out how to use the new Metro to commute to work, felt those at the ticket counters. “This is still a truncated service and the first day of the week. The crowd should swell towards the middle of the week,” said a Metro employee. It will indeed change the way people in the north-eastern part of the city travel, said state government employee Taj Ahmed. “My office is at Phoolbagan and commuting to work has suddenly become very easy and comfortable for me. And what’s more, the Metro is also faster and cheaper. I couldn’t have asked for more,” said Ahmed.

KOLKATA: The state fire services department has made it mandatory for all new high-rises, which are above 45 metres in height or has a floor area of more than 2 lakh square feet, to install a fully functional fire-service kiosk within the premises. The rule will also be applicable for education institutions equipped with air-conditioning, basement parking and having an auditorium with a capacity of more than 500 people.While inaugurating a fire-service kiosk at Acropolis Mall in south Kolkata on Monday, director general of fire services Jag Mohan stressed on the need of such kiosks at all major highrises. “We are already giving recommendation for all buildings that are 45m tall and wherever there is a steady footfall. We are issuing this recommendation for quite a few months now. For all the new buildings that are coming up, this clause is included in the fire-safety recommendation. For the existing buildings, the law cannot be applied retrospectively but we are asking them too to set up the kiosks on their premises,” he said.As per the new order, the department is recommending a dedicated kiosk measuring about 100ftX125ft area, preferably located on the ground floor, to be clubbed together with other service areas like security room, fire control room and reception with clear and easy access.“We have seen that during an emergency, local residents and club members are the first to respond and start rescuing people from a fire-trapped place. They often do not have requisite tools, thus hampering the initial fire-fighting process. The fire-service kiosk needs to be equipped with some basic fire-safety tools that are available in a firetender,” Jag Mohan added.The kiosk inaugurated at the mall on Monday has CO2 extinguishers, ABC-type extinguishers, ceiling hook, lock cutter, hammer, crowbar, insulated axe, stretcher, smoke hood, torchlight and sand buckets, in addition to inbuilt fire suppression and detection system.Real estate developers have welcomed the move. Nandu Belani, president of the Bengal chapter of Confederation of Real Estate Developers Association of India (Credai-Bengal), said the idea was good as it would give everyone access critical equipment in case of a fire. “No builder will have a problem investing space or resources,” he said.Yashasvi Shroff, director of Alcove Realty, one of the developers in the consortium that built The 42, the tallest building in Kolkata, agreed that nothing was more important or valuable to a builder than life of people inhabiting in a building. “Now all major builders take care of the statutory requirements and take fire-fighting seriously. We will also implement the new rule,” he said.Merlin Group chairman Sushil Mohta said they were even planning to conduct a fire drill for local club members with the councillor’s help to prepare everyone for any emergency situation.",kolkata,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74188646,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-325967,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/fire-kiosks-a-must-for-new-high-rises/articleshow/74181650.cms

MALAPPURAM: The stream in Kavalappara village that almost disappeared after a massive landslide in August last year, will soon get a rebirth through the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme ( MNREGS ).

The stream was a major source of water for hundreds of families in Kavalappara and adjacent villages in Pothukallu grama panchayat. After the landslide, which engulfed the village, the stream turned to narrow brooks and rills in many areas and it also diverted its course in some other areas.

In a fresh effort, local bodies in the region are all set to revamp the waterbody through MNREGS works with the support of technical experts and scientists. The stream would be restored in the area by carrying out widening works. Protection wall would be constructed on both sides of the stream as part of the renovation works. Geo-textiles would be used for preventing the soil erosion. The works are expected to be completed before monsoon.

The project is being implemented jointly by Nilambur block panchayat, Pothukallu grama panchayat and district mission of MNREGS. As part of implementation of the project, accredited engineers of Nilambur block panchayat and Vandur and Kalikavu grama panchayats visited the spot on Sunday. They granted a preliminary-level technical sanction for the first phase of renovation works.

Block panchayat president of Nilambr, P P Sugathan, joint programme coordinator of MNREGS P Abdul Azees, block development officer of Nilambur C Rajeev also accompanied the team.

Meanwhile, an emergency meeting convened at Pothukallu grama panchayat on Monday granted approval for the estimate of the first phase of the project.

NEW DELHI: A group of 154 eminent citizens — comprising former high court judges, ex-bureaucrats, armed forces veterans and academicians — on Monday wrote to the President of India expressing their concern at the “vicious” campaign and “fear-mongering” by “vested groups” against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, upcoming National Population Register (NPR) exercise and the idea of a National Register of Citizens (NRC).

In the letter — signed by 11 former judges of different high courts, 24 retired IAS officers, 11 ex-IFS officers, 16 former IPS officers and 18 former Lieutenant Generals — the citizens urged the government to look into the ongoing protests against CAA/NRC “with all seriousness” and safeguard the democratic institutions by taking stern action against the vested interests behind them. They even alleged that the protests were designed to destroy the fabric of the country and harm the nation’s unity and integrity. “We strongly feel that there is also an external dimension to the disturbances being created,” they said .

The citizens — which include former Chief Justice of Sikkim high court Justice Permod Kohli , former defence secretary Yogendra Narain, former RAW chief Sanjeev Kumar Tripathi , former Kerala chief secretary C V Anand Bose , former Kerala DGP R Padmanabhan and Puducherry University vice-chancellor Gurmeet Singh — said the campaign based on a “false and nefarious narrative” about CAA, NPR and NRC was being run in a “coordinated manner” leading to violent protests.

They defended CAA saying that it was a law passed by Parliament and did not apply to Indian citizens at all. On NPR, they said it was a legal obligation. As for NRC, the citizens stressed that it was an absolute necessity for a country to maintain such a register for its security safety and well being.

430,['18/02/2020'],Govt to replicate KC Valley scheme in Tier-2 cities,"This story is from February 18, 2020

Bengaluru: Buyoed by the success of diverting treated sewage water from Bengaluru to irrigate parched fields in Chikkaballapura and Kolar districts, the state government will replicate the scheme in other major cities of the state.

A first in the country, the treated water project was commissioned in 2018 and implemented at a cost of Rs 1,400 crore. Now, water from Bengaluru fills over 130 tanks in the two districts.

Governor Vajubhai R Vala, in his address to the joint-sitting of the legislature, said, ""Secondary treated waste water from Bengaluru is being used to fill tanks in drought-prone districts of Chikkaballapura and Kolar. My government intends to implement this scheme in other important cities,"" Vala said.

On security, Vala said an anti-terror unit has been set up exclusively for Bengaluru and an emergency response support system (ERSS) rolled out with the Centre’s assistance to cater to citizens in emergencies. A high-security prison is being constructed in Parappana Agrahara, Bengaluru, to house hardcore criminals and terrorists, while central prisons are being constructed in Vijayapura and Bidar, he said.

Contrary to expectations, Vala did not mention implementation of the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA). The opposition was reportedly planning to disrupt the governor’s address in case he made a reference to CAA.

Vala also defended the government’s management of natural calamities, outlined its priorities especially the irrigation sector and complimented it for prudent management of finances. In his 30-minute speech, he hailed efforts of the government in providing relief to flood victims, helping farmers with additional assistance and maintaining financial prudence. ""My government undertook rescue and relief operations in flood-hit areas on a war footing,"" he said

While the government spent Rs 827 crore on rebuilding and repairing damaged houses, Rs 207 crore was spent on compensation for loss of clothing, utensils and other household goods. The government also paid Rs 1,126 crore towards input subsidy at Rs 10,000 per hectare. ""In addition, the government also released Rs 2,104 crore for restoration of critical infrastructure,"" the governor said.

The governor also said special watershed development programmes will be rolled out to prevent drought in 100 taluks by combining rural employment guarantee scheme and PM Krishi Sichayi Yojana. Claiming Karnataka stood at No 1 position in the country with respect to reduction of maternal deaths, the governor said over 3.3 lakh beneficiaries availed benefit of the Ayushman Bharat-Arogya Karnataka since July 2019.

The government also plans to increase the number of women in the police force by 5%. Vala said the government has approved reservation of 25% posts — up from 20% — of constable and sub-inspector posts for women.

Darjeeling: Hawkers who were removed from Nehru Road near Chowrasta in Darjeeling were rehabilitated along the Hill Cart Road on Monday. They can now set up temporary stalls at the Motor Stand area in the heart of the town after 5pm. A total of 40 stalls will be allowed for the time being.

Last year, Darjeeling Municipality had removed hawkers selling tea, momo, puchka, chowmein, balloons and ice-cream from Nehru Road. Stalls of nearly 180 hawkers, who had temporary stalls near Chowrasta and Mall Road, were pulled down. The civic authorities on Monday allowed 40 of them to relocate. The others will be rehabilitated as well, a source said. Before they were removed, hawkers on Nehru Road kept shops open from 4pm to 9pm every day.

Those who were evicted from Nehru Road last year had termed the move “illegal”. They claimed that under the Street Vendors (Protection of Livelihood and Regulation of Street Vending) Act, 2016, there is no provision for eviction and protection of livelihood is a priority. They decided to open the shops again from 4pm. Following the stir, civic authorities held a number of meetings to reach an amicable solution.

“We are thankful to the administration for allowing us to reopen shops after months. Hawkers had to go through a harrowing time since it was a matter of their livelihood. Now we have been allocated a place and we no longer must remain in fear that we will be removed,” said Darjeeling District Hawkers Union president Kundan Dewan. The vendors, who had been removed, were members of the union. The union had later sought intervention of the National Hawkers Federation (NHF) which had attended the meetings with the civic authorities.

“They have been allowed to open their stalls — only after 5pm — on humanitarian basis. We have also kept a condition that they should keep the area clean,” said an official with the municipality. Hawkers have been asked to collect garbage after business hours and dump it in huge moveable dustbin provided by the civic body.

PANAJI: The risk that speed breakers without signage pose to motorists was one of the main grievances raised by participants during a round table discussion on youth and road safety held on Monday.

Students and representatives of various educational institutions highlighted not only the need for signage about speed breakers, but also the need for some standardisation.

Recently, citizens under the campaign ‘ Rosto ’ put the government to shame by painting speed breakers.

Goa Consumer Action Network convener Roland Martins said that some speed breakers are illegal as they are not government notified. Notified speed breakers must be accompanied by required signboards, he said.

Besides illegal speed breakers, Martins also educated the students about illegal bus stops, warning them that in the case of an accident while either climbing or alighting at an unauthorised stop, their case will not stand in the court of law.

On complaints of lack of shuttle buses from Margao to Panaji during peak hours in the morning emerged, Martins advised them to send in written complaints.

One participant said the rent-a-bikes and cars contribute to the traffic chaos.

KOCHI: The Travancore Cochin Medical Council ( TCMC ) has decided to remove the name of an MBBS doctor who prescribed “sweets for diabetic patients” from its register for three months.

During the period of removal from the register he is not be eligible to practise medicine, consult patients, prescribe medicines or any other activities done by a doctor.

TCMC members discussed the issue and after referring to the detailed investigation conducted on the issue concluded that the doctor had indulged in professional misconduct. An order to this effect was issued on February 17.

“The council in its meeting held on Jan 10, 2020 endorses the views of the ethics committee that Dr M V Prasad is guilty of misconduct and for the proved charges of unethical advertisement and also unethical, unscientific practice without scientific evidence for this method of treatment,” the order signed by TCMC registrar states.

The order further states that Dr Prasad has been giving “unethical” advertisement —“Eat Sugar Avoid Medicine”— to diabetic patients despite being strictly warned by TCMC in the past. Dr Prasad had contended before the council that he had not violated any provisions in the code of ethics and the advertisement was made without his knowledge and he had asked people to stop such advertisements.

Since the ethics committee didn’t find the explanation satisfactory, they recommended the council to take disciplinary action for removal of Dr Prasad’s name from the register for three months. Accordingly, a notice was issued to him.

While diabetologists warn against sugar consumption and lifestyle changes by diabetes patients, Dr Prasad who practises in Wayanad , has claimed that intake of normal food without any restriction and moderate servings of sweets and exercise to burn out extra calories is all that is needed to control diabetes.

Nagpur: Certified Google news trainer Ankita Deshkar explained the importance of fact checking to avoid ‘misinformation’, ‘disinformation’ and ‘malinformation’ which generally result in the spread of rumours, in a workshop on ‘How to identity fake news by using simple online tips’, held on Saturday. The workshop was conducted at Blind Relief Association’s Mundle Hall.

“Misinformation happens unintentionally, whereas disinformation is fabricated or deliberately manipulated via audio or video content. Malinformation is deliberate publication of private information for personal or corporate gains and not really in the interest of the public,” said Deshkar.

The International Federation of Library Association and Institution (IFLA) has come up with various ways to know whether news posted online is factual or fake.

“It has been observed that people forward news based on just headlines. Pictures and videos are being doctored and manipulated, thereby putting a question mark regarding the credibility of the content,” she said.

Google search can be used in many ways that are unknown to the common man. Factual of fake status of photographs or videos can be known through this device. Google provides a feature for picture search which can give precise information. One can gain access to this service via images.google.com

Apart from Google, other search engines like Yandex, Baidu, Tineye and Revere, too, are credible.

“A little effort is needed as one needs to key in words in Google search to get accurate information instead of banking on news that’s forwarded and fake,” said Deshkar.

After her presentation, Deshkar engaged is an interactive session with the audience to clear their doubts.

The Reserve Bank of India

PANAJI: The Reserve Bank of India ( RBI ) has extended the financial sanctions imposed on the Mapusa Urban Cooperative Bank (MUCB) since July 2015 for two more months even as the bank continues to explore its dwindling options to revive its fortunes.

The apex bank had extended its embargo on lending and withdrawal for three months, up to February 18, and depositors had feared that the bank would go into liquidation.

“RBI has not relaxed any conditions. They have extended the restrictions for another two months,” general manager of MUCB Sailendra Sawant said.

The RBI extension will come as a relief to the MUCB management which is facing the ire of depositors and shareholders.

Even though the state government has made it clear that it is unable to infuse any share capital into the beleaguered bank, the management is counting on the state government to bail it out.

“Our position is not so bad, asset wise, that the bank needs to be liquidated,” Sawant said. One option that the state is exploring is a merger or consolidation with local cooperative banks.

Under the Section 35A of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949, the apex bank has directed MUCB not to grant or renew any loans and advances, make any investment or accept fresh deposits.

It may be recalled that MUCB’s finances came under strain after RBI imposed certain curbs on its financial transactions in 2014.

MUCB has 24 branches in the state besides the head office in Mapusa, and 193 staff members in all. Besides, the bank has 1.19 lakh shareholders and 2.48 lakh depositors.

439,['18/02/2020'],S corpn may collect garbage charges with property tax,"This story is from February 18, 2020

New Delhi: With the levying of user charges for garbage collection back on the agenda, South Delhi Municipal Corporation ( SDMC ) may collect it along with property taxes.

The SDMC commissioner has directed the property tax department to consider the proposal for incentivising the tax payers if they make a one-time annual payment of user charges along with the property tax.

Confirming that the proposal is under consideration, a senior official said, “The user charges cannot be legally added to property taxes but we are trying to incentivise their one-time payment.” While a Geospatial Delhi Limited survey says SDMC’s four zones have around 14 lakh households, the municipal data reveals 4.5-5 lakh of these houses pay property taxes.

The user charges were approved by the court in February 2018. For residential areas, these are expected to vary between Rs 50 and Rs 200 per month, depending upon the plot area. While residential dwellings up to 50sq m will be charged Rs 50 every month, those between 50 and 200sq m will have to pay Rs 100 and all units above 200sq m Rs 200 per month, the highest slab in the residential category, said a senior official of the sanitation department, citing a notification.

Similarly, the street vendors will be charged Rs 100 and commercial establishments like shops, eating places, dhabas and sweet shops Rs 500. For larger commercial units, falling under the bulk garbage generator category, the monthly charges are likely to vary between Rs 2,000 and Rs 5,000.

While the charges for unstarred hotels will be Rs 2,000, it will be Rs 3,000 for those up to the three-star category and Rs 5,000 above that, the official explained. Party lawns, Banquet halls, big godowns and cold storage facilities will also be charged Rs 5,000.

North Delhi Municipal Corporation is also finalising its procedure to levy user charges for garbage collection.

AAP had opposed the idea last time.

MADURAI: The vice-chancellor (VC) of Madurai Kamaraj University ( MKU ), M Krishnan has issued two separate charge memos to the controller of examination (CoE), O Ravi seeking explanation regarding two incidents that raised questions of wrongdoing in the latter’s office.

On January 23, an unauthorised official from a distance education centre accessed the consolidated mark sheets of various centres in the office of the CoE. The VC had acted on a tip-off, nabbing the person in the act. “A charge memo was issued last week regarding this, seeking explanation about how the official managed to get in and in what capacity,” he said.

On Monday, a second memo was issued seeking explanation for the case of exam answer papers that had been lost and found. On February 6, when results of the exam conducted in November 2019 were supposed to be announced, the VC received information that a bundle carrying 138 exam answer papers had gone missing.

Later, on February 10, the staff found the missing answer papers under the seat of a bus, which is used to collect the papers. “The second memo was issued seeking explanation as to why the issue of the missing papers was reported only during the time of announcing results and was not brought to the attention of higher authorities earlier,” explained the VC.

Earlier, I Ismail, general secretary of the MKU Principals’ Association, had sought the suspension of the CoE and a directorate of vigilance and anti-corruption (DVAC) probe for allegedly collecting Rs 3 crore bribe from various distance education centre coordinators in Tamil Nadu and other states by distributing consolidated mark statements without collecting fees dues to the university.

Former revenue minister Rohan Khaunte

PANAJI: Former revenue minister Rohan Khaunte ’s pet project, a Revenue Bhavan for Porvorim constituency, has been put in cold storage, at least for now. The government said the project, proposed to be set-up on an area of 3,800 sqm, is not possible due to non-availability of land.

Khaunte pursued the project until he was removed from the cabinet in July 2019, an official said.

The former minister had caused eyebrows to be raised when he tried to get the project constructed through the Info Tech Corporation, which was under his IT ministry. Government department projects are normally carried out through either the PWD or Goa State Infrastructure Development Corporation (GSIDC).

“Questions were certainly raised as he wanted the project to be constructed through the IT corporation,” an official said. The project proposal remained pending with the finance department for a while, he said.

The project was proposed to be setup in the village panchayat of Penha de Franca and part of the area was purchased from the Goa Housing Board for Rs 9.7 crore.

The balance 1,030sqm was proposed to be transferred from the general administration department (GAD) to the revenue department. However, the government didn’t approve the transfer.

Revenue minister Jennifer Monserrate in her written reply to Goa legislative assembly, in the budget session held earlier this month, gave reasons for the delay as “due to non-availability of total area (3,800sqm), the construction cannot be processed.”

The work of building a Revenue Bhavan in Mapusa has been delayed as statutory approvals from North Goa Planning and Development Authority (NGPDA) are yet to be received. The delay is also on account of obtaining a NOC from directorate of health services. The work was tendered in August 2019 and while technical bids were opened, financial bids were not as statutory approval from NGPDA, construction licence were not obtained.

The proposed flyover will run parallel to the Metro viaduct

KOLKATA: KMDA will finalize the alignment of the proposed flyover from Chingrighata to New Town in a week or two for placing the proposal to the board for approval. The project was discussed in the government’s infrastructure sub-committee meeting on Monday.

IIT-Kharagpur has been engaged to prepare a study to assess the traffic scenario of Chingrighata crossing on EM Bypass and to come up with the most feasible layout.

Earlier, it was proposed that a flyover will be set up over the wetland but the plan was scrapped and the authorities came up with a few alternative alignments, in which a flyover had been proposed from Captain Bheri on EM Bypass, which will take right from Chingrighata to move over Salt Lake Bypass — parallel to the Metro alignment — before entering Sector V from Nicco Park.

“As per the proposed alignment, the flyover seems to just move past a few waterbodies behind Sector V before entering New Town. The proposed alignment will be finalised by looking into the best possible options so that no waterbody gets affected,” said an official.

Once the authorities come up with the final alignment, a detail project report will be prepared and an environment impact assessment will be done.

Nagpur: IAS officer of 2008 batch Abhijit Bangar has been posted as director, Textiles, here. He was without charge after being replaced by Tukaram Mundhe from the post of municipal commissioner at the Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) since January 28.

The state government on Tuesday issued a notification shuffling 21 IAS officials, including Bangar. He replaced Madhavi Khode-Chaure. The government has transferred Khode to Jalgaon Municipal Corporation as municipal commissioner.

The government had transferred Bangar within 14 months from the NMC despite tenure of 36 months. He was transferred to make way for Mundhe.

During his 14-month tenure, Bangar used to meet people whenever present in his cabin and never fixed any time table for visitors. Bangar had successfully revised door-to-door garbage collection system, improved city’s ranking under Swachh Bharat Mission, took city to top post under Smart City Mission, tackled water crisis very well last year and expedited various developmental projects.

Among the other transfers, Devendra Singh has been appointed as collector of Yavatmal.

MADURAI: Following a bountiful harvest after nearly a decade, the villagers of an agrarian hamlet in Sivaganga have decided to make the best out of it. When traders who approached them offered low price for their produce, they decided to brand the rice they have cultivated in their village as ‘Veppankulam brand’ and market it by themselves. This has resulted in the tiny village attracting the attention of the district administration and now they have become a community that is helping farmers in more than one way. Veppankulam , a tiny rain fed village near Kallal in Sivaganga district , had its fields green and lush this year after many years. The drought had made the villagers revive and desilt their tanks. Last year’s rain had filled most of the tanks and the farmers were able to cultivate paddy successfully.

However, the traders offered only Rs 850 for a 66 kg bag of paddy. This was pittance and would not help the farmers in any way. The villagers came together and decided to process their own paddy under the brand name and sell it in their village. “We fixed the price at Rs 1,100 per bag, and told the villagers that they could get a month’s supply of rice cheaper than the market rate if they pay and book in advance,” said R Thiruchelvam, a villager.

The advance bookings helped them procure 300 bags of rice from farmers and they started processing it. Sivaganga district collector J Jayakanthan, who was impressed on hearing the initiative, asked the Civil Supplies Corporation to start a paddy procurement centre in the village. On February 7, a centre was inaugurated in the village for the first time. As the government was paying Rs 1,070 for a bag of paddy, the villagers stopped their procurement as the farmers started getting a good deal from the government. Now, the paddy procurement centre is helping many farmers from the neighbouring villages, and about 40 of them come to their village to drop their produce at the centre. The women of the village now started distributing citron juice with jaggery and salt to the farmers who wait for many hours to give away their paddy at the procurement centre. Thangavelu, a farmer, says that this is the first village in the region where they really get an energizing juice free of cost. “Citron juice is an excellent cooler and full of nutrition and what the women are doing is a noble thing,” he said.

A common Chettinad food, Kallathu dosa, is also sold by women who have established a shop near procurement centre, at a very nominal cost. This is benefitting the farmers and workers at procurement centre.

445,['18/02/2020'],"Laxman Savadi wins council seat, remains deputy chief minister of Karnataka","This story is from February 18, 2020

Laxman Savadi

BENGALURU: Deputy chief minister Laxman Savadi was elected to the legislative council on Monday and although it was a done deal that he would win, a vote from across the aisle spiced up the election.

Counting was conducted soon after ballots were cast and Savadi polled 113 of the 120 votes cast, including the vote of disgruntled JD(S) legislator GT Devegowda. Seven votes were declared invalid. Members of the two opposition parties — Congress and JD(S) — abstained from voting.

The election was necessitated following the resignation of Rizwan Arshad of the Congress. Rizwan resigned after he was elected to the legislative assembly from the Shivajinagar constituency in the assembly bypolls held for 15 seats in December last year.

BR Anil Kumar, who was initially promised the support of both Congress and JD(S) was supposed to contest as an independent candidate. However, as both parties refused to support him at the last minute, he withdrew, paving the way for Savadi’s victory.

The BJP has 117 members in the 225-member assembly, but N Mahesh of the BSP and two independents, H Nagesh and Sharath Bachchegowda, besides GT Devegowda also voted, taking the total electorate to 120 (including the speaker). BJP’s SA Ramadas did not turn up because of health reasons.

“I would like to thank all those who were responsible for my victory. Special thanks to leaders of my party and chief minister BS Yediyurappa, who gave me the opportunity to be the BJP candidate,” said Savadi.

Winning this council election was crucial for Savadi to retain his ministry as he was not an elected member of either of the houses. Rules mandate that a non-member must get elected either to the assembly or council within six months after taking over as minister. February 20 was the deadline for Savadi, who had lost 2018 assembly polls from Athani, to get elected.

Officials in the assembly secretariat said seven votes were invalid because voters had wrongly marked their choices on ballot paper. According to norms, a voter has to mark numerical one, two and three against the names of the candidates in order of preference. Marking only numerical one is allowed. However, six ballots had a tick mark, while a voter had registered a cross mark. Since it was a secret ballot, it was not known who the MLAs were whose votes were invalid.

“The ballot papers bear serial numbers and they are randomly distributed. It is virtually impossible to say who a voter cast his or her vote for,” said assembly secretary MK Vishalakashi, the retuning officer for the bypoll.

446,['18/02/2020'],No action to be taken against five Pondy govt officials: CBI,"This story is from February 18, 2020

Puducherry: Chief minister V Narayanasamy said the CBI director has written to the government conveying that ‘no action is contemplated’ against officials of the Centralized admission committee ( Centac ) in a case probed by the investigation agency into corruption in the MBBS admission in private colleges and deemed universities in the Union territory of Puducherry .

Speaking to reporters on Monday, he said MCI had lodged a complaint with the CBI after lieutenant governor Kiran Bedi visited the Centac office and private medical colleges, deemed universities and leveled corruption charges against the government and officials involved in MBBS admission and demanded a CBI probe in 2017.

The investigation agency, which booked a case against 13 people including government officials on charges of criminal conspiracy, cheating and criminal misconduct by public servant in September 2017, sent a letter dated February 14 to the government, stating that no action is contemplated against five government officials — Narendra Kumar, K V Raman, B R Babu, V Govindaraj, K Pajaniradja alias Kichena and M Jonathan Daniel, who served as Centac chairman, health and family welfare director, secretary (health), Centac convener, Centac joint convener and Centac coordinator respectively then.

Narayanasamy said the corruption charges levelled by Bedi against the government and the officials turned out to be false after the investigation agency’s report.

“Lieutenant governor Kiran Bedi, instead of focusing on her work, has been attempting to gain cheap publicity (by levelling corruption charges). Now, the CBI has said no action is contemplated against officials. It is just the tip of an iceberg. There are several false allegations levelled by her,” Narayanasamy said adding that all her charges will be proved false sooner or later.

He said Bedi must leave Puducherry soon for the betterment of the Union territory. “What is her contribution to the territory? She has been blocking all development and welfare schemes. She has blocked schemes related to promoting tourism, industries and preventing flooding. She has been interfering in the day-to-day affairs of the administration. The lieutenant governor must act as per the aid and advice of the council of ministers. She cannot act independently, hold review meetings with the officials and intimidate officials to obey her orders. We will support the officials and protect them,” he said.

He questioned the reluctance of Bedi to appoint a regular secretary for her and her decision to appoint a retired government official as an officer on special duty despite the Union home ministry directing her to appoint the official as a consultant to the lieutenant governor. He accused her of attempting to tarnish the image of the Congress government and to disrupt the smooth functioning of the administrative machinery.

Villupuram: Tension prevailed at the Villupuram collectorate on Monday after a 59-year-old construction worker attempted suicide on the premises over a decade-long land dispute. The worker, Sarathi, said he had filed multiple complaints with police seeking action against the encroacher, but all were in vain.

A senior police officer said Sarathi lived with his wife Rakini, 58, at Sinagarathoppu in Kidangal-2 locality in Tindivanam town of the district. The couple lives in a thatched roof house measuring 2.5cents, with the remaining portion of their 5-cent plot was left vacant.

Sarathi said his neighbour Venkatapathy, 45, who started building a concrete house a decade back in a plot adjacent to his, has put up a fence encroaching around 300sqft of Sarathi's land. “The two families have been fighting over the encroached space for a decade. In 2016, to settle the dispute, Sarathi invited a revenue surveyor to measure the plots but Venakatapathy is said to have bribed and cancelled the survey,” a police officer said. The couple said they had registered multiple complaints at the Tindivanam town police station and Tindivanam DSP office but no case was registered.

Disappointed over the inaction, Sarathi and Rakini came to the Villupuram collectorate on Monday where her doused himself with kerosene. Police present there intervened. Taluk police officials pacified the couple and asked them to register a fresh complaint at the Tindivanam police station and revenue office.

MADURAI: Many private schools in the city have moved on to the digital platform for communication between teachers and parents using mobile applications (apps) like WhatsApp and separate apps designed by individual schools. While it has made the communication quicker and easier, this has also created room for bullying, invasion of privacy and creation of unnecessary tension or conflict among students and parents.

“My daughter’s school has an app, where we get homework messages, test marks, timetable, and other important updates, making it easier to access rather than diary notes earlier,” said Ramya R, a parent. Such apps by private schools also provide audio and video recordings of subject portions so the children do not miss out on the lessons. For schools that cannot afford to maintain separate apps, WhatsApp is their go-to alternative to keep up with their competition.

“It is useful but it makes the student lazy and makes the parent stressed over every small thing,” said a parent, who did not wish to be named. Even when it comes to complaints, several parents noted that school teachers, who usually think twice before calling parents to discuss their child’s behaviour, are not showing any restraint in sending messages. Hearing complaints over little things every other day makes things stressful for the child, they added.

Meanwhile, there are also few unofficial WhatsApp groups created by parents sometimes with or without teachers, which does more harm than good. “Mothers of students from a particular class and section have a WhatsApp group, where they keep discussing the progress of children or rant about the school and teachers ,” added the anonymous parent.

The president of private schools correspondents’ confederation, Senthilnathan M, noted that the technology when used judiciously really does benefit students and parents. “However, in my opinion, official communication should still happen through manual channels via circulars or secure official emails to ensure no miscommunication ,” he said.

449,['18/02/2020'],"In custody battle, children are always losers, says apex court","This story is from February 18, 2020

New Delhi: Recording the failure of Delhi high court and the Supreme Court to settle a matrimonial dispute , leading to a bitter fight for custody of their children, the apex court on Tuesday said no matter which parent won the legal battle, children always lost and could never be compensated.

The custody battle between a couple, residing in the posh Greater Kailash locality in south Delhi, started in 2013 in Delhi HC. It reached the SC in 2016. Judges hearing the case made attempts in chamber to mediate and settle the dispute, helped the children gain admission in a reputed school in Dehradun and then in Sherwood College, Nainital.

The judges even fixed the itinerary for holidays of the boy and girl with their father and mother separately but were forced to give up, saying the couple could move the trial court for guardianship rights as also the plea for divorce.

A bench of Justices A M Khanwilkar and Ajay Rastogi said, “In a custody battle, no matter which parent wins, the child always loses and it is the children who pay the heaviest price as they are shattered when the court by its judicial process tells them to go with the parent whom he or she deems fit.”

Narrating the extraordinary effort by the HC and the SC to resolve the matrimonial dispute keeping in mind that the interest of children was paramount and they were entitled to the love and affection of both parents, the SC bench said, “But if the parents are bent on separation or divorce, it is always the children who pay the heaviest price and are the sufferers.”

Writing the judgment for the bench, Justice Rastogi said, “If the parents fail to enable themselves to decide their inter se dispute, particularly in reference to custody of minor children, the court, after due scrutiny of the records of the case, reaches a conclusion that always remains a guesswork.”

On a more general note, the bench said, “All endeavours are to be made to resolve matrimonial disputes in the first instance through the process of mediation, which is one of the effective modes of alternative mechanism in resolving personal disputes (but if this not possible through mediation), further endeavour must be made by the court through its judicial process to resolve such personal disputes as expeditiously as possible.

“Delay in a decision certainly causes a great loss to the individual and deprives him/her of rights which are protected under the Constitution and with every passing day, children pay a heavy price of being deprived of the love and affection of parents for which they were never at fault but are always the loser which at no stage could be compensated monetarily or otherwise.”

AHMEDABAD: Central and state security agencies accompanied by experts from the Defence Research & Development Organisation have launched a detailed probe into a Hong Kong-flagged ship detained by the customs department at Kandla port on February 3.

The vessel “Da Cui Yun” had started its journey from Jiangyin port in China on January 17 and was destined for Port Qasim in Karachi with cargo that included some equipment used in the manufacture of missiles, according to some Indian and foreign media reports.

The ship, a general cargo vessel built in 2011, has 22 crew on board and has been moored at jetty 15 at Kandla port. Sources in Kandla Port said the vessel had called there to either load or unload some cargo but was detained after customs found something suspicious. It is also learnt that customs had an intelligence tip-off regarding suspicious goods on the vessel.

The ship was reportedly carrying autoclave, a pressure chamber weighing thousands of tonnes which is used in the launching of missiles.

Currently, 54 of 200 MBBS seats in Jipmer (150 in Puducherry and 50 seats in Karaikal) are earmarked for Puducherry students. There is a proposal to increase the number of seats from 200 to 250 from 2020.

We sent documents explaining reservation and quota pattern followed by the institute. We are not in the position to decide on the issue. We have done our job. Most probably, the ministry may follow the same pattern and publish details on reservation and quota in the prospectus,” said the official.

The Union health and family welfare ministry, in an official correspondence to Jipmer, said the ministry will hold a common and uniform National eligibility cum entrance test ( Neet ) for admission to the undergraduate medical courses in all medical institutions as per the provisions of Section (14) of the National Medical Commission Act, 2019. The institute, following the communication, announced that it will not hold entrance examinations for admission into MBBS course from 2020.

“Admission to MBBS course in Jipmer, Puducherry and Jipmer, Karaikal, will be made through National Entrance Eligibility Test (Neet UG) and the entrance exam will be conducted by the National Testing Agency and not by Jipmer from 2020 onwards,” said a notice from Jipmer.

The notice said students can get more information from websites www.nta.ac.in or ntaneet.nic.in.

Two of the accussed in police custody on Monday

RAJKOT: Four employees , including the principal , of the Shree Sahjanand Girls Institute in Bhuj were arrested on Monday for outraging the modesty of 68 girls by allegedly forcing them to strip to confirm their mensuration status last week.

Those arrested include principal Rita Raniga (38), coordinator Anita Chohan (49), hostel supervisor Ramila Hirani (29) and peon Nayna Gorasia (40). Besides outraging modesty of women and intimidation, all have also been charged under section 341(wrongful restrain) , 348 (Wrongful confinement to extort confession) and 343 (wrongful confinement) of the Indian Penal Code .

All the accused arrested by the special investigation team (SIT) formed by the Kutch police were produced in court which them sent to police custody till February 19.

Before the court police stated they wanted to find out why the accused took such extreme step and forced the girl to undress and who played the key role in the offence.

The incident had triggered outrage across the country against the ‘inhuman’ practices and humiliation the young girls had to go through.

On Sunday, a team of the National Commission for Women (NCW) met the girls at the college campus. An inquiry committee led by Dr Rajul L Desai, (member, NCW), along with advocate Malshree Gadhvi, DLSA, discussed with 44 girls (out of 68) and assured them of trying to dissuade the administration from following such inhuman practices.

The NCW team flayed the institute for heaping such rigorous practices on the young students. It however, admitted that the girls were left with little option but to follow the diktats “if they wanted to study there”.

The rules of the hostel are in violation of the girls’ right to education, which has been guaranteed to them by the constitution, Desai had said after meeting the girls.

State Congress president Girish Chodankar, Image taken from twitter

PANAJI: Fissures within the loosely stitched opposition are beginning to show. Congress on Monday accused lone MGP MLA Ramkrishna Dhavalikar of using the Mhadei water diversion issue to try and get back into the BJP-led government.

State Congress president Girish Chodankar said Dhavalikar only began an agitation in support of Goa’s interests in the Mhadei river after being unceremoniously dropped from the cabinet.

“He (Dhavalikar) was a partner of this government when the Mhadei issue was on. Why didn’t he put pressure on the government when he was deputy chief minister? Today, when he is the opposition, after Congress has been holding taluka-wise agitations on the Mhadei issue, he is blaming Congress,” Chodankar said.

A few days earlier, the former PWD Minister said Congress cannot be trusted on the Mhadei issue. He had cited comments made by Karnataka’s Congress MP BK Hariprasad .

The war of words between Congress and MGP comes just over a week after the two parties joined hands to corner BJP during the state legislative assembly session on a variety of issues.

Chodankar defended the stand taken by Hariprasad, saying that the Karnataka Congress MP was fighting for the interests of his own state. “Our Congressmen are faithful to our mother. Dhavalikar remembered to become faithful to his mother, Mhadei, only after he was out of the government,” Chodankar said.

Chodankar further said Dhavalikar would end his Mhadei agitation if the BJP offered him a post in the cabinet. “Dhavalikar is simply making allegations against Congress because he wants to get back in power. Mhadei is not an issue for him, but only a way to get back into power, which he is trying desperately,” Chodankar said.

Thiruvananthapuram: A day after 16-year-old Abhijith M R went missing from his home, his body was found on the banks of Karamana River on Monday. A Class XI student of Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, Kodunganoor, he was the son of Ratheesh Kumar and Manju G, residents of Abhiramam, Karamana–Nedumcadu Road. Ratheesh Kumar is an employee of postal department and Manju is a housewife.

There were no clothes on the body when it was found at the river bank. There were injury marks on his lips and nose. The police said that they have not found anything suspicious so far. They had registered a missing case on Sunday and changed the section to 174 CrPC for unnatural death on Monday. Police sources said that the cause of death and other details can be ascertained on after post-mortem and detailed probe.

Abhijith was preparing for his annual examination on Sunday. He had lunch together with his parents and grandmother Gomathi around 1.30pm. After lunch, his parents left for a private lab at Medical College Junction for a health check-up for Ratheesh Kumar.

A kid in the neighbourhood saw Abhijith at the door step around 3pm on Sunday. His parents also spoke to him over mobile phone, according to relatives. By 4pm, the parents returned and found out that Abhijith was not at home. He had reportedly told his grandmother that he was going out and would be back soon.

When the parents found out that Abhijith was missing, they got worried and rang up Padmakumar, the younger brother of Ratheesh Kumar who also lives at Karamana. Soon, the neighbours started searching all around for Abhijith. The search continued on Monday and went on till noon when they were told that the body of a boy had washed ashore near Sasthri Nagar-South.

The relatives went to the spot and identified the body. Karamana police completed the inquest procedures and the body was taken to the Medical College Hospital for post-mortem.

The unexpected demise of the boy threw the housing colony at Karamana into despair. Both Ratheesh Kumar and his wife Manju sat devastated in the drawing room “I had not ever scolded him, why did he leave us?,” Manju spoke between her sobs even as people around tried to comfort her. Every time a relative came, she grasped their arms and said, “You promised me you would bring him alive, right”.

The neighbours and relatives remembered Abhijith as a boy who usually kept to himself. “Being a single child, he was very much attached to his parents. He rarely went out except with his parents,” said Balu, a neighbour. During office get together, Abhijith remained mostly with his parents, recollected colleagues of Ratheesh Kumar.

The relatives found it hard to believe that Abhijith was no more. He is not known to have shared any issues at tuition centre or school nor with his parents or close relatives. They said that on Sunday he had told his father to drop him off at school for the examination.

“He was a quiet child, he didn’t have many friends. He never seemed to have been too much concerned about his studies because he always did well in his exams,” said Padmakumar, brother of Ratheeshkumar.

Nagpur: The presence of tigers in a sanctuary is not the only criteria for a protected area (PA) to be adjudged the best. In the management effective evaluation (MEE), the Tipeshwar wildlife sanctuary, which has 12-15 tigers, has ranked sixth among the 11 PAs that were evaluated in Maharashtra.

According to the MEE report on national parks and wildlife sanctuaries (2018-19) released recently, the 148sqkm Tipeshwar scored 70.80% and Painganga sanctuary 62.06%. Both PAs in Yavatmal district were rated as ‘good’. The report has also recommended Tipeshwar to be notified as a tiger reserve.

The exercise is conducted by MoEFCC every year. For tiger reserves, MEE is conducted every four years. Rating up to 40% is considered as poor; 41-59% is rated as fair; 60-74% is considered as good and those above 75% fall in very good category.

Apart from Tipeshwar and Painganga, the other 9 PAs that were evaluated by MEE team included Mayureshwar Supe, Nandur Madhameshwar, Sagareshwar, Sanjay Gandhi, Thane Creek, Tungareshwar, Yawal, Yedsi Ramling Ghat and Naigaon Mayur.

Thane Creek Flamingo Wildlife Sanctuary topped the chart with a score of 75.92% and was rated as ‘very good’ followed by the Sanjay Gandhi National Park (SGNP) 75.80% and Mayureshwar Supe with a score of 75%, both also in the ‘very good’ category.

According to MEE chairperson UM Sahai, former chief wildlife warden of Rajasthan, the MEE of sanctuaries is done every year.

“In 2017-18, six sanctuaries were evaluated in Maharashtra. It is done as per listings by the Wildlife Institute of India (WII), Dehradun. These PAs were first evaluated in 2005-06 and now were subjected to evaluation for the second time,” Sahai said.

It is not only the presence of tigers or leopards which makes a national park and sanctuary best. Of the 11 PAs, Tipeshwar, which is being proposed to be a tiger reserve, was ranked sixth.

Seema Bhatt, an independent scientist, who was one of the members of the MEE team, said, “The presence of big carnivores is not the sole criteria to judge any PA. We have a very detailed questionnaire. We consider factors like habitat development, human interference, flora and fauna, biotic pressure among a host of other issues.”

Bhatt said, “The exercise is done with the involvement of the staff. While valuating the PAs, we also mention their strengths and weaknesses.”

The report though mentions several strengths of Tipeshwar like adequate staff, protection huts, tourism potential, notified eco-sensitive zone, vehicles, presence of tigers, no villages inside, eco-development committees (EDCs) among a host of other facilities. The major weaknesses include 26 villages around the sanctuary, poaching by wire snares, illicit felling and grazing and forest fires.

The expert committee has suggested to declare Tipeshwar a tiger reserve, prepare a zone plan, develop better tourist facilities, display signage, create one more range and take up capacity building of staff and guides.

Thiruvananthapuram: After several years of dilly-dallying, stage is getting cleared for Vattiyoorkavu Junction development.

Public works department (PWD) minister G Sudhakaran will lay the foundation stone for the junction widening project on March 4. He will also launch works to lay boundary stones. Ahead of this, a joint survey by PWD and revenue department will begin on Wednesday.

The junction widening scheme, a long-pending demand of the area, got the much needed push when Kerala infrastructure investment fund board (KIIFB) approved Rs 100 crore after the detailed project report was submitted by the PWD for widening of the junction and four roads leading to it.

MLA V K Prasanth said that the land acquisition for widening of the junction will begin soon. He said that Trivandrum Development Authority (TRIDA) is in charge of the project for rehabilitation of traders.

“A joint survey of PWD and revenue department to mark the alignment will be held on Wednesday,” said an official of the PWD. PWD has estimated that around 10.9 hectares will be acquired for widening of the junction and nearby roads.

“Four roads – Vattiyoorkavu-Peroorkada Road, Vattiyoorkavu-Sasthamangalam Road, Vattiyoorkavu-Thoppumukku Road and Vazhayila-Mannarakonam Road will be widened to 18.5m. KIIFB has approved the DPR of the project and has approved allotment of Rs 100 crore for it. This will pave way for widening of the junction,” said the PWD official.

Meanwhile, the project for rehabilitation of traders to be undertaken by TRIDA too got approval in the recent board meeting of KIIFB.

For the project worth Rs 45 crore submitted by TRIDA, KIIFB has given approval for initial fund of Rs 27 crore. According to TRIDA officials, the shopping complex could accommodate over 300 traders who will be shifted for the junction improvement works. As per TRIDA’s proposal, a bus terminal, shopping complex, multi-level parking plaza, auto-taxi stand, comfort station etc. will be included in the triangular plot in Vattiyoorkavu Junction.

With the bus terminal planned in the plot, the traffic congestion caused due to the presence of a bus stop along the busy road will be resolved. TRIDA is acquiring around three acres in the area.

A social impact assessment (SIA) study will be conducted for land acquisition after the initial survey. PWD officials said that tender for the project could be invited after acquiring 90% of land.

PANAJI: Welcoming the Supreme Court’s observations over criminals contesting elections, Congress on Monday said they will “maintain high moral ground” and not select candidates with criminal records for the coming Zilla Panchayat (ZP) .

The party also accused the state election commission of colluding with BJP to give the saffron party an advantage in the rural body elections.

“ZP election candidates will be scrutinised and we will see that the high moral ground for ZP polls are maintained,” Chodankar said.

He went on to allege that BJP was dictating terms to the state election commission in order to put opposition parties at a disadvantage.

“It is BJP organising secretary and the president who are deciding which constituency is to be reserved. They are trying to destroy opposition candidates,” he said.

467,['18/02/2020'],Jakhar: Looking into Pargat’s concerns,"This story is from February 18, 2020

Chandigarh: Reacting to the letter by Congress MLA Pargat Singh pointing out that the state government had faltered in keeping its promises, party’s Punjab president Sunil Jakhar on Monday claimed that the issues flagged by the former Indian hockey captain were already being look into.

Incidentally, Jakhar and Pargat were together at a programme of the Punjab Youth Congress (PYC) in Chandigarh, a day after the MLA’s letter to the party leadership surfaced in the public domain on Sunday.

Talking to mediapersons, Pargat confirmed having raised the issues with chief minister Amarinder Singh and said he stood by the content of his letter. Since Pargat is known to be close to former cabinet minister Navjot Singh Sidhu, his letter set the political circles abuzz with speculations.

Asked if he tried to reach out to the Jalandhar Cantonment MLA, Jakhar said the chief minister had given directions to the deputy commissioners last week pertaining to some of the issues raised by Pargat. “I believe the letter was written sometime back. He has pointed out certain expectations of the people and corrective steps are being taken. The CM has already asked the DCs to prioritise people’s issues,” he added.

In his letter, Pargat said the Congress was given a big mandate by Punjabis in 2017 with Amarinder’s performance and working style during his first tenure in mind, but an impression was now gaining ground that they were getting disappointed with the performance of the state government. He listed drug menace and empty coffers among the main reasons.

There has been talk of increasing discontent among a section of the Congress MLAs and before Pargat some others too had questioned the free hand given to the civil and police administration in the state, besides delay in taking convincing action on the issue of religious sacrilege.

468,['18/02/2020'],CM Amarinder Singh says Punjab will renegotiate power pacts with private players,"This story is from February 18, 2020

Punjab CM Amarinder Singh

CHANDIGARH: Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh on Monday said his government would renegotiate the power purchase agreements (PPAs) which the erstwhile SAD-BJP government had signed to “defraud the state and its people.”

He added that given the shortfall in production by the state-owned power plants at Lehra Mohabbat and Ropar, the government would work around the existing arrangements with private players to make power rates more affordable while ensuring that the peak demand of 13,000MW is effectively met. He also warned the private players against messing with Punjab’s finances.

The CM was addressing the newly elected Punjab Youth Congress (PYC) office-bearers over tea on Monday when he made the announcement. He claimed that the state was reconsolidating its financial position due to his government’s efforts over the last three years and any attempt to scuttle the momentum would not be tolerated. A section of Congress leaders, including Rajya Sabha MP Partap Singh Bajwa and state president Sunil Jakhar, have been demanding that the controversial PPAs be renegotiated so that the consumers do not have to face back-to-back hikes in tariff.

The PPAs had lately turned into a political issue with AAP also targeting the Congress government for continuing with the arrangement made by the previous SAD-BJP government. It had demanded that the state government scrap the PPAs. Reacting to this, the chief minister had announced last month that a white paper on the power scenario will be presented in the monsoon session of Punjab assembly to “expose the fraud” committed by the Akalis with regard to the controversial PPAs with private players.

Last week, AAP MLA Aman Arora wrote to Congress national president Sonia Gandhi, pointing out that the state Congress unit, in its 2017 assembly election manifesto, had promised to scrap or review the “anti-Punjab” agreements with three private power plants but nothing had been done in this regard even when the government was about to complete three years in power.

Even the Akalis had sought an independent probe into the matter, alleging that the state extended “undue benefits” of Rs 2,500 crore to private power plants. SAD had accused the government of “deliberate laxity” in pursuing disputes involving Rs 2,500 crore on account of coal washing charges.

Through the coal washing process, impurities like ash, soil, rock are removed from coal. Due to these charges, power rates in Punjab were increased by 36 paise a unit from January 1 for domestic consumers.

Villupuram: Pattali Makkal Katchi founder-leader S Ramadoss on Monday urged the Tamil Nadu government to take over the agriculture college in Annamalai University and declare it as a government agriculture college, similar to its take over of the administrative control of Rajah Muthiah Medical College in Annamalai University.

Ramadoss in a statement said students have demanded that the government take over Annamalai University’s agriculture college and affiliate it to Tamil Nadu agricultural university (TNAU), following its successful taking over of the university’s medical college.

“There are more reasons for taking over the university’s agriculture college than the medical college. The decrease in annual fees of the medical college by Rs 5 lakh after the government took over the administrative control is the primary reason for the change in administrative control. But for the agriculture college, there are several genuine factors necessitating the change in the administrative control other than the decrease in annual fees,” Ramadoss said.

He said though the college has basic infrastructural facilities, there are doubts over its quality of education. He cited that the TNAU in its 2019-20 prospectus openly declared that students with an undergraduate degree from the agriculture college in Annamalai University are not eligible to apply for postgraduate courses offered by it.

He said the college, which is spread in 860 acres, includes several farms. The college has qualified and talented teaching faculty members and researchers and there are ample opportunities to transform the college into the best agriculture college and research institute, the PMk founder said.

Goa to be ready for future

PANAJI: The state government has set a deadline of October 2020 to install 38 early cyclone warning dissemination towers across the coastal belt of the state. The World Bank will provide Rs 108 crore to the state government under the National Cyclone Risk Mitigation project.

The early warning dissemination system has three components that include installation of towers, shelter home during cyclone and underground electricity cabling, revenue secretary Sanjay Kumar told TOI. The World Bank funds for the project will not come as a loan, he said.

Kumar said that under the project, 39 towers — 19 in North Goa and 20 in South — would be installed across the coastline. The towers will be 5m, 10m and 15m in height and once they receive an alert, they will automatically raise an alarm, he said.

The project is being executed by the water resources department and the total cost of installation will be around Rs 18 crore. “We have set a deadline to install the tower by October 2020,” the secretary said. The state government has awarded the contract to erect the towers to BIPS System Ltd.

Around Rs 33 crore would be spent on laying underground power cables in the coastal belt so that if a cyclone hits the state, then electricity supply is not disrupted.

Twelve cyclone shelters — five in the North and seven in South — will be established in the state under the same project at a cost of Rs 38 crore. The state government has issued tenders for four shelters, construction has started on six shelters and in two cases — Zuarinagar and Altinho — the location will be changed.

Shelters will come up at Dabolim, Mahalwada, Nagarcem, Aquem and Porvorim. Kumar said that for the maintenance of cyclone shelters, as per rules, a society will be formed by involving locals. The society has to conduct social activities at the cyclone shelter and the revenue generated will be used for the maintenance of the shelters.

Nagpur: Two women, including a Std XI student, committed suicide at different locations in the city. In both the cases police have recovered suicide notes and have registered accidental death.

In the first incident, Trisha Patil, 16, hanged herself at her home in Wadi . In the suicide note, the girl said sorry to her family for taking the drastic step.

Sources in Wadi police station claimed that a ‘shayari’ written in the suicide note suggests that Trisha might have taken the drastic step after getting into a fight with a male friend.

Trisha had gone to tuition on Sunday at around 1.30pm. After returning home at 5.30pm, Trishna went to her room where she hanged herself. Her mother and grandfather were at home but they thought she was studying in her room. The incident came to light after Trisha’s father Sumant came home and inquired about her in the night.

When Trisha did not respond to their calls, her family members broke the door and saw her hanging to the ceiling fan. She was taken to a private hospital where she was declared brought dead. As soon as the news broke on Monday, her schools friends started approaching her house.

The post mortem was conducted on Monday at Mayo hospital after which the body was handed over to her relatives for performing last rites.

In another incident, Surbhi Kudve, 24, hanged just months before her marriage. Surbhi was found hanging to the ceiling fan at her home in Vakil Peth. Cops said Surbhi was alone at her home when she took the drastic step.

Imambada police have also recovered a suicide note in which Surbhi claimed that she blames no one and asked for forgiveness from her parents.

Police are yet to find any concrete reason behind both the suicides.

WATER WOES

PONDA: Locals of Dhatwada and Usgao on Monday relented to allow the water resources department (WRD) to lay a pipeline on the Dhaushirem-Khandepar nullah, but under certain conditions.

The Dhatwada-Usgao Citizen Forum submitted a letter to the superintending engineer of WRD, Pramod Badami, on Monday setting conditions for the pipeline, which includes laying it a meter above and along the border of the nullah, and demolishing a bandhara constructed on the nullah by a private factory. The locals have also demanded that the WRD should release water to horticulture farms on the banks of the nullah and that all assurances be given in writing.

So far, the locals have been opposed to laying of an underground pipeline in the nullah, demanding that the WRD either change the route of the pipeline or lay it at a raised level.

The WRD has been laying a 1,000mm pipeline to facilitate augmentation of the Khandepar river during summer using water from the Ganjem water scheme on the Mhadei. The Opa water works complex, which comprises five water treatment plants that collectively supply potable water to over 90% of Ponda and Tiswadi talukas, is fully dependent on the Khandepar river.

Until last summer, water from Ganjem would be poured directly into the Dhaushirem nullah, from where it would flow into the Khandepar river.

As the entire quantity of water does not reach the river due to losses by evaporation, ground seepage and drawing by farmers midway, the WRD has been laying the pipeline.

Sabu KA (face covered) at CBI court in Kochi on Monday

KOCHI: The special crime branch unit of Central Bureau of Investigation ( CBI ) has arrested a sub-inspector in connection with Nedumkandam custodial torture death case in which private financier Rajakumar (53) died in police custody in June 2019.

Sub-inspector Sabu K A (46), a native of Perumpilly near Njarackal in Ernakulam, is under suspension. He was arrested by the officials after being summoned for interrogation in the case on Sunday night.

“Sabu was summoned to Kochi CBI office for interrogation on Sunday. Later, based on his statements, his arrest was recorded at 9.30pm on Sunday night. We produced him before Ernakulam chief judicial magistrate court and the court granted a six-day custody of him for further interrogation. He will be produced in the court again at 4pm on Saturday. He will be taken to Nedumkandam to recover the materials used to torture the deceased,” said an officer.

Sabu served as sub-inspector of Nedumkandam police station when the incident pertaining to the case happened. Following a case registered under Kerala Money Lenders Act, Rajlkumar, a native of Wagamon, was taken into custody on June 12 by a team led by Sabu, who was claimed to be in charge of the station in the absence of station house officer. After remanded to Peerumedu sub jail, he died at a hospital on June 21.

Though Sabu was earlier arrested by the crime branch in the case, the high court granted him bail. CBI took over the case in December from the crime branch. CBI arrested Sabu after the Supreme Court cancelled the bail granted by the HC when the state government challenged it. Six other police officials of Nedumgandam police station are accused in the case.

Rajkumar was kept in illegal custody till June 15 before his arrest was recorded by the police and during this time, he reportedly underwent severe police torture. Though the initial postmortem report stated pneumonia as the cause of death, a re-postmortem carried out on August 22 found 22 injuries on the body. A judicial inquiry is also underway by a commission led by Justice K Narayana Kurup.

After Class X, children are guided on what steps to take next.

Every time her taxi enters her colony in Dharavi, Naghma Sayyed slips on her burkha and enters her alternate muted avatar. Otherwise, the fiesty 23-year-old is busy learning how to apply false eyelashes or creating Instagram videos on how to do your make-up that are gathering more likes than she ever imagined. Recently, she gave an impassioned speech at a national UNDP-sponsored conference on youth and skilling. “My family doesn’t like all this, but I am certain I want to be financially independent before I get married,” says the school dropout. “Slowly, slowly, they have begun to understand that I really mean it.”

Sayyed is one of urban India’s millions of young adults who are trying to navigate the mismatch between aspiration and opportunity. Theirs is a world where being 10th pass rarely translates into employment; where career counselling is non-existent; and where parents are indifferent, clueless or even adversarial—especially when it comes to girls. “Working girls are not considered good marriage material,” says Priya Agrawal, founder of Antarang Foundation, a non-profit organisation that trains youth in employability skills and empowers them to find suitable careers. Girls like Sayyed have had to constantly negotiate with a family for whom education is dangerous because it gives a girl “wings on her feet”. But Antarang has given her the wings.

Recognising the long-unadressed gap between education and employability, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation ( BMC ) has tied up with Antarang to offer career counselling in 223 of its schools . The counsellors engage with not just students, but also their parents, helping them break gender stereotypes, understand their child’s potential better, or feel more comfortable with unusual career choices. “For example, a Dadar girl’s parents realised their daughter had options even in the field of sports and became open to the idea of her wearing shorts and playing basketball,” says a facilitator.

The ‘Career Aware’ program, started a couple of years ago, comprises an intensive series of sessions that take place in classes IX and X. It includes psychometric tests —conducted in Hindi, Marathi, Urdu and English— which help children become more self-aware about their abilities, desires and potential. Group sessions are followed by one-on-ones, followed by sessions with parents, many of whom are themselves in dead-end or low-paying jobs and have no idea how to break the cycle. “After the children are exposed to various options out there, we find they really speak their minds and identify what they want to do,” says Mamta Rao, BMC deputy education officer. “So indirectly it also helps them build self-confidence.”

After Class X, children are guided on what steps to take next. They are also exposed to real professionals in fields of their choice, to get a sense of what a waiter, a beautician or a physiotherapist’s day looks like. They are nudged to think about family issues and confront questions like: If I know I have to start earning and contributing to the family income within the next two years, can I realistically become an architect, which requires many more years of education? What are my job options? How much can my family support this decision? What is the average pay in this sector?

“Half the problem is awareness, exposure and access,” says Agrawal. For example, few are aware of an all-girls Industrial Training Insitute (ITI) in Dadar. Or, that there are 16 ITIs in Mumbai, run via public-private partnerships. Or, that the Tatas run a free hospitality service training centre called Tata Strive which offers training in everything from how to serve water to how to fold a bed.

Once students complete school, Antarang conducts the ‘Career Ready’ program at colleges and in various communities. More than 6,000 youth have gone through the program and some 2,000 are working in full-time and part-time jobs with an average starting pay of Rs 10-12,000

“We are now involved in setting up a national framework on career counselling, which would ensure that every school will have a career facilitator, have exposure visits,” says Agrawal.

She suggests just as there are anganwadis in every neighbourhood, there should be localised career counselling centres for young adults which can become employability hubs in every ward. Two such have already come into being—in Dharavi and Powai. “The idea is to facilitate the school-to-work transition to break the inter-generational poverty cycle.”

Video grab of police action against the protesters

Rajkot: One may have heard of traders’ agitations breaking out over the issues of fixing the falling prices of their produce and other such demands, but to take to the street over the issue of mosquito menace is quite unheard of.

Such was a scene on Rajkot-Morbi Highway, where an unresolved problem of mosquitoes drove traders of Rajkot new market yard to resort to stone pelting when cops tried to stop their stir on Monday. About 30 protesters were detained for rioting and preventing the police from performing their duty.

On Monday afternoon, about 50 traders staged a chakka jam (road block) on Rajkot-Morbi Highway and burnt tyres. “When we tried to disperse the protesters, they pelted stones at us, in which five cops received injuries,” said M C Vala, inspector with Kuwadawa Road police station.

“We have been suffering from the mosquito menace for the past five years. Hydrilla and water hyacinth in the still water of a stream that eventually flows into Aji River has become a breeding ground for mosquitoes. The dirty water from gutters in Rajkot is released into this stream on daily basis, spawning mosquitoes,” said Atul Kamani, president of commission agents’ association associated with the new market yard.

Kamani said that after several representations before Rajkot Municipal Corporation (RMC) failed, they were left with no option, but to take action. “We had called for a one-day strike at the market yard on Monday as a mark of protest. As part of the protest we blocked Rajkot-Morbi Highway, which invited the police’s action,” he said.

“We had written to the RMC to take a cue from Surat Municipal Corporation and make use of weeder machines to weed out hydrilla and water hyacinth. But our request fell on the deaf ears of the RMC officials,” said one of the agitating traders.

Those cops injured in the stone pelting were identified as crime branch sub-inspector P M Dhakhda, crime branch head constable Mayur Patel and crime branch constables — Jayantibhai and Jagmalbhai.

Thiruvananthapuram: Local self-government minister A C Moideen unveiled the ‘ Trivandrum Declaration ’ formulated by representatives of various cities who took part in the Zero-Waste Conference which concluded here on Monday.

The declaration aims at establishing a collective of cities working towards attaining ‘zero-waste status’ in their areas by implementing a set of measures like reduction of single-use materials, green protocol, engaging youth and encouraging agriculture and water conservation activities.

As many as 260 representatives from 23 cities took part in the zero-waste conference, which was organised by the city corporation.

As per the declaration, it was decided that representatives of the cities would meet every two years and review the activities each city has initiated and the progress it has achieved. The declaration lays focus on extended producer responsibility, reduction in generation of waste and recycling.

Moideen said that for all such initiatives to be successful, public have to be prepared for reducing waste and for undertaking source-level waste management .

“Awareness is the key. How we can line up people for noble causes regarding waste management is the major challenge. Kerala can create models in this sector like we had done in other areas,” said the minister.

The minister said that after the closure of Vilappilsala waste treatment plant, city corporation tried out different methods involving people and the success indicates that it can be emulated everywhere. He said that finding land is a huge challenge with regard to various projects.

AMRITSAR: Nearly 16 years after a “suicide pact” wip- ed out a five-member Amritsar family, a city court on Monday convicted a former DIG of Punjab Police , a serving deputy SP, Hardev Singh , and four relatives of the deceased of extortion and abetment, among other charges.

Retired DIG Kultar Sin- gh was the SSP of Amritsar in 2004 when Hardip Singh , a resident of the Chowk Karori neighbourhood, and four members of his family — mother, wife Romi and minor sons — were found dead in their home.

A suicide note purportedly written by Hardip and messages scribbled on the walls of a room accused Kultar Singh of driving him and his family to take the extreme step on the night of October 30, 2004.

According to the case diary, Hardip had allegedly murdered his father and was spotted by a relative while trying to dispose of the body. She told her father-in-law about it and he started blackmailing Hardip, extorting Rs 7.25 lakh.

When some officers at the local thana got wind of this, they too extorted Rs 5 lakh from Hardip and demanded another Rs 7 lakh, the prosecution established. DSP Hardev Singh was then the officer-in-charge of Kotwali police station.

Nagpur: In a fast track action in case involving crime against women, a college from East Nagpur has terminated services of a professor accused of molesting a first-year student in just 45 days after completing probe. The professor was about to retire on March 31.

The accused has also been ordered to shell out Rs25,000 compensation for the trauma inflicted on the student belonging to reserved category.

TOI is withholding the name of the professor as the student has refused to file an FIR though the college has submitted a complaint application with the local police.

The sexual assault took place on December 26, 2019, when the professor had allegedly taken the girl out in his car on the pretext of attending a conference and made undue advances towards her. Next day, the 18-year-old girl broke down before a woman professor who informed the principal.

Acting swiftly, college management set up an eight-member inquiry panel as per Vishakha Guidelines on December 27 and started the proceedings from December 28 onwards. Nagpur University (NU) and college authorities decided to process the complaint through the Internal Complaints Committee (ICC), which deals with sexual harassment of women at workplaces, to ensure the accused is punished.

Following NU’s Ordinance 53 would have allowed the accused professor to retire with all benefits even before the first hearing had taken place. After several rounds of hearing till January 16, the ICC indicted the professor and recommended his removal from service.

In his defence, the tainted professor had sought 15 days time in the last week of January to explain his side after the management served him one last show cause notice. The college gave him only a week to respond before confirming his termination on February 14.

As per inquiry report, the professor had given contradictory statements in response to the allegations. While he claimed before the panel that he didn’t know the student, he had admitted to have picked her up in his car on December 26 from outside the college. The professor had also admitted to having apologized to the girl by falling on her feet the next day when principal and other teachers questioned him.

According to college officials, the girl is reluctant to file a police complaint against the professor fearing that her parents will stop her education after that. The survivor belongs to a poor family and the professor had promised to give her Rs550 for enrolling in a computer course, said college officials.

The panel, led by vice-principal and comprising two outside members, also secured the testimony of another girl who confirmed the pervert behaviour of the professor.

A college official said that the professor had harassed several other girls also, but none came forward to complain. In this case, the college had also sent him on compulsory leave to prevent him from influencing the victim.

The professor was one of the suspects in the murder of principal Moreshwar Wankhede in November 2017. Wankhede’s wife and daughter were also charged with the murder. The mother-daughter duo had allegedly taken help of the professor, who was underground for several days after the murder. Role of senior cops had come under scanner after they failed to question the professor in the case.

CHANDIGARH: The Supreme Court judgment making women army officers eligible for permanent commission and in commanding roles has been received well by the defence fraternity, who have described it as a fair verdict.

According to experts, the issue was more of an administrative or technical issue had the government not have taken an “hypothetical” and “fallacious” stand that women may not be accepted as commanders by male troops.

Even in its 54-page verdict, criticizing the central government’s argument and emphasizing on women officers’ right to equality, the Supreme Court observed that 70 years after the birth of a post-colonial independent state, there still was need for change in attitude s and mindsets to recognize commitment to the values of the Constitution.

Gen V P Malik, the former Indian Army chief, said the Supreme Court judgment is “welcoming and implementable.”

Lt Gen D S Hooda, former Army commander, Northern Command , said the apex court’s decision is a move towards gender mainstreaming in the Indian Army. “Now, the next task for the Army would be decide the modalities regarding their selection for command positions and I believe that the Army should do a fair tresatment with them,” Hooda added. Major Navdeep Singh, a former military reservist, and an expert in military law, said, “Nari Shakti now actually gets translated into reality, beyond parade ground.”

Ranjana Malik, former Army captain and wife of General V P Malik, said she had served in Army Medical Corps where the women officers have reached to the rank of Lt General and headed the command hospitals. “It is a great decision and the government’s argument that soldiers will not accept orders from woman officers was fallacious and undignified for men and women of the armed forces,” she added.

Flt Lt Promila Dhaka , who has served Indian Air Force (IAF) as short service commission officer, said it is a great moment, especially for short service commissioned women officers who gave their prime years to the forces and were not allowed to continue the job at a time when it was difficult for them to re-start a new career at that phase of life.

Terming the verdict as “heartening,” Major Priya Jhingan, the first lady cadet to join the Indian Army in 1992, said women officers had already proved their capabilities when they were inducted first time in the Army even in new roles, after this decision, they would prove best for this great institution (Army). “It is a day which will go down in the history of the Indian Army as a golden day. I appreciate the progressive and positive attitude of the Supreme Court. Now perhaps my granddaughter will be able to join the infantry too. Go ahead women! Show them what you are made of. All the best,” she added.
