1,['28/02/2020'],"More women are studying science, but how many are pursuing it as a career?","This story is from February 28, 2020

Pop culture has its fair share of depictions of women scientists pioneering breakthrough findings either in the forefront or in the shadows of more illustrious male colleagues. And given that cinema and TV is often a reflection of society, one would be inclined to believe that there are quite a few women toiling away in laboratories across the world.

The truth, though, say those in the know is a far cry from this. According to women scientists and college professors, there are only a handful of women pursuing sciences. In fact, there is a huge disparity in the number of women and men in science, with the latter far outnumbering the former. This, they add, is strange, because quite a few women take up science and science-related courses for graduate and even post-graduate studies, but the numbers taper by the time they reach the post-doctorate level. BT explores why...

‘Women make compromises for family; only the strongest can survive in a science stream’

Shobhana Narasimhan, professor, Theoretical Sciences Unit at Jawaharlal Nehru Centre For Advanced Scientific Research (JNCASR), who is a member of the Standing Committee on Women in Science of the Government of India and has presented several papers on women in science, says that multiple factors contribute to fewer women in science. “Often, when I attend conferences, either I’m the only woman speaker or there would be no women speakers at all. Women scientists have raised objection and even boycotted many conferences because of the lack of representation,” says Shobhana.

Why, though? “It is the women who have to make compromises to accommodate family responsibilities. Looking after the kids, managing the household and being a working mom can be hard. And when choices have to be made, family comes first. Also, those pursuing science often end up marrying within the community. The trouble with that is that scientific institutions have unwritten rules to not hire couples. As a result, one of the partner has to either find other employment for which he/she is overqualified, or move cities to find the right job, which in turn affects family life. Most importantly, though, the general perception is that it is best to not hire a woman to a position of importance because she will not be able to manage,” she adds.

Science is not a stop-gap arrangement before taking up professional courses

One of the most common reasons for students to drop out of science graduate studies earlier, explains Vimala CM, Dean of Sciences undergraduate studies at Mount Carmel College, was that they looked at the course as a stop gap measure while continuing to attempt entrance exams for professional courses in engineering and medicine. “Pure science study was not at the top of the list for many students. If they didn’t get through to a professional college straight after Class XII, they’d join an undergraduate science stream, but drop out in the middle of the academic year once they got into the course of their choice,” she says, adding, “Today, things have changed. We’ve students leaving engineering and medical courses midway to pursue degrees in sciences. Courses like chemistry, botany, zoology, environmental science, microbiology and biotechnology have more takers.”

Girls now understand the importance of pure science study

Lekha George, professor, Department of Botany at Mount Carmel College, says, “Earlier, we had fewer students taking up pure sciences, today the classes are at full strength. Students are turning down engineering and medical seats, because they understand the importance of pure sciences.” Vimala adds, “There are a few girls in the field of research now. Their numbers are far less compared to their male counterparts, but there’s a steady rise. For example, a student of mine, Radha Krishnakumar, was a part of the team at the J Craig Venter Institute in Rockville, Maryland, which created the world’s first synthetic bacterial cell.”

‘Need to help women in science minimise career breaks’

Rohini Godbole, Honorary Professor, Centre for Higher Energy Physics, at the Indian Institute of Science (IISc) says the need of the hour is for institutions to frame rules and guidelines that make it easier for women to follow a career in science. “There are existing programmes under the Department of Science and Technology and Department of Biotechnology that urge women to return to their fold even after the break. These programmes have been there for almost 15 years. But, I feel that such programmes address issues superficially, because science does not wait for anyone. By the time people return after a break, newer methods, technology and processes come into the picture, so, for an individual it’s like being at the starting line again,” she says.

To minimise the breaks, Rohini advocates setting up creche facilities for the children of post-doctoral fellows/students (both men and women) as well, and not just for faculty, because students cannot afford to pay for childcare.

‘I Want to be like Jane Goodall’

I wanted to pursue a bachelors degree in chemistry, botany and zoology (CBZ), because I have always been attracted to wildlife sciences. In fact, I have been a fan of Cristina Mittermeier, who is a conservation photographer, Jane Goodall, primatologist and conservationist, and Asha de Vos, marine biologist from Sri Lanka. I follow their work online and I see myself doing what they do.

— Ranjana Gauri M, a final year student at Mount Carmel College

‘Parents support my career choice’

Though my father is an engineer and my mother is a doctor, they supported her decision to pursue microbiology. They know the importance of science and how our foundation needs to be solid. In fact, my mother, who is now venturing into research, says that for any cure or any medicine, the foundation of pure science is needed and that is why they supported my decision to study microbiology.

My appa (K Bhagyaraj) was making Vaettiya Madichu Kattu then and he was discussing the script with my mother (Poornima Bhagyaraj) at our home. He was telling her about how he was searching for a boy in a particular age group to play an important role in the film. I was in Class Four then and had just come home from school. I walked into their room and was just hopping around, holding my school bag. Appa saw me then, and he was like, ‘Sonu, un age la oru character irukku. Pannariya?’.I said ‘okay’ and just walked out. He was surprised when I agreed immediately, but was also worried that I might feel let down or conscious if I didn’t get to act in the film. My mom told him that they could shoot with me after school and on weekends. But my dad wanted to first do a screen test to see how comfortable I was in front of the camera. So, on that big day, he gave me a dialogue sheet and told me that I should walk inside the room, mouth the dialogues and simultaneously do some actions.So I confidently walked inside the room, took off my school bag, played around with the phone, all the while delivering my lines. And then suddenly, I stopped and told them that I had to urgently use the restroom, much to their amusement. They all burst out laughing, but I guess my dad was convinced by then that I was at ease in front of the camera. He was like, ‘Dialogues-um, action-um simultaneous-a pannaradhu chinna pasangalukku kashtam. Ivan manage panniduvan’. That screen test was the first-ever time I faced the camera and was quite a memorable experience. When Sakkarakatti happened years later, I was already prepared to face the camera.So, there was no nervousness. The first scene they shot for the film was the one in which Deepali (played by Ishita Sharma) and I break up, but the makers wanted to do a happy shot before that.

10,['28/02/2020'],Israeli orchestra to enthrall with a mix of classical and electronic music,"Bringing together tunes of western classical and electronic music this weekend is Castle in Time — an Israeli youth orchestra, which is set to perform in Bengaluru for the first time. The orchestra will perform along with 15 members of The Bangalore School of Music Chamber Orchestra. The 24-member orchestra, boasting instruments like woodwinds, brass, electric guitar, bass guitar, drum set, percussion, synthesizers, harp and other instruments, is known for its original compositions and performances that combine music, movement and video. “Unlike other orchestras, we write and perform original music. We write the music specifically for our musicians and the setup we have, which helps each artiste to contribute on an individual level,” says Shalev Ne’eman, percussionist.Tal Donner Rozenrot, CEO for the orchestra, says, “Another factor that sets us apart is the fact that we combine western classical and electronic music. There aren’t that many orchestras that combine these two genres of music. In addition to this, the conductor, Matan Daskal, is a professional dancer and he introduces movement into the performance. We also have visual elements in our performances sometimes.”One of the most interesting parts of the performance is when the band follows Matan’s movements and signs for the music and do not have any music sheets to follow. “During that particular segment, the musicians do not follow any musical notation charts. Instead, they follow Matan, who communicates with them through signs — this form of communication is called sound painting and is used in many countries. It’s more of an interaction and a visual treat for audiences and the musicians as well. It’s a perception of space and the people around the conductor,” explains Shalev.Speaking about the performance of the two orchestras, Jagadeesh MR, Director of operations at the Bangalore School of Music (BSM), says, “We have always looked forward to performing with different artistes and orchestras, especially from Israel. It’s great exposure to western classical music for our students, because in Bengaluru it is still considered niche. A collaboration like this also helps in exchange of views, music and culture and this is exactly what we need today. The performance will be very different from what we usually do, because of the concept of sound painting as it brings out the creativity in the musicians, who are on stage.”",entertainment,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74333953,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-204034/74333953.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/kannada/music/israeli-orchestra-to-enthrall-with-a-mix-of-classical-and-electronic-music/articleshow/74333953.cms
11,['28/02/2020'],Seaweed is a lot more than just exotic food,"Whether or not you have tried scuba diving, that the ocean bed is a treasure trove of a variety of unique flora is no secret. One of the marine species, the seaweeds are no longer a source of food for ocean life alone, as many people in East and Southeast Asia are indulging in this slimy green vegetable as a dietary option. You’ll find seaweeds in their soups, rolls, sushi and other traditional cuisine. Thanks to their health benefits, these underwater plants are now gaining the reputation of ‘wonder food’ in India as well. “Seaweeds are invaluable marine herbs. These are considered a prolific source of bioactive compounds that have extraordinary medicinal properties,” says Dr Kajal Chakraborty, Senior Scientist at Central Marine Fisheries Research Institute (CMFRI), which recently released a research paper on the benefits of seaweeds. Studies also claim that farming seaweed could help counter the threats of global warming. Here’s why switching to seaweed is a good idea…This newbie superfood, which is now added to several health drinks, is said to be a great source of fibre that promotes gut health. “The sulphated polysaccharides found in seaweed have been proven to increase the growth of good gut bacteria. “One such seaweed, called Nori, which is used in Japanese cuisine, is now available in India,” says Nicky Dabas, National President at Nutrition and Natural Health Sciences Association. Dr Kajal adds,“Marine macroalgae is an antioxidant, while it also anti-obesity, anti-inflammatory, anti-allergic, and helps to tackle hypoglycaemia.”Loaded with fatty acids and antioxidants, seaweed masks can do wonders for your skin. “It also moisturises and calms the skin, as well as helps in fighting acne,” says Neetha Bhoopalam, natural cosmetologist and aromatherapy expert. To prepare this mask, mix seaweed powder with water and add a few drops of lavender essential oil to it. Then apply the paste on the face and neck; wash it off after 20 minutes.“Commercial farming of seaweeds in coastal habitats could lead to C-sequestration (removal and sequestration of carbon dioxide from theatmosphere),” says Dr A Gopalakrishnan, Director at Indian Council of Agricultural Research-CMFRI. This means that apart from being asustainable source of food, seaweed could play a role in tackling climate change too. Globally, seaweed is currently grown on a small scale for use in food, medicines, and beauty products. Scientists have proposed establishing industrial-size farms to grow seaweed and sink it in the deep ocean. The carbon stored in its tissues would then remain buried.The extraction of bioactive components from seaweed for potential health benefit is an emerging area of research, according to Dr Gopalakrishnan. The Indian Council for Agricultural Research has already developed a few products as green alternatives for synthetic drugs to combat rheumatoid arthritis and Type-2 diabetes.",life-style,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74334191,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-1644648/74334191.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//life-style/food-news/seaweed-is-a-lot-more-than-just-exotic-food/articleshow/74334191.cms

PANAJI: The moment Yash Fadte won the French Junior Open crown, a thought struck his mind.

He had seen pictures of sporting stars celebrating their triumphs in front of iconic places, and for someone who had picked up his medal in Lille, Eiffel Tower , a magnificent iron structure that illuminates Paris, was not too far behind. He made a trip to see the wonder of the world, and posed gleefully with his shiny medal in front of the 324 meters high monument.

French Junior Open is among the three more prestigious squash tournaments in the world and pales only in comparison to the British Open and US Open. Yash, 18, has won the US Open in the past and made it to the quarterfinals of the British Open this year. But he’s really chasing just one title since breaking into Asia’s top-10 a few years ago: Worlds.

“All that I have really wanted is to become a world champion. That’s what I am fighting for all these years. I want to be known as the world’s best (junior) squash player,” Yash told TOI on Thursday.

Yash has the credentials. He is Asia’s top-ranked player, never mind his loss against compatriot Veer Chotrani – training in the United States – in the Asian Junior Squash Championship. He finds himself in the top-five players in the world, with the top three from heavyweight Egypt. He’s defeated Louis Anderson, ranked World No. 4, at the US Open and believes he can make the best of his final year in the junior circuit when the WSF World Junior Championships is held in Australia from July 19.

“This is a crucial year for me. I’ve focused all my energy into training to be the best, but sometimes I am left to wonder, why I do not get as much support as everyone else. Why am I being punished for no fault of mine?” said Yash.

That support, or the lack of it, is clearly from the state government. While the Sports Authority of Goa (SAG) has been known to be the most generous and distributes funds to sportspersons almost on a whim, Yash has never ever benefitted. Despite being the best in Asia, despite his achievements around the world and despite showing he can conquer the best in business.

“We are releasing him the prize money immediately. His funds were stuck because the association did not complete the registration formalities but now, we are making an exception for him,” said SAG executive director VM Prabhu Desai.

Claims that Yash is paying for the faults of the association hasn’t found many takers. Last month when Yash went to the SAG headquarters, he was told that one crucial document was missing from his file. When he opened the file and looked himself, the document was right there, while officials sat on the file for nothing.

“Yash has won so many medals and brought so many honours to Goa. He should have been our pride and neighbours envy. Yet, the state has rarely recognised his achievements by giving him cash awards or financial incentives. Most of his grants documents are lying in SAG due to procedural hassles. Reminds me of the famous Munnabhai MBBS movie dialogue, ""yeh form bharna zaroori hai kya?,” asks sports enthusiast and Goa Badminton Association secretary Sandeep Heble.

The SAG knows better.

Panaji: When India coach Igor Stimac landed in Goa to watch a crucial I-League game last week, he dialled a few numbers and sought to meet players who had impressed him.

The first on his list was Jackichand Singh and soon another message was sent. He wanted to have a word with Seriton Fernandes too. Both Jackichand and Seriton promptly showed up at the hotel in South Goa and after half an hour’s discussion, left with a smile on their face.

Jackichand’s form this season, particularly in the last few games, has been terrific for FC Goa, while Seriton has been the most consistent performer. For two seasons now, he has been an automatic choice at right-back for the Goan club. The last game that he sat out due to suspension was his first after playing in a record 46 consecutive matches.

When Stimac announced his teams previously, Seriton was a surprise omission. Fans felt he at least deserved a call to attend the national camp Now, Seriton has the chance to impress after being summoned to attend the camp ahead of the World Cup qualifier against Qatar on March 26.

Another Goan, Liston Colaco , has also been summoned to the senior team for the first time. The sharpshooter hardly got a chance when with FC Goa, but his move to Hyderabad FC saw him play more regularly and he even scored a brace against NorthEast United FC.

Stimac has called up 23 players for the national camp from March 9 from the Indian Super League (ISL) teams who have failed to qualify for the playoffs this season. Another 20 players will join after the ISL final on March 14, or if their teams get knocked out earlier.

Several interesting names have made it to the list. There is a return for veteran goalkeeper Subhashish Roy Chowdhury, while young goalkeeper Rafique Ali Sardar also gets his maiden call-up after impressing for Jamshedpur FC.

Pratik Chowdhary (Mumbai City FC), Shubham Sarangi, Jerry Mawihmingthanga, Nandhakumar Sekar (Odisha FC), Lalengmawia (NorthEast United) and Jeakson Singh (Kerala Blasters) are among the other players who have caught the eye.

Meanwhile, injured players like Sandesh Jhingan and Jeje Lalpekhlua have also been asked to report to the national camp where they will undergo fitness tests. Having been out of action for a long time, neither of them are expected to make it to the final team.",goa,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-47529300,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-110164,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/national-coach-to-have-a-look-at-seriton-liston/articleshow/74347393.cms

Panaji: The moment Yash Fadte won the French Junior Open crown, a thought struck his mind.

He had seen pictures of sporting stars celebrating their triumphs in front of iconic places, and for someone who had picked up his medal in Lille, Eiffel Tower, a magnificent iron structure that illuminates Paris, was not too far behind. He made a trip to see the wonder of the world, and posed gleefully with his shiny medal in front of the 324 meters high monument.

French Junior Open is among the three more prestigious squash tournaments in the world and pales only in comparison to the British Open and US Open. Yash, 18, has won the US Open in the past and made it to the quarterfinals of the British Open this year. But he’s really chasing just one title since breaking into Asia’s top-10 a few years ago: Worlds.

“All that I have really wanted is to become a world champion. That’s what I am fighting for all these years. I want to be known as the world’s best (junior) squash player,” Yash told TOI on Thursday.

Yash has the credentials. He is Asia’s top-ranked player, never mind his loss against compatriot Veer Chotrani – training in the United States – in the Asian Junior Squash Championship. He finds himself in the top-five players in the world, with the top three from heavyweight Egypt.

17,['28/02/2020'],Gabriella Demetriades: I don’t think you necessarily have to get married. There is no ‘one way’ to always do something,"Gabriella Demetriades came to Mumbai from South Africa to fulfil her dreams of starting a fashion line. Little did she know that this city would become her home, and she would comfortably settle down here with a partner and child. While she made a splash in the modelling world, she even did brief roles in a few Indian movies. In the midst of this, she happened to meet Arjun Rampal and their relationship blossomed over time. Around April 2019, they surprised everyone when Arjun posted a lovely picture him with Gabriella showing her baby bump, with the message, “Blessed to have you and start all over again…thank you baby for this baby.” Now, while Gabriella is busy expanding her clothing line, she is also a hands-on mommy to 7-month-old baby boy, Arik. In a candid chat with Bombay Times, she talks about how she met Arjun, her thoughts on marriage and way she’s made India her home. Excerpts:

What drew you to pack your bags and move to India?

I’ve always had this ambition to be a successful fashion designer, like my mother. I began as an assistant stylist in South Africa. Later, a photographer spotted me and told me that I should try modeling. I looked at it as an opportunity to make money which I could use to fund my business. It was also a gateway to making contacts with people associated with the business, like models, photographers and other designers. During the process, I happened to meet someone from an Indian modeling agency in South Africa. He told me that I should come down to India as I would get great modeling opportunities here.

So, your prime motivation was to set up your fashion line, and not you’re your way into Bollywood as an actress? In the past, women from other countries have come to India to pursue a career in the movies.

Acting and Bollywood were never my aspiration, but fashion was. When I came to Mumbai, I didn’t even know what Bollywood was. While I was doing modelling here, my agent suggested that I try acting in a Bollywood movie. I had heard about the creepy side of Bollywood with women facing bad experiences here. I was aware of it and was careful. When I was offered Sonali Cable (2014), I took the plunge. I liked the treatment that I received from the Sippy family (Ramesh and Rohan Sippy, the makers of the film). I had a great time with my co-stars on the set, too. I loved being in front of the camera, but the glitch was the language. I am very bad at learning new languages. Getting the lines of a foreign language right, with hundreds of people staring at you, is very scary. I thought that maybe this is not where I was supposed to be. But before deciding to quit movies, I wanted to be sure. So, I went did a film down South with Nagarjuna and Tamannaah (Oopiri, 2016). It was an amazing experience, but language continued to be a big barrier. Finally, I bid adieu to movies. I am a creative person and like to be busy. To sit on the set and wait for the shot is not my cup of tea. While all this was happening, I started my clothing line, which grew over a period of time.



While you were focusing on chasing your dreams here, when did you meet Arjun Rampal?

We have a few mutual friends, so, I would end up meeting him at social occasions along the way. The first time I met him was in 2018. We kind of hit it off from there. And with time, the relationship blossomed into something meaningful. Arjun is a gentleman. Our love for work, creativity, ambition and fitness are the things that we have in common. We both are also very family oriented.

Arjun is an actor and a producer, has there been any discussion on you getting back to movies?

He tells me that I am a bad actor (laughs!). I doubt he has seen any of my movies. In fact, he has been very supportive towards my fashion endeavour. He has been a supermodel himself for many years and is incredibly stylish. He has a great taste in fashion. He is always on the lookout for what I am making and wearing. I value his opinion. Having said that, we don't mix our workspace or interfere in each other’s profession.

You hail from South Africa. How is Arjun helping you to adapt to the culture and life in Mumbai?

Since I am from another country, I would feel lost and left out during the festive season, as I couldn't understand what was going on. Arj is a proud Indian and he celebrates all festivals. It is only after I started spending time with him that I celebrated Holi, Diwali and other festivals. Before that, I was clueless about these celebrations. What I like about India is that it embraces and accommodates people from all over the world.

You fondly call him Arj, what does he call you?

(Laughs!) This is a South African thing. We kind of abbreviate everything. Back home, my family and friends call me Gab. Arjun doesn't call me Gab, as he loves my name, so he calls me Gabriella.

Arjun and you decided to have a child without tying the knot. This is still a rare in our country. Weren’t you worried about societal pressures?

We wanted to keep things private. Also, I am very different in that sense. I don’t think you necessarily have to get married. I think there is no ‘one way’ to always do something; to each their own. Yes, there is societal pressure, but personal choices are important. When it comes to deciding what gender you want to be, who you want to date or marry, it should be left to the individual or individuals concerned. Just like in other parts of the world, people here, too, are opening up and accepting others’ choices. I have always been accepting of others and their choices, so hopefully, the world will accept mine.

What do you think about the institution of marriage?

I don’t have a strong opinion about it. It is just my choice. I don’t think we need to be so serious about everything. I don’t think love is something that needs a definition or a rulebook. Times are changing and people are more accepting today. I don’t think that people are categorising any one particular way of living as the right way anymore.

What are Arjun’s thoughts on this? Have you discussed tying the knot, if not right away, but probably someday?

It is a topic that doesn't really come up between us.

You named your son Arik, who came up with the name Arik?

Arik is a Hindu name, which in Sanskrit means ruler of rulers. We were looking for a name that’s easy to pronounce. I think it is a very strong name that is short and easy to pronounce for my family and friends, who are not from India. I wanted to name him Ari, which is a Hebrew name. Then, Arjun came up with the name Arik.

Are both of your very hands-on with him?

Motherhood, it is a full-time job, and I am happy about how Arjun and I divide the work when it comes to the baby and help each other out.",entertainment,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74335240,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-97843/74335240.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/hindi/bollywood/news/gabriella-demetriades-i-dont-think-you-necessarily-have-to-get-married-there-is-no-one-way-to-always-do-something/articleshow/74335240.cms

India hasn’t been immune to the Parasite wave that swept the awards season this year. Though Parasite is the first South Korean film that got a theatre release in India, South Korean films are already quite popular among Indians, thanks to OTT platforms. When Parasite won the Golden Globe Award for Best Foreign Language Film, in his acceptance speech, director Bong Joon Ho, told the crowd through his translator Sharon Choi, “Once you overcome the one-inch-tall barrier of subtitles, you will be introduced to so many more amazing films.” It seems that movie buffs in India overcame this one-inch-tall-barrier long ago.From OTT platforms to Delhi’s pirated film markets and now to the cinemas, it seems Korean films have a huge following in India. The Korean Cultural Centre in Delhi vouches for this and says they get a huge turnout when the screen Korean film. Kim Kum-Pyoung, Director, Korean Cultural Center India, says, “Korean films and dramas are getting popular in India through OTT platforms. Many youngsters watch Korean dramas and films on these platforms. Keeping the popularity in mind, the Korean Cultural Centre is now running weekly movie screenings. Apart from that, we are supporting Korean films’ screening at various film festivals.” An I&B official says, “In general, Korean films get a very good response. But when we screened Parasite at IFFI last year, moviegoers stood in line for three hours to watch it. And many were left disappointed because they couldn’t get an entry as the auditorium was packed. Hence, we had to organise a second screening of the film.”If you are looking for a Korean film which you couldn’t find on OTT platforms, there are high chances you’ll get it at the stores at Majnu Ka Tila. Namit Konsam, a seller at the market, says, “The highest demand for Korean films come from teens and DU students. The demand has gone up in the last two-three years. And these days, most of the customers are asking for Bong Joon Ho’s films, which are not available online.” A seller at Kamla Nagar says, “College students come to us with titles of these films, and we get those for them.” The most popular Korean films include Bong Joon Ho’s Mother and White Man.Debashish Saha, a DU student who came to Majnu Ka Tilla with a list of Korean films, tells us, “I feel that Korean films are more mature compared to what we have in Bollywood. I first saw a Korean film when one of my friends from the northeast showed it to me. And since that day I couldn’t stop watching them – be it teenage love stories or thrillers.” The Korean Cultural Centre also says that many youngsters are learning Korean language to understand the films, shows and music better. Sellers at Delhi’s movie piracy hubs – Kamla Nagar, Nehru Place and Kotla Mubarakpur – say that they are flooded with requests for South Korean movies. A seller in Kotla Mubarakpur says, “We charge the same price (Rs100) for Korean films and Hollywood films. Right now, Korean films are in huge demand. In fact, we sold more Korean films last year than we did in the previous years.” He adds, “In the last two months, customers have been asking for Parasite. But piracy laws have become so strict that we couldn’t get the film from anywhere.”",life-style,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74334412,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-367873/74334412.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//life-style/spotlight/even-before-parasite-korean-films-were-a-hit-in-delhi/articleshow/74333738.cms

A soothing rendition of ‘Vaishnava Jana To’ reverberates in the auditorium with iconic pictures of the real Bapu flashing on screen. From the very beginning, director Saif Hyder Hasan’s narrative abruptly jumps from one phase of Gandhi’s life to another, and a mishmash of information ensues. With limited room for movement, Zeenat Aman maneuvers through the verbose script. Arif Zakaria, on the the other hand, effortlessly replicates Gandhi’s body language and conveys a plethora of emotions without saying much.Marking Zeenat Aman’s comeback after 15 years on stage, ‘Dearest Bapu, Love Kasturba’, attempts to trace the historic events that transformed Gandhi into the Father of the Nation, and subtly recounts the marital woes that defined his relationship with Kasturba. “Marriage choked me… I learnt the concept of Satyagraha from you, my feisty better half,” confessed Gandhi. “I did not know how to deal with you… your ever-growing idealism clashed with my conservative upbringing,” complained the wife. Statements like these uncovered the lesser-known side of Bapu. Their intimate conversational letters, filled with poetic anecdotes, spoke of his experiments with physical pleasures of life. They highlighted the political unrest, his father’s death, Kasturba’s deteriorating health and a lot more through Arif’s portrayal of the endearing and humourous Gandhi.The constant banter that humanised these powerful figures was refreshing.

21,['28/02/2020'],"#CoronavirusOutbreak: Import of electronic items hit, Delhi markets see price increase","Electronic items in the popular markets of Delhi, which people visit to buy goods at inexpensive rates – including Gaffar Market, Palika Bazaar, Karol Bagh and Nehru Place – are seeing a distinct rise in prices. From replicas of the latest AirPods, Fitbit bands and watches to cheaper non-branded items, these markets are known for their Chinese goods. While the rising cost has left Delhiites disappointed, sellers say that they have no choice. The coronavirus outbreak means that there is a shortage of supply of goods from China, which, in turn, is leading to increased cost.The dealers and sellers are anticipating huge losses due to blockages in their supply chain. They tell us that if this continues, in a couple of weeks, it will be a crisis situation. Mikko, a seller in Karol Bagh, says, “All the major electronic markets of Delhi get over 80% of their items from China. From mobile phones and laptops to earphones and power banks, all the items are imported from China. We are refusing wholesale orders and are only catering to individual customers because we have stock left for 15-20 days.” Awadesh Sathpathy, who works for an event management company, says, “I go to Gaffar twice a week to order bulk items like headphones, bluetooth speakers and power banks for our events. But the sellers are not agreeing to sell over 40-50 items at one go as they say there is a scarcity in the market. Additionally, they have revised the rates.”Shoppers at Gaffar tell us that they’ve started feeling the impact when it comes to the price of items in the replica market. Gunjan Mallik, a shopper who was in Gaffar recently to buy a screen for iPhone, as she had to replace the old one, tells us, “I have checked almost 10 shops in Gaffar market and nobody is ready to sell it for below Rs3,000. My friends have bought the same screen for Rs900-1,500.” PP Prasad, a seller in Gaffar market, says, “Due to no supply from China, we have increased prices of these items. Some rates have been doubled, and items like replicas of iPhone screens, fitness watches – the main draw for buyers here – are being sold at Rs500-Rs1,000 more than their usual prices. The scale of impact on the sale of items in Gaffar market, in the long run, would depend on how long we’re unable to get items from China.” Rajat Kashyap, a corporate employee and a regular shopper at Gaffar, says, “The same earphones that I bought for Rs100 three-four months back are now being sold for Rs300. While it is still cheaper than what we get at branded outlets and online, but this is not Gaffar’s price.”Gaurav Bhagat, a managing director of a company selling electronic items for corporate gifting (in a retail shop and online), tells us, “We get a bulk of supplies from China of components used in the electronic items and these are our bestselling items. For example, the batteries we use in power banks come from China. So do the LED lighting accessories and bluetooth pods. As factories are shut in China, I am not sure when I will get my required stock. During the recently-concluded auto expo in Greater Noida, we were getting orders from auto companies for items like bluetooth pods and power banks for gifting purposes, but we are almost out of stock. If the situation doesn’t resolve in the next few days, there would be a shortage of affordable range of power banks, etc that sell the most in Delhi.” Several corporate offices are also feeling the heat. Mamta Desai, who works in a corporate firm in Gurgaon, says, “We have hosted three events in Gurgaon and Delhi recently, and when we contacted our vendors for the electronic gifts, they told us that the items are out of stock.

24,['28/02/2020'],Adaa Khan: True and unconditional love does not exist anymore,"For years, Adaa Khan ’s only focus was work. And then, a severe bout of illness opened her eyes to the fact that there is more to life than just work. ‘Tomorrow’, she realised, might never come; it’s all about capturing the beauty of each moment. It was after ‘ Naagin 2 ’ wrapped up, that Adaa fell sick and was bedridden following severe dehydration. However, despite being unwell, she was back in action with ‘ Vish Ya Amrit: Sitara ’. The actress shares, “Since I was shooting for ‘Sitara’ and ‘Kanpur Wale Khuranas’ at the same time while I was unwell, I did not get a chance to rejuvenate. That was when I realised that I haven’t done anything beyond work. I didn’t want to die thinking that maine kuchh nahi dekha life mein. I can either keep working and saving money for the future or live in the moment; I could either be wise about money or life. I chose the latter.”Now, Adaa takes time out in between projects to pursue her passion for travel. In fact, in the last three months, she has travelled extensively. She says, “When I fell ill, it was like a moment of truth for me, I realised the need to pursue my other interests. So, after ‘Sitara’ wrapped up, I took off to see Europe. When I went to Bulgaria for the shoot of ‘ Khatron Ke Khiladi ’ (‘KKK’), I extended my trip by 10 days and also travelled to Italy and Switzerland, as I didn’t want to return home so early (smiles). I have also been to Malaysia, Dubai and most recently, Maldives. Life has taught me that self-love is more important than anything else. I love and pamper myself and do what I want to do. I have evolved as an individual and learnt my lessons, and I think that it’s been for the better. I don’t regret anything that has happened in my life, because I know that God has better plans for me. If those things hadn’t happened, I wouldn’t have experienced what I am experiencing now.”Of course, enjoying life is important, but isn’t she worried that such absences will affect her career? She replies, “Of course, as an artiste, it’s important to be seen on screen. Actors have a short shelf-life and people tend to forget you if you are away for long. Besides, the competition is also fierce. But in my case, with ‘KKK’ going on air, I could afford to not take up another show.”On the personal front, Adaa was in the news for her relationship with Ankit Gera going kaput a few years ago. Talking about what she thinks of love and marriage today, she says, “Everyone is taking love for granted. For that matter, even friendships are taken for granted. Today, it’s all about gaining something, and I don’t like that selfish aspect of friendships and relationships. For me, love is about being loyal to your partner. However, now that everything is so easily available, true and unconditional love doesn’t exist anymore.”She adds, “Marriage is a huge risk and I don’t believe in it. At this point, I don’t wish to settle down, but I can’t predict the future. If I find the right person, I will think about it. As of now, I am happy being single and doing what I am doing and enjoying my life. One doesn’t need to look outside for happiness, it comes from within.”",tv,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74337943,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-48399/74337943.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//tv/news/hindi/adaa-khan-true-and-unconditional-love-does-not-exist-anymore/articleshow/74337846.cms

26,['28/02/2020'],nirmala gokhale: ‘Get down or drive over me!’,"video of a retired teacher scolding bikers to get off the pavement went viral recently, with over 377k views. Fed up with bikers riding on the pavement of Canal Road, off Law College Road,Nirmala Gokhale, in her 70s, took things into her own hands, instead of waiting for the authorities to intervene. “We are all well aware of our rights, but we aren’t aware of our responsibilities,” she says, adding with a smile, “I wasn’t even aware that somebody was taking a video. It was only the next day that I got a call from my relatives saying you are in the news and that’s when I found out.”Recalling the day when the incident happened, she says, “That day, the traffic was really bad and I was trying to cross the road. Amidst that, there were two-wheeler riders getting on the pavement just to get ahead in the traffic. They were honking behind me and in front of me and I was completely stuck. I immediately turned around and started asking each of them to get off the footpath and ride on the road.” She adds that though some riders asked her to get out of their way, she stood strong and kept repeating, “If you want to ride on the pavement, then you will have to ride over me.”Riding on footpaths is an issue not just in Pune, but across the country. And very often, senior citizens and children find themselves at risk because of this. “One of my friends was once hit by a two wheeler rider who was riding on the footpath. She was majorly injured and had to undergo surgery. And that rider was so inhuman that he didn’t event stop to check on her. The pavement is for people to walk – not just senior citizens but for everyone – so why would do people ride there and take away that space from us?” she asks.Nirmala also emphasises that it’s not only youngsters who behave like this. “That day, I saw people of every age group doing the same thing. From youngsters to older citizens – they were all trying to get on the footpath. When children see their parents breaking rules, they will automatically learn that. Blaming youngsters alone is not fair,” Nirmala explains.Her husband Prabhakar Gokhale, who is proud of his wife for standing up against those who break the rules, feels that she should continue to do this when she comes across people breaking traffic rules. “People are scared of women in charge. That’s why they got off the foothpath when they saw how angry she was. Instead of Nirmala, if I had done the same thing, people would not have listened. They would probably have pushed me away. But you cannot do that to a woman. Nothing can be more powerful than a woman and such women can bring a change in the country,” he says.",life-style,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74336192,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-329385/74336192.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//life-style/spotlight/get-down-or-drive-over-me/articleshow/74336177.cms

30,['28/02/2020'],Supreme Court to consider revisiting ‘Hindutva’ definition case,"This story is from February 28, 2020

NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Thursday said it would expedite hearing on a pending petition seeking revisiting the court’s earlier definition of ‘ Hindutva ’ as a way of life and hear arguments for and against the plea from certain quarters to disqualify candidates if they made use of ‘Hindutva’ to seek votes.

A bench headed by Chief Justice S A Bobde said it would hear the petition after completion of arguments in the faith versus fundamental rights case arising from pleas seeking review of the SC’s judgment striking down the religious custom banning entry of women in the 10-50 year age group into Sabarimala Ayyappa temple in Kerala.

CJI Bobde said the nine-judge bench led by him, and comprising Justices R Banumathi, Ashok Bhushan, L Nageswara Rao, Mohan M Shantanagoudar, S Abdul Nazeer, R Subhash Reddy, B R Gavai and Surya Kant, would resume hearing the Sabarimala case on a day-to-day basis from March 16. The hearing was derailed because one of the judges was down with swine flu .

In the case relating to Abhiram Singh, pending since 1992, senior advocate Arvind Datar said several candidates had been acquitted in the electoral malpractices case relating to the 1990 Maharashtra assembly polls. “But my client Abhiram Singh is stuck with the case as the petition was referred to a three-judge bench, then to a five-judge bench and finally to a seven-judge bench which decided to expand the scope and ambit of disqualification of a candidate for seeking votes by appealing to religion, race, caste, community or language of his own, his rival candidates or electors,” he said.

When Datar sought early hearing on Abhiram Singh’s petition, CJI Bobde said the opposite side wanted the court to revisit the definition of ‘Hindutva’. “Their prayer is to offset the ‘Hindutva’ judgment. It will take time as long arguments are expected on the issue. We will try to hear this petition after completing hearing in the Sabarimala case,” he said.

On December 11, 1995, in the Ramesh Yeshwant Prabhoo case, SC had ruled that mere use of the words ‘Hindutva’ or ‘Hinduism’ in an election speech would not attract the rigour of disqualification under Section 123(3) of the Representation of the People Act. “Mere use of the word ‘Hindutva’ or ‘Hinduism' or mention of any other religion in an election speech does not bring it within the net of sub-section (3) and/or sub-section (3A) of Section 123, unless the further elements indicated are also present in that speech,” the SC had said.

“No precise meaning can be ascribed to the terms ‘Hindu', ‘Hindutva' and ‘Hinduism', and no meaning in the abstract can confine it to the narrow limits of religion alone, excluding the content of Indian culture and heritage. It is also indicated that the term ‘Hindutva' is related more to the way of life of the people in the subcontinent,” the court held.

The court had said, “It is difficult to appreciate how in the face of these decisions, the term ‘Hindutva' or ‘Hinduism' per se, in the abstract, can be assumed to mean and be equated with narrow fundamentalist Hindu religious bigotry, or be construed to fall within the prohibition in sub-sections (3) and/or (3A) of Section 123,” it had said.

NEW DELHI: The telecom department is working on at least three options to defer the Rs 1.47 lakh crore adjusted gross revenue (AGR) liability of telecom companies, including proposals to let the operators pay around 20% of the outstanding amount upfront.The proposals are among several measures to be discussed on Friday by the Digital Communications Commission (DCC), the inter-ministerial panel comprising top officials, that could provide much-needed relief to beleaguered telcos such as Vodafone Idea and Airtel .A decision on the extent and modalities of a bailout would depend on the view taken by officials from other ministries, especially finance and DoT can only come up with recommendations.“A variety of options are being worked upon. We are walking a tightrope as while adherence to the SC order is a top priority, there is also a need to see that the industry doesn’t end up as a monopoly, or even a duopoly,” a source told TOI.The first option being considered by DoT hinges on payment of 20% of the principal licence fee and the spectrum usage charges that are part of the AGR liability. If the proposal is accepted, the remaining amount will have to be paid over 16 years and will come annual interest rate that is 0.5% higher than what a comparable government security costs. Besides, there will be a five year moratorium on principal and interest payment.The second option is an improvement over the first option and includes issue bonds and warrants, after the initial payment of 20%. Once this is done, a part of the liability will be converted into bonds based on the self-assessed value by telecom companies. The other component – the difference between the self-assessed value and DoT’s claims – will come in the form of convertible warrants that companies will have to issue, sources explained.Once the amount is reconciled after audit, the warrants will be converted into bonds, in case there is additional liability.Another option on the table is to have an arrangement between the government, the telecom companies and banks, which provide funds against the bonds issued by the telecom companies. The money will then be used to settle the AGR dues and the funds will be set aside in a separate account so that banks have a charge on it.In case of a default, the government’s rights over the claims can be protected through subrogation rights over the bonds, suggested a source.As the bonds are redeemed, the government will be able to collect an equivalent amount from the security account. And, if telecom companies default, banks can recover the amount from the security account.",business,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74349688,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-63624,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/dot-working-on-3-options-for-telco-bailout/articleshow/74349454.cms

Leading Democratic presidential hopeful Bernie Sanders attacked US President Donald Trump for failure on human rights leadership, saying Trump’s comment that handling the unrest over the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) was up to India was inadequate.Sanders tweeted on Wednesday, “Over 200 million Muslims call India home. Widespread anti-Muslim mob violence has killed at least 27 and injured many more. Trump responds by saying, ‘That’s up to India’. This is a failure of leadership on human rights.” Sanders took on Trump for his reaction at the press meet here on questions about the clashes.In a milder reaction, supportive of the Indian government, a senior US state department official also tweeted on the violence in Delhi, urging calm and respect for the right of peaceful assembly. “Our hearts go out to the families of the deceased and injured in New Delhi,” Alice G Wells, principal deputy assistant secretary for south and central Asian affairs at the state department, tweeted on Thursday.“We echo PM Narendra Modi’s call for calm and normalcy and urge all parties to maintain peace, refrain from violence and respect the right of peaceful assembly,” she wrote.BJP general secretary (organisation) B L Santhosh responded to Sanders’s tweet on Thursday and said his party may be “compelled” to play a role in the US presidential elections coming up later this year. He, however, soon deleted his tweet.Santhosh posted a sharp reaction at 7.45am on Thursday, saying, “How much ever neutral we wish to be, you compel us to play a role in the presidential elections.

NEW DELHI: With more bodies being recovered from drains and people in hospitals dying of injuries, the death toll in the north-east Delhi communal riots rose to 38 on Thursday. However, no incident of violence has been reported since Tuesday night and life is slowly returning to normal. Prohibitory orders imposed under Section 144 will be relaxed for 10 hours on Friday in view of the improvement in the ground situation.Delhi Police has arrested over 130 people, detained over 400 and registered 48 FIRs. It has also booked Aam Aadmi Party councillor Tahir Hussain and his associates in the case of murder of Intelligence Bureau official Ankit Sharma. He is yet to be arrested. Sharma’s case, along with other cases of riots, have been transferred to the crime branch and a special investigation team (SIT) — as reported by TOI on Thursday — has been set up to probe the case.Delhi violence: Live updatesThe SIT will also probe a “larger conspiracy”, which cops suspect was hatched over a period. Their suspicion has been strengthened by the recoveries made from the area which include improvised hand grenades tied with rope and “bottle bomb launchers” which resemble a big-size slingshot tied to trees or fences to make it look like swings. These arrangements could not have been made overnight, said a source.Meanwhile, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal announced on Thursday that Delhi government will bear all medical expenses of the riot victims even if they are admitted to private hospitals and give up to Rs 10 lakh as compensation to the kin of the dead and up to Rs 5 lakh each to those who have lost their houses and shops in the riots. Eighteen subdivisional magistrates (SDMs) have been deployed to monitor the relief and rehabilitation operations.The Delhi LG on Thursday reviewed the situation and directed the police to ensure continued and adequate deployment of force apart from carrying out enhanced patrolling and area domination exercises.Four teams of Delhi FSL — physics, biology, chemistry and photo — visited several spots in the area to lift samples. The authorities will now make efforts for quick disposal of burnt vehicles, lifting of malba, clearing of animal carcasses and repair of roads, signages, government assets and religious structures, in coordination with the police.“The LG has also asked for setting up of sufficient number of shelter homes with basic amenities, including beddings, blankets, medicines, food, sanitation and clean drinking water, ensuring timely medico-legal certificates and post-mortem reports etc. to the victims and their families,” said a government official. The principal secretary (law) was asked to coordinate with the district legal services authorities to provide immediate legal aid to the victims.Arrangements are being made in coordination with IHBAS for counselling of riot victims to treat those with post-traumatic stress disorder and any other issues. The LG has also asked the revenue department to adopt confidence-building measures and make a quick survey of the quantum of loss to individuals, families, business establishments, shops and institutions and ensure speedy compensation.Special CP Sundari Nanda, assisted by East Delhi Municipal Corporation officials, health department and district administration, will meet the injured and families of the deceased personally and ensure that all steps are taken to provide them help.Delhi Police has appealed to people residing in north-east Delhi that if they had witnessed violent incidents, they should come forward and share their ordeal and videos with the police.

State home minister Anil Deshmukh said that the Maha Vikas Aghadi government had withdrawn 348 cases. (File Ph... Read More

MUMBAI: State home minister Anil Deshmukh said on Thursday that the Maha Vikas Aghadi government had withdrawn 348 cases out of a total of 649 filed in connection with the Koregaon Bhima violence. The other cases were in the process (of being withdrawn), he said, clarifying that only those cases which involved attacks on the police and damage to property would not be withdrawn.

The government has also promised to withdraw cases filed in connection with various protests such as the Maratha reservation agitation, opposition to the Nanar oil refinery project, farmers’ stir and the Dhangar reservation agitation.

Deshmukh said this in the legislative council during his reply to questions raised by members of the Congress and NCP and some independents about the Elgar Parishad and Koregaon Bhima cases. He reiterated that though the state government has the right to probe the Koregaon Bhima violence and the Elgar cases, it will examine whether there is a provision in the Maharashtra Police Act which would allow it to initiate a parallel inquiry into the Elgar case in order to check if people have been falsely framed. Deshmukh specified that the state has the right to conduct an inquiry if investigation has been carried out in the wrong manner.

The minister said that the home department has received many memorandums on the matter, pointing out that the FIR in the Elgar case has been registered against the “wrong people” and against “those who did not follow the ideology of the erstwhile (BJP) government.”

Sharad Ranpise, a Congress MLC, pointed out that people had been falsely framed by the investigating agency. Kapil Patil, an independent MLC, urged the government to withdraw cases registered against a few people like Anand Teltumbde . “Will the state government initiate a parallel inquiry into the Elgar Parishad case to reveal the truth and provide security to these people who were framed by terming them as ‘Urban Naxals’?” Patil asked.

Deshmukh said the state has the right to probe both cases if the investigation had proceeded in the wrong direction and added the state would check if it could initiate a “parallel probe.”

47,['28/02/2020'],Bihar now passes resolution seeking caste-based Census,"This story is from February 28, 2020

File photo used for representation.

PATNA: The Bihar assembly on Thursday unanimously passed a resolution demanding a caste-based census in 2021.

The move comes just two days after the 243-member House unanimously passed a resolution stating that National Register of Citizens (NRC) is “not needed in Bihar” while also emphasizing that the state would stick to the 2010 proforma for National Population Register (NPR) and add only a new column for transgenders.

Bihar is the second assembly in the country seeking a caste-based census in 2021. On January 8, the Maharashtra assembly had passed a similar resolution.

The twin resolutions on NRC-NPR and caste-based census are being seen in political circles as part of a strategy by Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar to ensure that his party, the JD(U), plays a dominant role in the assembly elections later this year vis-à-vis its ally, the BJP. Nitish has been emphasizing the need for a caste-based census arguing that it is required to increase the percentage of SC/ST and OBC quotas which is currently capped at 50% as per a Supreme Court verdict.

Cutting across party lines, legislators thumped their desks and welcomed the resolution for caste-based census, which was moved by speaker Vijay Kumar Choudhary himself. “The last time the country had a caste-based census was in 1931. Several decades have since passed and it has now become necessary to hold a similar census again,” Nitish said in the House.

Nitish said both the assembly and the legislative council had in 2013 passed a resolution on the need for a caste-based census. He added that in the last census, the socio-economic survey and caste enumeration were done in 2011 for a “limited purpose” and were found to be “flawed”.

The issue of a caste-based population enumeration attracted a lot of attention in the 2015 assembly polls when the alliance of JD(U), RJD and Congress defeated NDA.

While BJP supported Thursday’s resolution – just like it had backed the NRC-NPR resolution two days ago – the party’s minister, Nand Kishore Yadav, told mediapersons that there was “nothing new” in the resolution. “Earlier too, the House had passed a similar resolution,” he said. Though BJP had backed the resolution, its MLC Sachchidanand Rai said such a move can divide the society further.

On expected lines, RJD welcomed the resolution. “It’s a historical fact that the social and spatial demarcation within India exists even today. SCs/STs/OBCs have been deprived socially and economically for ages,” leader of the opposition in the assembly, Tejashwi Yadav, tweeted hours after the House adopted the resolution. “Caste-based census will provide a radical ground at the policy level for greater social and economic reforms,” he added.

48,['28/02/2020'],Jaish case accused gets bail as NIA fails to file chargesheet,"This story is from February 28, 2020

File image used for representation

NEW DELHI/SRINAGAR: One of the accused in the Jaish-e-Muhammed (JeM) conspiracy case, Yusuf Chopan , has been granted bail by a special court on the grounds that the National Investigation Agency (NIA) did not file a chargesheet within the stipulated period. He has, however, been rearrested under the Public Safety Act and sent to a Jammu prison .

Though some media reports suggested that Chopan was granted bail in the Pulwama attack case , the NIA dismissed these and said a “breakthrough” in the Pulwama case was expected soon.

The NIA released a clarification pointing out that he was never arrested in the Pulwama case. “He, along with six others, was arrested in the JeM conspiracy case where two chargesheets were filed against eight accused,” the NIA said. It also released the names of the accused persons — Sajad Ahmad Khan, Tanveer Ahmed Gani, Bilal Ahmed Mir, Muzaffar Ahmed Bhat, Ishfaq Ahmed Bhat, Mehrajuddin Chopan, Mudassir Ahmed Khan and Kari Mufti Yaseer.

Mudassir and Yaseer were killed in encounters, the NIA said, adding, “Yusuf Chopan was not chargesheeted due to inadequate evidence.”

“As such, he has been granted default bail by the special NIA court in New Delhi on 18.02.2020 and he has been sent back to Kot Bhalwal Jail, Jammu, under the Public Safety Act by order of the DM, Pulwama,” the NIA statement reads.

The NIA highlighted that significant leads have emerged during investigations in the Pulwama attack case and a “breakthrough” was expected shortly.

Special NIA judge Praveen Singh granted the reprieve to Yusuf Chopan on February 18, observing that he was entitled to statutory bail. “I find that the investigating agency has failed to file a chargesheet within the statutory period. The accused is entitled to statutory bail. The accused is accordingly admitted to bail subject to furnishing a personal bond in the sum of Rs 50,000 with one surety in the like amount,” the court held.

Chopan’s counsel submitted that his client had been in custody for about 180 days and the time for filing a chargesheet had elapsed. Statutory bail was, therefore, sought.

The NIA submitted that 180 days — the period for investigation in respect of the accused — was completed on February 11, 2020. Owing to insufficient evidence, the chargesheet could not be filed, it added. The NIA, however, said the investigation would continue under relevant provisions of law.

The case pertains to an alleged criminal conspiracy to strengthen the base of the proscribed JeM in India, raising funds for terrorist acts, conspiring to carry out terrorist acts, organising terrorists acts, organising terrorist camps and recruiting persons to carry out terrorist acts as well as harbouring JeM cadres and becoming members of the outfit.

KOLKATA: A queer-disability fashion show is set to be held in Kolkata, featuring models beyond gender, ability and age stereotypes, at a sports bar in Sector V, which has a safe space for the LGBTIQ community. The Civilian Welfare Foundation will organize ‘Rainbow Sunday’, where queer models and para-athletes will share the ramp.

Saheb Hussain, a model and a national record holder in blind 100m race, is thrilled to be part of the show. “I never imagined I would walk on a ramp with models with alternative sexualities. This is something that will dispel homophobia,” Hussain said.

Atar Ali, a make-up artist and the fastest 400m disabled runner in Bengal , will help the participants look glamorous. “Sports is my passion and make up is my profession. I will be able to do both,” Ali added.

Wheelchair-basketball player Pritam feels his beloved Kolkata is not inclusive when it comes to para-athletes. “Para-athletes and people from the LGBTQI community are often looked down upon here. I hope this initiative will change the outlook,” Pritam said.

Fashion designer Debarati Guha has special outfits in mind for each participant. For Ronia, who is disabled, she has selected a pastel pink sari paired with a turban. Kolaj will be sporting a sari, while Ujjal, a para-cyclist, will go topless with a Dhakai draped as his lower garment along with ghungru on his feet. “This is an important show for me. Not only will it break barriers, but my collection will be donned by these special personalities,” Guha said.

City-based band, The ASP Project, has volunteered to perform at the event.

52,['28/02/2020'],SAT allows lenders to sell Reliance General Insurance,"This story is from February 28, 2020

(Representative image)

MUMBAI: In a victory for Reliance Home Finance’s lenders Nippon India Mutual Fund and Credit Suisse , the Securities Appellate Tribunal ( SAT ) has upheld their right to sell shares of Reliance General Insurance following invocation of a pledge. The Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority ( Irdai ) had earlier declared the pledge enforcement as invalid since the regulator’s nod was not sought and the transfer violated foreign investment norms.

The tribunal, however, said after identifying a buyer for Reliance General Insurance, the proposed owner will have to be certified fit and proper by Irdai, which will carry out a due diligence and ascertain the prospective buyer’s financial soundness.

Nippon India MF and Credit Suisse are likely to invite bids for Reliance General Insurance, whose shares are held by IDBI Trusteeship. Current foreign direct investment norms prohibit non-residents from owning more than 49% in an insurer.

Nippon India and Credit Suisse argued before SAT that they enforced the pledge in accordance with the share pledge agreement to safeguard their interest and not to take control of the company. Nippon India also submitted that, in any case, it cannot control or manage any other business apart from mutual fund according to Sebi norms.

Nippon India was represented by counsel Pradeep Sancheti and Sumit Agrawal of RegStreet Law Advisors, while Credit Suisse was represented by counsel Janak Dwarkadas and law firm Juris Corp. The case dates back to March 2018, when Reliance Home Finance issued bonds worth Rs 400 crore and Rs 1,200 crore to Nippon India and Credit Suisse respectively. After Reliance Home Finance defaulted on its debt obligations, the two invoked the pledge (of Reliance General shares) made by Reliance Home Finance’s promoter, Reliance Capital.

In November, the Delhi high court had prevented Reliance Capital from selling any of its assets. Another debenture trustee Vistra ITCL sought to intervene in SAT, claiming it held a prior charge on Reliance General shares. It was, however, told to approach an appropriate forum for its case.

Officers conduct a route march in Entally

KOLKATA: In the aftermath of the violence in Delhi, Kolkata Police has started forming volunteer groups with members of different religious communities and tasking them with spreading the message of peace and harmony in their neighbourhoods. They have also been advised to inform cops about any outsider movement or informal meetings in their locali-ties that may provoke religious sentiments.

Over the past two days, officers of multiple police stations across Kolkata have organized route marches, beat meetings and door-to-door visits to several pockets to ensure peace and harmony are maintained. They are also keeping a close watch on every gathering in neighbourhoods to ensure no clash-provoking comments are made in public.

“We are focussing on the neighbourhoods with a mixed population of Hindu and Muslim communities and those areas that have a history of communal riots in the city. We are hand-picking volunteers and have asked them to spread the message of love and harmony among themselves and also report to the local police station about any incident of mass provocation at local tea shops, outside temples, mosques and even in areas of social gathering, like parks,” said a senior officer of Kolkata Police.

The state police top brass has also issued an advisory to all police stations to step up vigil in their areas to prevent rumour-mongering and hold peace meetings to ensure that the law-and-order situation doesn’t worsen. Acting on the directive, officers have started holding route marches, peace meetings and intensified night vigil in sensitive neighbourhoods, like Entally, Beniapukur, Cossipore, Kidderpore , Tollygunge and Charu Market.

“For the past two days, we have been constantly holding interactive sessions with imams and the general public. We have also been to every household in some of the sensitive neighbourhoods in our respective jurisdictions to ensure peace is maintained. We have identified some of the trouble-prone areas and set up CCTV cameras so that the people know they are being watched and can be thwarted from creating a ruckus,” said a senior officer of central division.

Cops said they have earmarked some areas, like Chhatubabu, Bibibagan, Motijhil, Matipara and Pilkhana, where there were riots in 1992 and other occasions in the past. “Round-the-clock police posting and multiple route marches have been initiated in these areas to keep the situation under control,” said the officer.

“We have been conducting beat meetings with people in our neighbourhood for the past two days. The meetings have been fruitful so far. We have explained to them the current situation in the country and have sought their help to prevent any law-and-order deterioration here,” said an officer of the south-east division of Kolkata Police.

Bidhannagar City Police commissioner Laxmi Narayan Meena said he, too, has instructed officers of all police stations in Bidhannagar to be alert and conduct peace meetings in their respective areas to prevent any unforeseen event. “We have asked officers of all ranks to stay alert and act according to the situation. So far, the situation has been under control,” he said.

PATNA: All the 1,597 retail outlets of the Indian Oil Corporation Limited (IOCL) across the state will begin supplying Bharat Stage-VI (BS-VI) grade fuels from April 1.

Addressing mediapersons here on Thursday, IOCL Bihar head and executive director Vibhash Kumar said, “The new version will be launched across the country on April 1. Bihar will also be part of the shift from BS-IV to BS-VI grade fuels.”

On October 24 last year, the Supreme Court had ruled that no BS-IV vehicle would be sold across the country from April 1, 2020. Accordingly, the state government imposed a ban on the use of BS-IV vehicles after March 31.

Talking about the merits of conversion, Vibhash said, “The sulphur content will be reduced from the present 50 parts per million (PPM) in BS-IV grade fuels to 10 PPM in BS-VI. This will mitigate the problem of pollution and improve the air quality to a large extent.”

He added, “Besides, the gap between emission limits for petrol and diesel cars will narrow down substantially.”

Vibhash pointed out that the planned expenditure for transition to BS-VI was around Rs 17,000 crore, including a Rs 1,772 crore expenditure on the Barauni refinery.

Deliberating on IOCL’s plan in Bihar, Vibhash said, “To meet the demand of petrol and diesel, we are upgrading the capacity of Barauni refinery from 6 million metric tonne to 9 million metric tonne by utilising funds to the tune of Rs 1,400 crore. The deadline of the project is June, 2024. Work is also underway on several other projects of the IOCL in Bihar, which entail an estimated outlay of Rs 22,000 crore.”

He also stressed on building sustainable energy infrastructure that could cater to the energy needs of all people.

CGM (operations) R K Singh, general manager (retail sales of Bihar state office) Ajay Garg and chief manager (planning and coordination) Veena Kumari were also present on the occasion.

Nashik: A 30-year-old jawan in the Indian Army strangled his wife at his residence in Indrapastha Nagari, in the Mhasrul area of the city, on Wednesday night.

Jawan Sunil Bava was arrested and produced before a local court on Thursday, which remanded him in police custody for two days.

Pandharinath Dhokane, the senior inspector at the Mhasrul police station, said after killing his wife Chaitali, Bawa slit his wrist with a blade purportedly to end his own life. “The injury was not serious. He was arrested soon after he was released from the hospital,” said Dhokane.

Preliminary investigation has revealed that the couple did not share a healthy relationship since they got married two years ago. They also have a two-and-a-half years-old daughter.

Bawa was posted in Jammu and Kashmir and had come home on a 10-day leave.

Police officers said that before killing his wife, the jawan had called up his cousin, who stays in Kalyan, to vent his frustration about his wife.

“His cousin got suspicious and immediately called up Chaitali’s father, who stays in Nashik. Her father rushed to the couple’s residence and found her lying on the bed. Bawa was bleeding profusely from the wrist,” said police.

The victim’s father immediately contacted the local police, who deployed a team tp Bawa’s residence. Chaitali’s body has been sent for post-mortem.

Mumbai: Fevicol maker Pidilite Industries has entered into an agreement with Tenax of Italy to acquire 70% in its Indian subsidiary Tenax India Stone Products. The acquisition is being made for a cash consideration of around Rs 80 crore. The move would help the homegrown sealants and adhesives player expand its presence in the market.

Tenax India was set up in 2005 as a subsidiary of Tenax Italy, a manufacturer of adhesives, coating, surface treatment chemicals and abrasives of marble, granite and stone. It is engaged in the sales and distribution of Tenax Italy products in the Indian retail market.

After the acquisition, Tenax India will become a subsidiary of Pidilite, enabling Tenax India to leverage the sales, distribution and marketing capability of Pidilite in India and Saarc markets. However, Tenax Italy will continue to be a partner with a 30% stake in the Indian arm.

Pidilite Industries MD Bharat Puri said, “This acquisition will help expand Pidilite’s presence in the fast-growing adhesives, coatings and surface treatment chemicals market for the marble and stone Industry and bring world-class technology to India by investing in a manufacturing plant.”

Chennai: Combined effect of parts shortage caused sue to Corona virus outbreak in China coupled with increased import duties of 12.5% from 10% on compressors, imposed in the union budget, airconditioner makers have marked up prices by nearly 5% or around Rs 2,000 a unit. Bluestar, which effected a price increase earlier this month said that with the sea routes to and from China being blocked , some of the components have to be airlifted, thereby adding to the costs. “The ocean freight charges are up by 65%-100% and the increase in custom duty would bring up the cost by roughly upto Rs 200 per air conditioner on an average,” said B Thiagarajan, MD, Blue Star. Indian consumer durable brands are dependent on China for components and compressors. Dependency on imports from China even for brands which make compressors in-house has had a negative impact on the consumer durables sector. “A price increase of up to 3% for consumer durables such as televisions sets, ACs, refrigerators and microwaves, is anticipated from March 2020 onwards, mainly contributed to the short supply of components and finished goods due to coronavirus outbreak, apart from the duty increase on certain components like compressors and motors and in some cases on finished goods,” said Kamal Nandi, business head and EVP, Godrej Appliances.

Eric Braganza, president, Haier India says, “Haier is looking at increasing the prices of air conditioners by 3%-5% due to the hike in customs duty and logistics cost amidst coronavirus outbreak We have already increased the prices of our deep freezers and will shortly be increasing prices in TV and refrigerator categories as well. Besides an increase in prices, companies also predict a supply shortage in April with the current conditions in China. With the expectations of a good summer, brands expect a shortage in stocks in the peak seasons. Blue Star’s Thiagarajan said that they have stocked up enough for the units to last until the mid of April, he expects the latter half to see some shortage if summers end up being hotter.

59,['28/02/2020'],Truck &amp; bus financiers cut down financing BS4 chassis,"This story is from February 28, 2020

Chennai: With the March 31 deadline for registration of BS4 vehicles just a month away, most truck financiers, including Sundaram Finance, Cholamandalam and HDFC Bank have stopped financing the purchase of BS4 truck and bus chassis, as these vehicles will a body-built at workshops after which they will need to pass a fresh RTO fitness test before getting their final registration. Typically, a body building workshop takes between 30-45 days to build a cowl/bus body/cabin on a chassis. For tourist buses, that takes longer. So a BS4 chassis bought now will not be ready for registration before the March 31 cut off date, say financiers. “For the last 2 or 3 weeks we are going slow on financing BS4 chassis. Unless we are absolutely sure that body building will happen before the deadline, we are not financing the vehicle. In a situation like this, the risk to the financier is significant and we have been very careful. We are identifying only those vehicles where there is certainty that body building will be complete before March 31,” said Sundaram Finance CFO M Ramaswamy. Others like Cholamandalam Finance have completely stopped chassis financing from this week onwards. “We have stopped financing chassis. And it is not just us — most financiers have stopped financing BS4 chassis. For us, February 25 was the cut-off for financing BS4 chassis. BS6 chassis are not yet available. We are only making an exception for one or two customers on a case to case basis if we are confident that the body is readily available,” said Ravindra Kundu, executive director, Cholamandalam Investment & Finance.

Financiers say the cut-back is only on account of the risk involved in financing a truck or bus chassis. “Yes banks are careful on vehicles where body building is required because uncertainty about completion and final registration is creating anxiety but there should be no issue with fully-built vehicles,” said Umesh Revankar, MD & CEO, Shriram Transport Finance. As for unsold BS4 stock, ultimately, say financiers, the buck stops with the truck and bus companies. “Those who produced the BS4 vehicles until now should take the risk. Why have banks to be blamed for not financing? There is no desperation to take such risks. Were the OEMs hoping that the (March 31 vehicle registration) deadline would get extended?,” said Ashok Khanna, group head-vehicle loans, HDFC Bank. (ENDS)

On Thursday, Sangareddy SP Chandana Deepthi also tweeted about the suspension. “The Police Officer, N Sridhar, PC-349 who is seen kicking the father of the deceased in the Patancheru incident of 26.02.2020, is placed under suspension,” he wrote.

In the evening, DGP Reddy held a video conference with all police officers and home guards in the state, excluding traffic police, to discuss the incident. During the three hour long video conference, DGP advised his colleagues to be careful about their conduct as irresponsible behaviour by a few officials would tarnish the image of the entire department.

DGP advised that at each police station, a focus group comprising of youth, farmers, factory workers, senior citizens, teachers, women and students should be formed. After brainstorming with them, a course of action should be prepared to prevent such incidents from recurring.

After the suicide of 16-year-old student Sandhya at her college hostel in Patancheru on Tuesday, police shifted her body to Patancheru government hospital. Students barged into the mortuary and brought the freezer containing the body to the road to stage a protest. While police were trying to take the body back into the mortuary, Sandhya’s father resisted. Constable Sridhar kicked and forcibly removed him.

61,['28/02/2020'],VNGU VC’s speech creates ripples on social media,"This story is from February 28, 2020

SURAT: The convocation speech by Shivendra Gupta , vice-chancellor of Veer Narmad South Gujarat University (VNSGU), has sent ripples across the social media in the Diamond City.

The statement made in the presence of thousands of students has put the government in a tight spot. In his speech delivered at the 51st convocation on Wednesday, Gupta had said: “The rate of unemployment is currently at its highest possible level.”

Gupta started his little over 10 minutes address, saying, “Presidential address and convocation address are not so interesting things. But I have to perform these duties because without it the convocation remains incomplete.” Gupta was presiding over the convocation function where Kapil Dave, former Indian cricket team captain, and poet Rajesh Reddy were guests.

In his address Gupta said, “The first and foremost is the issue of unemployment. The rate of unemployment is probably at the highest possible level. It has increasingly became evident that universities are somehow not supplying the trained workforce demanded by industries.”

A video grab of Gupta’s speech is being circulated widely on various social media platforms. The video has only that portion in which Gupta is heard speaking about unemployment.

When questioned about his statement, Gupta said, “I was speaking in the context of the students of VNSGU and not about the overall situation. I suggested to bridge the gap between the university and industries.”

“Vice chancellor is the top official of the university and he gets feedback from the society and sources. He must have received information reflecting the current situation on unemployment and he expressed it in his convocation address,” said Sanjay Desai, a syndicate member.

A short-circuit in the electricity meter box at Aceto Chem Private Limited caused an explosion

SURAT: Two persons were killed and two others received serious injuries in a huge explosion at a chemical factory at Pandesara GIDC on Thursday.

Surat Municipal Corporation’s (SMC) fire and emergency services department officials said the explosion took place due to a short-circuit in the electricity meter box at Aceto Chem Private Limited, a chemical company owned by Bansi Patel, at Pandesara GIDC at about 11:30am. Fire officials stated that a portion of the three-storey chemical company collapsed after the blast. It took three hours for the firefighters to extinguish the fire.

About 50 workers were present in the factory when the fire took place but majority of them managed to escape. The explosion was heard in a five kilometre radius of the GIDC estate. However, Pappu Singh, 28, and Amod Singh, 35, both residents of Pandesara, were killed. Raju Paswan, 40, with serious burns injuries was admitted to a private hospital and Amar Singh Nisar, 35, to New Civil Hospital after he fractured both his legs while trying to jump from the first floor of the chemical company.

Vidhi Chaudhary, deputy commissioner of police (zone-3), told TOI, “The chemical substance coming out of the factory was highly acidic. There was a burning sensation in my legs when I accidentally stepped into a pool of chemical. Two workers were killed in the fire. We have sought a report from Forensic Science Laboratory (FSL) to know the exact reason behind the fire. We will decide on the course of action against the owner of the chemical factory after receiving the report.”

Fire officer Dipak Makhajani told TOI, “The company owned by Bansi Patel manufactures coloured dyes and chemicals for processing of finished fabrics in textile mills. There was a burning sensation in the eyes of people due to the hazardous nature of the chemical. Firefighters faced lot of difficulties in dousing the fire. The explosion could have occurred due to a short-circuit in electricity cables.”

Representative image

SURAT: Surat Municipal Corporation (SMC) will get subsidy to purchase 150 electric buses in the phased manner during the next one year, for which it has already received Rs 13.5 crore as the first installment from the union government.

According to SMC officials, these buses have been sanctioned under Phase-II of Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of Electric Vehicles in India Scheme (FAME India Scheme) of Department of Heavy Industry (Ministry of Heavy Industries and Public Enterprises ).

With this, the civic body officials expect to run around 75 electric buses on Bus Rapid Transportation System (BRTS) routes in the city from Diwali onwards. This will be a major boost to Surat’s effort for clean mobility in public transportation system.

“Under the Union government’s scheme, Surat is entitled to get a total subsidy of Rs 67.5 crore for 150 electric buses. Of this, 20 percent subsidy (Rs 13.5 crore) has been released now. The electric buses will help reduce carbon emission and fight pollution as well,” said an SMC official.

According to officials, in order to give a further push to clean mobility, the Department of Heavy Industry has approved 150 electric buses to Surat under FAME India scheme phase II.

Department of Heavy Industry had invited the Expression of Interest (EoI) from more than million cities, smart cities, States and Union territories capitals and cities from special category states for submission of proposal for deployment of Electric Buses on operational cost basis. Surat had also submitted its proposal for the same.

Government expects that these buses will run about 4 billion kilometer during their contract period and are expected to save cumulatively about 1.2 billion litre fuel over the contract period. This will result in cutting 2.6 million tonnes of CO2 emission.

“Surat has 102km BRTS corridor, the largest dedicated corridor in the country and 1.35 lakh commuters travel daily on BRTS buses. Apart from BRTS, on average, 1.4 lakh commuters travel on city buses daily,” said an official.

64,['28/02/2020'],SMC to set up 27 new vending zones for street vendors,"This story is from February 28, 2020

SURAT: There is a good news for street vendors and citizens as Surat Municipal Corporation ( SMC ) will set up 27 new vegetable vending zones in different parts of the city in the coming months.

This will help street vendors get dedicated spaces with civic amenities, while citizens will get vegetable zones near their localities.

The new vending zones will come up in Rander , Limbayat, Althan, Katargam and Athwa zones of the SMC .

According to the SMC officials, at present, there are over 52 existing vending zones in the city, but in many areas, new vending zones are needed to support street vendors. In the absence of any dedicated space for vending, vegetable vendors are left with no option but to be on the streets for vending, causing traffic snarls in the city. The civic body plans to set up 27 new vending zones in different parts of the city with the cost of Rs 76 crore.

The new vending zones will accommodate 3,339 vendors in the city. These vending zones will be built under the central government’s National Urban Livelihoods Mission (NULM)’s Support to Urban Street Vendors (SUSV) programme.

“We will receive grants from the central government for these vending zones. We have named this project as ‘Ajivika’ (employment),’’ SMC commissioner Banchhanidhi Pani told TOI.

“The new vending zones will have CC Road, drainage system, water supply system, storm water drainage, public conveniences, recharge borewell and parking space. Moreover, they will have fire extinguishers, solar panels, organic waste converters and CCTVs,’’ Pani said.

Apart from creating new vending zones, the SMC will also renovate existing vending zones in old parts of the city. These vending zones are located in the central zone area which include Bhagal, Saiyadpara and Navsari Bazaar. According to an estimate, there are over 22,000 street vendors in the city.

“The NULM seeks to address the concerns of urban street vendors by facilitating access to suitable spaces for vending, institutional credit, improved skills and social security linkages,’’ said an official.

“Street vendors constitute an important segment at the bottom of the pyramid of the informal economy in cities. Street vending provides a source of self-employment, and acts as a measure of urban poverty alleviation. Street vending also has a prominent place in the urban supply chain, and provides inexpensive and convenient access to goods and services to all segments of the population including the poor,’’ Pani said.

Bihar deputy CM Sushil Kumar Modi

PATNA: Deputy CM Sushil Kumar Modi on Thursday said work on revision of pension of 2.53 lakh employees, who had retired before 2016, as per recommendations of the Seventh Pay Commission would be completed by March 31.

“Pension revision of about 2.20 lakh retired employees has already been done,” Modi said in response to a question raised by RJD leader Ram Chandra Purbey in the legislative council on Thursday.

Modi, who also holds the finance portfolio, said the task of revision of pension of retired employees before January 2016 was earlier given to the banks. “The banks, however, did not show interest in the work. Later, the pension revision work was given to the accountant general office. However, the work was delayed due to shortage of data entry operators,” he said.

The deputy CM added, “The state government has engaged eight data entry operators for this work. The revision of retired employees’ pension will be done by March 31.”

Replying to a question of RJD MLC Radhacharan Sah about loan to self-help groups (SHGs) in Bihar , Modi said all the SHGs under Jeevika would now get loan at 7% interest. “This system is already applicable in 17 districts of the state. It will now be applicable in other 21 districts, where SHGs currently get loan at 10-12 % interest,” the deputy CM said.

Replying to a question raised by BJP MLC Nawal Kishor Yadav on ‘rise in crime’ in Patna, energy minister Bijendra Prasad Yadav replied on behalf of the home department that six people were arrested and pistols and cartridges seized from them by the Patna police in two separate cases of loot in the district. “One criminal was arrested for holding employees of a petrol pump hostage at gunpoint and looting Rs 50,000 from them at Digha on January 4,” Yadav said.

He added, “Five people were arrested in connection with the loot at a gas agency in Naubatpur. The criminals had looted Rs 2.5 lakh from the gas agency on January 5.”

66,['28/02/2020'],NRC and CAA anti-poor: Tejashwi Prasad Yadav,"This story is from February 28, 2020

Tejashwi Prasad Yadav

GAYA: Incarcerated RJD chief Lalu Prasad’s younger son and leader of opposition Tejashwi Prasad Yadav on Thursday said that Bihar has become the ‘epicentre of unemployment’. He said that no less than 7 crore Bihari youths have no work and largescale migration of work force was taking place.

Addressing a public meeting at Sherghati, the younger Yadav scion said that CAA, NPR and NRC were just diversionary tactics to deflect attention from real issues, like unemployment and hyperinflation. He also blamed Bihar CM Nitish Kumar for strengthening the divisive forces in the country that culminated in communal riots in Delhi.

Tejashwi, who was in Sherghati as part of his ongoing ‘Berozgari Hatao Yatra’ alleged that the CAA was a sham aimed at causing religious divide. He also said that NRC was inherently anti-poor as the daily wagers living in slums, crores of homeless and people living in areas vulnerable to natural disasters like floods are the undocumented population of the country. “It is an invitation to chaos,” he said.

The RJD leader promised to fill all vacant positions in the state government and other bodies if his party came to power in the forthcoming assembly elections. Former speaker Uday Narain Chaudhary created ripples at the public meet by saying that political rumour mills were agog with speculation about 2015 type re-alignment of political forces in the state and return of CM Nitish Kumar to the Mahagatbandhan fold.

“If any such alliance was to take place, Tejashwi and not Nitish should be the CM face,” said Chaudhary.

The political realignment issue was also raised by RJD strongman and former minister Surindra Prasad Yadav. Accusing the Bihar CM of betrayal, the former minister who represents the Belaganj seat in the Bihar assembly, said that going by the CM’s track record and ‘politics of opportunism’ practised by him, any tie up with Nitish would be ‘politically counter-productive’.

“Mahagatbandhan in its present form is very strong,” Tejashwi said.

While both Surindra and Chaudhary spoke before Tejashwi, the former deputy CM did not make any response to the realignment story. Instead Tejashwi quoted statistics to claim that his party left a much stronger economy as compared to one that the party inherited. He also claimed that without increasing fare, Lalu pulled out Indian railways from ‘deep red’ and made it financially obese.

“The NDA government is now selling railway assets at throw away prices,” Tejashwi said.

67,['28/02/2020'],CM Nitish Kumar should stop NPR exercise in Bihar: Former JNUSU president Kanhaiya Kumar,"This story is from February 28, 2020

Former JNUSU president Kanhaiya Kumar

PATNA: CPI functionary and former JNU Students’ Union president Kanhaiya Kumar on Thursday said chief minister Nitish Kumar should issue a gazette notification to stop National Population Register (NPR) exercise in the state.

Kanhaiya, who was addressing his ‘Samvidhan Bachao Nagrikta Bachao Maharally’ at Gandhi Madian here, asked people to exert pressure on their local representatives so that resolutions could be passed at the panchayat level against the NPR.

“If the government issues a notification that there will be no NPR, it’s fine. Otherwise, tell your mukhiyas to pass a resolution at panchayat level against the NPR. The resolution should then be sent to the DM concerned,” Kanhaiya said. He asked the people to be ready for “civil disobedience movement” in worst case.

Stressing on the need to maintain communal harmony, the CPI leader said fire knew no religion or caste. “Britishers used to follow divide-and-rule policy. They used to throw pork in mosques and cow meat in temples. Because of that hatred, our country was divided. In Delhi, it was not a Hindu or a Muslim who lost his life, it was humanity which died,” Kanhiaya said.

Kanhaiya said the controversy over citizenship rights was designed to divert the attention of people from issues like unemployment, education and health. Raising ‘azadi’ slogan, he said country’s independence was once again in danger. “We want independence from poverty, unemployment and dishonesty,” he added.

Congress’s Kadwa MLA Shakil Ahmad Khan hit out at the BJP government for asking common people to prove their patriotism now and then. He said, “Those who were licking the boots of Britishers during independence and did not support Quit India movement are asking us to provide certificate of nationalism. Our history has the answer. You don’t even feel the pain of people being killed.”

Mahatma Gandhi’s great grandson Tushar Gandhi said Bapu had asked people to maintain communal harmony and he had started his fight for independence from Bihar. “This is the second fight for independence,” Tushar said.

Former IAS officer Kannan Gopinathan said people were discussing about number of Hindus or Muslims being affected by NRC in Assam, ignoring the plight of women. “Names of around 12 lakh Hindus, six lakh Muslims and one lakh dalits were not there on NRC list in Assam. Of them, 70% were women,” Gopinathan said.

Others who addressed the rally were social activists Medha Patekar, Shabnam Hashmi and Sadaf Zafar, Congress MLA Awadhesh Singh, CPI(ML) MLA Mehboob Alam, representatives from RLSP, HAM (S) and student leaders from Jamia, JNU and Patna University. However, none from RJD addressed the rally.

68,['28/02/2020'],Dirty tricks operation aimed at top SoftBank executives: Report,"This story is from February 28, 2020

SoftBank executive Rajeev Misra (File photo)

BENGALURU: Top SoftBank executive Rajeev Misra had launched a smear campaign against two other high ranking executives of Indian origin — Nikesh Arora and Alok Sama — at the Japanese telecom and investment giant, according to a report from The Wall Street Journal. The tactics included a shareholder campaign to get them removed, planting of negative news stories on them, and even a honeytrap to blackmail, said the report.

The developments come at a time when SoftBank’s Vision Fund has suffered setbacks on a number of its investments, like WeWork, and activist firm Elliott Management has become a shareholder in the firm. A former Deutsche Bank executive, Misra joined SoftBank in 2014 and is right now the CEO of the $100-billion Vision Fund, besides also being on the board of the company.

Arora had resigned as president and heir apparent at SoftBank in 2016 after an internal investigation found the charges against him to be false. A former top Google executive, Arora had cited differences in the timeline of succession with SoftBank founder Masayoshi Son as the reason for his departure.

Sama, who came in as Arora’ s deputy and helped the SoftBank founder steer his biggest deals — like the $32-billion purchase of UK’s ARM Holdings, and $59-billion merger of US telcos Sprint and T-Mobile — left in April last year, as TOI had reported.

“These are old allegations which contain a series of falsehoods that have been consistently denied,” a spokesman for Misra said. “Mr. Misra did not orchestrate a campaign against his former colleagues.” A SoftBank spokesperson said, “For several years, we have investigated a campaign of falsehoods against SoftBank Group and certain former employees in an attempt to identify those behind it. SoftBank will be reviewing the inferences made by The Wall Street Journal.”

The WSJ report said Misra joined hands with an Italian businessman Alessandro Benedetti, who previously worked with private intelligence operatives and computer hackers, and also made a payment of $500,000 to him for targeting Arora and Sama. Benedetti’s effort to honey-trap Arora with one or multiple women did not succeed in Tokyo, the report added.

CPI-ML legislators demonstrate on assembly premises on Thursday

PATNA: With opposition members targeting agriculture minister Prem Kumar and creating noisy scenes in the assembly on Thursday, leading to its adjournment twice, Speaker Vijay Kumar Choudhary asked the ministers to “confine” themselves to only giving replies to the questions and supplementary queries of the members.

The Speaker first adjourned the House for 35 minutes at 11.25 am when the RJD, Congress and CPI(ML) members entered the well of the House, claiming that the agriculture minister had not given satisfactory answer to the short-notice question of RJD member Lalit Kumar Yadav regarding the farmers who could not get diesel subsidy for various reasons.

The Speaker again adjourned the House after it passed the resolution on caste-based census following unruly scenes over the same issue of payment of diesel subsidy to the farmers.

The tricky situation occurred when the agriculture minister was giving replies to Lalit’s short-notice question and supplementary queries. The latter wanted to know if the slightly over 5.07 lakh farmers, who had also applied for diesel subsidy online but had been deprived of it, would ever get it, and also if the farmers who could not apply for it online would be considered for the payment of subsidy.

The minister said 11.44 lakh farmers had submitted online application for diesel subsidy. Of them, 6.37 lakh farmers were paid Rs 83.25 crore as per the revised rules after proper verification.

“Today, there is 24-hour supply of electricity and all payments to the beneficiaries are made through the direct benefit transfer method. Everything is done as per rules,” the minister said. He told the Speaker that the opposition members were criticising him because he is from extremely backward caste.

The Speaker adjourned the House, as the opposition members, who had entered the well of the House, refused to return to their seats.

After the House met again and passed the resolution regarding caste-based census, Lalit stood up and demanded an apology from Prem for making reference to the “lantern age” and for claiming that he was being victimized on account of being an EBC man. At this, the Speaker issued a general advisory to all the ministers that they should not stray from the answers required for a question.

KOLKATA: The state’s first health clinic exclusively for the transgender community was inaugurated on Thursday. Aimed at providing basic healthcare to the community that often faces harassment while seeking medical care, the clinic, titled Antar, will be in operation twice a week for now and the consultation will be free.

“As a teen, I had gone to a local doctor as I was suffering from dysentery. To my utter shock, the doctor wanted to see my genitals to confirm whether I was male or female,” said Tista Das, a transgender activist.

A joint initiative with Prantakatha and Association of Transgender and Hijra in Bengal (ATHB), the clinic was inaugurated by minister of women and child and social welfare Shashi Panja at Peerless Hospital . Initially, the clinic will have general physicians, though the hospital has plans to invite endocrinologists to be part of the project. “Apart from basic health issues, a good number of transgender people are on hormone therapy, which comes with a number of side effects. Hence, they need regular monitoring,” said Peerless MD Sujit Kar Purkayastha.

Apart from Bappaditya Mukherjee of Prantakatha and Ranjita Sinha of ATHB, American Center director Monica Shie was present on Thursday.

“We have been holding sensitizing workshops in the hospital before launching this project,” said Subrojyoti Bhowmick, clinical director of the hospital who is in charge of Antar.

Other private hospitals in the city said they do not discriminate against people from the community and added they had no plans of setting up such exclusive clinics.

“We have been attending to patients from the transgender community just like we take care of any other patient,” said an official at Apollo Hospitals.

“We do not have plans for an exclusive clinic. But whenever a patient from the LGBTQ community comes in, we allow them to choose their gender while filling up the form,” said a source at Fortis Hospital.

We have given them time till March 15 to have a dialogue with the employee federations and fulfill our demands,” said Tej Singh Rathore, general secretary, All Rajasthan State Government Employees’ Federation.

“On March 15, there is a joint meeting of the executive boards of all the employee federations. If the government doesn’t talk to us, we will launch a state-wide agitation. We also demand that the DA should be detached from the budget announcement and should be implemented immediately. The state government employees should enjoy benefits of DA at the same time when central government employees get it, which is in the month of July and January. As per the budget, DA will be implemented in April, which is pending since last July. For this year’s DA, should we wait till the next budget. Therefore, the DA should be paid immediately,” he added.

They held demonstrations outside district collectorates over salary cut, delay in payment of salaries, delay in filling vacant posts in various departments, bringing back the old pension scheme, to make contractual employees permanent and against downsizing of government departments.

“In 2013, the Gehlot government had revised the payscale of the employees. The last BJP government withdrew this move and reduced the payscale. The salary structure of a few departments - like roadways, RTDC - have not been revised as per 7th Pay Commission. This is also one of our demands,” he said.

The All Rajasthan State Government Employees Federation (United) had demanded merging of grade pay 5, 6, 7 as one level and 8, 9 as one (as per the central government norms). They also demanded implementation of the Samant committee report.

74,['28/02/2020'],Firms offload old models as BS-VI deadline nears,"This story is from February 28, 2020

PATNA: Automobile dealers and showrooms in the city are offering lucrative discounts on Bharat Stage-IV (BS- IV) cars and two-wheelers to clear the existing stock of such vehicles. With the new BS-VI norms coming into effect from April 1, people will not be able to register BS-IV vehicles any more.

According to experts, the sulphur content of BS-VI fuel is five times lower than that in BS-IV. Besides, BS-VI compliant vehicles can lead to a substantial reduction of nitrogen oxide emissions.

The general manager of an automobile showroom on Ashiana-Digha Road, S K Singh, told this newspaper, “We are only following the government norms and offering rebates, ranging from Rs 35,000 to Rs 2 lakh on various BS-IV car models. We do not have many vehicles in stock, but are trying to sell off everything before April 1.”

Some dealers claimed that owners of petrol-run vehicles did not have much to worry about due to the new norms. “There is a slight difference between BS-IV and BS-IV when it comes to petrol-run vehicles. In diesel-based old models of BS-IV vehicles, the sulphur emission is five times higher than BS-VI vehicles,” said Abhimanyu, the sales executive of an automobile showroom on Exhibition Road.

Similarly, dealers of two-wheelers, including motorbikes and scooters, are giving lucrative offers to end the old stocks of BS-IV models. “We are giving a flat discount of Rs 3,500 as well as an exchange offer. We are also offering minimum down payment offers to new customers,” said Saurav Suman, the sales executive at a two-wheeler showroom in New Dak Bungalow area.

Few dealers claimed that a large number of people were buying BS-IV vehicles. Aman Kumar, the customer relationship manager of a two-wheeler showroom pointed out, “More than 80% of our customers have bought BS-IV models in the last few days as they are cheaper and more user-friendly. The BS-VI models, on the contrary, have several new and complicated features.”

Meanwhile, customers are happy with the discounts being offered to them. “We do not get such discounts even during Dhanteras sale. I have booked a car worth Rs 10 lakh by paying just Rs 8 lakh,” said Ashok Sinha, a resident of Patliputra Colony.

76,['28/02/2020'],State to demand hike in coal royalty,"This story is from February 28, 2020

Bhubaneswar: Revision of coal royalty, Left-wing extremism and pending railway projects are some of the key issues that are likely to be discussed in the Eastern Zonal Council meeting to be chaired by Union home minister Amit Shah here on Friday, government sources said.

While West Bengal chief minister Mamata Benerjee is already in Bhubaneswar to attend the programme, her Bihar counterpart Nitish Kumar is scheduled to arrive here on Friday morning.

Mamata, one of the fiercest critics of the Citizenship Amendment Act and who has resorted to social media to protest against the violence in Delhi over CAA, will come face-to-face with Shah for the first time after the Act was enacted.

Similarly, Nitish will meet the Union home minister in the wake of his government passing a resolution against the National Register of Citizens (NRC) and in favour of the 2010 format of the National Population Register, something the BJP may not have liked.

Sources said Jharkhand CM Hemant Soren will not attend the meeting. The Jharkhand Congress state unit chief and finance minister Rameshwar Oraon will represent him, it is reliably learnt.

Since all four member states of the council — Bihar, Odisha, West Bengal and Jharkahand — are coal-bearing states, the issue of non-revision of coal royalty for around eight years may figure prominently in discussions.

Odisha chief secretary Asit Tripathy said the state will raise the long-pending demand of hike in coal royalty and lack of mobile connectivity in 11,000 villages.

The Naveen Patnaik-led government has been demanding a periodic revision of coal royalty every three years, according to the norms. The royalty has not been revised since 2012. As per an estimate, owing to the non-revision of royalty, the coal-bearing state has lost more than Rs 10,000 crore. The government has also been pressing for Centre’s assistance to ensure mobile connectivity to villages without one.

Sources said the meeting is also scheduled to see a discussion on interstate water issues, power transmission lines, pending land and forest clearance of railway projects, investigation of heinous offences, cattle smuggling across the country’s borders, lack of banking infrastructure in remote areas, petroleum projects, sharing pattern of centrally collected revenues, among others.

Naveen is the vice-chairman and host of the conference

The chief ministers will be accompanied by two cabinet ministers from their respective states besides the chief secretaries and other senior officers.

The Eastern Zonal Council had last met in Kolkata on October 1, 2018.

The Centre had set up five zonal councils in 1957 under Sections 15-22 of the States Reorganization Act, 1956. The Union home minister is the chairman of all the five councils. The chief minister of the host state, chosen by rotation every year, is the vice-chairman.

As per the agenda, Naveen will make the welcome address followed by introductory remarks by the finance minister of Jharkahand and the CMs of West Bengal and Bihar. Shah will make the opening remarks, which will be followed by agenda-wise discussion. The home minister will also make the closing remarks at the end of the daylong programme.

77,['28/02/2020'],‘Baat Bihar Ki’: Prashant Kishor accused of plagiarism,"This story is from February 28, 2020

Prashant Kishor

PATNA: A complaint case was filed in a local court against poll strategist Prashant Kishor on Thursday a day after an FIR was lodged against him with the Patliputra police station here for alleged breach of trust and fraud. Kishor was expelled from JD(U) on January 29 following his differences with party’s top leadership over CAA, proposed NRC and NPR in the state.

On Thursday, a complaint case was filed against Kishor in the court of the chief judicial magistrate (CJM) in Patna for allegedly stealing slogan, logo and data, which the complainant, Shashwat Gautam, a political data analyst, had allegedly conceptualized for the state assembly polls scheduled to be held later this year.

The complaint case was transferred to the court of incharge sub-judicial magistrate-8 Abhishek Ranjan for further proceedings. When contacted, Gautam’s legal counsel Sangeet Devkuliar said, “We have filed a suit for damages under civil criminal procedure code and Intellectual Property Act since Gautam’s IPR has been stolen.”

Besides Kishor, the name of Osama Khursheed figured in the complaint filed in the court. Khursheed had earlier contested the Patna University Students’ Union election for the post of joint secretary when Kishor was monitoring the election campaign for Chhatra JD(U), sources said.

The complaint alleged that Gautam had to incur a loss of Rs.10 crore due to theft of data and other election related contents. “We have sufficient evidences to prove the charges levelled against the accused,” Gautam's legal counsel said.

The complaint filed on behalf of Gautam, a resident of Motihari in East Champaran district, said he (Gautam) had helped Kishor in conceptualizing the election campaign of JD(U) during the 2015 state assembly poll. Gautam, who had studied data analytics at George Washington University, USA, had earlier collected data with Kishor during the previous assembly polls, when JD(U) was part of the alliance with the RJD and the Congress and had performed very well in the election.

Earlier, an FIR was lodged against Kishor and Khursheed with the Patliputra police station under sections 467 (forgery of valuable security), 468 (forgery for purpose of cheating), 471 (using as genuine of a forged document), 420 (cheating and dishonesty inducing delivery of property) 406 (breach of trust) and 120B ( conspiracy) of IPC on Wednesday night.

According to the Gautam's complaint, Osama was working with him on ‘Bihar Ki Baat’ project before he resigned from job. It further claimed that the organization had got the programme registered in January for its use in future. However, the data was stolen and used by someone else.

Patna high court advocate Devkuliar said, “The case filed by Gautam is very clear since somebody’s property has been stolen and used by someone else with little changes.”

On January 20, Kishor launched his ‘ Baat Bihar Ki ’ campaign with an aim to connect 10 lakh youths in the state. The programme received wide applause with around 3 lakh people willing to be associated with it on the very first day. Despite repeated attempts, Kishor couldn’t be reached for his comments. A staff of Kishor’s I-PAC said, “I am not authorized to talk to the media. Kindly contact him (Kishor) for any comment on such issues.”

Meanwhile, Khursheed, who has been accused of stealing campaign slogan and data from Gautam, denied all the allegations against him. Khursheed, however, accepted that he knew Gautam. “I am a student leader and many people come to meet me. Gautam had also approached me through a friend of mine, especially after my candidate’s performance in Patna University election. However, I have never worked with him,” he added.

Khursheed said ‘biharkibaat.in’ was registered by Sashwat in January 2020, while ‘BIHARKIBAAT.COM’ was created by someone in April 2019. “There are seven different Facebook pages with this name and almost similar logo. He (Shashwat) should clarify which data he is talking about. This is his publicity stunt,” Khursheed said.

78,['28/02/2020'],AAI circular allows reverification of site coordinates of buildings with NOC,"This story is from February 28, 2020

SURAT: Airports Authority of India (AAI) has issued aerodrome safeguarding circular (ADSAC) to check violation of height norms by buildings in the vicinity of airports, including Surat.

Surat airport has been listed among 21 airports across the country where ADSAC will allow reverification of site coordinates of buildings for which no-objection certificate (NOC) has been issued.

Till now, there was a standard procedure for builders to apply under no-objection certificate application system (NOCAS) for taking NOC for building construction. Once NOC was approved under NOCAS, the same was submitted to Surat Municipal Corporation SMC) for approval of building construction.

Official sources said AAI has made a provision for appointment of Geographical Information System (GIS) analysts at airports for aeronautical surveys, aeronautical data management, quality control of surveyed data, image processing etc.

Once NOC for a building is approved, local airport authorities will have to reverify site coordinates and building height obstacles with GIS analyst by visiting the locations and later need to submit a report to higher authorities on a quarterly basis. In case of continued non-compliance by a developer, cancellation of NOC by the designated officer could be taken up on request of local airport authorities.

Surat airport has been facing building height obstruction issue for a long time. AAI has identified about 90 buildings of 17 projects that obstruct flight path of airport runway and that notices have been served to concerned builders.

Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) had displaced runway by 615 metres, out of the total 2,905 metres for safe landing of aircraft at the airport due to height obstacles.

An AAI officer said, “The building height violation is hampering development of Surat airport. In order to protect the airport from further damage, AAI has come up with this circular where local airport authorities have been designated the power to request cancellation of NOC for non-compliance by developers. As Surat still has a vast land near airport open for real estate development, building height violations will be closely looked at.”

79,['28/02/2020'],"‘Normal summer in south Bengal, harsher in north’","This story is from February 28, 2020

The minimum temperature in Kolkata climbed to 19.2°C on Thursday

KOLKATA: Summer temperatures in south Bengal are likely to remain normal while they will be slightly harsher in the north, according to the India Meteorological Department’s (IMD) outlook report released on Thursday.

Northwest, west and central India are also heading towards harsher weather between March and May, the report stated. The seasonal average temperature in south Bengal is likely to remain near the normal mark, though north Bengal is set to be warmer this summer. At least six districts of south Bengal that come under the core heat-wave zone of the country, however, are likely to see temperatures soar.

The seasonal average of maximum temperature is likely to remain between -0.5 and 0.5 of the normal mark from March to May. In north Bengal, on the other hand, it is likely to be 0.5°C to 1°C above normal. “Even though large parts of the country are expected to be warmer, south Bengal should experience a normal summer. But the districts of Bankura, Purulia, West Burdwan , Birbhum , Jhargram and West Midnapore could be warmer since they fall under the core heat-wave zone of the country,” said Regional Meteorological Centre (RMC) director G K Das.

Meanwhile, the minimum temperature in Kolkata climbed to 19.2°C on Thursday following overnight drizzle in some parts of the city. “Local cloud cells triggered shower in some areas, but there is no other system that can curb the rise in temperature now. It will remain around 18°C-19°C on Friday. But the maximum temperature is set to touch 30°C-31°C this weekend,” said Das. However, it will remain around 29C on Friday.

Explaining the reasons behind the rise in mercury, Das said that with the passing of winter, the cool northwesterly wind has stopped flowing in. Since there is no immediate possibility of further rain, the days will get warm, he said.

80,['28/02/2020'],"Caste-based census: Bihar CM Nitish Kumar plays ‘masterstroke’, again","This story is from February 28, 2020

Bihar CM Nitish Kumar

PATNA: Chief minister (CM) Nitish Kumar seems to be determined to lead the ruling NDA largely on his own terms and conditions. After catching BJP in its sleep while getting a resolution passed in the assembly against NRC and for implementation of only the 2010 format of NPR, he again played a masterstroke by getting a resolution passed for caste-based census in the state.

The caste-based census is a long pending demand of the JD(U) and it is the second time that a resolution for caste census was passed in the assembly. In February last year, the state assembly had passed a resolution recommending to the Centre to conduct caste-based census in 2021.

Nitish had said in the assembly prior to the passage of the special resolution that caste-based census was required to remove the present cap of 50% on reservation for increase in the quota for reserved categories of scheduled castes (SCs), scheduled tribes (STs) and other backward Classes (OBCs) on the basis of the increase in their population.

Nitish had again said in a special daylong session of the legislative assembly on January 13 this year that a proper caste-based census had not been done in the country after 1930. He had claimed that the caste census done in 2010 was not comprehensive as it was not done properly and its figures were also not published.

While BJP leaders did not speak much on the fresh resolution on caste-based census, the opposition RJD claimed that Nitish government got the resolution in this regard passed in the assembly under pressure from leader of opposition Tejashwi Prasad Yadav.

“It’s a historical fact that the social and spatial demarcation within India exists even today. SCs/STs/OBCs have been deprived socially and economically for ages. Caste-based census will provide a radical ground at the policy level for greater social and economic reforms,” Tejashwi tweeted hours after the resolution was passed by the assembly.

BJP MLC Sachchidanand Rai, however, said such decisions lead to division in the society. Without taking Nitish’s name, Rai said having majority does not mean that any proposal is passed in the assembly.

However, BJP MLC Naval Kishor Yadav said no one should be having any issue with caste-based census as it will reflect the actual status of people from different communities.

Earlier, the Bihar BJP leadership was virtually caught in their sleep when the special resolution against implementation of NRC and for implementation of NPR in its 2010 format was moved by Bihar legislative assembly Speaker Vijay Kumar Chaudhary and later approved unanimously by the House on Tuesday. Sources said the issue never came up for discussion in the joint meeting of the NDA.

81,['28/02/2020'],Patna: Work on garbage transfer station at Gardanibagh begins,"This story is from February 28, 2020

File photo of Patna Municipal Corporation

PATNA: The construction work on garbage transfer station for segregation of solid and wet waste has recently resumed at Gardanibagh after the Patna Municipal Corporation (PMC) selected a Delhi-based private firm for the job.

The construction work on transfer station was stopped after the urban development and housing department cancelled the contract with a private firm last year. The company was supposed to construct transfer stations, processing plant and waste-to- energy plant. However, it did not get the environment clearance from the ministry of environment, forest and climate change.

Altogether six transfer stations would come up in the city in the next six months, including four at Agamkuan garbage secondary point and two in Gardanibagh area.

Garbage collected from New Capital and Patliputra circles would be segregated at Gardanibagh, whereas garbage collected from Azimabad, Bankipore, Kankarbagh and Patna City will be segregated at Agamkuan.

PMC sources said six garbage transfer stations are to be constructed at the cost of Rs15 crore. Each transfer station would come up in 30x30sq metre area.

Patna mayor Sita Sahu said Gardanibagh transfer station would be ready within three months. “It will be have facilities like platforms, ramps and compactors. There will be a composting pit as well, where the organic fertilizers will be made through wet garbage, especially kitchen and garden waste, by using chemicals,” she said.

“The solid waste would be loaded in waste compactor to reduce the volume of trash. The compactor machines would compress the solid waste material to reduce the amount of space it takes up. The remaining garbage will be dumped at Ramchak Bairiya landfill site,” she added.

Indradeep Chandravanshi, a member of PMC’s empowered standing committee and councillor of ward number 48, said the construction work on Agamkuan garbage point would begin soon. “The segregated plastic waste will be sent to processing plant, which is being constructed at Ramchak Bairiya. It will be ready in 5-6 months,” he said.

The PMC has shortlisted the National Federation of Farmers’ Procurement, Processing and Retailing Cooperatives of India Ltd (NACOF) last week to operate the transfer station and segregation of waste.

The PMC would sign the agreement for next seven years to manage the composting pits, provide human resource, vehicles to transfer the segregated waste to processing plant and landfill site among other works.

JD(U) state president Bashishtha Narayan Singh

PATNA: JD(U) state president Bashishtha Narayan Singh on Thursday said the two meetings between CM Nitish Kumar and leader of opposition in state assembly Tejashwi Prasad Yadav earlier this week were just courtesy meetings. He said the NDA was strong and it would register an emphatic victory in the upcoming assembly elections in the state.

Bashishtha was addressing media persons at the JD(U) office here to announce the induction of former CPI functionary Shalini Mishra into the party. Asked about two meetings between Nitish and Tejashwi, Bashishtha said there was no hidden agenda behind it and nothing much should be read into the meetings.

“It is a common gesture of ruling leaders to meet those in the opposition. PM Narendra Modi also meets opposition leaders at the Centre. There is nothing unusual about it. Nevertheless, Tejashwi still spews venom against Nitish ji and state government through his speeches and yatras. Having a causal chat over a cup of tea should not be linked with politics,” Bashishtha said.

Tejashwi had met Nitish in his assembly chamber on Tuesday, minutes before the House adopted a resolution against implementation of National Register of Citizens (NRC) in the country. The two leaders met again in the chamber of assembly Speaker Vijay Kumar Chaudhary on Wednesday. According to sources, the Speaker, Nitish and RJD functionary Abdul Bari Siddiqui were already talking to each other, when an emissary was sent to invite Tejashwi as well for a cup of tea.

Meanwhile, Bashishtha claimed that JD(U)’s state-level ‘Karyakarta Sammelan’ at Gandhi Maidan in Patna on March 1 will be attended by over 2 lakh party workers.

83,['28/02/2020'],Indians dial up nearly 12GB a month,"(Representative image)

CHENNAI: Video consumption using 4G mobile technology drove data traffic in India last year, with an average of 70 minutes a day spent on over-the-top (OTT) platforms on phones. Monthly data usage also grew to 11.7GB a month from 10GB in 2018. The Mobile Broadband India Traffic Report from Nokia said that 2019 saw a 47% year-on-year (YoY) increase in data traffic, 96% of which was constituted by 4G, up from 92% in 2018.Most telecom operators have switched off their 3G networks in big cities and the consequential impact saw 3G connections witnessing the highest-ever decline of 30% during 2019. In 2018, a mere 1% subscribers surrendered 3G connections.Total data traffic grew by 44 times in 4 years and 2019 saw overall data subscribers grow to 600 million, the report added. The 4G device base grew in parallel by 1.5x, driven by the launch of a variety of models by brands’ aggressive pricing (VoLTE handsets — mobiles that have high-speed wireless communications — grew to 432 million). Despite the growth registered, broadband penetration in India is at around 47%, which is significantly lower compared to China at 95%, and other European nations at 95-115%Nokia senior VP & head (India market) Sanjay Malik said, “We believe the migration of subscribers to 4G will continue to drive broadband growth in the country. The upcoming 4K/8K videos and Industry 4.0 solutions that promise to enhance productivity and bring down expenses for the industries across different verticals demand ultra-high speed and extremely low latency. Indian telcos will need to consider other connectivity solutions to leverage the new opportunities and to address the growing data consumption.”A big factor for the increase in data traffic is video consumption. Viewers spend 12.5 times a week with an average of 40 minutes a session on OTT platforms, whose investments in original content has paid off. Mobile phones have become the dominant medium of consumption, taking up 88% of the total viewership.While OTT players have gained momentum through partnerships with DTH players and by offering sachet pricing and mobile-only packages, the mobile operators — fuelled by Reliance Jio — are offering internet at affordable rates to drive data traffic. The report says that Indian operators offer the cheapest mobile data at Rs 7/GB, down from Rs 226 in 2015. They have also increased their rural penetration to 27.6% from 13% in 2016.",business,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74381934,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-50719,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/indians-dial-up-nearly-12gb-a-month/articleshow/74344855.cms

PATNA: A 60-year-old man, Arjun Das, was beaten to death at Nadpura village under the Punpun police station area in Patna district, police said on Thursday.

Police said a group of people attacked Arjun with sticks and iron rods following a dispute over barking of pet dog belonging to one Madan Das.

Arjun’s son Shambhu Das told police that his neighbour Madan got agitated after his dog entered his house and touched eatables in the kitchen.

The altercation between the two rival groups led to the death of Arjun. Police said altogether 10 people were made named accused in the case. Three of them have been arrested by the police.

85,['28/02/2020'],How businesses help ease pain of bereaved,"(Representative image)

MUMBAI: When a loved one passes away, all that their relatives and friends are left with are personal belongings and fond memories. While the sorrow of losing a loved one — either to old age or to an unfortunate event — is acute, the remedies to fill in the vacuum created in one’s life are growing as well.Traditionally, individuals in bereavement find solace in prayer. Some try to get past the pain by engrossing themselves in various hobbies, while others drown themselves in work to overcome their agony. No matter how morbid it may sound, the business around helping people in their grief has found traction, owing to the acceptance that one doesn’t live forever.Flowers and gifting company Ferns N Petals has come up with a ‘flower will’ — a subscription service that allows one to send flowers to their loved ones, even after they are gone. The sender can choose a plan varying from 5 to 20 years and assign an ‘informer’. The company’s founder & MD Vikaas Gutgutia said the just-launched ‘flower will’ plan has received a good response on social media.Initially, the campaign revolves around the husband-wife relation. But Gutgutia said the company will explore emotions across relations in future. “Death is an integral part of life. Yet, we cry when somebody departs. We were working on how departing can be made different. We said to ourselves that flowers must have a role to play here and we would be the medium to make that happen. True love continues even after death , and thus we came up with the line ‘Love forever’,” said Gutgutia.This campaign is similar to the one by LIC, titled ‘Zindagi ke saath bhi, zindagi ke baad bhi’. The insurance industry has for decades tried to explain the importance of safeguarding near and dear ones financially after the breadearner’s death. But people usually avoid conversations around the subject of death and such skepticism has only posed hurdles in marketing life insurance. The campaign is said to have cut some ice with consumers, with more takers for life insurance products today.Beyond the circle of friends and relatives, there are services which comfort those in bereavement. Religious tourism is one. People rush to religious sites to pray for the departed soul as such moves warm the cockles of the heart. Many others find an outlet through social media by posting pictures of their departed loved one, while some turn to other beliefs.Mumbai-based tarot reader Sapna Shahri said, “I find that people in grief are very closed and do not want to expose their vulnerability. Out of 10, I get about 3 cases of people wanting some communication with their loved one who has passed over. After this, they seem to accept it better and it is more like a completion for them.” Tarot readers on an average charge from Rs 2,000 to even Rs 5,000 per hour.Harish Bijoor, brand strategy expert and founder of Harish Bijoor Consults Inc, said, “I do believe these services fill a gap and offer solutions. The Ferns N Petals offer is surely one such. Email and messaging services that offer to bank ‘message wills’ into the future are another. On designated days, messages pre-made by the person concerned will be automatically dispatched. A kid can receive such a message well into adulthood from a person who is physically no more.” However, from a healing point of view, Bijoor said all these marketing tools and devices are fighting the natural. “Death is but natural. Prolonging the communication on memory process fights healing in a way as well. Therefore, we as a people need to go with nature and obey its wills. Nature makes a will of its own, and a ‘flower will’ fights that in its own way as well,” he said.Since those in bereavement are also naturally depressed, Many take recourse in mental health helplines, which have in recent years seen a surge in the number of calls due to the growing awareness on mental wellness. “It’s normal to grieve for a loved one, and in eight weeks most people accept it and move on. There are some who may take longer to overcome the grief. They should pick up signs of anxiety and seek help,” said Anjali Chhabria, a psychiatrist & founder of MindTemple .",business,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74380382,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1155091,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/how-businesses-help-ease-pain-of-bereaved/articleshow/74347998.cms

87,['28/02/2020'],IndusInd insider Kathpalia to be bank’s next MD &amp; CEO,"This story is from February 28, 2020

Sumant Kathpalia (File photo)

MUMBAI: The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has cleared the appointment of Sumant Kathpalia as the MD & CEO of IndusInd Bank . As a result, Kathpalia will succeed Romesh Sobti who retires next month.

The appointment, which is for a period of three years from March 24 this year, puts an end to speculation on the succession issue at IndusInd Bank. Sobti, who headed it since February 2008, has to step down as the RBI did not relent on the 70-year age limit for bank CEOs. The bank had last year announced that a board-level committee had identified a successor and submitted the name of the candidate to the RBI. It, however, did not name the candidate.

“We now advise that the bank has received a communication from the RBI today, approving the appointment of Kathpalia, who currently heads the consumer banking business,” a statement to the exchanges said.

IndusInd Bank, the first new-age lender to get a licence from the RBI, commenced operations in 1994. Sobti had brought about a transformation in the bank, increasing the focus on retail and reducing pressure of stressed assets.

Kathpalia — a qualified chartered accountant and a commerce graduate from Hindu College , Delhi — is a career banker with over 33 years of experience. He has worked in multinational banks such as Citi , Bank of America and ABN Amro before joining IndusInd Bank.

He has diversified experience across various functions, including business strategy, sales & distribution, operations, systems, risk and credit.

While IndusInd Bank has had a good run for most of Sobti’s term, it has been under pressure after it revealed an exposure of around Rs 3,000 crore to IL&FS. The bank’s shares are currently trading at Rs 1,116, compared to its 52-week high of Rs 1,835. The bank currently has a market capitalisation of Rs 77,360 crore.

Earlier this month, rating agency Moody’s had revised the outlook on the bank to negative citing deterioration in its asset quality. “The bank has a relatively higher exposure to real estate compared to other banks (at around 8% of its loan book as of December 31, 2019). While there have been no NPLs in this segment so far, this exposure to the property market remains a source of risk, given the broader stress in the real estate sector. The bank could also be negatively impacted by the ongoing stress in the telecommunications sector,” Moody’s had said.

The students had arrived at the university head office on UM Road to make a representation against the MOU signed by the university with a private institute that runs event management and sport management courses.

The students alleged that the university officials signed the MoU with the Mumbai-based institute without following the procedures.

""The institute will be provided space in the university premises to conduct classes for 20 per cent share from fees. The institute will be charging fees as high as Rs6 lakh,"" said one of the student leaders.

""Surprisingly, no syndicate member objected to the MoU when it was brought before the syndicate. The syndicate members cleared it despite the institute’s high fees,"" said Kanu Bharwad, a senate member.

The students grilled Rajendra Patel for over an hour in visitors' room and didn’t allow him to go to his office.

Meanwhile, VNSGU vice-chancellor Shivendra Gupta said, ""The MoU has been signed based on syndicate’s resolution. Approvals from various university bodies are yet to be taken. The MOU is not final as yet.""

More alarming is that noise levels during night time were also quiet high compared to the required limit

SURAT: The Diamond city know for its vibrant lifestyle and exuberant night life has a reason to be worried.

A study by the environment cell of the civil engineering department of Sardar Vallabhbhai National Institute of Technology (SVNIT) has found that noise levels in the city were significantly higher than than the norms prescribed by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB). What is more alarming is that noise levels during night time were also quiet high compared to the required limit.

The noise mapping study was conducted by Dr B N Tandel, assistant professor, environment cell at SVNIT and his PhD student Dipesh Sonaviya at five location in the west zone of the city. The aim was to study the propagation of urban road traffic noise in the areas along with field measurements. “Vehicular sound is major source of noise pollution in urban areas and therefore many countries have noise emission limits for vehicles. They also have legislations to regulate traffic noise,” Tandel told TOI. “We also need to realise the consequences of high noise pollution on human health.”

“The study findings should worry us all. It indicates that the noise levels are significantly higher even during night time and it could have serious health implications on residents,” he added.

Of the total seven zones in Surat, the researchers selected west zone for noise mapping because it includes diversified activities like vehicles, residences, commercial establishments and corporate offices. Three road stretches of 1 km each, forming a triangle, were selected for collecting noise level data. In all five locations were monitored for noise levels.

“We have ignored the ill effects of noise pollution in the study. This is a progressive problem and therefore people do not realise it as a serious issue. But it can affect work productivity as well as sleep pattern. More studies need to be conducted with the help of medical fraternity about effects of noise pollution on humans physiology and psychology,” Tandel added.

SRS president Jaisukh Gajera told TOI, “An urgent meeting of representatives of diamond workers’ community and office-bearers of SRS has been convened on Friday to take the decision on announcing a two-day strike in the industry over professional tax issue.”

Gajera added, “On February 10, we met deputy chief minister Nitin Patel in Gandhinagar and demanded abolition of professional tax for diamond workers. The minister informed us that the labour department falls under the jurisdiction of chief minister. There has been no favourable reply from the state government so far. Diamond workers earn on piece meal basis and yet they have to pay professional tax to the state government. Majority of workers are employed in small and medium diamond units and earn less than Rs15,000 per month.”

Gajera said Surat Municipal Corporation (SMC) collects professional tax on behalf of the state government. The yearly collection of professional tax from the diamond industry has been pegged at Rs150 crore.

Picture used for representational purpose only

PATNA: Valmiki Tiger Reserve ( VTR ) in West Champaran will soon be under the surveillance of a drone camera.

VTR officials said the drone camera will not only monitor animals and keep a count on them but will also help in assessing the entire reserve. Field director HK Roy said the camera will help the patrolling teams to keep an eye on the movement of animals, especially tigers and leopards. “The high-resolution drone camera will also help in gathering information and images, including the location of animals in case they try to escape from the tiger reserve,” Roy said.

He added, “On several occasions, wild animals flee from VTR and hide in sugarcane farms. It becomes quite difficult for our patrolling teams to locate them. The drone camera will not only help in tracing their locations but will also keep people safe from wild animals.”

Spread in an area of 901.07 sq km, the VTR comprises eight forest ranges with two divisions — Govardhana, Rangia, and Manguraha ranges in Division I and Harnapand, Chiutaha, Madanpur, Valmiki Nagar, and Ganauli in Division II. Thousands of mammals, birds, reptiles and butterflies can be sighted at VTR due to which keeping a check on them becomes very difficult.

“Order for procurement of drone camera has already been placed. After the procurement, patrolling teams at VTR will be trained by the supplier. It will be used for monitoring from mid-March. As of now, only one drone camera worth Rs3.5lakh will be used. If things go well, we will procure one more drone next year,” Roy said.

Meanwhile, the ecotourism package for the Valmiki Tiger Reserve has been in demand since its launch by the forest department on December 21 last year. Priced at Rs 1,500 per person, the two-day ecotourism package includes transportation from Patna to VTR, food and accommodation for 16 tourists. “The weekend tour package is witnessing good response as all the slots get booked within an hour or two. Besides, people can avail the tour package till June as tourism sector at VTR remains shut from July to September,” Roy said.

103,['28/02/2020'],"U’khand govt’s declaration of eco-sensitive zone of Rajaji Tiger Reserve will not hold as it violates buffer zone guidelines of NTCA, say wildlife activists","This story is from February 28, 2020

Dehradun: A day after the Uttarakhand government in a cabinet meeting declared an area of 270 sqkm outside Rajaji National Park as eco-sensitive zone (ESZ), wildlife activists and scientists pointed out on Thursday that the government is yet to declare a ‘1-km area outward from the boundary of the tiger reserve’ as buffer zone as stipulated by guidelines of the National Tiger Conservation Authorty (NTCA).

They added that the proposal by the state government “is bound to get stuck in the ministry of environment and forests (MoEF) as it fails to address the important issue of ‘buffer zone’ as mandated by NTCA.” Buffer zone is an area inside a protected area which is intended to reinforce its conservation.

Eco-sensitive zones on the other hand are areas within 10km of a protected area, national park or wildlife sanctuary which are formed to minimise the negative impacts of certain activities (construction works, mining etc) around these protected areas.

Wildlife activists point out that there are around 95 villages which fall in the buffer area of Rajaji. With the cabinet decision of Wednesday including only 22 villages in the eco-sensitive zone, rest of the villages have been kept out of both buffer zone as well as eco-sensitive zone. This, they said, was a problem point.

A senior scientist from Wildlife Institute of India (WII), told TOI, “NTCA guidelines clearly state that all the tiger reserves in the country should have at least 1 km around the reserve’s boundary as buffer zone. And all pre-existing buffer zones are automatically a part of eco-sensitive zone.”

Interestingly, the government has provisioned for different activities to take place in ESZs like building hotel etc after obtaining permissions.

Reacting to this, Doon-based nature activist Reenu Paul said, “Once an area is declared ESZ, then there should be no clause of giving permission to villagers for any kind of work. The idea of giving permission via a ‘competent authority’ is nothing but methods to violate environmental laws. It is totally illegal and in violation of wildlife protection Act.”

Other activists also raised questions on the exclusion of around 803 villages in Rajaji from the ESZ. “This is nothing but a ploy to appease villagers,” said Vasu Kirti, an activist.

Meanwhile, reacting to the concerns, principal secretary of Uttarakhand forest department, Anand Bardhan, said, “These matters are being looked into by competent authorities. The proposal will go to the Union government from where we will get a final approval.”

Nainital: Taking a swipe at the lantern yatra launched by Uttarakhand Congress on Wednesday, chief minister Trivendra Singh Rawat said on Thursday that the rally held by the opposition party was “more about finding Harish Rawat in state politics rather than searching for development under the BJP rule.”

CM Rawat, who was in Nainital on Thursday, said, “It is a matter of research as to whether the rally was aimed at finding development in the state or finding Harish Rawat, who had gone missing from the state politics. But the good thing is that Harish Rawat has finally been found.”

With the state government about to complete three years in office on March 18, the Congress party had taken out a symbolic rally in Haldwani with lanterns ostensibly to look for development works under the ruling BJP.

While speaking to mediapersons, CM Rawat said that the government will hold 70 events in 70 assembly constituencies of the state to showcase development works undertaken in the past three years. “We will give an account of every single penny that has been spent by our government in the past three years for development works,” he said.

The CM also inaugurated several schemes and projects worth over Rs 113 crore in Haldwani. This included a foundation stone laying ceremony of projects worth more than Rs 64.89 crore. Rawat also announced that a budget of Rs 20 crore would be spent on repairing and developing the secondary roads of Haldwani.

Addressing the gathering, CM Rawat said that more than 500 schools in the state now have smart classes and another 700 schools will soon have the facility. “All the anganwadi centres will have their own buildings and every village in the state will be connected by roads by 2022. Our government is also committed to building an ISBT in Haldwani and we are working to ensure that the Jamrani dam project provides water to the entire Terai region,” the CM said.

Central Bureau of Investigation

LUCKNOW: The Central Bureau of Investigation ( CBI ) on Thursday lodged another FIR against Kanpur-based Rotomac Exim for duping Allahabad Bank to the tune of Rs 36 crore. It was alleged in the bank’s complaint that the company took laon using shell firms and didn’t pay back

The FIR was registered against the company’s promoters, Vikram Kothari and Rahul Kothari, on the charges of criminal conspiracy, cheating, forgery for the purpose of cheating, using forged document as genuine, falsification of accounts and criminal misconduct.

Earlier in February 2018, the CBI’s anti-corruption branch of Delhi unit had also lodged an FIR against the Kotharis on the basis of a complaint from Bank of Baroda for allegedly swindling over Rs 800 crore. The CBI had then arrested the two, but they are now out on bail.

The Thursday’s FIR was lodged on the complaint of Amarjeet Singh Hira, the deputy general manager of Allahabad Bank. The CBI in its preliminary investigation found that company and its promoters used shell firms without any genuine business transactions to seek loan.

The company forged and fabricated documents showing false bills of transaction to avail credit limit of Rs 50 crore, the CBI probe found. The company and its promoters also failed to pay back the loan, says the agency which also hinted at the role of many public servants in the fraud.

A CBI officer said that Allahabad Bank had sanctioned Rs Rs 42-crore loan to Rotomac on October 3, 2010, but did not get back the due amount with interest. The fraud was detected when the CBI probed the company’stransactions. After that, the bank also sold a property of the owners and got back Rs 6 crore, but Rs 36 core were still due. The ED had also attached assets worth Rs 177 crore in connection with money laundering probe against the Rotomac group in an alleged bank loan fraud of Rs 3,695 crore in May, 2018.

108,['28/02/2020'],NMC stops collecting user charge for lifting garbage,"This story is from February 28, 2020

Nagpur: The Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) has abruptly stopped collecting user charge for doorstep lifting of garbage.

Of the 6.5 lakh properties in the city limits, only 2.43% property owners have paid the user charge. “The NMC, which imposed user charge from August 2019 has so far been able to collect Rs10,05,110 from 15,812 property owners — mostly residential. Since the last couple of months, we have stopped collecting user charges,” confirmed a senior official from the solid waste management department.

The official said the NMC levied user charge after the state government had issued a resolution in July 2019 about the collection of ‘garbage collection user charges’ that the citizens had to pay for the service in their respective civic limits. The charges depend on how a municipal corporation is categorized and population. As the NMC falls under the B-grade category, each house was supposed to pay Rs60 as monthly charge for the service.

Educational and religious institutes, hostels and government/semi-government offices were to pay Rs120 as monthly charges for the service. Marriage and entertainment halls, single-screen theatres and purchase centres/multi-screen theatre too had to pay Rs2,000.

If the civic body had strictly implemented the GR, the NMC is likely to get revenue of around Rs3.5 crore per month under the head from around 6.5 lakh properties. The state government had made mandatory for the NMC to collect the charges of Rs60 per month from residential users, 90 from commercial followed by other categories. The NMC has selected 100 sanitary inspectors, 10 from each of ten zones, who were supposed to collect the charges from all properties.

As it was mandatory for the civic body to impose user charge, initially, the sanitation department employees tried to recover mandatory user charges but faced opposition from not only citizens but also from elected representatives.

Following directives from the then mayor Nanda Jichkar, the health department had submitted a proposal to levy user charge before the general body. Instead of okaying the proposal, it was referred to the health committee. Now, the ruling party and even the civic administration had kept it in the cold storage.

The civic body also failed to implement another important provision of the GR to slap fine on people not segregating garbage at source. The quantum for the fine for the first offence is Rs300. Every subsequent offence will invite a penalty of Rs500. “Neither the citizens are handing over segregated garbage nor the NMC has started imposing fine,” the officer admitted.

Despite the fact that set-up of e-library is counted as one of the parameters of evaluation in National Assessment and Accreditation Council (NAAC), not all the government colleges of Indore district have one.

Moreover, colleges that have one either don’t have sufficient number of subscription or students are not made aware about its presence.

Govt Maharani Laxmi Bai Girls PG College (New GDC College) has set-up of 15 computers for e-libraries. However, they have no subscription of any site for e-books.

The college had taken subscriptions for journals, which costs Rs 5000 per year and has a set of 25 books that were downloaded free of cost from internet by librarian, principal of New GDC College Dr Kusumlata Nigwal said.

The college has set up for e-library and even has subscription of journals and Nigwal affirms that it can be accessed by undergraduate students.

Govt Holkar Science College and Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee Government Arts and Commerce College (GACC) have e-library and the access is given to all students including undergraduate students. While Holkar has around 25 computers for e-library, GACC has around 10-15 computers that gives access to e-content subscribed by the institute.

The e-library is not getting used by students as most of undergraduate and postgraduate students are unaware of it. While Govt Mata Jija Bai Girls P G College (Old GDC) still hasn’t got set up for e-library yet, they have already applied for it.

“The department had invited applications for setting of e-libraries and we have already applied for it. We are waiting for their approval and funds. We will try to set it this year itself,” principal of Old GDC College Sumitra Waskel told TOI.

CM Uddhav Thackeray

AYODHYA: Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray is scheduled to visit Ayodhya on March 7 on the 100th day of his coming to power in a clear political signal to allies Congress and NCP that Shiv Sena’s core Hindutva agenda remains intact despite being in a secular alliance.

Sena MP Sanjay Raut, who reached Faizabad on Thursday to make arrangements for Uddhav’s visit told TOI that he would be meeting UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath on Friday.

To a query on whether the party was deviating from the common minimum programme laid out by the alliance, he said, “We don’t need a visa or permission from anybody to come to Ayodhya. Uddhavji will seek blessings from Ram Lalla . The basic tenets of Sena remain intact. Remember, he’s not visiting Ayodhya for the first time,” he said.

However, BJP’s grassroot workers in Ayodhya are not amused. Reacting to the Sena leader’s visit, BJP’s Ayodhya district president Sanjeev Singh said, “It’s move steeped in hypocrisy. Uddhav Thackeray humiliated Lord Ram the day he formed an alliance with those who term the Lord as imaginary. He formed the government in his hunger for power and buried idealism of Sena patriarch Bal Thackeray.”

However, the Sena’s biggest ally, Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) is in sync with Uddhav's Ayodhya tryst. Talking to TOI over phone, NCP national spokesman and minister in Maharashtra government Nawab Malik, said, “The Ayodhya issue is no more disputed. Every individual has the right to perform his religious duties. After SC’s verdict, everything is clear. So Uddhavji’s visit to Ayodhya is personal and no one has the right to comment.”

111,['28/02/2020'],Mission hopes for a LIFE line,"This story is from February 28, 2020

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: LIFE housing mission which is basking in the glory of milestone achievement of completion of 2 lakh houses will now go into the most crucial third phase where the project officials will have to work out a solution to address three crucial factors — money, dearth of land and demand for housing.

The third phase was conceived to construct apartment complexes for those who did not have land and home. The final number of beneficiaries following verification stands at 1.06 lakh in the third phase. For this year, LIFE mission plans to complete 100 apartment complexes using dry construction pre-fab technology. The mission officials estimate that only around 7,000 beneficiaries could be accommodated in 100 apartment complexes.

The officials are hence trying to divert some of the beneficiaries from third phase to second phase mainly due to cost factor. Local bodies are being encouraged to purchase land, if possible, for these beneficiaries and then they can be given houses by spending Rs 4 lakh per beneficiary. The cumulative cost would be less than the government’s fund allocation (Rs 7 lakh) for a house under LIFE misssion.

When the mission began, each unit in an apartment complex was estimated to cost Rs 10.25 lakh; this estimate has now touched Rs 14 lakh per unit. The officials are hence pushing beneficiaries to opt for second phase where a house can be given at half the actual price required for a housing unit in an apartment complex.

“We estimate that around 27,000 of the beneficiaries included in the third phase could be given housing either directly in apartment complexes or in houses under second phase. Around 7,000 beneficiaries will be given housing through sponsorship in third phase. That would leave us with over 60,000 beneficiaries for whom a massive housing campaign will have to be launched,” said U V Jose, CEO, LIFE housing mission.

The project wing had initially estimated to find nearly 1,000 acres for apartment complexes. At present, the mission has identified 374.92 acres in 314 places which are owned either by various departments or by local government institutions. LIFE mission already runs on loan amount of Rs 4,000 crore from HUDCO , and Rs 425 crore as bridge loan from Ernakulam District Cooperative bank. The state budget for 2020-21 has pumped in another Rs 2,000 crore, but given the demand for housing and cost of private land required for apartments, this amount would scarcely meet the requirement. “At present we may not need another loan and even if it is required we have the support to go for it,” said Jose.

A housing tower which will come up in each district will have about 44 dwelling units in the housing complex. It shall be built with light gauge steel framed structure system in combination with pre-engineered steel structural system (PEB) to promote sustainable housing. The size of each unit shall be of plinth area 500sqft and minimum carpet area 400sqft in accordance with the prevailing guidelines of the LIFE Mission.

112,['28/02/2020'],Sambalpur farmers reiterate opposition to token system,"This story is from February 28, 2020

Farmers at the meeting in Sambalpur on Thursday

SAMBALPUR: Farmers of Sambalpur on Thursday opposed the existing centralised token system and demanded rectification of shortcomings in the existing system for procurement of paddy during the upcoming rabi paddy procurement season. The farmers have also threatened that they will not register themselves to take part in the rabi paddy procurement process if the government does not rectify the shortcomings. The registration for the rabi paddy procurement will begin from March 1.

Addressing the media after a meeting, adviser to the Sambalpur Zilla Krushak Surakhya Sangathan (SZKSS), Ashok Pradhan, said, “Farmers suffered due to the existing token system during this kharif paddy procurement. Many farmers could not sell their paddy as their token lapsed during the procurement. Similarly, paddy of many farmers remained unsold as they did not receive the requisite tokens to sell all the paddy they had produced. Many registered farmers also failed to sell their paddy as the government stopped the procurement in the district on February 23.” According to the policy of the government, the market yard should remain open till March 30 so that all the registered farmers could sell their kharif paddy, said a farmer.

Pradhan said before the kharif paddy procurement, the government had assured that the centralised token system would make the paddy procurement process transparent and reduce the role of middlemen. But because of the existing token system, many farmers had to resort to distress sale as they failed to sell their paddy in the market yards, he said.

He further said though a target was set to procure 30,55,860 quintal of paddy during this kharif, the food supplies and consumer welfare department stopped the process after procuring only 29,78,852. 96 quintal of paddy in the district.

“We would not tolerate this during the rabi paddy procurement process. We want the government to discuss with us to bring in the changes in the existing token system so that the farmers will not have to face problems during rabi paddy procurement,” he said.

Pradhan added, “The farmers of the district will not register themselves for taking part in the rabi paddy procurement process if the government does not hold discussions with the farmers’ outfit.”

Thiruvananthapuram: The government is closing in towards formation of toddy board that has been a long-pending demand of labourers working in the toddy sector, chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan said here on Thursday.

Inaugurating the golden jubilee celebrations of Kerala toddy workers’ welfare fund board, the chief minister said as many as one lakh people are working in this sector. At the same time, an uncertainty in the sector has affected the labourers. The government is duty-bound to rectify the issues and promote the sector, he said.

After the LDF government came to power, several steps have been taken to address the issues in the sector, the CM said. The government has revised and fixed the minimum wages of the labourers in this sector. At present, there are 27,384 labourers and 16,721 pensioners under the welfare fund. In addition to the schemes like accident insurance, scholarship, aid for family members after the death of a member, the government is also offering pensions on the basis of number of years that a member has served and the amount ranges from Rs 2,000 to Rs 5,000 per month.

Since April 2018, the members of the welfare fund board have been included in the comprehensive health insurance scheme also, that would offer health benefits up to Rs 5 lakh. Several families have been availing this benefit, the chief minister said.

Several other schemes like offering Rs 40,000 for marriage assistance for daughters of members, Rs 50,000 for those who have put in the highest period of service while retiring from each district, providing laptops for the children of members who have taken admission to post-graduate courses, etc. are some of the other schemes that the government has devised, he said.

It is in addition to all these that the government is coming up with life insurance scheme by joining hands with the LIC, in which a member’s family will receive Rs 1 lakh in the wake of natural or unnatural death of a member.

VARANASI: Ahead of the visit of Union HRD minister Ramesh Pokhriyal Nishank on Thursday, several hoardings demanding action against the vice-chancellor of Banaras Hindu University for alleged discrimination with Hindi-speaking students, appeared in different localities of the city on Wednesday night. The Union minister was in the city to lay foundation of student’s activity centre, boy’s hostel and faculty residential block at IIT-BHU and to attend other functions.

The hoardings demanded action against the VC for alleged partiality done with the Hindi-speaking candidates during interviews held for position of assistant professors. Similar hoardings had also appeared before the recent visit of Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

These hoardings, reading ‘Rajbhasha Hindi ki upeksha va apman kyon’ (why Rajbhasha Hindi is ignored and insulted) and ‘Rajbhasha Hindi ko Rashtrabhasha ghosit kiya jaye’ (Rajbhasha Hindi should be made Rashtrabhasha), could be seen in Lanka, Maldahiya and Ravindrapuri areas. They also demanded a judicial probe into the recruitment process of assistant professors.

“We strongly oppose the partiality done to Hindi-speaking candidates in the interviews for the teaching position,” said a fellow of BHU Dr Karn Kumar Singh, who had also faced an interview for the post of assistant professor at the department of Ancient Indian History and Culture & Archaeology in the first week of January.

He alleged that he was asked to answer only in English during the interview. The Hindi-speaking students had been opposing the biased attitude of the BHU authority towards Rajbhasah Hindi, he added. Similar hoardings had appeared earlier also during the international alumni meet of BHU in the city on January 17.

The controversy began after Hindi-speaking candidates, in interview for the post of assistant professor at the department of Ancient Indian History and Culture & Archaeology were allegedly suggested to learn English to qualify.

Earlier, a group of students had also staged demonstration on January 4 and submitted a memorandum to the office of registrar alleging that the Hindi-speaking candidates were misbehaved with and discouraged to take part in the interview. However, BHU spokesperson Rajesh Singh denied the allegation saying that the interview was conducted as per the prescribed norms and no one misbehaved with the candidates neither any partiality was done to them.

116,['28/02/2020'],230 pilgrims sent back from Karipur,"This story is from February 28, 2020

Kozhikode: More than 230 umrah pilgrims who were scheduled to travel to Saudi Arabia were sent back from the Karipur airport on Thursday following the temporary ban imposed by the kingdom for umrah visa holders as part of its Covid-19 precautionary measures.

The decision would affect the umrah plans of thousands of pilgrims from the state.

Around 90 pilgrims who were scheduled to fly in the SpiceJet flight from Karipur to Jeddah at 5.30am had to be offloaded as the airline authorities came to know about the decision just before take-off. Also, 15 passengers who were on visit visa were not allowed to travel.

As many as 88 umrah pilgrims who were to travel in the Saudi Arabian Airlines (Saudia) flight to Jeddah too could not travel along with 43 pilgrim passengers of an Etihad Airways flight.

It was late on Wednesday night that the Saudi authorities announced a temporary ban on those entering the kingdom for umrah and/or visiting the Prophet’s Mosque in Medina. The entry of tourist visa holders from countries with confirmed coronavirus outbreaks, according to criteria established by Saudi authorities, has also been temporarily suspended.

Many passengers who had completed check-in and wearing the customary dress as part of the umrah pilgrimage shared their disappointment on not being able to undertake the pilgrimage.

“We are deeply saddened that the pilgrimage had to be called off at the last moment,” said a pilgrim who arrived at the airport.

Saudi Arabian Airlines officials however informed trade partners in the afternoon that passengers holding employment, work visit visas, business visit visas and family visit visas can be accepted for travel.

P V Vijesh, manager at Al Hind Tours and Travels said they were looking forward to a good umrah season with around 400 pilgrim bookings per month and the decision would certainly affect business.

Jaipur: Chief minister Ashok Gehlot on Thursday questioned the transfer of Delhi High Court Judge S Muralidhar and asked the Centre what message it was trying to convey to the masses.

The notification of Justice Muralidhar's transfer to Punjab and Haryana High Court came late on Wednesday evening, on a day when a bench headed by him expressed “anguish” over Delhi Police’s failure to register FIRs against alleged hate speeches by BJP leaders Parvesh Verma, Kapil Mishra and Anurag Thakur.

“What message is the central government trying to convey by transferring Justice Muralidhar who showed his resentment against police inaction during Delhi violence and their failure to act against BJP leaders for their hate speeches,” Gehlot tweeted on Thursday.

“People have so much faith in the judiciary and the government’s attempts to undermine the justice system are very unfortunate,” he said.

Justice Muralidhar while conducting a special hearing at his residence on Delhi violence had said the court would not allow a repeat of 1984 to occur on its watch and directed police ensure safe passage to the injured.

Chand Bagh

NEW DELHI: A day after the discovery of an IB official’s body in a Chand Bagh drain, two more bodies were found floating in Gokulpuri drain near Ganga Vihar junction on Thursday morning. The news spread like wildfire and the authorities started sifting through the clogged drains in northeast Delhi to check if there were more bodies of riot victims stuck in them.

Anil Tyagi, employee of irrigation and flood department, said that bloated bodies were found stuck in floating garbage around 8am on Thursday. “As the news spread, a crowd started building up. But since curfew is imposed in the area, forces soon arrived and dispersed the gathering,” he added.

Both the bodies were removed around 11am. They were not identified till Thursday evening.

When TOI visited the area around 2.30pm, flag marches were being carried out in the colonies aligned along the length of the drain. “Section 144 has been imposed and shoot at sight orders have been received. People are being requested to go to their houses,” a senior police officer was heard announcing on the loudspeakers.

Ranjeet Kumar (62), a resident of Bhagirathi Vihar, claimed that the deceased did not belong to the locality and his body might have flown from Mustafabad.

The garbage-strewn drains were being scanned by civic officials and police for bodies. A joint meeting in this regard was also held among officials of irrigation and flood department, East Delhi Municipal Corporation and police. EDMC commissioner Dr Dilraj Kaur and spokesperson Arun Kumar later said that the civic body was ready to provide all necessary help to police for the discovery of bodies.

TOI also spoke to the relatives of a few other riot victims whose bodies were fished out of the drains earlier.

Musharraf’s body was found in the Chand Bagh drain. “We went everywhere but did not find him until someone known to Musharraf (35) told us that he was thrown into the drain. When we could not find him in the drain, we visited GTB Hospital on Thursday morning and found his body there,” said Farheen, the victim’s sister.

Mohseen’s (24) body was found in Bhajanpura drain. “Around 5pm on Tuesday, he had to come to Bhajanpura for some work. A mob surrounded his car and asked him to remove his pants. He managed to call up one of his friends. But before anyone could do anything to save him, the men bashed him and threw him in a drain,” said Waris Ali Khan, Mohseen’s uncle.

Nashik: Gold ornaments worth Rs 1.25 lakh were stolen from a flat in Vrindavan Nagar between January 28 and February 20.

An unidentified person allegedly stole the ornaments by entering the house using a key kept hidden inside a shoe in a shoe rack outside the flat.

The case was registered on Wednesday.

Complainant Digambar Patil, a 58-year-old resident of Pride apartment, had gone out of town with his family. The Patils had locked the flat before leaving, but had left a key in the shoe rack for a relative who was supposed to come home in their absence.

According to the police, an unidentified person may have kept a close watch on the movement of the family members. On finding a suitable opportunity, the thief entered the house and stole the ornaments.

The complainant said that the person has allegedly stolen the gold ornaments worth Rs 1.25 lakh kept in the cupboard. The person also closed the doors before leaving to ensure that no one in the neighbourhood suspected that the flat had been burgled.

The police suspect that it was done by a person who knew the family members and their arrangement of keeping the house keys in the shoe rack outside.

“Somebody must have kept a close watch on the members of the family. The thief may have heard them talk about the arrangement or may even have seen them actually keep the key there,” the police said. The police suspect this person may even have taken some insider’s help to figure out when the family would be out of the house for a long duration.

The police said they are investigating the matter. A habitual criminal’s involvement was not ruled out either.

Nagpur: As Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) workers displayed their skills in martial arts, like unarmed combat and stick wielding, sarsanghchalak Mohan Bhagwat said the organization is committed to the spirit of nationalism as propagated by Vinayak Damodar Savarkar.

Reciting a few lines from the poem written by Savarkar — ‘Jari uddhara née vyaya tichya ho saacha, haa vyartha bhaar vidyecha’, which roughly translates into — all the learning is futile if it is not used for the nation, Bhagwat said RSS is an organization that implements his message in its entirety.

The Nagpur unit of RSS held a display of physical activities like yoga, and martial arts at Yeshwant Stadium on Thursday. Usually, such mass displays are held during Vijayadashmi function when RSS marks its foundation day.

Senior RSS functionaries said it was a display of the training undertaken by workers during Hindu calender year. Even two years ago, a similar function was held at Chitnis Park.

On the training, Bhagwat said it is an integral part of a swayamsevak’s life which is practised like a strict penance. Strength is one of the requisites for achieving any goal, he added.

“However, this should come with self control. On the RSS’ nature of activities, he said, in the organization, more than individual betterment, the motive is on achieving a common goal of serving the nation. Each individual is committed to the nation and any endeavour to achieve it is done with the objective of deriving more strength to serve the nation,” he said.

Earlier during a function at Hingna, sarkaryawah (general secretary) of RSS Bhaiyyaji Joshi spoke to an agency about the riots in Delhi. He said nobody has the right to take law into hands and the Centre should ensure that peace is restored which has been wrecked by communal violence.

“Necessary action should be taken to restore law and order in the national capital. The government should establish peace in the areas where there is ‘ashanti’ (unrest),” he said.

Communal riots, which broke out in various parts of northeast Delhi over the amended citizenship law on Sunday, have so far claimed 34 lives. More than 200 people were injured in riots in the national capital where the police department comes under the Union home ministry.

Nashik: Opposition by 93 farmers in Jalgaon district, who have been protesting against the sale of land through the direct settlement method, has delayed a major Railway project.

The project — laying of the third track between Jalgaon and Manmad junctions — was discussed on Thursday during a video conference between Union railway minister Piyush Goyal and chief secretary of Maharashtra Ajoy Mehta.

Manmad junction is along the Central Railway route, between Mumbai and Bhusawal divisional headquarters. It falls within the district of Nashik and is 73 km away from the Nashik Road railway station. Jalgaon junction is 160 km from Manmad junction on the same route.

“The third railway track is vital for the Railways’ growth in the region as the Jalgaon-Manmad section, with just a pair of tracks, is an extremely busy line. A third track is being constructed , but the land acquisition process has been delayed because of the farmers’ opposition,” said a senior officials from the Jalgaon district collectorate.

The Railways has laid a third track between Bhusawal junction and Jalgaon junction. A fourth line is under construction. This construction needs to be finished soon to ease congestion. But in Jalgaon district, 93 farmers who own some 5.29 hectare between them, are not ready to part with their properties. Currently, there are 26 farmers with 2.46 hectare who are opposing the direct land purchase in the Jalgaon revenue sub-division. In the Pachora sub-division, there are 52 farmers with 2.47 hectare and in Chalisgaon, there are 15 farmers with 0.36 hectare, the official said. The farmers have been demanding the price of Rs 25 lakh per hectare. This is despite a pricing formula that was already decided by the district level committees.

“The farmers are not ready sell through the direct purchase method, which gives them certain additional incentives besides the rate that has been announced. This is by withdrawing the their rights to challenge the government decision in high court,” the official said. He said the government agencies will now renew talks with the farmers. If the talks fail, the administration will have no choice but opt for the compulsory land acquisition programme, in which the incentives will be withdrawn.

Meanwhile, Uttarakhand high court on Thursday ordered the personal appearance of the head of the Special Investigation Teams (SIT) probing the SC/ST scholarship scam.The HC also ordered private educational institutions that have been named to deposit Rs 50 lakh within two days after some of them expressed willingness to deposit the money that is alleged to have been siphoned off in the scam. The case will be heard next on March 4.

HYDERABAD: The National Population Register ( NPR ) and census training of district and mandal level officers has been stalled temporarily in some districts due to the ongoing Pattana Pragati programme. The training was supposed to be given to the officials between February 19 and March 15. However, the dates were clashing with the Pattana Pragati, that commenced on February 24.

“The two-day training programme involves an orientation for the officials who will be in charge of collecting the mandal and block level information for NPR and the census,” a highly placed official told TOI.

Though the training schedule did not mention a session on NPR, officials said that household listing operation of census invariably involves NPR. The household listing will be carried out along with NPR between April 1 to September.

Two-three officials from the municipality and revenue department will be in-charge of each mandal. The training for a supervisor will begin shortly after district officials’ training. All the officials will be taught data collection on mobile applications. Masters trainers for each district have been deployed.

tnn

Chandigarh: Five days after three girls were killed as a fire broke out at their PG accommodation in Sector 32, police arrested the house owner, Gaurav Aneja, from the city late on Wednesday night.

The PG accommodation operator, Nitesh Bansal, has already been arrested and is lodged in jail. The third accused, Nitesh Popli who operated the PG along with Bansal, is still at large.

“On a tip-off, Aneja, a resident of Sector 30, was arrested from Sector 32. He had given his house on rent to Bansal, who was running a PG facility there. We are on the lookout for Popli,” said a cop.

Aneja was produced before a court on Thursday that sent him to judicial custody.

Three students — Riya, 19, of Kapurthala, Prakshi Grover, 20, of Kotkapura, and Muskan, 21, of Hisar — were killed and two others injured after a fire tore through their PG facility on February 22. Riya was pursuing a course from Alliance Francaise in Sector 36. Muskan was an MCom student and Prakshi of BBA at SD College, Sector 32.

Their friends Jasmine and Femina were on the second floor when they heard cries for help. Realising they would be trapped, the two jumped from the balcony of the second floor into the backyard of the adjoining house to escape the blaze. Both had received injuries.

Four fire tenders had taken about one-and-a-half hours to douse the flames. The first floor was gutted.

Police said Muskan and Prakshi were found under a bed and Riya in a washroom. Riya and Prakshi had died of asphyxiation and Muskan was charred to death.

Police had booked the three — Aneja, Bansal and Popli — under sections 304 (punishment for culpable homicide not amounting to murder), 336 (act endangering life or personal safety of others), 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant), 34 (acts done by several persons in furtherance of common intention) of the IPC.

CHANDIGARH: Decks have finally been cleared for the Rs 160-crore pilot project of 24x7 water supply in Manimajra . It has been decided that Chandigarh Smart City Limited (CSCL) will do the entire capital work (initial task of setting up and starting the project) of this first-of-its-kind venture that will start at a cost of around Rs 70 crore.The municipal corporation will look after its operation and maintenance (O&M) for 15 years at a cost of around Rs 90 crore and collect the water bills. The selected company will be given 24 months to complete the capital works and hand it over to the authority concerned.The matter was also discussed during the MC monthly house meeting on Tuesday, where consent was accorded to the proposal for capital works by CSCL and operation and maintenance by the MC.During a detailed survey for the project, CSCL had found that at present Manimajra has 55% non-revenue water (NRW) of the total supplied potable water. This was either going in theft or wastage through internal leakages in pipelines. The survey has also gathered other details for initiating the project, like Manimajra has 13,700 connections of water supplied by the MC and a population of 1.4 lakh. The plan has been prepared with the future projection of 1.8 lakh population and to run it at least till 2051.NP Sharma, chief general manager of the CSCL, said, “The selected company will be given a target to bring this NRW from existing 55% to 15% in seven years in a phased manner by using the latest technology with regular monitoring of each house’s water consumption through technical surveillance and other methods. The tender document is ready to be put up before the technical committee of the smart city.

133,['28/02/2020'],Legend Roger Waters recites anti-CAA poem,"This story is from February 28, 2020

Roger Waters (AP photo)

NEW DELHI: A month after ‘Sab yaad rakha jayega’ (Everything will be remembered), a poem penned by Mumbai-based Aamir Aziz in protest against Citizenship (Amendment) Act went viral online, Pink Floyd co-founder and guitarist Roger Waters read out an English translation of it to protesters at a march in London. At a gathering that demanded release of jailed Wikileaks founder Julian Assange on February 22, Waters described Aziz as a “young poet and activist in Delhi” who is involved in a fight against “fascist, racist Citizenship law”. He added, “I think this kid’s got a future.”

Waters, who played the bass, and also wrote songs for the iconic band — two decades ago he staged one of the largest rock concerts in history, ‘The Wall - Live in Berlin’, with a reported attendance of 4,50,000 — said, “Julian is why we are here today, but this is no parochial protest. We are part of a global movement that might be the beginning of the global enlightenment, which this fragile planet so desperately needs.”

Pink Floyd’s ‘The Dark Side of the Moon’ (1973), ‘Wish You Were Here’ (1975), and ‘The Wall’ (1979) became massive hits worldwide. By the early 1980s, the band had become one of the most critically acclaimed and commercially successful groups of all time.

As news spread that Waters was caught on camera quoting Aziz, “Everything will be remembered. Kill us, we will become ghosts and write of your killings, with all the evidence...”, the 29-year-old said he was surprised at his own “popularity”.

Talking to TOI on Thursday, Aziz, an alumnus of Delhi-based Jamia Millia Islamia, said, “I am at a loss for words. I do not know how to react to this... It is a matter of pride and honour for me.”

Aziz said he felt compelled to write the lines because it was something “he felt strongly for”. The poem was written on January 11, a few days after the attack on Jawaharlal Nehru University students protesting against fee hike. He had also performed it at an anti-CAA protest in Hyderabad on the eve of Republic Day. The Patna-native told TOI that he plans to continue writing on love, life and social issues.

At least two of his poems talk about victims of mob lynchings in India. ‘Achche din blues’, released a few days before the 2019 Lok Sabha polls, which makes multiple references to demolition of Babri Masjid, also mentions two Muslim cattle traders killed in Jharkhand’s Latehar in 2016.

Another of his compositions, ‘Ballad of Pehlu Khan’, tells the tale of Khan, a dairy farmer from Haryana who was allegedly lynched by a mob of cow vigilantes in 2017 in Alwar. It reads: “Pehlu peshe se dairy kisan the, Bas khata itni si thi ki yahin paida huye, Aur, musalmaan the. (Pehlu was a dairy farmer. His only fault was he was born here. And that he was a Muslim).

After police crackdown on Jamia students on December 15, he wrote Jamia ki Ladkiyaan (The Women of Jamia) which spoke about women becoming the face of protests when police raised their sticks.

134,['28/02/2020'],‘Grand’ summit planned in April,"This story is from February 28, 2020

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: While saddled with the task of ensuring homes for the poor and surviving on loans worth over Rs 4,000 crore, LIFE Housing Mission is planning a mega housing summit this April in Kochi . The request for proposal (RFP), issued by LIFE mission, for selection of event management firm says ‘ Innovate build summit 2020 ’ is meant to transform the full spectrum of activities connected to housing construction through a national expo. It plans to engage event managers, with an average annual turnover of Rs 1 crore, a ‘grand, dynamic’ event complete with exhibition stalls, pavilions, multimedia halls, food courts, thematic conferences and workshops. The summit at Ernakulam collectorate is from April 24-26.

The summit will be held in an airconditioned expo area measuring 10,000 sq ft along with a non-AC conference area of same dimension. There will be an AC food area for VIPs (5,000 sq ft) and a normal food court spread across 5000 sq ft. RFP says that the event management firm must arrange travel and accommodation for delegates, organize luncheons, dinners along with speeches, plenary sessions, side events and workshops.

The summit is expected to attract 1,000 participants for the main conference in addition to the floating population for workshops, technical classes etc.

The pre-bid meeting of the event will be held on Friday and the timing and need for the event has raised eyebrows within LIFE mission. As per the RFP, only seven days has been given to the event management firm for submission of bid while it should be three weeks, said sources

The project cost is estimated at Rs 25 lakh, but given its scale, the amount is likely to exceed the estimate. While LIFE mission says the summit intends to identify disaster-resilient, innovative and sustainable alternative building materials and technology, Nirmithi Kendra and state housing board, line departments under housing departments, which are overseeing activities related to housing, are not in the picture.

Besides in March 2019, the Union ministry had organized an expo-cum-conference on construction technology as part of Global Housing Technology Challenge (GHTC). GoI undersecretary BK Mandal issued an office memorandum in 2019 which said that the challenge intends to involve all stakeholders including state governments. GHTC was launched as a platform to mainstream innovative and sustainable construction technologies in India’s affordable housing sector. LIFE mission had earlier invited project proposals from 16 alternative technology providers who were identified for GHTC for construction of LIFE towers.

LIFE mission CEO UV Jose said that the summit is planned to encourage cost-effective building solutions.

135,['28/02/2020'],HC upholds MAT order on senior medical officers’ salary,"This story is from February 28, 2020

Aurangabad: The Aurangabad bench of the Bombay high court recently upheld the order of the Maharashtra Administrative Tribunal (MAT) on ensuring parity in salaries of medical officers who were appointed before their junior medical officers, who, however, were getting increments more than the seniors.

P K Chavan and other 18 senior Class I medical officers had approached the MAT seeking directions for bringing their salaries on par with the juniors who were drawing higher salaries by a government resolution dated December 14, 2011.

Aggrieved by the MAT order, the state government approached the high court contending: “The Government Resolution, dated August 20, 2014, has been issued with an intention to benefit all the cadres and to overcome discrimination caused in their salaries.”

Lawyers Avinash Deshmukh and Shyam Patil, who represented the 19 medical officers, argued that “The present respondents (senior doctors) were promoted at an earlier point in time, but persons who were promoted/appointed after the introduction of the GR dated December 14, 2011, are drawing more salary. And that it is an elementary rule of service jurisprudence that a junior, similar in all respects, cannot be paid more salary than the senior. The tribunal has considered all the aspects of the matter and has rightly passed the order. The respondents were promoted in the Maharashtra Medical and Health Services Group-A (senior) prior to the introduction of the GR of December 2011.”

While dismissing the government petition on Februry, the bench comprising Justices S V Gangapurwala and Shrikant D Kulkarni observed: “It has been observed by the tribunal that the intent and purpose of the Government Resolution dated 20 August, 2014, was to remove the anomaly. The Government Resolution dated 20 August, 2014, was made applicable from the date of the Government Resolution and not with the retrospective effect. In view of that, the present respondents were not getting the benefit of Government Resolution dated 14.12.2011. For the interregnum period, i.e. between the Government Resolution dated 14.12.2011 and 14.12.2014, these respondents though seniors, were getting less salaries than their juniors. The very object and the purpose of bringing out the Government Resolution dated 20 August, 2014, was to do away with the disparity of the seniors getting less pay than their juniors. When the Government Resolution was to correct the mistake, then the same will have to be from the date, the disparity exist.”

While upholding the MAT decision, the HC observed: “The tribunal has rightly considered the said aspect. The view taken by the tribunal is a reasonable one. The interest of justice has been subserved by the order passed by the tribunal.”

HYDERABAD: The Telangana high court on Thursday asked the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation ( GHMC ) to explain the steps taken to clean various ponds in the city after Ganesh idols were immersed in them.A bench of Chief Justice Raghavendra Singh Chauhan and Justice A Abhishek Reddy issued notices to the state government and municipal authorities directing them to file counters by March 3. It was hearing a public interest petition which it took up on its own after coming across the plight of one such pond in Kukatpally .The hearing in the case would resume on March 5.GHMC, on its part, said 24 small ponds were set up in the city for devotees to immerse Ganesh idols during Ganesh Chaturthi. “What are you doing after these Ganesh and Bathukamma festivals are over? After these ponds are filled with idols and flowers, how are you cleaning them? How much time are you taking to do that?” the bench asked GHMC.GHMC counsel replied that they were cleaning the ponds first and in the second stage, ome species of fish were released into these ponds. “This is for cleansing the pond water,” he explained. The bench sought to know from him the progress of this new method after 2019 Ganesha and Bathukamma festivals. “Both were over by October. And its is three months now. Explain the progress you made till now,” the bench asked.To this, the counsel said that the commissioner had prepared a report and would file the same within a day or two. He sought some time to furnish a clear picture.As the main lakes of the city are getting damaged heavily on account of idol immersions, there was huge concern about the plight of the lakes and the ill-effects of the same on the city’s ecology. As a step towards curing this problem, GHMC had come up with the idea of digging smaller ponds near the main lakes or at alternative sites to encourage people to use these smaller ponds instead.One such smaller pond was dug up at Kukatpally and was lying neglected without cleaning.

137,['28/02/2020'],Lessons from Tasmania to Adyar poonga,"This story is from February 28, 2020

Adyar Poonga and ecologist Joss Brooks (inset)

CHENNAI: Community-based conservation centres play a major role when it comes to restoration of biodiversity, according to ecologist Joss Brooks , who has restored Pitchandikulam and Nadukuppam forest in Puducherry and Adyar Poonga in Chennai. Speaking on “Remembering the future garden” at MS Swaminathan Research Foundation on Thursday, Brooks said environmental education of villagers was necessary for restoration of biodiversity.

A lake restoration project that Brooks completed in Siruseri, according to him, could be replicated. “If what has been done in Siruseri is replicated several times, it will solve problems of Chennai,” he said, adding, the community, however, is the key to such initiatives. “Community members in respected areas need to monitor all activities closely. It is the community that should meet and decide how it would restrict buildings etc, not an outside authority; that is a sustainable model,” he said.

As an ecologist, Brooks has restored the Pitchandikulam forest in Auroville , which is today a mature forest, a community and education centre. In 2002, he embarked on environmental education of villages by setting up Nadukuppam Environment Education Centre in a village near Auroville. He also founded Pitchandikulam Forest Consultants, a business unit to provide environmental restoration services and is currently directing the restoration of biodiversity at Adyar Poonga in Chennai.

“I am an old gardener from Auroville,” said Brooks, pointing towards some community-driven initiatives which could restore what had already been there without introducing anything new. “A great example is how, in 2015, when Chennai was flooded, no water left the Auroville plateau. It was a sponge.” He also narrated how he restored water bodies in Adyar Poonga by removing huge piles of concrete debris.

Where did Brooks get the inspiration? Tasmania, he would say. He conducted many voyages using country boats along the Australian coast. “These travels helped me understand nature closely. I observed how its (Tasmania’s) indigenous people preserved nature by using traditional knowledge,” he said. However, it was the mass protest against the construction of Franklin Dam on the Gordon River in Tasmania in the early 1980s that made him think about nature seriously. The region had prehistoric caves which would be destroyed if the dam was constructed. “Campaigners used Australian photographer Peter Dombrovkis photograph of morning mist at Rock Island Bend of the Gordon River, which eventually brought down the Malcolm Fraser government in 1983,” he said. The dam was not constructed and the event stands testimony to one of the most powerful protests to preserve nature so far.

LUCKNOW: A day after he was arrested on charges of submitting forged documents along with his affidavit during 2017 assembly polls, the UP Vidhan Sabha notified election of SP leader Azam Khan ’s son Abdullah Azam as null and void on Thursday.

This is the third instance of an Assembly seat getting vacated. Earlier, elections of BJP MLA Kuldeep Singh Senger and Ashok Chandel were quashed by Vidhan Sabha following their convictions.

The notification said Vidhan Sabha has not received any suspension of the order. “The nullification of Abdullah Azam election from Suar assembly seat will be considered with effect from December 16,” the notification said. Sources said the Election Commission of India will soon be informed about the vacancy of the seat. Abdullah had found himself in the midst of the controversy for allegedly forging his birth certificate while filing his nomination in 2017.

According to an ACB official, the money was sought from the son of an elderly woman who was booked under section 420 of the Indian Penal Code by Kranti Chowk police. The policemen took the money on the premises of the police station for helping the woman secure bail.

According to BV Gavade, deputy superintendent of police, the complainant’s son had approached the suspect duo — Rameshlal Jaiswal and Gopal Sonwane — to help him in securing bail for his mother. The policemen offered to help, but demanded Rs15,000 for it.

The man then approached Jalna ACB and lodged a complaint against the cops. Following this, Jalna ACB — led by inspector Sangram Tathe — investigated the complaint and after ascertaining the facts laid a trap.

As soon as Jaiswal accepted the powdered currency notes from the complainant the ACB sleuths present there swooped arrested him. Subsequently, Sonwane was also arrested.

“An offence under the anti-corruption act has been registered against the duo,” the official said.

tnn

Chandigarh: Till the municipal corporation finds a new company with latest technology, no garbage would be deposited at the Dadumajra dumping site. Instead, the waste will be sent to the plant directly and processed.

Manoj Parida, adviser to the administrator, issued these directions to the civic body during a high-level meeting on Thursday. It was attended by home-cum-local bodies secretary, municipal commissioner, mayor, BJP’s city chief and other officers concerned. The adviser also asked the MC to inform him about the interim arrangements it plans to make in the absence of Jaypee Associate Company. The civic body will take over the Dadumajra garbage processing plant from Jaypee after a month.

Though modalities to run the plant are yet to be chalked out, sources said the municipal corporation would run it on its own till they find a new company. “The issue related to the employment of staff and technical expertise will be discussed during the preparation of the plan,” sources in the MC said.

“The key motive of the adviser was that no garbage should be dumped at Dadumajra ground at any cost, so he asked MC to adopt whatever plan it thought fit to process the garbage regularly,” an official said.

Since the National Green Tribunal is keeping an eye on the issue and had issued orders to implement solid waste management by March 31 (failing which MC will have to pay a penalty of Rs 10 lakh per month), the civic authority is left with no option, but to follow the directions.

Jaypee will be asked to vacate

While deciding to take over the garbage processing plant from Jaypee, the MC general house meeting, on Tuesday, planned to serve a notice on the company to vacate the premises within a week. It was also decided that if the company did not vacate the plant, MC will dismantle it and put the cost on it. Since the compost plant was recently installed, its current cost will be assessed and paid to the Jaypee.

141,['28/02/2020'],Dismissed UT cop acquitted in model rape case,"This story is from February 28, 2020

Chandigarh: The Chandigarh district court on Thursday acquitted dismissed UT police sub-inspector Naveen Kumar Phogat, who was alleged to have raped a 25-year-old model from Mumbai. He had been booked under sections 376 (rape) and 506 (criminal intimidation) of the IPC.

The court of additional district and sessions judge absolved Phogat of the charges, as the complainant turned hostile and failed to identify him in the court. The prosecution also failed to prove the charges against him.

The accused was suspended in August 2018 and transferred to the police lines after charges of corruption were levelled against him in a Bitcoin forgery case, and after this case was registered, he was dismissed from service.

A Mumbai-based model had alleged that she came in contact with the former SI in May 2018 in the course of investigation of a case being handled by him, who was then posted in the cyber cell of Chandigarh Police.

The model had come to the city to lodge a complaint of fraud committed on her on the pretext of getting her photoshoot done to help her enter the Punjabi film industry. On June 10, 2018, Phogat met the complainant, who had arrested a Dhanas man for fraudulently transferring Rs 12 lakh from her bank account. On June 12, the victim was with the accused for completing the documentation work. In the evening, he offered to drop her at her hotel in Industrial Area, Phase 2. After reaching the destination, he requested the model to let him use the washroom, to which she agreed.

The police claimed that the complainant alleged that after using the washroom, Phogat came out and claimed that he had various objectionable videos and pictures of her in his possession and threatened to circulate them in social media. He allegedly blackmailed the victim to get sexual favours from her. As per the complaint, the former SI also used force to overpower and rape her.

Advocate Rabindra Pandit, the counsel of accused, argued that his client is “innocent and falsely implicated” in the case. He stated that Phogat was a member of an SIT, constituted to investigate a Bitcoin case. This case involved some senior police officials, who in connivance with one other, implicated him in the case to save the accused in that case and also to save their own skin. It was stated that he was also falsely implicated in the rape case.

Also, during the arguments, the rape case complainant also turned hostile and failed to identify the accused. After hearing the arguments, the court acquitted him of all charges.

BOX

Dismissal challenged

Naveen Kumar Phogat has also challenged his dismissal in CAT by the police department, claiming it to be illegal and arbitrary. Phogat had joined the Chandigarh Police as an assistant sub-inspector (ASI) in October 2012 and since October 2015, he had been posted at cyber cell unit of the force and was promoted as an SI in 2017

Bhopal: Are you planning to go out on vacation with family, but worried that your locked house may be burgled?

Now, you don’t need to worry. Simply open the Bhopal city police website —bhopalpolice.com — and fill up the ‘Vacant House Information Form’, listed under the Citizen Services.

The details will be automatically forwarded to the police station in your area and the patrolling team will keep an eye on your house in your absence.

City police on Thursday officially launched the newly developed website in which over a dozen important ‘citizen services’, including ‘vacant house information form’ and ‘senior citizen care registration’, have been listed. Elderly persons residing alone in their houses can register themselves online by filling their details on the website which will be forwarded to the police station in their area. Cops will regularly visit their house and take care of their security concerns.

Other important services like ‘character verification’, ‘employee verification’, ‘tenant verification’ and ‘domestic help verification’ are also available on the website — eliminating the need to visit the police station.

Many services that are listed under the citizen services on the newly launched website were already available on the earlier launched MPeCop App of state police.

But they have been linked with the new website of city police to provide a single online platform for the convenience all sections of society.

One such service — ‘Atithi’ — is made available on the website under the citizen services in which hotel, guest house, and lodge owners cans fill in the details of people staying at their place to inform police. Other services, including vieweing FIRs, arrested person information and passport application status, have been linked to the website.

DIG Irshad Wali said that it is an ambitious initiative of Bhopal police and many services are being provided online for the first time. Issues may arise in the initial phase, but will soon be ironed out.

Police will make people aware about the citizen services available online to increase positive response. As the response increases, the database available with police will increase and then only police will be able to take the service delivery mechanism to the next level. The website will be updated on a regular basis.

143,['28/02/2020'],HC takes note of construction on riverbed in Andhari village,"This story is from February 28, 2020

SLUG: Grampanchayat Asked To Deposit Rs10L

Aurangabad: The Aurangabad bench of Bombay high court recently asked the Andhari grampanchayat in Sillod taluka to deposit Rs 10 lakh for going against the court’s stay order and carrying out construction activity in Bhodri river that led to causing serious threat and damage to the environment and ecology and to the public in general.

Vinod Baburao Tayde, a resident of Andhari village , had moved court seeking directions against the gram panchayat and its officials for “construction on the river bed, causing obstruction to the natural flow of water and leading a situation, whereby there is an apprehension to life and property of the residents of Andhari”.

On February 15, 2019, while taking cognizance of the petition, the court had directed the Aurangabad district collector as well as other respondents concerned to ensure that the unauthorized/illegal construction without permission of the competent authority should be stopped immediately, failing to which the authority/authorities concerned will be answerable to the court.

The matter again came up for hearing before the bench comprising justices Prasanna B Varale and R G Avachat on Monday when the bench asked the grampanchayat to deposit Rs 10 lakh with the court.

The bench observed: “Insofar as the act of grampanchayat, namely, initiation of construction on the river bed under the garb of enhancing revenue and permitting one of its employees to collect the amount of rent from the shop owners and then in turn, permitting amount to be deposited in the account of member of grampanchayat is concerned, this act is certainly not in the interest of residents of village Andhari, in particular, as this act causes serious threat and damage to the environment and ecology and to the public in general. As such, we are of the opinion that some corrective measure against grampanchayat is the need of the hour.’’

While referring to the tehsildar’s affidavit in reply, the court observed: “We could find certain shocking facts. The tehsildar admits that the complaint was already lodged with the Hon’ble Minister for Environment in respect of illegal construction carried out on the river bed.”

The bench also noted that “one employee of the grampanchayat, Kishor Namdeo Tayade, collected Rs 25,000 every shop owner and the total amount of Rs 23,75,000 (contribution) was deposited in the account of Dadarao Kisanrao Wankhede, member of the grampanchayat. An illegal entry is caused in Namuna No.11 and the amount of tax was collected from the encroachers. There is reiteration in paragraph-10 that construction of 34 shops would cause serious damage to the natural course of river and would cause irreparable loss to habitation and ecology”.

The court observed that the encroachers, nine members of the grampanchayat and its employees are responsible for encroachment in river bed. The court has posted the PIL for further consideration on March 9.

144,['28/02/2020'],Govt eyes income from state-owned property,"This story is from February 28, 2020

Bhopal: The cash-strapped Congress government in Madhya Pradesh plans to generate income from state-owned unused land and properties.

Chief secretary S R Mohanty has written to department heads to prepare detailed lists of properties in their possession or encroached upon, in dilapidated condition or left unused, so that income can be generated from them to meet department expenses. These details are to be submitted by March 10, said sources in Mantralaya.

The government is also exploring avenues of generating revenue from the spacious circuit houses and bungalows under PWD and irrigation department, apart from properties in other states.

“We have large circuit houses, rest houses and buildings in every district of Madhya Pradesh. We also have properties in other states that are lying unused, dilapidated or encroached by locals. Now, they will be utilised to generate income. We will auction some properties if necessary, rent out if possible, and offer public private participation (PPP) for use of the property to generate revenue or regular income,” PWD minister Sajjan Singh Verma told TOI.

During recent cabinet meetings, chief minister Kamal Nath has instructed department heads to maintain and utilise properties in their possession to generate income. “Properties owned by the state government should be utilised and income should be generated. All the departments must prepare an account of their assets and keep a record to monitor the utilisation of the properties. Action should also be taken against mafia that has encroached upon government property,” Nath had said during a review meeting of PWD.

The state also owns a huge land bank in possession of state roadways in Bhopal, Indore, Chhatarpur, Guna, Jabalpur, Gwalior, Seoni and Balaghat. There are properties and unused land in Mumbai, Nagpur, Jhansi and Agra which are either lying unattended or encroached upon. The government has prepared a list of its assets, some of which could be auctioned or rented out to big industry houses.

The finance department recently suggested to sell properties in possession of state roadways to clear dues of those who retired from state transport corporation, which was closed down due to financial crisis in May 2008. The revenue thus generated could be used to pay salaries, DA, retirement benefits and other dues. “Several properties in possession of the state government are lying unused as they could not be maintained. We will auction some of the expensive ones to generate revenue and settle dues of the department. We will prepare the plan within a week,” public relations minister PC Sharma told TOI.

The government will also renovate and provide some properties to other departments who sans buildings, land and other basic infrastructure for in-house purpose. The government has asked to prepare a detailed list of all such immovable assets, said the minister.

145,['28/02/2020'],Lessons from Tasmania to Adyar poonga,"This story is from February 28, 2020

Adyar Poonga and ecologist Joss Brooks (inset)

CHENNAI: Community-based conservation centres play a major role when it comes to restoration of biodiversity, according to ecologist Joss Brooks , who has restored Pitchandikulam and Nadukuppam forest in Puducherry and Adyar Poonga in Chennai. Speaking on “Remembering the future garden” at MS Swaminathan Research Foundation on Thursday, Brooks said environmental education of villagers was necessary for restoration of biodiversity.

A lake restoration project that Brooks completed in Siruseri, according to him, could be replicated. “If what has been done in Siruseri is replicated several times, it will solve problems of Chennai,” he said, adding, the community, however, is the key to such initiatives. “Community members in respected areas need to monitor all activities closely. It is the community that should meet and decide how it would restrict buildings etc, not an outside authority; that is a sustainable model,” he said.

As an ecologist, Brooks has restored the Pitchandikulam forest in Auroville , which is today a mature forest, a community and education centre. In 2002, he embarked on environmental education of villages by setting up Nadukuppam Environment Education Centre in a village near Auroville. He also founded Pitchandikulam Forest Consultants, a business unit to provide environmental restoration services and is currently directing the restoration of biodiversity at Adyar Poonga in Chennai.

“I am an old gardener from Auroville,” said Brooks, pointing towards some community-driven initiatives which could restore what had already been there without introducing anything new. “A great example is how, in 2015, when Chennai was flooded, no water left the Auroville plateau. It was a sponge.” He also narrated how he restored water bodies in Adyar Poonga by removing huge piles of concrete debris.

Where did Brooks get the inspiration? Tasmania, he would say. He conducted many voyages using country boats along the Australian coast. “These travels helped me understand nature closely. I observed how its (Tasmania’s) indigenous people preserved nature by using traditional knowledge,” he said. However, it was the mass protest against the construction of Franklin Dam on the Gordon River in Tasmania in the early 1980s that made him think about nature seriously. The region had prehistoric caves which would be destroyed if the dam was constructed. “Campaigners used Australian photographer Peter Dombrovkis photograph of morning mist at Rock Island Bend of the Gordon River, which eventually brought down the Malcolm Fraser government in 1983,” he said. The dam was not constructed and the event stands testimony to one of the most powerful protests to preserve nature so far.

Chief minister Kamal Nath at the state credit seminar 2020-21 organised by the NABARD in Bhopal on Thursday

Bhopal: Chief minister Kamal Nath on Thursday reiterated the state government's commitment to transform Madhya Pradesh into India's horticulture capital. Nath said that the credit potential estimated by the NABARD for the horticulture sector should be increased from 6 percent to at least 15 percent. NABARD has estimated the credit potential for Madhya Pradesh at Rs 1,98,786 crore. This is 13 percent more than that of last year's Rs 1,74,970 crore.

Releasing the state focus paper at the state credit seminar 2020-21 organised by the National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (NABARD) on Thursday, the CM said, ""Horticulture sector is a gateway to prosperity of farmers. This is the future of the farm sector. A large patch of unutilized revenue land in Madhya Pradesh can be utilized for expansion of horticulture activities.""

Stressing the need to approach the agriculture sector with a fresh vision and thinking, the chief minister said that the scenario is changing. ""Earlier, millets were out of focus, but today they have gained prominence. The millets were meant for consumption by the poor people. Now high nutritive value makes millet a popular food,"" he said.

Nath said NABARD has years of experience and intellectual capacity. ""NABARD will have to prepare plans for 2024-25. Today's scenario would change after five years. The goals set today can be achieved easily, but the challenge of achieving new targets must be accepted in future,"" he said, adding that ""NABARD has made an unprecedented contribution in Madhya Pradesh by playing an important role in building agricultural infrastructure. The knowledge that NABARD has acquired should be harnessed to expand its vision. He said that plans made for Madhya Pradesh can also be useful for the country.""

The chief minister said that the biggest challenge is unemployment among youth as they move from villages to cities. They have to be connected with emerging technologies and technical skills. He said that agriculture needs modernisation. He said NABARD should focus on export of crops and the emerging markets within the agriculture sector need to be closely monitored. ""NABARD should not use its expertise for routine jobs. It must pay attention to new farming techniques, besides giving a thought to construction of warehousing and procurement infrastructure. Apart from this, it should explore how new and useful infrastructures can be built. The role of NABARD was limited to re-financing, but today it has changed with the changing scenario,"" said Nath.

NABARD has made credit potential of Rs 1,98,786 crore for the year 2020-21. This is about 13 percent more than the previous year's 1,74,970 crore. In this, Rs 1,03,005 crore has been earmarked for agriculture loan, Rs 44,982 crore for term loan, about 32,001 crore for micro, small and medium entrepreneurs and Rs 18,797 crore for priority sectors like export credit, education, housing, renewable energy and other social infrastructure.

Chief general manager of NABARD, SK Bansal, urged banks to play a key role in achieving the targets. He stressed the need to increase Kisan Credit Card (KCC) coverage to 100% farmers, invest in rural infrastructure and strive for financing agricultural producer groups. He also discussed the benefits of loan worth Rs 26,000 crore offered to the state under the Rural Infrastructure Development Fund (RIDF) and the Long Term Seed Fund (LTIF).

Giving information about e-Shakti project for self-help groups in 21 districts, Bansal said that this will benefit about 2.5 lakh families of 25000 groups. The chief minister also felicitated farmers' producer organisations for their outstanding performance.

Nashik: The Maharashtra State Road Transport Corporation (MSRTC) has started training women as drivers for its fleet in Nashik Region – comprising Nashik, Dhule, Jalgaon, Ahmednagar districts and Aurgangabad region, combined.

There are 11 women from Nashik and another 11 women from Dhule depot of Nashik region. In addition, 10 women from Aurangabad region are being trained, the MSRTC officials at Aurangabad confirmed. The training is being conducted at the Traffic Inspector Training Centre in Aurangabad.

“The women will be trained for one year. Thereafter, they will have to appear for an examination. If qualified, they will be inducted in the service,” Anant Pawar, driver trainer at the centre, said.

This is the first time that the women are being trained by the MSRTC at its own facility in Aurangabad region. A total of 163 women, married and single, are being trained by the MSRTC at Yavatmal, Pune, Amravati regions besides Aurangabad.

Since the posts for drivers were reserved for women, the MSRTC was trying to fill them up. The transport utility started recruiting women as conductors about five years back.

“The major hitch was that MSRTC was unable to get women drivers despite flashing advertisements as the key condition was that the applicants should have three years experience in driving heavy vehicles,” the MSRTC official said.

The official said that it was very difficult to find women who had driving heavy vehicles, normally trucks. The transport utility then tweaked conditions to absorb women in the service by providing training as well.

The women applicants, who already have light motor vehicle licence and have applied for heavy motor vehicle licence, were selected for the training.

They will get one year training to drive the buses. This will be followed by a computerized driving test. Those clearing the test will get further induction training of one month before starting the job.

The MSRTC official added that the women will first be asked to join the local depot before being given a long-distance duty. “It will be a confidence-building measure for these women. As they gain confidence in their driving skills, the longer duties can be assigned to them,” the officer said.

149,['28/02/2020'],Azam Khan : 'Op Azam' brings back memories of Pota Act against Raja Bhaiya,"Azam Khan (left) & Raghuraj Pratap Singh aka Raja Bhaiya

LUCKNOW: The way the Yogi Adityanath government has brought the powerful SP leader Azam Khan to his knees has few parallels in UP’s political history. The Rampur MP was not only declared a land mafia, but also a goat thief.He has also been hounded by income tax and enforcement directorate sleuths for financial transactions linked to his Jauhar University, though he, along with wife and son, were sent in judicial custody for alleged forgery in the birth certificate of his son Abdullah Azam which he submitted while filing papers for 2017 assembly poll.Political observers say that closest example of such a subjugation is the taming of firebrand Thakur neta Raghuraj Pratap Singh alias Raja Bhaiya during the BSP government in 2002 when Mayawati was the chief minister. Raja Bhaiya had not only been booked under draconian Prevention of Terrorist Activities (Pota) law but also slapped with charges like stealing of utensils and murder.Azam is a founder member of SP and his stature could be gauged from the fact that just when he landed at Sitapur jail the party chief Akhilesh Yadav rushed to see him. Earlier, SP founder Mulayam Singh Yadav, addressed a press conference after long when the BJP government lodged over 80 criminal cases against the Rampur MP.Earlier also, Azam has been showing his authority and importance by using pressure tactics. Often, his tantrums have embarrassed the party leadership. Be it his constant absence from party meetings, including national executives, and his insistence on not keeping any principal secretary in his urban development department when he was a minister, Azam has been in news for wrong reasons in the past. Once when he didn’t go to Agra for the party’s summit, Akhilesh went all the way to his house cajole him. The secretariat staff didn’t show any such reverence and they went on strike when Azam allegedly misbehaved with his personal assistant.He had frequent run-ins with governor as well. During the SP regime between 2003 and 2007, he described then governor TV Rajeswar as ‘darban of Sonia Gandhi” (attendant of the Sonia Gandhi). Rajeswar was insistent on sacking him, but then CM Mulayam Singh Yadav saved him by apologising to the governor.During the 2012-17 SP regime, he again invited the wrath governor Ram Naik when he allegedly used disparaging remarks against him during his speech in the assembly. An enraged Naik sought Azam’s unedited speech and asked CM Akhilesh Yadav to take action against him. Akhilesh, too, expressed regret.During 2014 LS poll, Azam also earned Election Commission’s censure when he said during campaign that only Muslim jawans fought and won Kargil for India. It saw a counter-polarisation against the SP and it was reduced to just five seats.During 2019 general elections, he again hogged the limelight by declaring that the Rampur DM (who was pursuing cases against him) would be made to clean his shoes when the SP came to power. He has been accused of forcefully acquiring land during SP regime for the construction of Jauhar University, which has led to 80 FIRs.Slapping of so many criminal cases against Azam has brought back memories of Raja Bhaiya’s plight during Mayawati’s regime. While Azam’s Jauhar University is facing demolition (HC has just ordered an stay), the BSP government had bulldozed Raja Bhaiya’s riverside sanctuary in his native place Kunda in Pratapgarh. Besides, his palace, Bhadri House, had been turned into an impromptu camp for para military forces.While by nailing a feudal Thakur leader, Mayawati wanted to send a message that socio-political dynamics was changing, by taming Azam Khan, Yogi wants to give a larger political message. “The more Akhilesh would defend Azam , the more Yogi would brand him a pro-Muslim in the run-up to 2022 polls,” said an analyst.In Video: UP: Azam Khan shifted to Sitapur jail with wife and son",lucknow,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74362659,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-513414,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/azam-taming-akin-to-maya-pota-bomb-on-raja-bhaiya/articleshow/74349176.cms

151,['28/02/2020'],SRTMU rolls back change in exam schedule,"This story is from February 28, 2020

Aurangabad: The Nanded-based Swami Ramanand Teerth Marathwada University ( SRTMU ) on Thursday decided to roll back permanent change in the schedule of examinations as per which students were made to appear for two papers on a single day.

The decision came a day after state higher education minister Uday Samant took cognizance of the complaints from the students and invited SRTMU vice-chancellor (VC) Udhav Bhosle to discuss the issue.

Bhosle on Thursday had said the change in schedule was aimed at saving the overall time spent in conducting examinations, but the decision would be revoked from the next examination.

“Almost 45 days are spent every semester for conducting examinations alone. The idea was to curtail this period and utilize the time saved for academic purposes. The change concerned, however, did not go well with a section of students and therefore it will not be in place onwards,” he said.

The VC said that the contentious change in the examination schedule was implemented after following all due procedures and nobody took the objection at any stage. “The change in examination schedule was announced only after it received necessary clearance from the Academic Council and Board of Examinations, among other competent bodies. The proposal was also discussed with college principals separately, who too had given their consents,” Bhosle said.

The change in the examination schedule had received sharp reactions from students, who dubbed the move as regressive. Meanwhile, a section of students has demanded re-conducting of last semester examination, claiming that they suffered academic loss as two papers were held on a single day.

Established at Nanded by bi-furcating the Marathwada University, Aurangabad on September 17 1994, the SRTMU has over 300 affiliated colleges with jurisdiction over half of Marathwada, including Nanded, Hingoli, Latur and Parbhani districts.

152,['28/02/2020'],CBI relook at Laxmikant Sharma in Vyapam case,"This story is from February 28, 2020

Bhopal: CBI is considering taking a fresh look into the case of former BJP minister Laxmikant Sharma, who the central agency had removed from the list of accused in the 2012 transport constable recruitment scam of Vyapam for ‘lack of evidence’.

Though CBI officials refused to comment, insiders say the decision to reopen the Sharma files comes in backdrop of a viral ‘honeytrap’ video clip, which has “Vyapam-related conversations”.

The 2012-transport constable recruitment scam was considered the most important of all Vyapam-related cases due to allegations against some top leaders of BJP, which was then in power, and the so-called ‘Gondia’ connection — a reference to a Maharashtra district.

While CBI had submitted the chargesheet of this case in 2019 against 26 people, it did not find anything significant in allegations that candidates from Gondia district of Maharashtra were selected under political influence. Nineteen of those chargesheeted are candidates. The others include former Vyapam officials, middlemen and impersonators. Two of the accused died during investigations.

CBI had registered the FIR on July 22, 2015, naming Laxmikant Sharma, former higher education minister, his close aide Om Prakash Shukla, and several others. This Vyapam case turned sensational after Congress alleged in 2014 that over a dozen candidates, who had cleared the written exam were from Gondia and that they were recruited by the transport department following “directions from CM house”.

“Some allegations mentioned in various complaints, pertaining to illegal enhancement of number of posts of transport constables, irregularities in selection of candidates for the post of transport constables from the merit and waiting lists, and allegations related to illegal selection of candidates from Gondia district of Maharashtra under political influence, were also investigated, which did not reveal any illegality, irregularity or commission of any offence,” the chargesheet says. CBI said it is still awaiting reports from CFSL Hyderabad on some digital files.

Sources in the agency said that Sharma may be made an accused in the case if opinion of legal experts points to the possibility. Sharma has always rejected the allegations.

File photo of students visiting ‘Bada Bagh Baoli’ in Bhopal

Bhopal: The Gujarat model of heritage preservation could form the genesis for preservation of heritage buildings in Bhopal city, said convener of Bhopal Citizens’ Forum, Prakash Seth.

The forum is demanding urgent measures to save heritage in the state capital.

In a letter to the MP state chief secretary, the forum pointed out that an outstanding characteristic of the state capital is its rich heritage, which is a matter of pride for the city’s residents and a big attraction for outsiders.

However, most of the heritage structures are located in the old city area and were constructed during the rule of the Orakzai Pathans who held sway over this area from 1707 to 1949. “They represent a priceless heritage and deserve conservation,” said Seth.

The first step to be taken in this direction would be documentation of precincts that require preservation. Only a handful of buildings have been notified as heritage and protected. Seth cited the forum’s letters to the state government in 2010 and 2015, seeking action for protection of the monuments.

Elaborating on the Gujarat model of heritage preservation, he said necessary revision has been effectuated in the development plan of the Ahmedabad Urban Development Authority for preservation of heritage buildings.

Rules have been framed, and under them, structures and precincts are listed as heritage properties. The Competent Authority there acts on the advice of the Heritage Preservation Committee.

NEW DELHI: All eyes were on court number-38 in Delhi high court on Thursday after the news of Justice S Muralidhar’s transfer to Punjab and Haryana high court spread.

However, instead of the judge holding routine hearings on the division bench that includes justice Talwant Singh, he came out to only pronounce a judgment relating to commercial activities being carried out from residential areas. “This is my last judicial act as a judge of Delhi high court,” Justice S Muralidhar said after which his bench didn’t assemble.

A large section of lawyers, including senior advocates, had gathered inside the courtroom to thank Justice Muralidhar. One of them said: “You are an inspiration to many” as they wished him the best on his future assignment.

The staff had already communicated to the lawyers, who had matters listed before his bench, that the judge won’t preside after pronouncement of the verdict.

Hours after a bench headed by him had slammed Delhi Police for failing to register FIRs in cases of alleged hate speeches by three BJP leaders — Anurag Thakur, Parvesh Verma and Kapil Mishra, the Centre cleared February 12 transfer recommendation for justice Muralidhar made by the Supreme Court collegium.

Justice Muralidhar is the third senior most judge in Delhi high court after Chief Justice D N Patel and Justice G S Sistani, and had to step in Tuesday night in the other two’s absence. He had conducted an urgent and unprecedented midnight hearing at his residence to issue immediate directions ensuring safe passage for victims holed up in a hospital under siege in northeast Delhi where rioters held sway.

On Wednesday, the bench of justices Muralidhar and Talwant Singh had heard a plea seeking lodging of FIRs and arrests for hate speech by BJP functionaries over Citizenship (Amendment) Act. It had passed strong comments making it clear that the HC won’t allow “another 1984 in the city...”

The court was hearing a public interest litigation petition filed by Gottimukkala VRRG Raju of Saroornagar, Hyderabad, who charged the authorities with failing to take action on the commercial complex in Adilabad. The plot where this building was coming up was actually allotted to Munnur Kapu Sangham for raising a hostel building for the community students.According to the petitioner, the plot was allotted to the sangham way back in 1975. Instead of raising a hostel, president of the sangham began raising a structure which was meant to be used as a commercial complex. The petitioner contended that this defeated the purpose for which the plot was allotted.The standing counsel for the municipality informed the bench that the incomplete structure had been lying at the spot for the last five years and that is why the municipal officials did not take any action.At this, the CJ asked: “Are the municipal officials waiting for the structure to be completed?”The bench said, “If you (officials) come to a conclusion that the structure is illegal, you have to act on it.” The standing counsel tried to convince the bench that there was no finding that the structure was illegal and that he was only stating that it was in an incomplete form.The bench did not accept this and issued notices.

NEW DELHI: In a major rescue exercise, India on Thursday evacuated 195 nationals, who were seeking to escape the coronavirus outbreak , from Japan and China. While 119 people were evacuated from cruise ship Diamond Princess in Japan, 76 more were brought back from Wuhan in China by a relief military aircraft.Significantly, India also evacuated 36 foreign nationals from Wuhan and five from Japan. “The evacuation has underscored the priority India attaches to the welfare of its citizens wherever they are,” foreign secretary Harsh Shringla said. He added that India was “happy to have been able to assist our friends from Bangladesh, Myanmar, Maldives and other friendly countries from our neighbourhood and beyond in the evacuations from both China and Japan”.Of the 36 foreign nationals evacuated from Wuhan, 23 were from Bangladesh, six from China, two each from Myanmar and Maldives and one each from South Africa, US and Madagascar. Of the five from Japan, there were two from Sri Lanka and one each from Nepal, South Africa and Peru.The Indian relief flight to Wuhan carried 15,000 kg of medical assistance comprising masks, gloves and other emergency medical equipment. These supplies were delivered by an IAF C-17 special flight which landed in Wuhan late on Wednesday evening.The medical supplies followed PM Narendra Modi’s letter to President Xi Jinping offering assistance to deal with the crisis. “The medical supplies will help augment the China’s efforts to control the outbreak of this infection which has been declared as a public health emergency by the World Health Organisation,’’ the MEA said in a statement.Some of India’s neighbours like Bangladesh and Sri Lanka had sought help from India to evacuate their citizens. The government said assistance to them was in keeping with India’s neighbourhood first policy. India has until now operated three relief flights from Wuhan, evacuating 723 Indian nationals and 43 foreign nationals.In the case of Japan, a special Air India flight landed in New Delhi from Tokyo on Thursday, bringing back 119 Indian nationals (113 crew members and six passengers) who were on board the Diamond Princess which docked off Yokohama in Japan.“In line with India’s neighbourhood first policy and Indo-Pacific vision, the special flight also evacuated five foreign nationals — two Sri Lankans, one Nepalese, one South African and one Peruvian. All the evacuees will undergo a 14-day quarantine at the facility set up by the Indian Army in Manesar, Haryana,’’ the MEA said.Three Indian crew members didn't board the special flight and conveyed their wish, according to the government, to continue their stay on board the cruise ship to complete the period of extended quarantine put in place by the Japan government.“Out of the total 138 Indian nationals originally on board the Diamond Princess, 16 Indian crew members have tested positive for coronavirus 2019 and are receiving necessary medical care and treatment at onshore medical facilities in Japan. Embassy of India in Tokyo has established contact with these individuals and is continuously following-up on their recovery,’’ the foreign ministry said.The ship was put under quarantine by Japan on February 5 for 14 days as one of the passengers who had disembarked from the ship had tested positive for COVID-19.

AMARAVATI: The controversial nuclear power plant in Kovvada of Srikakulam is likely to be revived as the issue came up for discussion between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and US President Donald Trump during the latter’s just concluded trip to India.The joint statement released by the White House said both Trump and Modi have decided to encourage the firms - Westinghouse and Nuclear Power Corporation of India Limited (NPCIL) - involved in the construction of the 7248 MW atomic energy plant to complete it early.Although the statement did not mention Kovvada plant in Andhra Pradesh , its reference to the joint venture of Westinghouse and NPCIL clearly indicates the plans to revive the project in coastal AP as it is the only project taken up by Westinghouse in India.The statement said: “President Trump and Prime Minister Modi welcomed growing links between the United States and India in trade and investment in hydrocarbons. Through their Strategic Energy Partnership, the United States and India are seeking to enhance energy security, expand energy and innovation linkages across respective energy sectors, bolster strategic alignment, and facilitate increased engagement between industry and other stakeholders. President Trump and Prime Minister Modi noted the potential for the United States to meet India’s goal to diversify its import base for coking/metallurgical coal and natural gas, welcoming recent commercial arrangements intended to accelerate access to LNG in the Indian market.“President Trump and Prime Minister Modi encouraged the Nuclear Power Corporation of India Limited and Westinghouse Electric Company to finalize the techno-commercial offer for the construction of six nuclear reactors in India at the earliest date,” it said.The Kovvada project has been mired controversies right from its proposal stage about a decade ago. Fishermen and farmers off Kovvada area strongly resisted land acquisition plans by the state government and brought the works to a grinding halt. The government could take over just around 450 acres against the requirement of over 2000 acres for the plant.The locals heaved a sigh of relief when the project proponent Westinghouse went through bankruptcy proceedings and faced near shutdown in 2017. However, Westinghouse was back in action following the takeover by Brookfields Business Partners (BBP) in 2018.Human Rights Forum (HRF) general secretary VS Krishna strongly condemned the attempts to pump life back into the nuclear plant along AP coast. He said that setting up of nuclear plants is a crime against future generations.

Bhopal: The Union Carbide India Ltd (UCIL) counsel said in a Bhopal court on Thursday that CBI has failed to establish UCIL’s criminal liability in the gas disaster.

The court of district & sessions judge is hearing appeal filed by all the convicts in the gas disaster criminal case against their conviction for criminal negligence. They were awarded two years’ suspended sentence by the trial court of chief judicial magistrate (CJM) on June 7, 2010.

In arguments that lasted over five hours, UCIL counsel Amit Desai said CBI contends that MIC gas escaped from tank- E 610- due to water washing of the pipes in the plant and some water getting into the tank in the process but it did not name or charge-sheet those who ordered it or carried out water washing. How is UCIL responsible for an act by some persons at a local unit, he said.

Quoting from several court judgments in India and abroad, he said that question of corporate liability of UCIL for the disaster does not arise as CBI has failed to produce any evidence that UCIL was responsible for the disaster. The lawyer said the CBI chargesheet was based on inferences derived from a scientific report on the gas disaster, which does not prove the charge of criminal negligence on the part of UCIL.

Despite an earlier order of district judge Rajendra Verma for appearance of all convicts in the case, only S P Roychoudhary attended the proceedings on Thursday. When the judge asked about the other convicts, standing counsel for the convicts urged the court not to press for their personal presence “unless and until necessary”, as they are frail and old and not in a position to come to court on each hearing.

167,['28/02/2020'],Experts seek proper water arrangements in wildlife sanctuaries,"This story is from February 28, 2020

Aurangabad: With warmer months around the corner, city-based environmentalist and nature lovers have demanded supply of adequate water in waterholes of all the wildlife sanctuaries in Marathwada .

According to experts, dearth of water, besides posing survival issue for different creatures during summer, can increase cases of man-animal conflict in forest areas.

Environmentalist Kishor Pathak said the forest department must take proactive steps to ensure that all waterholes in wildlife sanctuaries have sufficient water throughout the summer.

“Summer invariably brings scarcity of water in sanctuaries as natural waterbodies dry out. The dearth of water makes wild animals and other creatures prone to heat-stroke if no water is available. At times, deaths of creatures due to lack of water during summer have went unnoticed,” he said.

Marathwada region has Gautala-Autramghat wildlife sanctuary spread over Aurangabad and Jalgaon districts, Yedshi Ramling Ghat wildlife sanctuary in Osmanabad district, Naigaon Peacock sanctuary in Beed district and Painganga wildlife sanctuary in Yavatmal, among other major reserved forest areas.

Animal rescue expert Nitesh Jadhav said unavailability of water within the wildlife sanctuaries poses a potential threat to the food chain and in turn leads to man-animal conflict.

“The food chain refers to a sequence of transfer of food from one creature to another and is the link with which creatures are related to each other by the way of food they eat. Unavailability of water during summer breaks this food chain forcing animals to stray into human habitats in search of food and water,” he said.

When contacted, chief conservator of forests (territorial) PK Mahajan said instructions have been issued to ensure availability of water in all waterholes located in all sanctuaries of the region.

“Besides supplying water, we have also appealed to the locals to pitch in for quenching the thirst of wildlife creatures during summer. The region has sufficient number of waterholes in different sanctuaries which will be filled on a regular basis till the arrival of monsoon,” he said.

HYDERABAD: Water stagnation, garbage accumulation and proliferation of hawkers were some of the concerns raised by shopowners of Laad Bazaar at a workshop organised by Unesco, Republic of Korea Funds-in-Trust project and Intach on Thursday.Srikanth, who owns a bangle shop in Laad Bazaar, said that while the pedestrianisation project was a good move, execution was not perfect. “Stones that were laid on walkways are not levelled. This makes it difficult for customers, especially elderly people, to walk through the bylanes.” Citing an example of how a senior citizen recently suffered a hairline fracture, he suggested that battery carts can be introduced for them.The workshop is part of Unesco’s efforts to make citizens stakeholders in their city’s heritage.Water stagnation was another subject that several shopkeepers touched upon. Tayub Abu Baker, owner of AH Zariwala, said, “There is no proper drainage from Charminar to Moti Gali and water stagnates every time it rains.” Stating that focus on the development of the western corridor of the city was robbing the Old City of its value, Abu Baker requested that Laad Bazaar’s unique identity be promoted and preserved.Besides newer commercial hubs, Husain Ramzani, a fourth-generation shopowner who deals in traditional wedding material, said hawkers have moved to the bylanes snatching business of stores.Highlighting the issue of hygiene, Ramzani added, “This market has a history. It attracts lakhs of tourists and customers every year, yet it is filthy.” He says while dustbins have been placed right outside his shop, people seldom use them, spitting and discarding water wherever they wish.While welcoming the pedestrianisation of Charminar area, Intach Hyderabad convenor Anuradha Reddy said, “The changes over the years have not taken into account the heritage value of the surroundings of Charminar. It is being done without taking into account heritage, cultural and social impact assessments. The lack of coordination among different agencies that manage the heritage site have led to some of the problems of Laad Bazaar and other shopping areas.”Prof Ramana Reddy, also an Intach member, said, “Modern technology must be used to showcase Laad Bazaar’s uniqueness, which cannot be found in malls. The government and occupants of the bazaar must work together to protect this historic market.”",hyderabad,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74384394,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-293787,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/pedestrianisation-a-failure-laad-bazaar-shopowners/articleshow/74346368.cms

Raghav Chadha

NEW DELHI: Rajendra Nagar MLA Raghav Chadha has been appointed as the new vice-chairman of Delhi Jal Board. Burari MLA Sanjeev Jha and Deoli MLA Prakash Jarwal have been appointed as members of the board of the agency, which is responsible for supplying potable water to almost 97% of Delhi.

The Delhi assembly issued a notification in this regard late on Wednesday.

A first-time MLA, Chadha has replaced Sangam Vihar legislator Dinesh Mohaniya, who held the position in the previous term of the Aam Aadmi Party government.

The appointment of Chadha as the new vice-chairman of Delhi Jal Board came days after chief minister Arvind Kejriwal handed over the responsibility of the body to urban development minister Satyendar Jain. Kejriwal was the chairman of DJB in AAP government’s previous term. Jain has been appointed as DJB chairman this time.

The restructuring of the political wing of Jal Board is being seen as an important step by the government to provide piped water to every household in the next five years. In its 10-point guarantee card released ahead of the recently concluded Delhi assembly polls, AAP has promised to provide 24-hour clean piped water to every household in this term.

Thiruvananthapuram: Union government is solely responsible for the riots in Delhi, said CPI state secretary Kanam Rajendran . “The attacks in Delhi were pre-planned. The immediate provocation was the rooting out of BJP in New Delhi assembly polls,” Rajendran said while inaugurating a protest gathering organized by CPI in front of Secretariat on Thursday.

“Our Prime Minister took several hours to make any comment despite the riots going on for three days. Goons who had come from Uttar Pradesh ran riot in Delhi. Sangh Parivar is applying dangerous tactics to divide people. All the while the police remained mute spectators,” Rajendran said. The CPI secretary also asked all who are concerned about the future of the country to stay united and resist the Sangh Parivar agenda.

CPI district secretary G R Anil presided over the event. Deputy speaker V Sasi, MLA C Divakaran, state assistant secretary K Prakash Babu and district assistant secretary Mankode Radhakrishnan spoke.

SP chief Akhilesh Yadav steps out of Sitapur jail after meeting Azam Khan on Thursday (PTI Photo)

LUCKNOW: Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav , who rushed to Sitapur on Thursday morning to meet the jailed party MP Azam Khan , hit out at the BJP, accusing it of targeting senior party leaders with political vendetta.

Speaking to reporters in Sitapur, Akhilesh said Azam was being targeted ever since BJP came to power in UP. Azam is facing more than 80 criminal cases, including offences like cattle theft, jewellery theft and goat theft.

“Azam Khan and his family is in jail because of political conspiracy of the BJP. But in politics, such an act if vendetta cannot be considered ethical. However, you cannot expect anything more from BJP. Ever since it came to power, Azam is being implicated in false cases. Azam sahib expressed faith in the law which will help him in coming days,” the SP chief said. He also said that Azam’s wife Tanzeen Fatima is unwell while his son has an injury in his hands.

Hailing Azam’s Mohammed Ali Jauhar University as a center of learning, Akhilesh slammed BJP for not doing enough to educate people and instead conspiring to fan communal hatred. He categorically charged the saffron party of resorting to politics of fear and hatred amongst religious communities. He said that the BJP used to claim that no riots can take place under its regime. “But what has happened,” he questioned, adding: “BJP dange karakar rajniti karti hai, kyuki dange honge to unse (BJP leaders) investment ke bare main, development ke bare main koi nahi poochega…nafrat failana dange karana yahi Gujarat model hai,” he said, while referring to Delhi riots.

“Despite the visit by US president Donald Trump, the BJP could not ensure enough security in Delhi which was hit by violence,” he said.

Reacting to protests against amended Citizenship law Akhilesh said the law has ended the recognition of the country. Quoting Swami Vivekananda, Akhilesh said the country did not need religion but employment that could feed its people. “But the BJP appears to have forgotten Swami Vivekananda’s preaching,” he said.

MP sports department has installed a Jacuzzi at Tatya Tope Stadium

BHOPAL: To help players recuperate fast after injury and also to enhance their performance , the MP sports department has installed a Jacuzzi at Tatya Tope Stadium .

Several modern techniques have been developed to improve players’ performance. Hydrotherapy (Jacuzzi or hot water tub) is one such technique. Video analysis and acupuncture have also been deployed to enhance performance and fast recovery of players after injuries.

Hydrotherapy involves the use of water to treat various injuries or ailments. Although it resembles swimming, it is different because it requires the individual to undertake different exercises in a warm pool of water.

Experts said that soaking in a hot water before and after workout can help loosen up muscles. This will make it easier to exercise and reduce chances of suffering an injury. Depending on the sport or activity, using the Jacuzzi before exercising can help improve performance. When muscles are loose and ready, agility and speed can increase.

Head of the sport science centre at Tatya Tope Stadium, Dr Jince Thomas Mathew, said hydrotherapy has become very important for players. “Muscle soreness and stiffness are the very common complaints among athletes. They experience the most after exercise or injury. Warm water therapy or jacuzzi helps blood vessels expand. It helps increase blood flow to the muscles and skin. Consequently, it helps prevent complaints of soreness and stiffness,” said Dr Thomas.

He added that benefits of Jacuzzi complement most fitness routines and also help relieve pain, stress, and tension in more than one ways. Modern-day hot tubs and Jacuzzis are not just confined to usage with hot water as one can also pour cold water into them and use them to cool off after workout if it is needed.

Director sports (in-charge), Vinod Pradhan, said that correction in technique during training plays an important role.

“We have started video recording the training sessions, which are analysed by the coach with the players so that his or her wrong approach could be detected and resolved,” said Pradhan. The department has also hired an acupuncture specialist. “After getting exhausted in matches and training sessions, an acupuncture specialist helps the players relax in a better way,” Pradhan added.

The sports department is running around 18 academies for different sports.

Nashik: The Cantonment Board Deolali's (CBD) proposed shopping complex project has hit a roadblock after it received a lukewarm response from prospective buyers of shopping space.

The CBD has now decided to ease some of the stringent terms and conditions for those looking to purchase outlets.

The cantonment board had hoped to set up the state-of-the-art shopping complex on its 2,161 square metres of land at Howson Road. A tender was floated seeking buyers the board hoped would buy space in advance.

Currently, Levitt market — the cantonment's main commercial zone — has over 80 shops. Residents largely rely on this market for everything from vegetables to jeans.

“The board is thinking of relaxing and reframing some of the terms and conditions of the shopping complex project,"" said Ajay Kumar, the chief executive officer of the CBD. ""This easing of norms will make buying space easier.""

Members of the CBD are set to hold a discussion on the matter during the next board meeting.

Vice president of the board, Bhagwan Katariya, said buyers will need not pay the entire amount for buying the outlets in advance.

“They have to pay the total in installments. This will allow the board to start construction work of the complex,"" Katariya said. “I am now optimistic there will be good response from prospective buyers once the norms are relaxed,"" he added.

Board members said a contract to build the complex will be appointed after it receives some advance payments from the buyers.

In total, the complex will have 92 shops spread over two floors. The ground floor will have 50 shops and a restaurant; the first floor will have a bank and 40 shops.

Shops on the ground floor will cost buyers Rs 20 per sqft. Space on the first floor is being sold for Rs 15 per sqft.

Aurangabad: Charted Accountants (CAs) are in demand in every sector and pursuing CA studies offer good job opportunities at par with the IT field, said Ganesh Shilwant, new president of the Aurangabad branch of Western Indian Regional Council (WIRC) of Institute of Chartered accountants of India (ICAI).

“Many students and parents are unaware of career opportunities as CA. The profession has been witnessing an increasing role in the service sector as well as the manufacturing sector among other fields. Therefore, CA studies should be considered as one of the preferred career options,” he said.

Shilwant said that CAs have a lot of job opportunities in the country as well as in abroad. “The accounting system by and large remains the same across the globe. CAs are responsible for accountancy, audits, financial planning and fund management among other tasks. The talented professionals have job opportunities not only in India but also overseas,” he said.

Sharing his vision during his term for 2020-21, the newly elected chairman of ICAI said that he would lay focus on continuous upgradation of knowledge of students and members.

“Increasing the passing percentage is also one of the focus areas. At around 10% to 11%, the success rate of Aurangabad chapter is higher as compared to the national average, but we still want to increase it further by few digits,” Shilwant said.

A video where the students of the all-girls college took the ‘no love marriage’ pledge had gone viral and drew sharp reactions from across the socio-political spectrum.

A day after the incident, college principal Dr Haware had issued an apology and sought to justify his action by saying that “girls in their teens can be easily swayed by boys under the pretext of love and to prevent any future harassment of the girls we want to make them aware that they should first complete their education and avoid indulging in such activities till then”.

One of the blackspots identified in Thiruverumbur-Navalpattu road junction

TRICHY: The district road safety council has recognized 20 accident-prone stretches and spots on national and state highways , falling outside the Trichy corporation limits, as blackspots . Corrective measures such as establishing adequate high-mast lamps, speed reduction mechanisms, foot-over-bridge and subways were suggested by the council for the stakeholders to prevent accidents in future.

The council chaired by the district collector S Sivarasu identified the spots based on the suggestions from Trichy rural police. The spots fall within the jurisdictional limits of 14 rural police stations in the district. The locations were deemed as accident-prone based on the statistics of fatal and non-fatal accidents recorded in recent years. Thuvarankurichi, Thuvakudi and Jeeyapuram localities have the maximum number of blackspots. In Navalpattu, Bharathidasan University’s campus zone near Mathur on Trichy-Pudukkottai NH was identified as one of the 20 blackspots. Police and the road safety council have proposed a foot-over-bridge across the highway for the university students to cross the road. “Solutions that can be provided in a short span such as equipping the blackspots with adequate lights were insisted to be completed before the next road safety meeting ,” said M Sekaran, member of the road safety council.

In Thiruverumbur locality, Navalpattu road joining near the bus stop on Trichy-Thanjavur NH was identified as an accident-prone stretch. As a solution, a new service road in Thiruverumbur Bazaar Street and a subway for pedestrians to cross the stretch were suggested to be established. Buses halting at the NH near Thirupattur Road junction on Trichy-Chennai NH in Siruganur was identified as one of the causes of the accidents. Stakeholder departments including police, state highways and national highways project implementation units (PIU) were told to implement the precautionary measures for eliminating the blackspots at the earliest.

AHMEDABAD: In this case, the prosecution had undertaken “huge efforts” to bring evidence on record in a case of trespassing and beating, but the accused went scot-free. This was because the prosecution took these huge efforts nearly 33 years after the incident took place.

The metropolitan court has recently acquitted two persons – Tulsiram Jadav and Munna Thakor – of charges of trespassing, assault, damaging property and criminal intimidation in a 1987 case. This happened because the prosecution could bring only one witness in witness box and she too turned hostile.

The court acquitted the accused with observation, “The complainant and victim are not available, the prosecution could not bring evidence on record despite its huge efforts.” The court did not find evidence enough even to go ahead to the second stage of recording evidence by the accused and did not undertake the process of recording further statement under the provisions of Section 313 of the CrPC.

According to case details, four persons Jadav, Thakor, Cheluji Dabhi and Navin Madrasi were booked for assaulting people by illegally entering the house of one Dahiben Bhailalbhai in Khokhra locality in April 1987. The case remained pending for over three decades.

Most of the time, the accused persons were not available. Dabhi and Madrasi did not turn up in response to warrants and they were charged separately. Finally, when trial took place against the remaining two accused, witnesses did not turn up on court’s summons. The court was informed that the complainant and the victim had shifted from the place some 25 years ago.

In response to one summons, the court received a photocopy of death certificate of the witness. Even the investigating officer, PSI S N Sharma’s presence could not be secured in court as his whereabout could not be known after he retired from police service from his last posting in Vadodara.

The only witness that appeared in court in this case was one Calvina Christian. She said that she had no personal knowledge about the incident. She was declared hostile.

Nashik: The state urban development department has stayed the Nashik Municipal Corporation’s (NMC) proposed land acquisition worth Rs 157 crore.

The NMC’s standing committee had convened a meeting on Friday to decide on various developmental works where proposals of land acquisitions were also to be tabled.

Even a general body meeting on the issue was slated to take place on Saturday.

The stay comes in wake of a letter sent by leader of opposition in NMC and senior Shiv Sena leader Ajay Boraste to state urban development department, alleging violation of norms of land acquisitions. The urban development department sent a letter to municipal commissioner Radhakrishna Game on Wednesday directing the civic body to refrain from taking any decision on this issue till further orders.

Game has been directed to submit a detailed report about land acquisitions that has to be acquired and for what purposes. The opposition has alleged that the proposed land acquisition was supposed to benefit a section of the real estate firms.

A senior civic official confirmed that the state government has stayed the proposed land acquisitions. “The general body meeting had been called on Saturday to discuss the land acquisition proposals by the civic administration, but the meeting will not take place now,” he said.

During the general body meeting held on Monday, opposition party leaders had alleged financial irregularities in the land acquisition proposals.

Boraste had alleged that the priorities for acquisitions of land reservations have already been decided. “The NMC had acquired some lands of farmers in the past, but has still not paid the compensation. Hence, the administration should first give compensation to the farmers who had given the land for various projects to NMC in the past,” he had said.

The leader of the opposition also demanded that proposals of the land acquisitions should be tabled in the general body meeting before presenting it to the standing committee. Thereafter, Boraste had complained to the urban development department.

Limiting ourselves beyond essential needs will certainly make a difference,” he said.

Rescue workers pulling the car out of AMR canal on Thursday

HYDERABAD: Three members of a family travelling in a car drowned in a canal of Alimineti Madhava Reddy (AMR) project at PA Pally in Nalgonda after their vehicle fell into it on Thursday morning. However, one of the family members, a class 8 student, was rescued by two villagers, who got into the canal and pulled him out of the vehicle.

Incidentally, it was the third such incident in the past month, wherein vehicles landed in water bodies, resulting in death of people travelling in them..

Around 8.30am, V Rangaiah, 40, his wife Alivelu, 38, their daughter Keerthi, 20, a BTech student, and son Karthik, a class 8 student, started their return journey to Hyderabad from Timapur village in Devarkonda, Nalgonda police said.

Around 8.45am, when they were travelling on the bund along the canal of AMR project, Rangaiah, who operates an earth mover, lost control over the vehicle and it slipped into the canal as there was no safety barrier.

A few minutes later, two locals — Vijay and Ram Babu, who were also from Timapur village and were passing by the bund, they spotted the car submerging in the water.

Immediately, they got into the water to save persons trapped in the car. Vijay and Babu could manage to pull out Karthik from the car, but minutes later it submerged completely in the canal, which was around 15 feet deep.

“When Vijay and Babu first saw the car in the canal, it was still afloat. By the time they saved Karthik, it started to submerge. Rangaiah, Alivelu and Keerthi died in the mishap,’’ deputy superintendent of police, Devarakonda division Anand Reddy told TOI.

Rangaiah’s family went to meet his parents in Timapur on Tuesday. Police were yet to ascertain what led to the car slipping into the canal.

Police, quoting Karthik, said none of them knew swimming and out of panic they did not get out of the vehicle.

Later, when police were informed about the accident, they reached the spot and, using ropes, brought out the car. The bodies were shifted to a local government hospital for post-mortem examination (PME).

Winners of the contest seen with dignitaries

Nagpur: Youngsters gave vent to their ire against excessive reservation in various sectors that deprives deserving candidates of their right to further their career as guaranteed by the Constitution of India.

These feelings were expressed by senior college students at the first intra-collegiate elocution competition on ‘Reservation in New India’, organized by Save Merit Save Nation (SMSN), in association with The Times of India, at LAD College as part of ‘Sanvaad’ programme recently.

The competition was inaugurated by LAD principal Deepali Kotwal while faculty member Prachiti Bagadey was the convener. Bhavna Khapekar was the coordinator. Educationist Shobha Dhanwatey, marathoner Mitesh Rambhia and Vijay Upadhyay were the judges. Rashmi Shukla conducted the proceedings.

The students deplored what they called abuse by political parties of the Constitution of India, framed by Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar, for vote bank politics. They said creamy layer rule and weighted indexing system should be made applicable in all reserved categories.

SMSN has taken an initiative to know and compile the views of youngsters on the subject for building a progressive India which will maintain a fair balance between merit and reservation. SMSN is against the divisive vote bank politics that often leads to caste hatred.

It has opposed excessive reservation which is more than 50% that leaves only one out of 10 seats to open category youngsters in education and jobs.

Navjot Kaur Dhoot of BBA second semester won the first prize in the contest. Ishani Vijayan and Amruta Dalvi of BBA fourth semester won the second and third prize, respectively.

College and student associations interested in holding such events can contact SMSN convener Brijesh Segan on 9822225776.

Dr Sanjay Deshpande, SMSN state president and Dr Anup Marar, secretary, said they intend to hold more such events to unite youths for building a progressive nation. “It is high time we keep aside hatred spewing divisive politics and exchange constructive thoughts in a positive manner,” they said.

Currenly, only grapes are being sent from Nashik to Guwahati, which takes at least five days by road.

“It will take only three hours if the consignment is sent by air to Guwahati. We discussed sending fruits and vegetables fom Ozar airport to the Northeast with Spicejet officials. The airline wants to start a dedicated freighter to transport vegetables and fruits under the Krishi Uddan scheme,” said a Halcon official adding the capacity of the air cargo would be 18-20 tonne.

Halcon has developed an inland container depot (ICD) and an air cargo complex adjacent to the Ozar airport, which is equipped with a packhouse, cold storages and other facilities. Currently, Halcon exports around 4,500 tonne of fresh vegetables and fruits annually to London, Dubai and other international markets via Mumbai.

Halcon officials said farmers from Nashik and adjoining districts would get access to more markets if regular cargo flights begin from Ozar. Also, farmers would get a better price for their produce if air cargo services were started from Nashik to the Northeast.

Bijnor: Police in Amroha have arrested a man on Thursday for allegedly murdering his wife, who he claimed to have killed his two minor children.

Police said that the accused Mohammad Aasif took the extreme step after his ‘mentally ill’ wife allegedly murdered his minor children, adding that he even tried to portray his wife’s murder as a suicide.

According to police, the body of Saaema (26) was found hanging on February 13 while her two children — a two-year-old daughter and one-year-old son — were found dead under mysterious circumstances at their house in Sentali village.

Initially, Aasif had claimed that his wife hanged herself after killing her two children. However, the postmortem report revealed that the cause of death was stated as strangulation.

Based on a written complaint lodged by Saaema’s brother, an FIR under relevant sections was registered against Aasif, his brother Aakib, sister Salma, and sister’s husband Rizwan.

Investigation later revealed that Aasif had strangulated his wife on February 13.

Amroha superintendent of police Vipin Tada claimed, “The accused has confessed to his crime. He was embarrassed because she was mentally ill and used to roam around naked. Even though her treatment was going on, he wanted to get rid of her. He had tried to eliminate her earlier too but failed. When he returned home on February 13, he found his two children lying dead on the bed and Saeema was standing around their bodies. This enraged him and he strangulated her.”

He said the possibility of murder is also being considered and presented the names of three additional suspects identified on February 11, 12 and 13. He, however, did not disclose the names in the open court.Senior counsel Nitin Sardessai , representing Wilson, told the court that the authenticity of the WhatsApp message sent by Naik minutes before his death must be verified and added the police were under pressure to file an FIR after Naik’s family threatened not to cremate the body.

TRICHY: The district child welfare committee (CWC) has rescued 1,210 children below 18-years, who were victim to various circumstances, in 2019 and has sought the cooperation of all stake holders to ensure the welfare of children. The committee was set up on November 17, 2018.

“Achieving the goal of child welfare, rehabilitation and restoration would not be possible but for the cooperation from all stake holders. In order to ensure their support, CWC is now organising meeting with all of them and discussing the issues coming in the way of rescue and rehabilitation of the children,” said CWC member N Krishnamoorthy on Thursday.

The meeting held on Thursday was attended by officials from the deputy director of health services (DDHS), district social welfare office (DSWO), district child protection unit (DCPU), railway children India, anti-child trafficking unit, integrated child development scheme (ICDS), district differently-abled welfare office, child labour elimination and effective rehabilitation society, labour department, Samagra Shiksha and ChildLine.

CWC highlighted the recent illegal sale of two babies by their parents to adoptive parents in Trichy and advised DDHS officials to keep track of ante-natal mothers enrolling in primary health centres.

“The two cases of illegal adoption highlights a disturbing trend. In one of the cases, the birth record at the PHC was doctored to replace the name of the biological parents with the adoptive parents. It can be prevented if the personal information of the pregnant women is collected clearly,” said CWC member Dr M Gnanavelu.

The rehabilitated children include child marriage victims, run-away children, child labourers, sexual abuse victims, abandoned children etc.

The committee also raised concern about post-child marriage follow up in Trichy. The members asked DSWO officials to keep track of rescued child marriage victim for certain period to avoid the victims being forced into child marriage again.

CWC said it would coordinate with stake holders to conduct the meeting once in three months.

Bijnor: The bail applications of three men accused of being involved in violence during anti-Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) protests in Bijnor, have been rejected by a court here. The three men were involved in violence which took place in Bijnor’s Nahtaur area. Bijnor police had filed three FIRs in Nahtaur against 1,000 unnamed and 18 named protesters after the December 20 violence.

The bail pleas of Gulzar Ahmad, Harun Ahmad and Jafar were rejected by additional district and sessions judge Sanjeev Pandey on Wednesday.

During the hearing, government counsel Sanjeev Verma objected to several facts produced by defendants’ lawyer and claimed, “The three protesters were arrested from the violence spot. Country-made pistols and cartridges were also recovered from their possession. There were over 1,000 people protesting against CAA on December 20 at Nahtaur. Police tried to pacify them but they did not heed to them and turned aggressive. They opened fire at policemen and pelted stones. Several police personnel and common men were injured.”

After hearing the pleas of both the sides, judge Pandey rejected the bail pleas of the three protesters. “Keeping all the facts in mind, the court found that crime’s nature is serious and protesters do not have enough ground to be granted bail,” the judge observed. Last week, the court had rejected the bail pleas of 30 protesters in Bijnor.

Secunderabad: Lack of coordination between the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) and Hyderabad Metropolitan Water Supply and Sewerage Board (HMWS&SB) prior to undertaking development works at Pipeline Road in Jeedimetla is causing frequent traffic jams on the stretch.

Commuters are having a tough time as GHMC workers had dug up the road a month ago for laying a CC road. However, the water board again dug up the newly-laid road for laying drainage pipelines. “The road is used by several people daily, and yet, the debris is right in the middle of the road. Many take this road to reach Suchitra Junction. I request the authorities to restore it immediately,” said Chakra Teja, a resident of Jeedimetla.

GHMC deputy commissioner of Qutbullapur, Manga Tayaru, said the GHMC will restore the road immediately. “To ensure better coordination between line departments, we are holding a convergence meeting every month,” said a senior GHMC official.

While the onus of laying roads is on the GHMC, as per the rules, the water board must ensure building utilities are not damaged and any work relating to drains and manholes is supposed to be undertaken before a road is laid.

The HMRL is rebuilding the medians with bigger pipelines to ensure water drains out

SECUNDERABAD: The shoddy repair work by the Hyderabad Metro Rail Limited (HMRL) while constructing central medians at Punjagutta has prompted the Metro officials to rebuild the medians to avoid the stretch from getting waterlogged during rains. The HMRL is rebuilding the medians with bigger pipelines to ensure water drains out.

Experts said that before executing a project, a digital survey has to be conducted to understand the contours. “While constructing a median , the problems that can be faced during a natural disaster have to be taken into account,” said Structural Engineers World Congress-India vice-president and infrastructure expert Dr SP Anchuri.

Addressing concerns, the HMRL said that the taxpayers’ money is not being utilised to rebuild the medians. “The advertisers who had put up ads at the medians have outsourced the job to contractors. The HMRL has come up with a good solution to the problem,” NVS Reddy, managing director, HMRL told TOI.

According to Reddy, in the earlier medians, the outlets which allow the water to flow towards the corner of the road during rains were smaller in diameter and this may cause waterlogging. The HMRL officials added that a ground verification found that the slope is uneven, which restricts water from flowing into manholes located towards the corner of the road. “I will speak to the GHMC commissioner and ask him to ensure that the water seamlessly flows into the manholes,” he said.

Meanwhile, the GHMC engineers admitted that several roads in the city were being damaged due to waterlogging.

“Even the best quality bitumen can be destroyed due to stagnant water,” said a GHMC engineer.

Meerut: They had left the dusty tracks of UP’s Bulandshahr in hope of a better life in Delhi. They were doing well, till the communal violence cut their lives short. Now their bodies are arriving, one after another. So far, three persons from the district have been confirmed killed in the national capital.

Ashfaq Hussain (22), an electrician who got married just 10 days ago, was killed when he went out for work. Shahid Khan (25), an auto-rickshaw driver, was returning home after dropping a passenger when he was shot dead. Shaban Aziz, 22, a labourer, was the third causality from Bulandshahr. He lived with his family in Delhi’s Gokulpuri area.

So far, 38 people have been declared dead in Delhi’s communal clash.

The violence not only sent bodies back home, it also crushed some dreams. A wedding was postponed at the last moment in Bulandshahr’s Sikandarabad area on Tuesday. The ‘baarat’ was to come from Mustafabad-- one of the epicentres of riots that broke out in the national capital.

Nagina, 22, was set to marry a man from Mustafabad area of Delhi. She is distraught now. Due to the tense situation in riot-hit area, the baarat didn’t turn up.

“Nagina and her younger sister Rani were getting married on the same day. While Rani got married to a man from Okhla in Delhi, her elder sister’s wedding was temporarily postponed after ‘baarat’ didn’t arrive,” says Jameel Malik, uncle of the sisters.

“The preparation for the feast and other arrangements were made, but the ‘baarat’ didn’t arrive due to tension in Mustafabad. I hope the normalcy is restored soon,” said Yameen Malik, father of the bride.

MANDYA: Minister KC Narayanagowda stirred a row after allegedly praising Maharashtra and Marathi in a programme held in KR Pete a week. A video of the alleged incident surfaced on Thursday and was widely shared on social media.

In the video, Narayanagowda allegedly boasts of his growth as an hotelier and realtor in Maharashtra and attributes all his good fortune to the neighbouring state.

“Maharashtra is my strength,” Narayanagowda purportedly says. “Whatever I’ve achieved in my life as hotelier, realtor and now as a minister, Maharashtra is the reason for that. If I have strength and power, then it belongs to Maharashtra only. I have no qualms in praising Maharashtra and Shivaji.”

Narayanagowda’s purported comments have, obviously, not gone down well with pro-Kannada activists, who held a protest in Mandya on Thursday. Various organisations also demanded an apology from Narayanagowda and sought his resignation.

Karnataka Raskhana Vedike (KRV) activists, who held a protest at Sri Nalvadi Circle on the Mysuru-Bengaluru highway, raised slogans against Narayanagowda and dubbed him a Marathi.

“How can he continue as a minister in Karnataka when he has openly declared allegiance to Maharashtra? Whose side is he on with regard to the border dispute with Maharashtra?” asked protesters.

Protesters warned of a fierce agitation if chief minister BS Yediyurappa did not remove Narayanagowda immediately from his cabinet.

“I will apologise only if opposition leaders tender an open apology for their derogatory remarks made against Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Hindutva icon Vinayak Damodar Savarkar in the past,” Yatnal, who represents Vijayapura in the assembly, said on Thursday.

In a touch of defiance, Yatnal went on to say: “Who is Doreswamy? What kind of freedom fighter is he? Was he lodged in Andaman jail during the freedom movement? I don’t think so. He is just a Congressman who is opposing the Citizenship Amendment Act.”

The opposition Congress has decided to continue its protest till Yatnal tenders a public apology. Former minister and Congress legislator UT Khader accused the BJP of revealing its “true colours” and “hidden agenda” by criticising freedom fighters and branding anyone it dislikes as traitors.

“The saffron party is apparently afflicted with the Pakistan virus for which there is no cure available in India,” Khader said. “They should get medicine from Pakistan itself to cure the disease.”

Functionaries who pass derogatory comments against the Independence movement are real traitors, Khader said insisting chief minister BS Yediyurappa and BJP leadership should clarify their stand on Yatnal’s comments.

Former minister and senior Congress functionary HC Mahadevappa said Congress will continue to stage protests both inside and outside the assembly in the upcoming budget session and the protests will continue till Yatnal apologises.

“If BJP really believes in [Mahatma] Gandhi’s ideologies, then the saffron party must initiate action against Yatnal,” Mahadevappa said. “Or else they will be deemed anti-Gandhi. The BJP did not contribute anything to the freedom struggle. Now, its leaders are humiliating freedom fighters.”

214,['28/02/2020'],"2 Maha students back from Wuhan; 195 from China, Japan","This story is from February 28, 2020

Mumbai/New Delhi: Two PhD students from the state, who chose to stay back in Wuhan when the first batch of Indians was evacuated in January after the coronavirus outbreak, landed in Delhi on Thursday.

In a major rescue exercise, India on Thursday evacuated 195 nationals from Japan and China. While 119 people were evacuated from cruise ship Diamond Princess in Japan, 76 more were brought back from Wuhan by a relief military aircraft. India also evacuated 36 foreign nationals from Wuhan and five from Japan.

Students Girish Patil (29) and Chandradip Jadhav (29), studying at College of Materials and Metallurgy, Wuhan University of Science and Technology, had opted to stay back in Wuhan—the epicentre of the outbreak—due to financial constraints. From Delhi airport, the students, along with other Indians from Wuhan, were sent to the quarantine centre at Chawla camp for 14 days.

Patil and Jadhav, both residents of Dhule, were among the bunch of six Indian students who stayed back in the university’s dormitory. One of the six said now the university has officially extended the holidays for a few months. They also gave them a no objection certificate for evacuation, he added.

Meanwhile, the special Air India flight that brought back 119 Indian and five foreign nationals from Diamond Princess cruise liner early on Thursday includes two Mira Road residents. Mira Road’s Dinesh Thakkar was at the forefront of the effort to get back his daughter Sonali who worked as a security personnel on Diamond Princess. “My daughter spoke to us briefly on landing and after reaching the army quarantine spot in Haryana,” said Dinesh.

“The evacuation has underscored the priority India attaches to the welfare of its citizens wherever they are,” said foreign secretary Harsh Shringla. He added that India was “happy to have been able to assist our friends from Bangladesh, Myanmar, Maldives and other friendly countries from our neighbourhood and beyond in the evacuations from both China and Japan”. Of the 36 foreign nationals evacuated from Wuhan, 23 were from Bangladesh, six from China, two each from Myanmar and Maldives and one each from South Africa, US and Madagascar. Of the five from Japan, there were two from Sri Lanka and one each from Nepal, South Africa and Peru.

The Indian relief flight to Wuhan carried 15,000kg of medical assistance comprising masks, gloves and other emergency medical equipment. These supplies were delivered by an IAF C-17 special flight, which landed in Wuhan late on Wednesday evening. The medical supplies followed Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s letter to President Xi Jinping offering assistance to deal with the crisis. “The medical supplies will help augment the China’s efforts to control the outbreak of this infection which has been declared as a public health emergency by the World Health Organisation,’’ the MEA said in a statement.

Some of India’s neighbours such as Bangladesh and Sri Lanka had sought help from India to evacuate their citizens. The government said assistance to them was in keeping with India’s neighbourhood first policy. India has until now operated three relief flights from Wuhan, evacuating 723 Indian nationals and 43 foreign nationals. In the case of Japan, a special Air India flight landed in New Delhi from Tokyo on Thursday, bringing back 119 Indian nationals—113 crew members and six passengers—who were on board the Diamond Princess which docked off Yokohama in Japan. “In line with India’s neighbourhood first policy and Indo-Pacific vision, the special flight also evacuated five foreign nationals—two Sri Lankans, one Nepalese, one South African and one Peruvian. All the evacuees will undergo a 14-day quarantine at the facility set up by the Indian Army in Manesar, Haryana,” the MEA said.

Three Indian crew members did not board the special flight and conveyed their wish, according to the government, to continue their stay on board the cruise ship to complete the period of extended quarantine put in place by the Japan government.

“Out of the total 138 Indian nationals originally on board the Diamond Princess, 16 Indian crew members have tested positive for coronavirus 2019 and are receiving necessary medical care and treatment at onshore medical facilities in Japan. Embassy of India in Tokyo has established contact with these individuals and is continuously following-up on their recovery,’’ the foreign ministry said.

MUMBAI: A 22-month-old toddler lost three of his right hand fingers in a freak escalator mishap at R-Mall in Mulund (West) on Tuesday. Chinmay Rajiwade’s fingers got stuck in a gap in a down escalator’s handrail when he tried to climb on to it on the ground floor. His father Ravindra, an autorickshsaw driver, rushed him to KEM Hospital in Parel as he was unable to afford the fees quoted by a private hospital. But the toddler’s middle, ring and little fingers could not be reattached. On Thursday, Mulund police registered an FIR against persons responsible for operating the escalator.Mall authorities, though, have denied the allegation that a technical issue could have led to the mishap.The accident occurred when Chinmay was on a shopping trip with his parents and family friends for his second birthday on April 16.He was admitted to a Mulund nursing home on Thursday after he developed a high fever. His parents suspect it to could be a side-effect of the surgery he underwent at KEM Hospital.“Initially we rushed to a private hospital but the fees quoted for surgery were very high. Thereafter, I got in touch with a friend who works in KEM and rushed there with my son, carrying the amputated fingers. They did a test and said there was barely 5% possibility of saving the fingers. So, they performed a plastic surgery. My son is now left with just two fingers on his right hand,” Ravindra (26) told TOI.The Bhandup resident said he was holding his son’s hand when the toddler freed himself and walked towards the escalator. “I ran after him but by then he had started to climb the escalator, which was moving down. He lost his balance and three of his fingers got stuck in the handrail. The mall had no security measures to operate the escalator,” said Ravindra who went to a private hospital but found the fees steep. “I make less than Rs 1,000 a day, so how can I afford huge fees for surgery? For the last three days, I have stayed home with my son. I am worried about his health. He even tries to remove the bandage from his hand,” he said.An R-Mall spokesperson said the mall team kept his fingers in the cold storage till his parents asked for them. “We take utmost care of all our customers and are committed to the highest level of safety and security of our patrons. The investigation revealed there was no technical issue in the escalator. We are cooperating with the authorities in their investigation. We pray and hope for speedy recovery of the boy,” said the spokesperson, adding mall authorities are working on a compensation plan for the toddler but refused to disclose the details.A case was registered under IPC Section 338 for causing grievous hurt by an act endangering the life or safety of others. “We will take a technical expert’s opinion. We have called mall authorities for details before deciding the course of action,” said Mulund police senior inspector Ravi Sardesai.

Encroachments being removed in Gandhi market

TRICHY: Trichy city police in a joint operation with Trichy City Corporation have evicted a section of street vendors who have encroached on a portion of arterial roads near the Gandhi market in the city. At least 50 street vendors have been relocated to an alternative site near the war memorial in the market.

According to police, public complaints and grievances came up at road safety council meetings have forced them to evict makeshift shops on Big Bazaar Street and Vellamandi Road. The officials have warned the street vendors not to return to the roads near Gandhi market and urged them to use the 4,000-square metre alternative space behind the war memorial. ""The evicted vendors were given space at Diamond Jubilee Bazaar near the corporation’s cycle stand. They have to operate only from the space allotted to them and should not occupy the roads,"" a corporation official said.

Though the traffic police had earmarked space with ropes for street vendors to do business, they often cross the line choking public mobility. ""The street vendors were asked to leave the space permanently,"" the corporation official said. The corporation will install warning boards along with the retrieved space. The relieved local people urged the authorities to maintain the order in Gandhi market.

Since city buses are halting away from bus stops, street vendors utilise the gap between the halting point and pedestrian platforms to set up their stalls, local people said. ""We will ensure that city buses pick up and drop passengers only at bus stops. But public cooperation is essential, it is the passengers who signal the buses to halt haphazardly,"" a senior police official told TOI.

TDP president N Chandrababu Naidu returns to the airport following protests by YSRC activists

VISAKHAPATNAM: The TDP president and former chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu was detained at the Visakhapatnam airport on Thursday under Section 151 of Criminal Procedure Code and was thwarted in his attempt to go on his Praja Chaitanya Yatra.

He was finally sent back to Hyderabad on a flight at 7: 20 pm.

Earlier, Naidu had landed at the Visakhapatnam airport at 11.20 am. When Naidu stepped out of the airport, YSRC cadres stopped his convoy.

But the police did not allow him to go out as supporters of YSRC and TDP were camped outside the airport. They tried to shout down each other and created a tense atmosphere.

Naidu and his supporters then sat on the road outside the airport to protest. YSRC supporters were seen holding placards that read ‘go back Naidu, traitor of north Andhra.’ Throughout the day, tension continued to mount with TDP and YSRC supporters trying to shout down each other.

Naidu was served the preventive notice by assistant commissioner of police, west, Visakhapatnam.

TDP supporters blamed the police for behaving in an undemocratic manner. Naidu said the government was behaving in a dictatorial manner and blamed the authorities for being high-handed.

In 2017, TDP cadres had blocked YS Jaganmohan Reddy in a similar manner.

YSRC cadre blocked the Naidu’s convoy from moving out of the airport. The police formed a wall between both factions. While the stalemate at the airport continued, there was traffic snarl along the highway till the NAD Junction stretch, resulting in chaos on the highway and connecting roads.

TRICHY: Over 300 students, including women, took part in the protest against CAA (citizenship amendment act) in front of Jamal Mohammed College on Thursday, for the sixth day, which also witnessed tense moments as students only dispersed after four hours while police registered a case against them.

The students blocked Khajamalai road outside the college around 12pm while the police regulated traffic to one side of the road. Unlike the previous protests in five occasion, the students refused to disperse and tried to hold indefinite protest.

The police team comprising Cantonment range ACP P Manikandan, Srirangam range ACP K Ramachandran, KK Nagar police inspector R Sahaya Anbarasu and others rushed to spot.

The protest raised remarks against CAA, national register of citizens (NRC) and national population register (NPR) besides condemning the violence in Delhi. The students blamed the Narendra Modi led BJP government at the centre for CAA and for not handling the riots properly.

Since the vociferous protests lasted for nearly two hours, the police advised the students to disperse citing nuisance to the public and inconvenience to motorists, which they ignored. The police identified some of the outsiders in the crowd and pushed them away and even sought the interference of the college administration to ask students to leave the protest.

Despite assurances from the police that they will give permission to hold similar protests few days later, the students stood firm. The police managed to get the students give up and disperse at 4pm.

The KK Nagar police registered cases against 300 students, of which 50 were named, for unlawful assembly and causing nuisance. It may be pointed out that the police has already registered cases against the students for their protests against the same issue for five days.

Makkal Adhikaram outfit also staged a demonstration near the central bus stand against the violence in Delhi on Thursday.

220,['28/02/2020'],Goa: Organic agriculture hub to be self-sustaining,"This story is from February 28, 2020

Chandrakant Kavalekar

PANAJI: Agriculture minister Chandrakant Kavalekar said that 5 lakh sqm of land in Quepem and another plot of 15 lakh sqm has been identified in Ponda to set up the organic agriculture hub. The land is already in possession of the agriculture department and state funds won’t have to be spent on acquiring land, said Kavalekar. His comments come in the backdrop of a section of academicians criticising the decision to strain state finances to set up an agriculture university from scratch in Goa.

Kavalekar said the organic agriculture university is only one aspect of a larger plan to establish an organic agriculture hub in Goa. The hub will carry out research into organic farming, will do certification of organic agricultural produce, and will help in marketing and branding organic products.

“Already in 500 clusters covering 10,000 hectares of agricultural land, farmers are being helped to switch to organic agriculture. Within a three-year period, these farmers will be producing fully organic yield. We will help them in certification of organic produce, which will help them fetch a much bigger price. Organic fields also yield much better quantities of produce. So this will help boost production within the existing agricultural land in Goa, with the research carried out at the hub further helping in achieving this objective,” said Kavalekar.

While Kavalekar’s project is being criticised for its initial requirement of Rs 410 crore to set up the organic agriculture hub, the minister said the money is not to be invested within one financial year but in phases to develop the project.

“We have already written to authorities at the Centre for funds for the institute. We want the hub to help Goa become a fully organic agriculture state on the lines of Sikkim. As our hub will provide certification and marketing and branding services, it will generate its own revenue, besides the help we will receive from the Centre. So it will be a self-sustaining project and won’t be a burden on state finances,” Kavalekar told TOI.

“Those criticising the project have not understood that all 65 agriculture universities have been set up under ICAR, which comes under the agriculture ministry and not the HRD ministry,” he said.

TRICHY: The public works department (PWD) is all set to launch a first-of-its-kind environment library in Trichy by the end of next month. While the state government had allocated Rs 5 lakh in the first phase for the library, a seminar and exhibition hall will also be raised in the coming weeks.

Government funds for the project came along with ecological restoration of eight water bodies in the state apart from conducting descriptive study, assessment of pollution and preparation of detailed project report in August last year. The library is being raised on a portion of the existing staff training institute building of PWD in Trichy. Saying that the seminar will be conducted once a week by inviting experts in environment studies, a senior PWD official said the library will be helpful for officials to know various aspects of a project and environmental implications.

While PWD has started asking for environmental clearance for most projects it sanctions of late, the official said there has been very less awareness among people about this in the area. Further, there are also very few avenues to refer to the legal aspects related to environmental clearance. College students too can make use of the facility, said the official.

Nashik: The Nashik Municipal Corporation’s (NMC) auction of properties, which belong to property tax defaulters, received poor response on Thursday.

A total of 89 properties were to go under the hammer, but the civic body did not receive a single bid. It was the NMC’s second attempt at auctioning properties of the defaulters.

Last month, the NMC had put up another 44 properties for auction, but then too, it did not receive any response. Now, the civic body has decided to change ownership of these 133 properties on the 7/12 extract.

A civic official said they will soon start the process to change the ownership and will approach tehsildar to complete the process.

“As per norms, the civic body may change the ownership if it does not receive response to auction of properties of tax defaulters for two times. We may take the decision following approval from the standing committee,” he said.

Earlier, the NMC had set a property tax collection target of Rs 218 crore for the current financial year 2019-20, but has so far managed to collect only Rs 133 crore. Hence, the civic administration has revised the property tax collection target to Rs 140 crore.

Municipal commissioner Radhakrishna Game recently presented the civic draft budget for the financial year 2020-21 to the standing committee for its approval. In the budget, the NMC has set a property tax collection target of Rs 170 crore.

In the last financial year, 2018-19, the NMC had collected property tax amounting to Rs 117.12 crore. It was for the first time that the NMC’s property tax collection target had touched Rs 100 crore.

“There are total 1.92 lakh tax defaulters having dues from Rs 4,000 to Rs 1 lakh. The civic administration has served notices to 1.85 lakh property tax defaulters, giving them a deadline of 21 days to pay their taxes,” a civic official said.

File photo of Jawaharlal Nehru Technological University

HYDERABAD: Jawaharlal Nehru Technological University , Hyderabad (JNTUH) is facing a dearth of faculty members who can teach students new courses in emerging technologies that are set to be introduced from the academic year 2020-21.

Ahead of the affiliation process, the JNTUH approved four new BTech courses in artificial intelligence (AI), computer science & information technology, computer science & business systems and information technology & engineering. While the state government has plans to train about 30,000 students in AI-based skills, shortage of faculty members to teach these emerging technologies has emerged as a major challenge for JNTUH.

“We may start 10 new courses but where are the people to teach those courses? The state government needs to support a large-scale faculty development programme so that the gap can be filled,” said Jayesh Ranjan, in-charge vice-chancellor, JNTUH.

Last year, apart from Indian Institute of Technology, Hyderabad (IIT-H) that had 20 seats in a full-fledged BTech course in AI, there were only 84 seats in two colleges affiliated to JNTUH that offer a BTech course in AI. This year, although the number of seats is set to increase, the number of faculty members teaching these courses is in double digits.

“An MTech degree or PhD degree does not qualify someone to be an assistant professor or an associate professor. Right now, with an MTech, they become assistant professors. Teachers have to be qualified. They should receive a six months certification before becoming assistant professors in the next two years,” said BVR Mohan Reddy, executive chairman of Cyient Ltd., who also headed a panel that drafted the short-term and long-term perspective for the All India Council of Technical Education (AICTE).

The Telangana State Council of Higher Education (TSCHE) is planning to introduce a large faculty development programme to meet the demand for teachers who can teach these emerging technologies to students. In order to do that, the TSCHE has decided to seek help from coveted institutions such as IITH, International Institute of Information Technology, National Institute of Technology-Warangal and Birla Institute of Technology.

“There is a need to shift from mere classroom teaching to developing creative talent. We can strengthen faculty through capacity building activities and close interaction with industrial organisations by sending them to companies for a few days for on-ground experience,” said Chitra Ramachandran, chief special secretary (education).

AHMEDABAD: Sardarnagar police on Wednesday booked one Jay Tekwani for illegal money-lending and criminal intimidation, based on a complaint filed by Krunal Lasiyani, 30, of Sardarnagar alleging that Tekwani had been threatening him for recovery of money. “We have booked the accused under sections 294 (b),506 (2), 507, 114 IPC and under Gujarat Money-Lenders Act. We will soon arrest him,” said a senior police official.

According to the FIR, Lasiyani had returned to Gujarat after working in Dubai about three years ago, and began working as a broker at Choka Bazar. To expand his business, he first first borrowed Rs 10 lakh and then Rs 30 lakh from Tekwani at a monthly interest of 7%. He claimed that he had already paid back Rs 40,00,000 but Tekwani maintains that Lasiyani owes him another Rs 45,00,000.

Lasiyani has stated that he used to pay his daily instalments of Rs 10,000 at the office of one Umesh Goplani at A ward in Sardarnagar. After running into losses he failed to pay the daily instalments, but by that time he had already paid back Rs 40,00,000. However, Tekwani told him that he will have to pay another Rs 45,00,000 within 15 days.

Narmada canal network in Gujarat

AHMEDABAD: Deputy chief minister Nitin Patel on Thursday blamed Congress leaders Sonia Gandhi and Ahmed Patel for the delay in completion of the Narmada canal network in the state. He was participating in a discussion on Narmada canal network and sub-canals.

Congress MLA from Morbi , Brijesh Merja said that the BJP government has been neglecting farmers from Saurashtra. “Due to the delay in canal works, farmers have been suffering,” he said.

Reacting to this, the deputy CM said the the Congress government at the Centre had not permitted installation of the gates, leading to delay in the work.

The leader of opposition in the assembly, Paresh Dhanani, claimed that the delay was caused by the then BJP government in Madhya Pradesh. Dhanani said the MP government had objected to giving permission to installation of the gates. Taking it further, Nitin Patel said that it was former Union minister Saifuddin Soz who had denied permission, after which the then chief minister Narendra Modi sat on a fast.

Later, Patel said that one person is not giving his land for the construction of the canal, leading to the delay. He said the government will take action against this person.

RAJKOT: Archaeologists have got more clinching evidence of a thriving human settlement dating to pre-Harappan times in Khatia village close to Lakhpat in Kutch district.

Exactly a year after excavating 25 burial sites out of the total around 250, the archaeologists found skeletal remains of a woman’s hands, which had bangles, from one of three additional graves dug out since February 17.

One hand had 16 bangles and the other three. All bangles were made of shells, which indicates that they were procured from the nearby seashore.

Moreover, the previously excavated sites had cemeteries made of small-size stones while a few excavated recently are made of big slabs of stones. The burial sites are estimated to be around 4,600 to 5,000 years old.

Last year, they had found a human skeleton from one of the burial sites.

Some pottery items were also found from the graves. “This shows that there may have been a tradition to bury all the belongings of the dead with their bodies,” said Subhash Bhanderi, head of archaeological department of Kutch University .

“We are also trying to study the reason for use of different stones to build graves. Was it some cultural change?” he added.

What is important, according to archaeologists, is the direction of the graves found last year and the ones excavated in the last 10 days as it would help understand the change of culture and their eras.

“The 25-odd burial sites found last year were made in east-west direction with the head pointing eastwards. Of the three dug out recently, two are south direction while one is in an unusual north east-south-west direction,” said Bhanderi.

The present excavation is being jointly done by Kutch university and Kerala University and state archaeologists.

Dr Rajesh SV, a faculty from Kerala University said, “Detailed studies including that of DNA, geochemistry and proper dating of the sediments, bones, pottery and shells will be done to know the age, climate as well as ecology of the people residing in the vicinity.”

Scientists from Jawaharlal Nehru University, Dharvad University and experts coming from Texas, US, are expected to visit this site soon. These are experts in the field of anthropology, archaeology and DNA testing etc.

Dehradun: Environmentalists, scientists and academicians will gather at Wildlife Institute of India to decide the indicators of ‘ Gross Environment Product ’ (GEP) on March 5. Doon-based environmentalist Anil Joshi while announcing the event on Thursday said, “GEP can help us analyse how developmental projects are causing environmental degradation.”

Notably, Joshi will spearhead the entire initiative at Wildlife Institute of India. The high-level conference will be attended by Krishnaswamy Vijay Raghavan, Principal Scientific Advisor (PSA) to the Prime Minister and directors of leading institutions like FRI, Wadia Institute, and others.

Uttarakhand has been the torchbearer in attracting country’s focus towards measuring ecological development of a state along with its economic development, an order was also passed in year 2010 to have GEP concept by the High Court.

As per TOI sources, GEP was initially accepted by the former governments of Uttarakhand and simultaneously, a petition has approved by High Court also supporting the concept of GEP. The State has also been directed by High Court to follow such appeal of Dr. Anil P. Joshi though nothing has been done in this regards in past ten years.

After almost a decade, once again GEP has come to fore with experts mulling to bring ecosystem at the core of development of country.

“We have to develop in tandem to the eco-system because eco-system cannot develop in tandem to us. Our economy should be seen growing with its ecology not alone otherwise we all are heading to devastation.” he added.

At the conference, indicators to decide GEP will be zeroed in upon and also stratergy will be formulated to pass on the GEP concept across the country and in each state of nation.

Current growth measure is totally lopsided as per scientists and environmentalists as it focuses upon economic growths only. “It does not account status of various resources depleted or added annually. The later is equally important for survival and sustainable growth.” added Joshi.

To strike a balance between economy and ecology development, Anil Joshi under the aegis of his organisation HESCO would ask the experts to include the quality and quantify of – forest, soil, water and air – as the prime indicators of GEP of any state as per TOI sources.

Trichy: Residents in Trichy have urged the city police and Trichy City Corporation to extend the eviction drive carried out in the Gandhi Market on Thursday to other congested parts of the city as well, since the authorities have failed in constituting the street vending committee and encroachments are ever increasing in most of the commercial streets and on arterial roads.

“Now the roads in Gandhi Market look spacious. Not sure how long the city police will keep the street like this,” K Ramachandran, a trader in Gandhi Market, said. The corporation said that a section of street vendors are intentionally derailing the plan to constitute the street vending committee. The committee to be formed as per the Tamil Nadu Street Vendors 2015 Act will regulate street vendors by earmarking no vending zones, which mean that hawkers will not be allowed to operate from such zones. Members of the hawkers will be elected to the committee to provide amenities and financial support to the street vendors at the vending zones where they will be permitted to function.

However, the local body’s attempts since 2018 are being legally challenged and stopped by a section of street vendors who claim that the civic body has not completed the enumeration of hawkers across the city. The corporation’s call that the enumeration process can be completed after forming the vending committee is not accepted by the street vendors. “Eviction drive from the corporation and city police near Gandhi market is a welcome move. We urge the authorities to make sure that the roads are meant only for vehicular and pedestrian movements,” S Pushpavanam, secretary, Consumer Protection Council, Tamil Nadu, said.

HYDERABAD: Hazardous metals found in e-waste are polluting the soil and water, said experts on Thursday at a seminar on ‘E-Waste Management- Sustainable Development’ organised by The Federation of Telangana Chambers of Commerce and Industry ( FTCCI ).

Kumar Pathak, an environmental engineer with the TPCB , said, “The greatest danger today is the unscientific disposal of e-waste. Hazardous substances, especially heavy metals such as cadmium, mercury and lead, can pollute the environment and have detrimental impact on health if not disposed responsibly.”

Pathak said that pressure must be put on manufacturers to reduce the use of hazardous material to lesser than 0.1%. He said, “While there are collection centres for e-waste many do not meet the standards prescribed by the Central Pollution Control Board.”

J Koteswara Rao, associate faculty member at National Institute for Micro, Small & Medium Enterprises said that the leeching of heavy metals into the soil and groundwater is concerning as even minimal cadmium could pollute 600 cubic metres of water.

Speaking about the amount of waste heading to the unorganised sector, K Srinivas, V-P of Ramky Enviro Engineers Limited, said, “At most 40% of e-waste is recovered by untrained players. Many workers burn e-waste, resulting in toxic fumes.”

Nashik: An assistant professor of a city-based engineering college recently visited the European Space Agency (ESA) in Germany

Jaydeep Shah (36) was one of the 37 space enthusiasts who were selected to join the ESA’s Mission Control programme to watch the launch of Solar Orbiter. It is an annual outreach programme of the ESA.

The two-day event was scheduled on February 5 and 6. Shah could only attend the lectures and the technical tour on the first day as the second day’s event was postponed to February 10.

“A social space event gives an unique opportunity to interact with mission specialists, flight directors and the engineering team. It was the best experience of my life. Unfortunately, I missed the launch of the Solar Orbiter and media briefing due to my pre-booked tickets but the whole experience was thrilling,” said Shah. He was the only participant from the Asia Pacific to join the programme. The agency had reviewed his social media pages of the past seven years, on the basis of which he was selected for the event.

“I showed them my 36,000 tweets, 5,000 posts on Facebook and 1,990 posts on LinkedIn, all related to astronomy,” added Shah.

“The ESA had provided a link in January on their Twitter platform for a day where hundreds of people applied for their candidature. The agency had selected only 13 candidates from countries like the United Kingdom, the USA, Spain, the Netherlands, Austria, Serbia etc. The others were from Germany,” Shah said.

Originally from Gujarat, Shah teaches electric vehicles and smart grid at K K Wagh College of Engineering. Shah had designed the subject of smart grid for the SPPU.

The groups met the Bicholim deputy collector Jyoti Kumari on Thursday, and the final call on whether the festival will commence will be taken on Friday. It is scheduled to take place from February 28 to March 7. Bicholim mamlatdar Pravinjay Pandit had passed an order last week that the Kalsotsav festivities will be hosted by the Parab Gaonkar community. The other group, comprising Naik Gaonkar, Gosavi Gaonkar, Gawas Gaonkar and Karbotkar Gaonkar communities, had said that the mamlatdar’s order was one-sided.

“The celebration of Kalsotsav is the right of every community and not just the Parab Gaonkar community,” they said. Last year, the authorities had cancelled the festival, fearing a law and order problem.

MUMBAI: Speed limit on JJ flyover in south Mumbai has been increased to 60kmph, with a maximum of 35kmph on its curves, following repeated complaints of congestion. Speed limits on 10 other arterial roads have also been revised by traffic police in accordance with a notification issued by the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways (MoRTH).The MoRTH guidelines give an absolute limit of 70kmph in urban areas. So, traffic police have brought down the speed limit from 80kmph to 70kmph on the highways within Mumbai limits. Lalbaug flyover , Aurora bridge at Matunga and Jagannath Shankar Sheth flyover at Dadar have also been assigned a speed limit of 70kmph.“But on Marine Drive, we decided to assign a speed limit a little lower than 70kmph. This stretch is extensively used by pedestrians,” said joint commissioner, traffic, Madhukar Pandey. The maximum speed on Marine Drive has been fixed at 65 kmph.Data-backed research has shown pedestrian deaths declining at lower vehicle speeds, transport experts say. In Mumbai, pedestrians have been the biggest casualty of road crashes in 2017 and 2018. On JJ flyover, low speed limit of 30kmph ensured zero fatalities in 2019. “JJ flyover has dangerous curves that have claimed lives, particularly at Mandovi Post Office,” said an officer.However, Ranjit Gadgil of the non-profit, Parisar, said, “The upward revision of speed limits is completely unjustified. Speed not only increases the chance of a crash but also increases the severity.”Experts suggest doing a speed assessment on Mumbai roads before fixing speed limits. “In Bogota, Colombia, all historical crashes were mapped on arterial roads and this was followed by speed assessment at different times of the day under the Bloomberg Initiative for Global Road Safety... All the arterial streets had maximum speeds of 60kmph and these were reduced to 50kmph. Six months later, there was a huge difference. Twenty five percent road fatalities had fallen and travel during peak hours had increased by a mere 14 seconds,"" said Dhawal Ashar, transport planner with WRI India. In urban areas where potential conflicts arise between vehicles and pedestrians, fixing speed limits of 30 kmph can result in 90 percent chances of survival, he added.",mumbai,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74359986,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-242356,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/now-drive-at-60-on-jj-but-just-35-on-curves/articleshow/74346634.cms

Elephants of Guruvayur Devaswom bid adieu to Guruvayur Padmanabhan

THRISUR: Vivek Ramachandran along with his wife Vrinda Vijayan flew down from Abu Dhabi to Kochi on Thursday morning to attend a family function in Palakkad. But Ramachandran tweaked his travel plan as he wanted to catch a last glimpse of his ‘best friend’ — Guruvayur Padmanabhan .

Such was the popularity of the 84-year-old tusker, which died on Wednesday, that thousands of people from all walks of life poured into Punnathur Kotta , the elephant camp of Guruvayur temple, to pay their last respects to the most-revered elephant in state. People, with folded hands, were seen chanting ‘Narayana, Narayana’ as they paid rich tributes to Lord Krishna’s ‘favourite son’. With tears welling up, many realized that it was the last time they were seeing their beloved tusker. Education minister C Raveendranath, temple committees, organizations, establishments and individuals paid their last respects to the elephant.

Ramachandran said he was in a conference in Abu Dhabi when the news of Padmanabhan’s death reached him. “I have known Padmanabhan for 42 years. So, I was determined to see him one last time. As I caught up with the truck carrying Padmanabhan’s carcass, I felt like my best friend was being taken away,” said an emotional Ramachandran, who works in Swiss Bank, Abu Dhabi.

Thrissur wore a mournful look on Thursday with posters and flex boards bearing the photos of Padmanabhan appearing across the city and outskirts. Guruvayur Devaswom chairman K B Mohandas said other elephants belonging to Guruvayur Devaswom and the security guards of Punnathur Kotta gave a ‘guard of honour’ to Padmanabhan.

“Punnathur Kotta witnessed huge flow of crowd after the news of Padmanabhan’s demise spread. When Padmanabhan’s carcass was taken to the elephant crematorium at Perumthode under Malayattoor forest division, hundreds lined up along the route and offered floral tributes,” Mohandas said. He said the devaswom will honour Padmanabhan by installing his statue on its premises. “The administrative committee will soon take a decision in this regard,” he said.

At Perumthode, a group of veterinarians led by Dr Divakaran Nair, prof (retd), Veterinary College, Mannuthy, conducted the postmortem.

Assistant conservator of forests, Thrissur, P M Prabhu, said, “Presently, forest department has taken the tusks of the elephant. After completing official formalities and on getting the order of chief wildlife warden, they would be handed over to Guruvayur Devaswom.”

242,['28/02/2020'],State to explore brackish water aquaculture parks,"This story is from February 28, 2020

Chennai: With marine exports touching 1.16 lakh tonnes and shrimp being a major contributor, Tamil Nadu aims to expand brackish water aquaculture sector with a feasibility study in six months at the potential sites across coastal districts.

Realising that there is plenty of unused fallow land unsuitable for other purposes, the government is now planning to develop shrimp farming in these areas. The state has a potential area of 56,000 hectares of brackish water resources in the form of estuaries, backwaters and creeks. At present, 1,892 brackish water farms are registered.

There is a considerable growth of shrimp farming in the state since early 1980s with Penaeus monodon and Penaeus indicus as the major culturable prawn species.

After coastal aquaculture authority was set up and the rules covering the shrimp farming sector in addition to introduction of Specific Pathogen Free Penaeus Vannamei (white legged shrimp), has turned shrimp farming into a major commercial enterprise as it is a major seafood export earner.

The feasibility study will identify the revenue details of the unused fallow lands suitable for aquaculture, create a land bank, identify high potential zones with requisite hydro biological and chemical parameters and create a roadmap. ""The aquaculture parks will be more like a SIPCOT model (for industries), where we will be providing basic infrastructure and people can invest. It will have brood stock management and a hatchery,"" said fisheries director G S Sameeran.

The Central Institute of Brackishwater Aquaculture (CIBA) has begun a study on coastline mapping for aquaculture and submitted reports for the districts of Tiruvarur, Thanjavur, Cuddalore, Villupuram, Pudukkottai and Tuticorin. The CIBA study found that hardly 10% of the potential area has been developed for brackish water aquaculture. The resource mapping used tools like remote sensing, GIS, and physical parameters like salinity and nutrient value. There are vast unused resources which are yet to be tapped for development of sustainable aquaculture.

Once established, the parks will see shrimp and other diversified culture varieties of commercial importance such as sea bass, cobia, silver pampano, milkfish and bivalve culture in accordance what’s suitable for the site.

Essential infrastructure facilities required to develop the parks, such as common water intake and drainage reservoir, effluent treatment plant, power, pre-processing facility and laboratories will be identified by the authorities. ""Identification of land is of utmost importance given the pollution caused by aquaculture wastewater,"" Poovulagin Nanbargal’s G Sundarrajan said. With its 1,076km long coastline, the state is also planning to frame a policy for land leasing to see a holistic growth in brackish water aquaculture.

Artist’s impression of the new statue

VADODARA: A new statue of Dr Bhimrao Ambedkar will be installed at Race Course Circle at the corner of the GUVNL Crossroads better known as Ambedkar Crossroads. While Vadodara Municipal Corporation (VMC) mulls new installation, activists are concerned about the dignity of the existing statue as a flyover is being constructed over it.

The flyover from Genda Circle to Manisha Crossroads is passing over six crossroads. These include the Ambedkar Circle located at the junction of the R C Dutt Road and Racecourse Circle. Representations were also made by activists to the VMC asking the civic body to ensure that the statue did not lose its prominence.

Sources in VMC said that there were two opinions regarding the statue. Some suggested that the statue should be moved to a different location near the existing place while others suggested that it should be covered with an ornate decorative structure like a ‘ chhatri ’.

Eventually, the civic body has made up its mind to come up with a new statue with the small replica of a parliament at the corner of the junction itself. Land is available near the government quarters there.

VMC deputy mayor Jivraj Chauhan said that the idol will also be new.

“Architects have already made designs for the project that will come up in a space of around 2,000 square meters. Different artisans have submitted their work and rates for the idol too. The land where the project is being planned was allocated to VMC in 1984. Some minor procedures are pending and will be completed shortly following which work can begin,” said Chauhan.

Chauhan added that the existing statue will be shifted to the Ambedkar Museum coming up near Kalyannagar or any suitable place. “It will be painted and refurbished again,” said Chauhan.

Thiruvananthapuram: The city police have decided to install barricades on Kowdiar–Vellayambalam stretch to reign in the menace of speeding that has been leading to frequent accidents.

City police commissioner Balramkumar Upadhyay has taken the decision following the latest accident on the stretch near Manmohan Bungalow on Wednesday night.

The strategically-placed barricades are expected to cut down the speed of the vehicles ahead of the dangerous curve near Manmohan Bungalow on the stretch that has become an accident-prone zone.

A car had crashed into the electric pole that stood on the median at the junction near Manmohan Bungalow on this stretch on Wednesday around 9.30pm. Five youths, who were inside the car, had sustained injuries. Among them, the condition of a 17-year-old youth, Amodh, is reported to be serious as he sustained injuries on the head. It is alleged that the car was racing with another motorcycle when it lost control and met with the accident.

“The decision is sure to cause much inconvenience to motorists, but we have no choice left when motorists misuse the freedom and engage in dangerous racing on the road,” said Upadhyay. Wednesday night’s accident was the third one on the junction near Manmohan Bungalow this month. Two weeks ago, two cars had rammed the electric pole on the median on the same spot in a span of 12 hours. The accidents occurred on February 10 and 11 respectively.

Meanwhile, as usual, the police have not been able to find out the circumstances that led to the accident as the surveillance cameras installed at the junction were not functioning. This revelation contradicts the claim by the police that all cameras in the city surveillance network were repaired in October last year ahead of the by-election in Vattiyoorkavu constituency.

The repair works were initiated following strong criticism after the police failed to secure any visual evidence of the movement of the car allegedly driven by IAS officer Sriram Venkitaraman causing an accident that claimed the life of journalist K M Basheer in August last year.

Upadhyay said that it was indeed true that the police had carried out maintenance works of the cameras. But it was done through private agencies and not through Keltron. Some of the cameras failed to function as they were imported and spare parts were not available here.

“The government is set to replace the existing surveillance network with a new and improved one under the Smart City project. The works in this regard are expected to commence soon. Hence the department does not wish to spend more money on repairing the old cameras,” said the city police commissioner.

The city police have around 240 cameras in its surveillance network. At present not even half the cameras are functional.

Speaking to media in Nellore, Somireddy said chief minister Y S Jaganmohan Reddy is afraid that Naidu will expose the CM’s land deals in Visakhapatnam.

He asked Jagan to show his mark in development instead of spreading factional politics. “Naidu’s detention is illegal and undemocratic. It is a total failure of the government to provide required security to the opposition leader’s tour in north coastal region,” said Somireddy.

Yanamala Ramakrishnudu, opposition leader in legislative council, slammed the police for working at the behest of YSRC leaders. “Naidu is loved by people of Vizag as they knew well as to how he recreated the city after getting it thoroughly damaged in Hudhud cyclone.

They did not come for the lunch at noon and local residents started searching for them. Later, Kunji and Devu were found dead in the farm and a snapped electric line was found near them, Irinjalakuda police said.

After the inquest, the bodies were shifted to Irinjalakuda taluk hospital for postmortem.“We suspect that the women workers accidently touched a snapped broken electric line and it caused the death. A case was registered under section 174 of CrPC and the probe is on,” said a police official.

Mazdoor dies while repairing service wire

A KSEB employee was electrocuted at Thaliparamba in Kannur district on Thursday. P P Rajeevan was a mazdoor in the section office in Thaliparamba.

The mishap happened at 12.45pm when he was repairing a service wire to a house near Trichambaram temple after switching off the line. But when Rajeevan was repairing the wire, he suffered electric shock and died.

According to KSEB officials, the electric power flowed to the service line from the inverter in the house, which remained on while he repaired the service line. However, this could be confirmed only after a detailed examination, and the officials from the Electrical Inspectorate have started a probe, the officials said.

They also said the officials would investigate if there was any other reason that caused the mishap.The body was shifted to Government Medical College, where autopsy would be conducted on Friday.

KSEB worker suffers head injuries from fall, dies

A 46-year-old worker of KSEB died after he fell from an electric pole after he reportedly got an electric shock at Mavelikkara here on Thursday. The deceased has been identified as Kamalahassan of Cherthala, and the incident took place near Government LP School, Puthiyakavu, Mavelikkara.

Circle inspector B Vinodkumar said they have not confirmed whether he died due to electric shock or not. “He suffered severe head injuries after falling from the pole. We did not see any burn marks that normally happen due to the electric shock. We can confirm the exact cause of his death after an autopsy to be held in Alappuzha Medical College Hospital on Friday,” the circle inspector said. He leaves behind his wife Moly and children Sethulakshmi, Ashtapathi and Adarsh.

Nagpur: ICSE’s language exam comes with a valuable time management guidelines by the board which is helping students to pace their exams well. Every question in English exams (there are two papers) comes with an advice to students about how much time they should be spending on it.

The most recent example is the English-1 exam where every question came with a clear mention of the suggested time limit. CISCE board, popularly known as ICSE which is the name of its Std X certificate, clearly mentioned, “Do not spend more than 30 minutes on this question” on top of question number one.

This pattern was followed throughout the paper in all five questions. Students were advised in each question about the maximum minutes they should spend on them.

Kenneth Mendonca, principal of Chanda Devi Saraf School, said “This has been a trend for quite some time in language papers. No doubt, it is of immense help to students because this gives them a clear idea on time management during the crucial board exam.”

A few state board academicians say this is something which should be implemented by other boards as well. Ashok Gavhankar, a senior academician, said, “In board exams, it is all about time management. Many times children get nervous and are unable to time themselves leading to anxiety when they enter the last 30 minutes.”

Indira Gandhi National Open University (Ignou) does something similar during its exams where it tells candidates the expected length of answers. P Sivaswaroop, regional director of Ignou, said “We give approximate word limit so that students do not spend too much time on a particular question and struggle with the others.”

This also eliminates the problem of students devouring extra answersheets in the misguided belief that writing long answers will get them more marks.

The court said it was a “necessary party” given the nature of prayers made.On Wednesday, Delhi Police had come under fire before a bench of Justices S Muralidhar and Talwant Singh, which had taken a dim view of delay in booking Kapil Mishra , Parvesh Verma and Anurag Thakur.Justice Muralidhar was transferred late on Wednesday to Punjab and Haryana high court, days after the Supreme Court collegium made the proposal.When Solicitor General Tushar Mehta repeated the arguments on Thursday, adding that police had decided to defer registering FIRs for now “looking at the complexity of the situation”, the Chief Justice-led bench agreed to grant four weeks for a reply to be filed.Mehta said, “The paramount concern should be welfare of citizens. Not all are present before the court. Even they are suffering.” He maintained that the authorities had examined all the audio/video clips and other materials, including that on Twitter and “after having carefully considered all these materials, a conscious decision was taken to defer the decision on the question (of lodging FIR).”However, the AAP government standing counsel Rahul Mehra urged the bench to issue urgent directions in view of the seriousness of the situation in northeast Delhi and pointed out that “the court had asked why FIRs regarding hate speeches were not lodged when FIRs for other offences had been registered.” Mehra added that 48 FIRs had been registered for deaths, arson, loot and other offences committed in that area.Senior advocate Colin Gonsalves , who appeared for petitioners Harsh Mander and Farah Naqvi, urged the court to keep up the pressure on police to take action, arguing there is “hatred in the air” due to the alleged hate speeches and “it had resulted in deaths, arson and looting.” He submitted that an FIR must be lodged immediately and “these people should be arrested and taken off the streets.”During the hearing, senior advocate Chetan Sharma also mentioned a plea by Lawyers Voice, which wants FIRs against Congress president Sonia Gandhi, Rahul Gandhi and others for allegedly giving hate speeches. “Why did people come out on streets during President Trump’s visit?

262,['28/02/2020'],Museum &amp; med college areas to become no-vending zones,"This story is from February 28, 2020

Thiruvananthapuram: The city corporation has decided to declare the area near the main entrance of Medical College, premises of dental college, entrance of Museum and area in front of Museum police station as no-vending zones. The decision, which was made by the town vending committee (TVC), was approved by the corporation council during the meeting held on February 13.

TVC decided to make the area in front of Museum as no-vending zone considering the historical importance. The town planning committee has also received the approval of corporation council to prepare a city street vending plan (CSVP). The expression of interest will be invited from agencies for preparing CSVP.

The corporation plans to rehabilitate authorized street vendors from areas declared as no-vending zones to new vending zones. An area in Chalakuzhy was earlier identified by town planning committee to rehabilitate vendors from the entrance of Medical College. However, this is likely to be revised in accordance with Kerala street vendors (protection of livelihood, regulation of street vending and licensing) scheme, 2019.

The museum and zoo department has recently forwarded complaint to corporation regarding the functioning of street vendors in front of Museum entrance.

As part of CSVP, the vending zones, restricted vending zones and no-vending zones shall be identified based on volume of traffic, number of pedestrians passing through the street and potential of the area of the street. Vending zones will also be determined based on intensity of footfall, road width and density of vehicular and pedestrian movement. Restricted vending will be linked with road width; for instance there will not be any stationary street vending on road having width up to 3.5 metres. The number of street vendors shall be decided by considering holding capacity of each designated vending area on such road.

TVC will also classify vendors as stationary vendors, mobile vendors and mobile vendors using motor vehicles. The vending fees will be determined for three categories based on area; upto 10sq.ft, 10-25sq.ft and more than 25sq.ft. The scheme also has provisions to cancel the certification mainly in case of sub-letting of licenses, a problem which has always remained unaddressed within corporation limits.

Corporation has so far done two surveys of street vendors. As per the first survey, 1,881 vendors have been identified of which 554 persons have been issued ID cards. License has not been distributed to any of the vendors so far. Around 1,599 vendors were identified in the second survey. Certain conditions have also been laid down for issuance of certificate. The vendor shall not have any other means of livelihood and he/she should not vend in any other place and shall not lease, rent or sell the certificate to others.

I was there during the outbreak of SARS in early 2003 and saw how well Singapore manages epidemics there. But things are very different this time around.Lee Hsien Loong, prime minister of Singapore, has said the possibility of a recession looms over Singapore with the coronavirus outbreak already hitting the economy more severely than what SARS did 17 years ago.I can myself feel the pinch big time now. For eight years, I have been into film distribution. Now, my business is severely affected because people are hardly watching movies there. A film, which would earlier have made a certain amount of dollars in a day, doesn’t get that collection even in 10 days.I came to Kolkata in December and was supposed to go back in January. But I met with a small accident and I had to stay on till early February. By then, the news of the coronavirus outbreak spread. Since my work involves meeting people from all walks of life, especially across South East Asia and China, I was advised by doctors to stay back in Kolkata till the situation came under control. Since my work demands me to continuously meet people at cafes and other places, I am susceptible to the virus.With no options left, I have settled for meetings over Skype and phone. However, these interactions are not equivalent to face-to-face meetings. So, it has affected me professionally. I was supposed to attend the Hong Kong Film Festival. But now, that, too, has been postponed from April to August-end.Tourism has also been hit badly. Even the business of the cargo guy, who handles all my film consignments, is in doldrums.The biggest issue is that the attack isn’t even detected early. The Singapore airport is the most easily accessible and prominent one in this region. I fear I can contract the disease from travellers at the airport. Even if I reach Singapore and have to return to India for some work, I might have to go through a quarantine period. That will again impact my work. Keeping all these in mind, I have decided to stay back in Kolkata till at least the end of March.(Sen is a film producer and a distributor who lives in Singapore)",kolkata,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-47529300,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-110164,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/recession-may-hit-spore-due-to-outbreak/articleshow/74326091.cms

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Electrocution due to snapping of live overhead power lines may come to an end if the pilot implementation of Moulded Case Circuit Breaker ( MCCB ) by KSEB in Thiruvananthapuram district proves successful.

At present, there is no proven technology or device that can be used as a tripping mechanism on power distribution lines. “Most of the unfortunate electrical accidents involving public happens when they accidentally touch upon live power lines. The higher capacity lines, 11KV and above, have tripping mechanism so that they would go dead the second they snap. But in the case of low tension distribution lines that criss cross the entire state, there is no tripping mechanism, other than the fuses. But on most occasions, snapped wires remain live and pose threat to lives. It’s in this context that the board has decided to test on pilot basis a Smart MCCB that a private manufacturer has offered for use in distribution lines,” KSEB director (system operations and safety) N Venugopal said.

Spectrum Infra Ventures (P) Ltd has demonstrated operations and functionalities of the system as the part of their smart distribution and power management system at Vydhyuthi Bhavan in November last year. During the demonstration, the company had claimed that Smart MCCB has many advantages over the traditional switch gears and have special features, including automatic cut off of the outgoing LT supply of distribution transformer or LT distribution line whenever a heavy fault occurs in that line. It could be operated remotely and can be used as a monitoring and auditing system for electrical parameters of the line.

“The Smart MCCB may reduce the electrical accidents to public and animals and may improve safety and quality of supply. However, technical feasibility of this equipment can be asserted only after conducting necessary test on a trial installation or pilot project on a selected LT distribution network at a selected area. If the system proves effective, KSEB would certainly use the same throughout the distribution network so that unfortunate deaths can be avoided,” Venugopal said.

The private company has been given permission to install the MCCB system at their own cost in one of the remote LT distribution networks under Nedumangad electrical division. The company is expected to start the pilot programme in another few weeks.

VADODARA: Members of Vadodara Book Sellers Association have threatened to surrender their licenses if the state government does not reverse its decision to allow sale of textbooks from school only.

The education department earlier this month notified that schools will have to sell textbooks with QR code to students directly and have banned books published by private publishers. Schools will get a commission of 12.5% on sale.

Association said they will lose their business and the current stock which they hold will be rendered useless.

In Vadodara district alone, book sellers have a stock of textbooks worth at least Rs 5 crore. “We will not be able to sell these textbooks as now onwards textbooks with QR code will have to be used,” said an office bearer of the association.

On Thursday, while addressing the media the association members said that if the government will not withdraw its decision, they will surrender their licenses. Students studying in schools affiliated to state government board use textbooks published by Gujarat State School Textbook Board.

269,['28/02/2020'],"Indian Navy to induct 24 multi-role choppers in early 2021, ENC to get 12","This story is from February 28, 2020

Visakhapatnam:The Indian Navy is set to induct 24 MH-60R Multi-Role Helicopters (MRH) worth around $2.2 billion through foreign military sales. Half of these helicopters — that is 12 — will be stationed at Visakhapatnam under the Eastern Naval Command (ENC) while the remaining 12 will be with the Western Naval Command (WNC). The delivery of the helicopters is likely to begin early 2021.

The move comes at a time when the Indian Ocean Region is witnessing increasing security threats due to proliferation of submarines.

The helicopters can be employed for offensive and defensive roles, including anti-submarine warfare, anti-ship strike, low-intensity maritime operations, search and rescue, over the horizon network-centric operations and electronic warfare.

These helicopters are a replacement for the Sea King 42/42A helicopters, decommissioned in the 1990s, and envisaged to operate from frontline ships and aircraft carriers providing them the critical attributes of the flexibility of operation, enhanced surveillance and attacking capability.

A spokesperson from the ENC said, “The acquisition, which is worth about $2.12 billion, was approved by India’s top defence clearance body, the Cabinet Committee on Security, which is headed by the Prime Minister. We can expect 12 of them for ENC while the other 12 for WNC.” The acquisition of MH-60R as envisioned in the ‘Capability-Based Perspective Plan’ provides the Indian Navy with a key capability and contributes to the Make in India initiative.

As part of the Indian Navy’s commitment to the ‘Make in India’ initiative, the OEM (original equipment manufacturer) M/s Lockheed Martin would also be discharging offsets through the transfer of technology to Indian offset partners for the manufacture of products and services. This would enable the absorption of niche technology, skill development and manufacture of eligible products or services leading to a generation of employment, skilling of MSMEs and indigenous production of products for buy-back by the OEM.

270,['28/02/2020'],Aadhaar &amp; pension: Another milestone for her,"This story is from February 28, 2020

Kollam: Bhageerathi Amma of Prakkualam in Thrikkaruva gramapanchayat in Kollam continues to be in the limelight. She excelled in the equivalency exam conducted by the State Literacy Mission at the age of 105 and got mentioned in Prime Minister Narendra Modi's monthly ‘Mann Ki Baat’. Now, she will secure an Aadhaar card and will become eligible for welfare pension .

The Times of India had reported her great achievement by appearing for the equivalency exam. In that report, it had been stated that she was not yet considered for old age pension citing that she had no Aadhaar card to claim the benefit.

The Aadhaar registering authority had once tried to collect the data. But, owing to her old age her fingerprints could not be taken and iris scan could not be conducted successfully. Citing this the grama panchayat authorities were denying her social security pension.

Following the TOI report, Bank of India Niramankara branch officials told TOI that they would take extra effort to go to Kollam and try to record her biometric details.

As her inspirational success story got figured in the Prime Minister’s Mann Ki Baat on the other day, the bank officials got excited and they came to Kollam on Wednesday. As they alerted the UIDAI authorities in Bengaluru they took over the system and tried to remotely record the details. But, as they found it difficult to record her fingerprint and iris scan they allowed the Aadhaar enrolment staff of the bank to record it on their own.

Bank of India team led by manager P Prasanth, assistant manager N Riyaas, Aadhaar enrollment supervisor Anukiran and technician Soumya recorded the details. “Aadhaar card would be readied in four–five days,” said Anukiran.

“Mother was disappointed over not receiving the pension citing absence of Aadhaar card. Now, she is happy that she could get the social security pension,” said Thankamani Amma, daughter of Bhageerathi Amma.

KB Vasanthakumar, the literacy mission key resource person said it was the most prestigious moment for him in his 30-year-long association with the literacy movement.

“With the Prime Minister himself recognising her achievement, the Aadhaar authorities were also enthusiastic about granting her the card,” he said.

Hearing about the Bank of India initiative, Corporation Bank Thrikkaruva branch officials came to her house and opened her savings account.

Thrikkaruva gramapanchayat president K Chandrasekhara Pillai said the panchayat would complete the formalities on the day she received her Aadhaar card to grant her pension. Her literacy trainer S N Shirley was also present.

VADODARA: At a time when cable television is almost on the brink of becoming history, city seems to be witnessing a fresh cable war.

In what appears to be an attempt to retain existing customers , a cable television operator in Manjalpur area of Vadodara has been giving new set-top boxes and additional number of channels to its customers. While sources claim that this may be a strategy to stop people moving onto other television platforms including DTH and fibre optic network, it is being done illegally and allegedly for ‘personal gains’ only.

However, to restrain this operator and also other operators from indulging in such illegal competition in cable business, Den Networks Ltd and Fortune (Baroda) Network Pvt Ltd (FNPL) have moved court against nine cable operators in Manjalpur. These nine operators hold 49% in FNPL holdings. The nine cable operators and Den Network Ltd had formed FNPL as a joint venture (JV) company in 2008 to provide cable television services in Manjalpur area. While the agreement signed at the time of forming the JV restrains any competitive business by any of the parties, one of the cable operators – Kirit Patel – started promoting cable television services of New Delhi-based Infiniti Television and Telecom Pvt Ltd, and also Indore-based ACN Digital Pvt Ltd in the city. “The cable operators, who are the shareholders, cannot engage in any competing business directly or indirectly as per the agreement so what has happened so far is a clear breach of it,” said FNPL and Den Network’s advocate Jaideep Verma. He added that the court has admitted the petition and had also served notices to the respondents. The next hearing will take place on March 2.

According to the case presented by FNPL and Den Network, Patel assured customers and other cable operators that the two competing companies’ services are trustworthy and better compared to FNPL’s and Den Network’s. He even got set-top boxes changed without the customers’ permission. Earlier the cable television subscribers had Den Network’s set-top boxes but after Patel’s collusion with the competing companies, the customers got set-top boxes of ACN Digital Pvt Ltd.

The petition states that Patel colluded with the New Delhi company and became its director. The New Delhi company is a majority shareholder in the ACN Digital.

VADODARA: It’s curtains for the historical Deepak Open Air theatre located in the Madanjhampa Road area.

After refurbishing the theatre at a cost of Rs 5.5 crore with added facilities designed by the Institute of Indian Interior Designers (IIID), the Vadodara Municipal Corporation (VMC) finally decided to raze parts of the new additions to help a community hall come up at the site now.

The theatre, considered as part of the city’s history was renovated in 2009 under VMC’s golden goals. But the project hit roadblocks right from its inception. First the contractor who was awarded the renovation work gave up the project. He was blacklisted and after much efforts another agency was identified to complete the work.

The refurbished theatre was eventually inaugurated in 2015 amid much fan-fare. This too proved to be short-lived as there were hardly any bookings for cultural events.

The renovated theatre got three bookings in 2016-17 and just one in 2017-18.

Congress corporator Balasaheb Surve in whose ward the theatre falls along with others started arguing that the facility should be used for some other purpose. It was suggested that it should be given to people for holding functions like marriages.

Discussions regarding identifying some alternative use for the facility began last year and it was eventually decided to redo the theatre again with minimal expenses so that it could be used as a community hall. The budget for the ensuing financial year also included the work.

Standing committee on Thursday cleared a proposal to raze some parts of the theatre.

The VMC plans to raze two of the four food stalls, the security cabin, rooms added behind the stage and the amphitheatre-like sitting arrangement with rooms below it. A kitchen will be made behind the stage and an existing hall will be extended. Two counters for serving food will also come up.

“We want to ensure that the changes are done with minimum expenses. The space was lying unused and with the changes it will be utilised and will also generate some revenue for us,” said VMC standing committee chairman Satish Patel. The agency demolishing the parts of the facility will also pay Rs 2.51lakh to VMC.

COIMBATORE: A fire broke out at the Vellalore dumpyard of the Coimbatore City Municipal Corporation on Thursday morning.

Personnel of fire and rescue services rushed to the spot and controlled the fire by around 4pm. As many as six fire engines, 12 water tankers, four earthmovers and 60 personnel worked together to bring the fire under control. Smoke had spread to neighbouring areas such as the Podanur-Chettipalayam Road.

Corporation commissioner J Sravan Kumar said they controlled the fire by late afternoon. “But there is still smoke and we are trying to put it out completely. It was just a small fire and we were able to control it as we reached there immediately,” he said.

The fire could have been caused by the rising temperature and the presence of methane generated in the yard, Kumar said. “The fire had broken out in one heap. As we had compartmentalized the yard, it did not spread. It was well within an acre.”

Activists, meanwhile, said the yard flaring up has almost become an annual affair now. They said the civic body only reacts to the incidents of fires, but doesn’t take proactive measures to prevent them.

Organizer of the Vellalore dumpyard opposition committee J Daniel Jesudass said there has to be a permanent provision for putting out fire at the dump yard. “We have been asking authorities to station five fire engines at the yard. It has not been done. Considering the frequent incidents, a fire sub-station should also be set up there,” he said.

Last year, there were two major fires at the 650-acre dump yard one in March and another in August. In the March incident, fire had spread over 80 acres and a chopper from the Sulur Air Force Station was deployed to extinguish it.

Khan said, “Strict action should be taken against leaders who are instigating riots with their inciting speeches. Besides, action should also be taken against those policemen who were found helping rioters, as shown in some videos uploaded on social media.”

Condemning attacks on religious places, Khan said, “The Constitution provides for the protection to religious places and structures, but rioters damaged religious sites in Delhi in presence of police. In the prevailing atmosphere, it seems that our mosques are not safe, which is a matter of concern.”

The organisation demanded compensation and jobs for the families of those who were killed in the violence. Organisation members said a delegation would visit the violence-hit areas in Delhi, soon.

Thiruvananthapuram: Until now, tribal people in 27 settlements in Kuttichal panchayat had to travel for around 20km to buy ration items from the four ration shops located in Kuttichal Junction. But, they will not have to go through this ordeal anymore, thanks to the effective intervention of the civil supplies department.

On Thursday, civil supplies minister P Thilothaman conducted district-level inauguration of mobile ration shops for marginalized and people living in secluded forest areas.

The inauguration was held at Mannamkonam at Kottoor in Kattakada. K S Sabarinadhan, MLA, presided over the function. Kuttichal panchayat president G Manikantan, Vellanad block panchayat president S S Ajithakumari, civil supplies secretary P Venugopal and district supply officer Jalaja G S Rani among others attended the event. Heads of tribal settlements were honoured at the function.

The minister said that all eligible tribal persons will get ration. “In addition to mobile ration shops, possibility of setting up a ration shop at Podiyam in Kottoor will be explored,” the minister said. He also promised to take steps to renovate the Kottoor–Mannamkonam Road.

District supply officer Jalaja G S Rani said that the project was rolled out in Kuttichal considering the number of tribal people in the area.

“There are around 495 tribal families spread out in 27 settlements in the area. Often, they come together as a group to buy ration items from around four ration shops located at Kottoor Junction. Some have to spend around Rs 300 for the transportation alone. While the Anthyodaya ration cards make them eligible for 30kg rice and 5kg wheat free of cost, many of them skip visiting ration shops due to the tedious travel,” said Rani.

The district supply officer said that tribal promoters and rationing inspectors will fix a day for bringing the ration items in a tipper trucks to the areas. “The mobile ration shop will visit two-three areas in the locality so that people of various settlements can purchase items,” the officer said.

Bareilly: Reading out a satire at a function organised to celebrate the trade tax department’s foundation day on Wednesday didn’t do any good to an employee of the department but instead landed him in trouble.

In his self-written satire, Prem Singh, 45, allegedly first targeted Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav and then took a dig at Prime Minister Narendra Modi, which left officials red-faced.

Soon after, officials asked him to leave the podium and he was sent on leave on disciplinary grounds. On Thursday, the headquarters issued his suspension orders.

A function was organised at the zonal office of the trade tax department where the employee recited the couplet.

Additional commissioner of trade tax Mukti Nath Verma said that when principal assistant Prem Singh’s turn came, he started reciting some couplets on a lighter note but it was completely out of reference.

He added, “His choice of words were highly inappropriate and we immediately asked him to stop reciting the poem and leave the podium.”

Traders were also in attendance at the function and they opposed to the employee’s poem. They demanded strict action against him for using objectionable words for the PM.

Notably, Singh also holds the post of district unit general secretary of UP Ministerial Staff Association and according to sources he was appointed on compensatory ground after his father’s demise.

A senior official on condition of anonymity said, “Since he is not a highly educated person and didn’t join the department through any competitive exam, he is not aware of certain things.”

Meanwhile, on Thursday BJP workers reached the trade tax office and demanded the sacking of the employee. Additional commissioner told TOI, “We informed the headquarters in the morning about the incident and by the evening we received his suspension orders.”

Jaipur: Even a few years ago, people in Chirawa block in Jhunjhunu district were facing health problems due to the presence of excessive fluoride in groundwater. Today, with smart usage of water and its conservation, lives of people have drastically changed making them healthy and self-sufficient.

With the help of NGO Ramkrishna Jaidayal Dalmia Sewa Sansthan, people living in 88 villages of Chirawa block have built 20-feet deep soak pits in their houses to collect waste water from kitchen and bathrooms that flow into the ground and help in recharging groundwater.

Head of Shivpura Gram Vikas Samiti Sanjay Sharma said in addition to making soak pits, they have also started rainwater harvesting. “We dug a ‘kund’ or pit in every house to store around 20,000 litres of rainwater from the roofs. When the kund overflows, water is collected in a pond dug far away from the house through a connection. The water from the pond is used for farming,” said Sanjay.

In all, around 3,400 kunds have been constructed in the Chirawa village till now.

The villagers have now moved towards low water crop farming. Bhupendra Paliwal, the project manager of Ramkrishna Jaidayal Dalmia Sewa Sansthan, said they had made people to understand about the usage of low water farming.

“Earlier, farmers used to grow onions, cotton or wheat and needed a lot of water. We asked them to switch to mustard, barley and gram. We have installed piezometers in villages to calculate the level of groundwater in the region and for how many years it will be sufficient. Many signboards were installed in villages to generate awareness about water usage,” said Bhupendra.

Convincing villagers about rainwater harvesting and need to conserve water wasn’t easy. Vikram Katewa, a member of Raghuveer Gram Vikas Samiti from Raghuveer village, said initially people were apprehensive about it.

Vikram explained, “When NGOs approached us, we called a village meeting to discuss the plans. No one agreed, but after some persistence, they agreed to build three kunds in the village. Looking at the fruitful results after monsoon, people were ready to spend to construct kunds.” He said before water harvesting, villagers were suffering from dental fluorosis and joint pain after 40 years of age. “A 40 year-old used to look like a 60-year-old. The older generation of the village still have yellow teeth but the younger generation is healthier. This gives us relief,” said Vikram.

Vijayawada: The state government on Thursday told the Andhra Pradesh high court that petitions seeking cancelation of the government decision to allot 1251.5 acre land in capital villages for affordable houses scheme was unconstitutional.

Advocate general Sriram argued that the petitioners were merely obstructing to government schemes. He said the petitioners’ argument that the government schemes will change demography in the capital city area was unconstitutional.

The AG said that the petitioners were objecting to the government’ decision of allocating house pattas to the weaker sections. He said the petitioners had maintained silence when the earlier government undertook a housing programme for the weaker sections in 2017.

The AG argued that the state government has been vested with the power as per the constitutional obligation under Part IV cases. “The petitioners cannot decide who has to be their neighbours and we are only following the scheme that was followed in 2017,” he said.

The AG informed the court that the distribution of house pattas will be held on Ugadi.

The HC bench headed by chief justice J K Maheswari questioned the AG on what grounds the government had alloted land to the weaker sections in Amaravati when it is not implementing APCRDA Act and developing Amaravati. He also asked the AG to file a counter.

Further hearing will take place on March 4.

VADODARA: The forest department has arrested a man who was trying to sell two elephant tusks in the city. Vinayak Purohit, a resident of Subhanpura, was nabbed after forest officials received information about his plans to sell the tusks. The forest officials set up a trap and sent a decoy customer to meet Purohit on Wednesday.

The meeting was arranged at the house of Vinoo Darbar who is a friend of Purohit. As soon as Purohit showed the tusks, forest officials raided the spot and nabbed him. They also seized the tusks that weigh about 2.5 kilograms each and are three-and-half-feet long. Purohit wanted to sell them off for Rs 1.5 crore.

Forest officials questioned Purohit about the source of the tusks. “He claimed that the tusks were part of his family’s ancestral property. He said that his grandfather had brought the tusks from Africa in 1964. But we are verifying his claims,” said Nidhi Dave, range forest officer, Vadodara. Forest officials suspect that Purohit, who works as a driver, may be part of some gang that deals in elephant tusks or he may be connected with poachers too.

When asked why he wanted to sell off the tusks suddenly, Purohit couldn’t give satisfactory reply to the forest officials. The tusks will now be examined to ascertain if they are authentic. While Darbar is absconding, a local court has sent Purohit to judicial custody.

Divulging details, superintendent of police Abhishek Dixit said the accused, along with his family, who had been living on the temple premises for over past 10 years, was envy of Saran for the prominence he was given by the temple management committee in the affairs of the temple.

“According to Chandra, the committee, Balaji trust, had given him ultimatum to leave the temple by March. This filled him with vengeance as he was set to lose his service due to Saran. Meanwhile, on Tuesday morning, when Saran allegedly refused to give the key of toilet to Chandra an argument ensued between them, following which Chandra and his two sons hacked Saran to death and the trio, along with other family members fled the temple on motorcycles,” said the SP.

“They used to wander from one place to the other in a bid to evade arrest. However, they were arrested from Bhandaria Crossing in Bilsanda on Thursday morning, and sent to jail,” the SP added.

PILIBHIT: The Allahabad high court has issued an order to the Uttar Pradesh principal secretary (home) to appear before it in person on March 5 for not filing a counter affidavit in compliance with the court's previous order dated January 20, 2020, in the matter related to the 1994 custodial death of seven Sikh TADA prisoners in Pilibhit jail .

A division bench of Justice Sudhir Agarwal and Justice Rajiv Mishra issued the order on Wednesday while hearing an impleadment application filed under Section 482 of CrPC by 12 petitioners, including families of seven TADA prisoners killed in Pilibhit district jail on the intervening night of November 8 and 9, 1994.

According to one of the petitioners, Asad Hayat, a senior high court lawyer, the impleadment application was filed with the objective of challenging the notification of the UP government dated January 17, 2007, by virtue of which Section 321 of CrPC was invoked to withdraw all criminal cases against the accused personnel of Pilibhit jail, including the then jail superintendent Vindhyachal Yadav.

The government notification of January 17, 2007, came despite the CBCID (crime-branch crime investigation department) filing a chargesheet against 41 jail officials and police personnel on January 24, 1995. Following the CBCID chargesheet, only one jail constable, Anokh Singh, was arrested and sent to prison but he later managed to get bail, Hayat said.

After the UP government’s notification, the chief judicial magistrate at Pilibhit passed an order on March 30, 2007, for withdrawal of all cases against the jail staff. In fact, the government’s notification was antithetical to the order of the then principal secretary of jails issued in January 1995 granting sanction to prosecute the then jail superintendent, said Hayat.

As many as 28 TADA prisoners lodged in barrack number 7 in Pilibhit prison were brutally beaten up by the jail staff on the intervening night of November 8 and 9, 1994, on the charge that they had attempted to escape. On the morning of November 9, six of the prisoners were brought dead to the district government hospital while one seriously injured prisoner, Vichitra Singh, was referred to King George’s Medical College (KGMC) in Lucknow, but he succumbed to his injuries on November 21.

An FIR against the jail staff, including officials, was lodged at Pilibhit Kotwali police station by then Samajwadi Party district president Gyani Trilochan Singh, in which one of the petitioners, Haroon Ahmad, was made a witness in the case.

Their expressions showed their immense happiness at the novel venture by Sahapedia and Mookh Badhir Mandal.

“The Indian Heritage Walk Festival is being organized for the past three years and Sahapedia invited me to organize it in Ahmedabad. This year I decided to keep such walk in Vadodara that also has rich heritage,” said Avni Varia who organized the walk.

“I always like to reach out to people with physical disabilities, mentally challenged as well those with special needs. They also love our heritage and want to learn more about. So I decided to design a walk for the hearing and speech impaired people here,” Varia added.

The heritage walk began at 3 pm from the Egyptian gallery of the museum. While museum curator, Vijay Patel explained the importance and history of every artefact, Trushna Shah, who works at Mookh Badhir Mandal, translated it in sign language for these special Barodians. The group was keen to know more about Harappa civilization and the ceramic vessels kept in the Chinese gallery.

Work underway for drinking water project in Jaisalmer district

JAISALMER: Indira Gandhi canal project in the desert districts of Jaisalmer and Barmer districts is proving to be a boon, with drinking water being available in these parched areas.

Currently, different projects are going on to provide water to many villages in Jaisalmer and Barmer districts through Pokaran-Phalsoond-Balotra-Siwana lift canal.

Amid the tough sand dunes and rocky areas, PHED in western Rajasthan has laid big diameter pipeline of one of the two much awaited drinking water schemes (368 villages) in October 2019 and the second scheme (195 villages) is expected to be completed by 2021. With these schemes, 12.68 lakh people of 563 villages in Jaisalmer and Barmer districts will get drinking water.

So far, Rs 1569.33 crore has been spent on this scheme. The scheme of the water works department will ensure a permanent solution to the drinking water problem for these villages.

Additional chief engineer of the project Rakesh Jain said, “The work of two drinking water projects worth Rs 1,500 crore is at the final stage. The projects proposal were conceived in 2007 while the first sanction for financial sanction came in 2011. The work started on these two projects in 2012-13.’’

Water is being drawn from Indira Gandhi main canal RD 1253 Nachna. Till now, Rs 1,559.33 crore has been spent. The beneficiaries include armed forces posted in the area and will also fulfill the water demand for refinery being set up at Pachpadra.

Jain said it was a big challenge for the PHED to complete the works of both projects. The 300-km long project is now on the stage of completion.

294,['28/02/2020'],Firms warm up to green ways on Kovai-Tirupur belt,"This story is from February 28, 2020

Coimbatore: Many companies in the Manchester of South India are beginning to go green. At least 20 companies in the Coimbatore-Tirupur belt have got GreenCo ratings in the past two and half years, and another 20 companies have applied for ratings and are in the process of being evaluated, according to data with the CII’s GreenCo mission.

They attribute this trend to many multinational clients based from the United States and Europe looking only to employ environment-friendly companies.

The GreenCo mission was launched by the Confederation of Indian Industries in 2012 to make industries improve their efforts to save natural resources. While Greenco rating system was launched in the country in 2012, and Brakes India’s Sholingur unit became the first company from Tamil Nadu managed to get Greenco rated in 2013, the western region seemed slow to wake up to the trend. While Kirloskar Brothers got its manufacturing unit in Karumathampatti certified in 2014 along with the rest of their units, the rest of the region seemed to jump on to the bandwagon in 2017. “It was around 2017-’18 that Coimbatore-based industries like LMW, KG Fabrics and many garment exporters in Tirupur began applying for GreenCo ratings and achieving them,” counsellor for the climate change and environment sustainability division of CII, Chennai, Hirin Prashanth said.

Of the 20 companies that have got Greenco ratings in Coimbatore-Tirupur belt, five of them are from Coimbatore. “In and around Tirupur, there is a surge in garment manufacturers applying for the ratings, because many of their buyers and clients from Europe and the US have begun asking for environment sustainability certificates from their suppliers,” Prashanth said. At least another 20 companies are in the process of being certified in the belt, he said.

Applying for GreenCo ratings involves showing your company’s efforts to become more environment friendly in the last three years and efforts taken after applying for the rating. “We have teams to first train the company on ways to become more environment-friendly and then six to eight months later, an assessment team to assess their improvement efforts. It includes changes like fitting pumps with more energy efficient motors, fitting water efficient taps, setting up a sewage treatment plant, reducing overall energy consumption, among others,” Prashanth said.

Speaking at the one-day conference on Green Manufacturing conducted by CII on Thursday, chairman of the CII GreenCo forum Unni Nayar said currently 285 companies across the country are rated and certified. “We target increasing the number to 1,000 by 2022,” he said. He also said it was encouraging to see many public-sector units like the railways, getting their units like the Integral Coach Factory in Perambur, green certified.

Coimbatore: Burglars who broke into a cooperative credit society in Anamalai here on Tuesday night had to leave empty-handed after they failed to open the locker using a blowtorch.

The miscreants had gained entry into the Primary Agricultural Cooperative Credit Society at Marappagoundenpudur after removing a window grill, a police officer said. “The locker contained 180 sovereigns of gold ornaments and Rs 8 lakh in cash.”

As many as 300 customers, mostly farmers, are members of the society, which provides gold loans and agriculture loans. After failing to open the locker, the burglars sprinkled sulphas, a pesticide, inside and outside the building so that sniffer dogs won’t be able to follow their trail.

Employees, who opened the building on Wednesday around 9.30am, were alerted by the pungent odor of the pesticide. “They found the mangled grill and the damaged locker, and alerted the Anaimalai police. Society secretary Sharmila Banu lodged a complaint,” the officer said.

A police team consisting of fingerprint experts, scientific officer and cybercrime cell members inspected the crime scene. “The burglar alarm did not trigger when the burglars attempted to break open the locker. Also, the images of the burglars were not recorded in the CCTV system. The security guard was sleeping in his room when the incident happened,” the officer added.

COIMBATORE: After decorating some of the city’s iconic buildings like the Coimbatore Medical College and Hospital and the library building of the police commissioner’s office, New Delhi-based St+art Art India Foundation is in the city to decorate the walls of the Tamil Nadu slum clearance board’s tenements at Ukkadam.

The foundation has sent Amitabh Kumar from Bengaluru, Avinash Kumar from Jharkhand , Jeeva from Coimbatore and Chifumi from France to beautify the walls.

The theme is ‘The People and Environment of Ukkadam and Coimbatore’, said director of special projects Vikas Nagrare. “The artists began work on Thursday. Unlike our 2018 project, which mainly depicted people of Coimbatore and was painted on walls, which were tall and most visible in the heart of the city, this project called Ukkadam Art District Coimbatore aims to depict the essence of a location, which includes its environment, festivals, lifestyle, people and their professions,” he said.

The artists spent a lot of time researching the Ukkadam area by observing the lifestyle, meeting people and watching their activities. “Our paintings will depict the Ukkadam Periyakulam and maybe some more lakes and the life around them. We plan to depict the migratory birds visiting the district, which is a popular nesting spot for pelicans,” said Nagrare. “Our interactions with people showed that Ukkadam has a large migratory population, as many displaced people settle there. They will also be depicted. Our research is an ongoing process, with our artists continuing to roam the city and conceptualize their art.”

The artists of the foundation, when they were in the city in 2018, had spotted Ukkadam as a probable location to create an art district. “But the idea materialized after they were invited for a beautification project recently by the city corporation. An art district is basically a campus, where people walking or driving through can get to see a lot of life-size art,” Nagrare said.

The artists will be painting the four walls using wall paints sponsored by Asian Paints. “ The corporation had invited the artists over to beautify the slum tenements. Wall arts will create a sense of pride among the residents and motivate them to keep the area clean. Maybe, one day, it could become a tourist attraction,” president of the Residents Awareness Association of Coimbatore (Raac) R Raveendran said. “Wall art is one measure but we plan to increase greenery and cleanliness also.”

The artists will finish their work by March 15.

298,['28/02/2020'],3 held for student’s murder 2 yrs ago,"This story is from February 28, 2020

Pune: The arrest of a suspected thief, Wasim Khan (30), on Tuesday led the Kondhwa police to the chance detection of a civil engineering student’s murder in 2017.

The student, Nikhil Londhe (24), had left home on the night of August 27, 2017, following a fight with his parents. They had scolded him for spending too much time on his cellphone.

During interrogation, Wasim revealed that he and his three aides — Imran Shaikh (20), Ahmed Khan (25) and Shahrukh Khan (19) — had robbed and murdered Londhe the same night. They had spotted Londhe near Central building and forced him into a stolen autorickshaw, police said. They drove him to a secluded spot at Shivnerinagar in Kondhwa where they robbed him of his cellphone and documents before bludgeoning him to death with a stone.

Londhe’s body was found the next day in a badly mutilated condition. He could not be identified because parts of his face had been eaten by stray dogs, the police said. The police had seized a blood-stained stone from the spot.

On September 19 the same year, Londhe’s father, Anil, who was then posted as a havildar at the Yerawada central jail, lodged a complaint with the Vishrantwadi police regarding his son having gone missing. However, the police did not link this complaint to the unidentified, mutilated body found at Kondhwa. The murder case remained unresolved till Wasim’s arrest and interrogation.

Senior inspector Vinayak Gaikwad of the Kondhwa police told TOI, “We have also arrested Imran and Ahmed following Wasim’s confession. The fourth accomplice, Shahrukh, was murdered in a separate incident last year.”

The police have now established that the mutilated body was Londhe’s after recovering a photocopy of his father’s identity card from one of Wasim’s friends living in Yeolewadi. “Wasim said he had told his friend to destroy the documents that they had robbed from Londhe. The friend told the police that while he had destroyed most of the documents, he had retained the identity card. We then contacted the Yerawada jail authorities who said Londhe’s father had been transferred to the Visapur jail,” Gaikwad said.

The Visapur jail officials told the police that Anil Londhe had retired from service and gave his contact number. “When we contacted him, he told us of the ‘missing person’ complaint he had lodged in September 2017. He and his wife visited our police station on Wednesday and broke down on hearing that their son had been murdered. They identified him from his photographs, clothes and a friendship band tied on his hand,” Gaikwad said.

Inspector Mahadeo Kumbhar of the Kondhwa police said, “The Sassoon general hospital had kept the victim’s viscera and DNA sample after the autopsy. We will match the DNA sample with that of the victim’s parents at a forensic lab.”

Anil Londhe told TOI over the phone, “I have nothing to offer as comments for now. You may speak to my lawyer, Mahesh Kakade.” Kakade, when contacted, said, “We are yet to receive complete details about the incident. We won’t comment anything for now.”

Gaikwad said police had received information about Wasim during a check on criminals involved in vehicle thefts. “Wasim and his aides had stolen several vehicles. We recovered five stolen vehicles from him. The four decided to kill Londhe fearing that he might register a robbery complaint and provide their description and the registration number of their vehicle,” he said.

Police have registered an offence of kidnapping, robbery, murder and destruction of evidence, among others.

301,['28/02/2020'],Shivajinagar among 3 areas with bad air in cool weather,"A view from Shivajinagar area in Pune.

PUNE: You may want to steer clear of Shivajinagar, Bhosari and Bhumkar Chowk while travelling in Pune and Pimpri Chinchwad.Air quality in these three locations has become 'poor' for the first time this year, as per pollution data from the city-based Institute of Tropical Meteorology's (IITM) System of Air Quality Forecasting and Research (SAFAR).Track the pollution level in your cityA health advisory issued by IITM for these locations on Thursday said, “Increasing likelihood of respiratory symptoms in sensitive individuals. Children and elderly are at risk. Everyone may begin to experience some level of discomfort. People with heart or lung disease, older adults and children should reduce prolonged or heavy exertion.”Lead pollutant—particulate matter (PM) 2.5— levels in these three places have touched a high recently, especially with the sudden drop in minimum temperatures, experts said.On Thursday, the minimum temperature in Pune was 12.1 degrees celsius, among the lowest this month. The sudden dip in night temperature as well as increase in pollution is already starting to trouble those having a sensitive immune system, and those prone to respiratory infections, doctors said.A source from IITM told TOI that the last few days have witnessed a sudden dip in night-time mercury to around 12 degrees celsius, which has been one of the causes of a spike in the level of the main pollutant PM 2.5.“When this pollutant’s concentration is high and reaches ‘poor’ levels, it automatically leads to a worsening of the air quality, making it poor. A fall in temperature causes the planetary boundary layer height to come down. A low height indicates strong temperature inversion and downward air motion which favours the near-surface accumulation of pollutants like PM2.5 and PM10 emitted from local sources,” the IITM source said.Shashikant Nehul, a research scholar in the department of environment of Savitribai Phule Pune University, told TOI that many chowks in the city like Swargate, Nal Stop, and areas in Pimpri Chinchwad and Bhosari, and several others are currently also witnessing high PM 10 levels, around 1.5 times higher than the maximum permissible limit of 100 micrograms per cubic metre (µg/m³).“Areas like Shivajinagar, Bhosari and Bhumkar Chowk are relatively more congested, with high vehicular traffic and construction activities which are major sources of pollution. This coupled with a fall in night temperature prevents the dispersion of pollutants, causing the air to be more polluted,” Nehul added.IITM-SAFAR data also showed that pollutant PM 2.5 concentration in these areas was the highest on Thursday in comparison to the last few days.",pune,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74385203,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-178641,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/shivajinagar-among-3-areas-with-bad-air-in-cool-weather/articleshow/74347221.cms

303,['28/02/2020'],Age-old water wisdom still rocks in rural Rajasthan,"This story is from February 28, 2020

A view of Badli talab in Jodhpur

JODHPUR: Technology definitely makes life easy, but people in rural Rajasthan still swear by traditional ways of water conservation in the form of ‘nadis or johads,’ ‘beri’, ‘tankas’ and ‘talaabs’ which date back to a few hundred years.

‘Nadis or johad’ as they are called in different parts of the desert state are waterbodies, which have large catchment areas or ‘aghors’ where water is accumulated during monsoons and is used by locals for their daily needs.

The ‘naadi’ in Bhagtasni village near Jodhpur, which is around 200 years old as claimed by locals, is one such example of water conservation. It is not only existing, but is a crucial part of villagers’ life.

Hukum Singh, a 70-year-old who has been taking water from this nadi since childhood told TOI, “My father used to speak about this nadi and how they would take water from here when he was a child. We still use the water from the nadi, which fills up during monsoon and lasts till the next season. Till 15-20 years ago, the water was used by us for drinking, but now we now use it mainly for livestock. When the nadi was created, the science behind it was simple — to have a large area where rainwater flows from the mountains and is collected.”

Similarly, tankas and beri, which have water throughout the year, are still the main sources of water for locals in an age when almost every household also a has a water pipe connection.

Tanka is a small rainwater collection structure in rural houses. A circle shape structure with slope towards its centre, water runs off to the centre and fall into the tanks below. When needed, the water is taken out from a narrow lid, usually enough to drop a bucket into the tank. This water, depending upon the capacity of the tank, is enough for 6-7 months.

It may differ in design, but the objective is to gather rainwater from around the tank and route it to fall into the tank.

Beris are small well-like structures built in the bed of a pond or ‘nadi’ and fulfill the water needs after the pond or ‘nadi’ dried up. They contain water for longer period than the pond as water charged into the ground, keep filing the beris by way of seepage.

Bhawar Lal, who is the priest at a temple near the ‘talaab’ in Guda Bishoniyan village said, “The talaab in our village is around 500 years old and even today is used by the villagers for fulfilling their water requirements. The basic aim was to have an area large enough to collect the rain water. Even if the pond would dry up, water would get stored in the numerous beris which were dug up in the catchment areas. Even today, we maintain it and clean it regularly. They never dry up and since the water is hard in these parts, the water stored in the beris is still used for drinking. Every household also has tankas where water gets stored and is used for daily consumption.”

Not only are these waterbodies a source for survival, but are also tied to the religious mindset of the entire village community. Vikram Singh from Barli village claimed that the all these bodies not only fulfilled their need for water, but also were also considered pious. “Most talaabs and nadis have temples on their banks. They are just not a source of water but sacrosanct for everyone. Water and worship go hand in hand.”

Azam and his kin surrendered before a court in a forgery case related to his son’s fake certificates

RAMPUR: Azam Khan ’s tryst with prison goes way back to the days of Indira Gandhi’s Emergency – 45 years ago. Though, in those days he was a young student activist locked unceremoniously in a prison cell initially for 20 days which, in his own words was “like a grave”. He continued to remain in other prisons for 17 months.

Fast forward to 2020, the student activist is now a senior Samajwadi Party (SP) leader and Rampur MP – with a distinction of being a nine-time MLA to his credit. On Wednesday, Azam and his kin surrendered before a court in a forgery case related to his son’s fake certificates and sent to jail with much fanfare and media attention.

During the Emergency (1975-77), Azam was general secretary of Aligarh Muslim University (AMU). Slapped with the draconian Maintenance of Internal Security Act (MISA), he was jailed for 18 months in Aligarh and Varanasi.

Narrating those Emergency days, Azam had said, “I was sent to jail during the Emergency because I was against the Congress ideology. A resolution was passed by students’ union that no Congress leader will be allowed to enter the campus as Mrs [Indira] Gandhi was scheduled to visit the university.”

He continued, “I was locked inside the cell for 20 days which was like a grave. It was a dark room without sunlight. Later, I was transferred from Aligarh to Varanasi Central Jail where I remained for more than 17 months.”

Azam, who had completed his LLB in 1974 and elected as general secretary of AMU students’ union in 1975, was thrown into prison in July 1975. Like thousands of other political leaders and activists, he languished in prison until January 1977. In March, he contested the elections from Rampur city Vidhan Sabha seat on a Janata Party ticket, and lost.

During his second innings in prison, 45 years later, the former Uttar Pradesh minister has been sent to jail on allegations of forgery. The SP leader has also been booked under several cases which include ‘book theft’, ‘goat and buffalo theft’ and land grab. On Wednesday, Azam said, “I am not a foot soldier, I am a warrior.”

Nagpur: Underworld don Arun Gawli has been granted parole for the eighth time after being convicted on August 3, 2012, for the murder of a Shiv Sena MLA. The Nagpur bench of Bombay high court allowed his application on Thursday to attend to his ailing wife Asha.

A division bench comprising justices Sunil Shukre and Madhav Jamdar, while quashing the divisional commissioner’s decision to reject the gangster-turned-politician’s application for parole, directed respondents to release him within a week of receiving the HC order copy. The divisional commissioner and Nagpur Central Jail superintendent were respondents in the case.

Gawli, also referred to as ‘Daddy’, had first applied for parole to divisional commissioner to attend to his wife, who would be undergoing surgery. However, it was rejected on the grounds that his presence many lead to law and order situation in Mumbai. He then approached the judiciary through counsel Mir Nagman Ali for 45 days leave under same provision.

Ali contended that on all seven times the noted don was released on either parole or furlough, he returned before the deadline and there was no breach of any condition.

Opposing his contention, the government pointed out that being a gangster, there is every possibility that his return may lead to law and order situation in Mumbai and peace in his Dagdi Chawl area would get disturbed. A long list of crimes allegedly involving him that included some serious ones were also submitted to the court.

The judges, however, observed that there is no basis to the government’s arguments as there is no record that petitioner had jumped sanctioned leaves or committed any breach of conditions in all these years.

Gawli, who was convicted for the murder of MLA Kamalakar Jamsandekar along with 11 others, was awarded rigorous life imprisonment in 2012 and is undergoing the sentence in Central jail here since then. Last year too, the HC had granted furlough to Gawli in March.

310,['28/02/2020'],Pune: Court upholds PCB’s property tax levy on multiplex in Fatimanagar,"Representative image

PUNE: A district court has upheld the Pune Cantonment Board ’s (PCB) right to fix the Annual Rateable Value (ARV) of commercial properties operating from leave-and-licence rental premises, on the basis of their annual gross rent instead of the estimated cost of building and land value.Sunita Kinkar, the PCB’s lawyer, told TOI on Thursday, “The judgment holds significance vis-à-vis issues of property tax assessment involving commercial properties operating from rented premises in the Pune cantonment area.”District judge Deepak D Almale on February 24 dismissed an appeal by Fame India Limited, which runs a multiplex from a 28,250sqft rented premises that is part of a commercial complex in Fatimanagar, against the PCB’s order of March 29, 2011, that fixed the ARV of this premises at Rs1.18 crore by considering annual gross rent for the period 2008-2011.Based on it, the PCB later issued a property tax bill of over Rs32 lakh to Fame India for the period between April 1, 2010, and March 31, 2011.The ARV forms a critical benchmark for the assessment of property tax against the rent, at which a land or building is reasonably expected to be let-out from year to year. The PCB revises the ARV after every three years. The value, so fixed, applies to each of the three years for the purpose of assessment of property tax bill.In its appeal filed in October 2011, Fame India contended, among other things, that the PCB ought to have assessed the ARV of its premises as per the provisions under Section 73 (a) of the Cantonment Act, 2006, by taking into account the estimated cost of building. As against this, it argued that the PCB “illegally assessed” the ARV under Section 73 (b) of the Act by considering the annual gross rent and did not extend apt opportunity for hearing objections and filing of submissions.The PCB denied all these arguments and said the leave-and-licence amount was of Rs9.88 lakh per month and by multiplying this amount with 12, it was correct in fixing the ARV at Rs1.18 crore for a year.Judge Almale referred to the March 29, 2011, order wherein the PCB had assessed the ARV of the appeal premises under Section 73 (a) of the Act at Rs16.95 lakh, taking into account one-twentieth of estimated present cost of the building and land value appertaining thereto and further assessing the ARV under Section 73 (b), according to gross annual rent, at Rs1.18 crore. “There are recitals in the order that assessment arrived in view of Section 73 (b) is more beneficial to the interest of the board, therefore, the same is recommended,” the court observed.The judge cited the ARV definition and observed that Section 73 (a) was applicable only to hotels, colleges, schools, hospitals, factories and any other building that the CEO decides to assess under this clause. “The appeal premises being a multiplex theatre does not come within the ambit of Section 73 (a) of the Act. The respondents (PCB) ...... have opted for Section 73 (b), to my mind, the said action is neither illegal nor contrary to the provisions of the Cantonment Act,” the judge held.Kinkar told TOI, “We brought to the court’s notice that the legislature’s intent was quite clear from the fact that the term multiplex was not included in Section 73 (a) of the Cantonment Act, 2006 and, hence, the other option was under Section 73 (b).

Water harvesting at a village in Chirawa block in Jhunjhunu district

UDAIPUR: The esteemed model of rainwater management at Udaipur lakes is over four centuries old. It was the ancestral vision of wise rulers that led to a creation of a unique inter-connected micro-system of river diversion and linkage. Prominent lakes such as Pichhola, Fatehsagar, Udaisagar and Badi were built in such a way that overflow from one was not wasted as it flowed into another, thus providing a year-long water storage system to quench the thirst of residents.

It was the visionary rulers of Mewar who created a system of lakes to meet the water requirement of the citizens, claims Pushpendra Ranawat , a retired professor of geology.

In his book ‘Wah Udaipur Wah,’ Ranawat elaborated, “Pichola is a lake behind an earthen dam constructed by a Banjara in the 14th century. Height of the dam was raised to increase the capacity of the lake. Additional water resource for the new capital was created through the construction of Udaisagar Lake, east of Udaipur. Its work started in 1559 and was commissioned on April 4, 1565. The needs of the growing city during the next two centuries were met by converting the pre-existing Pichola from a small pond (talai) to a large lake behind a masonry gravity dam-Badi Paal. Its capacity further increased through the addition of Amar-Kund, Rang Sagar, Kumbhariya Talab, and finally the northern most extension-Swaroop Sagar.” Lakes at Dewali and Badi constructed by Maharana Jai Singh helped Udaipur.

Fatehsagar has a very small catchment area of its own and is fed by Lake Badi, Chota and Bada Madaar. The overflow from Lake Bada and Chota Madaar merge with Ayar river. Ayar river feeds Udaisagar several kilometers downstream. The overflow from Lake Badi directly merges with Fatehsagar. The overflow from Pichol flows into Fatehsagar and the overflow from Fatehsagar flows into the Ayar through a canal before it enters Udaisagar. Below Pichola and Fatehsagar are numerous wells and bawdi (stepwells), which were the only source of drinking water back then. With this web of lakes and wells, most of the rain falling within the Udaipur basin was kept within the basin itself, with very little losses making it a remarkable rainwater harvesting system.

Maharana Fateh Singh enlarged Dewali pond to Fatehsagar Lake (1889) which is now a major source of water and recreation for Udaipur. He also constructed Madar I & II lakes north of Udaipur to provide water to Fatehsagar.

In 1931, water supply through gravity pipelines from Swaroop Sagar launched for Udaipur. In 1944, SAV Consulting Engineers was commissioned to prepare pipewater distribution system for Udaipur-a totally new concept for Udaipurites. In 1945, the water of dug-wells downstream of Pichola were chemically analyzed and found potable.

To the delight of the public, 20 public taps were installed for the convenient supply of water near their homes - the birth of Public Works Department .

However, with the hike in population, about 70 ghats, over hundred hotels and some six thousand houses located on lake slopes, these waterbodies are under constant threat of degradation.

Inaugurated by M Vallalar, managing director, Aavin, in the presence of district collector J Innocent Divya, the dairy centre at the Poomalai commercial complex in Charing Cross in Ooty will be manned by a self-help group comprising five transgenders.

P Babu, project director, Tamil Nadu State Rural Livelihoods Mission (TNSRLM), said the self-help group was floated with an objective to help transgenders find more acceptance in the society. “We wanted to encourage them socially and morally.”

Pointing out that at least 10-12 members were required to form a self-help group, he said, “This is a special group with just five members.”

While the centre has been set up at a reduced cost by the Aavin management, TNSRLM has rented out the space at the Poomalai commercial complex to them at a minimal rent.

“We have also arranged them a loan of Rs 5 lakh from the district cooperative bank towards working capital,” Babu said.

Sowmya, one of the group members, said, “We are happy that the Aavin management, district administration and TNSRLM project director have come forward to encourage us and help us enhance our lifestyle.”

Pune: The CCTV cameras helped the Wakad police identify the registration numbers of the bikes used by the Pune aides of the interstate ATM thieves’ gang, leading to the arrest of six men, including the kingpin who would fly in from Delhi to execute the crimes.

“After two consecutive cases of ATM thefts in Wakad, we began checking the CCTV cameras and lodges in the area. One of the CCTV footages helped us identify the registration number of bikes used by the suspects,” the Wakad police said.

During probe, Sandip Salve (43) of Mulshi, Dattatreya Kokate (42) of Thergaon were taken into custody following a tip-off received by assistant inspector Harish Mane. “During questioning, they admitted to their involvement in ATM thefts in the Pimpri Chinchwad areas. They also revealed the names of other gang members, including the kingpin, Azaruddin Tahir Hussain, from Haryana,” senior inspector Vivek Mugalikar said.

He said a police team comprising Mane, sub-inspector Siddhanath Babar, constables Bapusaheb Dhumal and Nitin Dhoraje, among others, then went to Haryana and nabbed one of the gang members, Sarfuddin Hasim. “The team also created network of informants in Haryana to gather information about the remaining suspects,” Mugalikar said.

Assistant inspector Mane said around this time, the gang kingpin, Hussain, came to know about the arrest of his accomplice from Haryana and told his Pune accomplices to go underground. “The duo were already in our custody and talked to Hussain as per our instructions. They told him that they would be coming to Haryana and requested Hussain to pick them up from the New Delhi airport,” Mane said, adding, “After reaching Delhi, we took Hussain into custody.”

The officer said after the news of his arrest spread, the remaining gang members went underground. “We spread the news that the police team had returned to Pimpri Chinchwad. This is when third suspect, Mohammed Shakir, came out from his hideout and was arrested,” Mane said, adding, “The third Pune accomplice, Gautam Jadhav (38) from Thergaon, was arrested later.”

He said Hussain and his accomplice Hasim used to swap the debit cards at the ATM kiosks to dupe people of their monies.

“When people became more alert, they shifted their focus on cutting ATMs. About two years ago, Hussain came into contact with Kokate at an ATM kiosk in Thergaon and took him in the gang for cutting ATMs,” Mane said.

BAREILLY: An inter-faith couple from a village under Aonla police jurisdiction, who had married against the wish of their families around a year ago, took to social media on Thursday seeking police protection claiming that the woman’s relatives have threatened to kill all of them, including their eight-day-old son.

The couple, in their early twenties, alleged that even though they had approached the local police seeking protection, no action was taken against the woman’s family due to which they have been living in fear ever since. As a last resort, the couple shot the video at an undisclosed location and circulated it on social media on Thursday.

The woman said, “I married a man from a different community on my own last year. I am quite happy with my marriage. However, my relatives are unhappy and are threatening to kill me, my husband and our newborn. Even though we had approached the police, they did not provide any protection.” Meanwhile, her husband said that his family members were beaten up by her relatives, adding that they were now threatening to kill the entire family. “I respect all religions and we decided to lead a life together as we love each other. However, we have been facing great threat since the day of our wedding. We request the government as well as the local administration to provide us security. If anything happens to any of us, the government and police will be responsible for it,” he added.

Refuting allegations of police inaction, Aonla station house officer Sunil Kumar said that action was taken under section 107/116 of CrPC (pre-emptive action to prevent breach of peace) against the family of the woman. “Ever since they got married, the couple had been living outside the village. Only the man’s mother and brother live here. If the couple comes to the village and seeks protection, we will be provide the same to them,” he added.

AGRA: Wearing T-shirts at 8-11 degrees Celsius and drinking 2.5 litres were some of the measures that people resorted to in order to keep their body temperature normal so that they get clearance from Chinese authorities to board the IAF plane that has brought them back from Wuhan to Delhi on Thursday morning.Ashish Yadav (35), associate professor of photonic and plasmonic at Wuhan Textile University , and his 30-year-old wife, pursuing her PhD in computer science, were among the 112 people brought to Delhi from Wuhan by C-17 Globemaster of IAF.Narrating how they managed to get clearance to board the plane, Ashish said, “We had been warned by Chinese authorities that anyone with body temperature of over 37 degrees Celsius will not be allowed to board the plane. Therefore, at multiple locations, our body temperature was checked. Due to anxiety at one point, my body temperature rose to 37 degrees Celsius, and I was flagged by Chinese officials after which I drank several litres of water and wore only one T-shirt even when the temperature in Wuhan was between 8 and 11 degrees Celsius to bring my body temperature below 37 degrees Celsius.”“On Wednesday mid-noon, the Indian embassy contacted us and informed about the evacuation operation. At least 10 Indians and three Bangladeshi nationals were also flagged by Chinese authorities, after which the Indian embassy officials intervened and started negotiating with them. All the flagged passengers were given two hours’ time to bring down their body temperature to normal. We were asked to remain calm by Indian embassy authorities. Every passenger drank at least 2.5 litres of water. Finally, all were given clearance to board the plane,” said Ashish Yadav, who originally hails from Jalesar in Etah district, but lives in Agra city.Around 6:45 am on Thursday, the military cargo plane brought the couple, along with others Indians and 36 foreign nationals, to India.

The fire occurred on Thursday afternoon

VADODARA: Kitchen of a pizzeria in Nizampura was gutted after fire broke out due to leakage from an LPG cylinder on Thursday afternoon.

Leakage in one of the three operational gas cylinders led to fire when one of the employees ignited a stove. No staff member or customer at the restaurant was injured. Most of them rushed out as soon as the fire broke out. As flames started engulfing the kitchen, occupants of neighbouring buildings started sprinkling water to contain the fire until the firemen reached.

Fire department sources said that initial sprinkling of water really helped, as the fire did not spread further in the dining area of the restaurant. “When our staff reached there was thick smoke in the restaurant but we used self-contained breathing apparatus and sprayed water,” said fire officer Om Jadeja. He added that as fire was brought under control, efforts were made to remove the smoke using cross ventilation technique.

“There could have been a major disaster as there were 10 more LPG cylinders in the premises. Had these cylinders caught fire, the disaster would have gone out of control,” he added.

319,['28/02/2020'],VMC workers threaten to block assembly on Mar 18,"This story is from February 28, 2020

Vijayawada: Municipal workers threatened to block Andhra Pradesh legislative assembly on March 18 if the state government ignored their long-pending demands.

Sanitation workers and contract employees were on warpath on Thursday, demanding the Vijayawada Municipal Corporation (VMC) focus on the safety and healthcare of sanitation workers and ground-level staff. Hundreds of municipal workers staged a protest at Lenin Center in the city demanding VMC resolve their demands.

“Chief minister YS Jaganmohan Reddy promised to increase the salaries of sanitation workers. The promise has remained unfulfilled for months. Around 1,500 contract and DWACRA sanitation workers have been eagerly waiting for the payment of arrears. But VMC authorities are trying to escape and saying that the issue is pending with the state government,” said M David, secretary of the Municipal Workers Union (MWU).

Sanitation workers have been facing problem with the door-to-door segregated garbage collection. “Segregating garbage without gloves and other safety material is causing severe health problems. The VMC should give gloves, masks and other safety gear to every sanitation worker,” David demanded.

Municipal workers alleged that the door-to-door scanning machines are adding a huge burden on them. “Sanitary inspectors are insisting we scan each and every home after collecting garbage. It is taking much time. One sanitary worker is doing the work of four persons. We demanded that the VMC increase staff and our demand was unheard,” the secretary added.

CITU state leader and CPM state secretariat member Ch Babu Rao extended support to the municipal workers. “ The state government is confined to making promises. Contract workers in the engineering wing are receiving poor salaries. A driver with a heavy vehicle license is getting only Rs 15,000 per month. We are demanding the government implement a minimum salary of Rs 21,000 for every worker,” Babu Rao said.

“Municipal workers across the state are facing similar issues and we have decided to block assembly if the government turns a blind eye,” he added.

Saudi Arabia on Thursday indefinitely suspended visas for visits to Islam’s holiest sites for the Umrah pilgrimage, an unprecedented move triggered by coronavirus fears that raises questions over the annual Haj. The kingdom also suspended visas for tourists from countries affected by the virus as fears of a pandemic deepen.

Afzal Patel of Mumbai’s Atlas Tours and Travels said at any given point in time, there must be around 50,000 Indians among 5 lakh Umrah pilgrims in Saudi Arabia from across the world. Pilgrims are disheartened. “We are deeply saddened that pilgrimage had to be called off at the last moment,” said a pilgrim who arrived at Kozhikode airport to be told his flight had been cancelled.

Over 230 Umrah pilgrims from Kozhikode who were to travel to Saudi Arabia were sent back from the airport on Thursday.

While Haj, one of the five pillars of Islam, is an annual ritual, Umrah can be performed through the year. Lakhs do so every year, particularly during the Islamic months of Rajab, Shaban and Ramzan. Rajab, which set in a few days ago, marks the beginning of the peak season for Umrah.

Saudi Arabia, which so far has reported no cases of the virus but has expressed alarm over its spread in neighbouring countries, said the suspensions were temporary but it provided no timeframe for when they will be lifted.

“The kingdom’s government has decided to take the following precautions: suspending entry to the kingdom for the purpose of Umrah and visit to the Prophet’s mosque temporarily,” the Saudi foreign ministry said in a statement. “Suspending entry into the kingdom with tourist visas for those coming from countries where the spread of the new coronavirus (Covid-19) is a danger,” it added without naming them.

Haj and Umrah tour operators in India said they will incur huge losses. “Umrah pilgrims through my company leave for Saudi every day in a week and I have 500 pilgrims already in Saudi performing Umrah. We will face a huge crisis if the suspension order lasts long,” said Patel. “We have around 150 pilgrims in Saudi Arabia currently and another batch of 150 pilgrims was expected to fly out on Saturday,” said Yusuf Ahmed Khereda of Al Khalid Tours and Travels in Mumbai.

A disappointed P V Vijesh, manager at Al Hind Tours and Travels in Kozhikode, said they had been looking forward to a good Umrah season with around 400 pilgrims bookings every month. Baba Bhai Kolsawala, a tour operator from Mumbai, hoped the suspension of Umrah and visit visas would be revoked soon. Telangana Waqf board chairman Mohammad Saleem said he had put off his plans for Umrah in view of the virus threat. Salahuddin Ansari, officer on special duty on the board, said he and his family were to leave for Jeddah from Hyderabad on Friday. “Now, I have cancelled my leave and am joining duty,” he said.

Saudi Arabian Airlines officials, though, informed trade partners in the afternoon that passengers holding employment, work visit visas, business visit visas and family visit visas can be accepted for travel.

Though Saudi authorities have not specified the period of ban on Indian pilgrims for Umrah, in a separate circular the Saudi ministry of health has imposed restriction on travel and cancelled leave of employees in the Mecca healthcare cluster from March 15 to May 30. Imposing a ban on travel for those in Mecca cluster, the health ministry said except in urgent cases, travel outside the station should not be allowed.

Civic activists said that the PMC’s move is not public friendly

PUNE: The corporation will introduce the five-day week system for the municipal staffers from this Saturday.

The Pune Municipal Corporation ( PMC ) employees will have to work 45 minutes extra every day once the new schedule starts to compensate for the extra holidays. Staffers in emergency services of the civic body would be excluded from the system.

The PMC commissioner’s office issued a circular making the announcement on Thursday. “The civic employees will have to come 15 minutes before their scheduled arrival time and leave 30 minutes later than their prescribed departure time,” said the commissioner, Shekhar Gaikwad, in the circular.

The civic activists said that the PMC’s move is not public friendly and that it was taken only for the benefit of the civic staff.

“The PMC could have taken a different stand in this matter. They could have continued with the same system,” said Vivek Velankar of Sajag Nagrik Manch, a citizens’ group.

He said the salaried people, including the large workforce engaged in the information technology industry, residing in the city would be adversely affected by PMC’s move. Earlier, they could go and do the civic body-related works on Saturdays. But now, they would have to take leave to get the works done, he said.

He claimed that the online services of the PMC were very poor. So, it would be double whammy for common people,” he added.

The state government approved the five-day week system for all the state government employees, starting February 29. It will benefit around 22 lakh employees. Till now, the state government employees were getting offs on second and fourth Saturdays.

Once the five-day week starts, the working days will reduce to 264 from 288. The per day work hours will be increased from seven hours and 15 minutes to eight hours to compensate for the extra holidays.

Pune: Starting June 1, mithai shops will have to display the “date of manufacturing” and “best before date” for loose sweets kept in trays/containers or jars for sale.

Currently, it is mandatory to mention these details on pre-packaged sweets. The Food Safety and Standards Association of India (FSSAI) in its latest notification issued on February 24, said that this will be effective across the country from June 1.

""This is a significant step in safeguarding consumers' health and ensuring that they get value for money. In Maharashtra, we will initially focus on public education followed by strict action against violators,"" state FDA commissioner Arun Unhale told TOI.

Food business operators can decide and display the ‘best before date’ depending on the nature of the product, and local condition. ""An indicative list of shelf life of various types of sweets is given in the guidance note on safety and quality of traditional milk products. The list is available on the FSSAI website,"" said Dilip Sangat, assistant commissioner (food), FDA. "" This step will help consumers make an informed decision. However, there are chances of these dates being manipulated. Hence, some mechanism should be in place to ensure that there is no malpractice,"" said medical practitioner Abhijit More.

Senior paediatrician Sharad Agarkhedkar, former state president, the Indian Medical Association, said, ""Eating sweets long after they have been made may cause food poisoning or other complaints, including vomiting, nausea etc.""

The next 48 hours were living hell for them, as they remained hidden inside a dingy storeroom without food or sleep, waiting for help to arrive. They, along with two others, were finally rescued on Wednesday night and sent back home in Naoda, Murshidabad.

Kamal Shekh landed in Delhi a few weeks ago after he got a job at a fan manufacturing unit in northeast Delhi. His friends, who were already there, offered him to stay with them. “Things were alright till Monday afternoon. We heard about trouble breaking out in some pockets and decided to go home early,” Shekh said. As they walked towards Ghonda Chowk, tension had started building up.

“By the time we reached home, managing to dodge attacks or confrontations, it was late. The factory owner told us to leave the place immediately. The violence on the street intensified as the night progressed. We stayed up, fearing an attack any moment,” Shekh said.

As day broke, they crept out of their accommodation. “No one spotted us. We took shelter in a small room that the factory owner arranged for us. It was a storage space and there was nothing to eat. Once, we climbed on to the roof to see hundreds of people roaming the lanes, armed with bamboo poles and stones. We climbed back to the room and remained locked for the next two days. Each minute seemed longer than hours,” he said.

As they started calling up people, the first to respond was Bangla Sanskriti Mancha, a Kolkata-based organization. The Mancha members stayed in touch with them but could not enter the area as curfew had been imposed.

Tanmay Ghosh, secretary of the organization, said, “A few members took help from AAP leaders and JNU students for the rescue operation.” The news also reached Behrampore MP Adhir Chowdhury, who contacted MoS for home G Kishan Reddy. “Cops rescued us on Wednesday evening. We could breathe again only after we reached Delhi station,” Shekh said. Chowdhury tweeted: “We have made arrangements for their return and they will reach Kolkata safely...”

329,['28/02/2020'],New phishing tactic: Fake online transaction message,"Representative image

KOLKATA: Move over phishing calls and messages where fraudsters ask for your bank details posing as bank manager or as KYC update executives. The fraudsters have now started replicating messages sent by banks after every valid online transaction or every purchase using debit or credit cards, where they claim a large sum of money has been debited from your account and ask you to call at a number or click on a suspicious link if it wasn’t done by you. The moment you do so, you end up exposing yourself to a potential financial fraud where the fraudster may end up robbing your money with details you only share with them.Alerting citizens about the new method of phishing, Kolkata Police posted a detailed message on their Facebook page with three such examples. Within hours, the post was viewed by thousands of people and shared over 5,000 times. Hundreds of users commented on how they too received similar messages over the past few days.“The scamsters have changed the language and construction of sentence in the messages they send now. The messages look and read exactly like the valid SMS alerts from banks after every card or online transaction. They can cheat you with these fraudulent messages. Read the message carefully and avoid calling any number or clicking on the link if they seem even a bit suspicious,” said a senior officer of Kolkata Police.The post explains that these fake SMS alerts look very genuine. But when a bank sends an SMS, the last four digits of your account number remains visible while the rest are marked “X”. But in case of these fake text messages, all the numbers of the bank account are marked “X” as the fraudsters in most cases don’t know the exact account number.“The messages will ask the receiver to call up at some numbers to lodge a complaint if the transactions were not done by him/her. Please don’t be duped by such messages. If you receive such texts, immediately dial Lalbazar’s anti-bank fraud helpline number 8585063104,” said another officer.Schoolteacher Arijit Roy Chowdhury received a similar message last Tuesday. “The message looked genuine with a proper transaction ID. It said an amount of Rs 32,000 had been debited from my account from an ATM. I dialled the number mentioned and the person on the other end said he would note down my bank details for verification and ensure the money is back in my account within a week. He sought my card’s CVV number and other confidential details that alerted me and while still on the call I checked my account balance and it was intact. I realised it was a fraud and disconnected the call,” said Roy Chowdhury, a resident of Cossipore. Alerted by the cop post, a number of users also began posting screengrabs of the messages they received recently.",kolkata,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74375040,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-412718,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/new-phishing-tactic-fake-online-transaction-msg/articleshow/74347450.cms
330,['28/02/2020'],Phase 1 of farmers’ Aadhaar database to be ready by June,"This story is from February 28, 2020

Pune: The first phase of authenticating the Aadhaar number of farmers in the state with their landholdings, as part of a pilot project launched by the central government in November last year, is expected to be ready by June, agriculture department officials said.

From Pune, two talukas — Pune Khed and Shirur — were selected for the project covering ten villages. With the pilot completed, the process is now ready to be rolled out across the entire state, stated officials.

Nearly 11,000 beneficiaries of soil health card, PM-Kisan and crop insurance scheme from Pune district had their Aadhaar number authenticated with their landholdings.

The novel initiative entails setting up of a master database for implementing farmer-related government schemes and consolidating a genuine list of farmers. While the move is to ensure that the schemes are disbursed to authentic beneficiaries, states have the task to verify the landholdings of the farmers and submit the data. The creation of an authentic database of farmers with their landholdings and crop varieties produced by them will be one of its kind in the country, added the official.

Maharashtra is among the six states selected for the pilot, the others being Andhra Pradesh, Odissha, Uttar Pradesh, Tamil Nadu and Tripura. The remaining phase of the project is expected to complete by 2021.

“We expect the farmer database of nearly 6 crore farmers by June this year and the remaining farmers pan India by next year,’’ stated Union ministry of agriculture secretary Sanjay Agarwal. This will be used as a master database for implementing farmer-related government schemes.

With a database of beneficiaries of soil health cards, crop insurance scheme, PM-KISAN and other government schemes already in place, efforts will be made to link and integrate all databases and create one Aadhaar-authenticated data.

HYDERABAD: An unregistered, new school bus turned into a killer bus on Thursday when it snuffed out lives of two young students — siblings — at Yacharam when they were on their way to attend a function. The accused bus driver was taken into custody.

Their father B Ramesh, who was riding a motorbike, and brother suffered injuries when the school bus knocked down the bike. Police said Ramesh lost control of his bike when the bus swerved to the left all of a sudden. “He was blindsighted by this sudden turn, crashed the bike and fell down,” police said.

Ramesh’s eldest son Vivek (12), a class VII student, and the youngest son Gautham (6), an LKG student, died on the spot of severe head injuries. His other son Vishal escaped with minor injuries. Both Ramesh and Vishal, however, were shifted to a hospital.

“Ramesh’s bike was right behind the bus which was on its way to the RTO office for a registration. The bus took a sudden left turn without switching on the indicator, due to which Ramesh lost control,” Yacharam inspector M Madhu Kumar said.

The bus belongs to St Gregorios Public School in Yacharam. It was empty at the time (12.45 pm) of the mishap. The function hall was less than 2km from the accident site, police said. Ramesh is a lorry driver. Bus driver Mahipal Reddy (35) was booked under various sections of the IPC.

BENGALURU: Sleuths from Criminal Investigation Department ( CID ) arrested four men who cheated different banks by borrowing Rs 2 crore from them in the name of fake companies. Two of them were arrested earlier for cheating and human-trafficking.

The arrested are Uday Pratap, 48, of Arakere Layout on Bannerghatta Road, Ayub Ali, 42, Mahesh alias Madesha, 36, of Shivamogga and Ramegowda, 30, of Rajajinagar. Police recovered Rs 80 lakh cash, a new SUV and various documents, including fake Aadhaar and PAN cards from the quartet.

B Dayananda, additional director general of police, CID said the accused had opened accounts in 40 different banks in Bengaluru and Mysuru with an intention to cheat them. Six of these banks granted loans of different amounts to the accused.

Uday has 16 cases of human-trafficking pending against him, while Ayub, whose details are yet to be ascertained, faces five cases of cheating, where he had promised his victims medical seats.

CID SP ( cybercrime ) MD Sharath said the accused would open salary accounts in the banks. “First, they would open a bank account in the name of a fake company. Then, they would open salary accounts of their non-existent staffers. The accused furnished fake Aadhaar and PAN cards to these banks to open these accounts,” he added.

Over the next few months, cash would be deposited under ‘salaries’ category into these accounts and would be withdrawn from them. “Seeing a healthy transaction, the bank would extend loan facility to their employer-company. Uday and Ayub would introduce themselves as managing directors of the company and apply for loans,” said Sharath.

According to investigating officials, the accused would hire a small office premises for a few months. “When bank officials came for physical verification, the accused would take them to the office. The nameplate of the office would be changed when officials from other banks came visiting,” investigating officials said.

Trusting the accused, six banks granted loans to them, totalling to around Rs 2 crore, police said.

“The accused would pay the first six or eight equated monthly instalments (EMIs) before vanishing. They had two reasons for doing this: firstly, they’d empty their office and destroy all possible evidences during this time. Secondly, the banks would have penalised the agents or middlemen helping the accused, if no EMI was paid. The accused would continue their relationship with the agents to take their help in future, ” sources said.

However, the civic agency maintains eight of them are functional.The 17 mechanical sweepers were purchased for Rs 70 lakh a piece on February 8 and were an addition to BBMP’s existing fleet of nine such machines.The civic agency is drawing flak from citizen activists for spending lakhs of rupees on brand new mechanical sweepers but allowing them to gather dust in its parking lots. They suspect the Palike’s nexus with the garbage mafia is behind the vehicles lying in disuse.In a video uploaded on Twitter, Kavitha Reddy, a civic activist, is seen standing next to a line of mechanical sweepers parked in HSR Layout. She’s complaining about the vehicles gobbling up space instead of cleaning roads. Kavitha alleged BBMP wasn’t using even its old fleet of nine machines it had purchased in 2018. “It has been over two years and the mechanical sweepers are lying on a service road. They are not being used,” she claimed.BBMP officials said in all 17 machines, including eight new and nine old, were operating and the other new ones will be deployed by first week of March after they are fitted with GPS.“A few days ago, these mechanical sweepers were repainted and chief minister BS Yediurappa took a picture with them,” Kavitha said, adding the civic agency doesn’t want to keep the city clean as the garbage mafia doesn’t allow it.The mechanical sweepers are used only when a minister is visiting an area or a vehicle is launched, alleged Narayan K, another resident of HSR Layout. “BBMP claims to be cleaning roads at night but not a single one appears clean in the morning. The roads are full of dust,” he added.TOI spoke to a contractor about the machines he was supposed to operate not being used. He said councillors don’t allow mechanical sweepers to function in their wards. “When we take out the vehicles at night to clean the streets, councillors send their men and ask us to stop,” claimed the contractor. “They, in fact, harass us and even take away the keys,” he added.Leaving behind a trail of dustBBMP often flaunts its fleet of mechanical sweepers to underline its commitment to keep Bengaluru roads spick and span. But it has only drawn flak because of the machines, with citizens alleging they only leave behind a trail of dust. In fact, the civic agency’s decision to deploy the machines only at night is due to the backlash it fears in case they are used during the day.On December 9 last year, a mechanical sweeper was deployed in Yelahanka zone for cleaning roads ahead of a VIP visit. But the road users were aghast after the machine kicked up a cloud of dust it had lifted. BBMP zonal officials promptly admitted they were forced to use the machine during the day due to the VIP visit.The 17 new machines are to be equipped with GPS.

BENGALURU: At a time when gold prices are soaring, a surprise inspection of jewellery dealers in Chickpet by the state commercial taxes department has unearthed massive Goods and Services Tax (GST) violations and unaccounted gold.

The raids on 23 jewellers in Chickpet found 60kg of gold ornaments worth Rs 21 crore without valid documents. Officials also detected evasion of GST to the tune of Rs 1.3 crore.

Officials said they conducted the raids on wholesale jewellery dealers on Tuesday. “The raids were based on credible information and data analytics available in the backend system with the department,” said MS Srikar, commissioner of commercial taxes.

“The raids were based on information that many traders from other states visit the city and carry gold jewellery without any valid documents and supply it to local jewellers without invoices,” he said.

Officials said penalty was levied on the ornaments for which dealers couldn’t produce documents. “During the inspection, the officials caught two people carrying 3.5kg of gold ornaments in their bags without documents and collected penalty for the same,” they said.

In December 2019, a similar inspection was conducted on silver dealers in Raja Market. “The enforcement wing is keeping a close watch on the interstate movement of gold and silver. All dealers in the state have been advised not to buy any goods without valid invoices,” said Srikar.

“The decision was taken jointly by the district police, Rampur jail authorities and the administration for security reasons,” district magistrate Aunjaneya Kumar Singh told TOI.

Around 5am, the trio — accused of forging documents to help Abdullah get two birth certificates — was moved out of the Rampur district jail in a van for Sitapur under heavy security cover. The next date of hearing is March 2.

The DM said, “Many inmates lodged at the Rampur jail for different crimes were rounded up and chargesheeted by the SP government, in which Azam was a Cabinet minister, and officials suspect that the MP and his family could be attacked by inmates out of vengeance in the jail. Thus, they were shifted.”

Meanwhile, Azam’s counsel Khalil Ullaha Khan approached additional district and sessions judge Dhirendra Kumar Kamboj against the decision to shift his clients to the Sitapur jail , following which the ADJ sought a detailed report from the jail superintendent in this connection.

Meanwhile, SP chief Akhilesh Yadav, who visited Sitapur jail, termed the action against Azam and his family “a political vendetta”.

Bengaluru: Freedom fighter and Kannada Rajyotsava awardee Pandit Sudhakar Chaturvedi passed away at his residence on Thursday. He was said to be 122 years old.

Chaturvedi had a long association with Arya Samaj and retired from active social work a decade ago. Living with his family in Jayanagar, he passed away in his sleep at 3am.

Born Sudhakar Krishna Rao in Balepet in 1897, according to reports that couldn’t be independently verified, his family was originally from Kyatsandra near Tumakuru. They settled down in Bengaluru after Chaturvedi’s father became an inspector with the education department of the then Mysore government. Chaturvedi studied in the government primary school at Chamarajpet, but moved to Haridwar when he was 10 to join Arya Samaj.

During his gurukul days, he was inspired by the works of Swami Sharaddananda and later joined the news daily Vijay, started by Sharaddananda to support the freedom struggle soon after World War 1. Chaturvedi’s stint as a reporter took him to Jallianwala Bagh in Amristar on April 13, 1919. He recalled the massacre in his biography, Shataayushi Pandita Sudhakara Chaturvedi, penned by N Nagalaxmi.

Chaturvedi joined the freedom struggle and was an ardent supporter of Mahatma Gandhi. “He remained close to the Mahatma and worked for the upliftment of Scheduled Castes, mainly in Karnataka. Gandhi was fond of Chaturvedi and often called him Karnataki,” recalled Gandhian and Kannada historian Vemagal Somashekar.

An expert in Vedas, Chaturvedi conducted seminars and wrote extensively on Vedic practices after Independence. He was well-versed in Kannada, Sanskrit, Hindi and English.

From rescuing and rehabilitating injured, disabled and abandoned animals to counselling people involved in acts of cruelty to animals, Panneeru Prudhvi and Panneeru Teja have spent more than 10 years rescuing countless dogs, cats, birds, camels and several species of birds.

Narrating their journey, the two brothers say they knew right from their childhood that they wanted to dedicate themselves to help animals.

“As kids, we used to buy accessories for a dog even before we could bring one home,” said Teja. “Our parents never encouraged us to have a pet because they were worried we will not be able to take responsibility. And then, one day, my brother just brought a dog home. My mother was not very happy initially, but she got convinced after we promised to take good care of it.”

However, they say their journey towards becoming full-time animal caretakers and rescuers began only after getting introduced to an animal activist who inspired them to start volunteering for Blue Cross. They worked there for a while before training themselves in canine behaviour. Prudhvi is planning to pursue a course in animal law.

The brothers set up their own kennel at Cherlapally in 2018. “We want more people to come forward and help animals. Our aim is to build a network of like-minded people who can help animals and ensure they are able to co-exist peacefully with people,” said Prudhvi.

Teja and Prudhvi were part of the animal rescue operation during the Mahabubnagar floods and mission rabies project, where several dogs were vaccinated. “It is alright if you do not want to help animals but at least do not buy them from illegal breeders or abuse them,” Prudhvi said.

Speaking about their work, Mathew Christopher, a resident of Lalapet, said: “I met the brothers four years ago and since have been associated with them. Once Teja and his brother went down a well — around 40 to 50 foot deep — to rescue a cat.” He said, “Another time they rescued a badly beaten and abused dog, Fighter. We never imagined the dog would survive, and it is one of the happiest dogs in their kennel today.”

We suspect his rivals might be behind the murder ,” Alwal inspector P Yadagiri said.

“The assailants attacked Michael with sharp-edged objects and killed him. They later dragged the body near his house and set it ablaze with kerosene,” Yadagiri said. Cops suspect the victim could have been killed between 1 am and 3 am. A local alerted the cops. Police are analysing CCTV camera footages to identify the assailants.

Petbasheerabad ACP AVR Narasimha Rao said Michael’s parents died when he was a child. “He was living alone at Kotha Basthi in Venkatapuram. Eight months ago, he was involved in an assault case and fled from his house. Locals saw him near his house on Wednesday,” Rao said.

Locals told cops that Michael was roaming in the lanes and causing nuisance. He is survived by his younger brother and sister.

344,['28/02/2020'],Bihar now passes resolution seeking caste-based census,"This story is from February 28, 2020

Bihar CM Nitish Kumar

PATNA: The state assembly on Thursday unanimously adopted a resolution that the coming 2021 Census in the country should be based on caste, as the preparatory process for the launch of the enumeration of the country’s population and various aspects of their life has already been started by the office of the country’s registrar general and census commissioner, a subsidiary of the Union ministry of home affairs. Political parties have welcomed it.

Bihar is the second state to seek a caste-based census. Earlier on January 8 last, the Maharashtra House had passed a similar resolution.

Assembly speaker Vijay Kumar Choudhary on Thursday moved a one-line resolution in the pre-lunch session that the country’s Census 2021 should be based on caste, which the House adopted and passed it unanimously by thumping the desks. The resolution passed by the House would be duly sent to the Centre.

This followed the proposal of chief minister Nitish Kumar made in the House on Tuesday that it should adopt a resolution regarding holding the caste-based census in the country. “The last time, the caste census in the country had been made was in 1931. Several decades had passed since then. It has become necessary to hold the caste-based census again,” the CM had said on Tuesday.

Responding to the suggestion of the CM, Choudhary had said that it would be taken up at an “opportune time,” and accordingly, he proposed it on Thursday for adoption by the House. Explaining the government’s position on the caste census, the CM had said that both the state assembly and the legislative council, earlier in 2013, had also passed a resolution regarding the need for caste-based census. Further, the socio-economic survey and caste enumeration done in 2011 was for a limited purpose and was also found to be flawed, the CM had also said.

Observers felt that the political parties, like the RJD, had insisted on its demand that the details of the socio-economic and caste census should be made public, and had also made it an election issue, since it was made the basis for the demand for an increased number of “job quota” in proportion to the population figures of various castes falling in the intermediate caste groups (backward castes and extremely backward castes).

In fact, it had become a major issue during the 2015 Bihar assembly elections in which the NDA lost to the grand alliance, then comprising the JD(U), RJD and Congress. On Thursday, after the resolution regarding the caste census was adopted in the state assembly, reactions of political parties were on expected lines.

Talking to mediapersons, senior BJP leader and road construction department minister Nand Kishore Yadav said, “No, there is nothing new about it. Earlier too, the House had passed a resolution for a caste-based census.”

Similarly, the RJD chief whip Lalit Kumar Yadav said that his party has long conducted a popular struggle from “sadak (road)” to “Parliament/legislature” demanding that caste-based census be also held. “Today, the state assembly adopted a resolution on it again. We welcome it,” Yadav said.

HYDERABAD: A tipper driver was arrested for allegedly assaulting his wife at Kokapet on Thursday. He reportedly asked his son to record the assault on his mobile phone. Narsingi police have slapped attempt to murder and domestic harassment charges against tipper driver P Srinivas for harassing his wife, Manjula.

Srinivas had married Manjula of Wanaparthy 15 years ago and they have a 11-year-old son, police said. “Suspecting his wife’s character, Srinivas had been physically and mentally harassing her for the past few years. On February 25, Srinivas assaulted Manjula with an iron rod and made their son video record it on a cell phone,” Narsingi inspector Gangadhar said. Manjula suffered multiple injuries, including bleeding head injuries, in the assault.

HYDERABAD: On his way back to Pragathi Bhavan after attending a private function in Tolichowki on Thursday, chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao suddenly stopped his convoy midway, catching senior officials and security entourage off guard.

KCR got off his bullet-proof car on the roadside and approached a person holding a piece of paper. He made enquiries about the disabled person who introduced himself as Mohammed Saleem to the chief minister. The CM gave a patient hearing to the plight of Saleem and on the spot granted him pension and a double bedroom house.

Saleem told the chief minister that he was a driver and had been suffering from various ailments for the last nine years. Saleem broke his leg four years ago when he fell from a building.KCR responded immediately and instructed Hyderabad district collector Swetha Mohanty to disburse the disabled pension to Saleem and allot a two-bedroom house. Since Saleem had a disabled certificate, the collector sanctioned pension immediately and handed over Rs 3,016 pension for February. She said a house was sanctioned to Saleem at Jiyaguda.

HYDERABAD: Hyderabad: The suspension of entry on Umrah pilgrims by Saudi Arabia will hit several Muslims from Hyderabad. The suspension, announced on Thursday, has been put in place to restrict the entry of citizens of countries where cases of Coronavirus have been reported. The Umrah is a minor pilgrimage performed any time except during the Haj season. Thousands of Muslims from Hyderabad and other parts of the state perform Umrah every year, particularly during the Islamic months of Rajab, Shaban and Ramzan.Rajab, which set in a few days back, marks the beginning of the peak season for Umrah. The number of pilgrims for Umrah goes up manifold during Ramzan, the Muslim month of fasting. The annual Haj season is five months away and Saudi authorities have not stated if they will continue the curbs during Haj too or restrict the number of pilgrims. The Haj season this year will begin in July.Several pilgrims who went to airport on Thursday had to return home as a result of the ban. There was confusion among pilgrims as the announcement from Saudi authorities had come at the last minute. Salahuddin Ansari, officer on special duty in Telangana state waqf board, told TOI that he and his family members were scheduled to leave for Jeddah on Friday but then their travel agent informed him about the ban on Umrah. “I had prepared for Umrah for several months. We had packed our luggage and everyone in my family was ready for the pilgrimage. Now, I have cancelled my leave and am joining duty,” Salahuddin said.Waqf board chairman Mohammad Saleem said he too had put off his plans for Umrah in view of Coronavirus threat . “We have prepared the itinerary for mid-March. But the sudden ban on Umrah has come as a shock for us,” he told TOI. Wahiduddin Khaja of Aero Wings Travel and Cargo Agency, which processes Umrah and Haj travels, said that around 500 people from Hyderabad leave for Umrah every day. “The ban is likely to last long as there is no respite from Coronavirus. It is a huge financial loss to travel agents in the country,” he said hoping that the ban would be lifted at least during Ramzan.According to World Health Organisation (WHO), novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) is a cousin of the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), which is currently prevalent in Saudi Arabia. COVID-19, MERS and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) are caused by members of the Coronavirus family. Between December 1, 2019 and January 31, 2020, Saudi had reported 19 new cases of MERS including eight deaths. In view of the virus reaching Iran, Saudi authorities had imposed the travel ban.Though Saudi authorities have not specified the period of ban on Indian pilgrims for Umrah, in a separate circular the Saudi ministry of health has imposed restriction on travel and cancelled leaves of employees in the Mecca health care cluster from March 15 to May 30. Imposing ban on travel for those in Mecca cluster, the health ministry said except for urgent cases, travel outside the station should not be allowed.",hyderabad,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74361175,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-257789,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/saudi-suspends-umrah-visa-over-covid-19-pilgrimage-plans-of-thousands-from-hyd-hit/articleshow/74347756.cms

HYDERABAD: Arekapudi Gandhi sparked a fresh controversy on Thursday by claiming that no Muslim would be sent away as long as CM K Chandrasekhar Rao is at the helm. His remarks came at a time when CAA, NRC and NPR have generated a lot of heat in Telangana.

Speaking to a group of Muslims from his constituency, Gandhi said: “Nobody can throw you (Muslims) out even if you come from Pakistan, Rajasthan, Maharashtra or Karnataka as long as CM KCR is alive. If such a situation arises, local corporators and I will come out with you and support you,” he told them. A video of this had gone viral already. He also said some BJP workers were working as agents and moving around in Hafeezpet, Hydernagar and Allwyn Colony areas by conducting an internal survey on CAA and asked locals to revolt against them.

349,['28/02/2020'],Karnataka State Road Transport Corporation accidents dip; officials say preventive systems in place,"BENGALURU: Last week’s accident in Tamil Nadu, where a rashly driven container truck collided with a Kerala State Road Transport Corporation bus killing 19 people, has put the spotlight on passenger safety. However, Karnataka State Road Transport Corporation (KSRTC) has seen a drop in the number of accidents involving its buses — from 1,266 in 2013-14 to 1,018 in 2018-19 — thanks to a slew of measures.In a first, KSRTC had piloted the Artificial intelligence (AI)-based anti-collision and anti-drowsiness system in two buses, which detects any vehicle/obstacle up to 50 metres and automatically reduces the speed and stops it. The system also monitors the driver’s eye movements and sounds an alarm in case he appears sleepy. “We are planning to extend this technology to 400 premium buses in a phased manner,” a senior KSRTC official said.Officials said seat belts are provided in front and last rows in most premium buses but only a few passengers use them.KSRTC also has check points at places like Krishnagiri, Palamaner, Bagepalli and Sakleshpur, where long-distance buses are stopped for about 10 minutes. The crew of buses plying between 1am and 5am has to halt and wash their faces, have tea and provide feedback on the vehicle condition and journey. “Alcometers are used to check whether the staffers are under the influence of alcohol,” said an official.Bengaluru-Chennai and Bengaluru-Coimbatore routes are more prone to accidents. “These are poorly designed highways and have more curves. Most sections along these two routes are not barricaded properly and are more vulnerable to accidents. Height of road dividers should be increased to prevent accidents,” pointed out officials.KSRTC ensures its staffers get rest. Buses running for more than 450km must have a driver and driver-cum-conductor so that one person is not at the wheel for long. “There’s a break of 48 hours after two trips. In private buses, staffers work continuously for 20 days and then take a 10-day break,” the officials said.Another official said most buses are fitted with an electronically controlled speed-locking system , which limits the speed at 80kmph. The corporation conducts redressal meetings with crew every month and also focuses on fuel efficiency. “We train drivers to achieve high fuel efficiency so that they are focused and don’t indulge in rash driving and sudden braking,” he added.",bengaluru,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74365029,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-441888,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/ksrtc-accidents-dip-officials-say-preventive-systems-in-place/articleshow/74344999.cms

Representative Image

BENGALURU: A 32-year-old rowdy-sheeter and murder suspect was shot dead when he allegedly attempted to flee from police custody near Hesaraghatta, northwest of Bengaluru, in the wee hours of Thursday.

Bharath alias Slum Bharath, resident of Rajagopalnagar, succumbed to bullet injuries before cops could shift him to hospital from the scene of encounter around 5am. He was facing at least 43 criminal cases, including five of murder and seven of attempt to murder, besides dacoity and kidnap, across the city. He was arrested from a hideout in Uttar Pradesh recently and was brought to the city for questioning on Monday.

DCP (north) N Shashikumar said his men fired at Bharath in self-defence after he opened fire on them. Trouble began around 2am when Bharath was being taken for spot inquiry when at least two dozen associates came in two SUVs and several bikes and attacked the police party near Rajagopalnagar. Unprepared for the attack, police could not catch hold of Bharath, who jumped off the jeep and began running.

“Bharath sped away in a maroon Maruti Zen, while his associates were in a Toyota Innova. The news of his escape was flashed across the city. Around 5am, a police patrol vehicle spotted the Zen and Toyota Innova on Soldavanahalli Main Road. Soon, four teams headed by two inspectors rushed to the spot,” said Shashikumar.

This time, Bharath was inside the Innova with his aides. On reaching Hesaraghatta Main Road, police blocked Bharath’s vehicle. To their shock, he whipped out a pistol and fired five rounds at them, while his associates fled.

Questioning associates

Inspectors BN Lohit Kumar of Nandini Layout and Dinesh of Rajagopalnagar were wearing bulletproof jackets and remained unhurt, Shashikumar said. “In self-defence, the inspectors opened fire on Bharath, and the bullet hit his stomach. We shifted him to a nearby private hospital where doctors declared him brought dead.”

Police have now rounded up several of Bharath’s associates and are questioning them.

Speaking to TOI, Vilas Madigeri, chairman of the standing committee, said six supplementary proposals amounting to Rs 700 crore were made to the Rs 6,627.99 crore draft budget presented by municipal commissioner Shravan Hardikar on February 17.

Madigeri said seven wonder theme park in Chinchwad assembly constituency at Rs 5 crore and a competitive exam centre each in Pimpri, Chinchwad and Bhosari assembly constituencies at Rs 1 crore were approved.

Chennai: Actor Rajinikanth on Wednesday blamed intelligence failure for the violence in New Delhi. Any violence should be put down with an iron hand, he said and added that this should not have been allowed to happen when world leaders like US President Donald Trump were in India.

“It is a total failure of central intelligence. The Union home ministry’s intelligence failure. I strongly condemn it. They should put down violence with an iron hand or else they should resign and go,” Rajinikanth said, his tone sharp with anger, while talking to media representatives outside his Poes Garden residence. “They should have been so careful when US President (Donald) Trump had visited (the country). The intelligence didn’t do its job properly. It (violence) should have been completely crushed with an iron fist. We expect them to be careful at least from now on,” he added.

The actor said such protests should be nipped in the bud. “The protests in Delhi have gone too far. If they are not controlled now, it will lead to larger problems in future,” he said. “I always speak the truth. But it hurts when certain people, especially senior political observers and critics, say that I am promoting BJP’s thoughts and that BJP is behind me. It is not true,” he said.

Rajinikanth’s condemnation of the Delhi violence found immediate support in actor and Makkal Needhi Maiam president Kamal Haasan. “Sabaash my friend Rajinikanth,” Kamal tweeted in Tamil, welcoming his stand. “This is the right path. Not a lonely path, but one along which the entire state walks. Welcome and Congrats,” Kamal Haasan tweeted. Kamal was ostensibly taking a dig at Rajnikanth’s famous movie dialogue with a political innuendo, ‘En vazhi, thani vazhi’ (My path is a separate path).

Earlier, to a question on a Union minister making an incendiary speech that allegedly triggered the violence, Rajnikanth said just because one person said so, it is not right to blame the entire government for it. “I condemn anyone instigating people in the name of religion. I request the media to be neutral and not to give space for provocative speeches and violence,” he said.

“I had clearly mentioned earlier that if any single Muslim is affected by the CAA, I will come out and lead the protests,” Rajinikanth said, reiterating his earlier statement. “The CAA law has been passed by both houses of Parliament and it has received the President’s nod. I don’t believe it will be withdrawn by the Centre . People can protest. But, there should be no room for violence,” he said.

Every year thousands of people lose their lives on the road because of potholes. Rather than complaining and waiting for the civic body to repair them, 29-year-old Karthik Pallam, a techie from Sircilla town, decided to take matters into his own hands. In 2017, he filled his first pothole in Hi-Tec City with a meagre Rs 2,000, from his own pocket. Soon after, We Can Make a Change (WCMAC) was born.

Two years later, the NGO has 200 volunteers, mostly software engineers, who have fixed over 300 potholes across Hyderabad in areas such as Begumpet, Hi-Tec City, Panjagutta and Ameerpet among others. The Rs 2 lakh spent on the job has entirely been from their savings.

“When I was in Bengaluru previously, I had noticed that a pothole remained unattended for 45 days despite complaints. I later found that more people die owing to potholes than in terrorist attacks. So, I decided to fill potholes and thought it would be great achievement even if I could save one life,” Pallam told TOI.

Another volunteer from the group, Sudeepth Katkam, chipped in: “While travelling to office I once saw a bike skid on a pothole and fall right next to me. A motorist who veered to prevent hitting this bike fell too. And all because of a pothole. So, the next weekend we fixed the pothole.”

Along with fixing potholes, the NGO has now simultaneously started repairing government schools, including Anganwadis, in remote areas. They have repaired six school so far. Among them is Andhra Vidyalaya in Chikkadpally. TOI spoke to its principal B R Vidya Sagar, who said, “We get a meagre allowance, which is only enough to pay bills. We are happy with what WCMAC did. After the repairs, our attendance has increased and many dropouts too have returned to school.”

Volunteers said that the job is extremely gratifying. “After the repairs the children hug you and thank you…there is no greater reward than that,” said Chakradhar Ayachitula.

KOLKATA: The autopsy report in the Sinthee custodial death case indicated that Raj Kumar Shaw (50) suffered cardiac arrest due to cardiovascular and renal problems. The report, however, pointed out that two bruises — one on the left elbow and another on the skull — were caused by “blunt trauma” that had taken place 12-24 hours before the autopsy, which coincided with the time Shaw was at the Sinthee police station on February 10. The report added the bruises could not have led to his death.

Police refused to comment on the report, which has been submitted to Calcutta High Court and sent to National Human Rights Commission. Shaw, the report said, was brought dead to RG Kar Hospital at 6.50pm on February 10 and an autopsy was carried out at 2pm, the next day. It was preceded by a judicial inquest, which, conducted over one hour, 10 minutes, indicated a final report could be given only after a histo-pathological examination of the viscera. On a query on whether the injuries alone could have caused the death, the report stated, “Injuries as noted above are singly or collectively not sufficient to cause death in ordinary course of nature.”

Lawyer Jayanta Narayan Chatterjee said, “Post-mortem report shows injuries on his head and elbow. This shows the version of eye witnesses—Shaw’s brother and son—who were present at the police station was right. He was assaulted and thereafter, he died. Police are responsible when a person expires due to cardiac arrest hours after he is assaulted inside a police station. A murder case should be started.” Police refused to comment. “The matter is sub judice”. It is being heard by the Calcutta HC. Two officers have been closed, one suspended,” an officer said.

359,['28/02/2020'],HC directs disciplinary action against 2 govt officials,"This story is from February 28, 2020

Madurai: Taking serious note of the dereliction of duty by a multipurpose health supervisor at the Government Rajaji Hospital (GRH) and an inspector of police of the K Pudur police station in handing over the death certificate and postmortem report to the family of a woman who died due to medical negligence, the Madras high court has directed disciplinary action against them.

S Manimuthu, the husband of Sakthikali, filed a petition seeking Rs 10 lakh compensation for his wife’s death. The petitioner also sought to issue the death certificate and postmortem report. Sakthikali was admitted for delivery at the K Pudur urban primary health centre on September 14, 2019. The duty doctor stated that the delivery would be normal and there is no complication. After the doctor left the hospital, his wife went into labour and the doctor did not return till 11pm.

Few minutes later when the nurse called him inside the UPHC, he noticed that his wife was lying in a pool of blood and immediately he took his wife to the GRH in an ambulance where the doctors declared her brought dead. Based on his complaint, the K Pudur police have registered a case under Section 174 CrPC.

Justice Pushpa Sathyanarayana observed that the court had directed the authorities to file an affidavit explaining as to why the reasons for the death of woman was not informed to the petitioner. Refusing to accept the reasons cited by the officials for the delay, the judge observed that officials are pointing fingers at each other without performing their duties. “When it comes to uniformed services and health service, it is round-the-clock service and they have more rigid duty cast upon them than the other public servants,” observed the judge. The judge noted that only after the intervention of this court, the death certificate was handed over to the petitioner. The judge observed that it is abundantly clear that multipurpose supervisor Theenathayalan and inspector of police Muthukumar are prima facie liable for the lapses committed by them in the discharge of their duties. Hence, the judge directed the Madurai deputy director of health services and Madurai city commissioner of police to initiate appropriate departmental action against Theenathayalan and Muthukumar respectively within a period of four weeks.

The judge further directed the commissioner of police to hand over the investigation to some other inspector of police who should file a final report before the jurisdictional magistrate not later than three months.

Justice Pushpa Sathyanarayana also took cognizance of a government order (GO) passed by the health and family welfare department notifying the Tamil Nadu Clinical Establishments (Regulation) Rules, 2018, which prescribed minimum facilities of a clinical establishment including the number of staff and equipment. The judge directed the state government to ensure that all hospitals strictly comply with the rules and directed the health secretary to issue circulars to refer the patients to the district headquarters hospitals or other hospitals if the required facilities are not available at any hospitals rather than waiting for the patient to reach a critical condition.

Julfesh Shah addresses women entrepreneurs at VIA auditorium

Nagpur: Women should be encouraged to become self-sufficient and turn entrepreneurs so that they also could generate employment opportunities for others also and help in boosting trade, said chartered accountant Julfesh Shah at Vidarbha Industries Association (VIA) auditorium on Wednesday.

He was addressing a session organized by VIA Lady Entrepreneurs ‘(LEW) wing on ‘New budget: Women entrepreneurs’ perspective and government schemes’. Reeta Lanjewar, chairperson of LEW and Sneha Trivedi from Burn Smooth Petrochem were present.

Shah highlighted various schemes the government launched to promote women entrepreneurship. It is time aspiring businesswomen make optimum use of technology to get details of schemes and start their units, he said.

Micro, small and medium scale (MSME) enterprises provide ample scope to avail benefits extended by the central and state governments and women should help bring about a change to usher in economic and social development, he said.

At present, the share of women entrepreneurs in Maharashtra is 9% which the government plans to increase to 20% by introduction of various schemes, he added.

Schemes like Mudra Yojna, Trade-related entrepreneurship assistance and development (TREAD), Mahila Udgam Nidhi, Annapurna, Stree Shakti, Bhatiya Mahila Business Bank Loan, Dena Shakti, Cent Kalyani and Udyogini. Women entrepreneurs should go through these schemes thoroughly and pick them according to their areas of interests, Shah said.

A question and answer was held later in which Shah replied to the queries raised by the participants.

Vandana Sharma, former chairman of LEW and Manisha Bawankar, secretary, were present. Manisha Bawankar proposed a vote of thanks.

Pune: Scientists at the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research (IISER), Pune are working on the 'bits' in the processor of a quantum computer.

In classical computer processors, one has 32 or 64 bits to carry out computations and processing of information.

IISER scientists are trying to increase a similar number of mechanical bits in a quantum computer. They have received an allocation of Rs 25 crore. The project is part of the National Mission on Quantum Technologies and Applications (QTA) which received Rs 300 crore from the department of science and technology for 51 projects across India.

The Interdisciplinary Cyber Physical Systems division of the department recently released the financial sanction under 'Quantum Enabled Science and technology (QUEST)' programme, Umakant Rapol and T S Mahesh said. Both are leading two experimental projects of the 51 in this programme.

Co-principal investigators include MS Santhanam, Rejish Nath, and GV Pavan Kumar.

“Like in classical computer processors, one has 32 or 64 bits to carry out computations and processing of information that finally will be used to convert, store, display, process and transfer data among different devices. To get to a similar number of quantum mechanical bits in a quantum computer is a big technical and scientific challenge,” Rapol added.

363,['28/02/2020'],Forest department rescues leopard from trap for wild boars in Pargaon,"This story is from February 28, 2020

Pimpri Chinchwad: The forest department on Wednesday morning rescued a leopard from a trap laid by some unidentified people for hunting wild boars at Pargaon village in Daund taluka.

Daund range forest officer (RFO) MN Hazare said the forest department has lodged a complaint against unknown persons under section 9 of Wildlife Act 1972 for trying to hunt wild animals.

He said, “The leopard was found in a field owned by a farmer, Sunil Shelke, in Pargaon. When Shelke went to the field around 7am, he spotted the animal with its leg entangled in a trap laid for catching wild boars. A rescue team rushed to the spot after he informed the forest department and freed the leopard”

Forest guard Nana Chavan said some villagers had informed the department about the trapped leopard around 7.30am. “We reached out to the animal rescue team from Pune. The team reached the spot within 1-1.5 hours. Our team prevented the villagers from going anywhere near the spot. The sight of human beings could have made the leopard aggressive and hindered our rescue operation,” he said.

The guard added that around 40 people from the forest department and the rescue centre were involved in the operation. The rescue team tranquillized the leopard and took it to Pune for treatment.

Shelke said, “The leopard growled at me when I was 20-25 feet away from it on the field. I noticed that it was unable to move, as its hind leg was trapped. I informed the forest department.”

Chavan said, “Sugar cane is cultivated on a large scale at Pargaon and its surrounding villages. Sugar cane fields provide good hiding places for leopards. This village is located close to Shirur taluka and Ahmednagar district. Leopards are regularly sighted in these villages.”

364,['28/02/2020'],Act on bogus institutes offering unrecognized med courses: HC,"This story is from February 28, 2020

Madurai: Madras high court has dismissed a batch of petitions filed by electropathy practitioners taking cognizance of the fact that they obtained unrecognized medical diploma degrees from unrecognized institutions. The court directed the central and state governments to take immediate action against bogus institutes offering such courses putting at stake the lives of youngsters.

The petitioners had sought to forbear the registrar of Tamil Nadu Homeopathy Medical Council from interfering with their practice by asking them not to practise without registering their diploma certificates in their council. They said the police were carrying out inspections in their clinics. When they approached the council seeking recognition, it was not granted. On perusal of the submissions, Justice Pushpa Sathyanarayana observed that most of the certificates produced by the petitioners of their diploma degree were issued by private institutions without affiliation to any statutory body or university recognised by Acts of Parliament. Having joined such courses, they were stopped from claiming any right to register themselves in the statutory council or practise.

Taking cognizance of the fact that Electro Homeopathy System of Medicine (Recognition) Bill has not been passed in Parliament, the judge dismissed the petitions. The judge noted that this was a classic example of students taking up an unrecognized course and being forced to linger around the court even after completing the course successfully, wasting time, money and risk for which they are not responsible. “The right of every Indian citizen to health and the right to receive proper medical care by qualified medical personnel is violated not only by the existence of quacks, but also by the practitioners with unrecognized medical degree. Eventually, the life of the patient is at risk,” the court said adding the quality and faith in the medical education would come down significantly if such unrecognized medical certificates are permitted to be issued.

The judge observed that the union ministry of health and family welfare had issued an order in 2003 directing the state governments and union territories to ensure that no institutions offer any degree or diploma in the stream of medicine which have not been recommended for recognition. Despite this, the institutes in which the petitioners studied were able to offer such course. The issue cannot be weighed lightly and the authorities concerned should be held accountable. The judge directed the central and state governments to take immediate action against such institutes and have a serious check on these issues without any delay. The judge also asked the students to be cautious before choosing a course and institutions.

Nagpur: Widening work of five roads has been stuck for want of over Rs371 crore government funds. Mayor Sandip Joshi on Thursday directed the civic administration to follow-up with the government to get the funds released.

The five roads — Kelibagh Road, Pardi Road, Old Bhandara Road, Ramji Pehlwan Road and Wardha Road-Ajni-Somalwada — are part of city’s development plan and as a planning authority, the Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) is supposed to carry out the work.

Following complaints from residents over no progress of these five roads, the mayor on Thursday convened a meeting with officials of project department and zones.

For widening of all the five roads, the civic body has calculated Rs642 crore as cost towards acquisition of properties. Of this, the NMC will bear 30% (over Rs192 crore), while government will contribute over Rs449 crore. Of its share, the government has sanctioned only Rs77 crore, the mayor was informed by the officials.

The non-receipt of government’s share has forced the NMC to stop the widening work, officials informed and added that the NMC has already completed all the procedures.

366,['28/02/2020'],Setback for state as Centre notifies Mhadei final award,"This story is from February 28, 2020

Panaji: In what appears to be a huge setback to Goa’s plans of stopping Karnataka from going ahead with its Kalasa-Bhandura project, the Centre on Thursday notified the Mhadei Water Disputes Tribunal ’s final award that was given on August 14, 2018.

Chief minister Pramod Sawant said the state will challenge the notification. “We will move the Supreme Court to obtain a stay against the notification,” he told TOI.

The notification comes two days after the state government sought a stay from the SC to restrain Karnataka from starting construction or any other activity on the Mhadei for the Kalasa-Bhandura project, which will come up for hearing on March 2.

Last Wednesday, the Centre had extended the tribunal’s term by six months till August 19 to give the final award.

But with Karnataka moving the Supreme Court for notifying the award and Goa and Maharashtra—the other riparian states in the Mhadei dispute—not objecting to it, the apex court had directed the Centre last Thursday to notify the award, but had said it was subject to the outcome of the petitions filed by the riparian states against the award.

The Supreme Court also admitted Goa government’s special leave petition challenging the award and posted it for final hearing on July 15, 16 and 24.

“If the judgment comes in favour of Goa, this notification becomes null and void,” Sawant said.

Karnataka has always claimed that once the award is notified, it can take up construction of the Kalasa-Bhandura drinking water project without hurdles.

In a tweet, Goa Forward Party president Vijai Sardesai said the worst fears have come true. “With the government notifying the final decision of the tribunal, all hope has faded,” he said.

Questioning the state government and the chief minister, Sardesai said: “Everything you said and claimed you did on Mhadei was nothing but lies and falsehoods? The government stands exposed!”

Pune: Rupan Raju Rokade of Shantinagar in Wanowrie died after falling in an elevator duct from the sixth floor of a residential building, Sacred Heart Society, located near Jagtap Chowk in Wanowrie late at around 11pm on February 21.

The Wanowrie police has registered a case of accidental death in this regard. Assistant inspector Bhagwan Kamble of the Wanowrie police said, “Rokade (20) was unemployed and son to a retired policeman.”

“We are investigating the case. It is suspected that he either jumped into the duct or accidentally fell down because there are no signs of anyone having pushed him,” he said.

“It is not known why he went to the society. It is also unclear as to how the doors of the elevator shaft on the sixth floor opened,” he said.

Kamble said there was a loud noise when Rokade fell down on the roof of the elevator bucket. “The residents of the society then called the police,” he said.

“We have taken down his parents’ statements and they informed us that he was under tremendous stress and had hardly spoken to his family in the last few months,” he said.

Vijayawada: Andhra Pradesh Non-Gazetted Officers Association ( APNGO ) on Thursday demanded the state government to clear the uncertainty over the long pending demands of government employees.

APNGO Association on Thursday observed ‘demands day’ as per the national-level call given by All India State Employees Federation.

The APNGO state president N Chandrasekhar Reddy participated in the demonstration held at Irrigation Offices Complex in the city along with hundreds of employees.

APNGOs alleged that chief minister Y S Jaganmohan Reddy is ignoring the problems faced by the government employees in the last nine months of his ruling.

“Jagan promised to remove contributory pension scheme during his election campaign. Government employees trusted him and eagerly waited for a positive decision after he came to power. But there is no response from him after becoming chief minister. Deceiving government employees has become a routine for the political parties,” Chandrasekhar Reddy said.

He said the government is deliberately delaying the pay revision commission (PRC) by constituting a number of committees.

Amaravati Joint Action Committee (APJAC) state secretary-general Joseph Sudheer Babu demanded the CM to fulfill his election promises. “ The CM made a number of promises for the welfare of employees but has ignored them. We will intensify our protests if he does not deliver,” he said.

The employees also demanded the government to increase the retirement age to 62 years.

369,['28/02/2020'],"Invasive plants spreading faster &amp; wider, say experts","This story is from February 28, 2020

Pune: Invasive plant species are affecting native species of biodiversity more adversely now, ecologists said.

Sachin Punekar, an ecologist and founder-president of Biospheres, said, “ Invasive species can sweep away local biodiversity and are the second biggest threat, after habitat destruction and alteration.”

Punekar has been actively involved in weed eradication programmes that he started in 2016. The commonest invasive plant species was cosmos bipinnatus or the Mexican weed and eupatorium odoratum.

The post-monsoon invasion of cosmos bipinnatus can wreak havoc on local flora. They grow along the roadside and the hill slopes.

Cosmos can be seen growing in clumps at Katraj Ghat, Sinhagad and Shivneri forts. “The species is growing near the forts, ghat regions and along the roadside. Earlier, it was in some pockets of Taljai hill. It has spread everywhere,” he said.

Their growth hampers native grasses which are fodder species that herbivores and livestock feed on. Invasive species is are allelopathic and as such poisonous to native crops, Punekar added.

Eupatorium odoratum is commonly seen in the outskirts of deciduous as well as moist deciduous forests throughout the Western Ghats. “Both the species form dense clumps, hardly allowing other native species to grow,” Punekar added.

Amateur botanist Shrikant Ingalhalikar said there was a problem of incorrect interpretation of native and invasive species. Many native trees have disappeared from Pune out of sheer negligence and people are fighting to save the invasive plants, he added.

“The problem lies in the interpretation of native and invasive varieties. Considering examples of native and exotic species, it is important to understand that all exotic species are not invasive. As a blanket, when everyone talks about exotic, they think every exotic species is invasive. There has to be focus on eradication of invasive species like cosmos or water hyacinth,” he said.

The area under cosmos species is doubling each year, he said. “Cosmos is a harmful species and has to be nipped before it flowers. I have been observing it for about 40 years and each year it is doubling. Now, it is beyond control,” he added.

370,['28/02/2020'],Bail for two women Maoists in 1 of 4 pending cases against them,"This story is from February 28, 2020

Representative image

MADURAI: The Madras high court has granted bail to women Maoists in one of the four cases pending against them, after taking into consideration their age and the fact that they are languishing in prison for more than three years as their right of speedy trial has been infringed.

Justice G R Swaminathan passed the order while hearing the bail plea of Kala, 59, and Chandra, 52, in a case which was registered against them by the Q Branch CID in 2016. The case is under trial on the file of the Karur principal sessions judge.

The government advocate very strongly opposed the granting of bail pointing out that the petitioners are ardent members of a terrorist. He also told the court that while attending the funeral of Manivasagam, Kala’s husband and Chandra’s brother who was shot dead recently by the Kerala police, the duo made highly provocative speeches. He said the petitioners were put on terms when a division bench had granted leave to them to attend the funeral.

The judge observed that the government advocate also passed on the video recording in which Chandra is seen making highly provocative and offending statements and called for bloody revenge for Manivasagam’s death.

Taking note of the government counsel’s contention, the judge observed, “We are a functioning democracy. Free speech is a cherished fundamental right. The petitioners are ideologically committed. Therefore, on occasions of such as arrest or remand, they are bound to raise slogans. It is not the case of the prosecution that the something untoward happened as a result. Slogan shouting itself and in the absence of any other adverse consequence, ought not to attract criminal prosecution.”

The judge noted that when their home was searched, they found mobile phones, sim cards and some party literature including the bylaws of banned organisation. The judge observed that the petitioners are facing three other cases apart from the case on hand. The judge observed that the case on hand does not involve any violence as no witness deposed that the petitioners attempted to recruit anyone for committing any terrorist act. “There are some material to come to a conclusion that the petitioners are members of a banned organisation. But whether that can be called as a terrorist organisation is to be established only in a regular trial and the material on record is not sufficient to come to that conclusion,” observed the judge.

The judge noted that though the final report was filed in 2017 and the case was pending for more than three years, the right of the petitioners to speedy trial has been infringed. Hence, the judge granted bail to the petitioners in this case. When the petitioners’ counsel stated that the petitioners are in confinement in connection with other cases also, the judge observed that the petitioners are entitled to come out of prison if they are granted bail in the other cases as well.

373,['28/02/2020'],Activists want more from grievance redressal cell for schools,"This story is from February 28, 2020

Pune: A special committee to address the grievances of school employees, students and parents has been set up by the state education department.

The redressal cell, headed by the divisional chairman of Maharashtra State Board of Secondary and Higher Secondary Education, will induct three government representatives. The committee will address issues on the first Monday of every month, a notification issued by the state government on Wednesday said.

Issues related to Right to Education Act (RTE), compulsion of buying books and uniforms from the respective private schools, corporal punishment, sexual or mental harassment, difficulty in obtaining no objection certificate mandatory for various works, among others, would come under the purview of the committee, the notification added.

Parents of school-goers across the city had complained of a spurt in fees for admission to private schools. Previous TOI reports show that despite parents having staged protests and written to the respective deputy directors, the administration had not implemented corrective measures.

Proper implementation of RTE Act, which stipulates that private schools reserve 25% of seats at the entry-level for children belonging to ‘disadvantaged groups’ and ‘weaker sections’, was mired in controversies. Several complaints of schools refusing to admit such students, or even asking for money beyond the tuition fee, have emerged.

The activists said the panel needed more diverse representation. “The deputy directors always had the power to act against the erring schools. But, they failed to even file an FIR against the violators. The special committee has the same people. We need a third party in the committee, which will audit the panel’s work. A grievance redressal cell is necessary and it should do more than just being present,” education activist Vaishali Bafna said.

Vijayawada: National Science Day was observed at SRM University, Amaravati campus, on Thursday. Professor M Lakshmi Kantham, distinguished professor at Institution of Chemical Technology, Mumbai, attended the celebrations as chief guest. A programme was held on the theme of “Women in Science.”

Speaking on the occasion, Kantham remembered the women who contributed to science and technology. She recalled Anandibai Gopalrao Joshi, the first woman physician, Anna Mani, Indian physicist, and meteorologist, Ashima Chatterjee, inventor of anti-malarial drugs, to name a few. She used this opportunity to spread awareness among the students to avail various fellowship programmes offered by the government to women students.

She said the challenges faced by India can be solved by encouraging more female students to undertake research. She said, “Invention of technology is a result of teamwork. Passion, perfection, and persistence are key to research whereas hard work and innovation lead to success”.

D Narayana Rao, vice-chancellor of SRM, AP, said, “Science Day is observed to recognise the scientists’ contribution to society, to provide a platform to young scientists and kindle their interest in science, to create awareness regarding the significance of science and its applications, to discuss issues, and to popularise the opportunities offered by science.”

375,['28/02/2020'],Ensure lawyers for sedition-accused: HC,"This story is from February 28, 2020

BENGALURU: To uphold the best legal traditions, a member of the Hubballi Bar Association (HBA) should appear on behalf of the three Kashmiri students charged with sedition for allegedly raising pro-Pakistan slogans in their engineering college hostel in Hubballi on February 14, the Karnataka high court observed on Thursday.

The observation came a day after the court slammed the local bar for allegedly heckling a group of Bengaluru lawyers who had appeared on behalf of the students, calling it “sheer militancy”.

On Thursday, HBA officer-bearers appeared before the court with a fresh resolution, modifying the one passed on February 15 that had barred its members from appearing for the accused. However, the court was still unhappy with the resolution, which now left the issue to individual members.

A division bench headed by Chief Justice Abhay Shreeniwas Oka noted that instead of modifying it, the association should have simply recalled the contentious resolution. The association agreed to take back the resolution.

Meanwhile, despite assurances from HBA office-bearers to ensure that proceedings are conducted in a peaceful manner, the bench said its February 20 order directing the local police to provide security to advocates appearing for the three students will continue.

“We would have transferred the case here (from Hubballi-Dharwad to Bengaluru). That was a simple task. However, as far as possible, it should be heard there. That will send the right signal. It is not good that lawyers have to seek police protection for appearing in a court,” the chief justice observed.

Advocate Maitreyi Krishna and others were allegedly heckled by HBA members on Monday, when they attended the Dharwad court to file bail applications on behalf of the accused students.

On February 15, the bar association had passed a resolution, asking its members not to represent the students. It had also called upon members of other bar associations to follow suit.

Advocate B T Venkatesh and 23 other lawyers then approached the HC through a PIL, seeking the quashing of the resolution. The next hearing on the PIL is scheduled for March 6.

376,['28/02/2020'],"Bus shelters barely useful, and absent where needed","This story is from February 28, 2020

Madurai: Madurai boasts many bus shelters, but they hardly serve their purpose at the places where they exist. And they are absent where they are required the most. Almost all bus shelters in the city have been converted into steel structures with benches to facilitate seating for the waiting passengers, but many of these seats are unusable for some reason or other.

For instance, there is a shelter with a badly damaged roof at the Aravind Eye Hospital junction in Anna Nagar but no bus has halted here till date. To make matters worse, the seat is about 4 feet above the ground making it impossible for an elderly person or child to sit on it comfortably. This is the situation at many shelters in the city.

On the opposite side, there are three shelters one after another from Aavin junction to the Wakf Board College at K K Nagar. The one in the middle has never seen a bus stop by thereby making it an ideal spot for people to doze off in the scorching afternoons. Similarly, there are several shelters in front of the district court which are rendered useless. The roof does not do much to keep the sun away and seats are not comfortable for all ages. “There are so many shelters here that are actually encroaching on the space for pedestrians,’’ said K Sugumar of K K Nagar.

With the Periyar bus stand being closed for renovation, many city buses now stop at South Marret and East Marret street, but these roads have no proper shelter for commuters. Since the corporation claims that it cannot provide temporary shelters near the Periyar bus stand as work is going on, people are forced to stand in the hot sun. On Thursday, members of the DYFI conducted a signature campaign demanding that the corporation provide temporary shelters near Periyar bus stand till the work is completed. “Lack of shelters will put the lives of people who commute through this bus stand every day at risk,’’ said DYFI district president R Selva.

“At many places, they are just steel structures which may give an aesthetic appeal , but steel becomes hot when it is not used for long periods. The roofs are also narrow and don’t provide much shelter,’’ said A Asokan of Makkal Sakthi Iyakkam. City engineer S Arasu said they expected the Periyar bus stand works to be completed by May-June. Bus shelters were an important part of ongoing smart city projects and would soon be reorganised in coordination with transport department, he added.

CHENNAI: After school hours, Anita* waited for her mom at the school gate for an hour, sobbing. Her mom hadn’t turned up, again.“I forgot to pick up my child because I was drinking at home,” said Pratibha*, a homemaker who is undergoing treatment at a de-addiction centre in Chennai. “When this repeated, I realised I needed help.”Three years ago, the number of women in the city who sought help for alcohol de-addiction was very few. Today rehab centres are teeming with them. In the past two years, the TT Ranganathan Clinical Research Foundation (TTK Hospital) has received around 90 such women.Not all of them get admitted; most of them opt for outpatient services. “This is because there is still a stigma associated with women drinking. While it is normal for a man to seek help, a woman hesitates,” said Jacqueline David, senior counsellor at TTK.The number is less compared to men, which is at least 50 a month. “There was a time when we would hardly get a woman alcoholic a year. And the few patients were from economically weaker sections. Today we see cases from all socio-economic backgrounds,” said Jacqueline.Dr Lakshmi Vijaykumar, head of the psychiatric department at Voluntary Health Services (VHS) which provides de-addiction services, said her centre has seen a considerable rise in the number of women battling alcohol addiction . “We used to get two a year, now we get around 20,” she said. Most women start with social drinking. “In many cases, we found that the habit was introduced to them by their husbands,” said Dr Vijaykumar. She cited an incident where a young IT employee began with a glass of wine a day after work, with her husband. A few months later, he passed away and the woman became an addict. “When she came to us for help, we found that she had become an alcoholic and had withdrawal symptoms every time she tried to stop,” she said.Experts said women are prone to have more health and psychological issues. “They are at a higher risk of being victims of sexual assault and acts of violence,” said Dr Sujatha Velmurugan, consultant psychiatrist at Kauvery Hospital. Though women today are more independent and financially secure, when it comes to having serious conversations on substance abuse, they are often left out. “Once branded an alcoholic, she will have to work harder and restart her life, but the tag may remain. Because women are expected to uphold honour of the family,” said Dr Sujatha.TTK has been holding awareness programmes on alcoholism. “We speak with women of all age groups and explain the ill-effects of substance abuse,” said Maya Varadarajan, managing trustee of the organisation. “We have to understand that alcoholism is a health hazard and has no gender.”(* names changed)",chennai,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74370818,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-611209,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/more-women-hit-bottle-want-to-kick-the-habit/articleshow/74347703.cms

Ongoing work at Shivajinagar underground metro station. (File photo)

PUNE: The civil work of all the five underground Metro stations on the 5km stretch between Agriculture College and Swargate has started.

The Maharashtra Metro Rail Corporation Limited (MahaMetro) said it had begun excavation at two crucial sites — Budhwar Peth and Mandai stations — in the past few days. The ground work of Civil Court and Shivajinagar stations is in advanced stage. The work on Swargate station — the fifth and the last station on the route — started this week.

The Swargate station will be constructed using the New Austrian Tunnelling Method (NATM) because it is at the end of the tunnel. A plan was finalised recently on how to initiate the work.

A senior official from MahaMetro said, “We have started the tunnelling work from the Agriculture College-end with two tunnel boring machines. There is a plan to expedite the work of the underground stations. The locations of all the five stations have been finalised. The MahaMetro had to change the site of Budhwar Peth station from its earlier location because of opposition from the residents of the area. The plan for the new site is now ready.”

The Civil Court station would be an interchange station because two Metro lines Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC)-Swargate and Vanaz-Ramwadi would converge there. The underground and overhead stations would be constructed in the same building structure. MahaMetro has initiated the work for the underground station.

Officials from MahaMetro stated that the tunnelling and construction work of stations would progress simultaneously. “We have prepared a plan in such a way that both the works can go on. The tunnel boring machine that started the tunnelling work from Agriculture College has reached near the site of Shivajinagar station. Though the station work is yet to be finished, the tunnelling work will not stop. Coordination will be maintained in both the works. The machines will be pulled out from Mandai instead of Budhwar Peth,” an official said.

All the underground stations are located about 20 metres below the ground. Every station will have entry-exit points from the ground level.

MahaMetro said the commuters would be able to reach the concourse-level using staircases and elevators. Sites for entry-exit points have been identified for all the stations.

PUNE: Spreading awareness against novel coronavirus COVID-19 ) infection should be the government’s mantra at the moment when quite a few neighbouring countries are scrambling to contain the contagion spread, experts said on Thursday.“The knee-jerk reactions, we are used to, unfortunately won’t work when it comes to containing the virus when it strikes,” senior public health expert Subhash Salunke, the former director general of Maharashtra’s public health department, said.He said though no positive case had been found in Maharashtra, the authorities should avoid any laxity. “We should make most of the current period to reach out to common people and sensitise them. Educating the masses when the virus is already in community is just like digging a well when one is thirsty,” Salunke said.Making judicious and extensive use of mass media tools, including newspapers, radio and television, among others, can make a huge difference in creating awareness. “What a household should do when a family member is diagnosed with the infection ? How other members can remain safe? What are common dos and don’ts when the virus enters the community? People should know how basic measures like frequent washing of hands and personal hygiene practices like coughing and sneezing etiquette can help immensely in fighting the virus,” Salunke said.Medical practitioner and health activist Abhijit More said, “The main thrust is presently on screening the travellers returning from the affected countries, following up with them, isolating those complaining of minor illness and testing them for the coronavirus infection. But the focus on disseminating information to the masses, creating awareness and educating them via media is sourly lacking. If we fail to make the most of the current time when there is no positive case, we may have to face similar havoc and chaos that ensued when swine flu had claimed country’ first victim in Pune in August 2009.”Activist Sanjay Dabhade said, “The World Health Organisation has urged countries to “prepare for a potential pandemic” – an epidemic that spreads throughout the world. Pakistan and Nepal also detected their first cases of the contagion, days after shutting border with Iran, which has also emerged as a major coronavirus spot.”Infectious diseases expert Sudhir Patsute, head of the Naidu Infectious Diseases Hospital that is the only designated isolation facility in Pune, said, “ China imposed extraordinary quarantine measures in several cities, locking in tens of millions of people as it sought to curb the rapid spread of the virus.

Representative image

CHENNAI: In a major setback to Tangedco and the Tamil Nadu government, the Union ministry for renewable power (MNRE) has cancelled the proposal for a solar park at Kadaladi in Ramanathapuram district . The decision was made at a meeting convened by the MNRE secretary recently to assess the performance of solar parks. The reason for cancellation, sources said, was tardy progress in its implementation.

It was in 2017 that the government announced that a 500 MW solar photovoltaic park would come up at Kadaladi. Former CM J Jayalalithaa had in 2016 announced a 4,000MW thermal power plant at the same site. Problems in obtaining environmental clearance for the thermal power plant is what prompted the state government to shift to the solar park, said sources. When the government announced the setting up of the Kadaladi solar park, it had claimed that the park would be the first ever to be set up by any discom. But even after three years, there was no progress on the project . Even land acquisition is not complete, said officials.

Tangedco representatives did not attend the recent review meeting convened by the MNRE secretary. “We were not aware of the meeting. Our information is that the Union government cancelled the project as no one representing Tangedco attended the review meeting. The decision came as a surprise to us,” a senior Tangedco official told TOI. “Solar Energy Corporation of India (SECI) had offered to invest and develop the solar project on land to be provided by Tangedco on build-own-operate (BOO) basis. Tangedco would have got 100% of power generated by the park,” said the official.

Tangedco plans to approach MNRE to reconsider its decision to cancel the project. “A lot of ground work has been done to identify the land, measuring about 1,500 acres,” said the official.

This is the second setback for Tangedco in recent times. In December last, Union power minister R K Singh wrote a letter to chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswami stating that it will be difficult for PFC and REC to provide loans based on the present financial situation of Tangedco. Around 5,000MW of thermal and solar power projects will get stuck if funding stops.

Nagpur: Speaker Nana Patole directed municipal commissioner Tukaram Mundhe to expedite works and projects obtained from the Nagpur Improvement Trust (NIT).

Patole, who unsuccessfully contested the Lok Sabha elections from the city and was later elected as MLA from Bhandara district, held a meeting to review works related to Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC), NIT and MahaMetro at Vidhan Bhavan, Mumbai, on Friday.

Urban development minister Eknath Shinde, Backward classes minister Vijay Wadettiwar, West Nagpur MLA and Congress City President Vikas Thakre, Mundhe, NIT chairman Sheetal Teli-Ugale and officials of the urban development department were present.

Patole reviewed works and projects transferred from NIT to NMC after the state government declared NMC as the sole planning authority of the city in August last year. He asked Mundhe to ensure that projects from the NIT are not affected.

Thakre demanded total dissolution of NIT soon. He said people are confused as NIT is still functioning in the city.

During the regime of the leader of opposition Devendra Fadnavis as CM, government had removed the planning authority status of NIT and made NMC as the sole planning authority of the city. But the government is yet to hand over NIT’s land bank, funds and other responsibilities and liabilities to the NMC. Therefore, NIT is still functioning.

Patole also gave some directions to MahaMetro officials.

385,['28/02/2020'],"This Lent, an appeal to take trolling off menu","This story is from February 28, 2020

Stephen says he feels refreshed after he gave trolling a break

CHENNAI: After Pope Francis said it, and then his own parish priest reiterated it, Stephen Arputha Raja decided he was going to give the “no trolling for lent” appeal from the Roman Catholic Church a go. So on Thursday, the 23-year-old BPO employee from Chennai refrained from trolling friends and strangers on Twitter and Facebook.

“It was difficult,” says Stephen. Especially since, as he says, he jumps at every chance to pass a snide remark or poke fun at a person online, sending out at least 40 comments a day. On Thursday, he said nothing. But admits he felt something. “Refreshed, happy, like there was a weight off my shoulders.”

On Ash Wednesday, as part of his customary message for the season of Lent – for Christians, the 40-day period of reflection and preparation before the celebration of Easter, usually marked fasting, both from food and festivities – Pope Francis urged people to stop being internet trolls and insulting “each other as if they were saying, Good Day”. Pope Francis too, incidentally, has been the target of online trolls himself.

In his Lenten message, Father Michael A D of the Chengelpet Diocese, where Stephen is a member, said the internet, which is a good thing in itself, has become a space for verbal violence. “This lent, I’ve urged the parish to fast from electronic gadgets, from forwarding unauthorised messages, from mob mentality, intolerance, from passing unnecessary hurtful comments,” says Fr Michael.

Other parish priests too are trying to take the message of the Pope forward. To his congregation in Kilachery, for instance, besides the issue of trolling and the excessive use of social media, Father Praveen M W asked his parish to refrain from forwarding fake news. “This Lenten season, begin to verify, then forward.”

The Pope’s message is relevant from a mental health perspective as well, say experts. Consultant psychiatrist Dr Vinayak Vijayakumar says with trolling there appear mental health issues from the point of view of the troll as well as the person being trolled. “Those engaged in cyber bullying and trolling have been found to be six times more likely to be part of mental health forums. They also tend to exhibit reduced self-esteem. The ones at the receiving end of the trolling do tend to have anxiety,” says Dr Vijayakumar.“I have had celebrities for instance come to be facing mild depressive episodes or anxiety because of being trolled.”

Stephen though says he feels like a whole new person after day one of his troll-fast. “Usually, I never even bother to read people’s posts fully. I’m always looking at how I can troll them.

Guntur: A new variety of dry chilli with light gold colour arrived in Guntur market on Thursday.

The gold coloured chilli fetched Rs 14,000 per quintal—the highest price for dry chilli in recent history. The price went up as traders competed with each other to buy the gold-coloured stocks in Guntur agriculture market yard.

Market committee officials said that a farmer from Kurnool brought a few quintals of Bangaram stock which was sold out within no time. The popular brand of Teja variety is commanding a price of nearly Rs 9,000- Rs 10,000 per quintal for the past few days.

Sources said that gold colour chilli, known as Bangaram, is considered to be precious seed. The experts said that Bangaram chilli comes with high pungency level and it is expected to reap high price in export market. However, the Bangaram variety is cultivated only in select areas of Kurnool and Guntur districts, said AP Commission Merchants Association secretary P Suresh Reddy. Sources said that farmers were not taking risk to cultivate the variety as it is considered to be high sensitive seed and could not withstand viruses. In fact, the Teja variety, which has the highest demand in the market, is not being cultivated by all farmers due to high cost of cultivation.

Meanwhile, about 90,000 bags of dry chilli arrived in the agriculture market yard on Thursday. The yard handled a total stock of nearly 1.2 lakh bags on a single day.

The chilli arrival has picked up momentum in the last few days as season and picking operations have reached peak. “Normal varieties are fetching around Rs 90-Rs 110 per kg while premium varieties of Teja and Byadiga are around Rs 120-Rs 135 per kg,” said L Kranti Sekhar, a leading chilli trader.

Agriculture market committee chairman Ch Yesurathnam said it was relatively a good season for farmers as prices have not gone down during the peak sale season.

KOLKATA: As tunnelling for East-West Metro began under Bowbazar after a hiatus of 170 days, fresh cracks appeared in some houses on Thursday, claimed residents. Engineers of Kolkata Metro Rail Corporation ( KMRC ), the implementing agency of the project, visited the affected houses and promised to repair the cracks and ensure no damage was done afresh.Though the tunnel boring machine has been moving slowly and digging less than 10m a day and implementing agency Kolkata Metro Rail Corporation (KMRC) has been taking all safety measures to avoid a repeat of the tunnelling disaster, some residents alleged the borer’s movement had already started taking a toll on their houses. TOI visited 11, Chaitan Sen Lane, where Aditya Dutta, who is appearing for this year’s ICSE, pointed at a hairline crack at the corner of his study. “The crack wasn’t here earlier. We noticed it four or five days ago,” he said. His father, Sukalyan Dutta, sounded anxious: “As you can see, our house is well maintained. The interiors are painted every September because we have Durga Puja in the house. The cracks you saw upstairs are new.”KMRC sent a team of engineers to inspect the houses on Thursday evening. “Even though the TBM has not passed below these buildings yet, we are carrying out inspection to check for any kind of settlement. We shall repair the cracks accordingly,” a KMRC spokesperson said.East-West tunnelling resumed on February 18, 170 days after one of the TBMs on August 31 hit an aquifer, which flooded the west-bound tunnel under Bowbazar, leading to largescale subsidence and collapse of multiple buildings in quick succession. Around 700 residents had to be evacuated during that time. This is the last leg of tunnelling for one of the most ambitious infrastructure project of the city slated for completion by March, next year.Dutta said his house was spared when TBM Chundee, which was digging the west-bound tunnel, ran into an aquifer last August. “I am aware that TBM Urvi is digging along the line of houses on the opposite side of the street. But we can’t help linking the new cracks to Urvi’s movement,” Dutta said.The Basaks of 10, Chaitan Sen Lane, too, claimed some of the cracks in their house were due to the second TBM’s movement. The house was badly damaged during the August-31 disaster and KMRC repaired it. “Cracks have again surfaced during the current tunnelling,” said Kajol Basak. His wife, Mitra, said, “My son’s study has cracks all over.”",kolkata,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74383998,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-162738,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/new-cracks-surface-in-bowbazar-homes-kmrc-allays-concerns/articleshow/74347822.cms

TIRUPATI: Thirty-three year old Derangula Krishna Mohan attempted to abduct a 21-year-old at Kadapa on Wednesday but was thwarted by the police in time.

Addressing the media, police said that Mohan started off as an assistant professor at a private college and later became a ward secretary in Fakirpalli ward. He fell in love with the girl who studied in the same college. When the girl moved to Bengaluru, Mohan followed her there. Fed up with him, her parents brought her home.

On Wednesday, when her parents were not at home, Mohan entered the house wearing a burqa and abducted her.

Alert neighbours, who saw Mohan, informed the parents, who in turn called the police. Both the parents and the police reached the house to find bones and a skull, a burning candle next to a LPG cylinder and the girl’s spare dress drenched in petrol. Mohan, police said, wanted to stage an accident and make it appear as if the girl died in the fire accident.

DSP Suryanarayana formed two teams and rushed them to Nellore and Vellore (in Tamil Nadu ). Using technology, the accused was traced near Vellore railway station and was arrested around noon on Thursday.

389,['28/02/2020'],Hundreds of Indian fishers stranded in Iran seek help to return,"This story is from February 28, 2020

Madurai: The Covid-19 outbreak and halting of flights by Gulf countries have left hundreds of Indian fishermen stranded in Iran who are pleading to the Government of India to fly them home just as it airlifted Indians from Wuhan and Yokohama.

“There should be about 800 to 900 Indian fishermen in Iran, of which about 700 are from Kanyakumari,” M Sahaya Askar, one of the nearly 350 fishermen stranded at Zero fishing harbour, told TOI. “We are in fear, not going for fishing, clueless about our return and desperately in need of help,” he said. Other than Zero, Kish Island and Asaluyeh are the fishing harbours where Indian fishermen work in large numbers. Indian fishermen are also employed in Lava Island, Kamku and Staraq in smaller numbers.

“We were initially told that corona virus had spread to places that are a few hundred kilometres from Zero. Yesterday we were told that it is as close as 160 kms. Our employers are ready to relieve us but we don’t have flights to return. We have limited food supplies and are managing with it on our boats,” Askar added. The fishermen said they are dependent on connecting flights from Iran to one Gulf country or the other to fly to India. For those in Zero, it is an hour by boat to Kish and to the airport in 10 to 15 minutes on road to fly to Dubai and then to India.

The journey through Tehran is more time-consuming. “We have to take a connecting flight to Qatar or Saudi Arabia and then fly to India. Now, all neighbouring countries have cut off their flights to Iran due to Covid-19 oubreak. Please help us return home,” pleaded another fisherman. Jelastin Mary, 47, of Arockiapuram is worried about her sons Arun Prasad (27) and Sahaya George Vijayan (25). “Arun is working there for a year and Vijayan went there only six days ago. The poison (virus) is spreading quickly by air. So please bring my sons here soon,” she said.

Kemila, 47, the mother of 27-year-old M Sahaya Dinesh, said he got married only four months ago and had gone to Iran for the first time. “He said fever and virus are spreading there and that they have not been to work and there is no proper food. We want him back home safely,” she said. “We have lots of dreams about our wedding and future. Please bring him alive soon before he and his friends get affected by corona virus,” says 20-year-old Princa, the fiancé of fisherman M Alden, 24. Most of them are in their early 20s and are the breadwinners of their families.

Charles Johnson, the secretary of Meenavar Orunginaipu Sangam, said they have brought up the matter before fisheries officials in Chennai. “We are taking stock of the number of Tamil Nadu fishermen in Iran and the pressing issues that have to be addressed. If there are no flights we want the men to be rescued by sea,” he said. Fisheries director G S Sameeran told TOI that they are aware of the crisis and are in touch with the Indian high commission in Iran to take stock of the number of fishermen. He said they will write to the ministry of external affairs if needed to airlift them.

KOLKATA: IIT Kharagpur ’s civil engineering department is conducting a study to improve safety of pedestrians and drivers and improve traffic management within six month.“The survey, done on behalf of state’s urban development department, has been going on for the last two weeks. The researchers are evaluating various parameters like road safety, use of signals by pedestrians and drivers, etc,” said Bhargab Maitra from the IIT. He said, “We are consulting various stakeholders like KMDA, KMC, transport department, Kolkata Police and Bidhannagar Police as well as Metro authorities for the safety audit of Bypass. We are focusing on 25 intersections between Ultadanga and Garia so that Bypass can be a model road.”“We are also auditing the bus stops and the sheds at the bus stands and how they are used by passengers,” Maitra said. He added that as they will submit their report within three months.“We are also checking the accident-prone zones. Chingrighata is one such spot, for which we are trying to find solutions. The study is being conducted both in the morning and at night. At night, poor illumination, blocked road signs and potholes are major issues. Motorists bypassing signals and jaywalkers are also being looked into.”Maitra further said that the standard of the survey will be similar to the one that the institute conducted on national highways. “The researchers will suggest inexpensive changes with little change to the infrastructure after the study is complete. He pointed out that pedestrians lack proper access to the bus stop in front of Paribahan Bhavan .“In some places, the pavements, which need cleaning and better illumination, are not used by the pedestrians. Proper design of the service roads and pavements where they merges with the Bypass can reduce accidents. The median is also being studied as people are seen scaling it to cross over to avoid walking longer distance,” Maitra said.On Thursday evening, five IIT researchers — Saurabh Dandapat, Kinjal Bhattacharyya, Sudipa Chatterjee, Kaustubh Saysardar and Dipanjan Mukherjee — stood at the VIP Bazar crossing to jot down adherence to traffic signals and the behaviour pattern of the pedestrians. They noticed that the road signs were not properly visible as with shops had encroached upon the roads and pavement. Dandapat showed that crossing the road at that point was a tough task in the absence of a zebra crossing. Moreover, hazard markers on the Metro infrastructure were not properly visible at all the spots.Bhattacharyya pointed out that the subways near Science City were underused, though motorists followed traffic laws at that junction.",kolkata,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74381306,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-263526,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/iit-kgp-focuses-on-em-bypass-to-make-it-safer/articleshow/74347817.cms

Representative image

CHENNAI: All India Council for Technical Education ( AICTE ) has made eight online courses mandatory for new faculty members and faculty members with less than five years of experience in technical institutions.

Called national initiative for technical teachers training, the courses include orientation towards technical education and curriculum aspects, professional ethics and sustainability, communication skills, modes and knowledge dissemination, instructional planning and delivery, technology enabled learning, life long self-learning, student assessment and evaluation, creative problem solving, innovation, institutional management and administrative procedures.

In a recent circular, AICTE said the courses have been made mandatory to new inductee teachers and teachers with less than five years experience in the gazette notification for seventh pay commission scale salary. “It is requested that maximum new inductee teachers and teachers with less than five years of experience be advised to register under this initiative,” the circular said.

Roughly, up to 25% faculty members in tier-1 engineering colleges and more than 50% of faculty members in tier-2 and tier-3 engineering colleges in the state will have less than five years experience.

“We have made it mandatory for all faculty members in our college with less than five years to finish the online courses. For faculty members above five years we have made it as on optional training programme,” said B Chidambararajan, principal of Valliammai Engineering College.

“The faculty members are undergoing various online training programmes as the same was linked with pay hike. But these courses are offered subsidised fees. AICTE also should consider offering these courses for a subsidised fee,” he added.

The faculty members need to pay Rs 2,000 as registration fee and Rs 1,000 for each of the eight modules.

Maluk Mohamad, chairman of MAM College of Engineering and Techology in Trichy, said teachers would take it seriously if the fee is fixed for online course. “AICTE is not asking the teachers to get extra degree. The candidates are spending lakhs of rupees for UG and PG programmes. It is not a big amount,” he said.

Faculty members said the course fee of Rs10,000 is almost one month salary for new faculty members.

“New faculty members and faculty members are receiving around Rs 10,000 a month. It would be difficult for them to pay the amount. AICTE should make it free for the faculty members till it ensures pay as per the seventh pay commission scale of pay,” said K M Karthik, president of Private Educational Institutions Employees Association.

Nagpur: Tribals facing hardships in the shadow of Naxalism and unscrupulous politicians exploiting the situation to the hilt for personal gains was effectively portrayed by the employees of Maharashtra Housing and Area Development Authority (Mhada) in Marathi drama ‘Ulgulan’ at Dr Vasantrao Deshpande Hall on Wednesday.

Led by Bhiva (Sudhir Wankhede), the tribals try to usher in a revolution (ulgulan) and lead a happy and peaceful life. But in Naxal-infested areas, development does not come so easily. Bhiva pitches for development and raises voice against the injustice meted out to the adivasis. But his voice is stifled.

The story unfolds with flashback sequences in which struggles of tribal people are highlighted. In between Anna (Anant Dhole) wants to set up a paper industry to which the tribals are opposed.

When Bhiva takes up the development issue, Naxals, wily Anna and some corrupt police officials conspire against him. Bhiva is imprisoned on flimsy grounds though his wife Chanda (Dakshata Gone) stands by him so also the tribals, but in vain.

As the play progresses, solo dance ‘Tipura tipura’ catches eyes. The composition of song highlighted various aspects of a well-settled locality that the tribals dream to live in. But that is not to be.

Group dance on the song ‘Aamhi adivasi re’ depicts the indomitable spirit of tribals who always try to lead a happy life despite facing adversities. Songs and dance of adivasis was a treat to watch.

With tribals engaged in routine work, Bhiva is released from jail which raises their hopes that there will be a dawn in their life. But the jubilation does not last long as Anna incites Durga, who is hostile to tribals. An angry Durga opens fire at tribals and silences them forever, leaving the audience stunned.

The play, written by Harshad Salve and directed by Danish Khan, painted the stark reality of tribal life. They were inspired by the book ‘Goomfan’, written by Shivkumar Aney.

The government in the tabled reply said that of the 261 schools with playgrounds, 173 are in Narmada and 20 each are in Tapi and Botad. Another 19 schools in Porbandar were given playground facility. Opposition leader Paresh Dhanani said that as on December 31, 2019, 4,612 schools did not have playground facility. “If we add 261 schools which have been given this facility in the past two years, the figures become 4,873. But, the government on December 31, 2017 had stated that 7,209 schools have no playgrounds,” he said.

“The number has come down drastically. The Congress party will demand a discussion on the present number of 4,612. We will demand a discussion for presenting wrong figures in the assembly. As per rules, the government will have to permit discussion on the issue,” said Dhanani.

NEW DELHI: On the roads of certain areas of Shiv Vihar you will not spot a soul. While everyone’s attention has been on the key riot zones like Chand Bagh, Gokulpuri and Maujpur-Jafrabad, areas surrounding Phase 8 and 9 in Shiv Vihar along the Loni border have the eerie look of abandoned habitations.More than 3,000 houses lie abandoned, hundreds have been ransacked. The untended shops and factories of the deserted Shiv Vihar were being looted even when TOI visited the area on Thursday evening. Sudha Devi, 45, one of the few Hindu residents of the area, alleged that police and the city administration had forsaken them. “Where were you when gas cylinders were being used to burn down houses here?,” she asked, her eyes surveying the half burnt houses and charred skeletons of cars.Devi’s husband, a transport department employee, said the family has moved in with relatives in Shanti Nagar. “A crowd of more than 2,000 burnt down these houses on Monday night. It was a nightmare,” he shuddered, adding, “Bhagwan na kare kabhi kisi ke sath ab aisa ho.” The only reason they were in Shiv Vihar was to save their house from arsonists.A mixed locality dominated by Muslims, the houses there still had smoke billowing out on Thursday. Two places of worship were damaged, with the shells of exploded cylinders lying there a tell-tale sign. Rioters, in particular, targeted religious inscriptions. Gaurav Kumar said that all the Muslims had left the colony. “There is no one to talk to even,” the dejected man said, glancing at the charred remains of his neighbours’ houses.A Muslim family, hurrying to leave the area, did not want to say anything. “There is nothing for us here now. We will start our lives somewhere else,” one of the women said. Their voices were the only sound save for the cawing of crows on the entire 25-Foota Road, where some houses had ‘Jai Shri Ram’ scrawled on their doors, obviously to save themselves from the rioters.One landlord talked of his tenants for the past 15 years. “Saleem Sahab and his family packed their bags and left when passions started to intensify on Monday. I never had any problem with them. But seeing what is left now, it is good they left for Bijnor,” he remarked. The water and electricity supply remain cut.Residents said that despite the presence of the Rapid Action Force, there still is fear. “The security personnel are on the main road, not on the interior lanes. It has been four days since we slept properly,” said Gaurav Kumar’s father. “When it turns dark, we sit outside our houses because inside we won’t even come to know if someone comes to burn the house down. At least outside we can run to safety.”The many bakeries in the area were owned by Muslims who had employed mostly Hindu workers and salesman. Ram Kumar, a supply agent for the bakeries, said he had surely lost his source of income with the bakeries all lying shuttered now. He looked dejectedly at children helping themselves to rusks at a bakery he once worked for.Read this story in Bengali",delhi,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74366890,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-238919,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/ghost-town-3000-abandoned-houses-in-shiv-vihar/articleshow/74347873.cms

Northeast Delhi is slowly trying to move on from the horrors of the last few days.

NEW DELHI: With some grocery shops having reopened, damaged electrical lines being restored, metro stations functioning and at least a few people starting to go about their daily chores, northeast Delhi is slowly trying to move on from the horrors of the last few days.

Roads leading to Jafrabad and Maujpur-Babarpur were visibly more active on Thursday. Shops selling essential commodities opened and vegetable and fruit vendors could be seen moving around. However, the pall of gloom persisted.

Other riot-affected areas, such as Chand Bagh, Mustafabad, Kabir Nagar and Kardampuri, also saw a semblance of normalcy. Maujpur Chowk, which was until Wednesday occupied by police, was bustling with activity. On Maujpur main road, medical shops opened in the morning.

A shopkeeper, Sunil Tyagi, told TOI: “I opened my shop after three days...many people were calling me with urgent requirements. We don’t have enough stocks though. I plan to down the shutters at 1.30pm. I will take a call later about reopening in the evening.”

At another shop, senior citizens queued up for medicines. Painkillers were most in demand. Paramilitary forces were stationed in heavy numbers in the inner lanes. Some local traders from both communities could be seen serving refreshments to them. Shashank Sharma (25), a resident of Maujpur, said they were thankful to the forces for restoring normalcy.

Rajesh Sharma, who owns a garment shop, said rumours were giving them sleepless nights. “After a generator caught fire near a market in Maujpur, it triggered rumours of arson.” At several places in Maujpur, Shiv Vihar and Gokulpuri, officials were busy restoring the damaged power lines. “Some poles have been burnt down, while at other points arsonists cut off the lines,” a BSES official said.

At a bangle shop, Hema Bisht was seen shopping for a relative’s wedding. “No one could come for the pre-wedding celebrations. We couldn’t even purchase anything as shops and roads were shut. I have come out today to buy bangles for the bride,” she said.

On the other side of the canal in Kabir Nagar, some shops had reopened. In Chand Bagh, people ventured out on the streets. Police prevented crowds from gathering. The narrow alleys leading from the arterial road between Chand Bagh and Karawal Nagar, which had been blocked by locals, were being opened again. An earthmover was being used to clear the rubble and glass shards.

However, uncertainty still haunted those affected by the riots. “My shop was torched and I lost most of my belongings. I have no insurance. How will I rebuild my life?” asked a distressed Bhure Khan, a shop owner who sold fruits and other utilities.

Shama Parween, a 45-year-old widow who stitches clothes for a living in Chand Bagh, showed her plastered left foot. “I cannot use the sowing machine right now. I have a house to run and three children to feed. A neighbourhood doctor treated me and told me to keep the plaster on for at least a month. How will I earn a livelihood?” she asked.

An East Delhi Municipal Corporation spokesperson said that debris and burnt vehicles were being removed. “We are giving priority to the least-affected areas so that our officials are not attacked and equipment damage. That can demoralise the workers,” he added.

Cops during a similar penalty-waiver drive early last year

KOLKATA: The state government has offered 100% waiver on penalty on tax of any kind accrued by any vehicle, if the amount is paid within March 31. Moreover, the transport department is also offering a waiver of 50% of the compounding amount for the motor-vehicle offences, irrespective of date of when it was committed, imposed by the enforcement authority (police or motor vehicle inspectors), if it is paid within the same deadline. The scheme was kicked off on Thursday.

The period for waiver on the pending fitness certificate cases of vehicles has also been extended from February 29 to March 31. The state government could mop up a revenue of Rs 64 crore from fitness certificate fees alone by offering the waiver on the penalty against non-compliant vehicles.

More than 1 lakh vehicles have undergone fitness test since January, said a transport department officer.

Apart from providing errant vehicle owners relief, the settlement schemes can help the state mop a considerable amount of revenue. According estimates, Rs 800 crore is due only on account of road tax against the commercial and non-commercial vehicles in the state.

Bus and minibus owners need to pay road tax every three months. Owner of a non-AC bus pays Rs 1,516 while that of a minibus pays Rs 1,100 every quarter. If the road tax is pending for one quarter, the penalty will be 100% of the actual amount and if it is pending for more than that, it is 200%. Thus, the pending road tax becomes a huge liability, which most of the operators fail to pay. This is why bus operators were demanding a waiver scheme, said Tapan Banerjee, secretary of the joint council of bus syndicates.

MADURAI: A farmer, who was unable to repay a loan he had obtained from a private bank a few years ago, allegedly committed suicide in Theni on Thursday.

Police said Dharmalingam, 52, of Sirapparai village in Theni district obtained a loan of Rs 12 lakh from a private bank a few years ago. He couldn’t repay the loan as he had faced heavy losses in agriculture. Two days ago Dharmalingam received a notice from the bank stating that his house would be attached if he failed to repay his loan. His family told police that he had been forlorn since then and consumed pesticide two days ago. He was admitted to the Theni Government Hospital, but he died later.

399,['28/02/2020'],Depriving a person of liberty can’t be left to whims of police: HC,"This story is from February 28, 2020

Nagpur: Coming down heavily on the illegal detention of a father-son duo, Nagpur bench of Bombay high court slapped a fine of Rs2.20 lakh on a Wardha police inspector (PI). It also tersely observed that “depriving a person of his liberty guaranteed by Article 21 of the Constitution of India can’t be left to the whims and wishes of the police officer”.

“If (illegal detention) is permitted, it would be conferring arbitrary and unbridled powers on the police authorities. Knowledge of the police officer about design to commit any cognisable offence by a person has to be reflected from the record, showing the details of proposed preventive action against that person,” the HC observed, before directing authorities to record its observations in the PI’s service book.

There was a dispute over petitioner Kishor Futane’s trusteeship, and his post as secretary at Shri Mirannath Maharaj Deosthan at Deoli in Wardha district. This was pending before the authorities under Maharashtra Public Trusts Act since 2013-14.

On December 25, 2013, a report was lodged at Deoli police station against Futane, alleging that he tried to break open the trust’s cupboard to take away documents. Another report was lodged on January 19, 2014, against him and his son Dr Indraprasad, claiming that they were examining trust documents in its office and also abused the complainant. After enquiry, the police authorities found that the offences were non-cognizable in both complaints.

On February 5, 2014, Deoli police inspector Dhananjay Sayare suddenly initiated action under Section 151 (1) of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC) and detained the father-son duo for over seven hours, before they were released by the executive magistrate.

Terming themselves as reputed citizens, the aggrieved petitioners moved HC contending that their detention was illegal and “abuse of power and authority” by Sayare and Burle.

The judges observed that police officer may take action as per CrPC Section 151(1) against a person only if he has knowledge of a design of commissioning of any cognisable offence, or if it appears to him that cognisable offence can’t be prevented unless preventive action is taken against the person who may commit it.

“The PI hasn’t pointed out anything from the record of having knowledge that the petitioners were designing to commit any cognisable offence. To say the least, the justification given for taking action as per CrPC is misleading and an attempt to cover up the illegal act. We find that the petitioners have suffered due to PI’s illegal and high handed action, which appears to be motivated,” the HC said.

WHAT HC SAID

* Petitioners suffered due to PI’s illegal & high handed action which appears to be motivated

* If (illegal detention) permitted, it would confer arbitrary & unbridled powers on police officers

* Police officer should have record of knowledge of design to commit cognisable offence

* Justification given for taking action as per CrPC is misleading & an attempt to cover up illegal act

* Except two reports against petitioners, nothing is placed on record to justify preventive action

* Petitioners should submit affidavit if they wish to donate Rs2.20 lakh to Mirannath Maharaj Trust

400,['28/02/2020'],Justice Haq takes charge at Aurangabad,"This story is from February 28, 2020

Nagpur: Scores of city lawyers heaved a sigh of relief after Justice Zaka Haq finally took charge at Aurangabad bench of Bombay high court from Monday. He is heading the division bench also having justice SM Gavhane, as per the lawyers.

On first day of his sitting, he granted a relief to a 78-year-old retired labourer, Sambha Jondale, who was earlier working with Vasantrao Naik, Marathawada Krushi Vidyapith in Parbhani, by directing the government to release his pensionary benefits.

Upset by sudden transfer by former chief justice Pradeep Nandrajog, the city judge was reluctant to take up the new post and even went on long leave till further notice. There were speculations that he may even resign, which led to protest by the lawyers, including senior ones like former advocate general Shreehari Aney, senior counsels like Surendra Kumar Mishra, Anil Mardikar, Anand Jaiswal apart from noted ones Firdos Mirza, Shreerang Bhandarkar and others.

According to lawyers, Justice Haq took up the new assignment on same day when former CJ retired, and city-based Justice Bhushan Dharmadhikari took up the charge being the senior most in the hierarchy.

“Since, Justice Haq had joined the new post and the new CJ has assumed charge from this week, we will wait for some positive outcome. We have high expectations from the new CJ, who’s native of the city and is well familiar with Justice Haq. We have therefore decided to hold our protests against the judge’s abrupt transfer to Aurangabad,” the lawyers told TOI.

Enraged over Justice Nandrajog’s move, even the High Court Bar Association (HCBA) here had passed a resolution protesting against the judge’s transfer. Over 300 lawyers had signed a resolution on January 21 and HCBA office-bearers handed it over to former CJ in Mumbai in presence of Aney in first week of this month.

However, the CJ defended his decision stating that he wanted a dynamic lawyer at the Aurangabad bench who could also effectively look after Public Interest Litigations (PILs), besides regular civil and criminal cases. TOI has been following the issue with series of reports since HCBA passed resolution.

After CJ’s refusal to cancel Justice Haq’s transfer, the lawyers restarted their protests on February 17 where over 500 of them tied white bands on their coats in the first session. They had planned to intensify the protests in coming days while terming the transfer as “humiliation” for entire legal fraternity from the city. “But those were put on hold for few days, on hopes that new CJ would take an “appropriate decision”. In Aurangabad, he would be at fifth position and retire in May 2021 in same position. In Nagpur, he would retire on second position,” the lawyers said.

401,['28/02/2020'],Delay in payment of paddy procurement price alleged,"This story is from February 28, 2020

Madurai: Farmers in Madurai district have alleged that paddy procurement centres established by the government have not yet paid the dues amounting to Rs 35 crore for the procurement made from them nearly a month ago.

The issue was raised in the farmers grievance meeting held at the Madurai district collectorate on Wednesday. Paddy was cultivated in 38,235 hectares in the district last season, and 1.5 tonne was harvested from 32,000 hectares. Ravi, a farmer from Kottakudi, said that they had not been given their dues for the procured paddy for over a month. He was told that payments had been made for paddy procured till February 16, but the farmers claimed that payment has not been made for paddy procured on February 3.

Farmers in Melur alleged that the procurement process was getting delayed and their paddy bags were lying in the open without any protection. “The skies turned cloudy on Wednesday evening, and we prayed that it would not rain because, the slightest drizzle could result in our paddy sprouting and going waste,” said Sethu, a farmer from Melur. A demand was made at the grievance meet to increase the number of paddy procurement centres in Madurai.

Officials of the Tamil Nadu Civil Supplies Corporation said the number of centres had been increased to 100 from the previous 45 this year. The delay was due to lack of sufficient labour and problems with the transport, they said. Farmers also said that they had to pay about Rs 50 for each bag that they gave at the procurement centres.

Madurai collector Dr T G Vinay said that payment for the procured paddy had been given to 2,355 farmers till date and deposited in their bank accounts, the remaining amount would be deposited to 1,384 farmers in a week’s time.

AHMEDABAD: It was a teary-eyed moment for senior citizens at Jeevan Sandhya old age home in Naranpura on Thursday morning when they were handed kids ranging from a few weeks to a few years as part of ‘ adoption ’ initiative.

C K Patel, president of Ahmedabad District Probation and Aftercare Association that runs ‘Shishu Gruh’ - children home for the orphans - said that it was a novel experiment where the senior citizens who don’t get to live with their grandchildren, and the children who have not seen their grandparents, will find each other. “They have so much love to give and I am sure it would benefit both the groups emotionally,” he said.

The initiative was announced and commenced to coincide with 60th birthday of a city-based management thinker Shailesh Thaker, also a member of the association. “What could be a better event than a child getting his/her parents?” he said.

Officials at Jeevan Sandhya old age home said that distance from their families often make the senior citizens feel incomplete and doubt their roles in active society. “We are hopeful that with this initiative, they would feel that warmth - even for a few hours - to find purpose in life,” said an official.

403,['28/02/2020'],Jetty pumping station on Hooghly to solve water woes in Kidderpore,"This story is from February 28, 2020

Water drawn from the Hooghly will be sent to Watgunge treatment plant

KOLKATA: A new water intake pumping station constructed on a jetty on the Hooghly at Watgunge will take care of water scarcity in large areas of Kidderpore and Watgunge. The pumping station will draw water from the Hooghly and supply it to Watgunge water treatment plant. The plant will then carry out filtration process and finally potable water will be sent to several parts of Watgunge and Kidderpore.

According to an estimate, the new pumping station with a capacity to draw 15million gallons water in a day will be able to resolve water crisis in at least five wards and cater to at least 1.5 lakh people in Kidderpore and Watgunge. “We will inaugurate the intake jetty on Sunday. All we can say is that residents of Watgunge and Kidderpore will immensely benefit from the project,” a KMC water supply department official said. He added that once operational, the new intake pumping station will be instrumental in supplying potable water to five wards (75 to 80) four times a day. Now, the civic body supplies drinking water twice a day.

Construction of the jetty was planned following Kolkata Municipal Corporation’s decision to do away with ground water in the Watgunge-Kidderpore belt and augment supply of piped water in the area.

According to a KMC official, the new facility has some some unique features. “This is the first jetty-mounted intake pumping station designed for the city with a capacity to draw 15 million gallons of water per day. It will go a long way in mitigating water crisis not only in Kidderpore and Watgunge but large parts of Metiabruz also,” he said.

Explaining the advantages of such a pumping station, the official said since the intake pumping station was constructed on the river, the supply of raw water will never dry up. On the contrary, the station with a greater withdrawal capacity will be able to supply raw water according to demands of Watgunge water treatment plant and some other plants coming up in Kidderpore-Metiabruz areas,” said the official.

Sources in the KMC said the raw water to be drawn from the Hooghly will also be supplied to Manasatala water treatment plant once it’s ready and at least three capsule water booster pumping stations that will come up in the neighbourhood.

404,['28/02/2020'],Judge loses job for ‘sexist’ language during lecture,"This story is from February 28, 2020

NEW DELHI: Use of “highly sexist” language during a lecture for civil service probationers cost a judge his job as the Supreme Court upheld his compulsory retirement saying even a single aberration cannot be tolerated in the judiciary .

Though the allegations were levelled by 10 women civil service probationers years ago and the judicial officer had since got promotion, the apex court said past adverse record of a judge does not lose the sting at any stage and action can be taken on that basis. The judge had addressed the probationers as deputy director of the Administrative Training Institute in Ranchi.

A bench of Justices L Nageswara Rao and Deepak Gupta also took into account the allegation that the judge who was number two principle judge of the family court in Godda in Jharkhand had put a hot iron on the head of a washerman who had not ironed his clothes properly.

While upholding the Jharkhand High Court decision to compulsory retire the judge, the apex court went through the complaint filed by women probationers and found that the language used by him was “highly sexist”.

“There are two very serious allegations against him. The first is that when he was working as deputy director, Administrative Training Institute at Ranchi, as many as 10 women, who were civil service probationers, made allegations that he was using unwarranted and objectionable language during his lectures, citing indecent examples and using words having double meaning, thereby causing embarrassment. We have perused the complaints which are filed with the reply and the common refrain is that the language used by him during his lectures was highly sexist. There is also another allegation that he had physically hurt a washerman by placing a hot iron on the head of the washerman who had allegedly not ironed his clothes properly,” the bench said.

The court also upheld compulsory retirement for another judge whose integrity had been doubted more than once. The court noted that even his knowledge of law and procedures was found to be average and his relations with members of the Bar was found to be not very good.

“There are also allegations against him of having granted bail for illegal gratification and substance has been found in this allegation in the report of the judicial commissioner, Ranchi. The officer had granted bail by noting in the order that Section 327 of the Indian Penal Code , 1860 was bailable whereas the offence is non-bailable and an unrecorded warning regarding the integrity of the judicial officer was issued to him in 2012,” the bench said.

Challenging the administrative order of the HC, the judicial officers had contended that their entire service record, especially the contemporaneous record, had not been taken into consideration. They said they had been granted various promotions which would have the effect of “washing off” their previous adverse entries, if any.

But the court refused to accept their contention. “While considering the case of a judicial officer for compulsory retirement the entire record of the judicial officer should be taken into consideration, though the latter and more contemporaneous record must be given more weightage. Subsequent promotions do not mean that earlier adverse record cannot be looked into while deciding whether a judicial officer should be compulsorily retired,” the bench said.

MADURAI: Sivaganga District Sessions Judge Karthikeyan has awarded life sentence to 16 people in a murder case on Thursday. The incident relating to the murder happened in 2010. A group of men from Muthukulathor in Ramanathapuram district were staying in Sivaganga to set up sheep pens. Goats belonging to these men were allowed to graze on lands of farmers in Avarankadu in Sivaganga district.

As they had been staying on a land belonging to Muniyandi , they were allowed to graze their goats only on the lands of people specified by Muniyandi. Chandrakumar of Avarankadu had approached the men and asked them to bring their goats to his land. Muniyandi opposed this, following which trouble brewed between the supporters of Muniyandi and Chandrakumar.

On August 10, 2010, Chandrakumar and some of his kin including Alimuthu, 55, were talking in front of a shop. An 18-member gang including M Sekar, 39, M Poosaimani, 32, M Pandivel, 38, M Veerabathiran, 35, K Muniyandi, 61, V Alagupandi, 30, P Muniyandi, 23, C Palaniyandi, 40, T Rajangam, 45, B Prabu, 19, R Muthupandi, 23, P Rathi, 28, M Ramayee, 60, K Veerabathiran, 31, M Michael, K Ganeshan, 32, K Karuppiah, 63 and K Selvaraj, 35, attacked them with deadly weapons.

SMSN delegation handing over the memorandum of demands to CM Uddhav Thackeray on Wednesday

Nagpur: A delegation of the Save Merit Save Nation (SMSN) forum, affiliated to the Save Merit Foundation in the city, met chief minister Uddhav Thackeray in his office in Mumbai on Wednesday.

State president of SMSN, Dr Sanjay Deshpande, claimed that the meeting was positive. “I think the CM will understand the seriousness of this issue and render justice to the open category and meritorious students,” he said.

“Our team drew the CM’s attention towards the alarming situation in Maharashtra due to the increase in the percentage of reservation, which has escalated from 74% to 85% with further lateral reservations. The chief minister gave us a patient hearing after which we were assured that all the concerned departments would be given instructions to review the announcements made by the previous government,” added Deshpande.

The CM also assured the delegation that he would call for a meeting with SMSN activists soon. Shiv Sena MLC Gopikishan Bajoria from Akola coordinated the meeting with the CM.

“When Devendra Fadnavis was CM, he had called SMSN members for a confidence building meeting in July 2019. After the meeting, the state government had issued five GRs, including fee reimbursement for open category students who were forced to take admission in private colleges. We want these decisions to be implemented this year as well. It will provide at least some relief to merit students of the unreserved class,” said executive president of the forum Shreekrishna Buty.

The main demand of the SMSN forum is that reservation in education should have a maximum limit of 50% as capped by the supreme court. SMSN state office-bearers Utpala Mulawkar, Sachin Poshettiwar, Abhijeet Ambhaikar, Mahesh Karwa, R B Heda, Aparna Randive and Ashutosh Pradhan were part of the delegation.

AHMEDABAD: Two men who introduced themselves as crime branch personnel allegedly kidnapped a 27-year-old woman from Narol Road in an autorickshaw on Wednesday. Inspector of Isanpur police station, J M Solanki, said the woman is currently admitted in a hospital and still unconscious and unable to talk. They are hunting for the two accused, one of who had said his name was Rajbha and that he was from crime branch. Solanki said the woman had injuries from assault.

“If we find that the woman has also been assaulted sexually, we will add relevant sections of molestation or rape,” Solanki said.

The woman’s boyfriend, who lives in Bapunagar, has filed the FIR in the case. He stated that on February 26, he received a call from a friend who was an autorickshaw driver that while his girlfriend was travelling in his auto, two persons had intercepted them on Narol Road.

“One of them sat in his auto and said the woman has committed a theft and she needs to be taken to crime branch office at Gaekwad Haveli for identification. One of the men introduced himself as Rajbha, took the woman to an auto and asked the complainant’s friend to follow him,” said a police official.

The complaint states that they took the auto near NID Circle and told the complainant’s friend to wait for them and went away with the woman. “After about 15 minutes, one of the men called the auto driver and told him to leave and said that if wants the woman returned he will have to pay Rs 30,000 in the account he mentions,” police officials said.

The complainant’s friend then went back and along with the woman’s boyfriend searched for her at several places but as they could not find her they called up the police control room. “We searched for the women but couldn’t find her.

408,['28/02/2020'],Lift kara de: Homes installing elevators,"This story is from February 28, 2020

Nagpur: Demand for real estate is sagging and this should have hit the market for elevators too. On the contrary, demand for it is zooming up with residents choosing to fit it into not only newly built bungalows but even older independent houses.

A single company managed to sell 100 units last year in Nagpur and has upped its target by another 50 in the coming year. The overall national market of such lifts is pegged at 18,000 units a year, an industry growth projection of 20%.

Gaurav Agarawala, of Confederation of Real Estate Developers of India (CREDAI), said builders are seeing an overal revival in demand too. On elevators, he said a trend has been seen in “existing bungalows where lifts are being installed, especially if there are elderly in the home”.

The Chennai-head quartered Johnson Lifts and Escalators, which has a manufacturing unit here, has bagged an order worth Rs24 crore to make 104 lifts for the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) in Nagpur. It also expects a 50% boom in individual home building segment.

“The overall real estate demand through builders has gone down from 85% to 70% of the turnover, but our company is seeing a jump in orders for independent homes for elevators,” says Albert Dhiraviyam, the company’s country head (marketing). The company has launched a new product in the segment in the city.

Krishna Singhania, one of the buyers, said that he had installed a lift in his two-storied bungalow as his parents were old and had difficulty in climbing stairs. “Otherwise there was no need for a lift. This lift does not need a machine room. Its maintenance cost and power consumption is low,” he added.

Praful Rewatkar, another customer, said that many bungalow owners were installing lifts as they had become quite cheap. “The maintenance cost and power consumption are low. My parents are above 75 and if they want to go to the terrace they will need a lift. I am also above 50 and who knows I may need it someday,” he added.

Johnson’s Nagpur unit has a capacity to make 5,000 lifts a year. “At present over 4,000 are produced at the plant set up in the Butibori industrial estate in 2003,” said Dhiraviyam. “As against 1,000 lifts sold to individual homes, in the current financial year, our company expects to sell 1,500 in the coming fiscal.”

Nagpur too is seeing a similar growth, according to Sudhir Ghike, the plant’s regional manager here. “Last year the company clocked a sale of 100 lifts in the home segment which is expected to go up to 150 in the coming fiscal,” he said.

Johnson has also bagged orders to make lifts for AIIMS’ buildings in Guntur in Andhra Pradesh and Kalyan in West Bengal. Other major orders are from Metro rail projects in Mumbai and Pune.

Agra: The Aligarh police on Thursday issued “red notices” to 2,000 “anti-social” elements restricting their movement and asked another set of 2,000 to sign bonds as an assurance that they not breach peace, apparently apprehending trouble after the Friday prayers.

The district police also issued notices to another 200 people -- having criminal background-- under section 110 (G) of CrPc and initiated process of Goonda Act against 50 people.

Over 100 arm license holders, who are residents of Shahjamal, Jamalpur and Jeevangarh areas -- where anti-CAA protests are going on-- have also been issued warning notices, threatening cancellations of their licenses if they are caught in any trouble.

Mobile Internet services remained suspended in Aligarh for the fourth consecutive day on Thursday.

Aligarh SSP Muniraj G said, “Red notices were issued to 2,000 anti-social elements, informing them about restriction on their movement and 2,000 other people have been issued notices under section 107/116 of CrPC, asking them to sign bonds wherein they would undertake not to breach peace.”

The SSP said that police are on high alert and patrolling on highways has been intensified in view of the communal disturbances in the national capital.

“Additional police force including nine companies of PAC and four companies of RAF along with three additional SPs, eight deputy SPs and eight station house officers (SHO) of neighbouring districts have already been deployed in the city as a precautionary measure,” he said.

MADURAI: The city police have cracked the murder case of a 59-year-old woman that was committed in November 2015 by a gang of five boys aged 15 to 19 years.

While the prime accused M Kannan alias Oojadi Kannan (now 24 years old) was arrested on February 23 and four knives used in the offence recovered from him, police nabbed his accomplice M Vijay, 22, and R Chellapandi, 19 based on Kannan’s confession, on Tuesday. Two others Prem and Bala who were involved in the murder are already in jail for the last three months for their role in other cases in the city.The victim, R Suriyapriya was alone at her house in the afternoon, when the accused entered and inflicted 72 cut injuries all over her body and fled with the 17.5 sovereigns gold jewellery from her possession.

The case registered by the Keerathurai crime police as a murder for gain was tough to crack with no clue of the accused and was transferred to the ‘Serious Crime Squad’ of the city police four years ago. An officer who was part of the team said the accused who are from the same locality could not be traced as they fled to Coimbatore, Tirupur and other places for work when the police closed in on them.“All of them are school drop outs. Police inquired those who were close to them but the accused did not appear for inquiry too. Fearing arrest they split and worked in other places. But they were in touch over phone and used to meet here rarely when they came for the local temple festival,” he said.

“The arrested confessed that they watched the victim for a few days. On November 2, 2015, they saw her husband and son go to work, her daughter-in-law had gone to town for purchase and that she was alone. One of the accused stood guard in the ground floor to alert others. The four others murdered Suriyapriya and the gang fled with the loot,” the officer added. Kannan, Vijay and Chellapandi were produced before the court and lodged in jail. Prem and Bala will be taken into custody to record their statements.

Five Sri Lankan fishermen who entered Indian territorial waters were detained by the Indian Navy with the help... Read More

MADURAI: The Indian Navy on Thursday seized a Sri Lankan boat and arrested five fishermen from the neighbouring country who entered the Indian waters near Arichal Munai near Dhanushkodi in Ramanathapuram district. This is the second time in less than two weeks that a Indian Navy chopper from INS Parundu in Uchipuli has trapped the Sri Lankan fishermen when they tried to return after illegally entering the Indian waters.

The boat had crossed the International Maritime Boundary Line (IMBL) on Thursday morning was found by the chopper during a regular patrolling. Navy personnel from the chopper instructed the Lankan fishermen to head towards Arichal Munai.

Despite repeated warnings the boat tried to flee and attempted to cross the IMBL. Finally, the chopper flew at a very low height and prevented the boat from leaving the Indian waters and forced the boat to head towards Arichal Munai. The fishermen were quizzed by the Indian Navy personnel before the Mandapam marine police and intelligence agencies picked them up for questioning.

The five men have been identified as R Stephen Raj, 28, V Yesuraja, 46, T Uthayakumar, 40, Ravindiran, 29, and Kanapathipillai, 29, all from Talaimannar in Mannar district, Sri Lanka. They started from Talaimannar pier around 7am on Thursday and told the officials that they had come for fishing and were not involved in smuggling or acts of mischief.

Inquiry revealed that the fibre boat they used was very new and had a powerful engine, which is too high for a fishing boat. Contrary to the claim made by the fishermen, the investigating officials said there wasn’t any fish in the boat and the nets on the boat were also dry, with no hint of fishing activity. Customs officials took custody of the boat to search if they were smuggling gold, valuables or any contraband.

On February 15, a Navy chopper cornered a Lankan boat with three fishermen who crossed the IMBL and were within the Indian waters. They were forced to reach Arichal Munai. While they initially claimed that they had come to catch shoals of fish, inquiry revealed that they were smugglers and 3.5kg gold with 24 carat purity worth Rs 1.48 crore was seized from them. Four of their Indian accomplices were also arrested.

Sarbjot Kaur

NEW DELHI: Room no. 2343 at Delhi’s Apollo Hospital was witness to a rare exercise on Thursday — the conducting of Class X board exams. Sarbjot Kaur , a student of Mount Carmel in Hoshiyarpur who was diagnosed with a life-threatening illness three weeks ago, couldn’t go to her examination centre but insisted she wanted to give the exams.

Accepting her request, the ICSE board allowed her school to hold the exam in the hospital. Room no. 2343 was chosen and on Day 1, an examiner arrived there around the noon with the English question paper and answer sheets in a sealed envelope.

“During the exams, only the student and the examiner were allowed inside. A doctors’ team was on standby for any medical help but, fortunately, that wasn’t required,” said Dr Shishir Seth, senior consultant of haematology and bone marrow transplant at Apollo Hospital.

The next subject is mathematics, and the exam is on March 3. “We are hopeful that Kaur will be fit enough to be discharged by then and will be able to go to the examination centre. Otherwise, it may also be held here,” a senior official said.

Reham Kaur, the girl’s mother, said her daughter was among the toppers in the school. “She was preparing very hard for the exams, but suddenly fell ill. Tests revealed she has AML. She is undergoing treatment,” she said.

Acute myeloid leukemia is a life-threatening illness that starts in the bone marrow — the soft inner part of certain bones where new blood cells are made. The main treatment for most types of AML is chemotherapy, sometimes along with a targeted therapy drug. This may be followed by a stem cell transplant.

The mother added that the illness hadn’t been able to deter her daughter’s determination a bit. “I am sure she will do well in the exams. My daughter wants to become an IAS officer.”

The hospital authorities said the girl’s courage and determination in the face of a health crisis would be an inspiration for other patients, who, if diagnosed with critical illnesses, often lose hope. “We are happy to see this child pursuing her dreams despite all challenges,” said a senior doctor.

Madurai: Though Madras high court had restrained the company which had been collecting toll at the Vandiyur toll plaza, on the inner ring road in Madurai, from collecting it from 9 am on Thursday, the vehicles passing through it were asked to pay up as usual in the morning. However, after it was stopped in the evening traffic movement became smoother and easier.

The court had taken cognizance of the fact that the toll plaza did not have a separate lane for ambulances and other vehicles, which were exempted from toll, at the Vandiyur toll gate leading to chaos and traffic congestion. A division bench had passed the interim order while hearing a batch of petitions against collection of toll fee at three new toll plazas set up on the ring road in Madurai. They restrained the collection at the first toll gate at Vandiyur. Centre for Environmental Sciences founder S V Pathy said he passed through the Vandiyur toll plaza while going home to Gomathypuram from the Madurai airport on Thursday morning. “The bar was placed across and I was asked to pay the toll fee. When I told them that I had read that they should not collect fee at this gate, they told me it was a court matter and that they had been told to collect fees till further information,’’ he said

There is much chaos at this toll gate that they have personnel diverting the traffic on to the opposite lanes during heavy congestion on one side. As the gates opened in the evening, there was nobody manning the collection centres at the toll gate and traffic moved smoothly.tnn

414,['28/02/2020'],"To save tigress, cubs, trees chopped in Tadoba buffer","This story is from February 28, 2020

NAGPUR: Call it what you may — an irony of conservation or lack of physical protection measures — but the Tadoba-Andhari Tiger Reserve (TATR) had to resort to felling and trimming of trees in the buffer zone between Mudholi-Katwal on the western side of the park.

At a time when the Supreme Court has asked to recognize trees as living entities, tree felling and trimming close to Tadoba’s core has raised many eyebrows. Wildlife lovers are peeved to see the clearing of vegetation under the guise of trimming, in the 3km stretch between Mudholi-Katwal villages.

According to official sources, trees have been trimmed as a tigress with 3 four-month-old cubs could have met with an accident, three days ago on Katwal road.

Deputy director (buffer) G Guruprasad clarified, “A tigress with cubs is regularly crossing the said road near Katwal, and vehicles move at a breakneck speed. As there are no speed breakers between Mudholi-Katwal, there are chances of accident.”

Guruprasad added, “The road patch belongs to PWD and is too dense; the visibility of vehicles coming from two directions is almost nil. Hence, for precaution, we thought of clearing 3 metres on either side of the road to increase visibility.”

“Nearly 20-30 palash trees were chopped, besides removing lantana and bushes. The area is revenue land adjoining the core. The cleaning of vegetation will also act as a fire line during summer,” said Guruprasad.

However, wildlife experts and local NGOs have flayed TATR’s action. “When the park is generating revenue from PWD roads by way of implementing night safari, why can’t it invest on speed breakers on the said road?” they asked.

“Instead of chopping trees, the forest officials should keep a monitoring team at the spot. Tigers with cubs moving out of Tadoba to the nearby hills and forest in buffer is a temporary phase. Instead of chopping trees, a barrier should be installed to check traffic,” they said.

Chandrapur-based Deepak Dixit of Prakruti Foundation said, “Ideally, vehicular traffic should be banned during night on the road from Sitarampeth to Mudholi and further. However, the park management is more interested in night safari, so how can tiger conservation be achieved. Last month, a leopard was knocked dead by speeding vehicle in the same area.”

Dixit alleged, “The decision to chop trees shows that everything is to control animal movement, and steps to control humans who have free run on the said patch are not stringent. Many guests at the resorts near Mohurli venture during night on these road stretches for sightings.”

Guruprasad said that the department would write to PWD to install speed breakers at every 500 metres to avoid animal deaths.

Bengaluru: In a huge relief for Karnataka and in a perfect birthday gift to chief minister BS Yediyurappa, the Centre on Thursday issued a gazette notification for the implementation of the Mahadayi water dispute tribunal’s August 2018 verdict. The move comes after a nudge from the Supreme Court, which, on February 20, ordered the Centre to issue the notification.

“We are happy the Centre has notified the tribunal's verdict. With this, the long pending Kalasa-Banduri project will be a reality. We thank PM Narendra Modi and Union water resources minister Gajendra Singh Shekhawat for responding to our request with such a speed,” said Union parliamentary affairs minister Pralhad Joshi.

Karnataka ministers Ramesh Jarkiholi, Jagdish Shettar, Basavaraj Bommai and Joshi had met Shekhawat on Wednesday in Delhi to press for early notification of the tribunal’s verdict. Shettar said the government will take necessary steps to implement the Kalasa -Banduri projects at the earliest while expressing happiness over the notification.

419,['28/02/2020'],Used IV fluid bottles from GRH dumped nearby due to lack of bins,"This story is from February 28, 2020

Madurai: The lack of proper disposal method for used-up IV fluid and saline bottle at the Government Rajaji Hospital (GRH), is resulting in them being unceremoniously dumped in a compound near the hospital’s sewage pumping station. As contractors don’t turn up regularly to collect them, they pile up and get mixed with other wastes.

“Sometimes, contractors turn up after 15 days or more. So, the bottles tend to get piled up and gather dust. Sanitary workers also dump other wastes they sweep up like fallen leaves and plastic covers over the bottles. Since the corporation dust bins are located towards the other end of the hospital near the mortuary, workers sometimes lazily dump the waste here instead of carrying it there,” said a hospital source.

“The bottles are not hazardous waste, so there is no issue of it causing harm. As of now, we lack a proper space to store them properly before they are collected periodically. The particular compound is vacant and unused so they are being kept there. It is also easier to transport them outside the hospital from there since it is an open area,” said GRH dean Dr Sangumani J. The dean added that, if possible, they will make arrangements in future to shift and store them properly.

GRH, which has a bed strength over 2,000, generates hundreds of used-up IV fluid bags and saline bottles every day. However, contractors who are supposed to collect them come only after the waste piles up to a certain amount, which is at least a week. The bottles often pile up randomly across the entire stretch of the compound wall.

Sources added that workers find the particular spot convenient because it is right opposite to the surgical supply store. Hospital staff pointed out that bottles are not considered medical or pharmaceutical waste, so it is enough to simply store them in regular dust bins.

NEW DELHI: Delhi environment minister Gopal Rai on Thursday said the AAP government might consider preparing a three-level action plan to reduce air pollution in the city.

Track the pollution level in your city

“As experts suggested, action plan needs to be prepared for all 40 air quality monitoring stations in the city, that, too, from March to March, all year round. There will also be a special plan for winter, when the cold weather aggravates the situation. And also, a five-year one regarding what we can achieve in that time,” Rai said, while talking about various suggestions by experts and stakeholders given during a meeting at Delhi Secretariat on Thursday.

The minister said, experts suggested that a construction awareness campaign be held asking residents to plan and finish outdoor construction activities by October. “After that only indoor construction work could be allowed. If this could be done, then there may not be a need to ban constructions,” Rai said.

The experts also suggested that there should be an inter-state action committee to take steps to curb pollution due to biomass burning. “All the suggestions from Thursday’s conference would be sent to chief minister Arvind Kejriwal next week and a final action plan would be prepared after that,” Rai said.

Other suggestions included bigger environment budget and people’s charter with 20 points, through which residents could contribute to curbing pollution.

Experts from IIT Kanpur, Teri, IIT Delhi, University of Washington, among others, were present at the meeting along with officials of the civic bodies, PWD, Delhi Cantonment Board, transport department, DSIIDC, and DJB.

HYDERABAD: A Bangladeshi national travelling on an Indian passport obtained illegally by submitting Aadhaar , voter ID and PAN cards was apprehended by immigration authorities at the city airport early on Thursday.

A top Telangana police officer told TOI that the Bangladesh national, Mohammed Jalal Haque, had obtained the Indian passport by showing Warasiguda, in Secunderabad, as his permanent address in 2014. They said he had been on the police radar for some time along with a few others.

Acting on a tip-off, Mohammed Jalal was held by immigration authorities when he landed from Sharjah. During questioning he said he had married a Hyderabadi woman several years ago; he said he had met her when he was working in one of the Gulf countries .

The Telangana police have seized the illegally obtained documents Jalal used to get the Indian passport to travel to Saudi Arabia for work. Jalal travels in and out of India on his Indian passport to meet family members.

“How he could manage to get hold of the sensitive Aadhaar, voter ID and PAN cards needs to be investigated. He had been to Saudi Arabia on several occasions and worked as a driver there,’’ a source told TOI.

Jalal is still being questioned by intelligence officials.

“Since his wife and children are in Hyderabad, Jalal illegally moved to India. He was booked under the Indian Passport Act and relevant sections of the IPC. He might be declared arrested on Friday and produced before the concerned court,” the official said.

State intelligence officials have over the past one year caught at least two Bangladeshi nationals residing illegally in India and say they have dozens of foreign nationals on their radar for sneaking into Telangana using fake or illegally obtained documents.

Mandya: Minister KC Narayanagowda stirred a row after allegedly praising Maharashtra and Marathi in a programme held in KR Pete a week. A video of the alleged incident surfaced on Thursday and was widely shared on social media.

In the video, Narayanagowda allegedly boasts of his growth as an hotelier and realtor in Maharashtra and attributes all his good fortune to the neighbouring state.

“Maharashtra is my strength,” Narayanagowda purportedly says. “Whatever I’ve achieved in my life as hotelier, realtor and now as a minister, Maharashtra is the reason for that. If I have strength and power, then it belongs to Maharashtra only. I have no qualms in praising Maharashtra and Shivaji.”

Narayanagowda’s purported comments have, obviously, not gone down well with pro-Kannada activists, who held a protest in Mandya on Thursday. Various organisations also demanded an apology from Narayanagowda and sought his resignation.

Karnataka Raskhana Vedike (KRV) activists, who held a protest at Sri Nalvadi Circle on the Mysuru-Bengaluru highway, raised slogans against Narayanagowda and dubbed him a Marathi.

“How can he continue as a minister in Karnataka when he has openly declared allegiance to Maharashtra? Whose side is he on with regard to the border dispute with Maharashtra?” asked protesters.

Protesters warned of a fierce agitation if chief minister BS Yediyurappa did not remove Narayanagowda immediately from his cabinet.

Even the Delhi police appear to be hand-in-glove with the attackers. These attacks targeting Muslims are highly condemnable,” he said. He also condemned the Prime Minister Narendra Modi for not

meeting the victims and showing little concern. The protesters raised slogans and held banners against inaction by the Delhi police and sought the resignation of home Minister Amit Shah.

Meanwhile, anti-CAA, NRC, and NPR protests entered the 14th day at Jinnathidal in Mahboopalayam. Police personnel were deployed at both venues.

Representative image

CHENNAI: Be it to seek transfers or appointments or bid for contracts or redress grievances, the footfalls in the corridors of power are admittedly huge every day. With complaints aplenty about the gullible falling prey to conmen and women, the state government has ordered its staff across Tamil Nadu to wear photo identity cards or face disciplinary action.

An order issued by the personnel and administrative reforms department reiterated an earlier order. Heads of departments and district collectors will instruct staff to wear ID cards without fail. “Not wearing photo IDs may be viewed seriously, and disciplinary action may be initiated against erring individuals,” said an official directive. It also stems from the fact that half the government workforce, including those in the secretariat, move around without ID cards.

In a suo motu writ petition, the Madras high court in July 2018 directed the state to ensure that the rule on ID cards be strictly enforced and action be taken against violators. The government issued an order a month later reiterating the instructions, but complaints continue to pour in. As early as March 1986, the state government issued its first order that staff of public sector undertakings and local bodies, especially those who deal with public, should wear name badges.

All 575 sub-registrar offices come under CCTV surveillance but not many officials sport IDs. “There is no denying that offences take place. There are incidents where public with complaints have clear physical descriptions but don’t know the name of the staff. It is impossible to act,” said a senior officer, seeking anonymity. The bidders of government contracts or partymen and women, who frequent the government offices, enjoy clout in the administration. First-time visitors or the elderly are easy prey.

Unlike the commissionerate of police in Vepery that hands out colour-coded cards for visitors, a majority of the government offices, including Ezhilagam in Chepauk or Panagal Maligai in Saidapet, have visitors’ books. Digital ID cards and swipe card machines for both staff and visitors could make access to government offices more effective, say law enforcers.

Dehradun: Union law minister Ravi Shankar Prasad, on Thursday, inaugurated the circuit bench of the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal (ITAT) in the city. The facility would start functioning from Friday. He said that the ITAT would help state residents by saving them the trouble to travel all the way to Delhi for income tax litigation.

During the launch, he was asked about the allegation made by the Opposition parties that Justice S Muralidhar has been transferred because he pulled up Delhi police for its sloppy response during the violence that ensued in north-east Delhi a few days back. To this, he said, “The transfer order was in accordance with the recommendation made on February 12 by the Supreme Court collegium headed by Chief Justice of India. Before making the formal announcement, the consent of three judges was taken.”

The law minister attacked the Congress for questioning the transfer order saying, “Congress is hell-bent on destroying all institutions like CAG, courts, CBI, and CVC. Everyone knows what the Congress did during Emergency and how it muzzled all democratic rights.”

When asked about the CAA, Prasad said, “There is no question of stepping back on the law. The CAA does not threaten citizenship rights of the Muslims of the country. Although we are open to listening to any objections that the people have on this law.”

Meanwhile, the Union minister also launched WiFi facility at Dehradun ’s Jolly Grant Airport on the day.

Kapil Mishra paying tribute to Martyrs Ankit Sharma and Rattan Lal

NEW DELHI: BJP leader Kapil Mishra , whose speech on Sunday allegedly played a role in inciting mobs in northeast Delhi, took part in a silent peace march organised at Jantar Mantar on Thursday to pay tribute to Ratan Lal , the Delhi Police head constable , and Ankit Sharma , an Intelligence Bureau staffer , both of whom died during the riots.

The former MLA alleged, “No question is being asked to people who are talking about dividing the country or those on whose terrace petrol bombs were found. Someone who only requested for a road to be cleared to help 35 lakh people is being called a terrorist.”

Claiming that there was nothing inciting in his statement, he said, “I was just talking to a police officer. I don’t want to comment on a sub judice matter.”

On Sunday, Mishra led a gathering in support of the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) at Maujpur Chowk in Jafrabad, and issued an ultimatum to police to vacate the roads in Jafrabad and Bhajanpura in three days, following which violence erupted between pro- and anti-CAA groups.

The march, under the banner of Youth Against Jihadi Violence, ended at Parliament Street police station with the national anthem. Around 200 people took part in the two-hour event.

The organisers urged participants not to shout any slogan at the peace march. “However, we are calm, not weak,” one of them said. Ankita, a DU second-year student, said they had come to “show how you can protest peacefully in a democracy”. Seshmanee Sahu, a JNU research scholar, said the common man, irrespective of religion, was suffering and that needed to stop.

431,['28/02/2020'],Delhi Riots Latest News: Marauding mobs vent fury on schools too,"This story is from February 28, 2020

DRP School

NEW DELHI: There were at least 300 students in Victoria Senior Secondary School near Chand Bagh when it came under attack on Monday around 12.30pm. The school is a CBSE examination centre, and the students were writing their Class XII exam when a hundred-strong crowd gathered outside, pelted stones and charged at the gate, lathis in hand.

“We managed to secure the main gates and our boundaries, but we had no way of sending the students home because they were candidates from other schools. It was only around 6pm that their parents arrived and they left from the back door,” said caretaker Parveen Sharma. Principal Nawaz Farooq Ahmad ensured everyone exited the premises safely before closing the school indefinitely.

When TOI visited the school on Thursday, the building was eerily silent. The windows were shattered, there was a burnt bus outside, its scorched skeleton an indication of the mob frenzy. Two cars stood charred within the school premises. Ironically, the last news update on the bulletin board read, “Pro- and anti-CAA protesters clash in northeast Delhi.”

The aftermath of the riots will most impact the students — who have no institutions to return to. Nearby, Arun Modern Public School, which shares it walls with a mosque that was burnt down, resembled a battleground. Its yellow walls were covered in soot, the air was thick with smoke and some parts of the building were still afire. A group of workers was demolishing a wall that had been declared unsafe.

According to school owner Brahm Kumar Sharma, “hundreds of people” came and burnt down the building around 5pm. “They vandalised the school and stole computers, water motors, bathroom fittings, everything. We estimate the damage at Rs 2-3 crore,” he despaired.

Cashier Neetu Chowdhury alleged that no help arrived till 9pm. “Police did not stop the horde and the fire tenders took five hours to get here,” she said. But her concern was more about the future of the students. “The school had 1,800 students. Where will they study during the time we will take to rebuild?” she asked, showing TOI a few admit cards of students who were slated to appear for their Class X board exams. “We urgently applied for duplicate admit cards for students who had not collected their papers,” she added.

Neeraj, a Class X student, was at his blackened school on Thursday. “I don’t know where I will study now,” the youngster said.

A student from the madrassa attached to the mosque had a similar story. Mohammad Anas, 11, recounted, “We were praying inside when we heard the mob. Our mufti hid us inside a room. Thankfully the rioters were unable to break down the gates.” He said local residents rescued them and took them home.

Further down the lanes, the damage was more severe. Two adjacent schools on the Shiv Vihar-Karawal Nagar stretch — Rajdhani Senior Secondary and DRP —faced the fury of arsonists on Tuesday. While nearly 1,000 students studied in the former, there were 400 in the latter. Their walls had caved in, and there was ashen remains of what once were desks, chairs and blackboards.

Manoj Kalouni, caretaker of Rajdhani School for 18 years, his wife Sangeeta and their two children lived in a room on the premises. “After noon, parents began taking the students away because of rioters on the road. By 1pm, all the students and staff had left. But some 500 people forced their way in around 4pm and went on a rampage. We managed to stay hidden on the terrace and then fled to a school nearby to save our lives,” said Kalouni. The family plans to return to their home state of Uttarakhand for good.

Kalouni’s friend, who works in the other school, provided him shelter for nearly 60 hours, though there was no food. “The children were hungry but we couldn’t do anything. Security forces finally came to our rescue,” said Kalouni, who lost all his belongings. He doesn’t even have money to return to his village. His only hope is school principal Faisal Farooque. “I hope he gives me some money so I can leave Delhi,” the shaken man said.

As students and staff await the return to classrooms, a hand-made poster on one of the school walls relayed an important message. “Education is the ability to listen to everything without losing your temper or self-confidence,” it says. Pity such messages are lost when the students reach adulthood.

Panaji: The state government on Thursday constituted a selection committee besides a monitoring committee to oversee the utilisation of the Dongeri Tal-II coal block in Madhya Pradesh.

The two committees include members of local industry bodies. The selection committee, which is headed by the secretary of industries Nila Mohanan, will choose the consultant, which will assist Goa Industrial Development Corporation (GIDC) in efficient exploitation of the coal block.

Under-secretary A S Mahatme said the selection committee will devise a standard procedure for selection of the consultant based on their technical qualification and financial offers.

The five-member committee also comprises additional finance secretary, under-secretary for industries, director of industries, trade & commerce department and managing director for GIDC.

In the notification, Mahatme also said the government has constituted a monitoring committee to oversee the development the coal block allotted to GIDC. The committee is headed by industries minister Vishwajit Rane and includes chairman of GIDC Glen nTiclo.

Mohanan along with president of Goa State Industries Association Damodar Kochar, president of Goa Chamber of Commerce and Industry Manoj Caculo and a few others are also on the nine-member committee.

The monitoring committee will frame the broad guidelines on how the coal block is utilised by GIDC, said government sources. Goa is running out of time to complete the formalities for utilization of the coal block and Coal India limited (CIL) has already served an ultimatum to GIDC.

Pon Radhakrishnan

CHENNAI: Former BJP state president Pon Radhakrishnan on Thursday said Prime Minister Narendra Modi was “soft” in handling the Delhi protests , which spiralled out of control on Sunday evening and continued for two days, claiming 27 lives.

“It ( Delhi violence ) should have been handled with an iron hand but he did not do it. It should be done if such a situation arises. But the PM has approached the issue carefully and cautiously and handled it softly,” said the former Union minister, reacting to actor Rajinikanth’s statement that failure of intelligence led to the violence and that it should have been “put down with an iron hand”.

Indirectly hitting out at the actor, Radhakrishnan said, “People should not deliver cinematic dialogues without understanding the problem and the issues in Delhi”. He, however, admitted that there was intelligence failure and failure on the part of the Centre following which several officers have been shunted out.

Several parts of the country are inaccessible to law enforcing agencies due to entry restrictions, said Radhakrishnan. “Muslim community elders have also expressed concern over such issues on several occasions. This resulted in such incidents (the Delhi violence),” he said, adding that the Tamil Nadu and other state governments should ensure that their states were accessible, particularly for police and other agencies,” he said.

The former minister said no more opportunity should be given for creation of another Pakistan. “If it happens, it will be disastrous,” he said. “Whoever it may be, action should be taken. There is no difference between pro and anti-CAA protesters. The Modi government will take appropriate action against them,” he said, responding to questions on BJP leaders and ministers making provocative statements.

Responding to S Ramadoss tweets urging the TN government to pass resolution against NRC, he cautioned political parties against falling prey to “divisive politics” of the DMK and its allies.

Kolkata: Maharatna Oil PSU Indian Oil is investing Rs 6,690 crore in West Bengal that includes its Rs 3,000crore funding in Haldia Refinery for making it BS VI-compliant. IOC executive director Pritish Bharat pointed out that besides BS VI, it is investing in pipelines, modernisation of retail outlets along with others. The PSU oil-marketing company is investing Rs 341 crore in Paradip-Somnathpur-Haldia pipeline project and another Rs 1,199 crore for augmentation of Paradip-Haldia-Durgapur pipeline.

All the pipeline projects are likely to be completed by October 21, though some projects would be operational before that, the IOC ED said.

Earlier, Bharat said that it has already started supplying BS VI-compliant products to retail outlets so that it can gradually mix with BS IV and by April 1, the entire fleet of 1,233 retail outlets of IOC in the state is refilled with BS VI. According to him, 26 new retail outlets and 43 rural outlets will be commissioned this year in West Bengal.

Elaborating future plans, he added that around 300 retail outlets will be coming up in West Bengal, Sikkim and Andaman in the next one-two years. “As on January 2020, 21.3% of overall transactions at retail outlets are digital transactions in the state,” he added.

Besides BS-VI and pipeline, IOC has also embarked on green fuel initiative in the state by converting waste into bio gas. “We have taken up compressed bio gas project where biodegradable waste will be compressed into methane gas which later will be refined further to CNG. IOC has tied up with Dharti Energy and Divya Auto for this. We shall have a buy-back arrangement with them. Our company has already set up a pilot project for this in Tamil Nadu,” he added.

According to him, it would supply CNG initially to two-three retail outlets from these projects. The JV of IOC and Adani, IndianOil-Adani Gas, has won the city gas distribution rights for East and West Burdwan. IOC on its own has also applied for city gas distributions rights for 11 districts in Bengal.

Police patrolling in northeast Delhi after communal riots on February 27

Nearly 7,000 central paramilitary forces were deployed in the affected areas of northeast district since February 24.

NEW DELHI: Till Tuesday afternoon, there were no signs that the violence in northeast Delhi would come to an end any time soon. Police had evidently failed in stopping the rioters from wreaking havoc and the morale of the force seemed to have hit rock bottom with severe criticism coming from all sides. However, Delhi Police bounced back and regained control of the law and order situation in less than 24 hours.While National Security Advisor Ajit Doval was tasked to ensure that peace returns to the region, special DG (CRPF) SN Shrivastava was given the order to join as the law and order chief immediately. The fresh guard remained on the ground for over 20 hours to fulfil the purpose.The first step was a coordinated and adequate deployment. Three special commissioners, six joint commissioners, an additional commissioner, 22 DCPs, 20 ACPs, 60 inspectors, 1,200 male and 200 women personnel and 60 companies of outside forces were stationed at crucial locations. Union home minister Amit Shah reviewed the situation every two hours.Delhi violence: Live updatesIn the intervening night of Tuesday and Wednesday, the changed attitude of police was clearly visible. The policemen were proactive in dispersing fresh gatherings, which were being attempted by different groups claiming to be protesting against Citizenship Amendment Act.One such group assembled at Khureji and refused to budge on Wednesday noon, but police were quick to use force and move them away. Six of the organisers, including Khalid and Ishrat Jahan, were arrested for allegedly mobilising the crowd and blocking the road.Nearly 7,000 central paramilitary forces were deployed in the affected areas of Northeast district since February 24. As violence stopped, police on Wednesday started holding peace committee meetings to normalise the situation and improve inter-community harmony. In the last two days, nearly 330 such meetings were organised in various districts and they would continue till the situation normalises.East Delhi Municipal Corporation initiated steps to clean the streets and repair damaged public properties in riot-affected areas. Two helplines — 22829334 and 22829335 — were set up for round-the-clock assistance.“Apart from this, meetings with residents’ welfare associations and market welfare associations were also convened in several areas. They were attended by different sections of the society, including civil society groups and representatives of Congress, BJP, AAP and other political parties,” an MHA official said.The home ministry has requested citizens to not lay credence to any rumour. Shah appealed to citizens not to “fall prey to evil designs of miscreants and groups interested in precipitating communal tension”.“Only 12 police stations out of 203 in Delhi (about 4.2% of the geographical area) have been affected by the riots. Normalcy and communal harmony has prevailed elsewhere in the capital.

In a video, rioters were seen allegedly on the terrace of the councillor's house

NEW DELHI: In the maze of the Chand Bagh neighbourhood, a four-storey building belonging to AAP councillor Tahir Hussain stands out — it’s the tallest structure there. In the past three days, however, it has also become the most talked about since the family of the IB official, Ankit Sharma, whose body was found in a drain, has alleged Hussain’s hand in his death. Several locals have alleged that rioters had used it to carry out attacks in the communal violence that rocked north-east Delhi. A video showing several hundred people throwing stones and petrol bombs from atop the building had gone viral on social media.

When TOI visited the site on Thursday, cops were stationed outside the building but journalists were being let in. While several locals confirmed that the building belonged to Hussain, they said it wasn’t his residence. His house, in fact, is situated just behind the building.

Hussain, 43, represents Nehru Vihar (Ward No 59) under the east corporation. He was elected in 2017 and, according to his affidavit, he does not have any criminal cases against him. He belongs to UP but has been living in Delhi for over 25 years and has a business of interior designing.

On the terrace, one spotted a stockpile of petrol bombs and sharp pieces of stones kept in sacks that could have inflicted serious damage if dropped on people from that height. There were at least three crates, two of them empty, while one had petrol bombs made from cold drink bottles. Piles of rubble with pieces of bricks and cement were scattered on the terrace.

The building was completely bare and either served as a warehouse or a manufacturing unit once. The first floor of the building was labelled “production area”. A room with paint cans was labelled “paint booth”. A small store room with spare computer parts seemed to have been vandalised. The second floor seemed to be under construction without any furniture or fixture and the third floor, too, looked similar.

From the terrace, it was clear that the two buildings adjacent to it were completely charred. These seemed to be shops which were burnt beyond recognition and it was unclear what they had sold when they functioned. The roof of the shop on the right had caved in, probably because of a fire. TOI could not enter these shops because the shutters were down.

Locals TOI spoke to gave contradictory statements. Members of one community alleged that the attack from Hussain’s building was “pre-planned” and the ammunition had been stored there before the riots broke. “We have recorded everything. He sheltered the people who instigated the violence and killed Ankit Sharma,” alleged one of them.

Members from the other community, however, backed Hussain. They did concede that the house was used by a mob but the people came from outside, they said. “Hussain had to be rescued from his house because his house was under attack. It was then that a mob captured his house and used it to wreak havoc in the area,” said a man.

“Based on directions of the Goa Lokayukta, conducting re-enquiry by ACB Panaji into the allegations on the award of beach cleaning tender by department of tourism, government of Goa is in progress,” director of tourism Menino D’ Souza said in the rejoined filed before the Lokayukta.

When contacted, a senior ACB officer said that they have not initiated any inquiry in the alleged beach cleaning scam yet but if they receive the file they will conduct one.

Social activist Inacio Domnic Pereira had filed a complaint before the Lokaykta with regards to the beach cleaning.

On December 2, 2017, the state government had accepted the Goa Lokayukta’s recommendation in the alleged scam to reopen the investigation through ACB. Earlier, the Lokayukta had found former tourism minister Dilip Parulekar guilty in the scam. The ACB had investigated and closed the case.

Amit Shah

BHUBANESWAR: All eyes will be trained on Amit Shah ’s visit here on Friday when he will first chair an Eastern Zonal Council meeting and then address a pro-CAA rally.

Shah’s rally — his first since the death of at least 34 people in New Delhi over CAA earlier this week — is likely to draw more than a lakh BJP supporters. This will also be Shah’s first visit to Odisha as home minister.

The state BJP, which got a new president in Samir Mohanty last month, said the rally was part of the saffron party’s all-India campaign to combat ‘misinformation’ on CAA. “There is great enthusiasm among the people for CAA in spite of efforts by Congress to mislead the citizens. More than one lakh people will attend the programme,” Mohanty said.

What Shah chooses to say about CAA would be keenly watched given the tense situation in the national capital, BJP insiders said. They also said all party office-bearers, MPs and MLAs in the coastal districts of Odisha had been asked to ensure an impressive turnout at Shah’s rally.

Booth-level workers from across the state have been asked to attend the rally at Janata Maidan, which will also be addressed by Union ministers Dharmendra Pradhan and Pratap Sarangi. Roads leading to the site have been decorated with banners and posters publicising the event. Vans fitted with loudspeakers, too, have been deployed in and around Bhubaneswar to ensure a good turnout.

The unrest over the contentious citizenship act may also cast a shadow on the zonal council meeting, which will be attended by a chief minister who have vocally opposed CAA (Mamata Banerjee) and two who have supported it in Parliament (Nitish Kumar and Naveen Patnaik). Jharkhand chief minister Hemant Soren will not be attending the meeting.

The BJD and Congress have both termed Shah’s rally as ‘unnecessary’ and ‘ill-timed’. “There is no need for awareness on CAA in Odisha. The BJP should have reached out to people across the country before enacting CAA. It would have been better if the Centre had created public awareness before implementing it. I don’t see what the rally will achieve,” BJD spokesperson and MLA Pratap Keshari Deb said.

Senior Congress leader and MLA Suresh Chandra Rourtay added, “The rally is a farce and a waste of public money. What will Shah explain when Delhi is burning?”

On Saturday, the second day of his two-day visit to the state, Shah is scheduled to offer prayers at the Jagannath Temple in Puri and the Lingaraj Temple here.

439,['28/02/2020'],Dismissal from service: PSI Gudlar gets 15 days to reply,"This story is from February 28, 2020

Panaji: Goa police issued a memorandum to police sub-inspector Sunil Gudlar asking him why he should not be dismissed from service due to his official misconduct. Gudlar was arrested in 2011 in the police-politician-drug mafia nexus case.

He was later released on bail.

Currently, Gudlar, who is attached to Goa Reserve Police, Altinho, Panaji, and is temporarily deputed to special branch at police headquarters, Panaji.

Police conducted a departmental enquiry (DE) against Gudlar and the report “partially proved” his official misconduct, a senior police officer said.

“On a careful consideration of the report, I don’t agree with the findings of the report due to the reasons indicated in the disagreement note. I propose to dismiss PSI Sunil Gudlar from service,” deputy inspector general of police (DIG) Rajesh Kumar said.

Gudlar can make a representation about the proposed penalty within 15 days, he said. “Any representation he makes will be considered,” Kumar said.

After submitting his written reply, Gudlar can also meet me and present his defence with documents to support his statements, the DIG said.

“If he does not use this opportunity of personal hearing, I will proceed to decide on the case based on his written reply and other evidence in the enquiry files,” Kumar said.

Earlier, CBI had arrested Gudlar after he was suspended by Goa police in the nexus case. Gudlar, earlier posted with ANC as PSI, came under the spotlight after the arrest of alleged Israeli drug dealer David Driham alias Dudu.

Thereafter, the former ANC PSI was caught in a spy-camera video clipping allegedly selling drugs, demanding a bribe from Dudu’s sister and girlfriend, and threatening to plant charas on person if he failed to pay the amount.

Dudu’s sister Ayala later said she conducted the sting operation to unravel the police-drug mafia nexus after her brother’s arrest for dealing in drugs in Goa in 2009. CBI had filed the chargesheet in the case.

Kolkata: Coal India ( CIL ) has liquidated over 82% of its arrears rakes to non-power sector consumers during the ongoing fiscal. These backlog rakes pertain to 2017-18 and 2018-19.

According to officials, muted demand for the dry fuel from the thermal power stations and comfortable stock position at their end provided a window for the Maharatna coal mining behemoth to bring down the accumulated arrear rakes of the non-power sector consumers.

The backlog arrears for this sector which stood close to 5,140 rakes at the beginning of 2019-20 were cleared by 4230 rakes. “By the end of FY 20, we will be able to clear the rest 900-odd arrear rakes,” stated an official of the company. CIL’s supplies to non-power sector registered a growth of 4.4% at 95.45 million tonnes (MTs) during April-January 2020 compared to 91.47 MTs same period year ago.

The combined coal stock at CIL’s own pitheads and at coal linkage based thermal power plants of the country stands at a comfortable 78.25 MTs. Coal stock at power plants increased to a decade high of 36.36 mts (as of February 24), an average 20 day stock, just two days short of CEA mandated 22-day stock.

NEW DELHI: “When we heard the mob attacking the houses nearby, we hid the men in our family under clothes and inside a cupboard. But the rioters barged in and dragged my brother out though he kept pleading, ‘Main aapka bhai hoon’. After two days of searching for him, we finally came to Guru Teg Bahadur Hospital where we located his body,” wept Farheen, sister of Mohammed Musharraf.Farheen’s household is tragically fortunate to have found Chand Bagh resident Musharraf’s body on Thursday morning. There are many families that are still to locate loved ones missing since violence broke out in northeast Delhi on Sunday and for them there is no sense of closure yet. As more bodies are being found in the smouldering debris of the communal frenzy, the toll climbed to 38 on Thursday.Between big sobs, Farheen narrated, “We were actually preparing to leave the area at the first opportune time, but even as we prepared to go, a mob attacked our neighbourhood. Ours was among the first houses to be attacked. Hindu families occupied the first two floors and the horde skipped them while rushing to our second floor house. I had hidden my husband under a pile of clothes and my brother inside a cupboard. My husband had a miraculous escape, but my brother was discovered, dragged out and beaten in the road before being pushed into a car and taken away. We cried for help but it was all futile.”When the situation calmed down a bit, the family ventured out to trace the 35-year-old Musharraf. “We went to many places. Then an acquaintance of Musharraf informed us of hearing that he had been thrown into the Chand Bagh drain. We went there but didn’t find anything. Today morning, we came to GTB Hospital and finally found him — dead,” Farheen said.Waris Ali Khan had also been searching for his nephew, Mohseen, 24, since Tuesday. “Mohseen owns a generator shop in Noida. Around 5pm that day, he had returned home to Bhajanpura, where he also had to meet someone for a work-related appointment,” Khan said. “Near the temple, a mob surrounded his car and heckled him. He managed to call a friend who was on speed dial on his phone, but before anyone could rush to his aid, the rabble thrashed him and threw him into a drain. His body must have been fished out and brought to GTB Hospital.”Rajiv Saini, a resident of Brahmpuri, was lying on the floor at the hospital awaiting news of the condition of his brother, Naresh, 32. “He is lying in the ICU for the last three days. He was shot in the chest outside our house. He has a five-year-old daughter and a three-year-old son,” Saini mumbled.Waiting for the post-mortem of his sibling to be carried out, Muzammil Khan described Tuesday as the worst day of their life for the family. “We live in Kabir Nagar,” Muzammil said. “When things quietened down after the violence, my brother Mudassir went out to buy food. He never returned. He was shot in his head. His wife and six daughters are left without a bread winner.”GTB hospital director Dr Sunil Kumar said 215 riot victims had been treated there since Monday. “However, at the moment, only 51 patients are receiving treatment in the various departments. The rest have been discharged,” he said. Dr Kumar added that only one of the admitted patients is in a critical state. “In all, we have confirmed 33 deaths. Of these, 22 were already dead when brought to the hospital, while nine died after admission,” the hospital director said.Also at the hospital were those recovering from the murderous attacks. Ashfaq, one of them, said, “I was hit by a rod when trying to save my brother from the mob. Thank God, I am not dead like so many others in my neighbourhood.

PANAJI: The once permanently frozen parts of our planet are changing, prompting scientists to try and understand the mechanism behind those changes. Canadian geologist David Scott, who is currently in Goa to collaborate with the National Centre for Polar and Ocean Research (NCPOR), Vasco, said it is becoming increasingly important to study the topography of the world’s “third pole”, the Himalayas .

Scott is president and CEO of Polar Knowledge Canada, a federal agency aimed at strengthening Canadian leadership in polar science and technology. He said a study of the topography of the Himalayas, along with that of the North and South Poles, is crucial to better understand what future climate and weather conditions would look like.

The polar research expert explained that while Earth has only two poles in terms of environmental conditions, the Himalayas have glaciers and many of the same characteristics as both the polar regions.

“It’s an important component to study all of the cold regions on the planet – north, south and the middle where the glaciers of the Himalayas are suffering the same response to a warming climate. The reaction to those changes is also important,” Scott said.

Aspects like the quantity of ice being lost, the amount of water running off and the influence that these have on the changing climate need to be studied, he said, especially since they may be connected to the monsoon.

“The monsoon is changing, so there are implications on agriculture and food production. There are very important questions that can be answered by studying things in the Himalayas and the North and South Poles to fully understand how the global system is changing and predict what it might look like in the future,” he said.

Scott said some Canadian researchers who specialise in the study of glaciers may already be working in small ways in the Himalayas.

“But as NCPOR expands its capacity, there will be newer opportunities for others who could come and work with Indian scientists in that region,” he said, even as he clarified that Polar Knowledge Canada is not yet equipped to work on the glaciers.

Aurangabad: The issue of installation and maintenance of streetlights in the city, which has been dominating almost every general body meeting, continues to haunt most corporators even as their term nears completion.

Meanwhile, the civic administration has been failing to meet its deadlines on repair and maintenance of LED as well as old streetlights.

As many as 18 corporators from across parties had launched an attack on the civic administration for failing to take action against their complaints on dysfunctional streetlights . The corporators said that AMC official KD Deshmukh, who is in-charge of the electricity department, does not respond to their calls.

Members, including Manisha Munde, Salima Beghum Khajoddin, Kirti Shinde, Seema Chakranarayan and Jyoti Nade, said that every time the officer is asked about the non-functioning streetlights, he takes a note of the complaints and maintains that the issue will be resolved in eight to ten days; however, the issue does not get sorted on the ground. “It’s been five years but the issues have not been resolved,” Nade said.

BJP member Madhuri Adwant-Deshmukh raised the issue of illumination of VD Savarkar’s statue in the Samarth Nagar area. She said that the lights put up at the statue do not work, adding that several complaints about dysfunctional lights have been made to the administration, but in vain. Mayor Nandkumar Ghodele directed the electricity department to ensure that the lights are in working condition.

After KD Deshmukh failed to give convincing response to the complaints of the members, mayor asked deputy municipal commissioner Sumant More to call official AB Deshmukh of the municipal corporation and demand an explanation in this regard.

Incidentally, the AMC had given the contract of installing 40,000 LED streetlights in the city to a private agency. According to PR Bansode of the agency, 36,000 lights have already been installed. The work on installation of the remaining 4,000 streetlights is underway. He said that every month the agency takes in writing about any complaints related to streetlights from the corporators. “None of the lights installed so far are in poor condition or await repair. The complaints that come are only for old lights which are not included in our contract,” he said.

CLEARED SKHER

Aurangabad: Former allies, BJP and Shiv Sena corporators in Aurangabad , vied to take credit for the state government’s decision to give financial assistance for the construction of 23 roads in city. The state government recently approved Rs 152 crore for construction of the roads.

Three agencies are expected to carry out the work — Aurangabad Municipal Corporation (AMC), Maharahstra State Road Development Corporation (MSRDC) and Maharashtra Industrial Development Corporation (MIDC). The three agencies have issued issued tenders over the past couple of days for the construction of the 23 roads.

During the general body meeting on Thursday, Deputy mayor Rajendra Janjal of Shiv Sena brought a proposal to felicitate chief minister Uddhav Thackeray and his cabinet for approving the road project for the city. “This is the highest amount sanctioned by the state government for the road project in the city,” he said.

At that point, BJP corporators rebuffed the Sena members, saying that it was their party-led government that had given a nod for the project. BJP member Raju Shinde said the BJP government too had approved and provided funds for different road projects for the city.

At the same time, BJP’s Raj Wankhede expressed discontent over the road selection. He questioned the criteria on which the roads were selected. Soon after the list of roads, that are either to be concreted or tarred, was released objections were raised on the road selection.

Shinde asked the mayor why the entire amount was not approved. Mayor Nandkumar Ghodele said the AMC had prepared and sent a list of 103 roads with an estimated cost of Rs 462 crore for the concreting and tarring. “A panel comprising the chief minister and district guardian minister took a call on the selection of roads. However, this is only the first phase of the road project,” Ghodele said.

When Shinde asked whether another set of roads would be approved before the model code of conduct for civic elections comes into force, Ghodele said that it is possible that more roads could be approved during the ongoing session of the state assembly.

Bhubaneswar: The state government will enforce the amended Motor Vehicles (MV) Act strictly from March 1, six months after it was introduced. The government had refrained from enforcing the Act in letter and spirit for the past six months to give vehicle owners enough time to get their papers in order.

“We will start enforcement drive against traffic rule violators from March 1. On September 9, 2019, chief minister Naveen Patnaik had announced the first of the two three-month relaxations in the enforcement of the act. The second relaxation was announced in November last year, keeping in mind the huge rush at regional transport offices (RTO),” transport minister Padmanabh Behera said.

Transport commissioner Sanjeeb Panda said enforcement activities would be carried out by the RTOs and police. He also said people had been given enough time to apply for learners’ licence (LL), driving licence (DL) and pollution under control (PUC) certificates.

“We conducted a number of awareness campaigns among the people about the new Act. We urged them repeatedly to get their documents ready. Extra counters were opened at RTOs to handle the rush of applicants and facilitate smooth delivery of services. A record number of licences — 11,38,475 LLs and 3,66,609 DLs — were issued between September 2019 and February 2020. In 2018, only 3.5 lakh LLs and 2.3 DLs had been issued,” Panda said.

The transport department clarified that leniency was shown only to certain kinds of offences , in the past six months. “There was no leniency in addressing cases of drink driving, dangerous driving, overspeeding, driving against flow of traffic, using mobile while driving, triple riding on two-wheeler, overloading, jumping of red light, not wearing helmet and seat belt,” Panda said.

The transport department also said accident fatalities had come down by 12 per cent in September, 18.7 per cent in October, 6.6 per cent in November and 26.9 per cent in December last year in comparison to the figures for the corresponding periods in 2018.

Security personnel deployed at Chand Bagh after riots in northeast Delhi on February 27

NEW DELHI: Public health groups have issued a statement expressing concern over the manner in which access to healthcare , including emergency medical treatment to the injured, was not being provided in the context of communal violence in Delhi.

Jan Swasthya Abhiyan and Medico Friends Circle in a statement said the police must not be allowed to stop patients and ambulances carrying them, doctors and drugs and medical supplies to any health facility. “Delays in this regard are absolutely unacceptable and are a violation of the fundamental rights of all people. It can have serious consequences,” said the statement.

Public health activists said it was deplorable that a midnight intervention by Delhi high court was necessary to address the situation at Al Hind hospital in Mustafabad, which had been cordoned off by the police and ambulances, patients and medical supplies were not allowed to reach the hospital for several hours. They pointed out that the hospital was providing treatment to persons injured in the violence over the past two days.

“The right to life is paramount and absolute, and all the state agencies, including medical professionals and the police have a constitutional obligation to ensure the preservation of the right,” said the statement, adding that the right to health is a fundamental human right and the state of Delhi ought to refrain from interfering directly or indirectly with the enjoyment of this right.

The public health groups have demanded the police and the state to ensure medical personnel were not only not prevented, but also protected in fulfilling their duties in providing healthcare and saving lives.

453,['28/02/2020'],Jaipur: Underground metro corridor to be made operational after CMRS inspection,"This story is from February 28, 2020

The underground corridor is expected to be operational by March-end

JAIPUR: Jaipur Metro Rail Corporation ( JMRC ) is waiting for the Commissioner of Metro Rail Safety ( CMRS ) to conduct trials before throwing open the corridor to the public.

With the corporation having completed the civil work and is in the last lap of completing the remaining signalling work, a request has been sent to the CMRS to conduct the mandatory trials.

On Thursday, Congress chief whip Mahesh Joshi, MLA Ameen Kagzi along with the JMRC chairman-cum-managing director (CMD) Samit Sharma took stock of the project.

Sharma said, “Civil work of the project is completed and request has been forwarded to the CMRS to conduct trials. We have already conducted a few internal trials. During the inspection, the commissioner will check track parameters, tunnels and the stations, calibration of the trains and firefighting system among others,” he said.

It was informed that due to the coronavirus, installation of automated fare collection has been delayed as machines are imported from South Korea.

The underground corridor, which is expansion of Phase-I (Mansarovar to Chandpole), is expected to be operational by March 2020.

The length of entire Metro corridor Phase 1A and 1B is 12.07km. After BJP came to power, the then chief minister Vasundhara Raje inaugurated Jaipur Metro Rail Project (Phase 1A) in June 2015. This corridor was made operational in 2015 after spending Rs 2,023 crore.

“The project cost of underground Phase-IB project is Rs 1,126 crore. Out of which Rs 969 crore has been provided by the Asian Development Bank (ADB),” said a senior offical

Sources at JMRC said the Metro Phase 1B missed its June 2018 deadline due to various reasons including Supreme Court ban on sand mining, shifting of seven temples and design change of two underground stations. The JMRC officials believe there will be increase in ridership after the Phase 1B) is operational. In absence of Phase 1B, the performance of Phase-IA of Jaipur Metro was ‘poor’ as the average ridership dipped.

“At present, an average 20,000 passengers commute through Metro daily, as against the projected figure of one lakh. But Phase-II is expected to boost the numbers,” said a senior official.

454,['28/02/2020'],Kerala: Crime branch widens scope of missing cartridges probe,"This story is from February 28, 2020

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The crime branch has widened the inquiry into the missing cartridges of the state police as the probe team has decided to interrogate officials up to the rank of assistant commandant , who is responsible for accepting the cartridges from the police chief store.

The crime branch team has decided to interrogate the current assistant commandant and former assistant commandants of special armed police (SAP), as it was found that the cartridges went missing during the custodianship of seven inspectors. The crime branch team has recorded the statements of the officials of the police chief store from where the cartridges are distributed. The probe team also examined the records at the police chief store.

In the SAP, the crime branch team found that during 2012-13 alone, as many as 3,624 cartridges went missing. It is in this context that the crime branch team decided to interrogate all the assistant commandants of various periods in the last 22 years.

The crime branch team had, on Wednesday, arrested a sub-inspector of police who was the quarter master in the SAP after ascertaining the officer’s role in replacing the missing cartridges with forged ones. Crime branch sources said that though he was among the 11 lower ranking officers against whom the case was originally registered, his role was evident as he was found to have committed forgery. “The probe will go beyond these 11 lower ranking officers, as they are only immediately responsible for handling the cartridges. But the responsibility of maintaining the cartridges goes to the higher officers as well,” a top crime branch source said.

Meanwhile, a section of the officers is unhappy with the crime branch action of arresting a sub-inspector on criminal charges. “There is a section who feels that only departmental responsibility should have been fixed on the official and not criminal charges. But forging cartridges is not a matter to be reduced to a departmental inquiry alone, it is a criminal offence,” sources added.

457,['28/02/2020'],Plan to supply Harsul Lake’s water shelved,"This story is from February 28, 2020

Aurangabad: The Aurangabad Municipal Corporation’s (AMC) decision to supply water from Harsul Lake to around 16 wards near the Delhi Gate has hit a roadblock after several local corporators raised objections in Thursday’s general body meeting.

The corporators argued that the decision would exhaust water in the lake, causing water shortage to those residing in no-pipeline areas of the city.

According to AMC’s water works department, the capacity of existing water works scheme pumping water from Jayakwadi Dam has reduced to a dismal 135 million litres per day (MLD). The civic administration maintains that this water is not enough to meet the needs of the city. Subsequently, it supplies water to the residents once in six to seven days.

In the wake of limitations of water pumping infrastructure, the civic administration had decided to use Harsul Lake’s water instead of Jayakwadi water to quench the thirst of 15 to 16 wards near the Delhi Gate area. However, the move did not go well with corporators Bansilal Jadhav (Bhagatsingnagar), Rupchand Waghmare (Ekta Nagar), Jyoti Abhang (Chetna Nagar), Raj Wankhede (Wankhede Nagar) and Sitaram Sure (Surewadi), who objected to the decision.

Abhang said that the lake did not have enough water last year; however, this year, due to sufficient rainfall, the lake has water reserve. “Many areas around the lake have not been connected to the piped water supply network of the civic body. The residents in these areas depend on borewells to meet their water requirement. Water in the Harsul Lake ensures that the groundwater levels are recharged,” she said.

Rupchand Waghmare said that if lake from the water is distributed to the wards, the groundwater will get dried up.

When asked, executive engineer Kiran Dhande, who is heading the water works department, told the general body that lake can supply 95 MLD water until May. Sure said that the water supply will hardly last for 15 days to a month.

Considering the opposition of the members, the mayor issued a ruling that the plan to use Harsul Lake’s water for the said wards of the city be shelved.

NEW DELHI: The central government on Thursday strongly defended notification of Justice S Muralidhar’s transfer from Delhi high court to Punjab and Haryana high court, and criticised the opposition for “politicising” a routine transfer recommended by the Supreme Court collegium.“Transfer of Justice Muralidhar was done pursuant to the recommendation dated February 12 of the Supreme Court collegium headed by the Chief Justice of India. While transferring the judge, consent of the judge is taken. The well-settled process has been followed,” Union law minister Ravi Shankar Prasad said.“By politicising a routine transfer, Congress has yet again displayed its scant regard for the judiciary,” he added.The notification of Justice Muralidhar’s transfer to Punjab and Haryana high court came late on Wednesday evening, interestingly on a day when he had taken up the matter of communal riots in Delhi for adjudication and sharply pulled up Delhi Police for inaction and failure to register FIRs against politicians for hate speeches.Congress linked Justice Muralidhar’s transfer to his strictures against Delhi Police and alleged that it had exposed “intimidation and vendetta politics” of the BJP government. Congress’s Rahul Gandhi also invoked Mumbai judge B H Loya whose death while hearing the Sohrabuddin encounter case triggered a controversy.Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi tweeted, “The midnight transfer of Justice Muralidhar isn’t shocking given the current dispensation, but it is certainly sad and shameful.” Rahul tweeted, “Remembering the brave judge Loya, who wasn’t transferred.”Justice Muralidhar’s bench had pulled up Delhi Police over its failure to register FIRs for alleged hate speeches by BJP’s Anurag Thakur, Parvesh Verma and Kapil Mishra. It had expressed “anguish” and asked the police commissioner to take a “conscious decision” on it by Thursday observing “we do not want the city to witness another 1984 riots”.Justice Muralidhar, being the senior-most judge available on Tuesday night, had also conducted a late night hearing at his residence to ensure victims in a hospital in northeast Delhi got safe passage and treatment in better hospitals. He had asked the police to escort ambulances and ferry them to Delhi government hospitals.Along with Justice Muralidhar, the government also notified the transfer of two other high court judges recommended by the collegium — Justice Ranjit Vasantrao More from Bombay HC to Meghalaya HC and Justice Ravi Vijaykumar Malimath from Karnataka HC to Uttarakhand HC.The President also accepted the resignation of Justice Dharmadhikari of Bombay high court. He had resigned on February 15.

Kozhikode: Jolly Joseph , the accused in Koodathayi multiple murder case , attempted suicide inside Kozhikode district prison on Thursday morning. The woman is undergoing treatment at Kozhikode Medical College Hospital.

According to police, the prison authorities noticed the incident around 5am when Jolly attempted suicide by making a wound on her wrist.

Other prison inmates reported the incident to the jail authorities. Probe is on regarding the object she used to attempt suicide. The use of a sharp metallic object or broken glass piece is suspected.

According to medical college hospital authorities, Jolly was taken to KMCH around 5.30am with a bleeding hand. She had made a cut on her left wrist with some sharp object. The injury was not serious and a minor surgery was performed for treatment.

According to sources, the wound was caused using some sharp weapon. However, prison authorities claimed that they could not recover any blade, knife or other sharp instruments from the prison cell. They also raised suspicion that Jolly might have caused the wound using her teeth.

Following the incident, police conducted a search inside the prison cell. Security has also been stepped up at the hospital.

Deputy inspector general of prisons M K Vinod Kumar visited the jail and conducted a preliminary investigation into the incident.

Jolly had shown suicidal tendencies during her police custody period too. The police team had recorded Jolly’s arrest a day before the proposed date as they suspected that she would attempt suicide.

Jolly is accused of murdering her ex-husband, parents-in laws and three others including a two-year-old child.

Jaipur: The Bundi bus tragedy that claimed 24 lives on Wednesday should be a warning for civic authorities in the city where many bridges over nullahs do not have safety railings .

The nullah on Dravyavati River towards Durgapura to Maharani Farm and from Gujjar ki Thadi to Mansarovar does not have railings or walls. Residents have complained that during monsoon, these nullahs overflow, which make it dangerous for commuters.

Krishna Maharishi, a resident of the area, said these are dangerous overbridges that were constructed by the Jaipur Development Authority (JDA) some time ago.

“There are no railings over these bridges. The nullah starts overflowing during monsoon and it gets slippery. Last year, a car fell off the bridge during monsoon. Authorities should take cognisance of this and build a railing before another tragedy occurs,” said Krishna.

There are no lights on the bridge as well making it dangerous to cross it at night. A mistake or a little lack of focus can cost the life of a commuter.

An official at JDA said the bridge near Shyam Nagar is not a part of Dravyawati river project. “There is a small railing and a pipeline going over the bridge that is giving commuters a bit of protection. However, if there is still a need, we will install a protective railing,” said an official.

In 2017, two people lost their lives at Kartarpura nullah in monsoon. After the incident, Jaipur Municipal Corporation (JMC) installed railings on both the sides. However, it still seems to be inadequate given to the low height of the bridge which makes it prone to waterlogging during rains. Instead of waiting for monsoon or any tragedy to occur, authorities must take some action right now.

464,['28/02/2020'],Citizens slam CMC move torecover hiked property tax,"This story is from February 28, 2020

Chandrapur: Claiming that Chandrapur Municipal Corporation ( CMC ) commissioner Sanjay Kakade’s “refusal” to roll back property tax hike, as directed by the high court , amounts to contempt of court, traders , industrialists and vigilant citizens from the city have demanded action against the officer.

Addressing a press conference here on Thursday, senior businessman Vinod Dattatray urged citizens to oppose the harsh recovery of property tax by the CMC.

“In 2016-17, the CMC had hiked property tax ranging between 500% and 1000% of around 68,000 properties and had disposed of more than 34,000 objections through manipulative hearings,” said Dattatray.

After the hike was challenged in the Nagpur bench of the Bombay high court, the division bench had quashed the hiked property tax levied on the citizens who had objected to it.

“The high court had quashed the CMC order demanding increased tax for 2016-2017 viz-a-viz the citizens of Chandrapur who had objected to the demand by filing complaints as per Rule 15 of the Taxation Rules (Chapter VIII of Schedule D of the Act),” said Dattatray while highlighting the court order. The HC had directed the CMC to issue fresh tax demand in consonance with the decision taken on the complaints of the citizens, he said.

Dattatray alleged that the municipal commissioner has deceived the citizens by publicly claiming that the court order was meant only for 47 petitioners. He claimed that on one hand the commissioner has warned property holders that none, other than the 47 petitioners, will be spared of the hiked property tax, on the other the CMC has informed the high court that it was promptly complying with its directives.

Many traders, industrialists, businessmen and hoteliers were present during the conference.

On February 14 , the state election commission wrote to the local self government (LSG) to provide information about reservation of wards by February 29 so that compliance of the orders of the high court by conducting elections in these bodies by April 18 can be achieved.

An official said, “In an order dated February 27, the directorate of local bodies (DLB) has issued a direction to these district election officers to draw lots in the six corporations comprising 560 municipal wards.”

The lottery will decide the category of a particular ward from where a candidate can contest. Of the newly formed 100 wards of Jaipur Heritage Municipal Corporation, 44 will be reserved for general candidates with 21 reserved for general category women.

Fourteen wards have been reserved for Other Backward Classes (OBCs) with 7 for OBC women; 7 for SC candidates (four for women) and two for STs (one for women).

LUCKNOW: More than 18,000 residents of apartments and housing colonies constructed and maintained by Lucknow Development Authority (LDA) will have to face an additional annual burden of Rs 12,460 each in the name of maintenance.The amount will be levied from next month as user charge for water supply and maintenance of the localities.The charge will be levied on residential and commercial properties in areas like Jankipuram, Gomtinagar Extension, Sarojininagar, Aashiana, Priyadarshni Colony and Mansarovar Colony by the end of March. The allottees will have to pay for water supply, garbage collection, maintenance of roads, cleaning and interlocking of drains, road sweeping, installation of streetlights and maintenance of parks.According to LDA officials, so far, LDA had offered these services for free though they cost Rs 6 crore annually. However, a proposal to change the freebie policy was mooted in the board meeting of the development authority in October. The decision was immediately approved by the committee in wake of a financial crunch caused by LDA properties that have remained unsold for years.However, residents of these housing colonies complain about the dilapidated condition of roads in their localities and irregular garbage collection.“We are happy to pay the amount if LDA improves the pathetic condition of roads. There is not a stretch in our locality which is not dotted with potholes,” said Laxmi Jha of LDA colony in Aashiana.Vinod Kumar of Mansarovar Colony said, “Nothing will change even after we pay this user charge. Garbage collection in our locality is so irregular that we have to hire a private worker for collecting daily waste from our households.”LDA chief engineer Indu Shekhar Singh said, “The decision has been taken to improve civic amenities provided to our allottees.

470,['28/02/2020'],HC seeks state govt plan on church takeover,"This story is from February 28, 2020

Kochi: The high court on Thursday asked the state government to inform its plan to implement the Supreme Court’s verdict at Kothamangalam church by Monday.

A division bench of Justice AM Shaffique and Justice Mary Joseph is considering an appeal by Ernakulam district collector challenging a single bench directive to take over the church and hand it over to the Orthodox faction. The directive was issued by the single bench on a petition by Orthodox priest Thomas Paul Ramban through advocate Roshen D Alexander.

During Thursday’s hearing, two members of the Jacobite faction informed the court that as parishioners, they are also filing appeals and that the appeal by the government should be heard along with their appeals. The court said it can only permit a priest appointed as per the 1934 constitution of the church to conduct religious services and that it cannot act against the apex court’s judgment.

The Orthodox faction alleged in court that the state government has a partisan attitude in the issue and is helping violators of the law and the Supreme Court’s judgment.

At this juncture, the court asked the Orthodox faction whether they intend to challenge the new ordinance brought in by the government. A counsel representing the Orthodox faction submitted that the full legislation has not yet become available and that a decision on a challenge could be taken only after that. The court said it may have to be considered whether the ordinance goes against the Supreme Court’s judgment, which limits the power to conduct religious services to a vicar in accordance with the 1934 church constitution.

State attorney KV Sohan submitted that the government has been formulating a scheme to implement the SC judgment at Kothamangalam church as was done in the case of Piravom church but it did not get the time to present it before the single bench. Following the submission, the court asked the government to produce the scheme before it on Monday.

LUCKNOW: While cities across the world are investing in development of city forests and installing giant air purifiers, Lucknow is lucky to have a lesser known wetland barely a few kilometres from Hazratganj. Located just behind the Atal Bihari Vajpayee International (Ekana) stadium in Gomtinagar Extension, the place is inhabited by over 100 species of indigenous and migratory birds, including some listed in Schedule 1 of the Wildlife Protection Act, according to naturalists and bird enthusiasts.Spread across 3-4 sq km area, the place is slowly losing out to infrastructure projects in the area. Fearing that the wetland might die, a group of bird watchers has urged CM Yogi Adityanath to save it. “The place will lose out to rising construction unless the government intervenes,” said wildlife enthusiast Vivek Awasthi, reminding that India has recently supported the Convention on Migratory Birds (CMS), the only UN treaty that address issue of migratory birds and their habitats.Naturalist Rahul Mishra—who has been visiting the place regularly for three years—added: “With deer, flocks of birds, bounty of fish and butterflies, place is a heaven on outskirts. Efforts must be made to save it before land sharks eat it up.”Another regular visitor, Ratindra Pandey, said: “Here is a chance for the government to give Lucknow an eco-tourism spot without much investment,” he said. Talking about the uniqueness of the place, birdwatcher Prakash Vir Singh said: “Some extremely rare and shy migratory birds make this their home every winter. This is in addition to regular presence of ducks, bee-eaters, kingfishers, sparrows, parakeets and jacanas. Animals like deer, golden jackal, monitor lizards, water snakes and butterflies can be spotted on wetland in the migratory season. I am preparing a compendium of birds sighted here.”Specialists lend support to the cause, stating that Ekana is an opportunity that the government must not miss in larger public interest.“It is not a matter of wildlife and bird enthusiasts alone. Wetlands are a crucial part of the ecosystem having multiple roles that directly affect all forms of life, especially humans. One of the most important roles of a wetland is to maintain groundwater level and facilitate its recharge, besides saving the river. In other words, wetland’s presence is associated with river Gomti’s quality, Lucknow’s lifeline,” said Sushmita Sengupta, project manager at Centre for Science and Environment.Kashif Imdad, a specialist in wetland conservation with WWF, said that in modern cities, wetlands serve as air filters and purifiers.“Increasing levels of air pollution level is affecting public life in a big way. Wetlands are a natural solution to the problem.

JAIPUR: Parliamentary affairs minister Shanti Dhariwal on Thursday said in assembly that tyre burst seems to be the cause of bus accident in which 24 people were killed in Bundi district on Wednesday. However, the discussion on the issue ended with walk out by Opposition members.

Dhariwal said, according to the report from the district relief management control room, the prima facie cause of the accident was a tyre burst. However, the matter is being investigated.

The vehicle had insurance and a temporary permit for a two-way trip from Kota to Sawai Madhopur where the marriage party was headed. Its fitness certificate was valid till September 20.

Dhariwal said the state's health and transport ministers went to Kota on Wednesday to offer their condolences to the families of the victims.

The state government has announced a compensation of Rs 2 lakh to the next of kin of those killed and Rs 40,000 for the injured. The government will also bear the expenditure on the education up to the college level of the victims’ children.

Deputy leader of Opposition Rajendra Rathore demanded the government to run a campaign against vehicles running without valid permit and fitness certificate.

He demanded that the compensation should be raised from Rs 2 lakh to Rs 10 lakh.

Leader of opposition Gulabchand Kataria said the government should take care of the future of the children whose family members were killed.

BJP MLA Chandrakanta Meghwal, while participating in the discussion said the bridge on the national highway where the accident took place was very narrow and dangerous.

After making a statement on the accident, Dhariwal targeted the opposition BJP by asking under whose tenure the highway was built.

As BJP members protested, speaker C P Joshi asked the minister to end his statement. The BJP MLAs then walked out of the House.

CHENNAI: Painfully aware that it has never promoted beach tourism or adventure sports on a large scale despite having the longest coastline in South India, Tamil Nadu tourism will soon display a theme video on the state’s beautiful sand stretches at 17 domestic and international airports across the country.The road linking Rameswaram and Dhanushkodi, which was rebuilt about two years ago, will be branded a ‘Calm to Storm destination and spruced up to kickstart the project that will also involve setting up an amphitheatre near Triveni Sangam at Kanyakumari. Dhanushkodi, about 20km from Rameswaram, was wiped out by a super-cyclone in 1964 and has been witnessing a tourism explosion since the road was rebuilt.In Chennai, state tourism department director V Amudhavalli said, a host of activities is planned including introducing a range of boats at Muttukadu and Mudaliarkuppam on ECR. “We are launching motor ski in the backwaters of the two facilities that have boathouses,” said Amudhavalli, who is also Tamil Nadu Tourism Development Corporation managing director.The state, with a coastline stretching more than 1,000 km from Pulicat in the north to Kanyakumari in the south and dotted with several beaches containing picturesque and heritage structures, could emerge as a hotspot for adventure tourism if the proper infrastructure is provided, said Tamil Nadu Tour Travel and Hospitality Association president V K T Balan. However, any adventure activities, including sailing, windsurfing, water skiing, scubadiving and river rafting, that are planned must be manned by licensed technicians trained by the Goa-based National Institute of Watersports, he cautioned, adding that about 75% of the state’s coastline has been underutilised.In the past, the government had with fanfare proposed a Sentosa theme park in Chennai, on the lines of the iconic facility with the same name in Singapore, a marina for yachts on the famous Marina, the second longest beach in the world, and a submarine museum off the Unesco-approved heritage town of Mamallapuram .

480,['28/02/2020'],Two men open fire at MIM leader’s home in Malegaon,"This story is from February 28, 2020

Nashik: Two unidentified people opened fire at the residence of senior AIMIM functionary Rizwan Khan in Malegaon city at around 2am on Thursday. Khan told TOI this was the second time that such firing had taken place at his residence.

Khan, a two-time former corporator of Malegaon Municipal Corporation, has lodged a complaint at the local police station. He told TOI two men had knocked on his door in the wee hours of Thursday, just an hour after he returned home.

The AIMIM leader, who is a college professor and a businessman, said the two men rang the door bell thrice. “I had returned home at around 1am. Both, me and my wife, were awake when the door bell rang. We did not open the door but checked through the window to see who had arrived so late in the night,” he told TOI.

The couple saw two men, who had covered their faces with cloth and carrying guns, at their door. A bike was parked near the entrance.

Khan claimed that the two suspects seemed to be upset when no one answered the door. “They got infuriated and started firing at the house. The glass panes of some of the windows broke and some bullets even pierced the furniture,” Khan said.

He added the suspects fled on the bike after the firing. Some of Khan’s neighbours alerted the local police about the incident and a police team soon reached Khan’s residence.

Nashik rural superintendent of police Arti Singh said suspects had fired four rounds at Khan’s residence but no one was injured in the incident. “We have launched a manhunt to nab the suspects,” she said.

She said the police have collected the CCTV footage from Khan’s residence and some of his neighbourhood homes and are scanning them for clues. Khan’s bunglow is located in the heart of Malegaon city.

Khan said that a couple of months after AIMIM won the Malegaon central seat for the first time in the assembly elections last year, unknown people had similarly opened fire at his house. “I had informed the police at that time about it. I am apprehensive that I am being targeted due to political reasons,” he claimed.

KOCHI: The high court on Thursday criticized CBSE for the way in which it handles the functioning of schools lacking affiliation . CBSE is playing with the future of students, the court said.

Justice SV Bhatti criticized CBSE when its regional director Sachin Thakur appeared before the court on Thursday as directed by the bench. The court is considering a petition by Arooja’s Educational and Charitable Trust through advocate B Sajeev Kumar.

During hearing, the court asked why CBSE is not taking any action against schools that are operating without affiliation. No enquiry or responsibility is being shown by CBSE after allowing schools to open across the state, the court criticized. If CBSE had even a bit of responsibility, the situation where these many students could not appear for the exams could have been avoided, the judge said. The court also said the issue of schools functioning without affiliation is a matter that affects the future of lakhs of students and even a small mistake on the part of CBSE cannot be entertained.

The court also asked the CBSE whether it was with its knowledge that the Arooja’s school had been allowing its students to appear for exams through another school. The court then asked CBSE to file a detailed affidavit explaining the issues highlighted by the court.

At the hearing, the court asked the state government to favourably consider whether the students of Arooja’s school can be permitted to appear for the board exams conducted by it. Though a counsel representing the state government had said that the students may not be interested in appearing for the state board exams, the court said let the parents and students decide on it at this stage. The state government should leave this option open for the students, the court said.

Scheduling further hearing on March 4, the court asked the CBSE regional officer to appear in court with all the documents and has also directed the investigating officer to be also present in court.

A delegation led by Congress Party President Sonia Gandhi meets President Ram Nath Kovind at Rashtrapati Bhawa... Read More

NEW DELHI: A day after holding the home minister responsible for the outbreak of riots in Delhi, a Congress delegation Thursday met President Ram Nath Kovind and urged him to sack Amit Shah from the Union Cabinet. The party asked the President to remind the Modi government of its “raj dharma”.

Congress met Kovind as part of its plan following the meeting of the CWC on Wednesday where it reviewed the communal violence in the capital and targeted the Centre and ruling BJP for the tragedy. The party demanded Shah’s resignation for not acting on time to avert the violence and former PM Manmohan Singh called the riots a “national shame”.

The delegation led by Congress chief Sonia Gandhi submitted a memorandum to the President in which it accused the Centre and also the Delhi government of being “mute spectators” instead of initiating steps to control the situation.

“You should immediately call for the removal of the home minister given the gross ineptitude, abdication of duty and his inability to contain the situation … We hope you will take decisive action on this matter,” states the memorandum, parts of which were read out by Sonia Gandhi to reporters at Rashtrapati Bhavan.

“Rashtrapatiji, you are given the highest possible responsibility under the Constitution of India: to act as the conscience keeper of this government and to remind it of its constitutional duty and the pillars of raj dharma by which any just government must abide,” Sonia said, flanked by former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, Ahmed Patel , A K Antony, Ghulam Nabi Azad, Mallikarjun Kharge , Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, Kumari Selja, Jitin Prasada among others.

She said the fact that the Delhi High Court had to step in and remind the Delhi Police of its duty to act against the rioters and the instigators, marked a “shameful indictment” of the central government, home ministry and the home minister.

“It is how the leaders and institutions of a country react in times of crisis that defines how we are remembered by history and the rest of the world. We cannot be found wanting in this hour,” the memorandum said.

Targeting Shah for the second day in succession, Sonia Gandhi asked, “What was he preoccupied with since last Sunday that he was unable, apparently, to give his attention to these grave events?”

Former PM Manmohan Singh told reporters, “We requested the President to use his power to call upon the central government to protect and preserve its ‘raj dharma’ so that the citizens of this country and this city are assured of peace, tranquility and justice.”

The opposition party also called it a failure of intelligence agencies and asked if they had provided any information which could have helped prevent the violence.

Sonia said the seeds of division were sown by the inflammatory remarks made by the BJP leaders during the recent Delhi elections.

Belagavi: Rumours of a Belagavi city resident having contracted the H1N1 virus and being afflicted with swine flu have proved to be just that, rumours. Officials in the Belagavi district health department confirmed that no samples had been dispatched to virology institutes either in Manipal, Udupi or in Pune. But, as a precautionary measure, the department has issued a notice to its personnel to remain vigilant against a possible breakout.

Following reports of a case of swine flu being confirmed in Belagavi, anxiety gripped a section of residents. However, as of Thursday evening, the Belagavi district health office has not received any confirmation. All private health institutions including the Karnataka Lingayat Education Society (KLE) hospital have been ordered to report positive cases of H1N1 to the competent government authorities.

A state-wide alert has been issued following detection of H1N1 cases being reported in parts of Karnataka. Most of these cases have been reported from the state capital, Bengaluru, and the officials in the district administration across Karnataka have been asked to leave no stone unturned in monitoring these cases.

Belagavi district health officer Shashikant Muniyal confirmed to TOI that no case of swine flu had been reported in the district this year. “These are just rumours. No case of H1N1 has been reported in the district,” said Muniyal.

He said that all primary health centres, taluk hospitals had been directed to monitor the health of those reporting with respiratory illnesses more closely. The key symptoms for swine flu have been classified into three categories: A, B and C. While minor breathing problems and regular cough are classified under ‘A’ and ‘B’ categories, and patients reporting to health centres with these symptoms will be sent home with medicines, personnel have been instructed to admit those patients complaining of more serious troubles.

Muniyal added that samples would be dispatched to virology centres if cases that arounsed genuine suspicion were reported in the district.

NEW DELHI: The International Narcotics Control Board (INCB) in its 2019 annual report released on Thursday has said that India is a significant source of trafficked opioid Tramadol that are seized worldwide. It has also raised concern about large-scale illicit cultivation of cannabis in the country and its long-term impact on children.

Releasing the report, Jagjit Pavadia, member of the INCB and head of its finance committee, expressed concern about the extent of substance abuse by the young population. The report has highlighted the connection between the use of alcohol & tobacco and the use of psychoactive substances like cannabis, opiates and cocaine by children and adolescents. Quoting a survey of drug abusers, the report says the median age of onset of use for these substances is 16–19 years for alcohol and tobacco, 18–19 years for cannabis and 21–24 years for cocaine.

“Longitudinal studies that have followed children into adulthood indicate that the earlier the age of onset for alcohol, tobacco and cannabis use, the greater the likelihood of use of drugs such as opiates and cocaine,” it said. The research has explored this relationship and has shown that genetic, biological and societal factors are associated with this progression, it added.

“An analysis of data from 2010 to 2017 shows that India is among those countries worldwide with the greatest extent of illicit cannabis cultivation and production,” the report said. Though enforcement agencies in India eradicated 1,980 hectares of illicit cannabis in 2018, less than the 3,446 hectares destroyed in 2017, the actual illicit cultivation could be many times more.

Director general (DG) of the Narcotics Control Bureau Rakesh Asthana and DG of directorate of revenue intelligence Balesh Kumar were also present on the occasion and both expressed the desire for a higher coordination among Indian agencies to control trafficking of drugs and their abuse.

US President Trump’s massive rally in Ahmedabad could sway some Indian-American voters (AFP photo)

NEW DELHI: That India has a Democratic Party problem in the US became clear on Thursday when presidential hopeful Bernie Sanders weighed in on the Delhi riots, targeting the Modi government and US President Donald Trump in an equal opportunity tweet.

While the obvious jibe was against Trump, by emphasising that he thought the riots were only aimed against Muslims, Sanders was indirectly criticising the Modi government as well. He is not alone.

Democrat Congressman Joaquin Castro (Texas) added his own criticism. “These deaths in New Delhi are tragic, and the actions of those responsible must be condemned. Support for the US-India relationship has always been based on our shared values. I urge the Indian government to live up to those values and take decisive action to end further violence,” he tweeted.

Jamie Raskin, a Democrat Congressman from Maryland, tweeted, “Horrified by the deadly violence unfolding in India, all fuelled by religious hatred and fanaticism. Liberal democracies must protect religious freedom and pluralism, and avoid the path of discrimination and bigotry.” He was joined by Don Beyer, Democrat from Virginia, who said, “I condemn attacks against Muslims in India, and reject violence, bigotry and religious intolerance. The US state department should too.”

Even the chairman of the US House Foreign Affairs Committee , Eliot Engel, joined in, “Deeply troubled by the deaths from the communal violence in India over the past couple of days. The right to protest is a key aspect in democracy, but they must remain peaceful and police must ensure the safety of all.”

In the past six months, PM Narendra Modi has shared a political stage with Trump twice, once in the US and this week in Ahmedabad. The question has been asked whether India is making a mistake putting its eggs in the Republican basket, to the detriment of its traditional ties with the Democratic Party.

To say this will not have political implications in a fiercely polarised election year battle in the US will be myopic in the extreme, particularly since Indian-Americans form an influential voting bloc, as do Pakistani-Americans. Therefore, no Democrat politician looking for re-election can afford to ignore events in India, which might sway voters. Indian-Americans overwhelmingly vote Democrat, though in recent years, there has been some move towards the Republicans. US political watchers say Trump’s massive rally in Ahmedabad could sway some Indian-American voters, which would be a matter of concern to Democrats.

That said, there is increasingly a section within the so-called “progressive” Democrats who say they find nothing to commend and, therefore, are alienated by Modi’s India. Certainly, after the events of the past six months — from the negation of Article 370 to the citizenship laws — the liberal Democrat opinion has veered away from India, increasingly labelling it with words like “Hindu nationalist”, “fascist” et al. Increasingly too, there is a growing sympathy for global voices against “Islamophobia” and Modi’s India seems to be the perfect example of that.

In addition, the Indian system has made little effort to engage Democrats or the liberal opinion makers, like Ro Khanna, who is Sanders’s foreign policy head. On Capitol Hill too, there is a striking dearth of Indian voices attempting to engage US lawmakers on issues of contention. Meanwhile, a resolution in the House “urging the Republic of India to end the restrictions on communications and mass detentions in Jammu and Kashmir as swiftly as possible and preserve religious freedom for all residents” by India-sceptic Pramila Jayapal has got around 63 co-sponsors.

In a belated attempt to mend fences, last week saw the visit of a bipartisan congressional delegation to India comprising senior Democrat Ami Bera (California) and Republican George Holding (North Carolina). They emphasised the bipartisan nature of US Congressional support for India, but this consensus is clearly failing. Sources in the Indian government said a fresh outreach to the Democrat leadership was being planned, which would be helmed by the newly-appointed ambassador to the US, Taranjit Singh Sandhu.

CHENNAI: A minor girl who was lured into prostitution and was being taken to a prospective client was rescued by her brother on Thursday, police said.

K Prakash, 30, told the girl that he would give her a huge sum of money if she accompanied him to meet a friend. She boarded a car with Prakash from Villivakkam.

When the vehicle neared the Arumbakkam metro station, the girl's brother, an autorickshaw driver, saw her. He confronted his sister who told him that Prakash was her friend. But the autorickshaw driver forcibly opened the car's door and picked a quarrel with Prakash. By then, another man, identified as Faizal, came there.

On information, a patrol team from the Choolaimedu police rushed to the spot. Seeing police, Faizal fled. Prakash, the girl and her brother were taken to a police station for interrogation. Prakash, who has burglary cases pending against him at the Avadi Tank Factory police station, told police he was on his way to Faizal's house in Chitlapakkam. He told police that he knew the girl for a year and had been going out with her.

Police arrested Prakash and seized his car and a machete.

Police have launched a hunt for Faizal and are probing to find out if Faizal was a customer or an accomplice of Prakash.

The old emblem (left). The new one reading ‘Tamil Nadu Government’

CHENNAI: It was the last emblem of the state government featuring the word Madras, until the highways department began a renovation project about four months ago. Now, the seal over the pylon on Maraimalai Adigal bridge in Saidapet , built across the Adyar river, reads ' Tamil Nadu Government'.

The 'Government of Madras' seal painted on top of the pylon has remained untouched for more than 50 years as it did not attract the attention of the highways department that maintains the bridge.

Heritage enthusiasts say such words on a state government emblem cannot be found anywhere in the city. Writer R Venkatesh said Madras began to be replaced on emblems after the state was renamed Tamil Nadu in 1968.

The Maraimalai Adigal bridge has a historical value, with the original Marmalong bridge built in 1726 by Armenian merchant Coja Petrus Uscan to record the Madras Tercentenary Commemoration Volume. While the bridge is believed to have been named after the village of Marmalong or Marmalan identified with Mambalam, it still has a commemorative plaque in multiple languages including Arabic and Armenian regarding the construction of the original structure. Later, the bridge was rebuilt in 1966 when all government structures had Government of Madras tag. The bridge was also renamed after Tamil scholar Maraimalai Adigal.

BJP National President JP Nadda a during a welcome rally, in Solan in Himachal Pradesh (PTI photo)

NEW DELHI: BJP on Thursday attributed the communal violence in North-East Delhi to “hate and inciting” speeches by opposition leaders over the past couple of months with Union minister Prakash Javadekar referring to Congress chief Sonia Gandhi’s call for “aar par ki ladai” (fight to the finish) during a rally against the citizenship law in December.

Addressing a press conference, Javadekar also cited some comments of Congress members Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra even as he pointed to the alleged recovery of stones, petrol bombs and acid from the rooftop of AAP councillor Tahir Hussain. He accused Congress and AAP of “politicising” the riots.

“Who started this? This did not happen in two days. People were being instigated for the past two months. After the Citizenship (Amendment) Act was passed on December 11, Congress held a rally at Ramlila Maidan on December 14 where Sonia Gandhi said now we have to decide: Is paar ya us paar'. Is this not instigation?” Javadekar asked, adding, “Our leaders like PM Narendra Modi , Amit Shah and Rajnath Singh talk about welfare of all.”

The minister alleged that there is ""selective silence"" among Congress and AAP leaders. “Mani Shankar Aiyar went to Pakistan and said we find hope in Shaheen Bagh. Salman Khurshid and Shashi Tharoor have supported protests like this. They are so vocal about Shaheen Bagh but they are selectively silent on reports by channels that an AAP corporator's house has become a factory of riots. All kinds of ammunition, petrol bombs, stones of various sizes have been found from his house. Why is Congress silent on this?"" Javadekar said.

He said opposition leaders instigated people which resulted in violence. “Priyanka Gandhi said hundreds of people will be put behind bars. Is this not misinterpretation? Rahul Gandhi said: 'Don't worry. We are with you' ... they stoked fears,"" he said.

Asked about alleged provocative statements made by BJP members like Kapil Mishra, he said the matter is in court and added that AAP MLA Amanatullah Khan and AIMIM leader Waris Pathan made speeches that incited people.

""Amanatullah, who is now in AAP, said 'you won't be allowed to wear skull caps'. Can you tell me where this is written in CAA? All these are inflammatory statements, but Congress and AAP have not uttered a single word,” he said.

Javadekar said the situation in North-East Delhi is under control, probe has been fast-tracked and it will bring out the real culprits behind this violence. “However, Chief Minister (Kejriwal) is speaking in Assembly about the religion of those who were killed,” he said adding that identifying riot victims is also violation of norms.

Javadekar said the elected representatives from the violence-hit areas have been absent from the scene. “Why are the other political parties silent on attacks on policemen and journalists and death of IB officer Ankit Sharma ?”

Dismissing Congress’ demand for Amit Shah’s resignation, he credited the home minister with effective handling of the situation and the role of the Delhi Police for “return of peace” in the areas in the last two days.

492,['28/02/2020'],"BMC spots tender clause mischief, saves Rs 20 crore","This story is from February 28, 2020

Borivli railway station where the skywalk project is to be undertaken

MUMBAI: The cost of building a skywalk in Borivli dropped by Rs 20 crore after the BMC removed a tender clause that had allegedly been incorporated to favour some contractors.

A contractor had quoted Rs 85 crore to build the skywalk from Borivli railway station to the Western Express Highway near the Sanjay Gandhi National Park gate , via MG Road .

Last September, the BMC invited tenders for the project and the standard bid document stipulated that the bidders should be experienced in undertaking similar work elsewhere with the project cost having been at least 40% of the proposed Borivli project. Subsequently, in a hush-hush manner, the municipal administration increased to 60% from 40% the minimum work cost requirement. The result was that only four contractors qualified for the work.

The BMC short-listed M E Infraprojects, who quoted Rs 85 crore for the work. There were allegations of cartelisation where the contractors formed a group but bid separately to increase the cost and keep other players out.

Samajwadi Party corporator Rais Shaikh demanded the municipal commissioner should scrap the practice of putting specific conditions in tenders which led to cartelisation and favouritism. He alleged that it was causing the BMC losses. After Shaikh raised the issue with the municipal commissioner, the BMC scrapped the first process and invited fresh tenders without making any changes in the standard bid document.

The result was that another contractor who had earlier quoted Rs 93 crore for the work, reduced the quote to Rs 65 crore. He was the lowest bidder and the BMC finalised him for the work.

The proposal is now to be placed before the standing committee for approval. This time five bidders participated in the process and the lowest bidder among them was API Civilcon, who had quoted Rs 65 crore for the work.

When the same contractor had quoted Rs 93 crore for the same work earlier, he had been the second-lowest bidder after ME Infraprojects.

Five years ago, after the road and desilting scams surfaced, the BMC introduced a standard bid document asking all its department to follow it while inviting tenders, without adding any specific condition. Recently the BMC again started to alter the condition in the standard bid document, which the corporators allege is an attempt to favour some contractors.

""We insist on following the standard bid document while inviting tenders. It ensures that the officials do not use their discretionary power to add specific conditions to favour select contractors. It will keep cartelisation away and save taxpayer money,"" Shaikh said.

DHARWAD: Calling for a revamp of the existing healthcare system in the country, retired professor at the Tata Institute of Social Sciences N Jayaram on Thursday said that the present infant and maternal mortality rates in India were deeply distressing.

The keynote speaker at the national symposium on ‘Health Policies and Programmes for Development: Achievements and Priorities’ organised by the department of sociology, Karnatak University, Jayaram said, “Malnutrition is the other area that is a cause for concern in India. Now increasing cases of mental depression also has a socio-cultural dimension to it as well. An increasing number of youngsters falling prey to diabetes is also disturbing.”

Jayaram sought to highlight the need for the people of a country to remain healthy if the nation was to develop at a steady pace. “Despite improvement in healthcare facilities, number of diseases in only rising,” he added.

Linguist and scholar GN Devy said that India, the economic policy of which hinged on both socialist and capitalist principles, ought to adopt a similar approach in the healthcare sector. “In the healthcare sector, partnerships between government bodies and corporate entities is absent,” he said.

TR Chandrashekhar, Jagan Karade, SC Natikar, SC Shettar, Dhruva Jyothi, Hanumagouda and Shoukat Azeem were among those who presented papers during the symposium.

A resolution seeking a healthcare policy friendly to the people, along with rolling out of specific programmes to treat diseases afflicting those in the vulnerable section such as Adivasis, women and construction works was passed at the end of the event.
