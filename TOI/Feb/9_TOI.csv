1,['9/02/2020'],Bangalore Nagarathnamma’s life story needed to be narrated: Nagabharana,"Veteran filmmaker and theatreperson TS Nagabharana is known to bring alive interesting personalities either on screen or on the stage — be it Allama Prabhu or Shishunala Sharifa. His latest play, Vidya Sundari Bengaluru Nagarathnamma, is about the life of courtesan, artiste and activist Bangalore Nagarathnamma . He reveals how this play came into existence.Nagabharana says, “I always wanted to do a musical on stage, especially one that would have Carnatic music . This has always been on the back of my mind and I was searching for a relevant play. In the meantime, I got an offer to do a biopic on Bangalore Nagarathnamma, based on a book on her. So, I began working on the script. However, while doing so, I realised that it was very hard to capture her life in a film. That’s when I decided to begin by doing a play on her,” he explains. He further says, “I was intrigued by the way she pursued music. The research for the play took almost a year. It was only after I successfully staged the play that I had the confidence to make a film based on her life.”Nagabharana also says that his research led him to see how two facets of her — a cultural icon and an activist — that were intrinsic the narrative. He also explains that her feminism and activism was much ahead of her times. “Before all the ‘isms’ came into existence, she held her ground for so many things. While she was an activist, she also held a just temperament. One can identify her in two ways. If she was an activist on one side, she was an artiste, who made a difference to the cultural ethos, on the other. One cannot take away her accomplishments as a musician and dancer. I must stress on her contribution, especially to harikathe, as she trained devadasi girls in the form,” he explains.Nagabharana does not discount the possibility of a film on Nagarathnamma’s life. He says, “The film on her is definitely on the cards. I do not know when it will happen, as it will mean another year of research and other intricacies. Once we have that perfect script in place, this film will go on floors.” The play, though, is slated to be staged sooner. “Our next performance is at Gayana Samaja on February 19,” he signs off.",entertainment,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74031460,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-330481/74031460.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/kannada/theatre/bangalore-nagarathnammas-life-story-needed-to-be-narrated-nagabharana/articleshow/74031460.cms
2,['9/02/2020'],The New Boudoir Pin-up!,"There’s a new sensuality at play in the countdown to Valentine’s Day 2020 – boudoir photoshoots. Women are heating up social media with risqué shoots. For the uninitiated, a boudoir is a woman’s private sitting room or salon, usually between the dining room and bedroom. On Instagram, these sensuous shoots are the new tease in #couplegoals, with hashtag #somethingboudoir getting 4.2 million posts, #boudoir getting 4.6 million posts. Photographer Sarika Gangwal believes social media has helped create a demand for boudoir shoots. “Boudoir photography is all about loving yourself and feeling good in your body. It’s an experience of discovering your sensuality,” she says. Her tip: expression is everything as there is a thin line between sensuality and vulgarity. Gangwal adds that camera anxiety is a real thing. A reason why she tells her models to relax, and creates a mood where they feel comfortable. “I always play some music in the background. I’ve done sexy boudoir shoots of women in sarees – it highlights the curves. The big change is people are opening up their desires to feel good about themselves and their body,” she adds.The photographer is officially now in the bedroom. Pre-wedding shoots are passé as to-be brides are preparing to gift their fiancés a little ‘secret’ shoot. Or it could be couples trying to spice things up. Even single women are resorting to it to express their love for their bodies. Photographer Priyanka Sachar notes that people do boudoir shoots for various reasons: to preserve their youthful looks, to surprise their partner, improve their body image – as a couple or single person. People of all ages, shapes, sizes and sexual orientation like to try out boudoir photography. “The mood at these shoots is casual yet glamorous. It is a special day for the person(s) getting the shoot done. I go with an all-women team of make-up artist, hair stylist and photographer (me). The participants are made to feel comfortable. Music is played to keep the atmosphere lively. Boudoir photography can be artistic as well as elegant. It is not titillating or crude.”Boudoir photography emphasises the power and sensuality of ordinary individuals — primarily women — at an extraordinary point in their lives, notes photographer Pratik Sanghi, and adds, “The pictures express their feeling about their own relationships and, done well, depict them at their most desirable and powerful.” Sanghi likes to shoot high contrast black and whites images, usually in their homes where they are most comfortable. “My main goal is to visually convey heavy romance and intimacy and not shoot erotic portraits. In boudoir shoots, we limit the intimacy maximum to kissing. It takes a few minutes for them to get in the zone especially when it comes to getting comfortable with their bodies. I show them every image we shoot to make them feel completely at ease.”Thanks to Instagram, the interest in boudoir photography is showing a revival. Brides-to-be are stripping down either partially or completely and paying to have soft-sensual photos taken of themselves as a gift for their grooms. The job of boudoir photographers is to be “very discreet”; and most photographers are under strict contract. The favourite outfit is lingerie, but women often choose to wear what they feel most comfortable in – be it a saree, dress, shirt, garter belts, etc. The common misconception is that boudoir photography is nude or borderline pornographic. This is not true at all as these photos can range from intimate and sweet to straight-up provocative. They can also feature themes like popular pin-ups, burlesque or something trendy such as steampunk. Photographer Noopur says that it’s being fuelled by women who want to showcase their confidence. She says, “They are not shy and very comfortable in their own skin. Social media has made women (and men) own their sensuality. They have shed their inhibitions and are lovingly flaunting their bodies.” It’s like your bedroom is no longer off limits.The favourite outfit is lingerie, but women choose to wear what they feel most comfortable in – be it a saree, dress, a shirt, garter beltsCouples are hiring photographers to shoot intimate portraits in their bedrooms to celebrate their relationship – and also feel empowered and sexy. They want to create something memorable other than a pre-wedding shoot. Last year, we had a bride gift her fiancé a boudoir shoot. It is the new sexy.- Pratik Sanghi, photographerThe favourite outfit is lingerie, but women choose to wear what they feel most comfortable in – be it a saree, dress, a shirt, garter belts- Relax and be comfy in your own skin. It’s important to trust your photographer- Your images have to evoke emotions. Boudoir photos shouldn’t be cold- Consider the outfits you’d like to wear. Be creative with your outfit choices and styling- Create a mood board. Dark and moody? Cheeky and flirty? Girly and sassy? Black and white? Have a clear idea of the vibe you want- Figure out your poses. Some of the common ones include sitting on knees, lying on your back, putting legs up against a wall, lying on your side, sitting on a stool, etc. Arched backs, leg lifts and torso twists are used to achieve sexy poses- You can use interesting props, such as stools, canopy beds, pillows, furry throws, sexy shoes and classy lingerieThumb image: Instagram/Sarika Gangwal",life-style,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73985902,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-572403/73985902.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//life-style/fashion/buzz/the-new-boudoir-pin-up/articleshow/73985902.cms

I couldn’t understand what that magic was. From then on, I haven’t missed catching his movies on the first day, except for once in 2013. During my school days, I thought my craze for him would come down once I joined college, but it only intensified as years went by. Travelling to Chennai from Bengaluru has become a norm over the last few years, mainly to catch the FDFS of his movies.I got to know that Ajith sir was shooting for Viswasam in Hyderabad. I booked a room in the same hotel where he was staying in. I took a flight to Hyderabad from Bengaluru at 6am and reached there by around 8am. I kept waiting in the lobby till 4pm without having food hoping to meet him. The staff kept asking me who I was waiting for and I gave them one reason or the other. I befriended a Bengaluru-based staff there, and he informed me Ajith sir would return to his room from the shoot only by 11pm. So, I went to my room, freshened up and waited in the lobby again till 1am. Then, I got to know that Thala would be in only by 4am. So, I went back to my room, slept for a couple of hours and returned to the lobby, only to get disappointed again. Later, I got to know that he was staying on the seventh floor. I was also told that he usually went to his floor through a service lift directly from the basement. So, at around 12pm, I checked out my room and booked a suite on the seventh floor, which cost `24,000.This time, I was more hopeful because the service lift was right opposite my room. At around 9.40pm, I finally met him! I went near him and said, ‘Hi sir’. He asked me who I was and enquired how I had managed to meet him. I was totally dumbstruck and couldn’t utter a word for some time. He then asked me to be calm and invited me to his room. He said he doesn’t expect his fans to visit him through such means because that would disturb the production. He gave me water and asked me about my family and advised me to take care of them and my health.I showed him a few photos of his birthday celebration, which we had organised in Melbourne a few days earlier. And I also spoke about how I had enjoyed watching some of his films. I then gifted him a branded watch that I had bought in Singapore. I had bought it because I had read somewhere that he loved that particular brand. But he refused to accept it as he felt that would send out a wrong message. Instead, he tied it on my hand, saying, ‘This is AK’s present for you’. I didn’t know what to say when he said ‘sorry’ for making me wait for so long.",entertainment,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74029979,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-863928/74029979.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/tamil/movies/news/fan-moment-i-was-totally-dumbstruck-says-chandrashekar/articleshow/74029979.cms

6,['9/02/2020'],The Magic of Omega 3,"For the longest time fats have got a bad reputation and are considered artery-clogging and fattening. However just like there are good carbohydrates and bad carbohydrates, there are good fats and bad fats too. There is a reason why fat is classified as a macronutrient and nearly every single cell in our body needs fats to function the right way. Our brain is largely composed of fat, hormones are made from fat, certain key vitamins like A, D, E, K are absorbed by the body in the presence of fat, so chasing a fat-free diet can be downright dangerous for our health – right from skin and hair health, ageing process, hormonal imbalance, lack of satiety from meals, energy and much more. Amongst all kinds of fats, there is one in particular that is of great nutritive as well as therapeutic value. That is omega 3 fatty acid (FA). There are three kinds of Omega 3 FA – ALA, EPA and DHA. While ALA comes mostly from plants, nuts and seeds, DHA and EPA come from fatty fish.Your brain is almost 60 per cent fat and half of that comprises the Omega 3 kinds. This nutrient is used to build brain and nerve cells, and is responsible for cognitive memory and overall brain function. It also helps keep brain inflammation in check thereby being one of the necessary nutrients in managing and preventing cases of Parkinson’s, Alzheimer’s, autism, ADHD, cerebral palsy. A deficiency of this nutrient is linked to learning impairment, depression and poor memory and is even associated with depression and anxiety cases. It is also used in cases of schizophrenia and other mental disorders because it is nutrition for the brain and nervous system. Omega 3 holds the potential to protect nerve damage and helps them regenerate.Omega 3 plays a big role in healing our heart and the cardiovascular system. It helps boost HDL (good cholesterol), lowers LDL and triglycerides (bad cholesterol) and helps reduce chances of heart stroke and inflammation in the heart. It helps repair the endothelial linings of artery walls that are damaged due to various lifestyle factors, especially smoking.Chronic inflammation can contribute to almost any illness known today, right from obesity to cancer. Omega 3 plays a vital role in calming down the body’s inflammatory responses and oxidative stress.A fat-deprived diet can play havoc on our hormonal health. Hence all fad diets that ask you to go fat-free can be dangerous for your hormonal health because they lack the key nutrient that helps manufacture hormones.Omega 3, specifically DHA, helps form the structural component of the retina in our eyes and hence its deficiency can affect vision and possibly cause macular degeneration and other vision impairment issues. It is also responsible for a healthy skin and gives it the soft, moist, supple, wrinkle-free appearance. It works as a natural sunblock as it safeguards the skin from damage due to excessive and inappropriate exposure.Omega 3 is crucial when it comes to cellular health and energy. It is what makes up the cell membrane and its deficit can affect the overall functioning of a cell. As for energy levels, even a one per cent decrease in Omega 3 in your body can cause tiredness and continual low energy levels.Consult your health care provider before introducing any of the discussed foods into your lifestyleOmega 3 can be obtained from both vegetarian as well as non-vegetarian sources, however the primary source is fatty fish like salmon, tuna, trout, mackerel, sardines and herring. In veg food, it is found mostly in nuts and seeds like flaxseeds, chia seeds, walnuts, hemp seeds. Marine algae also provides Omega 3, especially DHA and that is how fish get them too. There is also an option of a good quality Omega 3 or a fish oil supplement in case food sources don’t sufficeOils rich in Omega 3 like flaxseed are not suitable for high heat cooking as they are extremely sensitive to heat exposure. They are best consumed raw.",life-style,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74005072,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-1207867/74005072.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//life-style/health-fitness/health-news/the-magic-of-omega-3/articleshow/74005081.cms

From bell bottoms to ruffles to polka dots, everything is trendy once again. While clothes are going back in time, jewellery trends are no less. Cue in drumroll for the return of the 90s staple: charm jewellery. Popularised as ‘the’ cool thing to wear by Madonna, charms have come a long way from being dainty baubles to chunky leather and beaded variants. The popularity of the evil-eye has added a new talisman to the trinkets.Charms — earlier common in bracelets — can now be added to anything from anklets to necklaces and earrings. In fact, at the Met Gala 2019, Elle Fanning added kitschy charms to her nail art! Evidence of charms in jewellery dates back to prehistoric times when they were made from shells and animal bones. Credit goes to Queen Victoria (who ruled from 1876-1901) to fashion the modern-day charm bracelet. She not only liked wearing the bracelets but also gifted them, taking care to personalise the charms to fit the recipient. In fact, she had a “mourning” bracelet made to mourn Prince Albert’s death. Among the charms on this bracelet was a locket with his miniature photograph, locket of his hair, and mementos of their life together.The nostalgic jewellery trend by way of charms, engraved ornaments or refurbishing heirloom pieces is officially cool again. Today, you can express yourself with the bracelet itself, and not just its charms. Pick charms that hold a special meaning to you. Designers like Alexander McQueen, Gucci, Oscar de la Renta gave it high-fashion cred.

13,['9/02/2020'],Churchill Brothers face defending champions Chennai City,"This story is from February 9, 2020

Panaji: The goals are back, so are the smiles, and confidence too. But Churchill Brothers FC coach Bernardo Tavares is waiting for more proof that his squad can go all the way in the I-League .

For a club that doesn’t appreciate second-placed finishes and consolation prizes, the top spot remains the goal. It looked like they were on the right track when they won three matches in a row at the start, but an unexpected drop in performance that saw them lose points against comparatively weaker teams, even at home, raised doubts.

Thanks to a 4-1 demolition of Neroca FC in the previous game, those doubts have somewhat disappeared. Churchill’s credentials will be put to the test again as they face defending champions Chennai City FC at the Nehru Stadium in Fatorda on Sunday.

“The victory (against Neroca) came after a difficult week when we lost against TRAU (at home) and Gokulam Kerala. The TRAU game was bad. We couldn’t convert our chances, and everyone wondered how could we lose? Against Gokulam, we were good in the second half, but everyone remembers the result and nothing else,” said Tavares.

Churchill are sixth in the table with 13 points from eight matches. Even if they win their two remaining matches in hand, both at home, they would still remain four points behind leaders Mohun Bagan, although crucially they would have overtaken everyone else.

“We have many games to play and anything can happen. I cannot say whether team A or B will become champions. We must think about the next game. Step by step, if we win games, we will be nearer to our goal,” said Tavares.

Midfielder Quan Gomes was more forthright. “This team can become champions. We have to keep winning,” said Quan, singling out leaders Mohun Bagan as the team to watch out for this season.

Churchill’s immediate worry is Chennai City. The defending champions are a far cry from the team that had a band of experienced Spaniards and young Indian players, winning a tightly contested league last season. Akbar Nawas’s side have lost players and, possibly, the spark too. But what they have retained is their philosophy and style of play.

“Chennai love to have the ball. They have good quality in the middle. If they have the ball, they are happy. We must deny them ball possession. We must keep the ball away from them,” said Tavares.

With just 11 points from their first nine matches, no team will be happy while defending their title. Understandably, Nawas doesn’t like his teams position as well, as they are much closer to the relegation zone than the title which they won so majestically last season.

“We must still aim to be champions, sure. I mean, if the goal has changed, that’s not the way how we proceed. We still aim to collect three points in every game.

14,['9/02/2020'],Shubh Mangal Zyada Saavdhan cast shoots with Bappi Lahiri for retro track,"The cast of Shubh Mangal Zyada Saavdhan got into retro mode when they shot for the recreated version of the 80s hit track Yaar Bina Chain Kaha Re from Saaheb (1985). This time around, however, the title of the song is Arrey Pyaar Kar Le . To recreate the 80s, a set was erected at a studio in Mumbai, which had all the elements of that era, including an illuminated, colourful dance floor, a shiny disco ball and dancers wearing bell-bottom pants. The highlight on the day of the shoot was Bappi Lahiri ’s arrival on the set to shoot for his guest appearance in the song. Along with Ayushmann Khurrana and Jitendra Kumar, who are the film’s lead actors, Neena Gupta, Gajraj Rao and Maanvi Gagroo will also be featuring in the film.Speaking about choosing this track for the film, director Hitesh Kewalya says, “We wanted to show that same-sex love has been existing since a long time. We picked this 80s hit dance number as we felt that it celebrated the emotion of love very well.” Recreated by Tanishk Bagchi, the song, which releases tomorrow, has a rap portion penned by Vayu with vocals by Ayushmann. The team has retained Bappi Lahiri’s composition and voice from the original in the new version. Bappi Lahiri says, “I am happy that the film is keeping disco music from the 80s alive. The switch from seeing Anil Kapoor and Amrita Singh dancing in the original to Ayushmann Khurrana and Jitendra Kumar romancing each other in this redux version, is just phenomenal.”",entertainment,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74014693,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-153527/74014693.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/hindi/bollywood/news/shubh-mangal-zyada-saavdhan-cast-shoots-with-bappi-lahiri-for-retro-track/articleshow/74014693.cms

Yogesh Praveen (BCCL/ Farhan Ahmad Siddiqui)

Overwhelmed on being awarded the fourth highest civilian award, Padma Shri for his outstanding contribution in the field of Literature and Education, Lucknowite and historian Dr Yogesh Praveen has been busy with congratulatory calls and messages ever since the news came out. “It feels great to be honoured with such a prestigious award like the Padma Shri. I would like to specially mention my mother because she contributed immensely in winning this award as she kept me going and always motivated me, unhone mujhe kabhi tootne nahi diya,” says Praveen.An expert in the history and culture of Avadh, specifically Lucknow, Dr Yogesh has written over two dozen books. “Rang laati hai henna patthar pe pis jaane ke baad. This quotation is apt for me as I have been working constantly without any kind of desire or expectations. And this award proves ki sacche mann se ki hui tapasya kabhi vyarth nahi jaati. Anvarat kaam karta raha aur yeh kabhi socha nahi ki raasta asaan hoga, thokre bahut khaayi hain maine.” Quoting Mirza Ghalib, he adds, “Once Mirza Ghalib was asked who is your ustaad, he replied ‘thokren hi meri ustaad rahin’, so for me also my failures have been my teacher, my mentor.”Yogesh Praveen (BCCL/ Farhan Ahmad Siddiqui)Because of his expertise in the history and culture of Avadh, he has been part of several films based on it. He has also written the lyrics for the Shyam Benegal directed film Junoon. His inputs were also taken for the film Umraao Jaan. “I always got respect from everyone, even many filmmakers approached me for films based on Avadh. Humein nawaazne waale film industry se bhi bahut aaye. Shyam Benegal, Shashi Kapoor, Farooque Sheikh, Rekha, Satyajit Ray, Shabana Azmi to name a few,” he says.Sharing his concern for the city Praveen says, “Lucknow has become hotch-potch and uski rooh bhi tabah ho rahi hai. The city has joined the mad race like other cities without knowing where it is heading. With the government changing names of places, many people come to me and ask ki Lucknow ko Lakshmanpur kiya jaye toh kaisa rahega. So I request them to divide the city into two parts with Gomti river at the centre because it is a state capital and needs to have a proper development. Making twin cities like Hyderabad and Secunderabad will have two nagar nigams which will facilitate better development. And then rename the old city as Lucknow and the other one as Lakshmanpur. It feels insulting when people say naya Lucknow and purana Lucknow as purana feels like a waste so I think this renaming and division should be done.”",lucknow,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74027323,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-303587,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/it-feels-great-to-be-honoured-with-a-prestigious-award-like-the-padma-shri-yogesh-praveen/articleshow/74027308.cms

Flooded with congratulatory messages, noted vocalist Pt Chhannulal Mishra , who has recently been conferred with Padma Vibhushan award, says, “I am really elated to get this recognition. It is an honour to be selected for this award. Though I feel that I should have received this award a trifle earlier, at the same time, as the popular adage goes, der aye durust aaye. I am happy that it has eventually happened,” says the artist who is already a recipient of Padma Bhushan award.However, Pt Mishra believes that classical music needs to adapt itself to the changed times in order to attract the younger audiences. “In this fast-paced world, the artistes should perform accordingly. Pehle ek dhun se doosare dhun tak jane mein ek din beet jata tha, which is not acceptable now. Audience no longer have the patience for this. Raag utna hi gayein jab tak usme anurag rahe.

The level of film music has gone down. Music is just being created to mint money,” he says.He even has a piece of advice for the various singing reality shows on television. “To bring out the real talent, more focus should be on raag-based singing.

Visitors wear masks as they look at cars on display at the Auto Expo in Greater Noida

Over the last few years, spotting people in masks has become common in Delhi-NCR. However, that happens outdoors, so it was quite a surprise spotting hundreds of people wearing face masks at the ongoing Auto Expo in Greater Noida . The cause, however, isn't pollution but the coronavirus scare. The mega automobile show sees exhibitors and visitors from across India and a lot of South East Asian countries. Although exhibitors from China – the epicentre of the coronavirus pandemic – are not at the expo this year, visitors are still wary. Raman Awasthi, a Noida student, who came to the expo with his friends, told us, ""All of us bought masks to wear here. There are so many people coming from all over, particularly the countries hit by the virus, that we did not want to take chances. We would have cancelled our visit had we not booked the tickets in advance.""Not just visitors, many working at the expo also admitted that they were nervous. Zumur, who works at the stall of a leading automobile manufacturer, says, ""My father was not too pleased with me coming here because he felt I was walking into the lion's den. I wasn't that perturbed but seeing so many people with masks makes me wonder if I should get one, too, tomorrow."" The 2018 edition of the Auto Expo saw six lakh visitors across the six days and this year, the number is expected to rise.",noida,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74030241,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-166766,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/masks-are-must-carry-accessory-for-visitors-at-auto-expo-this-year/articleshow/74030275.cms

The actor will be packing in a punch with his first action thriller. The movie will be helmed by Om Raut , who made his directorial debut in Bollywood with Tanhaji : The Unsung Warrior, and backed by T-Series. Talking about stepping into a completely new arena, Kartik says, “I have been keen to do an out-and-out action film for a while now, and Bhushan Kumar knew about it. Recently, I watched Tanhaji and was completely blown away, not just by the spectacular visuals, but also the narrative. Om Raut’s vision, when it comes to storytelling using 3D, is amazing. I am excited to be a part of his next and can’t wait to start work on my first action film.”Bhushan Kumar who is keen to make this into a franchise, adds, “Right from SKTKS and PPAW to Bhool Bhulaiyaa 2, it’s been a long, successful association with Kartik. Though he has been successful in the romance and comedy space, he has always wanted to diversify and do an action film.” The producer reveals that like Om’s previous film, this one, too, will be made in 3D, but they will take it notches higher. He explains, “Om’s vision and passion for cinema, which I saw in Tanhaji: The Unsung Warrior, made me want to back his next project as well. The action in that film was in a different zone, while this one will be more on the lines of movies like Dhoom and War. It’s our first film of this kind and will be a fast-paced movie revolving around a heist. The film will be made on a huge scale and will be Kartik’s biggest budget film so far.”The pre-production of the film is underway, and it will go on the floors around August 2020. The remaining cast of the movie, which will be shot in India and at various foreign locations, is yet to be finalised. Om Raut says, “Bhushanji supports my vision completely. In the initial stages of the project itself, I knew that Kartik would fit the character well, and I am glad to have him on board.”",entertainment,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74014608,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-73122/74014608.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/hindi/bollywood/news/kartik-aaryan-gears-up-for-his-first-action-thriller/articleshow/74014593.cms

If you are planning gifts for your better half for Valentine's Day, stay away from the cliches. They will definitely fail to impress your partner and will only make you look brain deadValentine's Day is right around the corner and so is the anxiety of what to get your significant others. But perhaps this year, you might want to do your relationships and yourself a favour by actually putting some thought into the gifts for your Valentines. Instead of gifting the same ghisa pita combo of flowers, teddy bears and chocolates to your girlfriend or boyfriend, maybe 2020 is the year you step away from the whole 'it's the thought that counts' concept. And no, a jar full of personalised messages detailing how much your BF/GF means to you isn't the solution either (even Beyonce said 'crazy in love' and not lazy in love). Love is love and of course, materialistic and expensive gifts aren't always the alternative, but surely some cliches can be discarded. FOREVER! So, to help you stay clear from the cliche trap this Valentine's Day, here’s a few tried, tested and now trashed gift ideas you'd want to stay away from this year and those to come.Just getting a table at one of those'always busy, hours of waiting' restaurants cannot be considered as a feat. What could possibly be so special about dinner on Valentine's Day? A celebrity guest at the table? Unlikely. It's just like any other dinner date, with perhaps a higher bill and a more romantic ambience. Maybe even some nice cutlery. But that's about it. And where exactly are you going to go on a long drive in this city where even flyovers are choked with traffic? You are just going to add to the air pollution. Might as well gift each other the commitment to be more eco-friendly, at least it will present a challenge beyond the Delhi roads. Plus, you'd be doing something for the greater good, so you have that to boast about.Clever or a sure shot way to convey to your significant other that you just can't get a Valentine's gift right? Everyone deserves a decent, if not a grand proposal. But by killing one bird with two stones, you are not only taking away Valentine's Day from them forever but also making sure that every year, they have one less day to celebrate. Unless your pandit ji has told you that it's this day or never, try to make Valentine's Day about celebrating your relationship.The coming years are all about going eco-friendly, so flowers shouldn't even be on your list. They will add to the waste and no matter how beautiful the bouquet, a rose can only do so much in its short lifespan. Whether you swap the roses with the fanciest orchids or the prettiest tulips and lilies, this gift will always have an expiration date.Okay, yes, everyone loves to hear how much they are adored, respected and appreciated, but why should they just get to hear this on Valentine's Day? Do you not feel the same during the rest of the year? This might work on your first Valentine's as a couple, but there's only so much love you can express as time passes. Reserving Valentine's Day to let your significant other know how much they mean to you doesn't just reek of laziness, it's also very basic. And if you were planning on plagiarising or typing these instead of hand-writing them, abort mission now.This is a big no. First of all, even kids have moved beyond soft toys. Second, when was the last time you looked at a stuffed toy and thought 'wow, that's something I need to get for myself'? Exactly. Don't do to others, what you wouldn't do to yourself. Stuffed toys, no matter which species, eventually just become dust collectors, hidden away at some corner of the room. Is that really the symbol of your love?If you simply want to remind your BF/GF about all the fun and romantic moments you have had together, you can definitely do this on any other day. While this one needs more time and patience, the only hard work and thought that goes into this is going through your archives. And while this may be a cute throwback idea (for some), not just your significant other, even your social media followers deserve a better post for Valentine's Day. Even though a video or a customised cup with your pictures on it might seem like a unique/cute idea, this year, let it stay unique in theory and not in reality.",life-style,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74030436,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-274842/74030436.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//life-style/relationships/love-sex/this-valentines-day-give-your-better-half-the-gift-of-not-being-a-cliche/articleshow/74030420.cms
24,['9/02/2020'],"Decentralise Isro powers, set up space regulator &amp; tribunal, says New Space Policy by think tank","This story is from February 9, 2020

NEW DELHI: A new Space Policy 2020 drafted by Takshashila Institution, a think tank and public policy school, proposed decoupling the regulatory and service delivery roles of Indian Space Research Organisation ( Isro ) to create a level-playing field for new entrants.

The policy said the present space ecosystem is centralised around Isro, which is a research organisation, service delivery establishment, regulatory, licensing and compliance agency as well as a disputes settlement body. Therefore, it proposed establishment of an independent Space Regulatory of India (SRAI), which will be responsible for setting standards, licensing space activities and compliance of these activities, and Space Disputes Settlement Appellate Tribunal to adjudicate disputes and settle appeals to protect the interest of service providers.

It also mulled setting up of space PSU Bharat Space Corporation (BSC), which will provide a whole range of space services, directly or through subsidiaries and will be under the ambit of SRAI.

In an interview to TOI, Nitin Pai, co-founder and director of Takshashila, said, “The recommendations were drafted by a task force consisting of myself & Utkarsh Narain from Takshashila, and Siddhey Shinde (Astrome, space technology co) and Yashas Karanam (Bellatrix, space company). They are derived from the outcome of Takshashila’s space policy conclave where a number of experts from the government and private sector came together to discuss the future of the space industry.”

On proposing a regulator and a tribunal, Nitin Pai said, “One of the most basic principles of governance and fair play is that the same entity (Isro) cannot be the player, umpire and rule-maker. So the first step in the opening of any industry sector is the structural separation of these roles: in telecom, we used to have telecom department in the 1980s providing the service, regulating the industry as well as making policy. Today those functions are split between BSNL , TRAI, TDSAT and DoT. The space regulatory authority and dispute settlements tribunals can create a level-playing field for private industry to operate in the space sector. They will be neutral umpires.”

On the fate of Isro’s existing commercial arms Antrix Corporation and NewSpace India Ltd, the Takashashila founder told TOI, “Policy proposed that existing arms will become subsidiaries of the space PSU.” BSC shall explore public-private partnership (PPP) models for building satellites and launch vehicles, etc. This will help drive private capital and solving some capacity constraints, the policy said.

Nitin Pai said, “Even after liberalisation, Isro will have an important role to play. As the national space agency, it will conduct missions like Chandrayaan, Mangalyaan etc that push the frontiers of science, and drive national space exploration. It will also engage in the development of strategic technologies.”

The policy proposed that SRAI, in consultation with the Space Commission, shall come up with a comprehensive framework for licensing and regulation of private human space flights in a year.

The regulations shall delineate safety and technical requirements of the space vehicle, liability and insurance requirements for the company as well as participants.

How do you look back on your journey from Palanpur to US?

From a gaze-and-blink robot to an invisible mouse, from a smart watch to SixthSense, you are credited with many inventions. Which ones are you most proud of and which ones do you use at present?

Why are the Artificial Humans called ‘

’?

So, how different is a NEON from an Alexa?

Some reviews have called the innovation “overhyped”. Your reaction?

How do you react to the commonly expressed fear of AI overriding human intelligence in the future?

What about things like augmented reality and virtual reality? Are these making life easier for people?

You could argue that the world has enough artificial humans as it is but then Pranav Mistry would most likely dismiss it as a terrible joke. The kind of artificial humans that Mistry, president and CEO of Samsung STAR Labs , unveiled at the recent Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas are spelt with capital letters. The 38-year-old computer scientist and inventor talks to Sharmila Ganesan Ram about a future in which humans are humans and machines are humane.I am a small-town boy aiming to change the world we are living in. I could not speak English before I came to the US over 15 years ago. Today, I do not want to be known for the money I make. I am inspired by legends like Michelangelo and Walt Disney. We don’t care how rich they were, what matters is what they gave the world and billions of people — dreams.I would not like to single out any one invention. As I grew up in a small village in India, I used to ask: can we make technology more human? I worked with the India Incubation Centre to make Gujarati keyboards. Also, my exposure to fields like design, technology, art and psychology have given me a very unique perspective of the world. I love to see technology from a design perspective and vice versa. This vision reflects in almost all of my projects and research work as well. In short, I do what I love and I love what I do. I am a ‘Desigineer’. All my work has been about how machines can become more and more like us, rather than we becoming more like machines.The word NEON derives from NEO (new) + humaN. The naming of NEON is also inspired from the properties of Neon as a noble gas . Neon (Ne), the tenth element on the periodic table, is an inert gas that glows orange-red when electrically charged.Unlike AI assistants, NEONs are not an interface to the Internet to ask for weather updates or play your favourite music. Rather, they are more like virtual living beings who can show emotions and learn from experiences. NEONs are more like our friends and companions with whom you share your experiences and build memories. Since NEONs are Artificial Humans that are capable of understanding, conversing and sympathising just like real humans, they can serve as an individualised teacher, a personal financial advisor, a healthcare provider, or a concierge. A NEON can also be an actor, a spokesperson, or a TV anchor.We believe much of the confusion arose since some people thought this was the fully-finished product. At CES 2020, we previewed NEON to the world for the first time. We were showcasing the prowess and capabilities of our CORE R3 engine, and not the fully-finished Artificial Human that will look real and be responsive in real-time.Any new technology generates a lot of fears and concerns too, many of which are genuine and understandable. Here are some ways we hope to address these concerns. First, privacy is at NEON’s core by design. This means, NEON will never share your private data without your permission. Second, the creation of NEON was never about replacing humans, but in fact to make us more human. It is a new medium of expression, compassion, learning and love. NEONs are neither some know-it-all bots nor are they androids, surrogates or copies of real humans. Third, though Artificial Humans’ look may be based on the likeness of a real person, CORE R3 and the technology behind NEON is fundamentally different from deepfake or other facial reanimation techniques. CORE R3 does not manipulate an individual scene, videos or sequences. Instead, it creates unique behaviours and interactions of NEONs in real-time that never happened before. Thus, CORE R3 creates new realities.AR, VR, and many other such new technologies are not making tech easier for people. These are simply providing newer ways to connect to the same data. However, all these technologies are making us more and more disconnected. I grew up with Mickey Mouse as a kid. These cartoon characters are not just in our movies, they are in our dreams too. My daughter, for instance, becomes sad when she sees that Princess Fiona is sad. It’s the human connection that strengthens bonds.",home,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74031873,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1547645,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//home/sunday-times/im-a-desigineer-all-my-work-is-about-how-machines-can-become-more-like-us-says-inventor-pranav-mistry/articleshow/74031844.cms

NEW DELHI: Exit polls on Saturday predicted another big win for AAP in the Delhi assembly elections, with one giving it up to 68 seats in the 70-member house, a figure that would be higher than the 67 it won during its 2015 sweep. None of the polls gave the party less than 44 seats, which would still leave it comfortably placed to form a hat-trick of governments.All polls gave AAP a vote share of over 50%, which if correct, would mean that for the second time running, the party would have won a majority of votes cast. The polls also forecast another wipeout for Congress and in most cases, some improvement in BJP ’s tally, though the magnitude of the increase varied from poll to poll. BJP’s vote share was also projected to increase in each of the polls.If the polls are correct, that would suggest that BJP’s bid to focus on issues like Shaheen Bagh had at best limited success while AAP’s strategy of focusing mainly on the work it had done paid off. Senior BJP functionaries, however, claimed that the exit polls would fail when votes are counted on February 11.The Times Now-IPSOS poll was the most conservative in projecting an AAP victory, giving the party between 44 and 50 seats with a vote share of 52.5%, a slight decline from its 2015 figure of 54.3%. It gave BJP between 20 and 26 seats compared with the three it won in 2015.Even the BJP’s vote share was estimated to rise from 32.8% in 2015 to 39% now. At the other end of the spectrum, the India Today-My Axis poll gave AAP between 59 and 68 seats with a vote share of 56%, which would be even higher than the 2015 figure. This poll saw the BJP finishing with anywhere between two and 11 seats with its vote share up only by a little to 35%.Somewhere between these two polls was the ABP News CVoter poll, which suggested AAP would win between 51 and 65 seats and a vote share of 50.8%. BJP was estimated to end up with anywhere between three and 17 seats with a vote share of 36%. The ABP News poll was one of the few that suggested that the Congress could win seats, projecting a range of one to three seats for the party with a vote share of 8.8%, just a little below the 2015 level.The other two polls mentioned here gave the Congress no seats and vote share in the 5-6% range.

NEW DELHI: Japan is likely to deploy its army to Diamond Princess, a luxury cruise liner that has remained quarantined near Yokohama port for several days and is now the largest known cluster of coronavirus infection outside China, crew members told TOI on Saturday.A total of 138 Indians — 132 staff and six passengers — are among the 3,700 passengers on board the ship which was quarantined after a man who had disembarked in Hong Kong was diagnosed with the novel coronavirus.With two more on board testing positive, the number of confirmed cases has climbed to 63, but none of them are Indians. The army was either being called to “manage” things on the Diamond Princess or for evacuation, a staffer said.The army was either being called to “manage” things on the Diamond Princess or for evacuation, a staffer said, adding, “The army is probably being called to manage things and to ensure safety protocols are followed.” He spoke on the condition of anonymity.The news came even as yet another Indian on board the ship appealed for help on Saturday. A 26-year-old employed as a steward on the ship made a desperate call to his family in Karwar ( Karnataka ), urging them to seek help from the government. “I’m scared as people are being quarantined. Please contact government officials to help us evacuate the ship,” he said in a video call to his father. Carnival Corporation & plc, the company which owns the ship, has assured his parents there was no need to panic and the Indian embassy also emailed a statement to them that it was in constant touch with local Japanese authorities. A majority of Indian crew members on the ship are from Mumbai, Kerala and Goa.On Thursday, another crew member, Binay Kumar Sarkar’s call for help on Facebook had gone viral. He told TOI that it’s all hands on deck now. “We’re all chipping in — in the kitchen, with supplies, cleaning. Then there are always people who have specific requests about their food. We try and do as much as possible,” he said. Sarkar added that ""speaking out of turn"" may not have been prudent. “By talking about our fears, I broke protocol. But this is about the safety of so many people. I don’t know what will happen when I leave this ship, but I had to say something,” he said. Till Friday, he was a chef. As of Saturday, he is a phone operator.But back home in Kolkata, his appeal led to a flurry of activity. West Bengal minister of state for labour, Golam Rabbani, sent a team to his house in North Dinajpur to gather details. His elder brother Shyamal said that their mother was spending sleepless nights. “The longer he is on the ship, the higher his chances of catching the infection. We are worried,"" he told TOI.While there is a definite end in sight — February 19 — when the quarantine period ends and they can disembark, people on board are worried. “This quarantine protocol, by putting potential carriers together, is what is worrying me. Why should we be on the ship when we know it is an infected zone?” said an Indian chef who hails from Jammu. “Japan has all the resources. Why has it docked us here?”For those on board, waiting is the only option. “No one is allowed to step out. Two days ago, people were allowed to come out for fresh air and stand a metre apart from each other. But that’s about it,” said Sarkar. Anyone with a temperature higher than 37.5°C has to be “taken away”. Medicines and masks are in good supply though.""Water and food is now free of cost, as is the internet.

NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi said the Tamil issue was discussed with an open mind with his Sri Lankan counterpart Mahinda Rajapaksa , who is on his first visit outside the island nation after assuming office.

Security and counter-terrorism dominated talks between India and Sri Lanka, as the Modi government hosted Rajapaksa even as India also asked Sri Lanka to expedite reconciliation process for the Tamils in the north and northeast of the island. The emphasis was significant given India's stake in the welfare of the Tamil population, which has shared ethnic bonds across the Palk Strait in Tamil Nadu.

In his statement to the media, Modi said, ""I am confident that the Government of Sri Lanka will realise the expectations of the Tamil people for equality, justice, peace and respect within a united Sri Lanka.""

In his statement to the media, Modi said, ""I am confident that the Government of Sri Lanka will realise the expectations of the Tamil people for equality, justice, peace and respect within a united Sri Lanka. For this, it will be necessary to carry forward the process of reconciliation with the implementation of the 13th amendment to the Constitution of Sri Lanka.""

The two sides held delegation-level talks, restricted talks (with external affairs minister S Jaishankar and NSA Ajit Doval ) and a one-on-one conversation between Modi and Rajapaksa on Saturday.

34,['9/02/2020'],"SC: States not bound to give quotas in jobs, promotions","This story is from February 9, 2020

NEW DELHI: Busting a constitutional myth about reservation being intrinsic to public employment, the Supreme Court has ruled that states are not bound to provide quotas for SCs, STs or OBCs in government jobs and that there is no fundamental right to claim reservation in promotion.

“There is no doubt that the state government is not bound to make reservations. There is no fundamental right which inheres in an individual to claim reservation in promotions. No mandamus can be issued by the court directing the state government to provide reservations,” said a bench of Justices L Nageswara Rao and Hemant Gupta on Friday.

The ruling came in a case regarding the validity of the Uttarakhand government’s September 5, 2012 decision to fill up all posts in government services in the state without providing reservations to Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes. The Uttarakhand HC had struck down the notification and had directed the government to provide quota to the specified categories.

Uttarakhand’s legal team argued that Article 16(4) and 16 (4-A) of the Constitution are merely enabling provisions and there is no fundamental right to claim reservation. The SC agreed the articles empower the state to make reservation in jobs and promotion in favour of SCs and STs “if in the opinion of the state they are not adequately represented”.

The bench upheld the September 5 notification and reversed the HC judgement. Writing the judgement for the bench, Justice Rao said, “It is settled law that the state government cannot be directed to provide reservations for appointments in public posts. Similarly, the state is not bound to make reservation for SCs and STs in matters of promotions. However, if they (the states) wish to exercise their discretion and make such a provision, the state has to collect quantifiable data showing inadequacy of representation of that class in public services.”

It also faulted the HC direction to the state to collect quantifiable data for providing reservation in promotion.

The SC said, “Not being bound to provide reservations, the state is not required to justify its decision... Even if under-representation of SCs and STs is brought to the notice of the Supreme Court, no mandamus can be issued by this court to the state government to provide reservation.”

Senior advocates Ranjit Kumar, Mukul Rohatgi and P S Narasimha, appearing for Uttarakhand, had argued there is no fundamental right to claim reservation in appointments or promotions to public posts and that there was no constitutional duty on states to provide reservations.

Appearing for people seeking quota in promotion, senior advocates Kapil Sibal , Dushyant Dave and Colin Gonsalves argued that states had a constitutional obligation to provide reservation for upliftment of members of SC and ST communities as mandated under Articles 16(4) and 16(4-A). Justices Rao and Gupta said, “It is for the state government to decide whether reservations are required in the matter of appointment and promotions to public posts.”

The bench said when a state forms an opinion that reservation is not required to be provided, all that is needed is that there must be some material to support its decision.

“The court should show due deference to the opinion of the state which does not, however, mean that that the opinion so formed is beyond judicial scrutiny altogether,” it said.

NEW DELHI: Better roads connecting major cities and more availability of luxury buses seem to have impacted the railways’ revenue.

The number of passengers travelling in AC chair car and executive class, meant primarily for inter-city travel on trains such as Shatabdi and Tejas, is estimated to decrease from nearly 35 million passengers in 2018-19 to about 33.8 million during the current fiscal ending March.

On the other hand, the number of passengers travelling AC 1, 2 and 3 is estimated to increase during this period. While the railways has projected a minor increase in the number of passengers in the AC first class, rise in the number of passengers is estimated to be significantly higher in the other two classes.

According to the Budget document, during 2018-19, nearly 138 million passengers travelled in AC-1, 2 and 3 compartments; the corresponding figure for this fiscal is estimated to be just over 143 million. The ministry has projected this cumulative number will increase to about 144 million passengers during 2020-21.

Though the railways has projected moderate increase in the number of passengers travelling in executive class and AC chair car for the next financial year — 35.3 million — officials said achieving that would be a tough task. “This is because now better roads and high quality bus service between cities like Delhi-Jaipur, Delhi-Chandigarh, Delhi-Lucknow and Pune-Mumbai have emerged as perfect alternative for people. It’s a challenge for us how to bring back passengers for this segment. Increase in number of passengers in AC-1 and 2 is an indicator that people prefer a more relaxed journey,” said a railway official.

He cited how the railways has now offered a Humsafar Express , which is a fully premium service with AC-3 tier and 3-tier sleeper class accommodation with modern facilities, to IRCTC to run between Varanasi and Indore under its initiative to give 150 trains to “private players” to run them. Till now it has given two Tejas trains with only seating facility to IRCTC, which operate on Delhi-Lucknow and Ahmedabad-Mumbai routes.

According to the Budget documents, the railways has targeted to increase the earnings from passenger segment to Rs 61,000 crore in 2020-21 as compared to Rs 56,000 crore during this fiscal. Nearly Rs 2,000 crore of this increase will come from hike in fare. It has projected freight earnings at Rs 1.47 lakh crore for 2020-21 as compared to Rs 1.43 lakh crore during this fiscal.

Representative image

NEW DELHI: Drug-makers trying to circumvent price control will face stringent regulatory action and penalty with the drug price regulator revising its guidelines to monitor overpricing.

The National Pharmaceutical Pricing Authority is considering a proposal to bring under the scanner cases where firms are not following pricing norms and refusing to submit data related to production and pricing or responding to showcause notices.

Such defaulters will be issued notice and their cases will be referred to the collector for recovering the overcharged amount along with a penalty, an official source said.

The proposal suggesting changes in the overcharging guidelines was taken up at a recent meeting of NPPA and it was decided to incorporate necessary changes in the guidelines, he said.

The move comes in the wake of many pharmaceutical companies not submitting data – especially verified data— or not responding to showcause notices issued by the regulator while pricing their products at prices determined on their own. The regulator has recently examined over 200 cases and found such aberrations. NPPA has also asked to validate data submitted by the companies with reference to excise or GST records and returns filed by the company under the statutes.

Currently, cases of overcharging beyond a particular amount are automatically referred to district collectors/magistrates administering the region where the defaulting company has assets. The district authority then recovers the amount as land revenue arrears.

The existing guidelines mandate companies to submit detailed information and data about their manufacturing as well as pricing.

The Drugs Price Control Order (DPCO) empowers the regulator to recover from the company any amount accrued due to charging of prices higher than those fixed or notified by the government.

Apart from the overcharged amount, the regulator also imposes an interest as penalty from the date of overcharging. Contravention of provisions of the DPCO is also punishable in accordance with provisions of the Essential Commodities Act, 1955.

Pune: The civic body added Rs1.4 crore to its coffers after amicably solving 456 cases of legal dispute pertaining to municipal properties, property tax and water charge defaults, among others, in the Lok Adalat on Saturday.

Civic officials said the PMC was trying out such an initiative for the second time in the last two months. The first such initiative was in December 2019.

As per the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) records, 409 cases of the water department were resolved in the drive where the recovery amounted to Rs1.33 crore and the 47 other cases pertaining to the establishment department raked in Rs7 lakh in this drive.

""The initiative has received a good response from citizens after notices were issued in this regard,"" said Manjusha Idhate, a senior official of PMC's legal department.

The civic officials said the administration was focused on recovery of tax dues and pending rents of properties, such as shops, public parking places and residential properties, under its jurisdiction.

“It is tough to recover all the dues with issues like manpower crunch which make recovery hard. It has led to long pending dues as many defaulters have not paid tax in decades,” said a senior PMC official.

He said even if some issues were of a personal nature, but they were indirectly impacting the revenue collection of the PMC. Family disputes over property ownership were leading to delays in payment of property tax. A few such problems were addressed in the Lok Adalat on Saturday.

As per the National Legal Services Authority, Lok Adalat is an alternative dispute redressal mechanism, it is a forum where disputes/cases pending in the court of law or at pre-litigation stage are settled/compromised amicably. It has got statutory status under the Legal Services Authorities Act, 1987. Under the said Act, the award (decision) made by the Lok Adalats is deemed to be a decree of a civil court and is final and binding on all parties and no appeal against such an award lies before any court of law. There is no court fee payable when a matter is filed in a Lok Adalat.

PATNA: Police arrested Sujit Kumar, owner of Shivam Jewellers at Jai Ram Bazaar in Khagaul for cooking up a story of jewellery loot worth Rs60-70 lakh from his shop on February 4 to claim insurance money.

Patna SSP Upendra Kumar Sharma said on Saturday that Sujit had concocted the robbery story to claim insurance amount of Rs60-70 lakh. Upendra said Sujit himself cut the wires of CCTV cameras and dumped the wires into the garbage. “At that time there was only 50 grams of gold and silver jewellery in his shop, which is still there. Later, he called the police and alleged that jewellery worth Rs60-70 lakh were stolen from his shop,” he said.

“After three consecutive days of intensive investigation, the police did not find any evidence related to the robbery. Later, we also checked several footages of the CCTV cameras installed in the vicinity, but could not see anyone entering the shop during the period mentioned by him,” he said.

The SSP said Khagaul police got to know from reliable sources that Sujit had taken huge loan and couldn’t repay the debt. “When the police quizzed him, he kept changing his statement about the robbery. After the police showed the evidence, the shopowner accepted that he faked the jewellery loot story,” Upendra said.

A case under Sections 420 (cheating), 466 (forgery) and 468 (forgery for purpose of cheating) of IPC has been lodged against the jeweller.

Jitendra lies injured after the encounter on Saturday

LUCKNOW: Less than a week after Hindutva leader Ranjeet Bachchan was shot dead in the heart of the city, the gunman who pumped a bullet in his forehead was arrested after a brief encounter, minutes after midnight on Friday.

Police said, the shooter, Jitendra , 28, had come to collect cash from a relative’s house at Charbagh before fleeing to Nepal. A .32 bore pistol was seized from his possession, which was also the murder weapon. Bachchan was shot outside Globe Park in Hazratganj area on February 2, while he was out on a morning walk.

Jitendra’s name surfaced as an accused after masterminds — Bachchan’s second wife Smriti Srivastava , Smriti’s paramour Deependra Srivastava and the latter’s driver Sanjeet Gautam were nabbed on Thursday. Jitendra, who carried a cash reward of Rs 75,000 on his head, was Deependra’s cousin. He worked as a contractor in Mumbai and later shifted to Lucknow after his business floundered. Jitendra owed an obligation to Deependra as his stay in the city was sponsored by him, said police.

Lucknow police commissioner Sujeet Pandey told TOI five teams were tasked with tracking down Jitendra after he was caught on CCTV camera, stalking Ranjeet during his morning walk in Hazratganj on the fateful day. “Police teams began tracing his whereabouts after arrest of key plotters provided vital clues. Cops swooped down on Jitendra’s residence and enquired about his relatives and friends,” said Pandey.

Local intelligence unit along with police teams were asked to keep vigil on his relatives. On Friday night, Jitendra came to meet a relative in Charbagh and police teams were pressed into action. SHO Hazratganj, Dheerendra Kushwaha, said, “We laid a trap on Lucknow-Kanpur Road. Around 12.30 am, accused Jitendra was tracked riding a bike with a Rae Bareli registration number near a check-point. When he was told to show registration papers, Jitendra opened fire. Then he pressed on the gas and veered towards Jail Road.

Another police team led by station house officer, Alambagh, Anand Shahi intercepted Jitendra and ordered him to surrender, but he again whipped out his gun and opened fire. The cop shot him in the leg and Jitendra fell off the bike. Police said his relative in Charbagh told police that Jitendra wanted money before fleeing to Nepal.

PATNA: More than 15,000 plants of different varieties were sold at the two-day flower exhibition-cum-competition, which concluded at Gyan Bhawan on Saturday. Several rare and exotic plants were also displayed at the event organised by the state agriculture department.

As many as 140 florists , who took part in the competition, were felicitated on the occasion. Pavan Kumar Sarraf from Bhagalpur received the first prize.

Speaking at the event, agriculture department secretary N Saravana Kumar said, “The purpose of organizing this exhibition was to promote commercial production of flowers in the state. There is a huge gap between the production and consumption of flowers here.”

Meanwhile, florists claimed that visitors mostly bought hibiscuses and roses from them. Shambhu Kumar Chaurasia, the owner of a nursery in Vaishali , told this newspaper, “Earlier, nature lovers planted flowers and trees. Now, they have become a necessity.”

Several stalls at the exhibition also displayed floral pots. Indrajeet Kumar, a nursery owner from Patna, said, “I have colourful, brown, hanging and double-hanging pots. A lot of people purchased the colourful ones.”

Over 50,000 people reportedly thronged the two-day exhibition. Astha Shrivastava, who bought shrubs and exotic plants, said, “The exhibition has a huge range of plants. More such events should be organised.”

PATNA: Continuing with its new strategy to accommodate people from other sections than its traditional base among Muslims and Yadavs, RJD state president Jagdanand Singh said on Saturday that 27% quota for extremely backward caste (EBC) and 18% for the Dalit candidates will be maintained in the distribution of tickets for the upcoming state assembly elections as well.

Addressing mediapersons after a meeting of RJD’s legislators at 10, Circular Road here on Saturday, Jagdanand said, “Our party believes in social justice and expansion of RJD was done on similar lines. All legislators are happy with the reservation given in the election of party district presidents.”

Singh said the RJD legislators have been asked to guide the new district presidents and work in coordination with them for the assembly elections slated to be held later this year.

Leader of opposition in the state assembly Tejashwi Prasad Yadav asked the legislators to give their best for better results in the upcoming elections. The legislators were also handed over the booth-level data related to party’s performance in previous elections. However, Lalu’s elder son Tej Pratap Yadav was not present in the more than three hours’ long meeting.

Party insiders said discussions were also held on action to be taken against rebel leaders and their anti-party activities. “It was discussed in the meeting that the party high command will soon initiate some action against its MLAs like Prema Choudhary, Maheshwar Yadav and Faraz Fatmi for their anti-party activities,” an RJD legislator said.

RJD has called another meeting of its newly elected district presidents and district principal secretary general on Sunday to announce the names of its state committee members.

43,['9/02/2020'],Kerala govt promises pay revision before end of term,"This story is from February 9, 2020

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: One of the pages which finance minister Thomas Isaac didn ’t read out during his marathon budget speech on Friday contained an important announcement that would have brought more cheers for the ruling front. The paragraph 198 of the budget speech promised government employees that the 11th pay commission recommendations would be implemented in the coming fiscal.

“DA arrears will be disbursed in a phased manner in the next financial year. The practice of government directly paying house building advance for government employees will be brought back,” Isaac said in that paragraph.

The state government in November last year constituted the 11th pay commission, in accordance with the practice of revising the salary and perks of government employees every five years. Though the 10th pay commission headed by Justice C N Ramachandran Nair had recommended that pay revision was required only once in 10 years, the LDF government rejected that proposal.

It is learnt that the plan of the government is to get the report of the 11th commission soon and announce implementation by January 2021 before model code of conduct for assembly polls would be issued. The last-minute announcement, expect LDF leaders, will help the front generously at the time of election.

The 11th commission – led by retired bureaucrat K Mohandas and comprising economist M K Sukumaran Nair and legal expert Ashok Mammen Cherian – has been asked to complete the task by mid-May. With the volume of work that comes under the terms of reference, the deadline is unlikely to realise. The government is also prepared to give a three months’ extension and hopes to conclude post-report consultations before the end of 2020.

File photo used for representational purpose

PATNA: Despite last year’s hullabaloo over alleged discrimination in preparation of electors list , the number of third gender voters has reduced in the state, authoritative sources in the office of chief electoral officer (CEO) of Bihar said on Saturday.

According to the updated draft of electoral rolls released by the Election Commission on Friday, there are only 2,344 transgender voters eligible to exercise their franchise in the state assembly election due in October-November this year.

The EC data showed a decrease of 62 third gender votes in the state from 2406 registered before the 2019 Lok Sabha election. On the contrary, altogether 15,35,767 new voters have been included in electoral rolls of 243 assembly constituencies in the state.

According to Reshma Prasad, a transgender and founder of Dostana Safar, there were around 40,000 transgenders in the voting age in Bihar, but only 2406 were enrolled in 2019 as third gender votes as the remaining were either enrolled as male or female.

Prasad, who is a postgraduate from Patna University, said they had voiced their anger over discrimination in electoral rolls last year and authorities had assured them to rectify the errors. “But going by the updated draft, there seems to be no change. Rather the number has decreased,” she said.

Prasad said they would approach the EC. “Gender bias is not a new phenomenon in Bihar,” she said, adding that many from the community were reluctant to get their names included in the voter list. She, however, attributed lack of information and reluctance as main reasons behind decline in the number of registered third gender voters in the state. “But people’s perception about third gender is changing since the Supreme Court’s verdict before the 2014-Lok Sabha polls,” she added.

The updated draft of electoral rolls showed that of the total 7,18,22,450 electors, 3,79,12,127 are males, 3,39,07,979 females and 2,344 third gender voters in the state. Of them, 7,14,988 voters are in the age group of 18-19 years while 13,03,543 are in the age group of above 80 years. Besides, there are 1,58,094 service voters and 72 overseas electors. However, the names of 2,94,969 voters were deleted from the electoral rolls due to duplicity, death or transfer.

CEO (Bihar) H R Srinivasa told the media on the sidelines of release of the updated draft of electors list that the elector population (EP) ratio has increased from 0.495 to 0.504 in the state. Similarly, population gender has increased from 892 to 894, he added.

He attributed the reason for the rise in the number of electors to sustained campaign launched by the EC and special campaign days observed on January 5 and January 12. There are 72,723 polling booths spread over 243 assembly constituencies in the state.

PATNA/GAYA: In a bid to prevent the spread of novel coronavirus (nCoV), the state health department and medical experts are keeping tabs on the people returning from China.

A youth from Bodh Gaya , who came back from China in January, was admitted to the isolation ward of the Anugrah Narayan Magadh Medical College and Hospital (ANMMCH) on Friday as a precautionary measure.

Gaya district magistrate Abhishek Singh told this newspaper on Saturday that the youth was kept in the isolation ward, but there was nothing to worry about. “In this case, the incubation period for the CoV is over. Extra precaution is only being exercised to rule out any possibility of its spread,” he claimed.

Gaya civil surgeon Dr B K Singh said, “All tests as per the medical protocol have been conducted and the reports are awaited. Once they are available, action will be taken accordingly.”

Meanwhile, samples of four more people from other parts of the state, which were suspected to be affected by nCoV, were sent to the National Institute of Virology. While two of them — from Saran and West Champaran — were negative, the reports of two others from Supaul and Bhagalpur are still awaited.

According to sources, several teams of health officials, comprising 7,990 doctors and health workers, are screening people in all seven districts along the India-Nepal border and other places across the state.

“Altogether 381 camps have been set up in border areas and 4,119 passengers screened at the Gaya airport so far,” said state surveillance officer Dr Ragini Mishra.

Asked about the precautions being exercised by doctors and paramedical staff engaged in the screening exercise at the Gaya airport, Dr B K Singh pointed out that biological masks had been provided to all the staff engaged in screening work. “They have also been directed to wash their hands regularly and use sanitisers,” he said.

With the growing risk of CoV outbreak, orientation programmes are also being organised in schools. “As many as 509 orientation programmes have been conducted to create awareness about the CoV at different schools in small districts and villages. Regular gram sabha meetings are also being held across the state,” said Mishra.

46,['9/02/2020'],400 blocks to get automatic weather stations in 2 years,"This story is from February 9, 2020

PATNA: The state government has targeted to develop automatic weather stations (AWS) in every panchayat of the state in the next two years.

State planning and development minister Maheshwar Hazari told TOI on Saturday, “The stations, which will come up at a cost of Rs 180 crore, will give a 72-hour forecast and early warning to farmers about extreme weather conditions like floods and droughts through a mobile application. It will also provide information about maximum and minimum temperatures, humidity, wind speed and pressure.”

The minister added, “Our target is to install the AWS in 400 blocks first and later in every panchayat. Bidding process was conducted recently, but no firm qualified. Now, fresh tenders will be floated to invite bids from the interested firms.”

Apart from AWS, the government has also decided to install automatic rain gauge system (ARGS) for measuring and monitoring rainfall in every panchayat.

“Farmers will be connected to the AWS and the ARGS through an app and get timely information about the weather so that they can work accordingly,” Hazari said.

The minister also claimed that work was underway on development of the Bihar Weather Service Centre for issuing forecast and analysis based on the information received from panchayat-level AWS and ARGS.

At present, weather forecast in Bihar is mostly issued by the Patna branch of the India Meteorological Department. Agrometeorological bulletins, on the other hand, are issued by Dr Rajendra Prasad Central Agricultural University (RPCAU) at Pusa in Samastipur.

Assistant professor of agrometeorology in RPCAU, Abdus Sattar, hailed the government’s decision as “it will help develop a good advisory system for the farming community”.

“It is difficult for agricultural scientists and officials to analyse weather parameters across the state and issue agro-advisories accordingly because there are few data retrieving centres in Bihar. The AWS and the ARGS will ensure better planning in agriculture, pest and disease control in crops as well as water management,” Sattar said.

The government has also signed a memorandum of understanding with Skymet, a private weather monitoring agency. When it comes to disaster preparedness, the state water resources department now relies on the data shared by the agency on rainfall forecast and inclement weather alerts.

PATNA: Five unions of power companies under the umbrella of Vidyut Kamgar Padhadhikari Abhiyanta Sanyukt Sangharsh Morcha has announced a ‘symbolic’ 24-hour strike on February 11 and 12.

The strike has been called against the rumoured privatization of Bihar State Power Holding Company Limited (BSPHCL) as well as its subsidiary companies.

Power Engineering Service Association’s general secretary Surendra Kumar on Saturday said all the engineers, technical staff, accountants, electricians and other employees of BSPHCL subsidiary companies would join the strike, despite the warning of departmental action under the Essential Service Maintenance Regulation (ESMR), 2020.

Addressing the media here on Saturday, Surendra said the association members would not take the responsibility if the energy department failed to make alternative arrangements for the 24-hour shutdown called by them. “We have already submitted a letter to the BSPHCL CMD-cum-principal secretary of energy department Pratyaya Amrit about the strike. He will be responsible for the inconvenience caused to common people,” he said.

“We have also submitted a charter of demands which include no privatization of power companies in state, removal of CMD and revoking the fake cases against electricity employees who protested on January 27 outside the Vidyut Bhawan among others,” he said.

Upendra Choudhary of Junior Engineering Service Association said they tried to approach the CMD but he was not ready to talk. “We need a written confirmation from the minister and the principal secretary that no privatization will take place, but they are only giving verbal assurances,” he said.

Kolkata: Four days since the death of Tangra’s Christopher Road resident Gopal Pramanick, 52, the police have begun recording statements of independent witnesses who were on the road that night, including drivers of a few vehicles that crossed the spot within two minutes of the incident.

Most of them, sources claimed, have clarified that they had not seen how or what led to the accident. Most of them reacted after the ambulance hit the victim and fled.

Priyanka Pramanick, 28, though, claimed her father-in-law Gopal was killed when he tried to protest against an attempt to kidnap her. Her family said they might seek the court’s intervention in this matter.

“We spoke to Rabinath Gure, a meat supplier who came forward as a witness. His statement is being videographed. He saw the accident and people running after the ambulance. We ensured his statement is detailed,” said an officer.

A crucial CCTV footage in this case runs for 1 minute and 14 seconds. The accident takes place between 55 and 59 seconds and, by the 60th second, the ambulance is visible with the family members running behind it. “How is it that everything took place in 10-15 seconds? How can someone stop, converse and then pick up speed that can kill a person by dragging him along?” questioned an officer.

EDITED

Jaipur: The Union Jal Shakti ministry will assist Rajasthan in developing its state-specific Integrated Water and Crop Information and Management system (IWCIMS) on pilot basis.

The state-specific system will enable the state to have a repository of satellite images of the ground and surface water bodies, role of artificial intelligence in managing water resources, scientific management of dams and creating buffer zones to meet drought-like situations. It will be done with the help of central agencies like Isro, CAZRI in Jodhpur to name a few.

The state has submitted a proposal to create its own data system which was approved by the Centre on a pilot basis. The success of the state will further open gates for other states to create their own systems. Naveen Mahajan, secretary, water resources and command area development, said, “For a water-scarce state like Rajasthan, it is imperative that water as a resource is scientifically managed and optimally used for agriculture. This integrated approach is the need of the hour and it will go a long way in injecting sustainability in handling water resources.”

This data will help in suggesting farmers the crop pattern and provide them with the irrigation facilities increasing the productivity and income.

The data will be collected under the following modules — reservoir management, water security plan, block-level crop planning, smart grid water transfer, drought management, pollution and water quality and village water budgeting.

“At a macro level, while we will be comprehensively dealing with dam and irrigation mechanism management, what is more important is the grassroot-level relevance of this project. It will be a direct benefit to the villagers to plan their cropping patterns for the coming season based on the scientifically accumulated data like soil moisture and water availability. The data will be available online and will give sustainable impetus to the agrarian economy of the state,” Mahajan said.

It is expected that the system will be developed in two years. It will also include decision support system (DSS), automation of data processing in coherence with satellite imagerie, real-time data acquisition and processing using artificial intelligence (AI).

KOLKATA: An engineer from Thakurpukur has taken to Facebook to recount how a section of daily passengers — aged between 50 and 55 who travel in a government bus — harassed his 62-year-old mother last Friday over a seat, reducing her to tears and forcing her to call up her son and seek police intervention midway into her trip.

The cops , however, reacted in time. While the senior citizen kept receiving calls from police, forcing one of the harassers to cut his journey short, a big team stopped the bus at Kidderpore, got the woman and the accused off it and took them to Watgunge police station.

Even though the cops made a general diary, the woman refused to register an FIR. “We have counselled the accused and warned them of severe action if another complaint is made against them,” said an officer.

“Around 10.45am, I got a call from my mother that some men on the bus were harassing her. She was crying and asked me to inform Kolkata Police. I immediately called the Kolkata Police Women ’s Helpline (1091) and an officer heard me out patiently before asking for my mother’s number, name and the approximate location of the bus,” the engineer wrote on Facebook.

“The officer then called my mother and noted down the details. My mother then started receiving calls from Lalbazar, Watgunge police and Hastings police, and within 25 minutes, cops stopped the bus in Kidderpore,” he added.

“I am thankful to the police and am reassured that they keep women’s safety at the top of their list,” he concluded.

PATNA: An ASI named Lalu Yadav and a constable were among three people arrested while boozing in a khatal (cow shed) near Patliputra police station in the state capital late on Friday night. Lalu, constable Pawan Kumar and khatal owner Nagendra Kumar were sent to jail on Saturday. Breathalyser test confirmed that they had consumed alcohol.

Patliputra police station SHO Kameshwar Prasad Singh said Lalu and Pawan were posted at Shastri Nagar police station in the state capital. Nagendra is stated to be a close relative of one of the two policemen. “Three glasses full of liquor were seized from the spot,” he added.

The cops manning the Patliputra police station were alerted about the boozing by the trio around 11pm. “The khatal has virtually turned into a boozing centre. People frequented the khatal late in the night for that purpose. The local police were in the know of things but they preferred to keep mum for the reason best known to them,” said a retired IAS officer, preferring anonymity.

When contacted, DSP (law & order) Swarn Prabhat said, “The three were arrested for violating the provisions of Bihar Excise and Prohibition Act 2016. They were found drunk late Friday night.”

Lalu, who was working as ‘munshi’ at the Shastri Nagar police station, however, defended himself and told media persons that the cops engaged in the raid were demanding huge money for releasing them from the spot.

DSP Prabhat said he has recommended disciplinary action against the two arrested cops to the SSP.

Bihar deputy CM Sushil Kumar Modi

PATNA: Referring to the anti-CAA, NRC and NPR campaign launched by former JNUSU president and CPI central committee member Kanhaiya Kumar and other like-minded groups in the state, deputy CM Sushil Kumar Modi (SuMo) on Saturday flung the ‘kapda (cloth)’ jibe at the people turning up at the rallies addressed by them.

Earlier, PM Narendra Modi had also made the same kind of ‘cloth’ jibe at those involved in protesting against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), National Register for Citizens (NRC) and National Population Register (NPR) in West Bengal .

“These days some Naxal and Leftist people have been holding rallies and meetings in different parts of the state. Who all are turning up at their rallies — you can recognize them by looking at the clothes they wear,” SuMo said, without taking the name of Kanhaiya, who has been on a statewide yatra since January 30 against CAA/NPR/NRC.

SuMo was addressing a function organized by the SC/ST Morcha of the state BJP to celebrate the birth anniversary of Sant Ravidas at the party’s state headquarters. Among others who also addressed the function were the party’s state chief Sanjay Kumar Jaiswal, ministers Nand Kishore Yadav, Prem Kumar and Mangal Pandey.

SuMo also said the same people have been trying to forge Dalit-Muslim alliance in the state on the issues of CAA, NRC and NPR, but it would not succeed, like it did not succeed when the British colonial rulers had tried to do the same in the country. He added that the Dalits have been the part of Hindu society and would continue to remain with it.

Pointing to the need to introduce CAA in the country, SuMo said it has been brought in to give protection to non-Muslim persons by giving them citizenship in India, if they came having suffered religious persecution in Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan. He also said Dalits coming from the three countries were the biggest beneficiaries of it.

SuMo also reminded Dalit sections of the ‘Lalu-Rabri rule’ and said Dalits felt most insecure as they faced massacres when they used to be made to fall in line in their villages and would be gunned down. However, the NDA government gave reservation to Dalits in the panchayati raj institutions and also appointed them as Vikas Mitras.

LJP national president Chirag Paswan with party state president Prince Raj and others talking to journalists a... Read More

PATNA: Lok Janshakti Party (LJP) national president and Jamui MP Chirag Paswan on Saturday said he would embark on the statewide ‘yatra’ from February 21 and address a rally in every district culminating in a state-level rally at Gandhi Maidan on the birth anniversary of B R Ambedkar on April 14.

Stating that the theme of his yatra and political campaign would be “Bihar first, Bihari first,” Chirag said the Nitish Kumar government has done many developmental works and scripted turnaround stories about the state, “but time has come to move beyond them”. He also said a committee would be constituted to prepare the ‘vision document’, which would have inputs from him, the party and other LJP leaders.

Talking to media after the LJP’s state committee meeting here, Chirag refused to make any claim as to the number of assembly seats his party would like to contest in the assembly elections later this year, maintaining that the NDA partners would first reach at a formula for seat sharing.

He, however, said the LJP has been making preparations on the 119 assembly seats at which the NDA partners do not have their sitting MLAs and the panels of the party’s potential candidates would be prepared by the state parliamentary board with respect to them for consideration by the central parliamentary board, so that the party could “zero in on the seats that could go to its kitty.”

At the state committee meeting, the names of the extended committee were also announced, besides taking decisions with regard to gearing up for the poll preparation exercise. State LJP president Prince Raj and the party’s campaign committee chairman cum MLA Raju Tiwari accompanied Chirag.

The standing criteria for the shortlisting and final selection of the potential candidates are two-fold — that they would have to make 25,000 members in each of their constituency concerned and also constitute the booth-level committees.

The state assembly elections are due in October-November this year, but quality difference has come in the NDA in terms of its present coalition partners compared to the 2015 assembly elections. While the Rashtriya Lok Samata Party (RLSP) led by Upendra Kushwaha and Hindustani Awam Morcha (Secular) headed by Jitan Ram Manjhi are out of the NDA, the JD(U) joined it in July 2017. Incidentally, during the parliamentary elections last year, the BJP and JD(U) shared the 40 parliamentary seats, keeping 17 seats each on the 50:50 formula, leaving the six seats for the LJP.

Surat: Next time , you purchase two-wheelers or cars and are forced to take vehicle insurance by auto dealers from them, then you can complain to regional transport office (RTO) about the issue.

RTO has instructed all automobile dealers to not force their customers to take vehicle insurance from them. Official sources said state transport commissioner has issued orders to RTOs to take action against such auto dealers.

DK Chavda, regional transport officer, said, “We have issued notices to all automobile dealers across the city and district to not force vehicle owners to take vehicle insurance from them. It will be treated as malpractice. In case of complaint by vehicle owners, there is a legal provision to suspend registration of dealers for three months. We have not received any complaint from vehicle owners against the dealers. We want people to be aware of their rights and choose insurance companies that offer best rates.”

Sources said automobile dealers provide a complete package to their customers purchasing two-wheelers and cars, which includes price of vehicle, vehicle tax, insurance, RTO charges and HSRPs. The customers can’t choose insurance companies on their own.

Raju Shah, vice-chairman of road safety committee, a non-government organization, told TOI, “Automobile dealers earn commission from insurance companies and they also charge extra bucks for HSRPs. Customers normally give in to the demand of the dealers. In the past, we had organized many events in the city to spread awareness among people about these corrupt practices by some dealers.”

Surat: Defying the Bharat Diamond Bourse’s (BDB) ban on the trading of lab-grown diamonds, Surat has an underground market flourishing in Varachha and Mahidharpura. Here, diamond merchants deal ‘under the table’ in artificial diamonds with their fixed clients from Mumbai and Delhi.

Hub of diamond polishing, Surat’s lab-grown diamond market has more than 500 units manufacturing Rs 5,000 crore worth of diamonds per annum.

“You won’t find these merchants openly dealing in lab-grown diamonds, as they would do with real diamonds in the diamond streets. There are many who are doing brisk business with artificial stones,” said a merchant in Mahidhapura on condition of anonymity.

He further said that he has been trading in real diamonds for the past 17 years. However, looking at the artificials’ lucrative market, he too started dealing in synthetic diamonds for the last few months. He has his buyers based in Mumbai and Delhi. “I procure goods from the local units and sell them to the buyers with good profit margin,” he added.

Decreasing profit from worldwide dip in demand for real diamonds has forced many diamantaires to secretly deal in the lab-grown diamonds. The attraction towards the lab-grown diamond business in India is mainly due to the rising demands in the international markets including the US and the UAE, besides higher profit margin. Though these are almost 50% cheaper to the real diamonds, the export of lab-grown diamonds is increasing from India.

Going by Gems and Jewellery Export Promotion Council (GJEPC) data, India’s export of lab-grown diamonds has increased by 107% between April and December 2019 at Rs 2,200 crore.

But industry experts rue that there is no governing body in the country, mainly in Mumbai or Surat markets, to check illicit trading of lab-grown diamonds. Diamond merchants carry the illegal business in their own individual capacity, a source said.

Box

What adds to the fake sparkle

Market estimates claim about Rs 50 crore worth of lab-grown diamonds are traded in Surat every month

Profit margins in these deals range between 5 and 6% on the total value of the goods, much higher than real diamonds

Lab-grown diamonds are 50% cheaper than the natural diamonds and used in bling and fashion jewellery

Surat diamond market does not come under Mumbai-based BDB’s purview and so there is no supervision

Also, the diamond markets in Varachha and Mahidhapura are decentralized and unorganized

There is no punishment as such for diamond merchant caught selling artificial diamonds

Quotes

“Both the diamond markets are unorganized and there are no rules as such for the lab-grown diamonds. There are many who deal in lab-grown diamonds with limited customers. We want complete disclosure of the diamonds on the part of the merchants”

Babu Kathiriya, president, Surat Diamond Association

“There is no fear of undisclosed mixing of diamonds, as the majority of the diamond offices have their own synthetic diamond detection equipment. Even if the merchants are dealing in lab-grown diamonds they are doing it with full disclosure”

Manhar Sutaria, member, Mahidhapura diamond brokers association

AHMEDABAD: A 26-year-old woman has allegedly been attacked for the second time in 20 days by two girls. The attackers are yet to be identified. The victim, a Vastral resident, lodged a complaint on Friday stating that she is being stalked by the two girls. She said she was attacked on both occasions near Navrangpura Crossroads.

Inspector P B Desai of the Navrangpura police station said that the victim she stated she has no enmity with anyone. “We have gathered CCTV footage and are trying to identify the two girls and the autorickshaw in which they arrived,” Desai said.

According to the FIR, the victim works in a private company in Navrangpura as a team leader. She has mentioned in the FIR that while she was going home at about 6pm 20 days ago, the two girls approached her and pushed her. The girls told the victim to watch where she was going and then scratched her face. The attackers fled when people gathered around them.

According to the FIR, on February 5, when the victim was standing on Navrangpura Road, an autorickshaw approached her. A girl was already seated inside. The victim boarded the autorickshaw. Soon, another girl boarded the autorickshaw.

“According to the victim, one of the girls started pulling her while the other scratched her face,” a police official said. “The victim pleaded with the driver to stop but he threatened her with dire consequences. When the autorickshaw slowed down, the victim jumped out.”

The victim then called her boss and told him about what had happened. “The victim said she was so frightened by the attack that she lodged the FIR only three days later,” the police official said.

KOLKATA: Door-frame metal detectors (DFMDs) and hand-held scanners at the Kolkata airport security check will be replaced by full-body scanners. According to Kolkata airport director Kaushik Bhattacharjee, the first 17 scanners will be installed by March.“The body scanners will replace DFMDs and the practice of pat-down searches of passengers to detect objects that are not allowed in a flight cabin,” Bhattacharjee said.The Bureau of Civil Aviation Safety (BCAS), the watchdog agency for ensuring safety and security on flights, decided on full-body scanners to detect non-metallic weapons and explosives that can be concealed on the body since DFMDs and hand-held scanners are unable to detect them. “The nature of threat is changing. To keep pace with it, there is a need for technological upgrade. Body scanners can detect plastic explosives and terrorism tools, including chemical, biological and radiation,” a security consultant said.Addressing privacy concerns over use of scanners that had cropped up in the West, an official said the image generated would be that of a generic mannequin and not a flyer’s actual body contours with threats represented graphically. Apart from addressing security issues, deployment of body scanners is also aimed at accelerating passenger clearance processes since manual frisking takes more time per passenger, an official said.Kolkata airport is on the list classified as hypersensitive. Other airports that will get body scanners include Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai, Guwahati and Srinagar. Currently, the US has the largest number of body scanners at airports.

SURAT: In a bid to scuttle students’ attempts to celebrate Valentine 's Day, the district education officer (DEO) in Surat has issued a circular to all schools in the city and district to organise ‘Matru Pitru Poojan Divas’ - Mother Father Worship Day by students on February 14 .

In the covering letter of the circular the education department has stated: “In current times the youth is blindly following those practices which are against the glorious tradition of our country. To nurture best values from childhood and to protect our culture, Mother-Father Worship Day message should be given.”

Apart from instructions to organise the ‘worship day’, the schools have also been asked to send photos of the event in reply to the DEO.

The letter also instructs schools on how to celebrate the day.

The schools will have to call five to 10 parents belonging to different religions and castes. They will also have to invite members of Nagar Prathmik Shikshan Samiti’s members, Surat Municipal Corporation (SMC) members, municipal councillors, educationalist or social worker to witness the event.

“In the event, the children should worship their parents in accordance to Indian tradition with tilak, garland, vandan – with folded hands, circumambulating in pradakshina and offering them sweets. A speech should also be delivered about importance of parents in life,” it read.

DEO H H Rajyaguru defended the circular saying that there is nothing wrong in worshipping one’s parents. “The circular only asks schools to follow our tradition. There is no other issue in it,” he said, refusing to elaborate further on why the worship is to be specifically organized on V-Day.

Director of Centre for Social Studies, Kiran Desai told TOI that it is not the role of the education department to get involved in such non-academic activities. “Of course, Valentine’s Day has nothing to do with our culture and I am against any kind of vulgarity or wrongdoings. But at the same time when we have accepted many western things without objections, we should not try to impose religious rituals on students and bring parents in between,” he said.

RAJKOT: Opposition Congress in Rajkot Municipal Corporation (RMC) has alleged that the civic body was acting leniently against owners of mobile towers, who owe it Rs42 crore in property tax dues.

Vashram Sagathiya, leader of opposition in BJP-controlled RMC, alleged that since April 2018 tax dues have been reduced for mobile towers, thus also providing benefit to mobile companies. RMC has launched a special campaign to collect outstanding property tax dues from commercial and industrial property owners, with even sealing many of their premises. He alleged, “RMC was to collect tax dues from 701 mobile tower owners, but over 150 of them have been spared. Interestingly, about 38 towers are not even on the record of the civic body. This has been done with an intention to provide benefit to mobile companies.”

Sagathiya also asked the civic body to aggressively collect tax dues from central government organizations like Indian Railways and India Post.

Sri Lanka's PM Mahinda Rajapaksa during a media briefing

VARANASI: In his first foreign diplomatic tour after assuming charge as the island nation’s head, Sri Lankan Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa will visit Kashi Vishwanath Temple in Varanasi and Buddhist shrines in Sarnath on Sunday.

Rajapaksa arrived in New Delhi on Friday on a five-day visit to India. He met Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday. The two leaders discussed various issues including bilateral ties between India and Sri Lanka.

Meanwhile, the district administration was busy with preparations for Rajapaksa’s visit on Saturday. Varanasi district magistrate Kaushal Raj Sharma said, “The Sri Lankan Prime Minster will make only two stops in the city following his arrival on Sunday. He will offer prayers at Kashi Vishwanath Temple and will head to Sarnath late afternoon. After staying the night, he will leave for Bodh Gaya on Monday morning.”

ADG (Varanasi zone) Brij Bhushan and other officials took stock of security arrangements at Kashi Vishwanath Temple and in Sarnath. The culture department also conducted rehearsals for events to be organised along roads during Rajapaksa’s visit.

Apart of the Sri Lankan PM, Varanasi and its neighbouring districts are expected to witness a slew of VIP visits till February-end.

Chief minister Yogi Adityanath will be in Varanasi for two days, starting Monday, to review preparations for PM Narendra Modi’s proposed visit to the city on February 16. President Ram Nath Kovind is also expected to stay in the city for a night after visiting Sonbhadra in February last week.

On his proposed visit, Modi will inaugurate and launch various projects worth Rs 1,210 crore. He will also unveil a statue of Pandit Deen Dayal Upadhyayas at Padao and inaugurate the Lehartara-Chowkaghat flyover.

Sharma said Governor Anandiben Patel will be in the city on a personal visit on Monday. “During his visit, the CM will visit Padao to inspect the statue of Pandit Deen Dayal Upadhyaya, apart from reviewing other preparations,” the district magistrate said.

Yogi is likely to visit Varanasi on the occasion of Mahashivratri on February 21, said Sharma.

Following Modi’s victory in the 2014 Lok Sabha election, his parliamentary constituency Varanasi has welcomed the heads of several nations including Japanese PM Shinzo Abe, French President Emmanuel Macron and German President Frank-Walter Steinmeire to its scenic ghats.

JODHPUR: Close on the heels of a person who was abducted and freed after paying Rs 8 lakh here, another person was abducted and let off after an extortion demand of Rs 3 lakh was met. The kidnappers thrashed him badly before dropping him on the road.

The victim filed a complaint of abduction and extortion with the police on Friday night after recovering from the injuries.

According to Pratapnagar police, Aduram Jat stated in his complaint that he was abducted on February 2 by four persons, when he was going in his car near Kailana Lake.

“They stopped at a hotel on Jaisalmer-Jodhpur highway, consumed liquor and beat him. On the way, they demanded Rs 5 lakh as ransom in order to free him. But after expressing his inability to pay the amount, one of them fired a bullet in his leg,” said the complaint.

“The victim, when insisted by the abductors, called up his brother, who expressed his capability to pay Rs 3 lakh only. The abductors then called him at the Riktiya Bheruji circle, collected money from him and pushed Aduram at the circle before fleeing,” said the complaint.

His brother took him to the hospital and after revering from the injuries, Adurma reached the police with his brother on Friday night and filed a complaint against four persons.

“We have begun the investigation into the matter and have been trying to verify the allegations made by the complainant,” said a police official.

It may be noted that before this incident, one person from Mandore areas, Amar Singh Sankhal had also filed a complaint with the police alleging abduction by one Pawan Sankhla, a history-sheeter, and extortion of Rs 8 lakh.

Coimbatore: Chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswami on Saturday said his government won’t intervene in the investigation into the TNPSC scam and that they only wanted a fair probe in the case.

Addressing the media at the city airport, he said the Tamil Nadu Public Service Commission (TNPSC) was an independent body and the state police have been investigating the case. “Police have arrested the people who are involved in the scam. The AIADMK government won’t intervene in the inquiry. We want a fair probe to be conducted,” the chief minister said.

He blamed the media for playing up the issue of forest minister Dindigul C Sreenivasan seeking the help of a tribal boy to remove his slippers while he was in the Nilgiris. “He is 70 years old and he was not able to bend and remove a small stick that was stuck in his slipper. So, he sought the tribal boy’s help. He also explained that the boy was like his grandson. Yet, he has sought apology from the boy and his family. The media overplayed the issue and it hurt us severely. AIADMK ministers or any other party functionary won’t involve in such activities at any situation.”

When asked about the cancellation of Class V and Class VIII public exams, the chief minister said they could be cancelled easily. “If we cancel all examinations, how can we evaluate the ability of the children? It will only help the students spend their days within the state as they cannot go out for job. Exams help evaluate the ability of students. Only if we conduct exams, we can ascertain their ability.” He said the exams were cancelled based on the parents’ request.

Pointing out that the public wasn’t aware of the school dropout rate, Palaniswami said the state government had been taking steps to reduce the same.

Regarding the controversial communal remarks that were made by dairy development minister Rajendra Balaji, Palaniswami said he was not aware about the charges leveled against the former. “He is a devotee and he has expressed his own opinion and not that of the party.”

Rajendra Balaji had in a recent interview said some outfits were orchestrating Islamic terrorism. “If they are functioning like that, definitely Hindu terrorism will also be formed and no one could stop that,” he had said. Seizing the opportunity, DMK chief M K Stalin had mounted a scathing attack on the minister, who he said was speaking against secularism. A few days ago, the DMK had petitioned governor Banwarilal Purohit, seeking to remove Rajendra Balaji from the minister post for his hate speech. The opposition party had also petitioned the director general of police against the minister.

The city all-woman police (west) identified the accused as K Anand. He is employed with a PVC door manufacturing unit at Kamarajapuram.

According to an investigation officer, the victim’s parents would leave home for work in the morning and return only in the evening. “So, the mother would drop the girl at her younger sister’s house in the same locality. On Thursday night, the girl was unable to sleep and started crying. When the girl’s aunt approached her to know what happened, she told her that Anand had given her chocolate and taken to the manufacturing unit, where he sexually assaulted her,” the officer said.

Immediately, the girl’s mother lodged a complaint with the all-woman police (west), who registered a case against Anand under Sections 5 (m)(l) read with 6 of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (Pocso) Act and Sections 376 (A)(B) and 506(i) of the Indian Penal Code.

10 persons were reported to be trapped inside

AHMEDABAD: At least four persons were reported dead in a major fire at a textile unit on Narol-Pirana Road on Saturday evening. A total of 19 vehicles from Ahmedabad Fire and Emergency Services (AFES) were pressed into operation as the blaze continued in the unit.

AFES officials said they received a call at 5.48pm reporting a major blaze in the premises of Nandan Denim Ltd on Narol-Pirana Road. “Based on the initial report, initially 12 vehicles were dispatched to the spot. After assessing the severity, seven more were called from nearby fire stations. In all, there were two snorkels, five multi-purpose vehicles and eight tankers among other vehicles,” said a senior AFES official.

Officials said that the ground floor and first floor of the denim production unit were spread across a length of 200 feet. “The discovery of the bodies took time as the unit officials failed to intimate us about potential trapping of workers inside. The interiors suggested that there were only two major exit points, making it difficult for the staff members to make a dash,” said an AFES official. “In total, 10 persons were reported to be trapped inside, the search for others is on.” Nearby residents also rushed to the spot after news of persons trapped in the fire spread in the area. Relatives of the workers also gheraoed the management over the deaths. AFES officials said that the bodies are completely charred and are kept in the same spot. “It’s difficult to ascertain age, gender or any other features. It is likely that the only way they can be identified would be to take the overall stock of the workers in the shift,” said the official. “They would not have got any time to escape.”

A senior executive from Nandan Denim Ltd told TOI that they are yet to ascertain the starting point of the blaze and extent of damage. “The incident primarily affected the shirting division of the premises. We are cooperating with the AFES,” said the official.

“At 10.15pm, most of the area was under control, but there were still embers in several places due to flame from fire in the stock. Thus, it’s likely that some vehicles would be deployed throughout the night,” said an official.

Representative image

BHUBANESWAR: The higher education department has asked degree colleges in the state not to allow admission of students through offline counselling.

The department shifted to online admission of students from 2011-12 academic session. It has recently found out that some colleges violated admission rules and admitted students through offline counselling.

The department on Wednesday asked three degree colleges to show cause for violating admission rules. The colleges include Raja Madhusudan Dev Degree College of Science and Education in Patia (Bhubaneswar), Krishna Institute of Management and Science (KIMS) in Bhubaneswar and Ghuna Degree College, Ghuna in Balangir.

Jayanta Narayan Sarangi, additional secretary of the higher education department, said the institutions have been asked to respond by February 15.

“The college in Patia has requested the department to regularize admission of 51 students (21 in arts, 14 in commerce and 16 in science) into Plus-III first year, who did not apply through the student academic management system (a single window system for e-admission) in the last admission session,” Sarangi wrote in the showcause notice sent to the college principal.

“This apart, some students have been allotted honours degree by the college without adhering to the cut off marks. It is a gross violation of e-admission rules,” Sarangi added.

Similarly, KIMS has requested the department for regularization of admission of 52 students (33 in arts, seven in commerce and 12 in science) into Plus III first year classes. The number of students admitted to the Balangir college through offline counselling is 21.

While the principals of two colleges could not be contacted, KIMS principal Swarnalata Mishra said they have responded to the department’s notice.

“We have warned all colleges not to admit any student through offline counselling. It will land them into trouble,” a senior official of the department said. The state has 52 government degree colleges and more than 1,000 government aided and private colleges.

84,['9/02/2020'],BMC sets up portal to get rid of construction waste,"This story is from February 9, 2020

Representative image

BHUBANESWAR: The Bhubaneswar Municipal Corporation ( BMC ) will develop a web portal that will display the progress of construction work and provide detailed information on the waste left behind by various departments.

The idea behind creating the web portal — which will contain the details of construction work under different departments — is to fix responsibility with the department that generates construction and demolition (C&D) waste and leaves them unattended along the road. Anyone can access the website and let the BMC know about the location of the waste and the agency who has undertaken the work. It will help the residents, the BMC and government departments.

BMC officials said people always approached the corporation for removing C&D waste without having any information about the agency that generated it. They added that the BMC always removed the waste (irrespective of the department generating it) to avoid inconveniencing the people.

BMC deputy commissioner (sanitation) Subhendu Sahu said the website would be accessible to all departments that take up construction work under the BMC’s jurisdiction. “It will function like a grievance redress platform. Residents can let the BMC know where the waste is being dumped. The BMC will draw the attention of the department concerned to the complaint on the same portal,” Sahu added. He further said, “In case an agency expresses inability to lift the waste, it will have to pay transportation fee to the BMC, which will act on its behalf. Every communication will be recorded on the portal.”

Though the BMC’s C&D waste management rules came into effect in 2016, they are not strictly enforced. The civic body had earlier launched a drive to seize waste and fine people for dumping it in public places, but it is yet to come up with a strategy if the waste is generated by a government department.

BMC commissioner Prem Chandra Chaudhury said most roads in the city belonged to the works department. “Any waste generated after construction of a road under the works department should be handled by them,” he added.

“There are multiple agencies involved in various works in the city such as digging earth for laying cables. In such a case, the road-owning department should be paid to remove waste by the agency or the department laying cables. The same should be intimated to the BMC for better coordination,” Chaudhury said.

The waste generated through construction, repair, re-modelling and demolition of private and government establishments, households, roads and drains, should be handled carefully to avoid littering. If abandoned, it encroaches on road and makes the city ugly. It also causes accidents.

91,['9/02/2020'],nCoV outbreak in China can spur textile sector biz in India,"This story is from February 9, 2020

Coimbatore: With China reeling under the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) outbreak, Indian textile sector could potentially use the situation to its advantage, said industry representatives on Saturday. Pointing out that cargo movement in and out of China has been hit heavily, they said the global textile supply chain that was dependent on China would have to rely on other countries for import. “And India could tap into this opportunity.”

According to Rajkumar, chairman, Confederation of Indian Textile Industry, stakeholders, who were importing textiles from China, especially Southeast Asian countries, would look for alternatives, and India, with its capacity, could capitalize on the situation.

Speaking to reporters in the city, he said the opportunity could push up export of finished textile goods, clothing and fabrics by at least 20%-30%, providing an immediate relief from the drop in exports last year.

Rajkumar said the slump in China was a good opportunity for India. “Ships are not going there, and the number of flights has come down. This might take another 30 to 60 days to set things right. This would directly impact the world supply chain, which would at any time have 30 to 60 days stock.

If China doesn’t produce for 30 days, he said, orders might come to India. “It might come to Tirupur or Ludhiana. The possibilities of exporting cotton yarn, polyester yarn and viscose yarn from here also would go up. We have to wake up and work quickly to tap the opportunity.”

China's main clients in Vietnam, Cambodia, Thailand, Korea and in the European Union could possibly turn to India for buying finished gods, clothing and fabrics, he said. “This is a big opportunity to Indian textile sector. Inquiries have started pouring in. It would take another week to pick up,” he said.

With textile export falling in the past couple of years, this surge would help the industry become buoyant, he said. In the past two years, the export had come down from 100 million kilo per month to 60 million kilo and then 40 million kilo, he said. As the industry’s capacity was not utilized fully because of the fall, he said, the facilities were ready to meet the possible demand.

However, the situation also has a flipside. With the slowdown down due to the virus outbreak, yarn exports to China, which has been picking up, would take a hit, Rajkumar said.

VARANASI: Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra will visit Ravidas temple in Seer Gowardhanpur area on Sunday and attend celebrations on the occasion of birth anniversary of Sant Ravidas .

Thousands of followers of Sant Ravidas attend celebrations organised at his birthplace Seer Gowardhanpur every year. The district administration and police are working on arrangements to ensure a comfortable stay for the pilgrims.

She would return to Delhi the same day.

Ahmedabad: A search operation carried out by the income tax (I-T) department on Friday covering five city-based jewellers continued on Saturday at 10 locations. While the officials did not disclose the finds, sources close to development said that the primary purpose of the action was to identify unaccounted cash and cash transactions which were not getting reflected in official books of account.

According to sources, various teams carried out the search at Om Jewellers, Manek Chowk; Ashtmangal Chains, Manek Chowk and CG Road; Shyam Bullion, CG Road; Suvarna Samriddhi, CG Road; RH Zaveri, Shivranjani Crossroads; and Rajeshkumar Mandaliya, Ratanpol.

“Impounding of the books of account, digital records and transaction details were conducted by the teams. Excess stock of both stock and cash were found at several of the premises. The search was on for almost entire day and the tabulation of what’s been found is being done,” said an official.

In December, a large number of firms associated with bullion trade and jewellery business had received notices over alleged non-disclosure of cash transactions post demonetization. The trade bodies had also protested against the move, terming the action ‘harassment.’ The officials however mentioned that the move is to identify the transactions where the demonetized currency was used for purchase of gold bars and jewellery.

“The transactions carried out in past three years, the stock taken and sold and the cash, digital and cheque payments are under scanner. Further probe is on,” said the official.

COIMBATORE: Earlier, T Meena, a final-year nursing student from Dharapuram in Tirupur, had no idea that she could become a nurse in a hospital in the United Kingdom (UK). However, after attending the Overseas Manpower Corporation Limited (OMCL)’s registration drive on Saturday she said she was now hopeful of becoming a nurse in the UK. “I think the prospects have widened,” she said.

Like Meena, around 200 final-year nursing students from Coimbatore, Ooty, Tirupur and Erode had gathered to enroll themselves with the OMCL, a state government undertaking, at the drive that it conducted at the district employment office on Mettupalayam Road in the city. They were seeking an opportunity to become nurses in England and Ireland, with a monthly pay of Rs 2 lakh to Rs 2.5 lakh.

Representatives of OMCL said they had been facilitating jobseekers from the state to find jobs abroad for more than 40 years. B Somasundaram, recruitment coordinator, OMCL, said they have signed a memorandum of understanding with the Health Education England in the UK for sending 500 nurses from India to that country every year. “We would be offering the nurses free coaching for taking up the International English Language Testing System (IELTS) exam, which is a requisite for getting a job in the UK. We have tied up with the British Council for that.”

He said the first batch of candidates, around 15 people, have started training for the IELTS exam. “We would start sending nursing candidates to the UK in six months.”

Speaking about the process, Somasundaram said OMCL would register the candidates and upload their details online. After they take up the IELTS exam, their score would get uploaded on the portal. “Candidates would be tracked through an online application system. Following this, personnel from the UK would come down to interview and recruit them.”

A Jothimani, deputy director of employment, Coimbatore, said they have been planning to bring personnel from the British Council to the district employment office to train candidates. “This is the second registration drive after the one that we held last November.

COIMBATORE: Earlier, T Meena, a final-year nursing student from Dharapuram in Tirupur, had no idea that she could become a nurse in a hospital in the United Kingdom (UK). However, after attending the Overseas Manpower Corporation Limited (OMCL)’s registration drive on Saturday she said she was now hopeful of becoming a nurse in the UK. “I think the prospects have widened,” she said.

Like Meena, around 200 final-year nursing students from Coimbatore, Ooty, Tirupur and Erode had gathered to enroll themselves with the OMCL, a state government undertaking, at the drive that it conducted at the district employment office on Mettupalayam Road in the city. They were seeking an opportunity to become nurses in England and Ireland, with a monthly pay of Rs 2 lakh to Rs 2.5 lakh.

Representatives of OMCL said they had been facilitating jobseekers from the state to find jobs abroad for more than 40 years. B Somasundaram, recruitment coordinator, OMCL, said they have signed a memorandum of understanding with the Health Education England in the UK for sending 500 nurses from India to that country every year. “We would be offering the nurses free coaching for taking up the International English Language Testing System (IELTS) exam, which is a requisite for getting a job in the UK. We have tied up with the British Council for that.”

He said the first batch of candidates, around 15 people, have started training for the IELTS exam. “We would start sending nursing candidates to the UK in six months.”

Speaking about the process, Somasundaram said OMCL would register the candidates and upload their details online.

101,['9/02/2020'],‘Agri expo violation of civic body’s resolution’,"This story is from February 9, 2020

Kolhapur: MLA Chandrakant Jadhav alleged on Saturday that the agriculture exhibition on the Merry Weather Ground was a strict violation of the civic administration’s decision to reserve the ground exclusively for sports activites.

Jadhav’s claims come in the wake of the allegations raised by BJP functionary Dhananjay Mahadik. During the inauguration ceremony of the agriculture exhibition on Friday, Mahadik alleged that based on the instructions of guardian minister Satej Patil, Jadhav was obstructing the smooth conduct of the expo. The exhibition is being held at the same ground for the last 13 years.

“Those obstructing the exhibition are against the welfare of the farmers, who come from the rural areas to see the various breeds of animals as well as the new technologies available for farming,” said the former MP. Mahadik also refuted the allegations that money from Gokul dairy was being siphoned to hold the exhibition.

Jadhav said, “The grounds are the lungs of the city. I myself have remained a football player and as an MLA, it is my duty to protect the rights of the players. I had requested the organisers to shift the location, but they did not pay heed to the request. When the exhibition is held, the ground is not just blocked for a week but also undergoes extensive damage.”

“KMC had passed a resolution to allow only sports activities on the ground. The state government had also given its approval to the resolution. The exhibition is still being held,” he said.

“Earlier, the BJP-led government used to bypass KMC’s objections while approving permission for the exhibition. The organisers even failed to allocate space for the citizens so they atleast can take a walk in the morning and evening,” said Jadhav.

102,['9/02/2020'],Chitale Dairy’s Kakasaheb passes away,"This story is from February 9, 2020

Kolhapur: Dattatray Bhaskar Chitale, the man responsible for many modernising efforts in the dairy business, passed away on Saturday at Miraj in Sangli district. He died of a heart attack at the age of 78.

As per Chitale Dairy’s management, Kakasaheb — as Dattatray Bhaskar Chitale was fondly called — had inherited the Chitale Dairy business started by his father at Bhilawadi, which was located along a rail route in Sangli district, in 1939.

After graduation, he, along with his brothers, looked after the dairy which then was limited to just one village. At that time, even as the co-operative sector was growing, he and his brothers managed to run and expand the private business successfully. While he looked after the dairy, his brother Bhausaheb started the famous Chitale Bandhu Mithaiwale at Pune in 1950.

Kakasaheb was a household name among the farmer community. He connected with most of the dairy farmers in three talukas of the district. Chitale’s small milk collection centres helped the youth in the villages earn money. Under his watch, the farmers were provided with the high milk yielding buffaloes and cows. In recent years, he took a keen interest in the breeding of cows with the help of advanced technology.

He also set up library and schools in the region apart from being associated with several social organisations in the district.

CANDOLIM: The upgradation of the Candolim primary health centre ( PHC ) will begin after almost three years of its announcement.

Soon after the last assembly elections, health minister Vishwajit Rane had inspected the health centre in May 2017 and announced that the government had made a budgetary provision of Rs 10 crore for a new PHC, work on which, was to start in September that year. “This is a prime tourist area and we need to have a modern health centre here with a stress on trauma and emergency relief. This PHC has outlived its time,” Rane had said during the visit.

Soon after making the announcement, the old Mangalore roof tiles of the health centre had been replaced with galvanised sheets at a cost of Rs 10 lakh to stop the water leakage during monsoon. However, work on the new PHC had been stalled. Sources said that work was also delayed due to lack of funds.

BAREILLY: City’s long wait for a ‘jhumka’ (dome or bell-shaped chandelier earring) finally got over on Saturday, with Union minister of state (independent charge) and local MP Santosh Gangwar unveiling nearly 14-foot-high and two quintals heavy jhumka at the ‘zero-point’ on the National Highway 24 in Parsakhera area.Although the city has no direct link with jhumka, taking a cue from the song ‘Jhumka Gira Re Bareilly Ke Bazaar Main’ from the 1966 blockbuster ‘Mera Saaya’, which inadvertently associated Bareilly with jhumka, three years ago, the Bareilly Development Authority (BDA) conceived the project of installing a jhumka as an attraction for the tourists visiting the city. The project, however, hit roadblocks several times before taking a concrete shape.Bareilly division commissioner Ranvir Prasad, local MLA Arun Kumar and Bollywood actor Mukesh Bharti were among prominent chief guests who lit the traditional lamp before Gangwar inaugurated the jhumka — embedded with colourful stones and decorated by city’s famous ‘zari’ embroidery.Praising the BDA, MoS for labour and employment Gangwar said, “The collaborative effort made by the authority, various organisations and local residents in setting up of the ambitious jhumka in Bareilly is commendable. It looks beautiful and unique. Visitors will finally be able to associate the landmark jhumka in Bareilly with the evergreen song.”The project costs BDA around Rs 18 lakh — Rs 8 lakh for the jhumka and Rs 10 lakh for the beautification of the landscape surrounding the main structure. Notably, no government money was used for the project, even as it faced fund crunch several times, said BDA officials.Speaking to TOI, BDA vice-chairperson Divya Mittal said, “The jhumka was supposed to be inaugurated on the New Year eve, but it got delayed for some unavoidable reasons. The beautiful project is a collaborative effort among Rohilkhand Medical College, Bareilly International University and few other organisations, and local residents who helped BDA with funds in giving the shape to the ambitious project that would be considered a landmark.“The location, design, decoration and several other things were decided by the authority, which employed skilled artisans who worked diligently ensuring that the jhumka becomes a major attraction for the tourists.”BDA secretary AK Singh said, “Once the inauguration ceremony was over, people throng the venue to have a glimpse of the jhumka and were seen taking selfies and group photographs with the jhumka in their background.”Bareilly district magistrate Nitish Kumar, DIG (Bareilly range) Rajesh Kumar Pandey, SSP Shailesh Kumar Pandey, prominent physician Dr Keshav Agarwal and senior BDA officers, including Mittal, were also present on the occasion.",bareilly,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74047698,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-479797,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/jhumka-finally-at-bareilly-ke-bazaar-mein/articleshow/74034538.cms
105,['9/02/2020'],Centenary church to mark 100 yrs of Gunadala shrine,"This story is from February 9, 2020

Vijayawada: A new church, with a seating capacity of over 3,500 devotees, is being envisioned at the foot of the Gunadala hill in the city on the occasion of the centenary year celebrations of the holy shrine of Mother Mary . Work on the structure has already begun and is planned to be completed within the next three years, in time for the 100-year celebrations of the shrine.

What started as a small prayer service for inmates of St Joseph’s orphanage in 1923, is now the second biggest pilgrimage for Christians in south India, next only to Velankkani in Tamil Nadu. Lakhs of devotees have already converged in the city from across the country for the three-day annual Mary Matha fest, which begins on Sunday.

Though the centenary year is still three years away, the management of the shrine, headed by bishop Joseph Raja Rao, has already begun preparations for the celebrations. While the existing church at the foot of the hill would continue to provide religious services to visiting devotees, a new and bigger church is being planned keeping in view the increasing number of pilgrims visiting the shrine year after year. The annual festival has been gaining in popularity over the years, with lakhs of devotees from across the country visiting the shrine during the three-day fest. Special train services by Indian railways and bus services by APSRTC are run during before and after the festival to cater to pilgrims’ rush.

A statue of Mother Mary, weighing 300 kgs, was brought to the city from Italy in 1951 and was installed in the cave, replacing the one that was initially installed in 1924. “The city (Vijayawada) is blessed with deities presiding over it on two sides. While goddess Kanakadurga sits atop Indrakeeladri hill on one side, Mother Mary is there on Gunadala hill on the other side,” says Fr EW Jaya Rajuthe, the shrine’s rector.

“We see a lot of non-Catholics visiting the shrine regularly. Hindus and Muslims perform their own style of rituals here, which we welcome,” he added.

The church had improvised direct access to the main road from the foot of the hill in the last two years, thus making the shrine visible from far. With the festival set to begin with the celebration of Holy Eucharist on Sunday, city police have provided elaborate security arrangements all through, including atop the hill.

Coimbatore: The Southern India Mills Association (Sima) would organize an interaction session for textile industry stakeholders from South India with Union textile secretary Ravi Capoor in the city on Wednesday (February 12).

Stakeholders could use the platform to provide their inputs for the national textile policy to the Union textile secretary, said T Rajkumar, chair of the Confederation of Indian Textile Industry (CITI), here on Saturday. He said they have invited representatives of textile associations from Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka to participate in the interaction session.

Speaking of the announcements for the textile sector in the Union budget, he said abolition of anti-dumping duty on Purified Terephthalic Acid (PTA), a raw material for producing polyester, would enable the Indian textile industry to become globally competitive in the manmade fibre market. Indian polyester and other man-made fibres could not be sold for globally competitive rates due to the anti-dumping duty on PTA, which prevailed from 1996 to 2000 and from 2014 to 2020. “There wasa difference of Rs 15 between the international rates and Indian rates. Because of this, we couldn’t venture into making polyester products such as swimsuits or winter wear,” he said.

Rajkumar said on December 26 last year, representatives from various sections of the textile sector had met prime minister Narendra Modi in New Delhi and presented him their demands for the Union budget. “Half of our demands has been met in the budget.” tnn

AHMEDABAD: The Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation wiped out the rangoli themed on the Indian tricolour, on Saturday morning, following a report published by TOI.

On Friday, the revamped version of the 64-year-old ‘Khau Gali’ at Law Garden was inaugurated by chief minister Vijay Rupani. The inauguration served up a controversy after people were seen walking on a footpath over the rangoli. The rangoli also featured an image of Patang hotel.

Enraged netizens reacted strongly on various social media platforms to videos which showed many people walking over the rangoli late on Friday evening. Early on Saturday, the AMC ordered all rangolis to be removed.

An AMC official said: “But when we reached the spot, there was not much of the rangoli left as many people had walked over it.”

On social media platforms, many citizens had red-flagged the offence on Friday, tagging municipal commissioner Vijay Nehra and mayor Bijal Patel. A twitter user, C Shekhar Dave (CShekharDave1), had tweeted: “Insult of National Flag By People. Flag created at Happy Street Law Garden by municipal corporation”.

Kolhapur: Officials of the civic administration have appealed to citizens to come forward and render information about the rented properties in their localities on the assurance that their identities would remain confidential.

Several discrepancies have been reported in the property tax collection. Officials from the property tax department said that many owners had been evading taxes on their rented properties for several years. Complaints have poured in from several quarters stating that the evasion was taking place at the behest of property tax officials. Recently, a couple of rented properties were found, for which property tax assessed was much less than the actual tax.

Senior officials from the property tax department said that since there was a nexus between the local authorities and the property owners, it was difficult to find out the actual number of rented properties and that only the information from citizens could be relied upon.

Chief superintendent of the property tax department Sanjay Bhosale said, “We have appealed to the citizens to provide details of the rented properties in their localities. Owners may rent out properties for commercial or residential purposes. Many times, owners hide the details of their rented properties. We have observed that such properties are registered differently in our system. As of now, we have received the details of over 60 rented properties from citizens and we are randomly scrutinising by visiting these properties.”

Sources in the civic administration said that if unearthed properly, a huge scam may likely surface from the property tax department.

“A couple of years ago, a firm that was roped in to identify and register new properties in the city also came under scanner. Many activists and corporators had raised allegations stating that the surveyors of the firm were bribed by owners to either not register their rented properties or tax them with lesser assessment,” said souces in the civic administration.

Meanwhile, municipal commissioner Mallinath Kalshetti decided to transfer some staff from other departments to the property tax department on Saturday and initiated the recovery of property tax. A team of officials will be set up at the divisional-ward level for sealing properties, which have not paid tax for several years.

115,['9/02/2020'],Civic body hopes to improve citizen perception ranking,"This story is from February 9, 2020

Vijayawada: After Swachh Survekshan 2020, Vijayawada Municipal Corporation (VMC) has shifted its focus to improving the city’s rank in Citizen Perception Survey , which is a part of Ease of Living Index assessment. The city which ranked 9th in 2018 is eyeing to break into the top five.

VMC commissioner Prasanna Venkatesh said that Ease of Living Index is assessed based on four major pillars — institutional, economical, educational and physical — and 15 key indicators which include safety and security, education, governance, health and public open spaces. The survey is conducted to achieve an evidence-based approach for future interventions and investments to deliver easy living outcomes, Venkatesh said.

“This is a prestigious survey and feedback given by the citizens will help us identify the core issues in the city. We have streamlined door-to-door garbage collection and street cleaning. We are using central government schemes like AMRUT, Housing for All and others to develop infrastructure,” Venkatesh said.

The civic body has started encouraging people to give their feedback in the survey. Around 114 cities across the country are competing in this survey and most of them are Smart Cities. Although Vijayawada is not a smart city, it was given a chance considering the initiatives of the urban local body, said additional commissioner U Sarada Devi.

Each city is given a score between 0 and 100. A core indicator carries 70% weightage while a supporting indicator carries 30% weightage. Institutional (25 points), social (25 points), economy and employment (5 points), and physical (45 points). Citizens are requested to answer the questionnaire in the online portal https://eol2019.org/CitizenFeedback or mobile application.

116,['9/02/2020'],"KMC to install new light poles, shift existing ones","This story is from February 9, 2020

Kolhapur: To improve the lighting across the city, the Kolhapur Municipal Corporation (KMC) is all set to install new street light poles and shift some existing ones.

The civic administration had earlier received flak from corporators for using low-wattage LED bulbs, which created many ‘dark zones’ in the city. The KMC’s move to install more powerful bulbs was also slammed by the corporators, who said that the new bulbs were simply not powerful enough and that the dark zones were causing accidents along certain stretches.

The civic administration recently surveyed with the help of the electricity department staff and concluded that many neighborhoods, especially the ones in the suburbs and extended colonies in Ward E, need more street light poles. The survey also showed that some of these poles need to be realigned to spread the lighting uniformly.

Netradip Sarnobat, chief city engineer of the KMC said: “We have decided to take up short-term and long-term measures to get rid of these dark zones. The installation of the new poles and shifting of the existing ones are part of the long-term measures, which will take us a month to complete after the work order has been issued. Also, newly developed colonies do not have a proper network of street lights. We aim to start the work of shifting and installing poles in two wards. Our survey has shown that there are many roads with dark zones.”

Corporators had demanded that 70-watt bulbs will be installed along major roads. They had also asked that the wattage of the bulbs be decided based on the width of a road and if the distance between poles on one side of the road should be taken into consideration. Ideally, poles should not be located on both sides of a road, but this is not the case of the many city roads.

Sarnobat said that though the deadline for correcting flaws in the LED street lighting project ends on February 28, the work of shifting and installing light poles will continue post that too. He added that the same agency, which had executed the the project will be asked to fit LED bulbs of adequate wattage on the new poles.

118,['9/02/2020'],One-day water cuts across city on Monday,"This story is from February 9, 2020

Kolhapur: The entire city is again going to face one-day water cut on Monday.

The Kolhapur Municipal Corporation (KMC) is going to take up the remaining work of electrical installations at the Balinga pumping station, which is claimed to be a part of the upgradation process for the pumping station on Monday. Water supply to A, B, C, D wards and some parts of the E ward along with the suburbs will be cut off for the entire day.

Last week, the city had two-day water cuts. The works involved repair of leakage to a pipeline and the electrical installations, which could not be completed. Pressure from citizens and corporators had forced the KMC to resume the pumping.

“The work of electrical feeder and isolator, which are part of the pumping station, will be carried out now. We have requested the engineers of the electricity board to assist us in the work. We expect the work to be completed in one day. The water supply will resume immediately, unlike last time, when the supply was delayed due to hydraulic testing of the repaired pipeline,” said a senior official of the water supply department on condition of anonymity.

The rural fringe of the city, which depends on the Balinga pumping station for the water supply, too is going to face water cuts on Monday. The officials claim that the water supply may be at low pressure in some of the areas, especially in the D ward, which receives water a little late from the pumping station in comparison to other areas.

The localities that will face water cuts are Lakshtirth Vasahat, Sane Guruji Vasahat, Aptenagar, Rajopadhyenagar, Kanerkar Nagar, Krantisinha Nana Patil Nagar, Devkar Panand and Shivaji University.

The interior parts of the city such as Dudhali, Mangalwar Peth, Gangavesh, Uttareshwar Peth, Shukrawar Peth, Budhwar Peth, Somvar Peth, Bindu Chowk, Mahalaxmi temple area and Udyamnagar too will face water cuts. The water supply department is going to deploy water tankers. The tankers will be kept ready from Sunday evening onwards.

119,['9/02/2020'],Elamkulam plant finding it hard to shed its dry-sewage manure,"This story is from February 9, 2020

The sewage treatment plant at Elamkulam

KOCHI: With virtually no takers, the Elamkulam treatment plant has been stacking up on manure made from the dry sludge of sewage.

The organic matter is piled up in a single-storey storehouse — for which an acre of land has been set apart on the plant’s premises. “Earlier, people from Tamil Nadu used to source the manure and have it transported by lorry for use on farmlands. But, there have been no takers for the past five to 10 years. Farmers here are not interested in using it. So we have been storing the manure in cake form. We have intimated the authorities about lack of takers for the manure, but to no avail,” said an official.

The plant employs the aeration method, in which sewage is collected in a primary tank where sludge is deposited and screening done to separate napkins. The overflowing water is collected in a secondary tank and fanned. The effluent is then moved to a third tank where air is again passed before the effluent is discharged into the nearby waterbody. The sludge which settles in the tank is then treated with anaerobic bacteria for 40 days in two steps before the final dry product is produced. This product is moulded to cake form and dried in sunlight on a drying bed, which covers 40% of the four-acre plot on which the plant is situated.

Authorities said the manure is odourless, unlike the sewage which is piped to the primary tank from the pump houses in Kadavanthra and near the Maharaja’s College Ground.

Moreover, Kerala Water Authority officials have sought an action plan on recycling the effluent. “The effluent water can be used for gardening and landscaping. Along with the action plan, we sent a report on the manure piled up at the store. We are looking forward to anybody buying the manure,” said the official.

120,['9/02/2020'],"7 arrested for duping people of Rs 5cr, hunt launched for 3","This story is from February 9, 2020

Kolhapur: The Economic Offences Wing (EOW), Kolhapur, has booked 10 suspects and arrested seven of them for duping several people to the tune of Rs 5 crore on the pretext of high returns on their investment. A manhunt has been launched to nab the remaining three suspects, said police.

The suspects have been booked under sections 420 (cheating and dishonestly inducing delivery of property), 409 (criminal breach of trust by public servant, or by banker, merchant or agent) and 406 (punishment for criminal breach of trust) of the Indian Penal Code. The arrested suspects were produced before a local court on Saturday and remanded in police custody till February 12.

Police said that the suspects had launched ‘Success Life and Developers’ in 2012 with their main office located near the Central Bus Stand. They had developed their network in the district through a web of agents.

The suspects, along with other staff of their office, used to lure people by promising good returns on their investments. The suspects offered 12% returns to people on various investments in their company.

The complainant, in December 2012, had invested Rs 19 lakh in the company after the prime suspect offered him good returns. He said that he was promised a hefty sum of Rs 5 crore after five years. In 2019, when he approached the company and demanded the promised returns, he was asked to wait for sometime and was assured that his amount will be cleared soon. However, despite repeated visits to the company, the he did not get any money. Realising that he was duped, he lodged a complaint with the Shahupuri police station.

“We have registered a case against 10 members of the company, including directors and other officials, and have forwarded the case to the EOW for further investigation,” said a police officer from the Shahupuri police station.

Police said that they are investigating the case and are gathering information about the transactions carried out by the company so far. “We suspect that they (suspects) might have cheated thousands of people from Kolhapur district to the tune of hundreds of crores,” said an official from the EOW.

“We appeal to people to come forward and register complaints with us if they have been cheated by anyone from this company. We will take note of the complaint and act accordingly, “added the official.

Nashik: The Nashik Regional Transport Office (RTO), between April and December last year, suspended the driving licences of as many as 522 motorists for different violations. The data emerged as city, highway and rural police stepped up their campaigns against drunk drivers and those found talking on the phone while driving.

Police authorities send proposals to the Nashik RTO whenever motorists are caught driving under the influence, speeding and using phones while behind the wheel. Subsequently, the RTO moves to suspend licences for a period of three months.

A senior RTO official said that the police have been getting more stern with motorists, given the rising number of accidents in the region. Last year, there were 1,853 accidents across the district in which 960 people lost their lives and 1,757 people ended up with grievous and minor injuries.

Between April and December 2019, the Nashik RTO received 548 proposals to suspend licences. Out of that number, it moved to suspend 522. The remaining 26, officials said, are in the process of being suspended. Offences such as overloading of vehicles, illegal transport of school students, signal jumping, speaking on the phone and drunk driving featured prominently in the list of proposals sent by the police to the RTO.

The transport officer said suspension of driving licences was a major deterrent.

City and rural police have been conducting awareness programmes to ensure minimal traffic violations. The police have also received high-tech vans to check speeding and driving under the influence alcohol. The RTO officials said the proposals to suspend licences will only increase, given the renewed drives and new equipment.

Mahipalgad, an ancient fort located in Kolhapur district, stands tall on a hill adjacent to the Maharashtra-Karnataka border. The fort dates back to the 16th century and has got its name listed among 111 forts built by Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj. The fort also hosts the Vaijnath temple that dates back to the 11th century. The huge fort and the ancient temple surrounded by dense forest certainly calls for a weekend outing.

How to reach

Mahipalgad is located in Chandgad taluka and is about 126 km away from Kolhapur city. Reaching Mahipalgad from the city is nearly a two-hour drive. Although Mahipalgad is located in Kolhapur district, one will have to travel to Belagavi first and then head towards Mahipalgad by taking Belgavi-Chandgad route. One has to take a right deviation at Shinoli village and then proceed towards Mahipalgad. One can visit the Vaijnath temple en route fort on the uphill road.

Legend has it

The Vaijnath temple was built using Hemadpanti style of architecture. A lot of changes have taken place in its architecture over the years and it can be easily seen by looking at various architecture styles in the sanctum. Jangam Swami, priest at the Vaijnath temple, said, “The temple is built using Hemadpanti architecture. The pillars of the temple are beautifully carved and have two sections, of which one is for Lord Vaijnath (Shiva) and the other one is for Goddess Arogya Bhawani. There is a small stone-carved water pond behind the temple..”

Coimbatore: The residents of Malumichampatty on Saturday said the stench and smoke emanating from the dump yard in their locality have been making their lives miserable. Owned by Malumichampatty town panchayat, the dump yard is located off the Chettipalayam Road.

Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board (TNPCB) officials, who received photographic proof of decomposed waste and burning of garbage there on Friday, said they have issued a notice to the panchayat board.

According to residents, every few days around five to six trucks full of waste is dumped in the yard. The waste is then burned at least twice a week.

Meena, a resident of Sion Nagar, said, “Smoke envelopes the house every time they burn the garbage. Because of this, our eyes start burning due to the irritation. It feels like we can’t breathe. Our children also get respiratory infections due to this.”

Durai Rafeal, another resident of Sion Nagar, said the area was stuck in between Vellalore dump yard and the new dump yard that was set up by the panchayat around six months ago. “Every other day, one of the dump yards start stinking or burning. In fact, two weeks ago, we had caught a group of North Indian boys trying to set the garbage on fire one night and staged a protest the next morning, but to no avail. It feels like we can’t breathe in clean air at any point in our own houses.”

Manimaran, district environment engineer attached to TNPCB, said it was the second notice that they have issued to the town panchayat on Saturday. “Dumping unsegregated waste and burning it is against the rules and law, because when you burn food waste it decomposes, emanating a stench and causing air pollution. If it seeps underground, it can cause pollution of water sources too. If they don’t reply or don’t start complying with the rules, we will take up the issue with Chennai headquarters for further action,” the officer said.

Coimbatore: An elderly couple were hacked to death by their 31-year-old son at Vellimalaipattinam on the outskirts of the city in the early hours of Saturday after they refused to provide him money to buy liquor. The Alandurai police have arrested the murderer.

A police officer identified the deceased as 75-year-old P Sundaram and his 70-year-old wife S Thulasi, of Indira Colony at Vellimalaipattinam near Viraliyur. They are survived by four daughters, who have been married off and settled in various parts of the district, and a son. According to the officer, the couple made a living by grazing goats.

He said their son Karthikeyan was an alcoholic and used to fight with his wife often. “Unable to bear his torture, she had left him a few months ago and moved to her parents’ house at Kaliyapuram village near Madukkarai. A daily wage labourer, he also stopped going for work properly,” the officer said.

Karthikeyan, the officer said, then started to fight with his elderly parents and assault them in drunken state. At one stage, his parents lodged a complaint against Karthikeyan and police warned him severely. “On Thursday (Feb 6) night, he consumed alcohol and assaulted his parents. They again lodged a police complaint against their son. Police picked him up for questioning and he was let off later,” the officer said.

On Friday night, Karthikeyan consumed liquor and fought with his parents, before going to bed. On Saturday around 2am, he hacked his parents, who were asleep, to death with a sickle and left the house.

As the couple didn’t come out of the house in the morning, neighbours went to their house and found them lay dead in a pool of blood. They alerted the Alandurai police, who sent the bodies to the Coimbatore Medical College and Hospital for postmortem. They also registered a case against Karthikeyan under Section 302 (murder) of the Indian Penal Code and formed a special team, which arrested him near Narasipuram. Further investigation is on.

VIJAYAWADA: Amaravati’s protesting farmers knocked on the highest doors for justice, that of god’s, on Saturday. On the 53rd day of protests opposing trifurcation of capital, a group of farmers visited Medaram Sammakka Saralamma Jatara, Asia’s largest tribal festival, accompanied with Dhanasari Anasuya (Seethakka), the present Mulugu MLA, and offered prayers to the goddesses.

It is not new that the protesting farmers sought divine intervention . From its very inception, Amaravati had had a divine connect. It had started with the laying of the foundation stone. The then TDP government had brought holy soil and water from all divine places cutting across religious lines to the region. Seethakka, who was with the TDP then, had brought soil and water from Medaram.

On Saturday, she helped the farmers gain darshan of Sammakka and Saralamma. She said the decision to change the capital will not yield any results.

Speaking to reporters after the darshan, she said, “We have given holy soil and water from Medaram and goddess Sammakka will shower blessings on the farmers of Amaravati who came all the way to Medaram to offer prayers.”

Earlier, the farmers had offered prayers to goddess Kanaka Durga atop of Indrakeeladri in Vijayawada.

In fact, it was the time when the Save Amaravati protests had gained national attention. Police had refused permission to women marching to Indrakeeladri carrying ‘Pongallu’ to goddess Kanaka Durga and had taken them into custody.

Later, they had also prayed at Amaralingeswara Swamy temple in Amaravati, Meesala Venkateswara Swamy temple at Anantavaram and Lakshmi Narasimha Swamy temple at Mangalagiri.

Since the beginning of the protests, farmers, especially the women, of the capital villages belonging to all faiths have been praying and seeking god’s divine intervention, hoping that the government would change the decision.

Nashik: Member secretary of the Maharashtra Pollution Control Board (MPCB), E Ravindran, inaugurated a microwave disinfection system at the Nashik civil hospital on Saturday.

MPCB’s regional Manager J B Sangewal, member Amar Supate, district civil surgeon Suresh Jagdale and additional civil surgeon Nikhil Saindane were among others who were present at the inauguration ceremony.

Saindane said that the machine, manufactured by Meteka GmbH, Austria, has been jointly set up by the Global Environment Facility (GEF), United Nations Industrial Development Organisation (UNIDO), ministry of environment, forest and climate change (MoEFCC) and MPCB at a cost of Rs 80 lakh.

Jagdale said that the purpose of setting up the device was to provide an ideal facility for bio-medical waste management. Senior officials at the civil hospital said that the microwave disinfection device was the first such machine installed at a government hospital in Nashik.

Jagdale said that since Nashik civil hospital was one of the largest civil hospitals in the state,the hospital had a huge inflow of patients throughout the year. Hence, the volune of medical waste produced was also massive.

On any given day, around 700 to 800 intravenous (IV) bottles are used at the hospital, besides other plastic waste. Of the total bio-medical waste produced, 80% is plastic waste and the remaining 20% are shards of glasses, cotton used for cleaning blood stains, etc.

The aim of installing the system is to disinfect the plastic waste, which can be sent for recycling. It will eventually help in generating revenue and also in controlling pollution.

Senior officials said that the staff at the hospital would soon be imparted training on how to use the microwave disinfection devise.

Senior officials at Nashik civil hospital expressed their gratitude to the MPCB for selecting the hospital for setting up the microwave disinfection device. The Nashik civil hospital has twice won the first prize of Kayakap Award in the state, under the guidance of civil surgeon Suresh Jagdale.

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan said the proposals in the state budget would help the state to take forward its development agenda through alternative plans.

The budget would help Kerala to tide over the acute financial crisis the country has slipped into. While doing so, the budget proposals would be able to give the much needed help to common man. “Consolidating the achievements the government was able to establish in the last three and a half years, the budget proposes plans to make further lofty achievements in agriculture, industrial and health sectors,” Vijayan said.

The budget, claimed the chief minister, reiterated the government’s focus on social welfare. Proposals for women, children and disabled people proved the same, he said.

“The alternative and people-centric policies of the state budget would appear clearer in the background of the worsening financial slowdown in the country and the defiant attitude of the Centre towards Kerala,” he said. The chief minister claimed that the coastal development package, Kuttanad, Wayanad and Idukki packages would help to narrow down the imbalances in development.

Vijayan also said the budget reflected the concern his government maintained towards the welfare of expatriates.

Bareilly: A two-storey building in Bareilly’s Baheri town was engulfed in flames on Friday night and destroyed. The fire is said to have broken out on the ground floor which houses a confectionery shop, probably due to a short circuit in the electrical equipment kept there.

It took nearly five hours for the fire department to douse the flames. Fire tenders were called in from Bareilly city and neighbouring Uttarakhand because the only tender in Baheri developed some technical snag and its pump stopped working during the operation.

Three persons, including a two-year-old girl, received minor burns due to the fire. The owner of the building lives on the first floor and runs a shop on the ground floor. He claimed that nearly Rs 2 lakh cash, 200 gm of gold jewellery and several household articles were completely destroyed, leading to a loss of nearly Rs 20 lakh.

According to Asif Raza, he was sleeping in his house in Shernaged locality of Baheri town when a strong smell of smoke woke him up. He found that a fire had broken out in the building and it was difficult to exit through the stairs. He along with his wife and two-year-old daughter jumped into the adjacent building. As a result, they all received minor injuries but their condition is stable.

Chief fire officer Chandra Mohan Sharma, said, “The family and local residents realized that a single fire tender alone could not douse the flames which had engulfed the entire building. We had to call more tenders to ensure that the flames were controlled. Fortunately, the fire did not spread to other buildings.”

He added, “The owner of the house was running a confectionary shop on the ground floor. We are yet to assess the total loss and the cause for the fire to break out in the building.”

Vadodara: A man from Anand fell prey to three tricksters on the busy RC Dutt Road in the posh Alkapuri area on Saturday afternoon after they hoodwinked him of US $10,000 and £5,000 by posing as customs officers.

The victim identified as Vijay Kalyani got down from an auto rickshaw near a petrol pump beside a prominent hotel and started walking towards Avanti Chambers in the lane beside the petrol pump. One of the three accused approached him and introduced himself as a sales tax officer. “He told the man that his senior officers are calling him,” said a police official, adding that the other accused requested Kalyani to allow them to check his bag.

When he agreed, one accused posing as the senior officer started checking the bag while the other two kept Kalyani busy in conversation. The accused siphoned off the packet containing the cash and returned the bag to Kalyani allowing him to leave the spot. Kalyani resumed his journey towards a money exchange office at Avanti Chambers when he suddenly became suspicious and opened the bag. To his horror, he found that the packet which contained the cash was missing. He quickly turned around to look for the trio, but the trickster trio vanished from the scene on their bikes.

Kalyani then alerted Hitendra Rathod, owner of the currency exchange office and called the police. Cops said that they are examining CCTV footage of traffic junctions and nearby shops to get more details about the accused.

“The complainant wanted to exchange the currency in Vadodara as he too is in the business of forex. We have taken his statement and are also talking to local shop owners or other eyewitnesses,” the police official said.

An offence was registered at Gotri police station late on Saturday night based on Kalyani’s complaint.

Under the ‘Brand Canada’ initiative of the chambers, Carlos Rojas-Arbulu, consul and head of trade and investment for Consulate General of Canada in Mumbai, said the purpose of the visit to Pune was to strengthen the links with the private sector in the city.

“The fact that there has been such accelerated growth in investments makes me think that the investment environment for companies in India is indeed good. However, there has to be predictability about the rules and they should not change frequently,” Rojas-Arbulu said.

He said Canada was ready to be the near-shore base for companies wishing to serve their clients in the US.

Pune: The city police have launched a probe to trace the identity of the person who had sent extortion emails to the Noble Hospital, demanding Rs10 lakh and issuing a threat of a bomb blast.

Suhas Bawache, deputy commissioner of police (zone V), told TOI, “We are conducting a technical investigation to establish the identity of the person responsible for sending the emails.”

Girish Bhosale, the hospital administrator, registered a complaint under sections 387 (putting a person under fear of death or of grievous hurt in order to commit extortion) and 506 (2) [criminal intimidation] of the Indian Penal Code at the Hadapsar police station on Friday night.

Dilip Mane, the medical director of Noble Hospital, said, “Around 5.50pm on Friday, we received an email from an unidentified person, demanding Rs10 lakh. The sender said if his demand was not met with, he would trigger a blast in such a manner that no loss would be caused to patients, but the reputation of the hospital would be tarnished.”

Mane said, “The email stated that patients would stop visiting the hospital to seek treatment. We had received similar emails on January 29 and 31, but did not respond to them. We have shared information with the police and lodged an FIR.”

He said, “One of the emails has a photograph of a clock, indicating a ticking bomb that could go off any moment. We found the contents of the emails to be vague and suspected it could be fake.”

The medical director of the hospital said, “The bomb detection and disposal team later pressed sniffer dogs into service, but nothing suspicious was found on the premises.”

Police are trying to trace the sender of the email and the motive behind the extortion bid.

147,['9/02/2020'],Number of international students signing up for Savitribai Phule Pune University courses drops,"This story is from February 9, 2020

Savitribai Phule Pune University.

PUNE: From 859 students in 2016-17, the number of international students signing up for courses at Savitribai Phule Pune University (SPPU) has decreased to 610 in 2019-20.

While the number of international women students has remained constant at around 200 every year, the male student population has decreased from 621 to 369 over the same period in conventional courses.

SPPU officials attributed the fewer number of students to a difference in the process of counting from 2018, a warlike situation in the Middleeast, stiff competition from the private sector and a trend of students choosing Bengaluru and other such places over Pune.

Vice-chancellor of SPPU Nitin Karmalkar said, “The number corresponds to the conventional courses, not professional courses, where we have foreign students. The admission to technical courses is done through the Directorate of Technical Education and hence, they have the data. The data corresponds with the single-window entry done through the International Centre at SPPU alone. Second, the data of an autonomous colleges has also not been counted since 2018 as they conduct their own admissions.”

Karmalkar also said the scenario is not rosy when it comes to international students and this applies across the country. “The tough visa norms, issues with Foreign Regional Registration Office, issues arising out of applying for a short visa when international students come to take admission before actually coming here for the course on student visa, etc, also cost us students. The conference (Destination India conference organized recently) was held to talk about resolving these issues. There is also a trend among international students of going to Bengaluru and Mysuru. Certain embassies also favour some institutes or destinations for a particular course.”

Mohammad Saif, a student activist working with foreign students, said, “The stipend they get from the government is delayed almost every month. This is a big issue for international students coming to the state universities. If the stipend is not received on time, it affects the students and the varsity’s image.”

HYDERABAD: Chaos erupted at GHMC ’s council meeting, on Saturday, over levying of penalties against those defacing walls and littering the city. Claiming that the civic body was unnecessarily harassing poor people and imposing hefty fines, AIMIM legislators and corporators demanded that the practice be stopped immediately. They also, collectively, called for the scrapping of the directorate of enforcement, vigilance and disaster management (GHMC), headed by an IPS officer.

The wing is responsible for enforcement and imposing of fines for civic offences, apart from spearheading rescue operations in times of disaster. Penalty for defacing city facade, range anywhere from Rs 1,000 to a few lakh of rupees.

“Poor are being troubled due to these heavy penalties,” said AIMIM MLC, Syed Amin Ul Hasan Jafri, as his party members took pot shots at the IPS officer — Viswajit Kampati, director, EVDM. “One single institute, was fined more than Rs four lakh ,” added AIMIM corporator from Akberbagh, Syed Minhajuddin

In his defence, Kampati said that the fines are a part of the GHMC act since years. “I did not draft them. EVDM is only implementing the existing act,” he added, even as TRS coporators joined in to oppose the fines. They, however, appreciated the role of disaster response teams. “I oppose the fines but the disaster response team’s work cannot be ignored especially during the rains,” said M Mamatha, TRS corporator from Gunfoundry.

GUWAHATI: Assam ’s BJP-led government will start conducting a socio-economic census from March this year to identify indigenous Muslims in the state.

Assam minorities development board chairman Muminul Aowal said the objective of the census was to segregate indigenous Muslims from migrants from erstwhile East Bengal , East Pakistan or Bangladesh .

The survey will mainly cover the Goria, Moria, Desi and the tea tribe Jolha communities, whom the government considers indigenous (like other ethnic tribes and communities of the state).

“The names of indigenous Muslims and Bangladeshi Muslims are the same. As a result, the government faces problems in identifying them du ring implementation of various welfare schemes. Since our government is committed towards the welfare of indigenous Muslims, they should have a separate identity,” he told TOI on Saturday.

Aowal said preparations for the census were at their final stages and hoped the exercise will commence “within this financial year”.

A meeting convened on February 11 by the state minorities development department with various stakeholders belonging to indigenous Muslim communities will set the ball rolling for the census, “which will be the first of its kind”, he added.

Jaipur: Rajasthan State Roadways Corporation (RSRTC) is hopeful that the 48 electric buses, which it plans to buy to operate between Jaipur and Delhi, will help the corporation earn healthy revenue. The Volvo buses, which currently operates in this route, are running into losses.

The corporation is currently facing a tough competition from trains like Jaipur-Delhi double decker, private bus operators and the low fare private taxis carrying passengers to Delhi.

This has compelled the administration to decrease the frequency of buses especially during weekdays when passengers’ load is affected.

TOI on Saturday spoke to various officials associated with the planning and operations of the super luxury buses on the Jaipur-Delhi route to know what are the factors affecting the income of the RSRTC buses on the this route.

A senior officer said, “First, many who have to visit Delhi and return on the same day prefer double decker which is a big factor. Second, since the buses to Delhi goes to Kashmiri Gate, it takes extra 90 minutes which becomes unfeasible for passengers. And these days private taxis plying from Narayan Singh circle from Jaipur to Delhi and from Rajiv Chowk (Gurugram) to Jaipur is also taking our passengers away.”

“We have conducted a survey at the Narayan Singh Circle to get an idea on how many private buses are operating to Delhi from this place and their load factor. We will write to the transport department on the number of buses we have noticed to find out if it is equivalent to the number of permits given on this route,” said UD Khan, managing director, RSRTC.

Senior RSRTC officers admitted that during weekdays they get merely five to 10 passengers in Volvo buses to New Delhi. “We get a good passengers load during the weekends but on weekdays it is little problematic,” said an officer.

From one micro-brewery in 2009, the city now has 12.

PUNE: Micro-brewers from the city and state are pushing for introduction of growlers so that patrons can enjoy craft beer in the comfort of their homes in the absence of bottling rights.

Patrons of craft beer have been asking micro-brewers about options to carry beer back home for consumption. The demand for craft beer has been growing steadily in the city over the last three years with more and more people opting for unique flavours and brews as against the regular bottled beer. From one micro-brewery in 2009, the city now has 12 micro-breweries, including some brew pubs and some solely distribution breweries.

Alongside the increasing demand for craft beer at brew pubs and restaurants, demand is also steadily growing for consumption of such beer at home.

“We have regular customers from Pune as well as tourists asking us on social media how they can take our brews back home. As there is no available option at the moment, we are pushing for introduction of growlers. Growlers are parcelled beer pitchers or a beer package that can be taken home for consumption within 48 hours,” said Nakul Bhosale , president of the Maharashtra chapter of Craft Brewers Association of India and founder of Great State Ale Works.

Bhosale stated that the association, which has 17 members in Maharashtra, has been working closely with the state excise department on the issue for nearly a year now.

“Growlers were recently introduced in Bengaluru after due permission from the government. However, they got permission for growlers only at the brewery level. We are looking at refills for growlers at restaurants and pubs. We are also suggesting standalone growler-filling stations,” he stated.

According to Bhosale, Maharashtra is the only state in the country that allows keg-based distribution system. “Due to this, craft brews have made their way to nearly 50 restaurants and bars in the city as against only brew pubs. While Pune was the first city in the country to have a micro-brewery a decade ago, we saw a slowdown soon after. The demand has been steadily increasing only in the last three years,” he explained.

Bhosale added that along with the micro-brewers from Karnataka, an association with two state chapters has been formed to take up various matters with the government. “We have been working with the government for a year on the issue of growlers and fine-tuned a lot of issues. But, with the change in government, we will have to start from scratch,” he added.

Speaking about craft beer, city-based entrepreneur Sakshi Jain said, ""From apple cider at Doolallys, wheat beers to pineapple fiction at Toit to Yavasura’s Indiam Pale Ale, we’ve come a long fruitful way from just wheat-based craft beers! I would prefer finely crafted beer over bottled commercial beer any day.""

A businessman from Pune, Prasanna Parmar, too, prefers craft beer over bottled beer.

""It’s good to try craft beers instead of bottled beer as they are fresh and there are multiple options to choose from to suit mood and taste,"" he said.

The IMD expects the minimum temperature in the city to be between 13°C and 15°C over the next few days

Pune: Partly cloudy skies and marginal increase in wind speed ensured chill to prevail in the air even as the city’s minimum temperature rose to 12.1°C on Saturday as against 10.1°C the previous day.

Anupam Kashyapi, head of weather at the India Meteorological Department, Pune, said, “The city witnessed a sudden change in wind pattern at 11.30pm on Friday, with development of some clouding thereafter. This caused the night temperature to rise to 12.1°C in Shivajinagar and 14.2°C in Lohegaon.” Pashan recorded a minimum temperature of 12.1°C.

The IMD said the minimum temperature in the city was expected to stay in the range of 13°C to 15°C over the next couple of days.

Kashyapi attributed the rise in the minimum temperature to clouding due to wind interaction/confluence over vast areas of Odisha, Chhatisgarh, Vidarbha and Telangana. “One branch of wind is coming from the Bay of Bengal carrying moisture. Another branch is passing in northeasterly direction from north Indian states and hence is cooler and contains relatively less moisture. This interaction over a large area has caused clouding with slight rise in minimum temperatures and possibility of trace to very light rains at isolated locations of Vidarbha, Mararthwada and south Madhya Maharashtra till Sunday morning,” Kashyapi said.

Day temperatures also remained on the lower side on Saturday. Shivajinagar recorded a day temperature of 28.6°C on Saturday, 2.6 degrees below normal, while Lohegaon’s day temperature was 28.4°C, 3.6 degrees below normal.

As per IMD forecast, generally cloudy skies to prevail in the city on Sunday, with haze at isolated places in the morning hours. It expects the minimum temperature to stay around 14°C. As for Monday, the Met department expects the minimum temperature to stay around 14°C.

160,['9/02/2020'],Fix fractured hip instead of total replacement: Study,"This story is from February 9, 2020

PUNE: Elderly people suffering from hip fractures should opt for partial replacement of the bony structure rather than total replacement as the latter could result in more dislocations after the surgery.

This has been revealed in a multi-centric global study conducted by noted surgeon Mohit Bhandari in association with the Pune-based Sancheti hospital. Bhandari, the professor and academic head of the division of orthopaedic surgery at McMaster University in Canada, stressed on this salient finding of the study during an exclusive interview to TOI when he visited the city last week.

“Our study has found that partial hip replacement is a better option in patients with hip fractures rather than total hip replacement (THR). The study has actually questioned the role of THR in patients with hip fractures,” Bhandari said.

For years, general consensus among surgeons had been in favour of THR, which is also an expensive treatment option.

“This is because it had shown very good results for hip arthritis. THR is one of the best surgeries for hip arthritis with excellent functional outcome,” Bhandari said.

“However, in our study, we found that patients who had undergone total hip replacement developed more complications, such as dislocations, after the surgery. Again, total hip replacement is more invasive, expensive and offers no additional functional benefit,” Bhandari said.

In countries like India where socio-economic factors play an important role in selection of the treatment plan, surgeons should offer treatment providing the best outcomes at the lowest possible cost, experts said.

“Hip fractures rank among the top 10 causes of disability among adults across the globe,” a medical expert said.

“Patients with a hip fracture are at considerable risk for health complications and reduced quality of life. Despite the high frequency of displaced fractures, the way this injury in elderly patients should be surgically managed, however, remains uncertain,” he said.

Cost should not be the only guiding criterion for the treatment plan as many other factors are to be considered while choosing the best option, he added.

In another multi-centric study, the Sancheti hospital played a key role and tested two different types of implants to fix the hip fractures.

“This study suggests that simple cancellous screws show better outcome for simple fractures. However, sliding hip screws might be needed in special cases like smokers or those with displaced fractures of the base femur neck ,” orthopaedic surgeon Parag Sancheti , the Sancheti hospital head, said.

“But again, this is another study that has given surgeons clear guidelines in treating these fractures,” Sancheti added.

Both these studies focused on trauma and that was also the objective of the Pune Trauma Course 2020 held on January 24 where Bhandari guided the surgeons about various modalities of treating hip fractures.

“The focus of this event was to update the surgeons with the latest evidence-based options to treat hip fractures. And both the studies can help the surgeons make informed decision and manage their patients better to ensure their wellbeing in the future,” Sancheti said.

The two studies, called FAITH and HEALTH, took years to be completed and were published in reputed medical journals, giving insights about the best possible treatment option for people suffering from hip fractures, leaving some even bed-ridden.

While FAITH was carried out between 2008 and 2014, HEALTH was carried out between 2009 and 2017.

161,['9/02/2020'],Pune: Women-only tours for ICC T20 World Cup,"This story is from February 9, 2020

THE SKIPPER: Harmanpreet Kaur

PUNE: March to Melbourne Cricket Ground to salute the ICC Women’s T20 World Cup finalists this March 8 — the International Women’s Day.

Going by the current form, Harmanpreet Kaur-led Women in Blue have high chance of taking the field on the second Sunday of this March and lift the Cup at the MCG (Melbourne Cricket Ground). Several travel companies in the city have announced woman-only tours to Australia for the ICC Women’s T20 World Cup. So, you can just be there.

The ICC Women’s T20 World Cup will tee off in Sydney on February 21.

As the Down Under is expecting at least five lakh Indians to travel for both the women’s and men’s tournament this year, tour organizers confirmed that they were witnessing a rise in booking from the Indian travellers to visit the women’s sporting event.

“We are seeing a rise in the demand of bookings from Pune to Australia ahead of the ICC Women’s T20 World Cup,” said Daniel D’souza, president and country head, Leisure SOTC Travels.

Nishant Kashikar, country manager, India and Gulf, Tourism Australia, said there was a lot of interest among the travel industry, the ICC official travel agents and hospitality agents for the ICC T20 Women and Men’s T20 World Cup. “Approximately 20 travel agents in the city have launched women-only tours for the ICC Women’s T20 World Cup,” he said.

“We are looking at an increased interest in the women-only tours and it is likely to pick up as the event draws closer,” added Kashikar.

Other firms also expect the bookings to rise as the event draws closer.

Tourism Australia had earlier started a #LedByWomen (or #LBW) campaign to up its ante to promote the ICC T20 Women’s World Cup.

Nikhil Thakurdas, the owner of the Odyssey Tours and Travels, told TOI that the success of the campaign was partially dampened by the recent bushfires in Australia.

“We are telling our prospective clients that the worst of the bushfires is behind us,” said Thakurdas.

In the ICC T20 Women’s World Cup, India are placed in Group A with hosts Australia, New Zealand, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh. The Group B comprises England, South Africa, the West Indies, Pakistan and Thailand.

Kaur-led India squad comprises big-hitter Veda Krishnamurthy, Bengal’s rookie batter Richa Ghosh and 15-year-old Shafali Verma.

Opener Smriti Mandhana has been named Kaur’s deputy for the tournament, which begins with India taking on the hosts in Sydney on February 21.

162,['9/02/2020'],Consumer court in M’nagar issues notices to online tutoring firm &amp; Shah Rukh Khan,"This story is from February 9, 2020

Muzaffarnagar: A consumer court in Muzaffarnagar has issued notice to a Bangalore-based online tutoring firm and also to its brand ambassador Shah Rukh Khan seeking their responses on a petition alleging breach of trust by the company.

The complainant, Joginder Kumar, had filed the petition in Muzaffarnagar’s consumer forum claiming that he had purchased a tablet and software from the online tutoring firm for his son a few months ago.

“I subscribed to the app-based e-learning software for my son, who is studying in Class 9. It had a clause saying that if the client is not satisfied with the course, the fees will be refunded,” Kumar said in the complaint, adding, “We were not satisfied with the product and filed for a refund. But, the company didn’t respond in spite of several reminders.”

Kumar also made the Bollywood actor a party in the case.

“A seasoned actor like Shah Rukh Khan promoting the App only adds credibility to the product. So the actor is also responsible if the company cheats,” he added.

Kumar’s lawyer, Abhinav Agrawal, said, “Our complaint against the company and actor Khan has been accepted by the court. It has issued notices to them.”

Telling more about the case, Kumar said, “The company representatives had visited my son’s school in October last year and gave a demo of the tab to students.

“Later, they also contacted me and asked to buy this tab with in-build learning software. They also came to my home and convinced us that this tab will help clear all doubts of various subjects and assured us that money will be refunded if we didn’t like the gadget.”

According to Kumar’s lawyer, he paid Rs 40,000 for the product.

Days after purchasing the tab, Kumar contacted the company and complained about the gadget and asked for a refund, he said. ""But, the company’s representatives kept on making excuses. They didn’t refund the money,” the lawyer said.

“It was then that we approached the court,” he said.

After issuing notices, the court has fixed March 24 as the next date of hearing.

In November last year, a youth had complained against an ointment firm and its two brand ambassadors. The consumer court had slapped a fine of Rs 20,000 on the firm and two actors who promoted it.

163,['9/02/2020'],"National Lok Adalat settles19,644 cases","This story is from February 9, 2020

Nashik: The District Legal Service Authority (DLSA) resolved 19,644 cases , most of them criminal, through the National Lok Adalat in various courts across Nashik district on Saturday.

According to the DLSA, 58 benches were constituted under the command of chief district and sessions judge Abhay Waghwase, who is also the president of DLSA, which saw a revenue of Rs 24.93 crore change hands.

The cases included the ones related to recovery of money, electricity bills, land acquisition, Motor Accidents Claims Tribunals (MACT), matrimonial disputes and Negotiable Instruments Act.

The Lok Adalat presents an excellent opportunity for two parties — either two people fighting over some issues or if some government agencies are involved — to arrive at a mean position and exchange the settlement amount to close the case, instead of fighting it out in court.

“Two parties can iron out their differences either at the pre-litigation level or even when the trial is pending and arrive at an amicable solution in front of the members of the judiciary. Thereafter, they lose the right to challenge the settlement,” said DLSA secretary Prasad Kulkarni.

Of the 1.17 lakh cases, 19,644 (16.8%) were resolved. The highest numbers of cases were related to criminal compoundable ones as 746 of the 3,688 were resolved. This was followed by 549 cases out of 10,554 of the MSEDCL that were taken up while 509 out of 3355 cases of the NI Act were resolved.

An amount of Rs 10.07 crore was realised in the settlement of the recovery cases, Rs 6.52 crore in cases related to NI Act, Rs 3.69 crore was settled in the MSEDCL cases, among others.

Bijnor: A day after hundreds of Dalits threatened to convert to Christianity after they were denied permission to re-start Sant Ravidas Jayanti Yatra, senior officials, including district magistrate (DM) Ramakant Pandey and superintendent of police (SP) Sanjeev Tyagi, rushed to Shyamiwala village and asked them to observe the procession peacefully.

Shyamiwala has 30% Hindu population, which houses close to 200 Dalit families.

Notably, the Dalit community has claimed that the procession was stopped during the previous SP government.

Talking to TOI, Pandey said, “We had a meeting with villagers at Shyamiwala on Saturday. We have asked all the villagers to observe Sant Ravidas Jayanti peacefully. If anyone tries to spoil the peace, strict action will be taken against him.”

On being asked about the procession scheduled for February 9, the DM said, “We have taken stock of the situation here, which has been found normal. We are mulling over the issue. It will be decided by late-night whether the procession will be carried out or not in the village. ”

However, a press note released by the police department indicated that the procession may be taken out.

“A meeting was held here at Shyamiwala village to carry out the procession peacefully,” the press note said.

However, apprehensions and speculations over Sant Ravidas Shobha Yatra continued. According to a villager, Sanjeev Kumar, “The DM and the SP came here and held a meeting. They asked us to celebrate the festival peacefully. But, they did not make it clear whether the permission has been given to take out the procession or not.”

It is notable that on Friday also a meeting was held here atcollectorate and dalits of the same village had handed a memorandum to administration and threatened that if procession is not allowed in the village, hundreds of dalit will embrace Christianity.”

Jaipur: The city police are still questioning the two youths who were detained on Friday after a teen died following an assault from his co-worker three days back.

Till now, the police have not found anything against the two detained youths. The main accused was arrested on Friday after the teenager succumbed to injuries on late Thursday night. The 17-year-old Basit Khan worked as a waiter for a catering company in Jaipur and was punched in the head by his co-worker over an argument over opening the door of their vehicle while returning from work on the night of February 4.

Deputy inspector general of police Ashok Gupta said, “We have detained the two youths and are questioning them but till now there is no indication of their involvement in the matter. However, we are also not giving them a clean chit till it is absolutely certain that they were not involved.”

Basit hailed from Kupwara’s Kunan village in Kashmir and is said to be the son of an Army soldier who died a few years back. Following his death, police arrested the co-worker, Aditya Kumar (24) who fatally punched him and detained two others.

According to the complainant, the brawl started over unlocking the door of the vehicle which was supposed to take the catering staff back after an event in Harmada police station area. The accused and the victim got into an argument following which Aditya slapped and punched Basit. The accused punched him several times on his head and when the victim returned home, he complained of severe headache and started vomiting. His friends took him to SMS Hospital where the doctors operated on him but he died due to serious head injury. His uncle arrived from Kupwara and took the body back home on Friday itself.

PANAJI: The Airports Authority of India (AAI) and Indian Navy have decided on air space segregation at the upcoming greenfield airport at Mopa . The decision, which has been conveyed to the state government, will have to be approved by the Centre.

Director of civil aviation Suresh Shanbhogue told TOI that it has been agreed that AAI will control the air traffic control (ATC) tower at Mopa. He also said that obtaining defence clearance for the airport would be left to the AAI and Indian Navy.

The state cabinet on Thursday extended the September 2020 deadline that was set for the completion of the airport by 20 months, owing to delays caused by litigation.

A senior government official said that as per the new deadline, the infrastructure at the airport will have to be completed by December 2021 and that operations would begin by May 2022.

He said that it takes at least six months to get permission and clearances to start operations once the infrastructure is in place. The government had signed the concession agreement with GMR Goa for developing the airport on a public-private partnership basis on November 8, 2016.

The three-year construction period of phase I began on September 4, 2017, with the commercial operations date fixed on September 3, 2020. The state government had appointed Engineers India Ltd, a government of India entity, to supervise the project’s progress.

Chief minister Pramod Sawant , in a written reply to the state legislative assembly, said that due to the delay, the cost of phase-1 of the airport is likely to increase beyond the Rs 1,900 crore earlier estimated.

The Supreme Court, which had ordered a status quo on the airport, lifted the ban on January 16, thereby allowing construction to continue.

168,['9/02/2020'],Panchavati Express to get new LHB coach in five months,"This story is from February 9, 2020

Panchavati Express.

NASHIK: Commuters travelling by the Panchavati Express , who have been raising the pitch for the new Linke Hofmann Busch (LHB) coaches for over one-and-a-half years, have strongly expressed their dissatisfaction with the Cenral Railways for failing to meet their demand and instead installing the updated LHB coaches in Indrayani Express.

From February this year, commuters taking the Indrayani Express to travel between Pune and Mumbai are said to be having a comfortable train journey—thanks to the new LHB coaches.

The LHB coaches have been designed in a way so that there can be an enhancement of accommodation capacity to benefit passengers. Moreover, passengers travelling in these coaches will feel more comfort during the train journey.

Though Panchavati Express (running between Manmad junction in Nashik and Mumbai) was the first to get the LHB coaches on May 1 , 2018, it has still not been equipped with the new coaches.

“The new LHB coaches in Indrayani Express have all the facilities that we have been demanding for Panchavati Express. Yet the Central Railways is not paying heed to our demands,” said Rajesh Fokne, a former member of the Divisional Railway Users Consultative Committee (DRUCC).

Ever since the LHB coaches were introduced for Panchavati Express, regular travellers have been complaining against the bad ergonomics of the coach. Besides making travelling an arduous journey, the less number of windows and their uneven planning add to the discomfort of the commuters. As a result, commuters have developed acute neck and back pain.

Krian Borse, a regular traveller said, “The little space between the chairs aligned in one direction allows passengers little acesss to the aisle.”

The new LHB coaches in Indrayani Express have better ergonomics with seats facing each other, properly aligned windows which enhances the ventilation in the coaches, among a host of other facilities.

“The new coach has 40 windows against the 30 per coach in Panchavati Express. Built by Modern Coach Faction (MCF), Raebareli, the coach can seat 120 passengers, against the capacity of 96 passengers in the old coaches,” said Devraj Malekar, a frequent traveller between Nashik and Mumbai.

Officials in the Central railways said that the new LHB coach would be installed in Panchavati Express in the next four to five months.

Janta clinic at Azad Nagar in city

JAIPUR: The city got two more janta clinics — one at Eidgah Colony and another at Azad Nagar, as health minister Raghu Sharma inaugurated them on Saturday. The state government is aiming at setting up 100 such janta clinics in the state. As of now, 12 more janta clinics are ready for inauguration in Jaipur and three in Jodhpur. These clinics are planned with an aim to bring a transformation in healthcare in the state.

On the lines of Delhi’s Mohalla Clinics, the first Janta Clinic of the state was inaugurated in Valmiki Nagar on December 18 on the completion of one-year of the government.

To add more such clinics in the city, the health minister inaugurated one Janta clinic at Van Vihar of Eidgah Colony and the other was dedicated to the people in slum area of Azad Nagar. Chief minister Ashok Gehlot, in his budget speech 2019-20, had announced such clinics in different parts of the state. But, with the financial year coming to an end soon, the state government has managed to inaugurate only three Janta clinics till Saturday. However, according to the health department sources, two more clinics will be inaugurated in the city — one in Topkhane ka Rasta and the other at Jalupura Park, which will increase the tally to five.

“The important part in Janta Clinics is that it is paperless. The data of patients is kept intact. For the next visit, a patient will have to give his reference number as the data is already available at the clinic. Based on the data, a health card will be issued to the patients,” said Sharma, after inaugurating the clinics.

Health department’s additional chief secretary Rohit Kumar Singh said, “On the first day, the OPD at Van Vihar colony registered 149 patients and 114 were registered at Azad Nagar.”

However, in Jodhpur, three clinics are ready for inauguration. Among the three, one is located at Ayurveda Hospital Bhawan near Mandore railway station, another at Baiji Ka Talab in a municipal corporation census centre and the third one in a school building at Masuriya. The clinics are planned in such as a way that all the three Jodhpur’s assembly constituencies — Sardarpura, Jodhpur city, Soorsagar — get equal share.

Each clinic will have an OPD chamber, medicine counter, patient waiting area and a drug distribution counter. According to the health department officials, more than 300 drugs for free distribution to the patients are made available at Janta Clinics, which has facilities for referral of patients where a medical officer, two nurses, one lady health worker, pharmacist and a grade IV employee will be at the service.

VADODARA: Heritage Trust, Vadodara and Alavi Bohra community will be jointly organising a heritage walk on Sunday to highlight the Alavi Bohra heritage of the city.

Participants will have an opportunity to have a look at the old Mohalla culture which dates back to almost 550 years.

The heritage walk will begin from Badri Mohalla , Wadi at 5.30 pm. A similar walk highlighting heritage of Alavi Bohra community, a faction of Ismailism, was also organised in the year 2015 during heritage week celebrations.

“Alavi Bohra community have settled in Vadodara almost 550 years ago when the city was just confined within the four gates. The city was not even named Vadodara in those times and the gates were built much later,” said Dr Zulqarnain Bhaisaheb , who is documenting community’s history.

“We have a mosque in our locality – Fakhri masjid at Fakhri mohalla between Mandvi and Gendi gate which dates back to 400 years,” he said.

Sunday’s heritage walk is all about taking a look in and around old city of Vadodara for which 35 participants have already registered.

“The walk will start from community’s main masjid at Badri mohalla after which the participants will be taken for a tour to three old houses which are almost 75 to 90 years old. Also, the participants will see how Bohra topi is made,” he said.

The participants will also have dinner in Bohra style where seven people sit together to have their dinner from a single big dish known as ‘thaal’. “They will dine the Bohra cuisine with both vegetarian and non-vegetarian food items,” he said, adding that the heritage walk this time is more focused on ethnic eating style.

171,['9/02/2020'],Aspirants mortgaged property to pay for fake academy’s fee of Rs 1.80L,"This story is from February 9, 2020

Agra: Most of the students of the fake maritime academy , ‘Offshore Shipping’, mortgaged their parental property to pay a hefty fee of Rs 1.80 lakh to enroll for a four-month course to train as high sea sailors. Now, left high and dry with certificates not recognized anywhere, they have no idea as to how they can recover their money.

The fake academy had been functioning near NH-2 since 2013. Since then, more than 300 aspiring sailors have enrolled in it. All the “students”, primarily from weaker sections of society, hailed from Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Gujarat, Jharkhand, Haryana, Punjab and Chhattisgarh. A couple of students were from backward eastern districts of UP. Most of them paid the fee in cash. A few paid by cheque, which helped police to build a strong case against the fake academy kingpin, Zulfikar Ahmad, 30, and his aides, Dinesh Kumar, 52, and his son, Lokesh Kumar, 25. Police suspect there are nearly 12 people who are associated with the fake academy and lured the victims to join it by spreading news about it word of mouth and placing fake advertisements .

The modus operandi of the gang was simple. After the declaration of intermediate results by various state education boards, the gang would make calls to gullible students who scored less marks and lived in far off villages, mostly outside UP.

The racket came to light after some duped aspirants contacted police as their certificates were not accepted at any job interview.

An FIR was lodged by one of the victims, Rakesh, 24, from Jalore district of Rajasthan. He said, “They contacted me on phone and offered to get me a job in a foreign-based shipping company if I attended their four-month maritime course. Before joining the academy, I paid Rs 70,000 as initial fee. Since I hail from a poor family, my parents had to mortgage a part of our farmland to raise the money for course fee.”

It was only after he joined the academy that he found he and others had been duped as the claims of having an accreditation from Government of India and an Australian maritime institute were false.

Mayank Tiwari of Lalitpur in eastern Uttar Pradesh said, “My parents paid Rs 1.60 lakh after selling their property so that I could join a shipping course and get a job later.”

According to police, as the gang was charging less fee than any other maritime institutes, many jobless youth joined the fake academy. “We believe in over the past seven years, more than 300-500 students were duped, from whom the gang charged Rs 1.80 lakh as fee,” said Saurabh Dixit, additional superintendent of police.

Mritunjay Verma, owner of Kaushalpura-based complex from which the fake academy was being run, never suspected anything amiss as the rennt was paid on time.

Jaipur: The forest department officials have complained about a sandalwood tree being chopped off and its wood stolen from city’s Ramniwas Bagh. The tree was stolen 10 days back but the case was lodged on Friday. Last year in July, two sandalwood trees were reported stolen from the same place, though the police could not find the accused. In the latest case, the security guard at the Ramniwas Bagh is being questioned.

Mahesh Tiwari (DCF), JDA, said, “Ramniwas Bagh has lots of trees and it was established with the intent so can people gain knowledge about flora and fauna. Sandalwood trees were also planted decades ago and around ten days back one of the oldest one was chopped and the wood stolen. Last year in July, two sandalwood trees had been stolen but no accused were found.”

According to official, sandalwood fetches a price of Rs 10,000 per kg in the market and the three trees stolen are valued in crores. “When I discovered that the tree has been chopped, I realised that it has to be an inside job as someone from outside cannot just come inside and take the tree. Also the person I suspected was living beyond his means. For ten days, we did an internal investigation following which I lodged the case. Now it is up to the police to find the culprit.”

BAREILLY: Appealing to the opposition to launch a massive protest against Citizen Amendment Act (CAA), proposed National Register of Citizens (NRC) and National Population Register (NPR), Sunni Barelvi cleric Maulana Tauqeer Raza Khan on Saturday alleged that Samajwadi Party, Bahujan Samaj Party and other small secular outfits have entered into compromise with Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh and these parties feel that whatever government is doing is fine.

“Akhilesh Yadav ( SP leader) is a politician only on twitter and is not active elsewhere. Similar is the condition of Mayawati (BSP chief). The country needs active opposition. If these parties want to contest elections in future, they should stand against the oppression of the ruling party. They should hit the road to stage protests against it, otherwise public will not support them in polls,” said Khan, national president, Ittehad-e-Millat Council (IMC).

Claiming that he will conduct mass protest at every level if the government does not roll back CAA, NRC and NPR, Khan said, “We are not against population survey but we are opposing the implementation of NPR along with NRC. We are against new information which will be sought in NPR.”

AGRA: Based on the orders of the state government, the regional transport officials have started issuing notices to all schools in the city for the installation of CCTV cameras and vehicle tracking systems in all buses transporting students.

According to transport department officials, schools have been asked to make the necessary arrangements within 20 days. They added that vehicle permits of buses that don’t comply to the directive would be cancelled apart from initiating legal action against the driver concerned.

At present, 1,000 school vehicles are registered with the regional transport office in Agra.

The state transport directorate had recently made CCTVs and VTS mandatory in school buses to ensure safety. The CCTVs would be connected with the VTS to allow real-time monitoring of the speed, location and activities inside the vehicle. An e-challan would be automatically generated in case of speeding.

Regional transport officer AK Singh said, “Notices are being issued to the managements of all schools in the city. They have been asked to install CCTV cameras and VTS in school buses within 20 days failing which the vehicle will be considered unfit. Strict action will be taken against the erring drivers too.”

In the recent years, the human resources ministry had directed the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) to issue revised guidelines making it mandatory for school buses to have GPS, CCTVs and speed governors to ensure safety of children. This was done in the aftermath of the school bus accident near Etah that killed over 10 children and injured scores of others when their vehicle collided with a lorry. The CBSE circular had also said that the school management and the head of the school would be held responsible for any lapse.

Last year, UP State Road Transport Corporation (UPSRTC) had also mooted a proposal to install CCTVs in close to 700 roadways buses plying on three most accident-prone routes of the state. The routes are Lucknow-Delhi via Agra (expressway), Lucknow-Delhi via Bareilly and Lucknow-Gorakhpur via Ayodhya. The move was to get ‘evidence, sequence and reason’ of accidents and discipline drivers. The UPSRTC was also sanctioned Rs 2 crore for the same from the Road Safety Fund.

Tribal protesters blocked highway, burnt tyres to obstruct traffic flow

Vadodara: In separate FIRs filed in Chhota Udepur, 13 individuals along with a mob of around 100 persons were booked for unlawful assembly and blocking roads using trees and burning tyres during the bandh call demonstrations on Friday.

The tribals of the region were protesting in demand for inclusion of Rathwa community in the OBC category.

According to police, the demonstrators had blocked the highway connecting Madhya Pradesh and Vadodara, roads near Tejgadh and Zoz outposts and Sihod Chowkdi in Pavi Jetpur on Friday afternoon. According to police, the protesters had blocked the traffic by felling trees and burning tyres.

At all four locations, the protesters fled seeing police approaching the site but cops could identify 13 protesters. No arrests have been done yet. Although police have booked all for unlawful assembly, no violence were reported in any part of the district.

On Friday, the community had observed a bandh following which shops and business establishments across the district including Chhota Udepur town remained closed. Post offices, banks and even milk dairies downed their shutters as well.

The community has been protesting since 2018 as the revenue records mention members of the community as ‘Koli’ or ‘Koli Rathwa’ which brings them under the Other Backward Classes (OBC) community and the community members want themselves to be recognized as tribal. In the past, both Congress and BJP leaders from the community had shared dais in connection with the same issue.

AGRA: On Day 26 of their indefinite strike, traders of Sanjay Place market organized “Jan Sansad” (public parliament) to protest against the Agra Municipal Corporation (AMC) decision to levy of parking fee at the market. Playing the role of an MLA and an MP, two traders took over the dais at the dharna spot in the parking space replied to the questions raised by the audience in the negative and against public welfare.

Responding to a question, one of the “public representative to Delhi” said, “Protest are taking place throughout the country, but they hardly make any difference. Your job is to stage protest and our job is to ignore them.”

Since January 14, traders of Sanjay Place have been sitting on an indefinite strike against AMC’s decision to introduce parking fee at 38 places at the market area. The protesters claimed that it violates norms as they had already paid a one-time parking fee at the time of purchasing the property.

Hiren Agarwal, secretary of the market association, said, “We are not going to tolerate AMC administration’s dictatorial decisions at any cost. The parking mafia will not be allowed to operate in Sanjay Place.”

The dispute over parking fees between Sanjay Place traders and AMC is sub-judice. Traders want AMC to cancel parking contracts till the court delivers its verdict in the matter.

Association's treasurer Vinay Mittal said, “We have received the support of over two dozen organizations in our protest against the parking mafia.” Mittal alleged the AMC had allowed people associated with BJP to collect parking fee. “The parking mafia is in collusion with AMC officials. In the past, we have raised the matter with mayor Naveen Jain, but no solution was provided,” he added.

CHENNAI: The Directorate of Vigilance and Anti-Corruption ( DVAC ) has slapped a corruption case on 14 officials from the Tamil Nadu police’s telecommunication branch and two private firms based on allegations of irregularities in the purchase of mobiles, CCTV systems, tablet PCs, GPS, CCTV camera and battery for VHF sets from 2016 to 2018.

On Saturday, searches were carried out at 18 places, including the residence and office of the suspected officials and private individuals, an official release from the agency said.

The suspected scam was first brought to light by TOI in September last year after which the then home secretary Niranjan Mardi ordered a DVAC probe into the irregularities. This was after an initial inquiry by the DGP’s office showed prima facie irregularities and misconduct by certain officials, including SP (technical) M Anbuchezhian.

“Some incriminating materials have been seized during the search,” the DVAC said on Saturday. Sources said searches were carried out at the residences of Anbuchezhian and his deputy, additional SP Ramesh. DVAC officially stated that the preliminary inquiry showed that this had caused a huge loss to the government.

The total worth of tenders under scrutiny by DVAC is likely to be around Rs 300 crore , sources said. According to his own Linkedin profile, Anbuchezhian has been in the same post since 2013.

He is part of tender scrutiny committees which decide on the eligibility of companies which bid for police modernisation equipment like digital mobile radio (DMR) systems, APCO, CCTVs and related electronic items.

Documents available with TOI showed that a particular company was favoured in most of the tenders and that there would be only one bidder for the tenders. Documents also showed that Anbuchezhian had overruled concerns raised by senior officials in tender deliberations.

Incidentally, a month after TOI’s report, ADGP (technical services) in the DGP’s office released a press note rubbishing the allegations of corruption and stating that all purchases by the department had been carried out with strict adherence to procedures prescribed under the TN Transparency in Tenders Act.

Green move: Workers segregate plastic from the waste dumped at Pachanady

MANGALURU: The Mangaluru City Corporation (MCC) has found a new way to fight growing plastic pollution , by appointing an agency to segregate plastic from the landfill, for recycling.

The MCC appointed Nature Friendly Recycle Industries and Dry Waste Handling to segregate plastic from the waste dumped at Pachanady and recycle it in factories. The project which was started on a pilot basis, yielded good results.

The agency has been segregating an average of 27-28 tonnes of plastic every day. The city, with 60 wards, has been generating an average of 350 tonnes of waste every day. The industry has been segregating the plastic for recycling, and they are also exporting it to foreign countries, said MCC environment engineer Madhu S Manohar.

“They have invested nearly Rs 50 lakh to install all the machinery necessary to process the waste, including pet bottles, plastic carry bags, packing bags, plastic waste, oil packets and other plastic items at our landfill in Pachanady. The move not only reduces MCC’s burden, but also fetches revenue, as the agency is paying the city corporation for the plastic collected from waste. They have been paying Rs 100 for each ton of plastic collected from the landfill. In addition, they are also paying rent for the premises and electricity charges,” Manohar said.

Moreover, he said it is an eco-friendly initiative, and that plastic items will not be thrown into landfills any more. More companies are showing interest in collecting plastic from waste to recycle it, Manohar said.

Workers of the company segregate and collect all plastic items in the first phase, and later it is cleaned using a dust removal machine. A shredder is used to cut plastic waste items into shreds, and it is compressed using a hydraulic automatic pressing machine. Recently, they exported 100 tonnes of crushed bottles to Netherlands, and they have been sending plastic lumps to various recycling companies in India, he added.

AHMEDABAD: Even as concerns and insecurity about proof of one's nationality are rife in the wake of protests raging over the Citizenship Amendment Act and the National Register of Citizens , imagine if your birth certificate has ""Pakistan"" in your address line!

A family in Vatva area of the city is distressed after the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation issued a birth certificate of their 18-month-old son with residence address mentioning ""Pakistan railway crossing"" as a landmark.

The crossing in the area is informally referred to as ""Pakistan crossing"" as it is near a Muslim-dominated locality housing around 2,200 families referred as ""Chhota Pakistan"". The area is officially called ""Vasant Gajendragadkar Nagar EWS Housing"" named after the state's first general secretary of the Jan Sangh Party in Gujarat. The infant's family suspects that this reference has inadvertently cropped into official documentation.

Mohammed Uzerkhan, the 18-month-old boy of Arbazkhan Pathan and Mahekbanu Pathan , was born on October 1, 2018. The family lives in Char Maliya Society near Vatva railway crossing. Shaleha Bibi Pathan , grandmother of the child, collected his birth certificate from a civic centre on February 3.

However, when the family read the certificate carefully they were shocked to see ""Near Pakistan Railway Station"" mentioned as a landmark in their address. Talking to TOI , she said, ""After the enactment of CAA and talks of NRC , we are making frantic efforts to get our records in place. We tried to get it rectified at the civic centre but nobody paid any heed to us. So, we rushed to the office of the Danilimda Congress councillor Badruddin Shaikh.""

Bhavin Joshi, who is in charge of the office of Registrar of Births and Deaths, said the aggrieved parents have been asked to visit the office on Monday and after verifying their documents, due correction would be made.

188,['9/02/2020'],MSEZ stares down barrel with steep hike in water tariff,"This story is from February 9, 2020

A file pic of MSEZ.

MANGALURU: Mangalore Special Economic Zone (MSEZ) is staring at closure . With industrial offtake in MSEZ limited to ONGC Mangalore Petrochemicals Ltd, five other units and more than 300 acres yet to be allotted, a recent move by the state government to hike water tariff for industrial use 100 times has come as a body blow to MSEZ. Tariff that was Rs 1,800/mcft was hiked to Rs 1.5-lakh/mcft and after protestations pared to Rs 1lakh/mcft.

Following a May 28, 2018 order for water drawn from dams and reservoirs, the tariff has been revised from the previous Rs 3,200/mcft to Rs 300,000/mcft across industries. For water drawn from natural sources, it has been revised to Rs 150,000/mcft across industries from Rs 1,800/mcft earlier.

A top MSEZ source, privy to the development, told STOI that the tariff for the latter category on which it is dependent has since been reduced to Rs 1 lakh/mcft.

Saying that this hike will make operations at MSEZ unviable, the sources said the annual water bill that MSEZ used to foot was Rs 28 lakh, which has now jumped to Rs 24 crore.

Wondering how industries in the present economic scenario of slowdown and with bank lending too having come to a standstill, will cope with the situation, the sources said, “MSEZ has borrowed to create infrastructure in the SEZ. How can we repay this amount unless industries set shop?”

Existing units at MSEZ – four fish surmi units, Cardolite and OMPL are yet to fully establish themselves. Against 1,620 acres notified for MSEZ and only 1,000 acres available for commercial exploitation, the source pointed out that MSEZ is yet to lease out 300 acres.

OMPL alone accounts for 450 acres allotted, and the remaining units are set on 250 acres. These units will not be able to sustain this steep hike in water tariff, the source said.

The source pointed out that with power tariff too set for revision as Mescom tariff filing for 2020-21 is coming up for hearing on February 13, this will effectively kill any entrepreneurship that one expected to thrive at MSEZ.

“MSEZ has distribution license inside the zone, but KERC decides at what price we must purchase power from Mescom. This even though MSEZ is the single biggest customer for the electricity distribution company,” the source said.

Incidentally, it is not just the MSEZ that has raised red flags on this water tariff issue. Even Karnataka Iron and Steel Association as well as other affected manufacturers have appealed to the state government for an immediate rollback of the tariff revision. In Tamil Nadu or a drought-stricken state like Rajasthan, the rates are Rs 14,000-Rs 20,000/mcft, the source said, assailing the tariff order that Krishna Bhagya Jala Nigam Ltd mooted.

INDORE: Good news for doctors posted in tribal areas of Madhya Pradesh as they would now be getting extra allowance than their urban counterpart. State government has launched CM Susheshan Medical Officers appreciation scheme to pay incentive allowances along with salary to medical officers to ensure their presence at health institutions in tribal areas. An order in this regard was sent to CMHOs of 20 districts with tribal population to implement it.

The government under the scheme decided to pay allowance ranging from Rs40,000 to Rs 75,000 to permanent and contractual medical officers and specialist working in primary health centres and community health centres in identified areas along with existing salaries. The allowances will be paid to all contractual and permanent doctors posted in those health facilities in identified 89 backward blocks in 20 districts including Chindwara, Betul, Dindori, Dhar, Khanwa, Alirajpur, Khargone, Barwani, Siwni, Shahdol, Umaria, Annuppur and Ratlam.

The government decided to pay Rs40,000, Rs50,000 and Rs, 75,000 as incentive allowance to medical officers, specialist(diploma) and specialist(degree) respectively to permanent and contractual doctors.

Welcoming the decision, state medical officers association general secretary Dr Madhav Hasani said, “This is the first time, when the government has thought about permanent medical officers already working in backward district.”

“We can hope that this step of government will attract more doctors to state for working in rural areas,” said Hasani.

VC Nomani urged women protesting in Deoband to end the protest in the wake of Union home ministry's clarificat... Read More

MEERUT: Hundreds of students at renowned Islamic seminary Darul Uloom, Deoband held a protest and demanded resignation of their vice chancellor Abul Qasim Nomani over his alleged appeal to Muslim women to call off the anti-CAA protest. The students’ protest was held at the seminary campus on late Friday evening, prompting the VC to issue a clarification and disassociate himself from the remark.

VC Nomani said, “I reached out to the agitating students and cleared the confusion over my remark. The issue was immediately resolved.”

It all started when a video of VC Nomani, speaking at local peace committee meeting, went viral on Friday. In the video clip, Nomani could be heard purportedly urging women protesting at Eidgah ground in Deoband to end the protest in the wake of Union home ministry’s clarification on NRC.

It triggered widespread criticism with many on social media taking potshots at the VC Nomani’s statement.

The protests prompted the VC to issue a press release.

“The video is in fact a clip of meeting held by district administration regarding peace in Deoband. I was also part of this. But, I never issued such a statement. My opinion is being wrongly twisted. Darul Uloom, Deoband has not issued any appeal to end the country-wide protests,” he said in the release.

The late night protest by students sent the local administration into a tizzy. Police was also on alert though senior officials refrained to comment on it claiming it to be the “internal matter” of the institution.

194,['9/02/2020'],"Polls in 55 cantonments, including Deolali, deferred","This story is from February 9, 2020

Nashik: The Ministry of Defence (MoD) has deferred elections in 55 cantonment boards across the country.

Officials said the ministry will now release a fresh date for the elections.

Of these 55 cantonment boards, seven are in Maharashtra — Deolali (Nashik), Aurangabad, Ahmednagar, Pune, Khadki, Dehu Road and Kamptee (Nagpur).

Deputy director of MoD Rajesh Kumar Shah, in a written communiqué on February 5, informed the General Officer Commanding-in-Chief (GOC-in-C) about the ministry’s decision. The letter cited “administrative” reasons.

“The term of office of all elected members of these cantonment boards has been extended for six months, or till the date of the constitution of the Board, whichever is earlier,” read the MoD communiqué.

Elections in these 55 cantonment boards, which last took place in 2014, were slated for this month. In fact, Cantonment Board, Deolali (CBD) had already started preparations for elections in the eight seats. It had recently conducted a lottery to reserve three seats for women candidates as per instructions from the MoD in November.

Ajay Kumar, the CEO of CBD, told TOI that the board has decided not to proceed with the poll preparations given the latest instruction from the MoD.

“We will restart the poll preparation work after we receive the green signal to do so from the ministry,” Kumar said.

Elected members of the CBD said they are happy that the MoD had extended their tenure. CBD vice-president Bhagwan Katariya said the feedback he has received suggested six other cantonment boards are due for elections in June this year.

“It is possible that the MoD is planning to organise simultaneous polls in 61 cantonment boards simultaneously in June. That is perhaps why elections in 55 boards were deferred,” Kataria said.

Prabhavati Dhiware, another elected member of the CBD, said an extension to her tenure meant she will now get some more time to finish pending projects.

“We have been waiting for funds to build a community hall in Ward No. 1. We also need a dialysis machine at the cantonment hospital. We will try to ensure that funds for the projects reach us before the election,” Dhiware said.

Another elected member of CBD, Baburao Mojad said even new projects can be planned by existing members due to extensions of their tenures.

195,['9/02/2020'],Akash bats for people affected in demolition drive on MGM campus,"This story is from February 9, 2020

Indore: The stage was set for another ‘ballebazi’ by MLA Akash Vijayvargiya on Saturday on MGM Medical College campus during an ongoing encroachment removal drive meant to pave way for proposed development work. But the ‘batsman’ even after ‘padding up’ for another show of strength showed restraint this time and ‘went back to the pavilion’ after finding out that all eligible people among the affected would be provided alternate arrangements.

Vijayvargiya was approached by affected people, who raised objections over the encroachment removal drive and demanded time of a few days to vacate staff quarters. After reaching the spot, the MLA contacted district collector Lokesh Kumar Jatav over the phone and also had discussion with tehsildar Brahmaswaroop Shrivastava and Rajesh Soni to press for the demand of affected people.

The BJP leader however returned after administrative officials on the spot informed him about making alternative arrangements for eligible people. “The drive was execution of legally passed order,” the collector told TOI.

According to college dean Dr Jyoti Bindal, the management has been waiting from around a year for removal of staff quarters, most of which are illegal acquired, to follow due course of law and after getting clearance from all authorities concerned, they urged district administration and Indore Municipal Corporation (IMC) to remove structures posing as hurdles in proposed works of development.

“We have identified three groups of people, who have acquired staff quarters on college campus. There are around 28 people in the first group, who were never allotted staff quarters but have illegal possession while in second group, there are around 41 employees, to whom quarters were allotted but they are residing somewhere else and have not given up possession,” Dr Bindal told TOI.

She added that in the third group, there are around 54 employees, who have been allotted quarters and they are working in college but structures have been declared ‘unfit for human use’ by district administration.

“Before starting a drive to remove 16 structures of the first group, occupants were issued notices thrice and given adequate time to vacate the staff quarters,” dean said. She added that to provide alternate arrangements to people of third group, the college administration has approached IDA to provide them flats in its scheme.

“We will become guarantor in the affected people of third group to avail flats and will pay installment as per their rent allowance. In this way, they will become owner of the property,” the dean said. She added that after removing hurdles, a 300-seat lecture hall, installation of transformers, parking lot and different services of Super Specialty Hospital will be developed.

Indore: State health minister Tulsiram Silawat on Saturday said that local committees under pre conception and pre natal diagnostic techniques (prohibition of sex selection) act ( PCPNDT ) would be set up in all districts where they don’t exist at present to check illegal abortions and help increase sex ratio.

“We will soon set up PCPNDT cells in all districts of state. The meetings of these cells will be held quarterly while meeting of PCPNDT state-level supervisory board will be held every four months,” Silawat said.

The minister was presiding over supervisory board meeting, which was held after a gap of over three years.

During the meeting, MLA Kalawati Bhuria alleged that sex determination tests were still being carried out in hospitals in Dahod near Jhabua and proper monitoring was needed to stop them.

Another MLA Jhuma Solanki said that while action was being taken against those carrying out sex determination tests, the ones seeking such tests should also be made accused. “Doctors should not be blamed for everything as they are already scared of various clauses in PCPNDT Act. Relaxation should be given on technical issues,” she said .

Senior radiologist, Dr Alok Lahoti, alleged that in-vitro fertilization (IVF) centres were deciding sex of a baby even before a mother conceived them. “This should be addressed and all IVF centres should be registered under PCPNDT Act. MGM Medical College dean Dr Jyoti Bindal raised questions over sale of pregnancy termination medicines over the counter.

The health minister said that steps taken in Indore for improving sex ratio would be followed across the state.

Later, replying to a question over 5000 untraced pregnant women, whose state of delivery was not known, Silawat said, “The matter has come to my knowledge. I will talk to the minister concerned and senior officials of woman and child development department (responsible for physical verification of such women).”

The women had undergone sonography tests in last calendar year but local PCPNDT cell had no record of whether they had delivered or terminated their pregnancies. The district administration has asked WCD officials to carry out a physical verification of these women but the department is yet to furnish the report.

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The Archbishop of Latin Archdiocese M Soosa Pakiam has slammed the Union government over the amendment in Medical Termination of Pregnancy (MTP) Act, extending the period of abortion till six months of pregnancy. Terming the government move unfortunate, Pakiam has also demanded the government to withdraw the amendment.

In a statement issued here, Soosa Pakiam said that the new amendment in MTP Act will only contribute to more abortions in the country. The amended law will only help cultivate a culture in which people will not regret to terminate an unborn child “for their selfish needs”.

“The government should be duty bound to develop a society that has equal space for all categories of people, including unborn children. The government must aim to encourage life and survival against all odds rather than allowing to terminate precious lives,” Pakiam said in his statement.

The Archbishop exhorted the people to align with Kerala Catholic Bishops’ Council Pro-Life Samithy to fight against the amendment. Awareness campaigns will be carried out to sensitise students and youths in this regard. He also urged the support and participation of people in various events, including a seminar and a rally, being organized in the capital city by KCBC Pro Life Samithy on March 25, which is observed as the International Day of Unborn Child. tnn

Bijnor: A leopardess was found dead at Bijnor’s Baharia village on Friday. The carcass seemed to be three or four days old. Going by the condition of the carcass, forest department officials suspect that the big cat succumbed to some disease. However, they will wait for its autopsy report before drawing any conclusions.

This is the seventh case of leopard death in west UP this year. Three of them were killed by villagers in Bijnor, Moradabad and Badaun, respectively. While the fourth died of age–related issues in Bulandshahr’s Bawanpur village. Two were killed in road and rail accidents, respectively. All the deaths took place last month,

According to sources, the carcass of a leopardess, around three years old, was found in a sugarcane field at Baharia village in Bijnor district. A team led by sub divisional forest officer Imtiyaz Siddiqui rushed to the spot on being informed and sent the carcass to the Indian Veterinary Research Institute (IVRI) in Bareilly.

Later, talking with TOI, Siddiqui said, “There were no injury marks on the carcass of the leopard. Prima facie it seems that it died of some disease. Autopsy was carried out on Saturday at IVRI in Bareilly. Viscera of the big cat has been preserved for chemical examination. The real cause of the death is yet to be ascertained.”

The discovery of the leopard carcass comes days after a five-year-old spotted cat was hit by a running train in Haldaur in Bijnor district on January 30. A day earlier on January 29, a leopard was run over by a vehicle on Najibabd-Haridwar road along East Ganga canal.

On January 22, a leopard has been found dead in Bulandshahr’s Bawanpur village. Foresters suspect that it died of old age.

On January 12, a leopard was beaten to death Budaun district. An FIR was registered against eight named and 30-35 unidentified villagers in the case. An SIT was also constituted to probe the brutal killing.

On January 8, forest department filed an FIR against unknown persons after a leopard carcass was found in Kanth area of Moradabad. Postmortem report said a head injury was the cause of death, which could be the result of being “run over by vehicle or hit in the head by someone”.

On January 6, villagers in Bijnor had gunned down a leopard after a child was allegedly mauled to death by the big cat. In all, 80 villagers were booked. After the incident, a special team led by principal wildlife conservator of UP Sunil Pandey visited Mohandiya village in Bijnor tehsil, 30 km from Bhogpur village in Najibabad tehsil, where the leopard was killed. He issued orders to capture a leopardess suspected to have killed at least three of the six people mauled to death by big cats in the district since November 27.

Since November 27, six people have been mauled to death by big cats in west UP and three of the victims hailed from Bijnor district

Experts fear that the increase in man-animal conflict will serve as a boon for hunting tribes and poachers. The wild animals whether alive or dead will end up in wildlife trade as official agencies have not been able to mitigate the growing crisis, they added.

“There is a growing disenchantment among villagers whose role is critical to conservation of wildlife. The fact that forest department is ill-equipped to reduce man-animal conflict will give poachers and hunting tribes like Kanjars and Badhiya a chance join hands with frightened villagers and convince them that they will ‘solve their problems’ and this will obviously expose leopards and other animals in the region to grave risk,” warned Abrar Ahmed, illegal wildlife trade investigator and former programme officer at Trade Records Analysis of Flora and Fauna in Commerce (TRAFFIC-India).

Luxury Volvo buses, which are plying between Jaipur and Delhi, running into heavy losses

JAIPUR: The Rajasthan State Roadways Transport Corporation (RSRTC) is going to procure 48 electric buses and is expecting to get the prototype of the bus by the end of March. After suggesting modifications and requirements, the final fleet of buses is expected by July 2020.

Out of the 48 buses to be bought by the corporation, 22 would ply on the Jaipur-Delhi route so that these buses will operate between Sindhi Camp (Jaipur) to Bikaner House (New Delhi). According to the sources from the RSRTC, the ongoing route of the super luxury buses run on diesel is becoming lesser popular as passengers between Jaipur to Delhi don’t want Kashmiri gate to be their halt in Delhi.

“We are likely to get the prototype of the buses by March. After completing the tender process a letter of intent has also been given to the company which had fulfilled the requirement of the tenders. We will further suggest modifications and requirement after seeing the sample. Thereafter, we will get 48 buses out of which 22 of these buses would be operated on the Jaipur-Delhi route. This will enable us to operate between Jaipur(Sindhi Camp) to New Delhi(Bikaner House) after getting the required permissions,” said UD Khan, managing director, RSRTC told TOI on Saturday.

Khan added that these buses would be environment friendly and passengers would be having a comfortable journey while travelling in these buses. “We are also planning to have CCTV camera in these buses and would be connected to the main server at the Sindhi camp bus stand for the safety and security of the passengers,” Khan added.

According to the officials the electric bus will be equipped with two batteries. Each fully-charged battery will be enough to run the buses for 200 km. On the routes, battery charging facilities would be available in the depots so that during halt time these batteries are fully charged.

Electric buses are currently plying in Delhi, UP and Himachal Pradesh. Rajasthan will be the fourth state to use electric buses for public transport.

MEERUT: Apart from religious chants, loudspeakers at mosques and temples in western Uttar Pradesh will now make announcements to popularise state government’s latest scheme — UP Kisan Asan Kisht Yojana, according to Pashchimanchal Vidyut Vitaran Nigam Limited (PVVNL) officials.

Notably, loudspeakers have always been a bone of contention in Uttar Pradesh, even resulting in communal clashes in the past.

PVVNL managing director Arvind Mallapa Bangari said that the move is aimed at facilitating maximum registrations for the state government’s UP Kisan Asan Kisht Yojana in all 14 districts under its jurisdiction. The scheme helps tube well owners to pay their bills in easy instalments without interest. He added that similar initiatives are in place across the state.

A senior power corporation official said, “It’s good that loudspeakers that have caused undue tensions in the past will be put to some good use now.”

The PVVNL MD said, “During my visit to a camp for promotion of the scheme in a Meerut village, I found that the advertisement of the scheme was not too penetrative to ensure maximum registration. Hence, I have directed the officials concerned to utilize each and every possible means to maximize the reach of the scheme, be it beating of drums, pasting posters or even making announcements on loudspeakers at religious places like mosques and temples. The message should reach even the last person.”

The 14 districts of west UP that fall under PVVNL jurisdiction are Meerut, Baghpat, Ghaziabad, Bulandshahr, Hapur, Gautam Buddh Nagar, Saharanpur , Muzaffarnagar, Shamli, Moradabad, Sambhal, Amroha, Rampur and Bijnor.

File pic of the three sisters at an anti-CAA protest in city

JAIPUR: Twenty one-year-old Saba Naaz, a hijab-clad medical student at a private university, doubles up as an anchor-cum-coordinator at the ongoing protest at Albert Hall in Jaipur.

She is the eldest among the three sisters who come from the orthodox Ahmed family. Saba’s two schoolgoing sisters — Hiba, 17, and Huda, 16, along with their parents Tariq Ahmed and mother Gulshan Tariq have been attending the protest at the hall since January 2 (Day 1). Facing objections from the family and friends for taking girls at the protest site has not deterred Tariq, who believes that his daughters are fighting for a cause.

The family has changed its routine just to adjust to the protest timings. Soon after the trio comes from their institutes and Tariq, a stamp vendor at the local court, they head for the protest site. Initially, the family was among the several protesters, but soon the trio became noticeable faces. Tariq’s eldest child is a son who works to support his family.

“My father has invested everything including his savings on our education. I am proud to have born in a family which has gone all out for our studies. We are the only sisters in our extended family who got the privilege to study in an English medium school,” Saba said. Her two sisters Huda and Hiba are class 11 and 12 students, respectively.

Hiba and Huda hold the banner from the opposite ends and make sure the protest ended on time, while Saba delivers a speech every day which includes updates from the country. “Time management is important as elders have asked us to finish at 7pm every day. We also ensure that speakers don’t use unparliamentary language and keep the speeches restricted to the subject,” Hiba said.

Explaining the reason behind attending the protest, Tariq said, “Education for girls has been a taboo in our society. I wanted to show that girls are no lesser than boys. I have been facing objection from family and friends for taking my girls to the protest site, but I told them that they will not only make me proud, but they will lead by an example.”

Brave effort: Ambulance driver Hameed after being felicitated

MANGALURU: An ambulance driver successfully brought a 40-year-old patient , who suffered a massive heart attack , from Ujire in Belthangady taluk to Kasturba Medical College (KMC), Mangaluru, in 40 minutes.

The patient from Chikkaballapura, who was on his way to Dharmasthala, fell ill when his vehicle reached Sakleshpur on Saturday. The doctor of a private hospital in Ujire near Dharmasthala suggested that the patient’s relatives shift him to KMC Hospital in Mangaluru immediately. Ambulance driver Hameed took just 40 minutes to cover nearly 65km, thereby saving the patient’s life.

Interventional cardiologist Dr Padmanabha Kamath, HoD, cardiology department, KMC, treated the patient and managed to open the artery and restore flow.

Dr Kamath told TOI, “When a 40-year-old tourist from Chikballapur suffered a massive heart attack somewhere near Sakleshpur, little did he know that life will take a different turn. When he reached Dharmasthala, his destination, the chest pain had peaked, and he visited the nearest hospital for treatment. He was having a massive heart attack, and he was advised to go to Mangaluru for further treatment.”

The patient had very low BP and his condition was extremely grave, he said. “After some medication was administered, the patient was taken in the ambulance, fully knowing that the odds are against him. The roads were dug up, and there was a double lane project under way. Hameed drove at a rapid pace under very treacherous conditions to reach Mangaluru within 40 minutes. The real drama unfolded then. When the patient was being shifted to the emergency ward, his heart stopped due to a fatal condition. Since the patient was within the emergency room, shock treatment was administered, which restored his heart beat. Later on, we intervened and managed to open the artery and restore flow,” he added.

Dr Kamath and relatives of the patient felicitated driver Hameed after the surgery.

203,['9/02/2020'],"Police trying to cover up murder, will stage protest: Farmer’s kin","This story is from February 9, 2020

Meerut: Family members of the sugarcane farmer who was murdered allegedly by bouncers at Daurala toll plaza on Tuesday have now threatened to launch a protest claiming that the local police are hand in glove with the accused.

The victim Sohanveer Chauhan’s brother Ravindra Chauhan said, “We don't want any compensation. All we want is justice. We will stage a protest at the commissioner’s office on Monday and if our grievances are not heard, we will begin an indefinite protest.”

Narrating the sequence of events, he said, “We were returning from the field with cane produce when the incident happened. There was a long queue in the cash lane and we decided to take the FASTag lane. This did not go down well with the plaza employees who initially confronted us. The argument soon turned into a brawl and bouncers at the toll plaza began thrashing my brother with rods, lathis and other weapons.”

The postmortem report of the victim has also corroborated claims of torture before death. According to the report, the victim sustained 10 injuries on his body with fractures and ruptures in the internal organs at five places. It read, “The cause of death is shock and haemorrhage as a result of ante-mortem injuries following blunt force trauma.”

The victim’s family members claimed that the toll plaza staff tried to portray the incident as an accident and not murder. Chauhan said, “The toll plaza staff have been giving different statements every time and are trying to destroy evidence. When I returned to the spot, I saw the tractor abandoned near a 11KV power line. The staff told police that my brother was electrocuted. Later, they claimed that my brother lost control of the tractor due to which it turned turtle resulting in his death. They have been making this up despite the fact that I was present at the spot with my brother.”

Meerut SP (city) Akhilesh Narayan Singh said that a 6-minute footage in the CCTV DVR has been erased which is most likely to be an attempt to cover up tracks. “An FIR has been registered and two contractual employees arrested. Based on the findings of the postmortem report, evidence and statement of witnesses, we are carrying out further investigation,” he added.

Nashik: Over 500 people from Nashik took part in the heritage walk at Nandur Madhmeshwar bird sanctuary on Saturday which was jointly organised by the Times group and the forest department.

The local forest officials informed the people about the various aspects of the sanctuary as forest officer Ashok Kale explained to them about how the birds migrate in different seasons.

“It is really beautiful here round the year. There are 265 species of birds at the sanctuary and 148 species that keep migrating to the sanctuary in various seasons from all over the world,” said Kale.

The visitors had gathered at a fixed spot near the sanctuary at 8.30 am. The forest department had provided eight guides to take the group to eight towers made at the sanctuary.

“All of us were divided into eight small groups and each group had a designated guide. We went to all the towers to watch the different types of birds with the help of binoculars provided to us by the forest department. The most unique bird was the spoon bird as its beak is spoon shaped,” said the organisers.

The group was able to see over 40 birds between 9am to 12 noon as the birds have their timings to come out of their nests. “We were strictly told not to wear dark and printed clothes during the visit as it keeps the birds away,” the organisers said.

The sanctuary also has over 30 species of fishes. The visitors could also see snakes, wild cat and deer.The visitors age ranged from 3 years old to 85 years old.

Deepak Chougule, one of the visitors, said, “It was a wonderful morning spent with nature. I would love to go for such excursions.”

<p>Rs 563 crore has been sanctioned for the drinking water project<br></p>

JAIPUR: Even after regularisation, the residents of Prithvi Raj Nagar (PRN) scheme will have to wait for at least two years to get drinking water supply from Bisalpur dam .

The public health engineering department (PHED) has prepared a plan and completed paperwork to supply 90 million litre per day (MLD) under the scheme. According to sources, the project will take 30 months for completion. A senior official said, “The work order will be released to firm next month. The department will lay pipelines in 30 km which will cater to the needs of nearly 5 lakh residents,” he said. As per the proposal, Rs 563 crore has been sanctioned for the drinking water project. The department has issued tenders for Rs 378 crore work.

Sources said, “The PHED has already given Rs 60 crore of its share, while it’s waiting for Rs 118 crore from the JDA,” he added. The project might face problem if the JDA takes more time to transfer its share of funds. After series of meetings, there was an agreement that the JDA would pay the amount. But funds have not been released till date. Earlier, the JDA had provided Rs 60 crore to develop the infrastructure. However, the amount is not sufficient. The official said, “During a meeting at finance department, the JDA was directed to pay Rs 118 crore. We have written to the JDA to release the balance amount,” he added. As per the proposal, the PHED will lay 1,150 km distribution line to supply water in 30 square kilometre area. In June, chief minister Ashok Gehlot had approved the proposal of finance department for this scheme, under which an amount of Rs 445.25 crore will be payable by the state government.

According to proposal, the scheme will be completed in two phases up to 2022-23.

“The estimated cost of its first phase is Rs 854.22 crore. According to Part-A of the first phase, infrastructure development in 175 square kilometre of Prithvi Raj Nagar and water distribution network in 30 square km will be done. Its estimated expenditure is Rs 563.93 crore,” said the official.

207,['9/02/2020'],"Polls in 55 cantonments, including Deolali, deferred","This story is from February 9, 2020

Nashik: The Ministry of Defence (MoD) has deferred elections in 55 cantonment boards across the country.

Officials said the ministry will now release a fresh date for the elections.

Of these 55 cantonment boards, seven are in Maharashtra — Deolali (Nashik), Aurangabad, Ahmednagar, Pune, Khadki, Dehu Road and Kamptee (Nagpur).

Deputy director of MoD Rajesh Kumar Shah, in a written communiqué on February 5, informed the General Officer Commanding-in-Chief (GOC-in-C) about the ministry’s decision. The letter cited “administrative” reasons.

“The term of office of all elected members of these cantonment boards has been extended for six months, or till the date of the constitution of the Board, whichever is earlier,” read the MoD communiqué.

Elections in these 55 cantonment boards, which last took place in 2014, were slated for this month. In fact, Cantonment Board, Deolali (CBD) had already started preparations for elections in the eight seats. It had recently conducted a lottery to reserve three seats for women candidates as per instructions from the MoD in November.

Ajay Kumar, the CEO of CBD, told TOI that the board has decided not to proceed with the poll preparations given the latest instruction from the MoD.

“We will restart the poll preparation work after we receive the green signal to do so from the ministry,” Kumar said.

Elected members of the CBD said they are happy that the MoD had extended their tenure. CBD vice-president Bhagwan Katariya said the feedback he has received suggested six other cantonment boards are due for elections in June this year.

“It is possible that the MoD is planning to organise simultaneous polls in 61 cantonment boards simultaneously in June. That is perhaps why elections in 55 boards were deferred,” Kataria said.

Prabhavati Dhiware, another elected member of the CBD, said an extension to her tenure meant she will now get some more time to finish pending projects.

“We have been waiting for funds to build a community hall in Ward No. 1. We also need a dialysis machine at the cantonment hospital. We will try to ensure that funds for the projects reach us before the election,” Dhiware said.

Another elected member of CBD, Baburao Mojad said even new projects can be planned by existing members due to extensions of their tenures.

Sahgal rued that change in environment has led to not only crop loss, but loss of human lives too with 40 farmers committing suicide in Maharashtra.

He said there are more than 300 small and big dams that have changed the balance of the ecosystem.

209,['9/02/2020'],18 Disha police stations set up in Andhra Pradesh,"This story is from February 9, 2020

Chief minister YS Jaganmohan Reddy inaugurates Disha Police station in Rajahmundry on Saturday.

VIJAYAWADA/RAJAHMUNDRY: AP government on Saturday launched 18 special Disha police stations across the state for speedy investigation and trial of cases related to sexual offences against women. The state government recently amended rules to ensure that trial in rape cases are completed within 21 days and these police stations will help in fast completion of investigation.

The government also launched the Disha mobile application on Saturday. Chief minister YS Jaganmohan Reddy inaugurated the first Disha police station at Rajahmundry and launched the mobile app. Later, Disha police stations were opened at other towns in the state.

One Disha police station has been set up at every police district headquarters in the state. The police stations will be headed by a deputy superintendent of police (DSP) rank officer with two circle inspectors and three sub-inspector rank officers to handle investigation. There will be between 36 and 47 support staff to assist the investigators.

“Setting up of Disha police stations is a historic decision and first of its kind in the country. Incidents like Nirbhaya and Disha have moved the collective conscience of society. However, little was done to prevent such incidents in the first place. Disha Act and creation of infrastructure for its implementation will ensure not only justice to the victims but will also save women from ending up as victims,” Jagan said in Rajahmundry.

The CM added that Disha Act is in the concurrent list. “The state government has sent it for central government’s assent. The Act is being vetted by the Union ministry and will be notified in the state gazette soon. Once notified, the new legislation will come into force,” he said. Without waiting for the Act to come into force, the state government has sanctioned Rs 100 crore to create an ecosystem to implement the Act, he said.

Jagan added that apart from establishing special police stations, special courts will also be set up once the high court gives the green light. “These special courts will deal with cases booked under Disha Act exclusively and deliver justice in two weeks,” he said.

The chief minister, after launching the Disha app, tested it by pressing the SOS button. The process of initiating the call from the mobile device to receiving it at the Disha control room and deploying the teams to the location were demonstrated live. The Disha enforcement team reached the spot by tracing the coordinates of the call origin and reported to the chief minister. The CM appreciated the officers involved in designing of Disha app.

While city police commissioner Ch Dwaraka Tirumala Rao inaugurated the Disha police station in Vijayawada, Krishna district SP Ravindranath Babu launched the station at Machilipatnam. All district SPs and commissioners of police participated in the video conference held by the chief minister.

VADODARA: Continuing the recent spate of break-ins in and around the city, thieves this time struck rich from the houses of BJP councillor of Vadodara Municipal Corporation (VMC) as well as that of a joint charity commissioner of Surat.

Thieves stole BJP councillor from ward 17, Alpesh Limbachiya’s SUV from outside his house in Motinagar in Tarsali early on Saturday morning. According to Limbachiya, two persons came in a car near his house at around 4.15 am.

After parking their car at a distance, the duo broke open the SUV door’s lock and opened the car’s bonnet. Within a couple of minutes, they started the car and quickly escaped with Limbachiya’s car along with the hatchback they had come in.

Limbachiya realized about the theft of his SUV only at around 8.30 am when he came out of the house to leave for work.

He searched for the car in the neighbourhood but not being able to locate it anywhere, he checked the footage of CCTV camera installed outside his house. The footage revealed the theft of the SUV.

The councillor, who is also the ruling party’s chief whip in the civic body, said that Rs 80,000 which he had kept in the car’s glove box was also stolen. The cash, he said was to be paid to industrial labourers.

PANAJI: To improve healthcare and ensure quality health services, even in rural areas, the private sector has to be roped in, said health minister Vishwajit Rane on Saturday.

Rane said that while the government could take care of the primary and secondary tier of healthcare, the private sector could be tasked with providing tertiary healthcare.

The minister was speaking at a conference on financing India’s healthcare needs organised by the Goa Institute of Management . “I believe that public-private partnership is very important. Primary and secondary health care can be taken care of by the government and the tertiary care, here is where the private sector can come in,” Rane said. He said finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman’s Budget proposal to set up medical colleges in existing district hospitals under the public private partnership (PPP) mode would be a game-changer.

“In Goa, if you give us the money or if we put in 40%, and the colleges the rest…We have been asked if we were interested in such a project. Having one more government college in Goa may not be viable but taking the private sector onboard can work,” he said.

Dehradun: The Dehradun railway station, which was closed for three months due to renovation work, reopened on Saturday. However, some construction work was still ongoing in the station as a result of which all seven trains that entered the station on Saturday were delayed. Platform 5 had construction materials scattered all over at the start of the day, but railway officials cleared them eventually. Doon station director Ganesh Chand Thakur told TOI, “Train movement started at the station after a long time today. Therefore, there was some inconvenience. A little bit of construction work is still left and going on in the station premises, but will be completed very soon.”

Meanwhile, in the renovated station, lengths of all five platforms have been increased by 630 metres in order to accommodate trains with 18 to 20 coaches. All old tracks have also been replaced. A third platform (platform number three) has been built. However, the new platform has only one staircase and no lift or escalator, which passengers said on Saturday, was creating major inconvenience especially for the elderly.

Most passengers though were relieved that the station has opened. Jugal Desai, a resident of Mumbai who works in Haldwani, said that the three months that the station was closed were difficult for him. He boarded the Doon-Naini Jan Shatabdi to reach Doon station on Saturday. “I used to travel by bus from Doon to Haldwani during the three months that the station was closed. It was very difficult,” Desai said.

Mukesh Kumar Yadav, a porter at the station said, “It was a tough time for us when the station was closed. We went to Uttar Pradesh for alternate sources of income. Around 45 porters work at Doon station, all of whom were affected.”

Anil Jain, the owner of a book kiosk at the station, too, expressed similar sentiments. “There was nothing to do for the last three months. It was difficult to run my household. Railway authorities should have thought of vendors like us before they decided to close the station for such a long time.”

The trains that reached Doon station on Saturday were Doon-Naini Janshatabdi, Doon-Delhi Shatabdi, Doon-Amritshar Lahori Express, Doon-Howrah Express, Mussoorie Express, Gorakhpur Express and Nandadevi Express. However, no 18-coach train entered the station on Saturday.

It is feared that the polluted water will also harm the Ganga and wildlife at Hastinapur Wildlife Sanctuary, through which the river flows.

The Chhoiya is so polluted that the groundwater in the area is also contaminated and unfit for drinking.

The river flows past some 50 villages, including Sundarpur, Ravanpur, Navada, Gadana, Hadarpur, Sihora, Salmabad, Bhairera, Agri, Jalalpur, Sikandari and Shahpur Lal, Residents said they have repeatedly complained against the polluting industries. Earlier, Pollution Control Board had cracked the whip on the industries over this issue. Now, forest officials claimed that the condition had worsened.

According to a survey carried out by Jal Nigam authorities in 2018, water samples collected from 17 villages, some 20-25 km away from the Chhoiya, were found to have 0.05 mg/l arsenic against 0.01 mg/l permissible level.

Forest department officials said the polluted water not only affects human beings but also wildlife. It poses a threat to Hastinapur sanctuary, a hub of black buck, swamp deer, otters and several domestic and migratory birds. The Chhoiya passes through both Bijnor and Chandpur ranges, which are a part of Hastinapur sanctuary, before merging with the Ganga.

Now forest department has come up with a plan to make this tributary free of pollution. Giving details about the plan, Bijnor divisional forest officer M Semmaran said, “We have chalked out a project with the help of a private engineer. Our team conducted a survey of the Chhoiya. The project is part of the Namami Gange campaign. Around seven check dams estimated to cost Rs 1 crore will be constructed across the river and banana and other plants that absorb heavy metals will be sown along it. In these check dams, water will be stored so that the heavy metal and effluents settle at the bottom. Certain types of bacteria will be introduced in the polluted water for absorbing the effluents. The filtered water will then be released through pipes into the Ganga. This project was earlier implemented in Agra as well.”

According to villagers of Navada village, said, “Some industries are releasing untreated water into the Chhoiya and this seeps into the ground, polluting the groundwater. The river stinks so much that its foul smell pervades even at a distance of 4km from it. Water drawn from pumps is murky with chemical pollutants. Earlier, several villagers who consumed this water developed stomach and skin ailments and some succumbed to cancer. The situation is so bad that many villagers have shifted away from the polluted Chhoiya.”

MOHALI: A triple-storey building with a basement collapsed in Mohali on Saturday, leaving one person dead and three others injured.

Around 12.30 pm, a JCB machine was digging the basement adjoining the building owned by Parveen Kumar Ambika of Ambika Constructions for a hotel/restaurant.

According to eyewitnesses, when the machine had dug up around 10-feet of earth, the building suddenly came crashing down, burying four people. While two people were rescued within minutes, one of them was pulled out of the debris after eight hours. Passers-by rushed to the rescue of the people trapped and managed to pull out two, identified as Harjeet Singh, and Prem Bahadur, who is under treatment at civil hospital, Kharar. The victim was identified as Harvinder Singh, alias Babbu, a JCB driver.

Deputy commissioner Girish Dayalan said, “We got information around 12.35 pm about the building collapse. The district administration led by sub-divisional magistrate and additional deputy commissioner reached the site. Emergency services, including fire tenders and medical teams, were pressed into action. A team of NDRF with specialised equipment was contacted and called from Panchkula. A team of 25 people started the rescue operation. A back-up team from Ludhiana was also called.” The DC said that the Western Command of the Army was also contacted for help.

He said machines for clearing the debris required by the NDRF were locally arranged. A total of seven to eight JCB machines and four to five cranes were pressed into rescue operation.

Meerut: Days after three samples of suspected cases of novel coronavirus – which were sent to Lucknow for testing – tested negative, special wards have been set up in the district hospital and Lala Lajpat Rai Memorial (LLRM) Medical College.

So far, 56 people who returned from China last month have been identified in Meerut and are being closely monitored for any symptoms.

“In the backdrop of the instructions that we’ve got from the state authorities, a 10-bed ward dedicated to the suspected case of Coronavirus has been set up. We have also maintained personal kits for each patient—if required in any case,” said Dr PK Bansal, superintendent in chief, PL Sharma district hospital.

An equal number of beds have also been set up in the LLRM Medical College as well. “We have set up a 10-bed ward at Lala Lajpat Rai Memorial Medical College to isolate suspected cases of Coronavirus,” said Dr RC Gupta, principal LLRM Medical College.

Requesting people to calm down, Bansal said, “One should not panic in the backdrop of Corona virus. Rather, one should focus on keeping clean surroundings and washing their hands from time to time to prevent any infection. While there is no cure of coronavirus till now, but isolating the patient and putting them on antibiotics to prevent secondary infections is a way that will be dealt with currently.”

Notably, death toll in China has sharply risen to 722, while the total number of confirmed cases has jumped to 34,546.

220,['9/02/2020'],"Rs 1,204 crore spent, but 153 projects still remain incomplete: CAG report","This story is from February 9, 2020

Pramod Sawant

PANAJI: Pointing out that at least 153 infrastructure projects remain incomplete despite Rs 1,204 crore being spent on them, the Comptroller and Auditor General on India (CAG) said that delay in completion of projects can lead to losses to the state exchequer.

In its report for 2017-18, the CAG report said that as on March 31, 2018, there were 111 roads, bridges and buildings across the state that remain incomplete. The remaining incomplete projects are in the irrigation and water supply category.

“As the delay in completion of projects entails the risk of cost escalation and denial of intended benefits to beneficiaries, the state government may re-evaluate the cost of all incomplete projects and evolve a mechanism for timely completion of projects,” said the CAG report.

The report has taken into account only those projects valued at more than Rs 1 crore.

Chief minister Pramod Sawant , in his budget for 2020-21, has taken it upon himself to complete 50 ongoing projects in the coming financial year.

The CAG report found significant time and cost escalation in the Tillari irrigation project, which is a joint venture between the Goa and Maharashtra governments. Officials said that the project remains incomplete due to a delay in land acquisition. The directorate of accounts did not provide the CAG with any estimate of the cost escalation.

A bridge linking Benaulim to Sinquetim has been left incomplete since 2010, with the Keri-Tiracol bridge suffering a similar fate. The JICA water pipelines and sewerage network remain incomplete in Goa despite being launched several years ago, and with the National Games scheduled to be held this year, the Chicalim squash complex and tennis court at Fatorda are also nowhere close to completion.

The report also said that the financial results of the undertaken irrigation works have not been worked out by the state government. The Goa government incurred an expenditure of Rs 79.6 crore on maintenance of irrigation projects in the state during 2017-18, which was Rs 12.6 crore more than the maintenance expenditure incurred by it in 2016-17. In 2016-17, the expenditure on maintenance of irrigation works stood at Rs 66.9 crore.

MOHALI: Taking serious note of Saturday’s building collapse in Mohali , Punjab chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh has asked the additional district magistrate (ADM), Mohali, to conduct a thorough probe into the incident and submit a report within a week.

The chief minister also directed the district administration to take all possible steps to rescue those who might be still trapped in the debris, according to an official spokesperson.

According to information received from the deputy commissioner, Mohali, Girish Dayalan, two or three persons were believed to be still under the debris and rescue operations were going on a war footing.

The entire cost of the treatment of those injured in this incident would be borne by the state government as per the chief minister’s orders, said a spokesperson, adding that so far two persons had been rescued and were under treatment.

According to the deputy commissioner, preliminary information suggests that a JCB was at work on the construction site adjacent the building when the structure collapsed. Probe would also ascertain if the construction was illegal or not, said the spokesperson.

Deputy commissioner Girish Dayalan said, “A magisterial enquiry have been marked to SDM Kharar supported by three other officers. He will ascertain causes of building collapse and will mark responsibility after which we will go in for registration of FIR. It will be seen if any of this was illegal or necessary permissions obtained. If found not in order, the guilty will be brought to book.”

He said the report would be initiated once the rescue operations were over ensuring that no one was trapped and no fatalities.

JAIPUR: Delhi’s Shaheen Bagh protest continues to inspire round-the-clock anti-CAA protest in Rajasthan . In the last one week alone, Chittorgarh, Sawai Madhopur and Bundi have started living the Shaheen Bagh moment by taking the tally of 24/7 protests to six in the state. The other three districts are Sikar, Kota and Jaipur.

Inspired by the longest non-stop sit-in by women, retired police officer Faizullah Sheikh spread a banner featuring symbols of all major religions and a picture of BR Ambedkar at Quilla Road to start an indefinite sit-in against CAA from Friday. “The round-the-clock protest in Chittorgarh is to raise our voice against the injustice, to establish social leadership and to establish communal harmony. Here we have decided to reach out to non-Muslim brothers and tell them our concerns with the CAA aiming to seek their support like the way women in Delhi are doing,” Sheikh said. They have decided that women will join the protest during the day, while men will be stationed at the site at night. The historic Mirzaji Ka Bagh in Sawai Madhopur city has become an epicentre for round-the-clock dharna. From the past four days, the dharna has continued. Unlike Shaheen Bagh in Delhi, here women control the movement during the day, while men hold the charge in the night.

Nisar Ullah, chief quazi of Sawai Madhopur says the protest will continue till Shaheen Bagh protest is on. “This is in solidarity with the brave women of Delhi who have shown us the way to raise our voice. We had two choices either to join the protest at Shaheen Bagh or create our own Shaheen bagh and we chose the latter. I am happy the way we have been receiving support from the people of all faiths and communities,” said the quazi over phone. Barely 40 metres away from Lok Sabha speaker Om Birla’s residence in Kota, a group of women are holding round-the-clock sit-in. A graduate in human rights, Shifa Khalid, who started the sit-in with five other women for a couple of hours in the afternoon of January 14 outside Eidgah, had no idea of receiving immediate support and that it will turn into a non-stop protest. The protest site and Birla’s residence are divided by a road and a lane.

Birla has given them a written assurance of raising their demand with PM Narendra Modi. Most of these women come from low income areas like Kishorpura, Rampura, Makbara, Shreepura and Waqf Board.

Khalid, a mother of three sons, credits her husband for being able to lead the non-stop protest. “My husband is my biggest support who picks and drops me to the protest site and takes care of our children in my absence,” Khalid said. The core group which is managing the protest includes 10-15 women, mostly students. They have been receiving support from non-Muslim women, but they are either activists or academicians. So far, no commoner has extended support to them. They have kept the protest non-religious and don’t raise slogans which are religious in nature.

The round the clock sit-in requires logistics support like bedding, water, food, urinals which is being supplied by community members at these places. At none of the protesting sites, the protesters have complained of police using any coercive measures to disperse them.

PUNE: The Maharashtra Real Estate Regulatory Authority (MahaRERA) has directed developers with occupancy certificate to file a source complaint on denial of project registration with sub-registrar offices for want of Rera enrollment.

“Once a developer files a source complaint, the authority will look into it at the earliest. If the authority decides that the project doesn’t require MahaRERA registration, the developer can approach the sub-registrar office and get the project registered,” a MahaRERA officials said.

The move brings relief to developers in the state as they were not able to register their projects with the sub-registrar office for want of RERA registration, though they had occupancy certificate ready.

As per the rules, projects with occupancy certificates are not required to register with MahaRERA. However, a revenue department circular issued in September last year insisted on registration of all projects with RERA before registering them with sub-registrar offices in the state.

Members of the Confederation of Real Estate Developers Association of India (Credai) too had raised the issue, saying that the RERA rules specifically mention that projects with completion/occupation certificate before the registration of sale deed were exempted from RERA registration.

Revenue minister Balasaheb Thorat had told TOI last week that he had directed all the departments concerned to issue clarity on the subject.

Representative image

JAIPUR: NEET UG medical and dental admission/counselling board chairman has informed the medical education department that it would not conduct counselling over allegations levelled against it of gross irregularities in 2019 admissions. The board is headed by principal and controller of Sawai Man Singh Medical college.

“Rajasthan is the only state in the country where the counselling for NEET is done by medical colleges. In other states, it is done by directorate of medical education (DME). We are disciplined professionals (health) and we are not legal experts. We do not want to conduct the counselling anymore as our clinical and teaching work hampers as a large number of doctors have to get involve in counselling. So it is better that DME should conduct the counselling now,” Dr Sudhir Bhandari, principal and controller, SMS medical college told TOI on Saturday, who wrote to the government for quitting the post of chairperson of NEET counselling board.

The board has 38 members who are representatives of 38 medical colleges of the state. Besides, the board has representatives from the government. The government nominates two legal advisors.

The head of the board, which has been conducting it for years, has written to the medical education department that it does not want to conduct it anymore.

There were alleged irregularities in NEET PG counselling last year and the matter landed up in Rajasthan High Court. Following the high court directions, counselling was held again. Therefore, the SMS Medical College is reluctant to conduct counselling this year, while the medical education department is insisting that the college should do it.

The board has also expressed its resentment for being blamed for gross irregularities in 2019 in NEET counselling. “We are not legal experts. The government had appointed two legal experts in the NEET counselling board. Despite of that, we are blamed for gross irregularities in NEET counselling. There were legal issues for which we were made responsible. We cannot handle legal issues, if anything goes wrong. For the purpose, the government nominated two legal advisors. The board did as per legal advisors,” said Dr Bhandari.

However, the board has also alleged that there are differences in opinions between the board and the DME in NEET counselling. The board alleged that the DME always turned down board’s suggestion and blamed the board for gross irregularities.

Despite repeated attempts, medical education principal secretary Vaibhav Galriya did not respond the calls. However, the medical education department is insisting the board to continue conducting NEET counselling in a letter written to the medical education department.

VIJAYAWADA: A 17-year-old girl was found murdered under suspicious circumstances at Lingamguntla village under Narasaraopet mandal in Guntur district on Saturday. Lakkana Tanusha was a student of intermediate second year. Initial police probe suggest death by strangulation. The mother of the two teenagers suspects the girl’s brother, Kumara Swamy, as he is known for violent behaviour.

Swamy, 19, was the only person home apart from the victim on the intervening night of Friday and Saturday when the incident took place. He told police three unidentified miscreants barged into their house between 11 pm and midnight and attacked him and his sister. He survived the attack but his sister died, he said in his statement to police.

But answers given by Swamy and circumstantial evidence point towards him. Narasaraopet rural inspector Y Achaiah said there was no scope for outsiders to enter the house as Swamy and his sister bolted doors from inside. Though Swamy claimed the miscreants entered from the back door by pushing it hard there was no evidence to suggest breaking of the latch.

Achaiah added they did not find any visible injuries on Swamy contrary to his claim miscreants attacked him and his sister. “Even on the victim’s body except for a small scar on the forehead and strangulation marks around the neck there are no visible injuries” he said.

Swamy’s and Tanusha’s parents separated about two years ago. The kids stayed with the father who runs a small printing press. Swamy, a school dropout, works with his father at the press.

All family went to Tiruvuru in Krishna district on Friday to attend their grandfather’s death ceremony. The father told police he sent the kids back to Narasaraopet as Tanusha had examinations on Saturday and Sunday. Interestingly, no exams were scheduled on Saturday and Sunday at her college.

Swamy and Tanusha reached home around 9 pm on Friday. He phoned his father at around 1 am to say Tanusha died in an attack by unknown miscreants. The father informed police after coming to Lingamguntla at around 5 am on Saturday.

Achaiah said all angles to identify killer/s and motive are being probed. The mother too suspects Swamy. “Swamy’s answers do not match circumstantial evidence. He is a suspect. We will come to a conclusion after completing our probe,” the police inspector said.

Jaipur: Thieves on Sawai Man Singh (SMS) Hospital premises have become a major problem for the patients’ attendants, who have to sleep outside the main hospital building braving the bone-chilling cold.

They also target the vehicles parked at parking lot of the hospital for stealing belongings of patients’ attendants such as helmets. A speaker installed at the parking lot keeps alerting the vehicle owners about the safety of their belongings.

Inside the hospital, the guards are deployed and it is equipped with CCTV cameras. But, outside the hospital, attendants of the patients have to remain vigilant all night while sleeping on the floor. “We regularly get complaints of petty theft, such as thieves took away someone’s bags and other belongings. We have deployed guards but since a lot of patients and attendants come to hospital every day, it is difficult to get security for all of them. The attendants have to remain careful to avoid such theft,” said Dr DS Meena, medical superintendent, SMS Hospital. Apart from the ‘drug’ mafia and those involved in selling and purchasing blood, the petty thieves have become a menace in the hospital. Recently, the hospital administration called the cops, when it found two persons allegedly sold blood to patients.

However, police are yet to take it seriously. “We are aware about it and have deployed policemen in civil dress,” said SHO, Moti Doongri.

233,['9/02/2020'],"Poll code, series of transfers ground campaign to make roads safer in Pune","TimesView Some ground rules are necessary to ensure that elections and transfers do not stall projects and initiatives on important issues like road safety. The city needs some action on the ground to bring order and discipline in traffic. We are fortunate to have several individuals and organisations willing to spare time and help achieve some method. The least the officials can do is to ensure that matters move forward, irrespective of who is in the office, once an action plan is worked out. Only then can we make some impact and address problems before they become chronic.

PUNE: Two elections and transfers of the municipal commissioner, the head of the Pune traffic police and the Pune Mahanagar Parivahan Mahamandal Limited (PMPML) have affected the Pune Road Safety Campaign launched by former mayor Mukta Tilak last February.“The progress of the campaign has been slow. Two elections and the model code of conduct were in place for several months in 2019. There has been a change in leadership and transfers of government officers. The mayor changed, the deputy commissioner of police for traffic was transferred, followed by transfers of the PMPML chairperson and managing director, the municipal commissioner and head of PMC ’s road department,” Harshad Abhyankar, director of Save Pune Traffic Movement , said.A review meeting was chaired by Tilak last May.“She proposed that the next meeting be held after the road safety committee was formed. We picked up a few initiatives and started work. One was establishing mid-block crossing prototype at one road in association with Parisar, an NGO. The next was training for PMPML drivers to ensure that they halt at the stop lines at traffic signals. They needed material, including a laptop, which was approved by former PMPML CMD Nayana Gunde, but the actual purchase is yet to be made,” he said.Abhyankar said they are working on pedestrian signals and have discussed the needful with the PMC electrical department.“However, no funds have been allocated in the draft budget. We have met the head of the department and he keen on getting it done. The enforcement of a helmet is a priority. We have met the police commissioner about a month and a half ago,” he added.Mayor Murlidhar Mohol said he has already been apprised of the campaign and will initiate the work soon. “I have got all the information about the Pune Road Safety Campaign. We will meet the municipal commissioner, officials and NGOs soon,” he added.According to Parisar’s programme director Ranjit Gadgil, the campaign has failed to pick up pace.“We are working on mid-block crossings and the tender has been allotted. We will be working with the contractor on developing the crossing on one road, first. We will also evaluate whether it has helped make crossing the road safer. However, the head of the road department has changed and we will have to apprise the new person of what needs to be done. The campaign must pick up pace,” he said.Samaiirah from Safe Road Foundation added that the committee must be formed.“We are going to propose shortlisting an area where road safety measures will be implemented. A similar plan can then be replicated in other areas of the city.

234,['9/02/2020'],Docs save girl by removing Rs 1 coin lodged in windpipe,"This story is from February 9, 2020

Nashik: A tribal girl from Surgana got a new lease of life on Saturday after doctors at the Nashik civil hospital performed an emergency surgery to remove a Re 1 coin she had swallowed by accident.

Her parents thanked the doctors profusely as it emerged that they were twice refused immediate care — A rural hospital in their taluka said it didn’t have expert doctors and another doctor at a private hospital, near their village, gave up.

Payal Ashok Varade, a nine-year-old resident of Avalpada in the Surgana taluka, was playing at her home on Friday when she accidentally swallowed the coin at around 5.30 pm.

The girl soon started to experience breathing difficulties. Senior doctors at the Nashik civil hospital said her parents first took her to the Surgana rural hospital. But there, the parents were asked to take the girl to a private hospital because the rural facility did not have an ear, nose and throat (ENT) specialist.

The parents then moved her to a private hospital at the taluka headquarters. But the private doctor there was unable to provide help.

Sanjay Gangurde, the ENT surgeon at the Nashik civil hospital said the girl’s parents were finally able to reach Nashik at around 12.30 am. Gangurde, who was on duty at the time, immediately ordered an X-ray, which found the coin lodged in Payal’s windpipe. Anaesthetists were then told to prepare her for surgery.

“The coin was stuck in the cricopharynx level. This is dangerous and people have lost their lives for such obstructions. But my team and I were able to remove the coin using laryngoscopy. The operation lasted 45 minutes,” Gangurde said.

Laryngoscopy is a medical procedure that gives doctors a close-up view of the larynx and throat. By Saturday morning, Payal, declared out of danger, was up and speaking to her parents.

Civil surgeon Suresh Jagdale, additional civil surgeon Nikhil Saindane and other senior doctors praised Gangurde and his team for their timely action.

Ranjit Singh, Kuldeep Singh, Birjesh Kumar, Meena, Saroj Gupta, Varinder Pal, Surinder Kumar said, “We thought that it is an earthquake. When we rushed out of our house, we learnt that a building opposite our housing society has collapsed.”

Meena, a housewife, said, “I was working in the kitchen when I felt tremors and thinking that it to be a massive earthquake, I rushed out of my house. Then I saw huge smoke of dust just across the road and learnt that the triple storey building collapsed and it was not an earthquake.”

Residents said on learning this they all rushed to the spot to find that the entire structure came crashing down and many people were trapped under the debris.

Ranjit Singh, Kuldeep Singh, Birjesh Kumar, Varinder Pal, Surinder Kumar said they immediately started the rescue operation as they could listen the cries of the people trapped under the debris.

PANAJI: The Corporation of the City of Panaji (CCP) has discouraged the use of single-use plastics at this year’s carnival float parade, instead recommending that eco-friendly, recyclable and sustainable materials be used in an effort to reduce waste.

“We will aim for the floats to be plastic-free. The use of single-use plastic will be curtailed in a serious way,” said CCP commissioner Sanjit Rodrigues .

To ensure that tourists and locals visiting the parade do not litter the place with plastic bottles, CCP plans to install water stations, wherein water will be served to attendees in disposable cups.

This year, the flagship Panaji event has shifted back from the more-recent Miramar to Dona Paula route to the traditional Patto to Adil Shah palace to Kala Academy route. Goa celebrates carnival from February 22 to 25 this year.

“The police will draw up arrangements, with traffic diversion plans. We have asked for permission from the North Goa collectorate. We have also asked for volunteers to manage the crowd,” Rodrigues said. Efforts are also being made to ensure that the festival floats feature qualitative tableaus ,this year, he said. Entry forms will cost Rs 1,000, while spot-entries will be levied a fee of Rs 5,000. Moreover, consolation prizes have been cancelled for categories which evoke poor response each year.

Apart from the float parade, CCP will also organise their popular music and food fest, ‘Samba Square’, at the Jardim Garcia de Orta. This year, CCP will host activities for children as well as senior citizens, besides the usual entertainment .

The commissioner also said that local artistes will be given exposure in the entertainment section, wherein musicians and local performers will get a platform to showcase their talent. As a safety precaution, emergency and fire services personnel will be posted at the venue.

At present, the railway station has 35 CCTVs which have poor quality recording

CHANDIGARH: The decade-old project on installation of CCTV cameras will be executed by the Indian Railway Stations Development Corporation Limited ( IRSDC ) at Chandigarh railway station .

S K Lohia, managing director and chief executive officer of the IRSDC said that during the world class project, the IRSDC would install hi-tech CCTVs as per the requirement of the station.

He said CCTVs, bag scanner and metal detector would be installed by the IRSDC as per the railway norms. The RPF and GRP would continue their services for security arrangements at the station.

The proposal for installing new CCTVs at 25 spots, including entry and exit points, end of the platforms, circulating area and near booking counter, has been chalked out by the GRP which was submitted to the Ambala division for implementation. But after the station was handed over to the IRSDC, confusion prevailed that which agency would execute the project.

At present, the station has 35 CCTVs which have poor quality recording.

On the recommendation of the station improvement group (SIG), the security department has drafted the proposal for new CCTVs and baggage scanner. The proposal also includes metal detectors on the entry and exit points on both Chandigarh and Panchkula side of the station.

Another proposal which will be executed by the IRSDC will be face lifting of the railway protection force (RPF) office at the railway station. A plan has been mooted out by the department to the Indian Railway Stations Development Corporation Limited (IRSDC) about the requirement in the new building constructed under the world class station project at Chandigarh.

Sources said the RPF, Chandigarh, had been asked by the headquarters to prepare a detail plan about the infrastructure required by them at the Chandigarh station.

In a plan which was chalked out by the RPF, a demand was raised for a room for RPF in-charge, hall for staff of the RPF, separate lock up for male and female, investigation room, record room, weapon strong room and a store.

Plan Of New Dairies

Worst fears gone

TRQ abolished, BCD now at 40%

For two consecutive years, the dairy co-operatives of Gujarat had witnessed an unprecedented glut of milk. It was for the first time in the history of Gujarat, the cradle of India’s White Revolution, that procurement price paid to farmers had plummeted by 10-15% in 2017-18 and 2018-19. This was happening in a state which prides itself for paying the highest procurement price to dairy farmers.But improvement in domestic skimmed milk powder (SMP) prices coupled with increase in demand for dairy products has once again put the dairy co-operatives on a growth trajectory.""The final price which farmers in Gujarat got for milk fat last year was Rs 690 per kg. This year, this price is likely to be 10 to 15 % more,"" said a top official of the Gujarat Co-operative Milk Marketing Federation (GCMMF) – the apex body of all the milk co-operatives of Gujarat that markets dairy products under the brand Amul.The SMP price in India had crashed to Rs 150-160 per kg in 2018-19 which has currently recovered to Rs 325 per kg.This financial year, GCMMF, which has now turned into an 18-member milk co-operatives body, is expecting to touch the Rs 40,000 crore mark, a 20% growth compared to Rs 33,000 crore annual turnover mark, which it had clocked in the last financial year.‘Taste of India’ had got a billion-dollar tag in 2007 when the home-grown dairy giant had become the country’s largest food business by clocking Rs 4,300 crore turnover.GCMMF’s managing director R S Sodhi is predicting that within the next five years (by 2025), Amul will be a Rs 1 lakh crore enterprise.""For this, we (GCMMF) and our member unions will be adding capacity to process 120 lakh litres per day (LLPD) of milk taking up our total milk processing capacity to 500 LLPD with nearly Rs 5,000 crore fresh investment,"" Sodhi told TOI.Last year, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had urged the home-grown dairy giant to emerge as one of the world’s top three milk processors by 2022.Milk cooperatives of Gujarat have already left footprints across the country – be it Manesar in Haryana or Kolkata in West Bengal. GCMMF and its member milk cooperatives currently run 84 dairy processing plants inside and outside Gujarat. And all of them are currently on expansion mode.""Projects are being planned for setting up dairies at Pune, Kolkata, Punjab, eastern and western Uttar Pradesh, Ujjain, Madhya Pradesh by our member unions in addition to expansion projects for milk and milk products at the dairy plants within Gujarat,"" a top official of GCMMF said.Liquid milk still brings in nearly 92% of the revenue. ""But growth is also coming from newer segments. We believe that the segments which are witnessing 2% growth will see 10% growth in the next five years,"" said Sodhi.In October last year, millions of farmers in Gujarat, had faced their worst fears. As government was in final stages of the proposed Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP), women milk producers from Gujarat had sent 15 lakh postcards urging Prime Minister (PM) Narendra Modi’s intervention. RCEP, proposed free-trade agreement (FTA) between ten member states of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and its six FTA partners – China, India, Japan, South Korea, Australia and New Zealand, would have meant dumping of foreign surplus milk in India impacting domestic milk prices. Itwould have proven suicidal for India’s dairy sector, both Amul and the National Dairy Development Board (NDDB) – had said. In November, much to the relief of farmers, the PM announced India is pulling out from RCEP.A big relief for dairy cooperatives in Gujarat has come in the form of the Centre’s Budget announcement to abolish tariff rate quota (TRQ) and restoring basic customs duty (BCD) on imported dairy products from 30% to 40%. ""Developed countries will no longer be able to dump their surplus milke and dairy products at cheap rates in India,"" said a field expert.",ahmedabad,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74038984,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-754542,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/after-gloom-gujarat-is-milking-its-cows-again/articleshow/74035772.cms
240,['9/02/2020'],RTI activists condemn ‘blackmailer &amp; extortionist’ tag,"This story is from February 9, 2020

PUNE: Right to Information ( RTI ) activists have condemned government officials for calling them “blackmailers and extortionists”, while saying the tag only meant to dissuade them from seeking information under the act.

The activists have also urged the new government in the state to review the act, which came into force 14 years ago.

Former chief information commissioner Shailesh Gandhi has written a letter to chief minister Uddhav Thackeray , urging him to upload RTI queries and their responses online to leave no scope for any allegation. “This demand has been long pending and was put forth before the previous government as well,’’ he told TOI.

In the letter, Gandhi has also sought appointment of six information commissioners to overcome RTI case pendency. “The Rajasthan government has been doing it, then why can’t Maharashtra follow suit,’’ he asked.

In a recent RTI-related case filed by Anjali Bhardwaj, the Chief Justice of India (CJI) is reported to have said on December 16 that they were are not against the right to information but there was a need for guidelines and it cannot be “an unbridled right”. It has also been stated that there should be locus for seeking information, and that the administration is almost coming to a standstill because nobody was willing to take decisions.

The activists, however, said there was almost no known instance of government getting paralysed in legitimate work due to RTI. “RTI is a fundamental right of citizens under Article 19 (1)(a) and it stands to reason that the restrictions or curbs on the right to free speech, publishing and information must be uniform, and any curbs on one will apply to the others. The law also requires that most decisions should be taken in three levels and should be done within 45 days and if it is violated, it mandates disciplinary action against public servants,” an activist said.

Another activist Vijay Kumbhar said if the government was uploading all the information online, citizens would not have to procure information under the RTI Act. “Besides, the discretion of giving out information lies with the officials as under Section 8 they can choose to give or deny information considering the repercussions. So, RTI can never be used to blackmail,’’ he said, adding that in a democratic set-up, what was the need to hide information.

241,['9/02/2020'],PCMC to construct parallel Pimpri-Pimple Saudagar bridge,"This story is from February 9, 2020

PIMPRI CHINCHWAD: The civic body has finalized the design of a parallel bridge between Pimprigaon-Pimple Saudagar and is expected to commence construction by March 31, joint city engineer Shrikant Savane said.

Civic officials said the cost of the project was Rs12.56 crore.

The Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC) had constructed a two-lane bridge to link Pimprigaon with Pimple Saudagar around 30 years ago. Residents of Pimpri use this bridge to go to Rahatani, Pimple Gurav and Pimple Nilakh. The existing two-lane bridge has proved to be inadequate to handle the increasing vehicular traffic, resulting in snarls almost every day.

Pimpri resident Ramesh Shinde said, “The existing bridge needs to be repaired as it has developed potholes, causing hardship to commuters. PCMC must start construction of a parallel bridge at the earliest to ensure smooth flow of traffic.”

Pimple Saudagar resident Rakesh Kale said, “The new bridge should be constructed at the earliest for the convenience of commuters using the existing bridge to reach Pimpri Camp or Pimpri railway station and PCMC main building.”

When contacted, National Congress Party (NCP) corporator Vithal, alias Nana Kate , and NCP corporator Sheetal Kate from Pimple Saudagar said they had been pursuing the demand for a parallel bridge with PCMC for the past 10-15 years. “The existing bridge has only two lanes while approach roads on both the sides have four lanes. It leads to congestion and chaos at the merging point,” Kate said.

BJP corporator Sandeep Waghire from Pimpri said, “Once completed, the parallel bridge would become the first in the city to have a spectator’s gallery. Members of the Sindhi community, devotees of Sant Jhulelal, feed the fish in the river while standing on the bridge. They face hardships due to constant traffic on the bridge. A 6x14 metre gallery will be constructed on the bridge for the Sindhi community.”

CHANDIGARH: The UT electricity department ’s ambitious project under the Smart City Mission of conversion of existing overhead lines to the underground system and replacement of infrastructure in Sector 8, finally see ray of hope as four companies have come forward.

The UT in the past had floated tender on three occasions, but there were no bidders. But this time, four companies have participated in the tender and soon the administration will open financial bid of these companies, and accordingly will allot the work to successful bidder.

Already three years have passed, but the project failed to start in Chandigarh. The planning work on this project was started in January 2017 and the UT planned to carry out project after Chandigarh was selected as one of the fast-track cities under the Smart City Mission of the ministry of urban development, Government of India.

The UT administration had finalised project of conversion of existing overhead lines to the underground system and replacement of infrastructure in Sector 8. The Joint Electricity Regularity Commission (JERC) has already accorded approval for capital expenditure of Rs 17.89 crore for the project on pilot basis.

The department had picked Sector 8 as the existing infrastructure is about five decades old and frequently breaks down, especially during the peak summer season.

The project was a part of the UT electricity department’s 20-year roadmap for improving power infrastructure in the city.

As per the official record, there are five 33 KV sub-stations and thirteen 66 KV sub-stations located in different parts of the city. As per the laid down norms, a sub-station has a life span of 25 years. Around six 66 KV sub-stations have crossed their life span and the number of such sub-stations will continue to grow.

To address the problem, the department has prepared a detailed project report (DPR) for upgrading infrastructure which the department plans to execute in a phased manner in the next 20 years at a cost of Rs 2,773 crore.

As per the plan, a total of 12 new 66KV grid sub-stations will be established while all the existing 66KV sub-stations will be upgraded in the next 10 years. There is overhead transmission line of 2,037 km in the city, which will be converted into underground line.

The department has set a deadline of 10 years for completion of the work. There is also a plan to install new 1,825 distribution transformers.

243,['9/02/2020'],Veteran composer rues lack of good lyrics,"This story is from February 9, 2020

Usha Khanna.

PUNE: Usha Khanna was one of the few female music directors in the Hindi film industry for 30 years beginning in the late 1950s, composing for nearly 250 films across languages, and as per her account, she ‘wasted’ years convincing people she was indeed a composer.

“No one would believe that I had composed music for films. People I met thought that someone else had done the work. I wasted four years of my life over this,” she said, during an interaction with the press in the city.

Khanna is in the city to attend a live show in her honour on Sunday. She was scheduled to be in Pune last month to receive the SD Burman Award from the Pune International Film Festival (PIFF), but could not make it at the last minute. Among other recent honours, the state government accorded her the Lata Mangeshkar Award last year, recognizing her pioneering work as a female music director, who produced dozens of hit songs in an industry dominated by men.

Khanna has not composed music for films for quite a few years now. While she admires a few music directors these days, she is not quite a fan of contemporary film music.

“See, there is no change possible in the sargam. That will remain a constant. But I have never worked in this style of music. If there are no shayaris, or nice lyrics, there is not much fun in composing. Everything is in one style. There is no melody, and you can’t really figure out what a song is trying to convey, whether it’s comedy or romance or sadness. There are no good lyrics these days,” she rued.

The first Hindi feature film that music composer worked on was Dil Deke Dekho (1959). She went on to receive a Filmfare Award for composing the songs for Souten (1983).

Changes have been rife in the music industry since she stopped actively composing for films, such as the end of live orchestras and the move towards tracks and mixing. Also present is the mushrooming of talent shows to find new singers for the film industry. In that context, she says that young singers must be kept motivated for them to remain in music.

“At these talent shows, kids achieve name and fame in a short time. They don’t get time for riyaaz (practice) as kids, and they won’t have that time either when they grow up, as they will be expected to earn. The money that they get through these talent shows makes a big difference to their careers. I think that kids should be given such motivation that they should work in music for the rest of their lives,” Khanna signed off.

CHANDIGARH: Terming the UT’s draft notification for declaring Sukhna Lake as wetland as a violation of the Wetland (Conservation and Management) Rule, 2017, residents of Kansal have now approached the Union minister of environment Prakash Javadekar.

The residents, who have also submitted their objections to the UT’s draft notification, also wrote a letter to the Union minister stating that the draft notification by the UT administration was contrary to the Wetland (Conservation and Management) Rule, 2017, and devoid of scientific inputs.

The letter reads, “The MoEF guidelines clearly states the case of Trans boundaries, it shall be endeavour of all the state/UT along with stakeholders to have mutual consultation to decide upon the subject. In both (Sukhna Wildlife Sanctuary and Sukhna Wetland) cases there appears no consultation or coordination committee.”

The residents alleged that on account of lack of consultation and agreement between the UT, Punjab and Haryana, there were different views.

They also submitted that the scientific study of the area had been comprehensively completed by a world-class institute (National Institute of Hydrology, Roorkee) based on technical inputs by ISRO. Unfortunately, the UT administration ignored this study.

Recently, the UT administration had written to the Survey of India for latest map of Sukhna Lake and its catchment area that would be used in the final notification declaring Sukhna as a wetland.

In the draft notification, the Chandigarh administration had used Survey of India’s 2004 map, according to which, the area was surveyed and assessed in 1996-97. But one of the objections the UT received was the use of old map. Thereafter, the administration had written to the Survey of India to provide latest map with a scale 1:5,000.

However, sources have revealed that the Survey of India, in its response to the administration, has stated that such a map does not exist with them.

248,['9/02/2020'],"After rain, state braces for another round of cold wave","This story is from February 9, 2020

Bhubaneswar: If you were planning to pack up the woollens and get ready for the hot summer months, don’t do it yet. For the cold wave is set to return soon after the rain and cloud disappear.

The Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) has predicted that chilly weather conditions will continue till February 10 and there will be a further drop in temperature after the cloud cover clears.

“The rain and return of cold is due to a western disturbance. Besides, a low level easterly wind is instrumental in bringing back the chill. The situation became worse due to a cyclonic circulation in West Bengal and a trough line over Tamil Nadu and Chhattisgarh. These systems are causing extortions of moisture from the Bay of Bengal,” said H R Biswas, director of IMD’s Bhubaneswar centre.

On Saturday, thick fog engulfed several parts of the state which witnessed rain accompanied by cold winds. The fog affected road, rail and flight movement. A flight from Jharsuguda airport was cancelled due to bad weather while several trains got delayed due to early morning fog.

The met office has issued yellow warning for rain, thunderstorm with lightening and gusty surface wind in 13 coastal and interior districts in the next three days. “Besides, there will be dense fog in the districts of Sundagarh, Keonjhar, Jharsuguda, Bargarh, Kalahandi, Sonepur and Balangir,” the IMD bulletin said.

“After the cloud cover clears, cold wave conditions may return to some districts. Temperature may fall significantly in Angul and Sonepur districts,” said Biswas.

He further stated, “February is considered as the last month of winter and conditions like this is not very unusual. By the end of the month night temperature starts increasing while day temperature starts increasing much before that. But this winter has seen intermittent fall in temperature for short periods,” he pointed out.

Minimum temperature saw appreciable fall in the districts of coastal Odisha and was below normal. The highest maximum temperature of 32 degree Celsius was recorded at Malkangiri and the lowest minimum temperature of 11 degree Celsius was recorded at Sundergarh in the plains of Odisha. Keonjhar recorded highest rainfall of 22 mm between 8.30 am and 5.30 pm on Saturday.

The day temperature in Bhubaneswar plunged to 20.6 degree Celsius while minimum temperature fell down to 16.6 degree on Saturday. Due to bad weather, many people preferred to remain indoors while roads and markets wore a deserted look.

“It was a very unusual weather in Bhubaneswar, one very similar to North India. Cold winds are blowing throughout the day. The nights are quite cold. I had stored my woollens but have brought them out again with the chill’s return,” said Swastika Mishra, a private firm employee.

249,['9/02/2020'],City’s history on offer at restored lighthouse,"This story is from February 9, 2020

Visakhapatnam: Four years after the old lighthouse in Visakhapatnam was restored and thrown open to the public, the project has become a big hit, attracting a large number of tourists every year.

The Andhra Pradesh Tourism Development Corporation (APTDC) conducts a daily city tour, and the old lighthouse is the final destination on its itinerary. Apart from this, several private operators also conduct package tours to the lighthouse everyday.

“In the past four years, it has been observed that during peak season—November to March—APTDC receives 90 to 120 tourists every day. There are also private operators. The project is a big hit,” the spokesperson of the Visakha Container Terminal (VCT) said. The Visakhapatnam Port Trust, the custodian of the lighthouse, had roped in VCT for the restoration.

A sum of Rs 25 lakhs was spent to restore the lighthouse. VCT had appointed Vikash V Dilwari, a Mumbai-based conservationist, for consultation works on the project. The restored lighthouse was thrown open to the public in June 2015.

“The idea was quite clear. We wanted to restore the building in a fashion that replicated its original shape, size, design and colour. During the restoration, we ended up constructing a washroom within the compound for tourists which also replicates the original lighthouse design,” the VCT spokesperson added.

The 59-feet-tall lighthouse has an illustrious history. The British constructed the structure in 1903 on present-day Beach Road , facing the harbour. For the next 59 years, till 1962, it served as a lighthouse and guided ships to the harbour.

The lighthouse had a gas-fired white dioptre light of the second order. It flashed every 20 seconds and was visible up to a distance of 12 miles from the shore in clear weather. The dome and lantern of the lighthouse were visible from the lighthouse at Chantilly or Chintappal, 18 km from Bheemunipatnam.

During World War II, two anti-aircraft guns were set up next to the lighthouse. These guns were excavated when the tower was being restored. One of the guns is on display right next to lighthouse. The gas-fired light in the lighthouse could not be restored.

“All these buildings are living pages of the city’s history. Many port cities abroad have restored their old lighthouses and are showcasing them for tourists. I am happy Visakhapatnam has also done this and happier that I was part of the project,” said conservationist Dilwari.

Arvind Kejriwal

NEW DELHI: As Delhiites started queuing up in the morning, another battle was beginning to simmer in the virtual world with senior BJP functionaries taking turns to target chief minister Arvind Kejriwal and his Aam Aadmi Party .

Union minister Smriti Irani was quick to latch on to a tweet by the CM to label him “anti-women”. The trigger was an appeal by Kejriwal to women to come out in large numbers to exercise their franchise. “Special appeal to all women — just as you bear the responsibility at home, similarly the responsibility of Delhi and the country is on your shoulders. All you women must go vote and also take the men of your house. Make sure to discuss with the men who the right candidate will be to vote for (sic).”

Irani asked if Kejriwal considered women incapable of taking their own decisions. “Do you not consider women competent enough to independently decide who to vote for,” she tweeted. It drew an immediate response from Kejriwal, who said the women had already decided where their votes were going. “Smiriti ji, the women of Delhi have decided who they will vote for. They have made the decision for their entire family this time. Ultimately, it’s the women who have to run the household,” Kejriwal said.

A little later, Delhi BJP chief Manoj Tiwari retweeted a video of the CM taking off his shoes and garlanding an Hanuman idol “without washing his hands” and called him a “Chunaavi Hanuman Bhakt”. BJP MP Parvesh Sahib Singh Verma kept up the ante, claiming that the residents of Shaheen Bagh were voting for AAP and urged people to turn out in large numbers and vote for the “deshbhakt party”.

AAP leader Sanjay Singh slammed Tiwari for his remarks, dubbing it “politics of hate”. He said: “It has deeply hurt me...Tiwari is saying that by offering prayers, Kejriwal has turned Hanuman ji impure. They consider Kejriwal untouchable and look down upon him.”

BJP’s Verma claimed that AAP was arranging biryani for the Shaheen Bagh protesters and, as a result, they were voting for it. “People of Delhi, what I was saying for a long time... the media is also saying that today. People from a particular community from Shaheen Bagh, Jamia Millia and Seelampur are standing in long queues and proclaiming their support to AAP. Why would they not? AAP has been feeding them biryani for more than a month (sic),” Verma stated in a video message that he shared on Twitter.

He called it a mode of “repayment of loan” given by AAP and urged the people of Delhi to turn up in large numbers, vote for the “nationalist party” and shout “Jai Shri Ram”.

253,['9/02/2020'],BJP targets govt for razing guest house at heart of PEO death row,"This story is from February 9, 2020

Representative image

BHUBANESWAR: The demolition of an illegally constructed two-storied guest house in Charabatia village, under Haridaspur gram panchayat of Jajpur district , has triggered a row with the BJP slamming the state government for it. The guest house is where Smitarani Biswal, the panchayat executive officer (PEO) of Haridaspur, was found hanging in October last year. The guest house belonged to Rupesh Bhadra, husband of Haridaspur sarpanch Madhusmita Bhadra. Rupesh was arrested for abetting Smitarani’s suicide.

On Friday, the guest house was torn down, which BJP alleged was done by the state government to destroy evidence in connection with the PEO’s death.

Blaming the state government, senior BJP leader Lekhashree Samantsinghar said, “From circumstantial evidence, it seemed Smitarani was murdered. But the Jajpur SP did not deal with the case in an impartial manner. Now, the guest house has been demolished in a bid to destroy evidence. It is clear that the state government doesn’t want the truth behind the incident to come out in the open.”

Senior BJD leader Subash Singh said the BJP is trying to politicise the issue. “The guest house was demolished because it was an unauthorized construction. The investigation is going in the right direction and as per law,” he said.

Earlier, the BJP had demanded action against the Jajpur SP as he had gone on record to claim the deceased had illicit relationship with Rupesh. “The police are mandated to ascertain the cause of death and not cast aspersion on the deceased at the beginning of the investigation,” BJP had then said.

The husband of the deceased had also pointed fingers at Rupesh and had denied the suicide angle. Smitarani’s father Sadananda Biswal had also lodged a complaint with Dharmasala police alleging that his daughter was murdered.

254,['9/02/2020'],AIBEA meets in Pune to launch national campaign against 'bank blunders',"This story is from February 9, 2020

PUNE: The All India Bank Employees Association (AIBEA) met in Pune on Saturday as part of a national campaign to create awareness about the “series of wrong steps that the government is taking in respect to public sector banks”.

Blighted by the government's move to merge public sector banks, AIBEA general secretary, C.H. Venkatachalam said, ""such mergers do not benefit the public."" He said that even the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) has become a back door channel to give clean chit to promoters.

“IBC is a sham. Earlier at least the wilful defaulters were charged to the extent that they were not give other loans…Now, under the resolution process only the company is declared insolvent and sold at a discount (haricut) and the promoter goes scot free,” he said.

Citing six resolutions under the code, he said, that the bank’s have taken haircut of as much as 95% -- generally favouring big corporate groups. The average haircut that banks took in six cases was 46%, AIBEA said.

“All this money foregone is recovered from common people by the way of service charges, minimum balance charges, lower interest on deposits and higher interest on loans, among others,” the general secretary said.

The officials of the association said that customers do not benefit from bank mergers and instead there is a cut in the number of branches, at a time when more people are enrolled into banking.

“We have rallied against mergers since 2004 and so, it has taken a long time. Otherwise these mergers would have happened long back…similarly the government had to withdraw the Financial Resolution and Deposit Insurance (FRDI) Bill after the unions opposed,” Venkatachalam said, when asked about the effectiveness of one or two-day bank strikes in the time of alternate banking.

AIBEA also criticised the economic survey’s reference of public sector bank’s as “inefficient”.

“Yes, there is room for improvement in PSBs, but nowhere else are so many non-bank related services pushed through the banks,” said Devidas Tuljapurkar, joint secretary of the All India Bank Employees Association (AIBEA).

'Wage settlement close to fruition'

AIBEA general secretary, C.H.Venkatachalam, said that the delayed wage settlement is close to fruition.

“Last time, we settled the 2012 settlement in May 2015. This time, we still have 2-3 months for the 2017 wage settlement,” he said, adding, “it is close to completion”.

About 7-8 lakh employees of the public sector banks have been waiting for enhanced salaries since November 2017 and the delay has become a pattern.

“My priority is to sign the agreement. No one is really bothered about the wages of employees. So along with national issues, this is one of the issues we will finish first,” he said.

Filipe Neri Ferrao

PANAJI: Archbishop of Goa Filipe Neri Ferrao , on behalf of the Catholic community in the state, released a strongly-worded statement on Saturday appealing to the Centre to “immediately and unconditionally revoke the Citizenship Amendment Act ( CAA ) and desist from implementing the National Register of Citizens (NRC) and the National Population Register”.

“The very fact that the CAA uses religion goes against the secular fabric of the country,” he said.

Urging the government to “listen to the voice of millions in India”, Ferrao said the recently enacted CAA and the proposed NRC and the intended NPR is causing “great concern and anguish” to millions of Indians spread throughout the world.

He said the CAA, the NRC and the NPR “are divisive and discriminatory” and would certainly have a “negative and damaging effect on a multi-cultural democracy like ours”.

Ferrao said the NRC and the NPR exercises would result in “a direct victimisation” of the underprivileged classes, “particularly the dalits, adivasis, migrant labourers, nomadic communities and the countless undocumented people who, after having been recognised as worthy citizens and voters for more than 70 years in this great nation, will suddenly run the risk of becoming stateless and candidates for detention camps in their teeming millions”.

He said Christians in India have always been a peace-loving community and deeply committed to the ideals of justice, liberty, equality and fraternity, enshrined in the Constitution of India.

“It is observed, sadly, that these initiatives issuing forth from the government are forecasting a systematic erosion of the values, principles and rights which have been guaranteed to all citizens under our Constitution, and which citizens are called to protect and promote,” he said.

The archbishop said he would pray for the country and “that good sense, justice and peace prevail in the hearts and minds of all”.

In all, 42,000 personnel from Delhi Police, 190 companies of CAPF and 19,000 from Home Guard were deployed

NEW DELHI: Petty fights and verbal duels between members of political parties and jostling by voters were reported from various places during the assembly polls on Saturday. However, none of the incidents were termed serious by police. Most tiffs were resolved by the cops on the spot.

Tempers rose at a polling booth in Neb Sarai in Sangam Vihar assembly constituency where some voters complained about the narrow entrance to a school and tried to force their way in. Policemen had to push some of them out and open the school gate for the crowd to enter.

A senior police officer said there was a sudden rush of voters after 4pm at the government school, which had led to the ruckus. However, it was controlled within a short period. The police control room received 223 election-related calls till 6pm. The calls ranged from “putting more tables” to “seeking help for transportation”, “canvassing inside restricted area”, “quarrel among party workers” and “not being permitted to cast vote”.

Heated arguments took place between voters and poll officials at Inderpuri over delay in voting. People also got into an altercation with policemen posted there over the same issue.

In total, 42,000 personnel from Delhi Police , 190 companies of CAPF and 19,000 Home Guard were deployed for the elections. Senior officers personally supervised the arrangements on directions of the Election Commission. Special emphasis was given to area dominance, critical polling stations and booths and borders were strengthened to ensure security.

Haridwar: A week after Matri Sadan seer Padmavati, who had been on an indefinite fast for the cause of ‘Clean Ganga’, was lifted by the police and admitted to Doon Hospital, another seer, Gopal Das on Saturday, announced to sit on a hunger strike to push for the same demands.

Das had been on a similar indefinite hunger strike in October, 2018 as well. In the same year, he had also written to Prime Minister Narendra Modi in blood to protect the river. However, after nearly 165 days of fasting, he was lifted by police and taken to PGI Chandigarh and later to AIIMS Delhi. Subsequently, he went missing and was thereafter found in South India.

Gopal Das told TOI that “under my Deal-to-Death revolution, I will sit outside the CM’s house and stage a protest very soon.” “I have fasted for 165 days and even after the death of professor GD Agrawal, I continued fasting. I will not allow his sacrifice to go in vain. Both the central and state governments are playing games with the holy Ganga in the name of Namami Gange.” He added that his protest will continue till the government brings a Ganga Act.

However, Matri Sadan ashram functionaries said that they are not associated with Gopal Das. “He has never been a part of Matri Sadan ashram. In 2018, we allowed him to use our premises for meditation (tapasya) after his request. The permission was given in good faith as he had been fasting for Ganga and his aim coincided with late professor GD Agrawal’s demands,” said Matri Sadan seer Dayanand. He added that Matri Sadan has no information regarding the hunger strike announcement made by Das.

259,['9/02/2020'],Won’t allow anti-CAA floats at carnival: CCP,"This story is from February 9, 2020

PANAJI: The Corporation of the City of Panaji (CCP) announced on Saturday that protest floats, particularly those depicting CAA or NRC, will not be permitted to participate at this year’s edition of the Goa carnival float parade.

“Festivals like carnival are not a place to protest,” said CCP commissioner Sanjit Rodrigues . “People who wish to protest in favour of or against CAA/NRC can do so at Azad Maidan in Panaji; we will grant them permission.”

The CCP, as per its rules and regulations, usually discourages the depiction of religious and political themes, figures or personalities.

The annually-held Goa carnival float parade sees an array of tableau showcasing Goa’s art, culture and rural life. In recent years, the event has also opened its platform for commercial floats, wherein brands can showcase themselves.

This year, however, CCP has cracked a whip on such tableau too.

Rules state that the products of a sponsoring company should not form the main part of the float, and that the tableau must have a cultural theme.

Brands will therefore not be allowed to liberally promote their products at this year’s float parade in Panaji.

“Branding can be done, but direct cutouts of products should not be projected in front of, back of, or on top of the float. This is not a product display festival,” Rodrigues said. “Brands can only feature their logo or banner on the sides of the floats.”

All floats desirous of participating this year will therefore have to be pre-approved by the CCP. Goa celebrates carnival from February 22 to 25.

260,['9/02/2020'],"In Bhadrawati Ordnance Factory, it is tigers and leopards which are on a safari","This story is from February 9, 2020

Chandrapur: A healthy prey base in the forest swath on the premises of Ordnance Factory in Bhadrawati has turned it into an ideal habitat for wild predators. Tigers, leopards and bears are being frequently sighted in the civilian area under factory.

There is a thick forest on either side of the road in the factory. A majestic tiger talking a royal walk or sudden flash of leopard across the road has become quite common.

According to sources, the OF area is spread over 7,500 acres. Apart from the walled manufacturing unit and magazine (store house), there is residential colony for officers and staffers. The remaining area is a dense forest with rich sources of water and prey base. “While cycling, I saw a tiger sitting on the road a few hundred yards ahead just 15 days back. Bears, leopards, Indian gaurs, spotted deer and wild rabbits are frequently sighted in the area,” said businessman Shekhar Singh.

Singh said that other than killing of a small girl named Ankita on the road a few years back and charging at bikes, no untoward incident has taken place so far. “Over half a dozen leopards who had intruded in the area have been captured in the last few years,” he claimed but also feared there could a wild animal attack due to presence of large predators in the area.

“Though locals have become used to the sightings, they have also grown cautious of close presence of predators around their residences,” said Dr Pravin Keshwani, who works in the hospital in OF. He claimed that people have stopped going out for morning and evening walks and take all precautions while stepping out in the night. In fact, a leopard had intruded in the OF hospital building a few years back.

The recent poaching of leopards and bears in the factory area also points towards flaring up of man-animal conflict. CCF, Chandrapur, SV Ramarao who recently had a meeting with general manger of OF, Chanda, said that the situation is even more volatile than Chandrapur Super Thermal Power Station (CSTPS), where tigers have been sighted since couple of years, as there is no exact estimation of predators in the area.

“The forest under OF area is quite large and in continuation with buffer forest. Also, a porous boundary allows uninterrupted entry and exit of wild animals. The forest is under OF management jurisdiction. We have suggested mitigation measures to the OF management and assured our full support,” he said.

Wildlife NGOs have alleged lapses in security after poaching of leopards and bears. OF officials claimed that protecting people from wild animals is responsibility of forest department.

As per regulations, Defence Security Corp (DSC) is responsible for protection of walled area of ammunition manufacture and its storage and transport. Keeping wild animals in check, nabbing poachers and keeping thieves away from civilian area are jobs related to forest and police departments.

The production unit and magazine are secured location guarded by army men and there are no security lapses, officials claimed and added that DSC is cooperating with forest and police officials in curbing the menace of poachers. They, however, said it’s far-fetched to expect DSC men to walk around the forested areas to catch poachers.

Representative image

HYDERABAD: After the cybercrime case in which six fraudsters were nabbed for availing instant loans and credit cards in the name of four IT professionals who died in accidents last year, the Cyberabad police plan to write to Reserve Bank of India ( RBI ) and banks and ask them to make the verification process stricter.

“If a person can hack into your net banking account, they can easily apply for an instant pre-approved loan and credit card with a pre-approved limit. All they have to provide is the correct phone number and e-mail address. The bank will check the CIBIL score and accordingly transfer money within minutes or maximum, hours,” said ACP cybercrime, Cyberabad, Y Srinivas Kumar.

The accused persons used the same trick to cheat over Rs 53 lakh by impersonating the deceased IT professionals, who had decent CIBIL scores. “Now applying for loans and the credit cards has become easy, as everything can be applied for online and no physical verification is required. The offenders are taking advantage of it,” said the officer.

The case came to light when a victim’s wife discovered that her dead husband’s phone number was blocked. The victim, Raghuram worked at Infosys, and had died in September last year.

“When she approached the service provider, she discovered that the same number was active on another SIM card. She grew suspicious and was approached by bank officials to clear credit card dues,” said the ACP.

According to cops, the banks need to carry out physical verification for approving loans and credit cards, and the verification procedure has to be more complex. “The banks are choosing speed over safety. They need to have stricter procedures,” said the officials.

PANAJI : Of the 63 opioids users undergoing treatment at the North Goa district hospital in Mapusa , seven have relapsed since the season started while one has died of an overdose. Doctors at the hospital’s drug treatment centre (DTC) point to a relation between the tourist season and relapses.Monsoon is the tourist off season in the state and during this period narcotics become difficult to source, and to tide the period drug users turn to the centre’s Methadone Maintenance Treatment (MMT), medical officer and psychiatrist at DTC Dr Ravindra Patil said.“They go back to doing drugs when the season starts. That’s how, we see more patients during the monsoon months than at any other time of the year, and see more relapse patients during the tourist season,” Patil said.Since November 2019, the start of tourist season in the state, the DTC has seen several relapse cases besides two drug overdose cases and one death.Patil said the patient who died used to attend the clinic on and off. “He had been arrested for peddling drugs and died of an overdose the day he was released on bail. We suspect he might have used hard drugs, which he was not able to use while in prison,” he said.“Many drug users work in the tourism industry. It is but natural they will do drugs when they see their friends who are also users,” said Rihan, 23, who has been on MMT for about a year-and-a-half.Most patients relapse and some more than once. The rate of relapse is higher than success in terms of patients not touching drugs for a year or more. Patil said their task is a difficult one, and that they try to help their patients stay away from drugs as much as possible. “We aim at harm reduction rather than de-addiction,” he said.Over 90% of the patients who relapse offer a common reason. “They blame it either on a break-up or betrayal in love,” Patil said.One drug user, who recently overdosed but was saved, pleaded with the doctors at the centre to speak to his girlfriend and help him reconcile with her. “The users don’t require a reason to use drug. They will find something or someone to blame when asked to explain,” Patil said.When asked Rihan said he went back to drugs after a break-up. “My girlfriend at that time had left me and two days later I was at a party. So I told myself I’ll use drugs only once. But believe me, it never stops at that one shot,” he said.At the clinic is a young couple, Ravi and Neena, who are parents to a two-year-old girl. Neena said she picked the drug habit from her husband as she could not cope with her mother-in-law. Their inter-religious marriage is a bone of contention in Ravi’s family.“I sought relief in drugs as I could not handle his mum,” Neena said. While she is doing well, Ravi relapsed after a fight at home.“Both complain against each other. I keep telling them to at least look at their daughter,” said Patil, who also counsels patients and helps them sort their domestic issues.Drug uses will also go to any length to support their addiction.A twenty-something Nikhil Marathe said he was advised by his drug using friends to forge a doctor’s prescription to secure morphine if he was in difficult. “I once pinched a prescription from a doctor’s clinic. Scribbled the name of the drug I wanted and signed it. I got the drug without raising any suspicion,” he said.But whether a regular or occasional user, all face the risk of overdose with chances being the highest for those using multiple drugs.“Those using multiple substances such as cocaine, heroin, weed and alcohol face higher risk of overdose. They start with alcohol and smoking cannabis. Next, they chase or sniff cocaine and later will go for a fix of the hard drug heroin. If by mistake more heroin is injected than what the body can handle the user can die of an overdose unless timely medical help is administered,” Patil said.An overdose can also happen if the substance consumed is spurious, he said.",goa,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74040502,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-151804,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/at-mapusa-rehab-off-season-is-peak-time/articleshow/74035833.cms

Exploring this untapped potential, Ahmedabad-based entrepreneur, Neel Kotak, founded Iscon Balaji Foods, roped in farmers to manufacture potato flakes, using undersized potatoes. A huge chunk of unutilized potatoes was brought to use, thus boosting farmer’s income.Past JourneyA BTech in chemical engineering from IIT Bombay, Neel Kotak, managing director, Iscon Balaji Foods, started the company in 2012, primarily to address farmer’s concerns. “The income of farmers grew by 20% when the potato flakes were supplied to companies that manufactured namkeen. Keeping the aim of boosting farmer’s income, we further diversified our business into manufacturing frozen french fries in 2016. We encouraged farmers to farm for the processing variety of potato, which yielded them better income,” he said.As on date, IBF owns nearly 35% market share in the Hotel, Restaurant and Catering segment of India for supplying french fries. “We’re getting more and more farmers on our platform through contract farming agreements. We supply them seeds, and our team helps and monitors the health of the crop and we buy back the crop at a pre-approved price; which helps farmers secure their income from market disturbances,” he added.The french fries, manufactured at the company’s plant are not just supplied to the Indian market but also exported to middle east and south east Asian countries. As on date, the company works with some 5,000 potato farmers in Gujarat and Punjab and clocks revenue of Rs 230 crore.Next StepsBeing an exporter of frozen potato-based products to more than 14 countries, the company’s next challenge is to increase productivity and expand to other markets. “We plan to begin exporting to more countries and focus on the European and US markets in the next phase,” said Kotak.ChallengesImproving productivity of farmers from time to time is a challenge, according to Kotak. “A lot needs to be done at the ground-level to improve productivity and yield of farmers and ensuring that their income grows,” he said.Secret to SuccessPrioritizing long-term relationship with farmers and stakeholders at all levels over short-term gains is something that has clicked right since the company’s inception believes Kotak. “Helping all stakeholders grow is the only way our company will grow and that is what has worked for us over the years,” said Kotak.",ahmedabad,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-47529300,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-110164,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/turning-small-potatoes-into-big-biz/articleshow/74035870.cms

The reasons are many and varied, but young men like Chandrashekar are at the forefront of turning the tide for ballet — once considered the domain of the feminine — as they realise its paybacks are more far-reaching than just physical agility and fitness, which are just the tip of the iceberg.

Twenty-four year-old Milton Obadhia for instance, joined dancer-choreographers Gowtham Sundararajan and Kokila Hariram’s Academy of Modern Danse in Chennai, to learn hip-hop (the popular culture style that has caught the fancy of most young men in dance according to the couple). But six years into learning ballet — that Gowtham and Kokila offer as a mandatory foundational course — Milton still wants to pursue and teach hip-hop and contemporary dance, but cannot imagine doing that without the strong spine of ballet backing him. ""Its tough, structured techniques make it easier to learn any other dance form,"" he says. ""Elements like pirouettes — the act of spinning on one foot, and the jumps — help tremendously while learning styles like jazz.""

Kokila says while most of their boys shrug off ballet when they’re young, they invariably come back to learning again when they’re older and want to find a career in dance. ""Because there’s nothing that strengthens your core and technique the way this does. A grade four in jazz could is equal to a grade one in ballet, for instance,"" she says.

Another student of theirs, Chiraag R, is a classic example. The 22-year-old joined them with his heart set on jazz, and later moved to Salsa, which he now wishes to pursue seriously. But if there has been a constant, it has been ballet. ""I see it as a pivotal element in all forms of dance,"" he says. ""It opens up your body and makes you stronger, so you look stronger too, especially when you are holding your partner in Salsa. You are also so much more confident and presentable,"" he says.

Because what’s really happening when you practice on the barre is that you get an excellent understanding of your body and your central gravity,"" says Gowtham. ""Your joints open up and your mobility increases. Many times, we have skaters and gymnasts training in ballet from us for these reasons.""

Teachers in the city say that while more young male dancers training professionally are taking to ballet, popular perception still needs to change, particularly among parents of young boys. ""Although both men and women play prominent roles in classical ballet, many parents want their sons to learn an on-field sport or something ‘more masculine’ in the long run,"" says Ann. ""But I explain to them that a ballet dancer isn’t just equipped with the technique and skill of a sportsperson but refines it into something beautiful, smooth and fluid to watch. The man has to be extremely strong as the athleticism here is harnessed and refined. If you’re doing a leap in a track event, you can fall, kick and shout, but when you leap in ballet, you have to be graceful, as if emulating the movement of a bird soaring freely through the air.""

It was this innate grace and skill that caught the eye of Israeli-American classical ballet master Yehuda Maor in two Mumbai boys, Amiruddin Shah and Manish Chauhan, and inspired him to mentor them. Amiruddin, son of a welder, and Manish, a former stuntman, also demonstrated what passion and flair in the dance form could do when they bagged scholarships to the Oregon Ballet Theatre School in the US and went on to perform at some of the finest ballet theatres there.

""In Asia, there is great demand for men in ballet, because they are so few,"" says Kokila. ""Many hesitate to take it up professionally because it’s tedious and intensive. But, if you set your mind to it, you can travel and perform extensively, or be picked up by prestigious dance companies in the UK, the US and Singapore. The road ahead is versatile and rewarding,""

267,['9/02/2020'],IAS officers take over probe of Kasnasur-Boriya encounters,"This story is from February 9, 2020

Nagpur: The magisterial inquiries of the country’s biggest encounters of Maoists at Kasnasur where 34 of their cadres were killed on April 22, 2018, followed by another at Nainer the next day, where six were gunned down by Gadchiroli police, are now being conducted afresh by IAS officers to expedite the investigations. The inquiries, which are already delayed by almost two years, were left midway by the sub-divisional magistrates (SDMs) who moved out to join in their posting keeping the inquiries incomplete.

There are around 10 magisterial inquiries, instituted under the provisions of 176 Criminal procedure code (CrPC) by the Gadchiroli collector following police encounters in which alleged Maoists were gunned down, that have been pending in the district for a period of around two years including the crucial ones of Kasnasur at Etapalli and another at Nainer in Aheri talukas. Out of the 10, half of the inquiries entrusted with the Aheri SDM have been pending.

The vacancies in the official posts and the two elections, general and state in 2019, were cited as the most cogent reasons for the delay in the inquiries which were to be completed by SDMs in a “time-bound” manner.

Incumbent collector Deepak Singla, who has ordered to expedite the inquiries, have said there would be free and fair probes conducted into the encounters without any influence or bias. “Two inquiries of Aheri would be wrapped up soon while one at Kurkheda is on the verge of completion with only the statement of the doctor is awaited,” he said.

Singla also admitted about the complexities in the Kasnasur and Boriya encounters which were fraught with allegations despite the national limelight it had brought for the Gadchiroli’s elite commando force of C-60. The encounters had catapulted the C-60 commando unit to the top slot in the country overshadowing the earlier best of the Telangana’s Greyhounds.

“The encounters of Kasnasur and Boriya have been started afresh by two IAS officers who are in their first posting. Given the gravity and complexities of the encounters, their inquiries would take time and expected to be over in the next two-three months. Since the inquiries are to be conducted in the public domain, there would be complete fair practices followed. I have instructed the IAS officers to conduct the inquiries in a transparent manner as their findings may be sought through the RTI Act,” he said.

After the last encounter in Gadchiroli on November 30, 2019, near Modmetta close to Maharashtra-Chhattisgarh border in Bhamragarh tehsil, where two alleged Maoists were killed, Gadchiroli polices’ C-60 commandos had come under heavy criticism for having bumped off villagers on the pretext of taking action against the Reds. Apart from magisterial inquiries, police also had to institute a separate inquiry under Addl SP, Aheri, Manish Kalbaniya, an IPS officer.

NEW DELHI: Young volunteers rose to the occasion to make polling a reasonably comfortable experience for the wheelchair-bound and ageing voters . The capital has taken the lead in making elections accessible, but a visit to some polling stations revealed the distance yet to be travelled to make elections disabled- and age-friendly.It is no surprise that the polling centre at the Leprosy Complex in northeast Delhi’s Tahirpur area would have a high number of voters who suffer from leprosy and are wheelchair-bound. Volunteers didn’t have a moment to breathe as they wheeled-in one voter after another, hampered by insufficient numbers of wheelchairs and one even non-functional.Complete Coverage on Delhi Elections“Given the centre’s location, there should have been large numbers of wheelchairs and volunteers. We feel bad since there are only so many voters we can help at a time,” said a volunteer who didn’t wish to be identified. “One wheelchair is damaged, making our jobs tougher,” he said.“I don’t have a leg and I have been in queue for over an hour. There should be some special facilities for us so that we don’t have to stand for so long in queues,” said Rehman (40), a resident of the complex. Phool Chand (35), who has lost his fingers and legs to leprosy, sat on the floor helpless, waiting for the crowd to thin so he could crawl his way into the booth. “Volunteers are all busy, there is no one to help me and I don’t know how long I will have to wait,”he said, watching the few volunteers running around.In RK Puram, too it was left to the volunteers who had to compensate for the lack of a ramp at a booth. Disabled voters had to be aided to climb a few stairs before they could be ferried on wheelchairs.A 65-year-old man with a fractured leg spoke highly of the volunteers in his Laxmi Nagar booth. “I was undecided about going to vote, but my family helped me go. And volunteers immediately helped once I reached, taking me in a wheelchair to the booth.”Across the city in Madangir, Poonam Devi, partially paralysed for five years, was helped by her husband Laxmi Narayan to reach her poll station. Her speech impaired, she was helped as she walked to the booth and cast her vote.

271,['9/02/2020'],"Ponzi scheme busted in Panaji, 4 held for duping 400","This story is from February 9, 2020

Representative Image

PANAJI: Goa police on Saturday busted a ponzi scheme in which over 400 people across seven states were duped of over Rs 1 crore in just a month. The police also arrested four people, including the scheme’s masterminds from Telangana and Tamil Nadu. The four cheated customers by promising returns of 3% per day, while also wooing them with luxury sedans to get new customers.

SP Shobhit Saksena of the Goa police’s economic offences cell told TOI that the four cheated people in Goa, Karnataka, Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh and Telangana.

The four accused were earlier real estate agents, and then became ‘agents’ in other ponzi schemes in Andhra Pradesh and Maharahstra. “This time they decided to start their own scheme,” Saksena said.

Saksena said that the incident came to light when they received a complaint from one Ismail Munshi, who invested Rs 10,000 in a scheme run by a company called Dreams2Reality . It accepted deposits from persons ranging from Rs 10,000 to Rs 5,00,000, and promised daily returns up to 3% along with air tickets to Goa, free entry into casinos, and hotel stays.

It also offered investors additional benefits like iPhones, scooters, motorcycles and German luxury cars. The complainant further told police that the ‘company’ didn’t get provide receipts for investments, and their entire functioning was online, on a website that functioned like a casino.

Saksena said that the accused persons promised investors that they would invest the money through casino operators and daily customers, and delivered daily interest between Rs 100 and Rs 200.

The EOC then found that Dreams2Reality ran its office at Patto, Panaji , in the guise of a travel agency.

“It had no permission from RBI, SEBI or any other regulating agency for accepting deposits or investment,” said Saksena. “Nor was any investment being made when their suspected bank accounts were analysed and the money circulating between various accounts of the fraudsters was being paid back to investors to build confidence in the scheme and draw more investors.”

The Goa police then filed an FIR under relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code and other laws. After that, the EOC raided all the fraudsters’ known premises — their rented place of residence at Kadamba plateau, and their office at Patto. Four persons — Dasarath Boora, the mastermind, Adi Ganesh, the head of the company, Fakruddin, their Goa agent, and Sandeep, their IT expert — were arrested.

“One Goan woman called Shweta was also involved in their marketing operations in Goa, and her involvement is also being verified,” Saksena said.

Saksena also said that all known bank accounts of the fraudsters have been frozen. “Since the scheme was less than a month old, a major loss of hard-earned money was prevented by the swift action of Goa police’s EOC,” he said.

Upon interrogation of the accused persons, it was established that although they had fashioned their scheme as a scheme for investment in casino games, it was actually a money circulating, multi-level marketing and ponzi scheme where they just transferred parts of funds received as investments from new customers to old ones.

“They stated that they started the scheme in Goa after they came to the state in September 2019,” Saksena said. “They hatched a plan to exploit the unique and attractive casino tourism of Goa by offering people outside Goa to be able to play and invest in these casinos.”

As per the plan, they were going to accept investments for up to three months, and when they estimated they would have made around Rs 5 crore, they would simply have shut shop and absconded with people’s hard-earned money. “They promises investors that they would double the amount invested,” Saksena said.

Hyderabad: A shepherd, who created a flutter by opening fire at his neighbour with an AK-47 over a petty fight, had hid the assault rifle in an empty drum in his Akkannapet village home for the last three years, police learnt during investigation.

The AK-47 was the same weapon which had gone missing from Husnabad police station. The accused, Sadanandam, who was picked up on Friday, was formally arrested on Saturday and sent to judicial remand. Police, however, are still not sure as to how the AK-47 ended up in his hands.

“There are inconsistencies in Sadanandam’s statement during our investigation on how he got the AK-47. We are yet to come to any conclusion. He will be taken into custody with court permission to probe the matter further,’’ a senior police official told STOI.

After nabbing the accused, cops recovered the AK-47, a magazine containing 25 live rounds, one 9 mm carbine gun and a sword from his residence. Police, however, are unwilling to confirm whether any photographs of Sadanandam with policemen were seized.

GUWAHATI: A day after Prime Minister Narendra Modi said in Kokrajhar that there have been attempts to mislead the people of Assam and the northeast over the CAA, All Assam Students’ Union ( Aasu ) chief adviser Samujjal Bhattacharyya hit back at the PM on Saturday by saying that people opposing CAA are more patriotic than those supporting the Act.

Addressing an anti-CAA rally at Pathsala in lower Assam’s Barpeta district, Bhattacharyya said people voicing concern over CAA love their state and their nationalism and affection for the nation cannot be questioned.

He added that the Centre cannot “bargain with anti-CAA agitators” by granting constitutional safeguards to the indigenous communities of Assam by implementing Clause 6 of the Assam Accord.

On Saturday, Aasu and 30 other allied organisations took out torch rallies against CAA across district headquarters of the state. Significantly, AGP MLA and party vice-president Pabindra Kumar Deka also joined the protest rally.

NEW DELHI: From providing tokens and seats to voters to all-women and all-disabled teams managing polling stations—there were several special and model polling stations set up by the Election Commission this assembly polls. While there were a total of 70 ‘pink’ stations with waiting areas, creches and first-aid rooms, the west Delhi constituency had some ‘special’ stations.

In Uttam Nagar constituency, Nigam Pratibha Vidyalaya stood out from a distance. Covered in pink balloons and red carpets, the booth resembled a wedding venue. Those entering were being provided ‘tokens’ and instead of standing in a queue, voters were asked to take a seat. They were allowed to go inside and vote based on their token numbers that were getting displayed on large screens. The exercise was aimed at reducing the waiting time, said an official.

Ravinder Kumar, a resident of Bindapur, said that the idea was novel and should have been replicated across more polling stations.

Voters could also get ‘mehendi’ applied on their hands here. In another corner, schoolchildren were busy exhibiting their projects.

The government senior secondary co-ed school in Dwarka’s Sector-22 had only women inside, while the polling team at Oxford Public School in Vikaspuri only included disabled staff.

At the Kirara polling booth, an inflatable outdoor bouncing carnival ride kept the kids busy as the parents went inside to cast their votes. Selfie stations were a huge hit and the women voters even got a tiny teddy memento as a return gift. “Never expected anything like that,” said 41-year-old Deepa Gupta.

While there were a total of 70 ‘pink’ stations with waiting areas, creches and first-aid rooms, the west Delhi constituency had some ‘special’ stations.In Uttam Nagar constituency, Nigam Pratibha Vidyalaya stood out from a distance. Covered in pink balloons and red carpets, the booth resembled a wedding venue. Those entering were being provided ‘tokens’ and instead of standing in a queue, voters were asked to take a seat. They were allowed to go inside and vote based on their token numbers that were getting displayed on large screens. The exercise was aimed at reducing the waiting time, said an official.Ravinder Kumar, a resident of Bindapur, said that the idea was novel and should have been replicated across more polling stations.Voters could also get ‘mehendi’ applied on their hands here. In another corner, schoolchildren were busy exhibiting their projects.The government senior secondary co-ed school in Dwarka’s Sector-22 had only women inside, while the polling team at Oxford Public School in Vikaspuri only included disabled staff.At the Kirara polling booth, an inflatable outdoor bouncing carnival ride kept the kids busy as the parents went inside to cast their votes. Selfie stations were a huge hit and the women voters even got a tiny teddy memento as a return gift. “Never expected anything like that,” said 41-year-old Deepa Gupta.",elections,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74037630,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-145166,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//elections/assembly-elections/delhi/how-these-booths-made-women-voters-feel-special/articleshow/74035894.cms
280,['9/02/2020'],Sunshine in my drink,"This story is from February 9, 2020

Chennai: Some time ago, the West discovered turmeric latte, the ‘haldi doodh’ grandmothers believed was the panacea for all ailments on account of its anti-inflammatory properties. And now, Indian mixologists are using the golden powder to create drinks of a different kind — turmeric cocktails, which are now the buzz in bars across the country and abroad.

When Kiron Kumar, director, food and beverage, The Park Chennai, wanted to do something different for Pongal, he came up with the idea of creating ‘ayurvedic cocktails’. The ‘spiritual high’ menu features ‘underground magic’ – a drink made of turmeric-infused handmade gluten-free vodka, carrot juice, honey, fresh lime, and angostura bitters.

""We used ingredients commonly used in Ayurveda, such as sandalwood, nannari, and turmeric to create cocktails,"" says Kumar, adding that though each ingredient has medicinal qualities, it changes once alcohol is added.

""We use the root to give the cocktail an earthy flavour, and fresh aroma,"" says Kumar, adding that it works well with neutral spirits, such as vodka. ""They don’t have a specific flavour profile, so they pick up any flavour added to it.""

‘Golden rain’ is the signature cocktail at Mumbai-based Talli Turmeric, said to be the country’s first turmeric-centric restaurant. ""It’s a mix of vodka, turmeric syrup (equal parts of turmeric powder and water), all-spice syrup (cardamom, star anise and cloves), lime juice and a dash of Angostura bitters,"" says Mansij Vaidya, co-founder, Innovative Culinary Concept He says the place uses 100% organic turmeric powder.

""We believe in championing the golden spice, so we wanted to let it shine not only in our food but also in our cocktails. Turmeric adds a distinctive edge to the taste of the cocktail and lends the drink it’s signature yellow shade,"" he says, adding that turmeric as an ingredient is so versatile, it has the potential of working well with all kinds of cocktails.

Chipstead at Taj Coromandel also offers ‘Curcumin indianna’ on request. Pomegranate juice is mixed with the turmeric paste (collected from the root) and cooked along with jaggery to convert it into a thick syrup used as the sweetener. ""This cocktail was basically made to make Campari a favourite drink among the masses. The addition of Indian ingredients like jaggery and turmeric were used to bring more traditional flavours and aromas to the cocktail,"" says Arun Kumar D, bar supervisor.

City-based beverage consultant Harinath Shankar has worked with the golden ingredient while crafting the drinks menu at Barracuda Brew, which opened in Nungambakkam a month ago. The concept of the bar is to go back to the roots of Madras and see how culture evolved around food and drinks. ""We found that seven spices — pepper, chillies, cardamom, cloves, nutmeg, mace, and turmeric — were exported from Madras to the rest of the world, so we took the spices as heroes and made drinks around them,"" he says.

281,['9/02/2020'],"Chennai: Olive Ridley season begins on bright note, 6 juveniles spotted","This story is from February 9, 2020

An injured turtle being treated at a hatchery in Chennai.

CHENNAI: Sea turtle conservationists are a happy lot this season. The sighting of half-a-dozen juvenile Olive Ridleys along the city’s coast in just over a fortnight has given rise to hope that there are more to come.

Shravan Krishnan, a member of the Students Sea Turtle Conservation Netrwork (SSTCN), said it was injured adult turtles with three flippers that normally wash ashore before being treated and released back into the sea. This year, in a reversal of trends, more juvenile turtles with injuries have been coming to the shore and this is a good sign, Shravan said.

The number of dead Olive Ridleys getting washed ashore is also relatively less compared to last year. The situation in 2018 was worse when the season began with a high number of dead turtles washing along the coast in the city, plunging conservationists into gloom.

Principal chief conservator of forests and head of the forest department P Durairasu said that from the 72 nests identified along the Marina and Elliot’s beaches the department had collected 8,141 eggs and placed them in the department’s hatchery in Besant Nagar. Besides, the 24 nests in Pulicat on the Tamil Nadu-Andhra Pradesh border had disgorged 2,738 eggs. Pulicat is one of the hotspots where turtles have been able to lay eggs without human disturbance, he said.

Forest officials and volunteers will soon get busy as the number of nesting turtles coming to shore slowly increases. The turtles will lay eggs that will take between 45 days and 60 days to hatch and the hatchlings will be released into the sea, Durairasu said. Anti-poaching watchers of the department and SSTCN volunteers have divided the walking time among themselves, ensuring that the entire coastline of the city is covered, Durairasu said. While the SSTCN volunteers walk between 11pm and 2am, the anti-poaching watchers walk between 3am and 6am, he said.

However, the authorities concerned have a big role to play in implementing the rules, say conservationists, adding that trawlers, whose nets pose the biggest threat to Olive Ridleys, should not be allowed to fish within five nautical miles of the shoreline. The fisheries department needs to be vigilant and should penalise anyone found violating this rule, they added.

“If this is strictly monitored the turtles can safely come and lay the eggs in the shore,” said one activist.

The turtles mate in November while females begin coming to the shore to lay eggs in January, heralding the start of the nesting season.

282,['9/02/2020'],Rivals exchange blows over CAA at Kolkata book fair,"This story is from February 9, 2020

KOLKATA: A scuffle broke out between anti-citizenship law protesters and BJP supporters at the Kolkata book fair on Saturday after a senior functionary from the saffron party visited a stall there.

The two sides exchanged blows after West Bengal BJP member Rahul Sinha entered the stall early in the evening. A group of Left-backed students surrounded Sinha when he visited the counter, and raised slogans against the CAA and NRC. Police confirmed the incident and said a number of protesters were detained. BJP supporters claimed one of them suffered injuries in the tussle.

The clashes apart, the CAA-NRC episode has had a positive effect as well, with books themed on the topic selling like hot cakes at the fair and in stores. Niche publications that print books on current affairs and little magazines that usually struggle to survive are making the most of the spike in interest about the CAA, NRC and NPR , fuelled by the ongoing nationwide protests.

Nearly all the publications have come out with is sues focusing on these topics in December and January and these are flying off the shelves at the fair and at stores across Bengal’s capital.

Almost all these books are paperbacks and priced between Rs 15 and Rs 50. An obvious example is ‘The Saga of Assam ’s National Register of Citizens (NRC)’, a book that had been gathering dust on a shelf at Parchment Books in Kalighat for months, but saw all its five copies getting sold within 48 hours of the passage of CAA.

The seller called the publisher to order more, only to learn that no more copies were available. The scenes are similar at various other book stores across the city.

Bookstore owners said that besides their regular customers, mostly students and researchers are buying these books.

283,['9/02/2020'],"HC calls for poromboke land survey, encroachment details","This story is from February 9, 2020

Chennai: Madras high court has called for details of poromboke lands available district-wise, and directed officials to furnish the extent of encroachments and explain action taken against government law officers and other officials who fail to properly defend and protect public properties. They shall also explain the proceedings pending before various courts to retrieve the public lands.

A direction to this effect was issued by a division bench of Justice N Kirubakaran and Justice Pongiappan, while hearing a writ petition filed by S V Subbiah.

“This court is of the view that this case is only the tip of the iceberg. There are many government properties and poromboke lands being knocked away by private parties and land grabbers by using political influence, money power, muscle power and in collusion with government officials. The value of the lands has now gone up and therefore, the lands have to be preserved for public purposes. Otherwise, the land grabbers will swallow the properties and unjustly enrich themselves.”

Petitioner Subbiah sought a direction to the Bar Council of Tamil Nadu and Puducherry to expeditiously complete inquiry against K Damodaran. The government advocate failed to file the written submissions despite several adjournments in a case where one TP Ramaraj tried to put up a construction in the natham land at Marchanayakkanpalayam village near Anaimalai in Pollachi taluk.

After Ramaraj’s construction on the natham land was prohibited by the sub-collector in January 2018, he filed a suit before the district court, making only government officials as defendants in the suit and seeking a decree declaring that he is the absolute owner of the suit property.

The bench pointed out that inspite of many opportunities given to the official respondents from March 14, 2018 to September 24, 2019, no written statement was filed and therefore, the official respondents were set ex-parte in the suit. After several adjournments, trial court posted the case for judgment on February 10.

The bench said it would not go into the title of the property, but observed that the government pleader's conduct in the case was suspicious. “It seems that he colluded with the plaintiff as a result of which written statement has not been filed,” it said.

HYDERABAD: BJP councillors from Tukkuguda municipality on Saturday approached the Telangana high court and have urged it to declare as invalid, the vote filed by TRS Rajya Sabha member K Keshava Rao in his capacity as ex-officio member in the election conducted to the posts of chairman and vice chairman of the municipality.

“Keshava Rao was elected as a Rajya Sabha member in 2014 prior to the formation of Telangana and authorities had declared that he was elected under AP quota,” the BJP councillors said.

The BJP workers contended that TRS had used his vote during the Tukkuguda municipal chairman election in an unlawful manner only to ensure the victory of its candidates and had, in the process, thwarted chances of candidates from the saffron party which had won more seats in the municipality.

“Our appeals and representations to election officials have fallen on deaf ears. Even the distrcit collector did not intervene,” said M Raju, one of the petitioners said adding: “The officials are working under pressure from TRS regime. Our representation to the state municipal administration secretary too did not yield any result.”

The petitioners said that the saffron party had complained to governor Tamilisai Soundararajan and the central authorities about the alleged unilateral attitude of the election authorities and sought action against them.

285,['9/02/2020'],Centre is in denial mode about the state of economy: P Chidambaram,"This story is from February 9, 2020

Former Union finance minister P Chidambaram

HYDERABAD: Coming down heavily on the Narendra Modi-led government in the Centre, former Union finance minister P Chidambaram on Saturday said that it is living in a state of denial about the economy , which is like a patient that needs to be admitted into the ICU but is languishing because the doctors are refusing to diagnose the condition.

Delivering a talk on the Union Budget 2020-21 at the Muffakham Jah College of Engineering and Technology here, he said the government would do well to seek advice from former PM Manmohan Singh on getting the economy back on the rails.

“When Manmohan Singh took over as FM, he plainly admitted to the Parliament that the economy was not doing well. He was brave to admit the fact despite him having practically no support in the Cabinet,” Chidambaram said, adding that growth rates have been falling for six successive quarters now and may decline further or remain flat in the next quarter as well.

Chidambaram said the economy is facing two problems. Firstly, people are not spending either because they have no money or are unwilling to loosen their purse strings. Secondly, corporates have hit the pause button on investments despite being cash surplus due to lack of demand, resulting in existing capacities lying idle.

“Manufacturing sector is operating at 70% of capacity and even power units are operating at 55% plant load factor, which means 45% of power plant capacities are lying idle,” he added.

The former minister also accused the Centre of indulging in ‘ tax terrorism’ which led to a successful entrepreneur like Café Coffee Day founder V G Siddhartha committing suicide. “Even the lowest rung officer in the IT department can summon anyone,” he said.

According to Chidambaram, the new I-T rules have complicated the tax structure and do not incentivise savings, which can impact household savings. He also said he was “deeply suspicious” about the government’s motives on LIC as there was no clarity on whether it wanted to list it or divest stake. He added the Budget was not only anti-poor and anti-farmer, it had not provided a roadmap for revival of MSMEs, that have been reeling under the impacts of demonetisation and GST.

Nagpur: 24-year-old Ankita Pisudde , who was set on fire by a stalker on February 3, is on ventilator since Friday evening as her health took a turn for the worse. The accused, Vikesh Nagrale, is now in magisterial custody.

The Orange City Hospital and Research Institute (OCHRI) in city where the lecturer is undergoing treatment for 40% burn injuries declared Ankita’s health status as ‘critical’. A medical bulletin released by the hospital stated that she had respiratory distress and fluctuations in blood pressure.

“She had to be put on ventilator support as her oxygen levels in the blood significantly reduced in view of inhalation injury in lungs. Ankita has been ventilated with 80% oxygen whereas normally 21% is required. She is also on high antibiotics,” the hospital said.

Pisudde, who was working as a contributory lecturer in Hinganghat (Wardha district), was targeted by Nagrale after she complained to her father about the harassment three months ago.

Nagrale, a married man with a child, was nabbed by MIDC Bori police of Nagpur Rural and handed over to their Hinganghat counterparts on the day of the assault. The Hinganghat JMFC court on Saturday sent Nagrale to magisterial custody till February 20.

The accused was in police custody till Saturday. Police have informed the court that they will utilize the remaining nine days of custody at a later date. Nagrale was sent to Wardha jail under tight security from Hinganghat court.

After producing him on February 4, the police interrogated Nagrale till Saturday. He has been slapped with charges for attempt to murder under section 307 of Indian penal code (IPC) and also for setting Ankita on fire under 326A IPC.

Even as prayers are being offered in Ankita’s village Daroda, three men tonsured their heads in Hinganghat for her recovery.

Home minister Anil Deshmukh and city police chief BK Upadhyay visited the private hospital for the second time on Friday to inquire about Ankita’s health. They also looked into the support being provided to her family members.

Along with the family, an officer of the Hinganghat police station and a revenue official have been stationed in the city for any emergency.

PANAJI: Archbishop of Goa Filipe Neri Ferrao, on behalf of the Catholic community in Goa, released a strongly-worded statement on Saturday appealing to the Centre to “immediately and unconditionally revoke the Citizenship Amendment Act and desist from implementing the National Register of Citizens and the National Population Register”.

“The very fact that the CAA uses religion goes against the secular fabric of the country,” he said, adding that CAA, NRC and NPR are causing “great concern and anguish” to millions of Indians spread throughout the world.

The archbishop further added that the NRC and the NPR exercises would result in “a direct victimisation” of the underprivileged classes, “particularly the Dalits, adivasis, migrant labourers, nomadic communities and the countless undocumented people who, after having been recognised as worthy citizens and voters for more than 70 years in this great nation, will suddenly run the risk of becoming stateless and candidates for detention camps in their teeming millions”.

Tirupati: A 60-year-old woman got into a scuffle with vigilance and security guards of Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams at Lord Venkateswara temple at Tirumala in the early hours on Saturday.

According to TTD sources, the woman entered the temple via the Sarvadarshan queue early in the morning. After she entered the sanctum sanctorum, she began hurling abuse at the Srivari sevaks and other devotees.

Realising that the woman might have a mental disability, pilgrim volunteers escorted her outside. After the Srivari sevaks took the woman outside the ‘Vendi Vakili’ — silver gated entrance — a female security guard then tried to escort the woman outside the Tirumala temple but the 60-year-old woman physically attacked the guard. The female security guard retaliated and allegedly slapped the 60-year-old woman.

A group of vigilance and security guards along with other TTD staff came to the rescue and overpowered the woman and took her outside the temple premises.

It was learnt that senior TTD officials have ordered an internal inquiry into the incident and CCTV footage were checked to verify the sequence of events.

TTD sources said the identity of the woman could not be established as she entered the temple through the Sarvadarshan queue.

297,['9/02/2020'],Boycott census if it’s not done on caste basis: Patole,"This story is from February 9, 2020

Yavatmal: Maharashtra assembly speaker Nana Patole on Friday gave a call to boycott the national census to be launched in 2021 if it is not done on the basis of castes. In January, Patole had moved a suo motu resolution in the assembly asking the Centre to include Other Backward Classes (OBC) column in the census. The resolution was passed unanimously.

The caste numbers were last collected under the British in 1931. At the special session of the assembly in January, Patole had said that including the column would help in finding the correct population of the OBCs in the state.

Addressing a public felicitation organized in Yavatmal on Friday, Patole stated that as the assembly speaker he is in the role of a court judge and advises the government on ensuring justice to all sections of society.

Urging people to fight against injustice, the Congress MLA from Sakoli said that though the Constitution has guaranteed equality to all citizens, it hasn’t been achieved so far.

Patole, who had resigned as BJP MP over issues of farmers before joining the Congress, said that his resolve is to fight for genuine cause of farmers. “In 2018, a debt-ridden farmer from Titvi village in Ghatanji tehsil had committed suicide after writing the name of Prime Minister Narendra Modi on a leaf. I visited the bereaved family to console them.

“For me, the chair is not for meeting personal goals but for ensuring justice for the oppressed and needy,” Patole said adding that he has written to the PM in this regard and if needed he would meet him in this regard.

Organizer of the felicitation function Devanand Pawar highlighted contributions of Patole and expressed concern over the irrigation backlog of the region. “Not even 25% of the targeted water is being supplied to farmers from Tapi and Godavari irrigation projects,” he said.

Well-known scholar AH Salunke lauded Patole’s move to resign from BJP over problems of common man.

Later, Patole also chaired a review meeting where he instructed the district administration to mobilize men and machinery to take government’s schemes to the people to solve their problems.

Prominent among those who attended the felicitation function included ex MLAs Vijaya Dhote and Waman Kassawar, Javed Ansari, Vasant Guikhedkar, Dr Dilip Mahale, Nana Gadbaile, Milind Dhurve Chandu Chaudhari and others.

298,['9/02/2020'],‘Puducherry makes a good start for heritage tag certification’,"This story is from February 9, 2020

PUDUCHERRY: Unesco director (New Delhi) Eric Falt said any government ambitious of getting ' heritage city' certification from the international organization must bring together the civil society and private agencies and work in tandem to achieve the goal.

He was here on Saturday to participate in a one-day conference on 'Road to Unesco nomination' organized by the Puducherry town and country planning department and Puducherry planning authority in association with the Indian national trust for art and cultural heritage (Intach), Puducherry chapter.

""It is important to bring together civil society. The government, of course, must lead. The civil society must be fully supported. It is also important to involve the private sector. It will take some time. We made all aware of the challenges ahead,"" Falt told reporters after the conference.

""I am here to give a few suggestions as we do in other parts of the country for anybody who is interested in the nomination process. We wish you well. You are to a good start, but it will take time,"" he said.

Chief secretary Ashwani Kumar said the government will commence the process of creating an inventory that will be projected for the 'heritage site' certifications from the international agency.

""It is a technical work. It must be researched and fine-tuned. There are a lot of challenges within the country. We must borrow ideas from the already successful heritage sites like Ahmedabad and Jaipur. The template is available, and we have to modify it based on our unique selling points and create our own template,"" Kumar said.

He said the town and country planning department will prepare a dossier, take all stakeholders on board, hold discussions at various levels and fine-tune the proposal before presenting it to the government.

Secretary (town and country planning) K Mahesh also underscored the importance of the involvement of the local community in achieving the goal.

""The involvement of the local community is the key to the success of the project. It started in Ahmedabad in 1998. Another important issue is we may be certified as the world heritage site but to sustain and maintain the certification will certainly be a very big challenge without the community’s support. The purpose of this conference is to involve all the stakeholders and experts in achieving our goal,” Mahesh said.

Earlier addressing the conference Falt outlined the guidelines for nomination under the world heritage city. FRAS architect Rabindra Vasavada enlightened the audience on how Ahmedabad was nominated as the first Unesco world heritage city in India.

CEPT University professor (planning) Saswat Bandyopadhyay gave an insight on the heritage-based city development programme in India while Intach co-convenor Ashok Panda and architect A Arul listed out the trust's efforts towards heritage preservation in Puducherry and IIT Madras associate professor (civil) Arun Menon spoke on 'retrofitting' of heritage buildings.

Vijayawada: Senior TDP leader and former finance minister Yanamala Ramakrishnudu on Saturday said the state government’s decision to discontinue white ration cards and pensions would affect eligible beneficiaries.

In a statement, the former minister said the government is neglecting the welfare of the people, particularly the poor. In the eight months since coming to power, the government had avoided the payment of Rs 20,872 crore to the people, he said.

He alleged that the government discontinued 19 lakh white ration cards and seven lakh pensions for 26 lakh eligible beneficiaries.

The former minister found fault with the government for closing Anna canteens and distributing benefits to people for festivals and said the government was diverting SC, ST sub-plan for various welfare schemes instead.

Ramakrishnudu said the spirit of development and self-sustainability that marked the state after bifurcation in 2014 had been undone due to the reverse policies of the government.

The former minister said the government was borrowing to fulfil its electoral promises and had borrowed over Rs 40,000 crore in the last eight months and is set to borrow another Rs 20,000 crore.

301,['9/02/2020'],Tamil Nadu: Tankers continue to dump sewage into Cooum river,"This story is from February 9, 2020

Sewage dumped on the banks of the river Cooum in Maduravoyal.

CHENNAI: Sewage collected from Ambattur, Vanagaram and Adayalampattu areas in trucks and discharged into Cooum river through stormwater drains is a common sight near Maduravoyal flyover. Such a violation is draining efforts of river restoration work by the government.

An official from Chennai River Restoration Trust (CRRT) said they regularly receive complaints from residents who send photographs of trucks dumping untreated sewage into the stormwater drain network and causeways. The CRRT had identified causeways, Tiruverkadu, Adayalampattu and Maduravoyal where sewage was being let out. Metrowater had planned a mini treatment plant on the banks of the Cooum near Maduravoyal flyover. However, this idea was changed and now the location of the treatment plant has been shifted elsewhere, said the official.

A Metrowater official said to check release of sewage by trucks, closed circuit television cameras (CCTV) were fixed at strategic locations. Monitoring of the CCTV camera footage was entrusted to local civic authorities. Soon after the cameras were installed the monitoring was done properly, but slowly it stopped. Now, there is no one to stop or check these violations, the official said.

Another official said Metrowater is yet to start work on Illam Thorum Inaippu, the scheme that will provide sewage connections to households in extended areas . Once this work is completed the sewage from these areas will be collected and sent to the nearby treatment plant. “At present residents in these areas are dependent on the tankers to collect sewage from the chambers built in the houses. If the tankers are not there then it will become a major issue,” the official said.

A Metrowater official said the sewage tankers are operated by political party cadres. Once the underground sewage system is launched in these areas, then automatically the tanker lorry operations will be stopped. “Till then the local body authorities and police have to keep a vigil on the movement of these tankers. They have to seize vehicles that are found to release untreated sewage into the storm water drains or causeways. Only active monitoring by these two agencies will help in reducing this menace,” he said.

Nagpur: A case of cheating and criminal breach of trust was registered by Beltarodi police station after a builder, his partner and another person were allegedly duped to the tune of around Rs50 lakh in a land deal. The case is being probed by the Economic Offences Wing (EOW) of the crime branch.

The case was registered on February 6 but the accused, identified as Shibhu John Mathew, is yet to be arrested.

Mathew, instead of transferring the land, allegedly transferred the ownership to his wife and gave the rest of land to his two sons through gift deeds. It’s learnt Mathew’s wife runs an English coaching class at Hindustan Colony.

It’s learnt that builder Prashant Jhulkantiwar and his partner Dilip Hirani had entered into an agreement to sale with Mathew for a 10,000 sq feet plot at Shankarpur on Beltarodi road in 2006. The duo had paid Rs16 lakh to Mathew as an advance.

The district administration allotted the non-agricultural status to the land in 2007 and also sanctioned a layout there. Later, Jhulkantiwar and Hirani took possession of some plots from Mathew.

The deal was cancelled after the administration reversed its earlier decision. In the meantime, Mathew entered into a similar deal with one Girish Gundawar. Mathew was supposed to sale 30,000 sq feet land to Gundawar for Rs87 lakh. Gundawar had paid Rs34 lakh. After the administration decision, Gundawar too started demanding refund.

Their dispute was earlier was referred to Beltarodi police station when Mathew had lodged a complaint against Jhulkantiwar and Hirani.

An officer of the EOW said that evidence is being collected against the accused and they are also trying to ascertain whether others are involved too.

304,['9/02/2020'],A walk down cradles of West Bengal Renaissance,"This story is from February 9, 2020

Participants at the houses of Iswar Chandra Vidyasagar

KOLKATA: On an overcast Saturday morning, a motley group walked down a 3km stretch to retrace a movement two-and-a-half centuries ago that had reshaped the fate of women, not just in Kolkata or Bengal, but the whole of India.

The Twins Tour (named after twins Arijit and Surajit Dutta), organised in collaboration with Incredible India and ICCR, delved into Bengal Renaissance — a social, cultural, intellectual and artistic movement from the 19th century to the early 20th century that had questioned existing orthodoxies, particularly with respect to women, marriage, the dowry system, the caste system and religion.

The tour began from Amherst Street at the house of Raja Rammohan Roy , considered the father of modern Indian renaissance.

“The property was bought by Roy from Frenchman Francis Mendes for Rs 13,000 around 1815. Its called the Simla House as the neighbourhood is known as Simla. He was the ‘morning star’ of Indian renaissance,” pointed out walk curator Indradeep Narayan Banerjee.

The next stop was around 100 metres down the road at the residence of Iswar Chandra Vidyasagar. After Roy had stopped Sati, Vidyasagar took the next crucial step by promoting widow remarriage. In fact, he was instrumental in arranging the first widow remarriage. Vidyasagar, who was then in Sanskrit College, convinced his friend Ramdhan Takabagish to allow his son Srischandra Vidyaratna Bhattacharya, who was assistant secretary of Sanskrit College at the time, to marry 10-year-old Kalimati, daughter of Brahmanda Mukherjee and Lachmani Devi. This wedding took place on Sunday, December 7, 1856, at 12 Sukeas Street, now 48 Kailash Bose Street, again a short walk from Vidyasagar’s residence. This was the third stop of the tour, the house that once belonged Rajkrishna Banerjee .

Next, the group went to Naba Bidhan, the Brahmo Sabha temple that Keshub Chandra Sen had set up after breaking away from the Brahmo Samaj. Sen was instrumental in setting up Albert College, where the College Street Coffee House is now located. He also started the Victoria School for women that was subsequently relocated to his residence on AJC Bose Road and is now known as Victoria Institution.

“Time permitting, I would have liked to take the group to Bethune School and Balika Brahmo Girls School that had promoted girls’ education. Though Hindu College and Sanskrit College were also a product of Bengal renaissance, they initially welcomed only male students,” Banerjee said.

The protest was held at the seminary campus on Friday, prompting Nomani to issue a clarification and disassociate himself from the remark. “I reached out to the agitating students and cleared the confusion over my remark. The issue was resolved,” he said.

It all started when a video of the VC speaking at local peace committee meeting went viral on Friday. In the video clip, he could be heard purportedly urging the women protesting at Eidgah ground to end the protest in wake of the Centre’s clarification on NRC . “I never issued such a statement.

306,['9/02/2020'],Dwindling catch spurs westward migration of north AP fishermen,"This story is from February 9, 2020

Srikakulam: To reach the shores of the Bay of Bengal, B Laxman must walk only half-a-kilometre from his single-storey house in D Matchylesam village in Srikakulam district. Yet the sea has little to offer the fisherman who migrates with his neighbours to Gujarat every year and spends eight months in a mechanised boat on the Arabian Sea. Migration is mandatory if he is to earn a livelihood.

In 1993, when NT Rama Rao was chief minister of undivided Andhra Pradesh, the government had announced the construction of jetties along the 197-km-long coastline in Srikakulam district. Time passed, the government changed and the state was bifurcated, but the jetties remained only on paper.

For the 35,000-odd fishermen in the region, venturing out to sea on a mechanised boat from the shore along their village remained a dream. Over the years, Laxman and other fishermen learnt how to manouevre mechanised boats and migrated to Gujarat, where their skills were in demand.

“Owing to a lack of jetties here, we can venture out only on small boats and these small boats cannot be beyond a distance of five km from the coast. Fish population within a five km stretch is low due to overfishing and waste from factories. We are left with no other option but to migrate to states such as Gujarat, and even Kerala, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu to earn our livelihood,” Laxman said.

The 18401/18402 Puri-Okha Express reaches Srikakulam Road Station every Sunday at 2.40 pm and departs at 2.42 pm. Every September, Laxman and fishermen from the 104 coastal villages in the district board the train to reach Rajkot. From there, another train takes them to Porbandar, the nearest railway station to the port town of Veraval in western Gujarat.

“We have our dedicated ‘sethji’ (employers who own mechanised boats) who appoint us on a monthly basis. The salary is lucrative. If the catch is good and the ‘sethji’ is impressed, we get tips in the form of cash, cellphones and jewellery,” said C Appa Rao, another fisherman.

A new migrant from the region is first appointed as a cook for seven to eight fishermen, before progressing to the status of ‘khalasi’, sorting and segregating the catch of the day. Within a few years, he learns how to steer the boat and is appointed as an assistant helmsman, and finally a full-time helmsman.

While a cook and a ‘khalasi’ earn between Rs 10,000 to Rs 12,000 a month, an assistant helmsman earns Rs 14,000 to Rs 15,000. The ‘tandal’ or primary helmsman earns between Rs 22,000 to Rs 25,000.

“Although a monthly salary is fixed for us we accept the full payment only after eight months. In between, if ‘sethji’ is happy with the catch he offers us tips. Often he directly sends the tips to my family during Sankranti. Gujarat, especially Veraval port, is a golden duck for us,” said G Rama Rao, another fisherman.

The history of fishermen’s migration from Srikakulam district goes back to 1982, when G Suryanaranaya, a fisherman from Garamandal Mogdalparu village, went to Gujarat for the first time.

Chintapalli Suryanarayana, an advocate and fisheries activist, recollects how his relative from the same village and employed with the Railways was in Gujarat at the time. He informed Suryanarayana about the prospect of fishing in Gujarat and introduced him to a boat owner at Veraval port.

“He was employed and returned with a handsome salary after a few months. The next year, he took along some other fishermen to Gujarat with him. Over the years it became a trend,” added Chintapalli, who also belongs to a fisherman family.

Migration, however, has brought with it its own set of problems. The hunt for a good catch often takes fishermen as far south as the coast of Karnataka and Kerala. Venturing into the sea adjacent to these states requires care, as “the local fishermen don’t allow us to dock our boats on show, and if they do, they take away our catch. We are in trouble if we run out of fuel or develop a technical snag,” said K Raju.

But it is the area north-west of Okha, known as Pak Jalasandhi among local fishermen, that is especially problematic. The territory of Pakistan begins barely 450 km north-west of Okha and “at night when we anchor our boats, we have to be very careful. The boat may drift to Pakistani territory in case of inclement weather. We need to calculate where we drop anchor. Normally, I don’t venture north of Dwaraka after sunset,” said Laxman, who has been helmsman for over 15 years.

Closer home, activists said constructing jetties is not enough, but fishermen need mechanised boats and the money to purchase them.

“The only solution to this is to implement the deep sea fishing policy in Andhra Pradesh. Under this scheme, fishermen would get 50 per cent subsidy to buy mechanised boats,” said Arjilli Dasu, executive director of Fisherfolk Foundation, a community-based organisation for fishermen in Andhra Pradesh.

While the foundation stone for a jetty was recently laid in Srikakulam district, the chief minister has promised to construct more jetties. A draft deep sea fishing policy is ready and needs approval before coming into effect. “It might take some more months or years now,” added Dasu.

Till that time, Laxman and other fishermen from north Andhra have only one road — the Puri-Okha Express from Srikakulam Road Station to Rajkot, and then onwards to Veraval.

They will be trained by experts outside the state and will take a year before being inducted. The trainers here too need to get acquainted with them,” said an IPS officer.The main reason, claimed sources, to introduce this breed is that they can withstand harsh weather conditions. “Just like our previous decision to start a swimming pool for dogs, this induction too has to do a lot about dogs getting tired too soon. The Malinois is a very sturdy dog and do not get tired too easily. They can travel long distances under challenging conditions. They are rugged and an intelligent breed of dog. They can be used in Indian conditions whereas labradors and German shepherds get exhausted within minutes,” said the officer.CRPF has already inducted Belgian Malinois dogs. The Maharashtra police have also written to the home department and the DGP to procure Belgian Malinois for Naxal-hit areas and for Force One, their elite team that deals with terror activities.The city police dog squad, which is attached to the detective department, comprises 35 dogs of different breeds — labrador, doberman, German shepherd, golden retriever, rottweiler and a beagle. Each dog specialises in one of the five policing categories: narcotics tracking, explosives tracking, crime tracking, search and rescue and guard and assault.",kolkata,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74038459,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-149555,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/cops-to-induct-dog-breed-that-tracked-bin-laden/articleshow/74034959.cms
309,['9/02/2020'],Midday meals vendor was already under radar for poor quality,"This story is from February 9, 2020

Nagpur: The food vendor, a local self help group (SHG), which had prepared the midday meals at a Hudkeshwar school where over 30 kids suffered food poisoning, was already under the radar of authorities regarding quality of food.

Shagun Women’s SHG had apparently been chided by the zilla parishad’s education department after its flying squad last month noted that it’s kitchen facility and quality of food were not up to the mark.

Chintaman Vanjari, district’s education officer (primary) said, “A small team had conducted a surprise check on their facilities and the report was not satisfactory.”

He had promised to provide specific details about it to TOI later, as the information was not readily available. Multiple calls to Vanjari later in the evening went unanswered.

Another officer in zilla parishad, under whom the midday meals section too comes, confirmed to TOI that an adverse report about the SHG had been sent and a show-cause notice issued. The ZP team then informed the Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) as they were the nodal agency for tender contract.

NMC’s education officer Priti Mishrikotkar admitted that the state’s education department had submitted adverse report against two SHG over quality of mid-day meal served by them. “The education department has served show-cause notice a couple of days ago. I am unable to provide further information as no one will be in office due to it being a Saturday,” said Mishrikotkar.

Additional municipal commissioner Ram Joshi said the NMC has sought report of khichdi from Food and Drugs Administration (FDA). “If the report comes adverse, we will definitely cancel the tender of the particular SHG,” he said.

To a query, Joshi said that last month the NMC had scrapped tenders of two SHGs supplying mid-day meal following adverse reports against them. “Later, they challenged the NMC’s decision in the high court and brought stay,” he said.

Education activist Shahid Sharif said a police complaint has been filed against SHG Shagun for ‘negligence’. “It is a matter of serious concern that a SHG which is already under the scanner for poor quality of food, is allowed to operate freely,” said Sharif.

Some more residents have received conveyance deeds since then and over two lakh residents have registered themselves on the Delhi Development Authority’s web portal While most people living in these colonies said that PM-UDAY is likely to benefit them, they added that it didn’t influence their voting choices.Bakul Chaudhary (32), a resident of Vashisht Enclave, an unauthorised colony in Burari assembly constituency, said that many people would now be willing to buy property in the area. “Voting for this assembly election, however, will be on other issues.

311,['9/02/2020'],Kolkata: Civic body takes tax arrears burden off new flat buyers,"The new rule will ensure promoters complete a project with all amenities before handing it over to buyers.

TimesView This move will give some relief to property buyers. The KMC should ensure there is no loophole that unscrupulous sellers can use to their advantage.

KOLKATA: Kolkata Municipal Corporation (KMC) will adopt a two-pronged strategy to deal with a section of real estate developers who flout civic rules that ultimately land flat-owners in trouble. First, all tax arrears have to be paid by the builder and not the buyer and second, a buyer cannot be handed possession until the KMC issues a clearance certificate (CC) to the developer.Mayor Firhad Hakim on Saturday asked senior officials in the KMC assessment department to ensure that under no circumstances should an apartment owner be forced to pay property tax that has not been paid prior to registration of the flat. Instead, the land owner or project developer will be held responsible for the outstanding property tax.Hakim was visibly agitated when a senior citizen residing in Behala called him on Saturday and complained of high-handedness by a section of assessment department officials who demanded property tax shown as pending since 2017 while he had received possession of the flat in 2019. Addressing a senior KMC assessment official present in the meeting, Hakim asked why the department had not checked the demand notice carefully before dispatching it to the flat-owner, who did not own the flat then, and hence, could have been a defaulter. Hakim also asked the caller to send an application to his office seeking a remedy.Later, Hakim said officials of the assessment department would be intimated that at the time of issuing outstanding tax notices, they would assess the liabilities of flat-owners vis a vis the land owners or real estate promoters. Hakim also reminded the KMC buildings department officials to ensure that no occupancy certificate was issued from the civic body’s end till a promoter was given a CC by the buildings department.“A section of promoters seek occupancy certificates for selling flats without completing the project. In such cases, the flat buyers, once given possession of flats, find that essential services like water supply or drainage connections are pending. This is gross violation of KMC building rules and under no circumstances we would allow this,” Hakim said.A KMC buildings department official conceded that from now, the civic body would first compel a promoter to apply for a CC and after proper inspection of the site, a proper occupancy certificate would be issued. “If we are satisfied that that the building has been fully complete with all sorts of essential services in place and there is no violation of building rules, we will issue CC to a promoter, following which he can apply for occupancy certificate,” a senior official in the KMC buildings department said.",kolkata,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74041218,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-246187,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/civic-body-takes-tax-arrears-burden-off-new-flat-buyers/articleshow/74034966.cms

315,['9/02/2020'],"Rs 1,800cr to spice up NRG’s pizza, e-vehicle run in India","This story is from February 9, 2020

Nandish Patel

Ahmedabad: Few years ago, a large Indian corporate was looking to forge a joint venture with US-based Little Caesars for setting up pizza outlets across the country.

When the deal did not materialize, the pizza chain, which has for long been looking for an India foray after rivals like Pizza Hut and Domino’s Pizza captured a major chunk of the business here, turned to US-based entrepreneur Nandish Patel.

For Patel, 35, who holds franchise of Little Caesars in the US, it was an opportunity he had been long waiting for – to take his business to India by selling his favourite pizzas.

“It’s like homecoming for me. Back in the US, the idea of running Little Caesars outlets came to me when my father, who is very conservative in his food habits, kept asking for more after he tasted these pizzas,” said Patel, who hails from Dhandhuka and did his schooling from Ahmedabad.

Last month, the Pennsylvania-headquartered Phoenix Nexus, where Patel is the founder CEO, launched Little Caesars in India with the first outlet opening in Ahmedabad.

“We are not in the business of selling pizzas. We are into the business of ‘feeding families’. The Indian food market is huge, and we want to sell best quality pizzas at a very affordable price,” says Patel.

Phoenix Nexus, which bagged the India franchisee for Gujarat and Maharashtra, plans to roll out about 250 outlets within the next five years by employing 5,000 people in these two states before expanding pan-India.

He joined his family business of road construction before moving to the US in 2012.

“I moved to USA for personal reasons. I was harnessing a dream to do something big and did not want to restrict my capabilities as an individual to attempt and achieve, no matter the challenges. I acquired multiple convenience stores, liquor stores in and around Langhorne during the mid-2010s. It was my chance to learn about the market, the consumers and the new territory,” Nandish Patel says.

The annual turnover of the US business, which includes construction and real estate, is soon going to touch USD 100 million (approx. Rs 700 crore), he adds. Phoenix Nexus presently employs over 1,000 people in India and the US.

Patel’s plans for India are not limited to Little Caesars pizza outlets. He is hungry for more!

BIG PLANS

The company is in the process of lining up capital of about Rs 1,800 crore for expansion in the Indian market over the next decade.

“I want to create more than 30,000 direct and indirect jobs in India over the next decade by investing in different business verticals,” he says. Phoenix Nexus is planning business acquisitions both in India and the US.

He foresees potential in businesses of e-mobility, biodegradable corrosion solutions and corporate gifting, among others.

“I am keen to learn and evolve with changing economic landscape. Humans live to eat and eat to live. I will focus on businesses that will make everyone's lives better,” he says.

NEW DELHI: Middle-class voters have always been a key target area for the political parties during any election. This time, too, it wasn’t much different. But all of them weren’t guided by the same issues. While hyper-local issues like better roads and parking dominated some areas, national issues and the country’s safety were more important in a few others.

Many of the voters also admitted that they had switched sides since the last year’s Lok Sabha elections. “My family has long been a BJP supporter but I had voted for AAP last year. This time, all of us are voting for AAP for Delhi’s development,” said Yogesh Kapoor, a resident of Varinder Nagar in west Delhi.

Complete Coverage on Delhi Elections

At Rohini , considered to be a BJP stronghold, there’s a clear divide between AAP’s development and BJP’s patriotic planks. “You can’t ignore that Delhi government has shown that a lot can be achieved with a bit of innovation and positive intent,” said Ramesh Kumar , a Sector 15 resident. His neighbour, Sunil, however, felt sitting BJP MLA Vijender Gupta would increase the margin due to the Modi factor. “We need a fearless leader and not a person who promises freebies.”

Shashank Sharma, a resident of Greater Kailash-I, was also caught between two narratives, but finally decided to go with BJP. “The incidents of violence in December mirrored the lack of security in the capital. Development always comes after national security,” Sharma said. But Amit Malhotra of Defence Colony voted for the candidate who “can bring more development”.

S M Duggal, a senior citizen, said people were clearly divided between the state and the nation. “For the past few years, Delhi has mostly been about freebies and nothing more,” said Duggal, who voted with his wife and son at a government school in Vasant Kunj .

But Navneet Singh of Janakpuri’s C Block was sure that welfare schemes at the state level would be the deciding factor. “A friend had a major accident a month ago and got free treatment at a private hospital. It saved him. There are several other schemes that have been introduced by AAP for the benefit of everyone,” he said.

318,['9/02/2020'],Delhi assembly polls: Muslims vote against ‘divisive’ politics,"This story is from February 9, 2020

NEW DELHI: Safety, peace and development were the three main factors that were considered by Delhi’s Muslims when they came out to vote on Saturday. Several members of the community admitted that they would vote “strategically” to defeat divisive politics, while affirming that Aam Aadmi Party had gained their confidence over the past five years.

In most Muslim-dominated belts in Chandni Chowk , northeast and east Delhi, AAP emerged the clear choice, especially among women who lauded the party for providing electricity, water and healthcare at subsidised rates.

“Over the last five years, there have been noticeable changes in the basic infrastructure in the health and education sector in our area. Our country can be strong only when we have an educated government, whose priorities reflect the aspirations of the common people,” said Farheen, who cast her vote in northeast Delhi’s Seelampur where Chowdhary Mateen Ahmed of Congress is fighting a new AAP candidate, Abdul Rehman . The BJP candidate is Kaushal Mishra.

Some people, however, hinted that Citizenship (Amendment) Act and the communally charged election campaign became reasons for a slight shift towards Congress, which was the only party to take a strong position against the “discriminatory” law.

“We need a strong leader right now, who would not be afraid of becoming our voice. Addressing basic necessities is important, but the fight is for survival right now. We need someone who is not scared of lathis,” said 41-year-old Mohammad Yasin Khan. A divide was visible within the men as well, with those younger than 30 supporting “politics of change”.

At Seemapuri, 24-year-old Faizan, who is preparing for civil services, said his vote “had nothing to do with national issues.” “We may support a prominent national party in Lok Sabha, but in these elections only local issues matter. And only one party has spoken about their plan for Delhi,” he added.

The highly polarised environment was not lost on the candidates either. In Chandni Chowk, AAP’s Parlad Singh Sawhney was contesting against Congress’s Alka Lamba , who had supported the anti-CAA protests at Jama Masjid when she arrived to lend support to Bhim Army chief Chandrashekhar Azad late in December. And some voters said they still remember that image.

At Ballimaran, former environment minister Imran Hussain was against Congress veteran Haroon Yusuf . Despite getting nearly 60% of the votes in 2015, Hussain hoped to race ahead as many in Old Delhi were supportive of Kejriwal.

All five polling stations at Shaheen Bagh , which has been a hub of anti-CAA protests, were declared “critical” by Delhi’s Chief Electoral Officer. As voters lined up for long hours to exercise their franchise, they made their discontent with CAA apparent and said they voted for “development”.

Nida Shaheen, a first-time voter, said, “AAP is doing a lot for improving the quality of education in government schools and healthcare facilities through mohalla clinics. No state government in Delhi ever thought about these issues before.”

At Jamia Nagar, Zubeda Sheikh reiterated Shaheen’s words. She pointed out the poor sanitation condition in the area due to negligence of the municipality, which is governed by BJP. “Our councillor is putting his best efforts, but unless the municipal staff works efficiently one can’t expect the situation to improve,” she added.

Abeeda and her daughter had reached a polling booth in south Delhi’s Malviya Nagar to vote for “peace”. “This was the first time that I was not dictated by my husband or family to cast my vote. I feel strongly for a cause and dragged my daughter along with me. I am against polarisation of votes. I want peace to prevail,” she added.

NEW DELHI: The body of a five-year-old girl , who had been kidnapped from her residence in outer Delhi , was found near a garbage dump in Nihal Vihar. Police said the accused, a juvenile , had been apprehended.

Officers said the juvenile “seemed to be an immature boy who killed the girl in a fit of rage”. Police have not ruled out the possibility of a sexual assault. Postmortem report of the girl is awaited.

At 9.30pm on Friday, police received an information about a girl gone missing from her house. The girl was last seen playing outside her residence. A case of kidnapping was registered. A team of officers searched for the girl through the night but could not find her. On Saturday morning they were informed that the body of the girl had been found at a vacant plot, which was being used as a garbage dump by the local residents.

The girl had been hit by bricks multiple times. Some blood-stained bricks were found by cops. The accused was apprehended on Saturday evening. He told officers that he killed the girl as she would not let him “play games”. “It was a frivolous fight and the minor boy killed her. He said he had slapped her during their earlier fights as well,” an officer involved in the investigation said.

The girl’s father works as a driver and her mother had died a year ago. “I was out at work when I got a call from home asking if I knew where my daughter was or if she was with me. I informed my family that I was at work alone. It was then that we realised that she had gone missing,” the girl’s father said.

“There were brick-hitting marks on the face and skull of the girl,” said A Koan, DCP, Outer.

KOCHI: Kerala has topped the first-ever national e-service delivery assessment ( NeSDA ) by the department of administrative reforms and public grievances with an overall score of 0.83. Goa with 0.74 and Haryana with 0.68 points have been adjudged second and third while Tamil Nadu with 0.13 stood last in the list of 17 states grouped together.Nine northeast and hill states and six Union Territories were considered separately to ensure fairness.The government portals were assessed based on factors like accessibility, content availability, ease of use, information security, privacy and end-service delivery, service delivery, integrated service delivery and status & request tracking.The initial framework of NeSDA based on Online Service Index (OSI) of UNDESA eGovernment Survey was customized to suit the country’s federal structure.The framework covered sectors like finance, education, labour and social welfare (including health and agriculture). Among the central ministries, the portal for health and family welfare topped with overall score of 0.68. Northeast and hill states were topped by Himachal Pradesh while UTs were led by Andaman & Nicobar Islands.“Kerala government’s portal is designed with the citizen in mind and has single sign-in for both the portal and the ancilliary M-Keralam mobile app. Users can avail services, make utility payments and generate transaction certificates without multiple clicks,” said Sabareesh K, head, e-governance. Another interesting feature is tracebilty, which helps citizens track the file movement and integration with e-office. Kerala.gov.in, with content in both Malayalam and English, emerged as the leading state in content availability. But it lost leadership in two key parameters — information security and end service delivery — to Goa and Telengana .“We could not document everything in time. The process of evaluation was itself around four stages with 700 fields in single questionnaire. Out of the 46 mandatory services, we could provide data only for 36,” said Sabareesh. The portal provides more than 60 services spanning nine departments. It is disabled-friendly and has been integrated with services of e-districts. It would be able to provide more than 400 services once government departments begin providing timely APIs that support real time system interaction and data access, officials said.",kochi,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74039171,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-396235,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/kerala-govts-portal-leads-among-states-in-e-service-delivery/articleshow/74035050.cms

Bhopal: A professor of Bhopal’s Barkatullah University, who was heading an investigative project on a potential coronavirus vaccine, has fallen sick during a tour to Kolkata and is said to be in a critical condition.

Ashok Munjal, senior professor heading BU’s department of biochemistry and genetics, and his three-member team were working on the pattern of spread and possible source of infection of the novel coronavirus (nCoV) outbreak in China. “We found that though the bat is a major host for the virus, the role of other wild animals — like Sika deer, green peacock (an indigenous Chinese peacock), and masked palm civet — in spreading the infection can’t be ruled out. We are also investigating how a potential vaccine may be prepared as soon as possible,” said assistant professor Dr Rekha Khandia, who works with Prof Munjal.

“He was already working on the genomics and immunoinformatics part with bat viruses, including Nipah. As soon as it started in Wuhan city, it caught our attention. Zoonotic viruses are our field of work,” she said, calling Munjal an “extremely good HOD, colleague and person”.

Unlike its cousin SARS, nCoV spreads much faster. Prof Munjal’s team studied 45 animals that are reported to be sold in Wuhan’s wet market.

Investigations have shown a possible link between masked palm civet, which was reported to be the host of SARS virus, and the nCoV epidemic. Sika deer, green peafowl and duck-billed platypus were also found to be potential hosts harbouring nCoV, Munjal’s research says.

The virus may have been transmitted from infected animals to humans through aerosols created during slaughter of the animals as well from their nasal and fecal secretions, the study says. “In Wuhan’s wet market, animal are kept in crowded cages and share space with animals of other species as well. Body discharges, like nasal secretions and urine of diseased animals, act as the source for infection to spread to other stressed animals,” says research, pointing out that animals are often slaughtered in front of consumers, opening another channel of infection.

324,['9/02/2020'],Co-op society installs an RO plant for 19 villages,"This story is from February 9, 2020

Madurai: People of Paganeri and other surrounding villages in Sivaganga are a lucky few who have had access to potable drinking water for more than two years now, thanks to a reverse osmosis plant installed in the village by the Paganeri Primary Co-operative Credit Society, which went out of the way to help the villagers.

L Devadoss, who is the chairman of the credit society for a second term, said that though credit societies usually deal with agricultural loans, he had been disturbed by the man hours being lost by a villager to bring water from far off places. During drought, many of them were not been able to pay for packaged drinking water, which was sold for more than Rs 20 a pot.

He had approached the then member of parliament Senthil Nathan of the AIADMK for installing an RO plant in the village. With an allocation of Rs7.80 lakh from the MP’s fund, the plant was installed in Paganeri in 2017. While many panchayats and local bodies did the same and then closed their plant due to lack of maintenance, this plant is going to complete three years of service in March.

“For a five rupee coin we get 10 liters of water, which is the cheapest by all means, and this plant is a big boon,” said Marieswari of Paganeri, adding that she spent more than three hours a day for collecting water before the plant was installed.

The coin operated plant has two sections; school children can take two liters of water for just one rupee. In the last financial year, the plant collected a total of Rs 90,000 by dispensing water, and most of the money was used for the maintenance of the plant. “This year we received about Rs 25,000 as collection. Good rain in the last season has resulted in borewells in our area getting recharged,” said Devadoss.

During summer last year and the previous year, they had been drawing about 5,000 liters of water a day. But since January, the consumption is about 700 to 800 liters per day. The demand is expected to go up as the summer advances. People from 19 villages, which come under this credit society, take water from the plant.

“Our society is 65 years old, and this plant is the reason behind me becoming the chairman of the credit society for the second consecutive time,” said Devadoss, adding that it was the only credit society, which had looked beyond the agricultural needs of people and come forward to help them.

BENGALURU: Caught throwing garbage or urinating by the roadside? You can now pay the penalty through your debit or credit card.

With most offenders trying to get away by stating they’re not carrying cash to pay spot fine, Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike ( BBMP ) has decided to allow card payments. On Saturday, it distributed point of sale (POS) machines to all marshals appointed by the agency to crack down on those defacing the city.

BBMP has appointed 228 marshals — while 15 each are deployed at Bellandur and Varthur lakes, the remaining have been tasked with keeping an eye on black spots in their respective areas. Currently, the marshals have been collecting money from those violating solid waste management rules by issuing them physical challans. They collect around Rs 10-15 lakh per month as penalty. In several areas, there have been verbal clashes between violators and marshals as the latter could not establish their credentials when questioned.

“But this will change now as the marshals will not only wear uniforms (green) but also issue challans from the hand-held machines,” BBMP commissioner BH Anil Kumar told STOI. While the penalty for dumping garbage on road is Rs 500, for urinating in public, one has to pay Rs 200.

BBMP on Saturday launched the Sahaaya 2.0 mobile application through which citizens can lodge complaints. The first Sahaaya app was launched in 2016 and received more than 1,000 complaints within one month of its launch. However, later it was dogged by technical glitches. A BBMP official said: The upgraded version of the app is better as a citizen can also register complaints with regard to Bescom, BWSSB, BMRCL, KSPCB and other agencies. “If a complaint is not resolved in a stipulated time, it will be escalated to higher authorities, who will check the complaint based on proof and video. “There is a special feature of geo-tagging. People can track their complaints online from their mobile app,” said Basavaraju S, special commissioner IT and revenue.

Representative image

MADURAI: Three women tourists from Haryana were killed when a speeding private bus hit the van in which they were travelling near Thirumangalam in Madurai district on Saturday morning.

The victims have been identified as N Thayar, 62, H Mohali, 70, and S Rathini Devli, 70. Some of the seriously injured were shifted to the Government Rajaji Hospital.

According to police, around 40 tourists from Haryana had come to Madurai to visit southern Tamil Nadu and took a couple of vans to visit Kanyakumari first.

When the vans crossed Thirumangalam at 4am, the driver of one of the vans stopped the vehicle on the roadside at Nesaneri Junction on the Madurai-Tirunelveli four-way road to attend nature’s call. A private bus from Coimbatore proceeding towards Kalakkad, hit the van from behind at around 4.10am. In the impact, the tourist van toppled, injuring at least 15 passengers in the van. The private bus veered and ran over the centre median before coming to a halt on the opposite road.

On being alerted, a police team from the Thirumangalam Taluk station came to the spot and helped shift the injured to the hospital.

Higher police officials too visited the spot later and conducted an inquiry to improve safety measures at the spot.

The Thirumangalam police have registered a case against the bus driver identified as E Premsingh from Kalakkad in Tirunelveli district and an inquiry was conducted.

Health officials and a police team escort Chengzu to the Madurai airport.

MADURAI: A 30-year-old tourist from China opted to return to his country after health officials in Ramanathapuram asked him to either remain under isolation for monitoring for two weeks or leave India due to the corona outbreak in China.

His visit created a flutter when he arrived in Rameswaram on Saturday morning. In the evening, he was escorted by health officials to the Madurai international airport, from where he flew to Chennai and is expected to fly to China at the earliest. The tourist was identified as Chengzu, 30, of Anhui, 480km from Wuhan, the epicentre of the outbreak.

“He flew to Kolkata on a tourist visa on January 28. After visiting a few places there he came to Rameswaram on Saturday morning,” Ramanathapuram collector K Veera Raghava Rao told TOI.

He checked in at MCM Towers in Rameswaram. On finding that he had come from China, the staff alerted police. “Public health and revenue officials and police immediately went to the hotel. A team of doctors confirmed that he did not have symptoms of nCoV,” the collector said.

Chengzu was annoyed by the inquiries made by government officials and police.

Meanwhile, the health officials pacified the hotel staff, other tourists and local people, saying there is no need to panic as he is not infected.

Health officials faced difficulty in communicating with him as he was not fluent in English. The officials then used an online translator application.

Since he has already been in India for two weeks, the officials gave him an option to be under quarantine for two more weeks or return home. Though he was upset that he could not visit a few more places in Tamil Nadu, he said he preferred to return to China.

He was escorted by a team of health department personnel and a policeman in a separate vehicle from Rameswaram to the Madurai airport at 2 pm, where he was screened before he was flown to Chennai at 6pm.

Thiruvananthapuram: Soon after finance minister TM Thomas Isaac completed his budget speech on Friday, people protested on roads and social media , claiming that he had neglected the capital while allocating funds. A petition was launched by Sabari Somasekharan Nair to finance minister, chief minister and two local MLAs at change.org that earned over 250 signatures within eight hours.

The petition, which begins with words ‘We didn’t get anything’, questions the allocation for development of Trivandrum Airport (Rs 1 lakh) and the plan to develop Thiruvananthapuram as a metro. “Initially, we thought no major project received funding because of the financial crisis. But another city (Kochi) received Rs 6,000 crore. We had a lot of expectations from budget as it was announced before elections. We didn’t get anything,” states the petition.

Friends of Trivandrum, a collective of city residents, staged dharna in front of Secretariat holding begging bowls, seeking aid for city projects.

Trivandrum Indian, a social media page, in a post shared on Saturday said, “In addition to basic facilities, a city requires development projects which can create job opportunities. If the people representatives are not able to seek funds for developments project, why should be they elected for the post.” Another social media page, Trivandrum Rises, stated that the city was neglected in the budget just like Centre neglected Kerala in its budget.

MLA VS Sivakumar said the MLAs from Thiruvananthapuram will take up the matter with Isaac. “While FM declared several packages for other districts, nothing was proposed for the development of capital. Projects proposed in previous budgets are incomplete. We demand projects for Thiruvananthapuram,” he said.

MLA KS Sabarinadhan said there was nothing wrong in giving Rs 6000 crores to Kochi, but budget completely neglected Thiruvananthapuram. Vizhinjam project, declared during UDF regime, is lagging; Light metro has not seen the light of the day, he wrote on Facebook.

BJP too organized a protest march to Secretariat on Saturday and burned chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan, finance minister Thomas Isaac and tourism minister Kadakampally Surendran in effigies.

BJP district president VV Rajesh said the city was left out by FM’s budget. Many of the ongoing and proposed projects such as Karamana-Kaliyikkavila road development, airport development, coastal area package, Attukal township plan, renovation of city road and Attakulangara overbridge and Light metro either received negligible allocation or were forgotten in the budget.

Representatives of Trivandrum Chamber of Commerce and Industries said that Thiruvananthapuram should get its due as the capital. “I raised this issue with FM. The response that projects will be funded through KIIFB is impractical. Thiruvananthapuram is the capital city and should be given its due. People assess a state by development projects in the capital,” said TCCI president S N Raghuchandran Nair.

Virudhunagar: For the first time in the country, work on identifying Aadhaar numbers of deceased people will commence soon as a pilot project in Virudhunagar district, assistant director of the Unique Identification Authority of India (UIADI), Bengaluru, Santhana Gopalan said here on Friday.

Speaking after a meeting on the UIDAI programme, which was presided over by Virudhunagar collector R Kannan, where the functioning of Aadhaar centres in schools were reviewed, he said that Aadhaar cards had become mandatory for all purposes. In the past decade, 128 crore people across India had were distributed the Aadhaar cards. However, till now no steps were taken to gather information on cards belonging to the deceased people. Now, the process of gathering information of such people who had died in the last eight years will be initiated in Virudhunagar district.

Gopalan also said that in Tamil Nadu, children did not have Aadhaar cards as they are linked to the child development scheme and school education department. When the card is obtained for a child below five years biometrics are not recorded. It is mandatory that children who obtain their Aadhaar cards renew them at age five and then again at 15 years, as biometric details including fingerprints are taken then. They would be given a grace period of two years to renew their cards.

In Virudhunagar district, special Aadhaar centres had been established in schools to enable students to get them. Such centres are functioning in 770 schools in the state and in 55 schools in Virudhunagar district. About 75,000 children in Virudhunagar are yet to obtain Aadhaar cards. He also said that about 99.5% of the elders in Tamil Nadu had obtained Aadhaar cards, and there was a need to cover about 28 lakh more.

Gopalan said that a person who needs to change his address can submit any of the 25 documents specified in the UIDAI website. These cards should be obtained only through authorised centres and people should not share copies of their Aadhaar cards with others, he said.

331,['9/02/2020'],National award winning director says his movie is bringing a change in the society,"This story is from February 9, 2020

AURANGABAD: Hellaro , a Gujarati movie that was declared as the best feature film at the 66th National Film Awards , is being screened at the Aurangabad International Film Festival (AIFF) among 39 other national and international movies.

Hellaro director Abhishek Shah said that though the movie is set in 1975, it is very much relevant today and is bringing a change in the society gradually.

During his visit to the festival, Shah spoke to TOI about the conception of the film. “In 2016, I came across an old (woman) friend who is working as a manager in a corporate firm. She had not uploaded even a single picture on her social media account. When I asked her about it, she told me that she was not allowed to post her pictures online. This triggered me to make a movie on the issue,” Shah said.

He said that the sense of proprietorship for another human being cannot be accepted and that is what the film is all about. Set in a rural backdrop, Hellaro portrays a group of women who go against the diktat that restricts them from dancing. “The other reason that led me to make this film was that what is destined will happen... may what come. Just like the movie’s title, Hellaro, which means wave that changes everything, the women end up liberating themselves from the diktat imposed on them,” the 37-year-old said.

The movie released in October 2019 continues to be screened in various theatres in Gujarat. Shah said that he received several texts and calls from many women telling him that Hellaro is based on their story. “Men too feel a connection with the film. After a screening, a 55-year-old man stood up and said that after watching Hellaro, his conduct towards women in his family has changed,” the director said.

The five-day AIFF will see its finale on Sunday. A panel of movie experts have selected a collection of regional, national and international films for the film fest. Film and art students, movie lovers and enthusiasts have planned to watch various movies and attend classes by film makers.

Devotees were seen carrying different kavadis including ‘paravai kavadi’ where they are suspended with iron hooks pierced into their skin from a pole in cranes or other vehicles. Women were seen carrying milk pots on their heads in a grand procession behind the moving car.

Over 3,000 police personnel were deployed on duty for the festival. Close circuit television cameras were also installed in vantage points and the crowds were monitored. Tonsuring of hair were also performed in many places.

The district administration had made all arrangements in coordination with the temple administration to provide basic amenities to the people. Chief executive officer of the temple Jaya Chandra Banu Reddy, assistant commissioner of the temple Senthilkumar among others monitored the festival.

Madurai: Thousands of devotees gathered around the Mariamman Teppakulam on Saturday, when the float of the Sri Meenakshi Sundareswarar Temple was pulled around the brimming tank. The tank was filled with clean water which was brought through its traditional channels from river Vaigai, after nearly 40 years.

The float festival began on January 28 with the flag hoisting and the deities were taken out in a procession on the streets of city, since then. On Saturday, goddess Meenakshi and her consort Lord Sundareswarar were taken out of the temple and around the temple streets at 5.30am.

They were then brought to the grandly decorated float, placed on the pedestal, and taken around the tank twice in the morning.

As per tradition, members of the Devendra Kula Vellalar from Anupanadi village were given the first rights to touch the ropes and initiate the pulling of the float. This tradition has been in vogue for more than 300 years. The ropes were decorated with colourful flowers and people vied with each other to touch them and pull the float around the tank. A large number of foreigners too witnessed the festival.

The central mandapam of the tank was also decorated with colourful lights and it was illuminated in the night when the float was again pulled around the tank.

Two boats under the supervision of the district fire officer, S Kalyan Kumar were also stationed in the tank as a precautionary measure. A large posse of police were deployed on duty.

334,['9/02/2020'],Norms for ward reservation violated: Corporators,"This story is from February 9, 2020

Aurangabad: Some corporators and aspirant candidates have alleged that the civic body has violated several norms laid down by the state election commission (EC) while defining the ward boundaries for the upcoming elections

Until Friday, 97 objections were filed for the ward reservations and ward boundaries.

In a letter to to the Aurangabad Municipal Corporation’s election department, the EC had notified the guidelines and criteria to fix ward boundaries. However, some alleged that the municipal wards have been designed to benefit selected individuals.

According to the details from the draft ward formation report in 2005 civic body election, there were 17 wards reserved for scheduled caste (SC), which was based on the 2001 Census. The draw to pick SC wards was initiated from Ambedkar Nagar ward which had a population of 9,124 with 8,197 SC population comprising 89.7% of the total ward population. The SC ward reservation that started from Ambedkar Nagar ward was ended at Kotwalpura ward which had a population of 8,749 which included 2,028 SC population i.e. 23.20%.

From 2010 onwards, wards were reserved according to the descending order of reservation rotation which means it should have been fixed in the descending order of SC population.

In 2010, Wankhede Nagar was reserved as SC ward with a population of 8,057 which included 2,075 SC population comprising 27% of the total population. In 2010, the SC ward reservation ended at Nyay Nagar ward which had 17.41% SC population.

In 2015, the 2011 Cencus was considered forward formation. Therefore, the SC wards increased from 17 to 22. The SC ward reservation started from Cidco N-1-MIDC Chikalthana, with 43.47% SC population. The SC ward reservation ended at Padegaon ward which had 14.34% SC population.

For 2020, the AMC election ward reservation, based on the descending order of reservation rotation the wards with less than 14.34% SC population should have been reserved for SC first and then based on descending order the other SC wards should have been fixed. However, the AMC election department has again reserved Cidco N-1-MIDC Chikalthana ward as an SC ward which now has an SC population of 21.11%. Surewadi and Indiranagar-Baijipura West wards are also reserved for SC category even though they had a relatively lower SC population than other non-SC wards.

The reservation of Surananagar ward is also under suspicion. In 2005, the ward was reserved for OBC, but was left open for all in 2010 and again was reserved for women (general) in 2015. Now, the ward has again been left open. The ward has not received SC reservation for the 4th successive term. The rule to not cross DP road and state highway has also been violated while defining boundaries of Surananagar ward.

AMC election department head Kamlakar Phad said that the EC will take a decision on the objections filed.

Bhopal: After reports of illegal diamond mining in protected forest area near Panna National Park, forest department conducted raids to curb the shallow –mining of precious stones very close to the buffer zone of the park on Friday.

Equipment used for digging were confiscated while the people involved in mining escaped.

A senior forest official said that after years of shallow mining of diamonds in Panna, the precious stones are hard to find in the mines situated outside the jungle. Most such shallow mines are now located on the private lands and farm fields. “Villagers have now started carrying the mining operations right inside the forest. And this, is not possible without connivance of our staff,” he said.

A large number of diamond mines are operated inside the protected area of the forest in Pahadikheda region where Baghin river flows. There are more illegal diamond shallow mines than the number of legal mines leased out by the administration, forest department sources claimed.

Friday-raids were conducted in the Vishramganj forest circle of North forest division of Panna, said Ajay Bajpayee, the sub-divisional officer (Vishramganj range). He said that diesel pump sets, large number of shovels and spade were confiscated. After a tip-off, a team was constituted which conducted the raids, he said.

Almost on regular basis, villagers mine diamonds from the shallow mines in Panna. Their price varies from few lakh rupees to over a crore rupee. The diamonds are auctioned by the administration every three months and the proceeds are handed over to the miner after deducting the royalty.

It was the typical engineers’ journey for the three graduates of National Institute of Technology (NIT) at Surat — Viswanadh Malladi, Santosh Samala and K Madhav Reddy – when they passed out in 2011 and 2012. They opted for corporate jobs and tried to settle in. But it was not their destiny.

""I used to commute about 30km daily to and fro in Hyderabad. On a regular bike – which forms about 70% of the private vehicle owners in India – a long ride is often uncomfortable,"" recounts Reddy. ""For starters, one has to shift positions often on the seat as butt numbness is quite common. Another idea we thought had some potential was of reducing pollution inhalation for the commuters.""

Reddy, along with his two seniors sat down literally to find that ‘Eureka!’ moment when they decided to address the uncomfortable ride with technology. The team members cited air suspension technology of advanced buses as an example. ""If we reduce the passing of innumerable jerks caused by bad road conditions from vehicle to the rider, it would be possible. Thus, we looked at the options and finally selected the air float tech as a feasible idea,"" said Samala, adding that it was the birth of Feel Good (Fego) Innovations.

The idea was simple to start with – but the execution was not that easy. They used inflatable material where the user can blow air and can strap the inflated pad to the seat. The floating pad with air bubbles adapts to the shape of the rider’s buttocks and evenly distributes air for better suspension.

The team members said that they received Rs 10 lakh each from government of Gujarat and National Institute of Design (NID) as part of initial funding as a design project.

Reddy said NID sanctioned them Rs 25 lakh, but they had already raised Rs 1 crore from other investors in 2017. ""Ours was one of the biggest crowdfunded projects when it was launched. People were hooked to the idea,"" he added.

The brand ‘Fego,’ based in Hyderabad, currently offers two variants of the air float seats for bikes, and air cushion for cars. ""In 2019, we sold about 20,000 units. The number is very encouraging,"" said Reddy.

Malladi said they are working on a product for commuters that can revolutionize long-distance travel. ""Positive feedback by the users on social media sites is the testimony we believe in and that keeps us going,"" he said.

Representative image

MADURAI: The Madurai district food safety department has received 209 complaints over WhatsApp related to bad food and sub-standard edible items in 2019, which is one of highest number registered in the state.

Officials said that of the 32 districts, only four districts, including Madurai, had received WhatsApp complaints crossing the 200 mark. They said that it was result of the kind of awareness measures carried out and publicity taken up by pasting stickers at eateries and hotels. In fact, Chennai had received more than 500 complaints, while Kancheepuram received more than 300 complaints. Sources said that of the 209 complaints received, action was taken against the concerned eateries with 24 hours, while action against 29 eateries was taken between 24 and 48 hours. However, all the complaints have been addressed subsequently. WhatsApp method, which was popularized a couple of years ago by the food safety department, is the most preferred means for raising complaints.

Designated officer for food safety, Madurai district, Dr M Somasundaram said that most complaints were related to food served at hotels and eateries. There were fewer complaints in connection with adulteration or substandard food materials. All the complaints were taken seriously and checked at the earliest by pressing the food safety officer for the area concerned, he said.

Officials lifted 88 samples in 2019 from food business operators dealing with various food products of which 77 were sent to laboratories for testing. Of the 77 samples, 36 were found unsafe and 52 did not confirm to the standards set by the Food Safety and Standards Authorities of India. As on December, 2019, 21 civil cases filed by the food safety department were pending before the RDO court. As many as 62 criminal cases were filed from Madurai district, sources said.

339,['9/02/2020'],Punargeham housing project to take off soon in Kozhikode,"This story is from February 9, 2020

Kozhikode: ‘ Punargeham’ , the housing project of the fisheries department to relocate fishermen families living in the close vicinity of the sea will take off soon in the district. The plan is to construct houses for 210 families in the first phase.

The implementation of the project has been lagging owing to the reluctance of the fishermen families to relocate from their existing homes. However, after much awareness, 210 families have submitted their consent to relocate from the risk prone zones.

The department has received an allocation of Rs 21 crore for the first phase implementation of the project, said an official with the office of the fisheries deputy director. The decision is to spend Rs 10 lakh each for every applicant, said the official.

While the government has decided to allot Rs 6 lakh for purchase of land, the remaining Rs 4 lakh will be used for the construction of house. If it is possible to get land for a lesser price then the excess amount will also be invested for the construction of house.

The fisheries department is introducing the scheme aiming to relocate fishermen and non-fishermen families living in the proximity of the sea to a safer distance in the backdrop of frequent incidents of sea erosion. The unavailability of suitable land for the construction of houses is a major hurdle.

The department is also planning to construct flats on the availability of suitable land. A survey conducted earlier by the fisheries department had identified over 2,609 families living 50m away from the sea.

The plan is to shift the families at least 200m away from the sea as they don’t have to run to safety during every rainy season. The survey was conducted along the 71km stretch of Kozhikode coast from Beypore to Azhiyur aiming to relocate all susceptible families to a safer distance.

According to the survey, over 954 families are living within 10m limit from the sea and are living in high risk areas. “The proximity of houses to the sea increases the worries during cyclones and sea erosion,” said the official with fisheries department.

The fund for the project is allocated from the chief ministers’ Disaster Relief Fund. The officials are expecting positive response from more fishermen families after the completion of the first phase project.

Of the total number of families, only 210 families have expressed their willingness to relocate, said the official adding that the reluctance of the beneficiaries was a major concern.

340,['9/02/2020'],Civic polls: Parties start search for woman candidates,"This story is from February 9, 2020

Aurangabad: With 58 of the 115 wards in the Aurangabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) having been reserved for women, political parties have now launched a hunt for woman candidates.

Based on the quota fixed by the Maharashtra government for local bodies, the state election commission reserved 50% of the seats in the civic body for women. In a 115-seat AMC, 58 seats, therefore, are earmarked for women.

However, despite the reservation, local body politics continues to be dominated by men. As soon as the ward reservation declaration was made on Monday, men aspiring to contest from particular wards started planning to field female members from within their families.

While different parties have different criteria for selection, functionaries said the job of a corporator is not an easy one. This is because a corporator must be ready to face irate residents on a daily basis.

Madhuri Adwant-Deshmukh, the BJP corporator from Cidco N-3, N-4 ward and former women and child welfare committee chairperson, said her party selects the candidates through an interview process and based on the elective merit. “Everyone aspiring to contest on a party ticket gets a chance to appear for the interview with the senior party functionaries. The workers of the BJP Mahila Morcha, who have been working for the past several years, are given preference,” Adwant-Deshmukh said.

When asked if the women corporators have the freedom to work, she said that she herself has been working independently without any interference from any family member. “If the party has placed trust on the women, the family members should give them a free hand too,” she said.

Foreseeing a large number of its seats going to the women’s quota, the MIM had launched its state women’s wing just a week before the ward reservation draws were held. Many of the wards, including the ones of the former leader of opposition Zameer Quadri, former group leader Naser Siddiqui and current group leader Gangadhar Dhage have now been reserved for women. Saira Ajmal Khan, the MIM corporator from Chelipura, said the party is not limited to the Muslim community. “The party is looking for experienced, sincere and able women from all communities to represent the wards. The newly formed women’s wing, under the state president, will be making candidate selections,” Khan said.

Shiv Sena office-bearers, including mayor Nandkumar Ghodele, House leader Vikas Jain and former standing committee chairperson Raju Vaidya have had their wards reserved for women for the April AMC elections . Jain, whose ward is now reserved for women in the open category, expects the party to allow his wife to contest from the ward. “This is my fifth term from the Vedantnagar ward. Based on the party decision, my wife or some other candidate will be contesting from the ward for the Shiv Sena,” Jain said.

HYDERABAD: The Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC), on Saturday, passed a resolution against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), making it the first civic body in the country to take a stand against CAA . The decision was taken at GHMC ’s council meeting held to approve its budget. The move was supported by corporators from AIMIM and TRS.

Speaking about it, Hyderabad mayor, Bonthu Rammohan said: “Chief minister, K Chandrasekhar Rao has opposed the CAA and we want to stand in solidarity with him. That is why we have passed this resolution.” Asked about implementation of the National Population Register (NPR) exercise he added: “After the resolution is passed in assembly, the procedure (for NPR) will be followed as per the mandate.”

Lauding the move, Hyderabad MP, Asaduddin Owaisi later tweeted: “The resolution was adopted after former mayor & @aimim_national corporator Majid Hussein proposed it & it was accepted by @bonthurammohan...I thank all @aimim_national corporators & must also thank @TelanganaCMO for his support.”

Earlier, the meeting took an ugly turn when AIMIM and BJP corporators clashed with each other over CAA. AIMIM corporators said they would not allow officials to enter their wards if they asked for details pertaining to CAA, NPR or NRC. Their comments did not go down well with their BJP counterparts who accused AIMIM of playing politics over CAA and wasting time during the budget session. “This is a budget session, why is CAA being discussed,” asked BJP’s G Shanker Yadav, corporator from Begum Bazar.

TRS too joined the melee with members demanding a resolution against CAA. “It should be rolled back,” said TRS MLC, M S Prabhakar Rao who was backed by GHMC deputy mayor, Baba Fasiuddin. He called CAA unconstitutional.

Thiruvananthapuram: Veteran actor Sreelatha Namboothiri , who moved with her husband to the city 15 years ago after he took up a new job, said that the warmth and love of residents has won her heart and now the Alappuzha native takes pride in being a resident of the capital.

Sreelatha, who turns 70 on Monday, will celebrate her birthday with the inmates of Gandhi Bhavan at Pathanapuram. “I am happy that God has given me a happy and healthy life and I will celebrate my birthday with 1,000 residents of Gandhi Bhavan,” said Sreelatha who will also receive NL Balakrishnan memorial award , instituted by Gandhi Bhavan, on Monday.

Loved by Keralites for her comedy and mother roles, Sreelatha is still busy with classical music concerts, films , serials and even mimicry. From Padicha kallan to the recent film Ambili, she has done roles big and small and it was music that made her a part of the showbiz.

She remembered how KPAC asked her to sing a song in the late 60s. “I was in Class X when I joined it as a singer. The only eligibility I had was that I had won prizes in music at school festivals. Later playwright Thoppil Bhasi made me act in a drama, Koottukudumbam. This paved the way for my acting career,” she said.

Sreelatha became known for her comedy in films. “I was featured with Adoor Bhasi in 90% of my films. One would be surprised to know that I rejected acting with him when I was approached for Viruthan Shankhu. It was the rejection of a teenager who wished to be the heroine of Prem Nazir and Satyan (laughs...). Finally, I found my place in comedy genre with Bhasi chettan as my pair,” she said.

Sreelatha reminisced that there were no young women back then to do comedy films. “Back then, along with the film plot, there will be a separate comedy track mostly written by Sashikumar or Bhasi chettan. After 10-12 film pairings, Bhasi chettan knew that I had rejected a film with him. He told me that comedy is a permanent space for an actor rather than the heroine and comedians can always win the audience with humorous counters,” she said.

Adoor Bhasi was a mentor who inspired her to love and respect oneself. “He was an example of dedication. Even when he was down with high fever or other ailments on film sets, he would play his role with perfection. For him, Nazir the perfect human being. When gossips were published in newspapers about me and him, I was depressed. He said that gossips reflected my popularity and I should be happy that people are noticing me,” she said.

Sreelatha has an unfulfilled dream, “I always wanted to perform some character roles, but I failed to get them,” she said.

343,['9/02/2020'],Centre’s health outlay woefully off course for 2.5% of GDP target,"This story is from February 9, 2020

India will be nowhere near spending the promised 2.5% of GDP on health at the current rate at which budget allocation for health is increasing. The allocation is short by over Rs 55,000 crore going by government’s own projection of what should have been allocated in 2020.

A National Health Mission presentation from 2018, provided a road map for reaching the targeted 2.5% by 2024-25. It calculated that the combined allocation of the centre and states should reach 1.58% of GDP by 2020-21 and 35% of this would have to come from the centre.

By that calculation, the central outlay for 2020-21 ought to have been Rs 1.24 lakh crore. Instead, it is only Rs 69,234 crore or about 56% of what was needed to stay on course.

The health outlay increased by a measly 4.2%, when it needed to go up by 80% to reach the government’s target of Rs 1.24 lakh crore. Similarly, in 2019-20, the calculations show that central allocation for health should have been over Rs 1 lakh crore and that of states Rs 1.86 lakh crore for total public health expenditure to touch 1.4% of GDP.

However, the central allocation of about Rs 66,500 crore fell short by almost Rs 34,000 crore, while the states allocated well over their target (see graphic). Thus, central allocation increased by just 18% in the 2019-20 budget when it had to go up by about 78% to reach the target.

According to RBI ’s study of state budgets, in 2019-20, all states put together allocated Rs 1.97 lakh crore for health, accounting for 75% of the total public expenditure on health. By the government’s projections in the roadmap, states needed to allocate only Rs 1.86 lakh crore.

The pattern was the same in 2018-19 too. States allocated well above their target and accounted for 76% of public health expenditure, while the centre fell short of target and accounted for barely 24% instead of the expected 35%. The roadmap calculated future allocations based on an estimated GDP growth of 7.5% and inflation rate of 4%.

Based on these estimates, the allocation would have to be over Rs 1.5 lakh crore in 2021 22 (next budget) to touch 1.76% of GDP, a more than 100% increase from the current allocation of Rs 69,000 crore, which seems unlikely. Thus the steady increase over the next three years from 1.76% to 1.98% and then 2.22% before reaching 2.5% of GDP by 2024-2025 seems to be averitable pipe dream.

With economic slowdown, there are apprehensions that allocations for sectors like health could fall even further short in the coming years as the government struggles to meet expenditures it cannot cut back on like salaries and pensions. In such a scenario, even maintaining the current level of health spending as a percentage of GDP could prove to be a challenge.

The Comptroller and Auditor General’s report tabled in Parliament last year had also noted that the allocation in 2019-20 was way short of the target of Rs 1 lakh crore allocation for health sector by 2019-20.

Trichy: It was a rare occasion of experience-sharing as candidates of the recently-held local body polls met at an interactive workshop organised by ‘Thannatchi’ (self-governance), a registered society, in Trichy on Saturday.

While the successful candidates elected as panchayat presidents and ward members assured to strive for improving the basic amenities in their villages, the unsuccessful ones were encouraged to support and guide the endeavours of their respective elected representatives.

Around 30 candidates from 10 districts, who contested for the posts of panchayat president and ward members, attended the meeting. Former panchayat presidents who have made their villages a model in self-governance spoke.

Hariprasad Chaurasia

BHOPAL: One of the best known exponents of flute, Padma Vibhushan Pandit Hariprasad Chaurasia , who was in Bhopal for a performance at MANIT on Saturday, said he is happy to see the youngsters today taking more interest in classical music than the previous generations and performing on stage more confidently.

""It's nice to see the youth take deep interest in classical music. Future of classical music is bright as so many youngsters are learning classical music and performing on stage. They discuss ragas, artistes and have a lot of knowledge about music and its nuances. They are far more confident than we were at their age,” he said.

Enthralling the audience with classical ragas, the maestro added, ""Though Western countries are more interested in Indian classical music, the trend is also on the rise in our own country. ""Many youngsters are learning classical music through Internet, due to lack of availability of good teachers. Most of the artistes who teach are busy travelling across the US and Europe for concerts, which deprives new learners of proper guidance. For this, I wish the government comes up with a solution and helps budding classical musicians who want to learn from a good teacher.""

Commenting on artistes who begin with classical music and then switch over to other genres or opt for television shows to get fame, he said, ""That was happening a few years ago, but now students of classical music prefer to make a career in classical music only.

Besides, ups and downs happen everywhere; they are a part of life. Eventually, we all realise that classical music is like Sun. No matter how many artificial lights are invented, nothing can beat the warmth of sunlight. Classical music will never die, no matter how many other kinds of music get popular."" The legendary musician concluded his performance with the bhajan 'Vaishnav Jan'.

351,['9/02/2020'],Probe ordered after convict’s death,"This story is from February 9, 2020

Kannur: DGP (prisons and correctional services) Rishi Raj Singh ordered a probe after Mattannur native NPK Harris was found hanging in the TV room inside the central prison compound on Friday evening. He was serving a life term for the sexual abuse of a minor girl in his family and his involvement in a sex racket. He was awarded life term in July 2008. “DIG (north zone) will conduct an enquiry and submit the report within three days and follow-up measures will be taken accordingly,” said Singh.

Though there were complaints about security measures, including defunct surveillance cameras , prison officials said that the issues were addressed recently. Cameras are in place now. But these are mainly used for inside surveillance and places like TV room are not covered, they added.

In the backdrop of Friday’s suspected suicide, prison officials, including DIG, conducted an internal enquiry and recorded the grievances of some prisoners, especially those in prison in sex abuse cases (including pocso), as there were complaints that such prisoners were often targeted by other prisoners for torture. After studying all complaints, a report would be submitted to the DGP, they said. Incidentally, Singh had visited the prison on the day Harris committed suicide.

Harris’s duty in prison was welfare activities for prisoners. This duty is assigned to inmates who are not troublemakers and hence they are not under much surveillance. This was the reason why nobody may have noticed him and the incident came to light as he failed to turn up in his cell in the evening. Though there is lack of permanent staffers in prison, temporary staff is appointed for work, said officials.

In August 2018, V Soumya, a resident of Pinarayi accused of poisoning her parents and daughter, committed suicide inside the compound of the women’s prison, located next to the central jail. Two officials were suspended in that case. There is complaint that manpower crunch and security deficiencies were not addressed in prisons.

JD(U) MLC from Bihar, Javed Iqbal Ansari, at Rims in Ranchi on Saturday.

PATNA: As Delhi went to vote in the assembly election on Saturday, focus will now shift to Bihar where former minister and ruling JD(U) MLC Javed Iqbal Ansari caused ripples in the state’s political circles after he called on incarcerated RJD chief Lalu Prasad at Ranchi-based hospital and talked in favour of supporting a “new leadership” in the state. Ansari’s term as MLC is to end on May 23 this year.

Ansari also hinted to quit the JD(U) and support the RJD in future. “Nitish Kumar was a good leader. You all better know what he is today. Bihar needs a new leadership,” he said after meeting Lalu on Saturday.

Sources said Ansari, who was a cabinet minister in a previous government led by Nitish Kumar, met Lalu for around half an hour at Rajendra Institute of Medical Science (Rims). “I was born in politics by Lalu Ji. Both Lalu and former CM Rabri Devi always showered their blessings on me. Currently I am a JD(U) MLC. Even while in JD(U), I used to get blessings of Lalu Ji,” Ansari told media.

To a query, Ansari said, “Bihar requires a ‘yuva netritva’ (young leadership).” It is widely beings considered that he was referring to Lalu’s son Tejashwi Prasad Yadav , who is the RJD chief ministerial candidate in the next election.

Ansari was earlier in the RJD. He had won from Banka assembly seat in 1995, February 2005 and 2010 on the RJD ticket. But he rebelled against the RJD leadership in April-May 2015 along with 12 other MLAs to extend support to then CM Nitish Kumar.

Ansari and two other RJD MLAs -- Samrat Choudhary and Ram Lakhan Ram Raman -- officially quit the RJD and assembly membership on May 18, 2014. A few days later, Ansari and Raman were nominated as MLC from the governor’s quota.

Ansari and Raman were prominent among the 13 RJD MLAs who had earlier proposed to the Speaker to recognize them as a separate group in the assembly. But, later, nine out of the 13 MLAs returned to the RJD. The resignation of the three MLAs had then reduced the RJD’s strength in the 243-member Bihar assembly to 21.

Trichy: Even as authorities from the electricity board have started the process of fixing digital meters to the motor pumpsets used for irrigation purpose, delta farmers suspect that the state government may levy charges on the pumpsets received under the tatkal scheme.

The state government had introduced tatkal scheme in 2018, under which free power connections was provided to farmers for cultivation. They had to pay Rs 2.5 lakh for a 5 HP (horsepower) motor, Rs 2.75 lakh for 7.5 HP motor and Rs 3 lakh for 10 HP motor. Ever since the government made the announcement, small and marginal farmers had been opposing it stating that they cannot afford it. Despite the opposition, the scheme was implemented.

Though the power supply is free of cost, Tangedco has begun fixing digital meters with the existing electric motor pumpsets installed in fields across the delta districts. This has created panic among the farmers whether the government would levy any charge for power consumption in the future, state spokesperson of Bharatiya Kisan Sangam, N Veerasekaran said.

“I have been using a pumpset with 7.5 HP motor that I got under the tatkal scheme for the last two years. Without any prior intimation or any circular from the government, technical staff from EB office came here and fixed a meter. When I asked the reason, they said that it was for a monitoring purpose. I paid Rs 3 lakh to get power, why should I be monitored?” asked L K Arumugam, a farmer from Manakal village in Lalgudi in Trichy.

When contacted, a senior official from Tangedco, Thennur Trichy told TOI that this was in practice a few years ago for ordinary agriculture power connections too. As per the government’s notification, this initiative is being implemented, he said.

“This is only for study purpose, to ascertain the average consumption and total consumption per month of a particular connection. As per norms of the scheme, fixation of a meter is being done,” he added.

Meanwhile, secretary of Thanjavur district Cauvery farmers’ protection association Swamimalai S Vimalnathan alleged that it was a clear indication that charges would be levied for the power supply.

“If they want to study anything, they can do it from the transformer itself. They need not spend money on procuring meter and fixing it with motor pumps,” he added.

The issue came to light after an animal welfare organization received images and videos of cats being chased and tortured.It is alleged that before killing the cats, the animals were choked using steel ropes and placed in plastic sacks.According to Humane Society International/India (HSI/India), the animal welfare organisation that wrote to the Director General of Police, the Secretary of the Resident Welfare Association of the gated community issued a letter stating that a ‘team’ was hired to catch stray cats and residents must cooperate.HSI/India’s managing director Alokparna Sengupta who had forwarded the complaint to the DGP said, “There has been a rise in cruelty against street animals in affluent gated communities.

The community could have easily contacted an animal protection organization to seek help in a humane manner.”When TOI spoke to one of the complainants who brought the issue to the fore, it was informed on condition of anonimity that the decision to trap the cats came after a few residents complained to the secretary on the WhatsApp group about cat menace in the community.“These cats are very friendly and were fed by few residents of the gated community. The decision to trap them came after someone complained to the secretary of the community following which a few people trapped these cats.”“The people who were hired were promised Rs 500 for each cat they trapped. They chased about four cats and used steel ropes to catch them by their necks.

Thiruvananthapuram: Over 300 encroachments covering footpaths and blocking the walkway of pedestrians have been identified in three zones as part of an audit conducted by the town-planning wing.

Shops jutting on to walkways and unauthorized street vendors are also included in the list compiled by three zones: Central zone, Fort zone and Kazhakootam.

The town-planning committee, which received the list of encroachments from central zone and Kazhakootam zone last week, received the list from Fort zone on Friday. Town-planning committee will present the list before mayor K Sreekumar in a meeting to be held on Tuesday. The final action on removing the encroachments and freeing the footpaths for pedestrians will be initiated after the meeting.

Multiple teams, led by respective assistant executive engineers, will be deployed in what is going to be a simultaneous eviction drive in all the zones. Two new vending zones are also likely to be announced this month; one at Museum and another at Poojappura.

The corporation has so far conducted two surveys of street vendors. As per the first survey, 1,884 vendors have been identified of which, 509 have been issued ID cards.

Licences have not been distributed to any of the vendors so far. Around 1,500 vendors were identified in the second survey.

Meanwhile, a seven-member team, led by executive engineer and assistant revenue officer, has begun processing the files received from various commercial establishments in response to the notice served on them regarding parking violations.

Details of each building from tax assessment register have been collected from the revenue wing and handed over to the team. The team is expected to finalise the report on file processing by next week. Palayam Rajan, chairman, town planning committee said removal of encroachments from footpaths and parking violations in the city are being handled with utmost priority by the town planning standing committee.

“During the audit, we have come across unauthorised street vendors occupying lion share of footpaths depriving pedestrians of the space. Some of the shops have also been found extended unlawfully on to the footpath,” said Rajan.

Actor Vijay would not have faced any action from the income tax department, if he too had backed the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA), CPI state secretary R Mutharasan said in Trichy on Saturday.

Actor Rajinikanth has expressed his support to the CAA, only to safeguard himself from any legal action from the Centre in connection with income tax issues, he told reporters while commenting on the actor’s recent statement.

Aurangabad: Aurangabad Mahasangh, an apex body of different social groups and mandals that celebrates Shiv Jayanti every year, has demanded that the birth anniversary of Chhatrapati Shivaji must be celebrated as per the English calendar across the state on February 19.

In a memorandum submitted to the state government, Mahasangh founder president Prithviraj Pawar has sought an official end to the row over separate celebrations taking place on Shiv Jayanti as per Hindu calendar.

“The date February 19 has been officially decided as the birth date of Chhatrapati Shivaji by an expert committee set up by the state government almost two decades ago. Despite this, the row over different celebrations continues in Maharashtra. To bring an end to the issue, we demand that Shiv Jayanti must be celebrated as per the English calendar year across Maharashtra on February 19,” he said.

While Shiv Jayanti as per English calendar is round the corner, it falls on March 12 this year as per Hindu calendar.

Stating that Chhatrapati Shivaji is an inspiration for every generation, Pawar said that it is inappropriate to celebrate the birth anniversary of such a towering personality on two different occasions.

Incidentally, the appeal made by Aurangabad Mahasangh is likely to put local unit of Shiv Sena in tight spot as the saffron party celebrates Shiv Jayanti as per Hindu calendar every year. Earlier, NCP leader Amol Mitkari had appealed to chief minister Uddhav Thackeray to celebrate Shiv Jayanti on February 19.

BJP MLA and son of ex-CM Narayan Rane has already appealed to the government to end the ‘row’ over Shiv Jayanti. “The NCP is in power at present and, therefore, only one Shiv Jayanti celebration must take place. Let’s bring an end to the row over two celebrations,” he tweeted.

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: In a major development in the Kattakkada Sangeeth Balan murder case, four policemen attached to Kattakkada police station were placed under suspension pending inquiry for the alleged laxity they displayed in reaching the crime scene on time, allowing ample time for the assailants to escape.

Additional sub-inspector Anilkumar and civil police officers Harikumar , Baiju and Sukesh are the officers who were placed under suspension. They were all on night duty at Kattakkada police station on the intervening night of January 23 and 24 when the murder took place. The suspension order was issued by deputy inspector general ( Thiruvananthapuram ) Kori Sanjaykumar Gurudin based on an preliminary inquiry report submitted by Nedumangad DSP Stuart Keeler.

The DSP had concluded his report stating that there was a delay of more than an hour for the cops to reach the crime scene at Kattakkada which was only 7km away from the Kattakkada police station. At night, when the vehicular traffic along the roads are very less, the cops could have reached the spot in a few minutes.

Speaking to TOI, superintendent of police (Rural District) B Ashok said that a formal inquiry has been launched into the alleged dereliction of duty of the four cops. An officer of the rank of deputy superintendent will be assigned to conduct the inquiry. The inquiry officer is yet to be decided, the Rural SP said.

Sangeeth Balan, 37, was allegedly murdered during the wee hours of January 24 by a gang of real estate mafia, who were trying to dig soil illegally from his plot. The gang turned up at his property with an excavator and a tipper lorry. When Sangeeth tried to prevent them from digging the earth, they attacked him. The gang hit him using the bucket of the excavator, inflicting serious injuries that eventually caused his death.

Aurangabad: Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar Marathwada University ( Bamu ) will form a special supervisory body to oversee the functioning of different study centres run under its aegis.

Bamu vice chancellor Pramod Yeole said all the study centres would be clubbed under the new body.

“A special complex will be also raised under which different existing study centres will be brought together. We have decided to appoint a special director-level officer to manage the functioning of the new supervisory body for the existing study centres,” he said.

Yeole, while speaking at the inauguration of study centre named after the 12th-century poet from Marathwada, Mukundraj, on Friday, also appealed to the authorities to broaden the horizon of the existing study centres.

“These centres must undertake activities and projects in keeping with the social relevance and emerging challenges,” he said.

Bamu, which is considered as one of the oldest universities in the country, has around 14 study centres named after different individuals. These include centres in the memory of Shivaji Maharaj, Rajashtri Shahu Maharaj, Bhagat Sing, Annabhau Sathe, Wamandada Kardak, Vasantrao Naik, Gautam Budhha, Mahatma Gandhi, Maulana Azad, C V Raman Tarabai Shinde and others.

Student activist Tukaram Saraf said, “The study centres at Bamu are by and large under-utilised so far. These are key bodies which can be used for social research among other works. The university administration must maintain these centres in order to achieve a larger goal,” he said.

BAMU was criticised by the National Assessment and Accreditation Council (NAAC) over the alleged expansion of study centres under the university.

The peer team of NAAC, in its official report submitted on March 29 after carrying out an assessment of the university, had observed that Bamu “spreading its resources thin by creating too many chairs and centres.” The NAAC authorities had listed such decisions under the ‘weakness’ category of the university in its official report.

The teachers said that asking them submit such an undertaking was a move to turn them into scapegoats.

“We are doing our best to ensure that all students clear SSC examination by strictly adhering to the board’s timetable and making students take practice tests. However, even after giving our best, there is a chance that a student may fail. Asking us to give undertaking is not fair,” said M Ravinder, president, Telangana Progressive Teachers Federation .

“You are hereby informed to give a certificate of undertaking about students identified by you with lower performance in your subject in special practice test held in August 2019,” read the proforma of the undertaking being circulated in the schools. “I do hereby declare that I will take responsibility of improving the academic standards of the above students and put my best efforts to ensure their improvement in my school,” states the acknowledgement.

Teachers said that they are not ready to submit any such undertaking and added that they have even raised this issue with the officials.

While the DEO, Hyderabad refused to comment on the issue, officials in the department said the undertaking would ensure that teachers put in their best.

“If they are doing their best in preparing students, what’s stopping them from giving the same in written?” questioned an official.

TRICHY: A group of residents of Gunaseelam village engaged in an altercation with the officials of the public works department (PWD) at Manjakorai in Trichy on Saturday over the commencement of quarry operations along the Cauvery.

Citing the stay vacated by the Madras high court, the PWD started operating the newly-opened quarry in full swing at Manjakorai on Friday.

Quarrying near the village triggered unrest among a section of people prompting them to oppose the operations on Saturday morning. The agitated villagers tried to block the Trichy-Namakkal Road near Gunaseelam on Saturday. But, PWD officials and Trichy district police reacted quickly and prevented them from blocking the road and held talks with them. According to the villagers, drinking water level will be hit if quarrying was carried out in the area. They also recalled a previous case filed by the villagers against the proposal to quarry in the area several years ago. PWD officials attempted to assuage the villagers stating that the quarry operation was carried out with proper environmental clearance in August 2018 and a Madras high court order in November 2019.

The officials said that a resident of the village moved the high court seeking stay on the environment clearance citing drinking water depletion. The court appointed a committee to verify the facts. The committee also visited the spot and submitted a report following which the court gave nod for the quarry operation. Following this, the PWD officials started preliminary work to carry out quarry operation on 24 hectares along the river as per the guidelines of the court. Sand can be mined for one metre depth as per the order. Mined sand will be transported to the government sand depot at Konalai where the online registered trucks can load minimum two units and maximum three units of sand with a price of Rs 1,330 per unit.

The officials tried to convince the agitating people saying that 1.78 lakh units can be mined from the area without causing any harm to the environment. The villagers still argued.

He told GHMC ’s engineering wing officials that Rs 5 crore was sanctioned for road repair and construction of culverts at various places in Secunderabad .

However, the roads are damaged every time a portion is dug up to lay water or sewer lines, thereby wasting the money that was utilised to repair it,” said Padma Rao, adding, “A system that is being followed in Delhi to drain rainwater must be implemented in the city also.

380,['9/02/2020'],CAT questions AP on delay in IRS officer’s repatriation,"This story is from February 9, 2020

Hyderabad: The Central Administrative Tribunal (CAT), Hyderabad, on Friday reserved its orders in a plea filed by suspended IRS officer J Krishna Kishore who challenged the punitive action taken by the Andhra Pradesh government against him.

A bench comprising tribunal chairman Justice L Narasimha Reddy and member (administration) BV Sudhakar earlier stayed the suspension and sought the version of the state government as to why it was proceeding against the officer. The IRS officer was an income-tax commissioner and, on a request from Andhra Pradesh under TDP regime, came to AP Economic Development Board (APEDB) as its CEO in 2015 on deputation.

However, in July 2019, the current YSRCP regime shifted him to the general administration department. In December, it suspended him and ordered ACB and CID probes against him on the grounds that he had committed certain irregularities during his stint with APEDB.

Senior counsel Neeraj Malhotra argued the case of Kishore and said the government had crossed its brief and was acting with a sense of vengeance against him. The IRS officer was part of the income tax probe against Jagathi Publications, a firm owned by AP chief minister Jaganmohan Reddy, and the findings of this probe team were not liked by Jagathi management.

“They had, in fact, challenged the findings of the probe team before higher judicial forums,” he said.

Neeraj expressed apprehensions whether this background is working against Kishore now. “Since the income-tax department is also asking the government to repatriate him, let there be a direction from this court ordering immediate repatriation of the officer. He was promoted as a principal commissioner of income tax and all his batchmates have joined in the new posts. Any delay here will make him a junior officer there,” he added.

Appearing for the AP government, senior counsel D Prakash Reddy argued that government has jurisdiction to act against the central employees if they are working with it on deputation and its interests were adversely affected by the actions of such employees. He refuted the allegation that the state was acting against the officer with malice.

“It was Kishore who sought repatriation to the Centre immediately after YSRCP came to power in AP,” he said. The bench, however, has made it clear that it will not go into the personal allegations that each party is making. The bench sought to know from the government whether it is ready to send the officer back to the Centre.

“If you (government) want to conduct a probe into the alleged irregularities committed by him, you are free to do so. You have already moved him out of APEDB. Why this suspension which looks like a double punishment? Where is the need to retain him here?” the bench asked.

Prakash said if the officer is sent back to Delhi, then the probe in AP would suffer. The bench reserved its judgement.

By: Omer bin Taher

HYDERABAD: Advocates from the Telangana advocates JAC gathered at the Dharna Chowk near Indira Park to register their protest against Citizenship Amendment Act ( CAA ).

The advocates said that CAA violates articles 14 and 21 of the constitution.

The lawyers stressed upon chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao to pass a resolution in the state assembly with a strong recommendation to the central government by noting that the Citizenship Amendment Act , amended passport rules, foreign order amendments are “class legislations harping, interalia, on the religious identity of an individual.”

“We appreciate and welcome the stand of the TRS government as it has registered a protest against CAA and NRC. But it can be understood in a practical manner when the government passes a resolution in the state assembly and follow it up by filing a case under Article 131 of Indian Constitution,” said Muzzar Ullah Khan, an advocate.

The advocates JAC also requested the state government to allow citizens to organise protests against the Act and grant police permission. It further said that JAC had committed to extend all possible legal aids to those who stand against CAA,and NRC.

Meanwhile, Congress leader P. Chidambaram and TPCC president Uttam Kumar Reddy met protesting advocates and read the preamble of the Constitution and sung the national anthem with the advocates.

Ahmedabad: In a first, two persons have been sentenced imprisonment for one month in a case related to intellectual property right. A local court has ordered to send them to civil imprisonment for disobeying court order and thereby committing contempt of the court.

Two owners of a fitness centre in Makarba, Alamkhan Pathan and Muhibullah Saiyed, have been ordered one-month imprisonment for not changing the name ‘I Gymholic’ of their fitness centre. Their former partner, Ishan Qureshi, had been claiming exclusive trademark right over the branch and had sued them for usurping his trademark.

In 2018, Qureshi sued Pathan and Saiyed in Ahmedabad district court for trademark infringement claiming that he had started the gym in Makarba in partnership. It was named as ‘I Gymholic’, in which I stands for Ishran. Later, there was a dispute between partners, and Qureshi started a separate fitness centre in Bopal. His partners, however, continued to use the same brand, to which he registered his protest.

In September 2019, the court restrained Pathan and Saiyed from using the brand and ordered them to remove the name ‘I Gymholic’ within three days from receipt of its order.

According to Qureshi’s advocate Rushvi Shah, Pathan and Saiyed did not remove the name and continued to run their fitness centre under the same title. The court was informed about the development and action was demanded against the duo for contempt of court for not following court’s order. “The court has awarded one-month jail to both the defendants for not following the court order,” she said.

The lawyer also said, “The court has ordered plaintiff (Qureshi) to pay for the subsistence allowance for both the persons during their custody which will be of civil nature.” After awarding one-month civil imprisonment, the court directed its Nazir (court staff) “to accept Rs 10,000 against the subsistence allowance for keeping the defendants in civil imprisonment for one month… An endorsement to be also made by the Nazir disclosing the total subsistence allowance required in this case for keeping two defendants in civil imprisonment for one month.”

The court, however, has granted time to Pathan and Saiyed to appeal against the order of civil imprisonment.

GANDHINAGAR: Former deputy Prime Minister and BJP patriarch L K Advani , 92, ended his three-decade-old relationship as a voter from Gandhinagar Lok Sabha constituency and Ahmedabad’s Jamalpur-Khadia constituency. On Saturday, Advani voted in the Delhi assembly elections from his “permanent” address. It was after the 1991 Lok Sabha polls when Advani had contested from New Delhi and Gandhinagar, that the BJP veteran had won from Gandhinagar with a handsome margin, and moved from New Delhi to Gujarat, his ‘karmabhoomi’ as an MP.In Ahmedabad, Advani was a registered voter from Jamalpur-Khadia assembly constituency. The BJP’s old office at Pandit Dayal Bhavan, JP Chowk, Khanpur, in Ahmedabad was listed as his address.On Saturday, Advani voted at Atal Adarsh Vidyalaya, on Aurangzeb Road in New Delhi assembly constituency in the Delhi state assembly elections. Advani last voted in Lok Sabha election in May 2019 in Ahmedabad.Chief electoral officer and ex-officio secretary to state general administration department (Election) S Murali Krishna said: “L K Advani’s name has been shown in the deleted voters list in our records. So he must have applied in Ahmedabad RO office. If he has got his name deleted from Ahmedabad electoral rolls and registered in New Delhi he can vote there now but not here any more.'”Surprisingly, Advani's name appeared as a voter in Gujarat chief electoral officer (CEO) website in Delhi and in Gujarat when TOI checked on Saturday. TOI has screenshots of both websites as they do not seem to be updated.In 1991, BJP leader Advani had fought for the first time from Lok Sabha on two seats, New Delhi and Gandhinagar, as he was being projected as BJP’s prime ministerial candidate that year. In New Delhi, he faced a stiff competition from Congress candidate and Bollywood superstar Rajesh Khanna and barely managed a win by a thin margin of 1,589 votes. In Gandhinagar, Advani won by a mammoth margin of 1.25 lakh.Advani resigned from the New Delhi constituency and then Khanna won in the New Delhi byelection. The superstar came back to haunt Advani in the 1996 byelection of Gandhinagar Lok Sabha after A B Vajpayee who was then BJP’s prime ministerial candidate won but resigned from Gandhinagar and kept the Lucknow seat. That year, Advani refrained from contesting elections in the wake of the Jain hawala diary case. Advani chose not to contest the 1996 Lok Sabha election till his name was cleared. But in 1998, Advani won from Gandhinagar and since then represented the constituency till 2019 when BJP national party president Amit Shah was fielded from Gandhinagar and won.",ahmedabad,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74039047,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-502209,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/advani-ends-tie-with-gujarat-as-a-voter-after-three-decades/articleshow/74035342.cms

To nurture best values from childhood and to protect our culture, Mother-Father Worship Day message should be given.”Apart from instructions to organise the ‘worship day’, the schools have also been asked to send photos of the event in reply to the DEO.The letter also instructs schools on how to celebrate the day.The schools will have to call five to 10 parents belonging to different religions and castes. They will also have to invite members of Nagar Prathmik Shikshan Samiti’s members, Surat Municipal Corporation (SMC) members, municipal councillors, educationalist or social worker to witness the event.“In the event, the children should worship their parents in accordance to Indian tradition with tilak, garland, vandan – with folded hands, circumambulating in pradakshina and offering them sweets.

KOCHI: Even though central government recently banned the consumption, production, sale and transportation of e-cigarette, lack of awareness about the ban amongst air passengers from foreign countries is turning out to be a headache for CISF staff at the Cochin International Airport Ltd (Cial). Arguments over possession of banned e-cigarattes have become quite frequent at the security counter at the airport.Around six cases were reported over the past one month. Security officials said passengers cite lack of proper warning by airlines as the main reason for carrying e-cigarette. According to airport sources, many passengers are coming with e-cigarettes in their baggage, which are being seized during security checks, mostly during the departure times.CISF officials said that e-cigarettes are brought by the passengers for personal consumption as its use is legal in other countries. “Though they are not supposed to bring in e-cigarettes, during immigration these e-cigarettes go unnoticed as the customs officials haven’t yet started seizing them. But when these passengers return they will have to go through thorough checking and frisking. Though we try to inform them about the ban, they argue that no intimations were given about the ban during the visa application time or by the airlines during ticket booking,” said an official.E-cigarettes are the most common form of electronic nicotine delivery systems (Ends). These are basically devices that do not burn or use tobacco leaves. Instead, they vaporize a solution using a battery. This vapour is then inhaled by the user.E-cigarettes were promoted as a way to get people out of their smoking habits but reports have shown that many people are not using it as a weaning mechanism but are rather addicted to it. The finance ministry in September announced a ban on e-cigarettes saying they pose health risks to the youth as their addiction is increasing.Officials said that there is a need to highlight e-cigarettes as a banned product and give awareness to air passengers not to carry it. “Unless proper awareness is given, there is no use in banning it. The price of these items range from Rs 450 to Rs 30,000 and custom-made e-cigarettes are even costlier. Passengers argue with us more when the seized product is pricey,” said an official.Customs officials also said that though the item is banned, there are no directions to the officials regarding checking and seizures of e-cigarettes. “During immigration we mostly check for those items prohibited under the Section 11 of Customs Act. As of now there are no directions to seize e-cigarettes from passengers. Moreover, it is impractical to check each passenger for e-cigarette unless it is brought in bulk quantities. So the problem comes during departure as CISF will be screening each of the passengers,” said a senior customs official.",kochi,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74038828,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-27574,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/despite-ban-air-passengers-continue-to-carry-e-cigarettes/articleshow/74035300.cms

LUCKNOW: The denizens of the city wore their patriotism high on their sleeves and marched to the Defence Expo venues in swarms from all corners, stood in lines for hours without any signs of fatigue and cheered each other by intermittently shouting ‘How’s the josh?’ and a loud ‘High Sir!’ reverberating in response.

“Nawabon ka shehar, sena ke shaurya ka shehar, Bharat ke vir jawanon ki jai,” were some slogans that echoed at Vrindavan Yojana, the Defence Expo venue open to public for free on Saturday for the first time.

People started trooping at 5am, stood in serpentine queues extending up to 3km and later even climbed nearby trees, buildings to get a glimpse of the live demonstrations of the Indian Army and Air Force personnel in action.

“I came at 6am but got to witness the live show in the afternoon due to massive crowd, but I’m not upset as I came for our soldiers who stake their lives to save our borders,” said advocate Amit Srivastava.

People waited in queues moving at a caterpillar’s speed with excitement for their turns to pose with battle tanks, aircraft and missiles on display.

“I gasped after climbing up a tank to take a selfie, salute to our Army which operates it in extreme temperatures,” said Anurag Kashyap, a student.

Jaipur: From 34,000 students about six years ago to over two lakh, Canada is becoming a preferred destination for Indian youths, replacing China and the US. Building on the new relation, the country is looking to expand its engagement with India on fresh frontiers.

In a first, Canada is reaching out to the business communities of 10 tier-II cities in India, including Rajasthan , seeking collaboration and investment. Recently, a delegation led by Canadian commercial minister Andrew Smith and CEO of Indo-Canadian Business Chamber (ICBC) Nadira Hamid, expressed Canada’s eagerness to partner with the small and medium industries of the Pink City.

Smith said, “Our traditional industries are in commodities and agriculture. But we want to broaden to new areas. Canadian companies are not very large. That’s why I wanted to explore whether Indian SMEs in tier-II cities might be a better match for the Canadian SMEs.”

He said India produces 8.5 lakh computer engineers and scientists every year and there are large numbers of startups in India. “They provide us the best opportunities to work on new technologies like Internet of Things, block chain, cyber security, agri-tech, clean tech, and connected vehicles. We want to find synergy in these new areas where the SMEs of both the countries can work together and develop the future trade relationships,” Smith added.

Currently, the bilateral trade between India and Canada stands at around $6.7 billion and Canada expects the volumes to increase to $25 billion in the next five years.

Hamid said after the roadshows in 10 tier-II cities, they will analyse potential areas where alliances can be forged. “Interactions with the SMEs in the roadshow will give us understanding on how we can build new partnerships. In the next level, we will try to engage in a more specific way with the companies.”

Arun Agarwal, executive president of Federation of Rajasthan Trade and Industry, who attended the roadshow, said there is potential for investing in Canada and also developing alliances in multiple areas

Representative image

AHMEDABAD: A study has placed Gujarat at the 8th rank among major Indian states in its capacity to deliver justice to citizens.

The study titled ‘India Justice Report’ was undertaken by Tata Trusts in collaboration with the Centre for Social Justice (CSJ) and various other organizations. The report was launched at the Gujarat National Law University on Saturday. The survey conducted, and the study of data received from the governments revealed that Maharashtra tops the list of 18 major and mid-size states in justice delivery .

The states’ performances have been evaluated on basis of police department’s performance, prison conditions and their staff, functioning of judiciary and the legal aid services prevalent in the states in last few years.

According the report, Gujarat has fared reasonably well on the front of judiciary and legal aid securing 7th and 6th ranks respectively. But, the condition of police department and prisons pulls it back to overall 8th rank because the functioning of police was ranked 12th and prison conditions at 9th.

The study has also ranked the states in respect of their intentions to improve as seen in last five years by analysing recent trends. In this, Gujarat ranks third with West Bengal and Maharastra ahead of it.

Though Gujarat fares poorly on police functioning, it has been praised for improving gender ratio after 2015-16 when the Anandiben Patel-government introduced 33% reservation for women in recruitment.

Gujarat still suffers from 31.5% vacancy at constabulary level with nearly one out of three positions remaining unfilled. The national average vacancy is of 21.2%. Over a period of five years, vacancies showed a declining trend.

In Gujarat prisons, 32% posts are vacant. The national average is 33%. Women representation among jail officials is the lowest at 5.5% as against the national average of 10%.

In Gujarat’s judiciary, the report highlighted that only one out of 10 judges in the Gujarat high court is a woman.

JAIPUR: Rajasthan Tourism Development Corporation (RTDC) hotels and compounds can now sell Indian Made Foreign Liquor (IMFL), beer, heritage liquor and foreign booze from their counters, says the new excise and temperance policy released by the state government on Saturday.Liquor sale at RTDC bars and counters was stopped in 2004.“But after the government received complaints about shops selling liquor at inflated rates, the government decided to reopen the counters at the hotels,” an official said.The policy also mandates that country liquor shops should sell 30% ENA (extra neutral alcohol)-based Rajasthan Made Liquor (RML) and introduce MRP on it.The policy also focuses on providing good quality liquor to consumers and put a check on alcohol consumption.“The state government will issue notification for conducting lotteries soon. The applicants can start applying from February 11-12. The first lottery will be conducted in the first the week of March. There is a provision that this new policy is likely to continue in 2021-22. The heritage liquor, which is manufactured at the Rajasthan State Ganganagar Sugar Mill, will be given major focus and will be promoted at the national and international levels,” it added.The government has also decided to take a tough stand on illicit liquor. “On the lines of Uttar Pradesh, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu, the government shall replace 30% of the volume of country liquor by ENA-based RML in a phased manner. To check sale of illicit liquor, 3 per cent of RML will be sold in tetra packs,” the official added.RML is available in form whiskey, rum, gin and vodka. “Liquor will be prepared using ENA, which is a better quality spirit. It will be sold at affordable rates,” the document states.To ensure transparency and abolition of inspector raj, the state plans to set up Points of Sale (PoS) and issue sale receipts to customers, an official said.The policy document also talks about strengthening the excise department by e-auctioning vehicles used in illegal transportation of liquor seized by it and police in 2020-21. The move is estimated to fetch Rs 25 crore of which 50 per cent will be given to the department for purchasing logistics. It also proposes setting up excise laboratories in Bharatpur and Bahrod.“According to the policy, the state government will focus on three things — temperance, responsible drinking and social responsibility. Revenue generation is one of the objectives of the government, but not primary. Temperance and running a campaign to discourage people from consuming liquor will be the primary objective so far as implementation of this policy is concerned. De-addiction centres will be set up on similar lines of Kerala,” said an official.The number of IMFL (1,000) and country liquor shops (6,665) has not been increased and the timing for the sale of liquor remains the same from 10am to 8pm, the policy says.“We have also started the concept of geo-tagging and the location of the shops has to be approved online by the district excise officer (DEO). In addition, it has been proposed that liquor shops should not be located within 200 metres of anganwadis, along with schools and religious places (which was introduced earlier),” the official said.",jaipur,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74038738,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-127344,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/now-you-can-buy-booze-from-rtdc-hotel-counters/articleshow/74036146.cms

MUMBAI: Two medical students from Wuhan who landed in Mumbai on January 25 were placed in isolation at BMC’s Kasturba Hospital on Friday, February 7, and tested for the 2019 Novel Coronavirus (nCoV).It is not clear how these 24-year-old medical students, who hail from Kerala, reached Andheri despite the central health ministry’s guideline to test every traveller from Wuhan—the epicentre of the 2019-nCoV outbreak— for the virus even if they are asymptomatic.“We got a call from Kasaragod (Kerala) health officials stating that these two medical students are in Mumbai and should be picked up for testing,” said Maharashtra Disease Surveillance Officer Dr Pradeep Awate on Saturday. The state health officials then called the students who willingly came to Kasturba, near Saat Raasta.“Both these medical students left Wuhan on January 22 and are without symptoms so far,” said BMC’s additional municipal commissioner S Kakani. Their swab samples are being tested at Kasturba, but have also been sent to National Institute of Virology (NIV), Pune.

398,['9/02/2020'],KSFE upbeat despite Rs 110cr drop in profit,"This story is from February 9, 2020

Thiruvananthapuram: A steep fall in profit is not necessarilyan indicator of debilitating financial health. It is so at least in the case of Kerala State Financial Enterprises (KSFE), which, as per a review report by state bureau of public enterprises, has posted a significant slump of around Rs 110 crore in its profit for the 2018-19 fiscal.

The report tabled in the assembly, along with other budget documents, sheds light on a seemingly disturbing fact about the financial health of KSFE. In the summary of performance, the report said the public enterprise’s profit plummeted by 57.39%. According to the report, KSFE’s profit dropped despite a much impressive annual growth of 14.38% in its gross income. The gross income of KSFE jumped by Rs 301 crore to Rs 2,473.61 crore in 2018-19 from Rs 2,161.68 crore during the previous fiscal.

But in the balance sheet, the profit of the public enterprise tumbled to Rs 81.36 crore from Rs 190.93 crore in the previous financial year. “It is reported that it is mainly due to an increased expenses of employee benefits and other expenses incurred by the company during the year under review,” concluded the public enterprises review report, leaving room for speculation about KSFE’s financial health.

But the state economic review report tells a different story. It shows that thePSE achieved a strong financial strength despite incurring a significant reduction in profit. According to the report, the company has jacked up its reserve and surplus by Rs 315 crore in the 2018-19 financial year, taking its cash reserve to a whopping Rs 854 crore as against Rs 620 crore as on March 2017.

People in the know say it was a well-thought-out move anticipating possible action by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) aimed at non-banking finance companies like KSFE, especially since financial experts have started blaming the liquidity crisis faced by NBFCs, including IL&FS and DHFL, for the current financial stress in the market. Words of KSFE chairman Peelipose Thomas give credence to such arguments.

“The profit slump doesn’t set the alarm bells ringing in the case of KSFE. It’s not accidental, but the result of a deliberate and cautious decision we have taken in consultation with competent authorities in the government. KSFE, no doubt, is in the pink of health. Anybody who goes through our gross income figures can find it so. We simply don’t want to fall into a crisis if at all the RBI, sometime in the future, asks us to keep reserve and surplus on par with what it stipulates for banking institutions,” Thomas said.

The decision to set apart a large chunk of gross income to reserve and surplus would help KSFE to achieve a more formidable financial position that could help the institution address possible changes in the RBI rules. “KSFE would continue to build up its reserve and surplus more in the coming years, even if it means that its profit doesn’t look that flashy,” he said.

Nooran Sisters will perform on February 14 at 8.30pm

AHMEDABAD: The stillness of the riverfront props up one side of Mallika Sarabhai ’s Darpana Academy of Performing Arts . A torrent of traffic holds up the other end.

In the academy’s red-brick calmness — lying between blue-green water and blurred colours of flowing traffic — Sarabhai conducts inquiries into truth and beauty, which Keats argued become one.

That oneness will be the theme of the Nooran Sisters ’ performance at Natarani, on Darpana’s campus, on February 14. The sisters are hailed as the ‘Queens of Sufi music’. “We are delighted that we are bringing the sisters for the first time to Ahmedabad,” Sarabhai told TOI. “Sufi music is powered by the yearning for the beloved: that beloved could be divinity.” It is fitting that the sisters will sing of love on Valentine ’s Day.

The quest for wholeness, completed with the union with God, is a motif that has produced the brightest moments of plaintiveness in music. In the Carnatic tradition, for instance, Saint Thyagaraja’s kriti “Nanu palimpa nadaci vaccitivo” imagines that God has disregarded the minor logistic inconvenience of travelling from heaven to earth. God makes that trip because the call of love cannot be ignored. The Telugu line, roughly translated, means: “Have you walked all the way to save me?”

The Nooran Sisters — Jyoti and Sultana — come from Jalandhar and are in their twenties. But their voices carry the ageless echoes of spiritual longing.

From their padmasana pose on the stage, they erupt with the lava of rockstar energy.

Their molten notes have made audiences jump off the seats in India, the US, Canada, and Bangladesh. Their hits include “Patakha Guddi”, “Allah hu”, and “Jugni”.

Sarabhai told TOI that Darpana does not eschew everyday concerns in its meditations on art.

Arthur Miller believed that a good newspaper is a nation talking to itself.

Art, then, could be beauty asking life to tell the truth. After the sisters perform, Amdavadis will perhaps suspend their worries about commuting to office the next morning and think about the destination where art answers honest questions.

BENGALURU: A techie is suspected to have drowned after he fell into Kalkere Lake in the early hours of Saturday. He and his friend had partied till late night before they ventured into the water body on a coracle .

Sachin Machaiah, 27, was employed with a private company in Manyata Tech Park and lived in Electronics City. He fell into the lake around 3am when the coracle capsized after the duo lost balance. His friend Ullas, a resident of Ramamurthynagar, escaped by swimming to the shore, police said.

Swimmers and rescue personnel were deployed to trace Sachin, but couldn’t make any breakthrough till evening. The search operation will resume on Sunday, police said.

Preliminary investigations revealed Sachin and Ullas were good friends for several years and were colleagues till six months ago when Ullas moved to a new job. They had partied near the lake several times in the past and sat down to chat on Friday night as well. After midnight, they sneaked inside the lake area through the rear gate by hoodwinking security guard Rajesh Erappa, who was stationed at the front gate.

Based on Ullas’ statement, police said the two decided to go for a boat ride and picked up a coracle that was lying nearby. Though there were no paddles around, the two sailed for a few feet in the water when the coracle rocked. While Ullas swam to safety and raised an alarm, Sachin did not make it to the shore. Earappa rushed to the spot and alerted police.

A senior officer from the fire and emergency department said the coracle could have capsized as Sachin weighed more than Ullas. “There should be a balance of weight in the coracle. Gathering from Ullas’ statements, we assume Sachin was sitting on the right corner. As the coracle moved, it tilted to the right and capsized,” an officer said. Sachin hailed from Virajpet in Kodagu and had got married last year.

KOCHI: All help will be provided to the seafood sector by the central government to make India the number one exporter, said minister of state for commerce and industry Som Parkash. India occupies fourth position now.

He was addressing the 22nd India International Seafood Show in Kochi on Saturday. The minister stressed the importance of “working together with a new vigour with all the stakeholders, including the state governments and the Marine Products Export Development Authority (MPEDA)”.

Acknowledging that the sector was facing a plethora of problems in achieving the production and export targets without compromising on quality and environment, the minister said that the government was willing to address each issue as it would contribute to the country’s overall economic development besides improving employment opportunities. At present, the sector provides employment to about 14.5 million people in the country.

The newly-instituted MPEDA chairman’s award for Most Responsible Exporter of the Year 2018-19 was given to Gadre Marine Products Pvt Ltd, Ratnagiri, Maharashtra. The Lifetime Achievement Award, another new initiative, went to Abraham J Tharakan , chairman and managing director of Kerala’s Amalgam Group.

State fisheries minister J Mercykutty Amma sought liberal financial assistance from the Centre for upgradation of the fishing industry in Kerala, including for replacement of the kerosene engine by more environment-friendly engines and for expansion of inland aquaculture . “Finance from the Centre was required also for implementing the state’s plan to popularize deep sea fishing,” she said.

The seafood exporters emphasized that the government should also ensure that the Chinese market remained open to India, particularly in view of the fact that the neighbouring country had become a net importer. A plea was also made to relook at policy matters relating to primary producers and exports.

It was also pointed out at the meet that Andhra Pradesh and a few other states had taken a march over Kerala in shrimp aquaculture and advised the producers to be extremely cautious on environmental issues.

Residents enjoy the boat trail in the city on Saturday

LUCKNOW: Once considered as an agent of salvation and lifeline of Lucknow, Gomti is now neither clean nor sacred. Rather, one may contract disease just by stepping into its shallow waters.

To highlight the importance of the river, Lucknow chapter of Indian National Trust for Art and Cultural Heritage (INTACH) organised a boat trail ‘Nadi Mein Naadswar’, from Shaheed Smarak to Kudia Ghat, on Saturday.

Amid reverberations of old Bollywood songs and with more 120 residents on 17 boats, the trail covered city’s skyline of domes and minarets, followed by an intricate discussion on regulatory interventions that may be adopted to contribute towards a cleaner Gomti.

Convener of INTACH Vipul B Varshney said, “The need for this programme was felt when helmsmen at Shaheed Smarak refused for a boat ride stating that nothing can pass through the river due to blockage by water hyacinth and garbage. Several solutions were suggested by city-based environmentalists and professors of IIT-Kanpur.”

The measures included mapping and demarcation of the entire Gomti floodplain from the source to confluence with river Ganga. The silt which has been deposited in the riverbed along major settlements in Lucknow, Jaunpur, Sultanpur and 11 other districts should be removed.

According to experts, sugar factories and distilleries located along the river in Sitapur and upstream should be strictly monitored as they are known for discharging major pollutants in the river.

Later, speaking during panel discussion experts said no construction work should be allowed on 250km stretch along river Gomti, and a river garden should be developed along it.

They said significant incentives for afforestation along the river banks for next 10 years should also be announced by the government. The river garden should create a micro-ecosystem for birds, insects, flora and fauna, they added.

City-based historian Yogesh Praveen said Gomti should be declared the state river of Uttar Pradesh.

He said to revive the river, city’s drainage system should be improved and dumping of solid waste in the river should be prohibited.

“Nawab Wajid Ali Shah used to organise cultural festivals on the river banks while other nawabs owned steam vehicles for pleasure rides. Chhatar Manzil would be lit up and dance and music on various boats would go all night. It could have been Seine or Thames of Lucknow, but sadly it is nothing near that now. A concrete plan has to be chalked out by the government to revive it before it becomes invisible from the map of Lucknow in future,” said Praveen.

Madhya Pradesh chief minister Kamal Nath

BHOPAL: Director general of police V K Singh had a lengthy closed room meeting with chief minister Kamal Nath on Saturday, a day after Madhya Pradesh government rejected a panel of three IPS officers sent by UPSC for director general of police on the grounds that it overlooked “willingness” of one of them.

Though Singh passed it off as a routine affair, insiders say he expressed his displeasure over certain issues and put forth his views in the meeting with the CM. This one-to-one meeting between the CM and DGP has taken place after a gap of almost a month.

Those named in the panel sent by UPSC were senior IPS officers V K Singh, Vivek Johri and Maithli Sharan Gupt.

In a letter to the UPSC secretary, MP home secretary Rajesh Kumar Jain wrote that Johri (1984 batch) has not given his ‘ willingness ’ for the post of DGP in writing, so naming him in the panel is against the mandate of UPSC’s guidelines for selection.

It is now being said that Johri, is ready to give his willingness. “If he gives his willingness, the panel stands, and DGP would have to be finalized from the same list,” said an officer wishing anonymity. He also said that there is no system of giving willingness in writing. “If there is non-willingness, the officer concerned is supposed to give a letter citing reasons,” he said.

MP home secretary had informed UPSC that their recommendation has been rejected and sought a fresh meeting of the selection committee. “State government will send a new proposal to the commission on the matter at the earliest,” Jain wrote.

However, when the family read the certificate carefully they were shocked as the resident address line mentioned ‘Near Pakistan Railway Station’ as a landmark.Talking to TOI, Shaleha Bibi Pathan said, “After the enactment of CAA and talks of NRC, we are making frantic efforts to get our records in place. Four days ago, we went to the AMC to get the certificate and were shocked by this address. We tried to get it rectified at the civic centre but nobody paid any heed to our pleas. So we rushed to the office of the Danilimda Congress councillor Badruddin Shaikh.”Shaleha fears that mention of ‘Pakistan railway crossing’ in the birth certificate of her grandson may lead to difficulties in getting an aadhaar card or even PAN card. She expressed concern that the child may also be denied admission in a school.Sarfaraz Khan, great grandfather of the child and father of Shaleha said that this is a grave mistake as the references to the area in local parlance has got reflected in the official record.The crossing in the area is informally referred to as ‘Pakistan crossing’ as it is near a Muslim-dominated locality housing around 2,200 families referred as ‘Chhota Pakistan’. The area is officially named ‘Vasant Gajendragadkar Nagar EWS Housing’ named after the state’s first general secretary of the Jan Sangh Party in Gujarat.In Vatva, there are other localities too named after south-east Asian countries. For instance, the neighbouring Sadbhavana Nagar and Khushabahu Thakre Colony which is mostly Hindu-dominated is known as ‘Hindustan’.Shyama Prasad Mukherjee Colony with 992 housing units is nicknamed ‘Sri Lanka’. An EWS cluster has been recently nicknamed ‘Africa’.Activists say that local references getting reflected in official records is a serious lapse and should be rectified.Badruddin Shaikh, who is also former opposition leader in the AMC, said, “This is a criminal offence and the AMC should get the papers for this 18-month-old boy who even does not know what a birth certificate is.”Shaikh has written to the municipal commissioner Vijay Nehra, urging him to get the mistake rectified.Bhavin Joshi, who is in-charge of Registrar of Birth and Death, said, “We have checked the child’s records and found that our official record mentions the same address that was entered in the VS Hospital register. The record show that the father of the child has even signed the register attesting the records. They should have raised objection at that time.”He however, said that the parents have been called on Monday and after verifying their documents, due correction would be made.",ahmedabad,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74038904,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-488066,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/born-in-vatva-at-pak-railway-crossing/articleshow/74035532.cms
406,['9/02/2020'],CM Ashok Gehlot vows to make public welfare-centric budget,"This story is from February 9, 2020

CM Ashok Gehlot

JAIPUR: Chief minister Ashok Gehlot on Saturday said farmers, livestock rearers, dairy associations have a significant contribution to the state’s GDP and economy while adding that the government will prepare a ‘ public welfare-centric budget ’.

Gehlot said the feedback given by voluntary organisations, social workers and civil society have an important role in the implementation of government schemes and policies at grassroot level.

The chief minister was addressing a pre-budget interactive session with voluntary organisations, farmers, consumer forums here. The representatives of the Divyang community also put forward their demands with regard to giving the status of BPL category to their families, as mentioned in the manifesto of the party, and nominate the persons with disability to the post of a parshad and members in the municipal and panchayat bodies.

He said it was an effort of his government to include important suggestions of various social organisations in the preparation of the ‘public welfare budget ’ so that the benefits of the budget can reach every section of the society.

He said the suggestions made by voluntary organisations have been instrumental in formulating laws like Right to Information, Food Security Act and Right to Education. Gehlot said the role of NGOs and social workers is important to maintain harmony in the society.

He said the government realises that even after running various welfare schemes and programmes, there is a lot of scope for optimistic improvement of farmers’ lives.

407,['9/02/2020'],"In Madhya Pradesh, Congress alarmed by BJP’s bid to count tribals as Hindus","This story is from February 9, 2020

Madhya Pradesh chief minister Kamal Nath

BHOPAL: Chief minister Kamal Nath is concerned by reports in sections of media that RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat wants tribal community members to be counted as Hindus in the 2021 census .

Bhagwat was in Bhopal last week for a meeting of Sangh leaders from Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh. Both states have huge tribal populations — MP over 21% and Chhattisgarh nearly 32%. The state BJP insists tribals are the “first and original Hindus”.

“They have been living on this soil for thousands of years. For us, Hindutva is a way of living and tribals are 100% Hindus. They are the first line of Hindus. If you disassociate them, the community becomes soft target for missionaries and conversions,” said state BJP spokesman Hitesh Vajpayee. “By keeping them with a separate identity, Congress is indirectly helping missionaries,” he claimed.

Amid reports that RSS will launch a campaign to persuade tribals to identify themselves as Hindus, sources say, CM Nath has ordered senior officials to keep a watch on RSS activities in the 89 tribal blocks of MP. “CM will never allow anyone to play with the sentiments of tribals,” said PCC media department chairperson Shobha Oza.

“RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat was the person who advocated ending of reservations. RSS, which wants to end reservation for deprived classes, now wants to identify tribals as Hindus. Tribals have a different identity, they have a separate culture. Why does RSS want tribals to be marked as Hindus?” asked Oza.

Law minister P C Sharma said, “RSS claims it is a cultural organization, but its agenda is primarily based on religion and their motive is to divide the nation. BJP does exactly as the Sangh says. In the Constitution, every citizen has the right to expression. RSS cannot make that choice of religion for a citizen.”

Higher education minister Jitu Patwari argued, “For thousands of years, diversity has been the identity of this country. Tribals have a traditional way of living. In the Andamans, the government spends massive amounts of money to ensure that tribals can live their traditional life. The Constitution gives equal rights to everyone. I am a Hindu, so I identify myself as Hindu. If you force someone to identify otherwise, it is a sheer violation of Fundamental Rights.”

State BJP spokesman Rajneesh Agarwal, however, argued, “If Congress party, under pressure from separatists, tries to divide society, it will prove to be dangerous. Provisions under NPR and law is sufficient to conduct the census. Encouraging tribals to give false identity will keep them outside the purview of development.” Leader of opposition Gopal Bhargava went so far as to allege that CM Nath wants tribals to be converted to Christianity on instructions from AICC president Sonia Gandhi.

“CM Nath has threatened action on RSS — an organization that wants to bring tribals of Madhya Pradesh and rest of the country into mainstream Sanatan Dharma. Kamal Nath should first study the background, history and culture of tribals. Tribals have been an integral part of Sanatan Dharma and there is no need to prove it. Lord Rama tasted berries offered by Shabari, a tribal. From Treta Yug to Dwapar Yug, tribals have played a major role. To now say that tribals are not Hindus and threatening action is very unfortunate,” LoP Bhargava said on Saturday.

“There have been instances of playing with sentiments of Hindus before. I know this is happening with instructions from Congress national president Sonia Gandhi and Christians. CM Nath wants to convert tribals to Christianity from Chhindwara onwards. But RSS will never let Congress’ conspiracy succeed,” Bhargava said.

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The state budget has allocated Rs 675 crore for the cash-strapped Kerala water authority ( KWA ).

Hinting at a probable hike of water tariffs, finance minister TM Thomas Isaac said that the gap between cost of production of water and revenue should be reduced. “The average cost of one kilo litre of water is Rs 23.72, but the average price of water is Rs 9.50. A fundamental restructuring is inevitable to bridge this gap,” Isaac said.

He said that the bottled water from KWA will be made commercially available by this financial year. The budget has announced sanctioning of Rs 2 crore for completion of the bottled water project at Aruvikkara. Already, Rs 16 crore has been spent on the project.

The budget has allocated Rs 864 crore for irrigation. The minister said that Rs 1,051 crore has been spent on Muvattupuzha Valley irrigation project, which was commissioned in 1974, with an estimated cost of Rs 21 crore. tnn

File photo

NEW DELHI: A fortnight after making it public that judiciary is exploring use of artificial intelligence to speed up justice delivery, Chief Justice S A Bobde on Saturday said traditional methods of arbitration in India could be augmented by use of AI to achieve international standards.

Speaking at an International Conference on ‘Arbitration in the Era of Globalisation’, organised by Indian Council of Arbitration and FICCI, the CJI said, “As we conceptualise international arbitration in a globalised era, we must also be cognisant of the synergistic opportunities available for international arbitration through utilisation of disruptive technologies.”

“Artificial Intelligence could provide immense benefits for the arbitration process and its users. By augmenting human cognitive abilities, AI powered services could assist lawyers in drafting, identification of better authorities, reviewing documents etc. It is also well placed to assist arbitral tribunals in preparation of award, simultaneous judicial review, streamlining case management etc. AI-based analytics system could be used to predict costs, duration and possible resolution including proposing a range of settlement based on analysis of previous arbitrations of similar size and complexity. AI-assisted arbitration holds immense promise for the arbitration community,” he said.

On January 24, CJI Bobde had said he was looking to employ AI, which reads one million characters per second, in judiciary to help judges get gist of voluminous petitions quickly and propel the pace of case disposal.

With the three-tier justice delivery system crawling under the heavy load of nearly three crore cases, he had said, “The AI systems we are currently looking to employ in courts, possesses reading speed of one million characters per second. I can imagine a system similar to this can be used to read and extract all relevant facts, compute tax effect and assist in a myriads of new ways to propel the pace of decision-making.”

Speaking at the 79th Foundation Day function of Income Tax Appellate Tribunal (ITAT), he had said, “Understanding the nature of the matters decided by the Tribunal, artificial intelligence can play a very significant role in docket management and decision-making.”

On use of AI by other jurisdictions, the CJI said, “I find it reassuring to discover that more nations are taking steps towards experimenting and implementing AI in their respective justice delivery systems. This goes to say that we are doing and must continue to do everything in order to tackle with the workload in judicial process. AI, as I see, brings new hope to drive the public faith in our (judicial) institutions.”

412,['9/02/2020'],VNIT help sought to solve Sadar flyover traffic mess,"This story is from February 9, 2020

Nagpur: The National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) and city traffic police have sought help from Visvesvaraya National Institute of Technology (VNIT) to decongest traffic at the landing of the newly constructed Y-shaped Sadar flyover near Kasturchand Park.

The flyover, which was inaugurated by city MP and Union transport minister Nitin Gadkari on January 9, is causing a bottleneck on the side of its landing between Vidhan Bhavan Square and LIC Square on the busy Wardha-Kamptee Road.

Though traffic police have blocked the road at the flyover’s landing for vehicles coming from Samvidhan Square and moving towards LIC Square by installing barricades, it has increased violations at the flyover. Most two-wheeler riders and autorickshaws can be seen taking a U-turn from the flyover.

Traffic police have also urged the NHAI to extend the existing divider at the landing of the flyover near Kasturchand Park. “Subsequently, we will extend the divider by almost 500 metre,” said a senior NHAI official.

In a joint study conducted by NHAI and traffic police, they had shortlisted two solutions — installing traffic signals at the landing and restricting vehicles going toward LIC Square from Samvidhan Square. No signals have been installed there and instead, traffic police diverted the vehicles from beneath the Sadar flyover. They were either taking the Shriram Towers road or using the Liberty Square road to move towards Kamptee Road.

An NHAI official said during a spot visit, the VNIT team suggested getting more space at the landing of the flyover by acquiring MSEDCL sub-station land near Kasturchand Park. “It will not be feasible as Kasturchand Park metro station is also being constructed there. If we accept this move, it may further add to the chaos,” the official said.

He said that they are also studying MahaMetro’s proposal to treat Kasturchand Park as traffic rotary and declare all the three roads along it as one-way.

413,['9/02/2020'],‘The Shoes’ shines by polishing child poverty before worldSlug: Crushed Childhood,"This story is from February 9, 2020

Nagpur: Contemporary cinema beautifully highlights the emotional and hidden aspect of our society in the shortest time possible and the Roshan Bhondekar-directed short film, ‘ The Shoes ’, which narrates the story of a child in search of happiness, is a fresh example of it.

Bhondekar, a film maker and director who hails from Tumsar, a small town in Maharashtra, made this film in association with Envision Film Studio, a production house. This film has won the prestigious ‘Award of Recognition’ for liberation, social justice and protest from the ‘The Accolade Global Film Competition’.

‘The Shoes’, a three-minute, four-second film, released on June 29, 2019. It has an exceptional storyline. It’s about a child in search of happiness while looking at other children on the streets. The film gives a social message about poverty-ridden children who are deprived of basic needs like food, water, shelter and even a shoe. It brings out the pain of children, who lives miserable lives while growing up.

The film was shot is Madrid (Spain) with child artistes from the same country playing key roles. The societal and emotional content of the film, which struck a chord with the audience, clinched the Accolade Global Film competition award in San Diego (California) on May 29, 2019.

Before its release, the film was screened at various film festivals. It was also broadcast on Spanish TV channels. “It was a life-changing experience for me to shoot a film on child poverty. The prestigious award is a result of immense hard work and teamwork,” said Bhondekar.

“It’s a surreal feeling when people from different parts of the globe appreciate your film. We will keep doing our best to put the best talent on the screen. It’s an honour to share the stage with Oscar-winning production projects,” added Roshan.

The award recognizes the exceptional craft and creativity of media professionals from the world of films, television and videography who produce standout content to bring about a positive change in the society. The entries are judged by noted personalities from the industry. “We never expected this honour to come our way,’ said Roshan.

Alicia Cornide, Valentina Ortiz, Iria Gonzalez, Carla Bote and Adriana Segador are the child artistes from Spain who played different roles in the film which was produced by Sahra Ardah of Spain.

More than the award, Bhondekar wants the film to spread the message of humanity and also to educate the audience about the plight of poor children.

Rick Prickett, who chairs The Accolade Global Film Competition, said, “Winning the award is not an easy task. We receive entries from all over the world, including big production companies and budding talent. The accolade helps set the standard for craft and creativity. The judges were pleased with the exceptional quality of the entries. The aim is to help winners achieve the recognition they deserve,” he added.

Nagpur: Residents of Mohan Nagar and Gaddigodam will meet Naresh Wadetwar, regional officer of National Highways Authority of India (NHAI), on January 11 over Kamptee Road flyover issue.

NHAI has rejected MahaMetro’s revised plan to start the flyover near LIC Square and asked it to start construction in front of SFS Church. The residents strongly oppose this location as they fear for safety of their lives.

The residents led by Father Patrick Lemos of SFS Church met Union transport minister Nitin Gadkari and told him that MahaMetro had started construction opposite the church despite his assurance. Gadkari asked them to meet Wadetwar and Brijesh Dixit, managing director of MahaMetro.

Gadkari had earlier called up Dixit and asked him the reason for not changing the plan. Dixit told him NHAI had rejected the revised plan due to technical reasons.

The initial plan was to start the flyover opposite the church. When locals strongly opposed it and met Gadkari, he asked Dixit to prepare a revised plan. Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) passed a resolution in its general body for acquiring land near the new location.

MahaMetro then submitted a revised plan to NHAI for starting the flyover near LIC Square. Recently, NHAI rejected it without giving any reason.

Wadetwar told TOI that as the earlier design had been approved by technical section of NHAI head office, he had asked MAhaMetro to stick to the initial design. Only modification is that a ramp will be constructed between Kadbi Square and Indora Square, which is expected to reduce the traffic at SFS Church end by 70%.

415,['9/02/2020'],"New cell-blocking kit promises early, better cancer diagnosis","This story is from February 9, 2020

Nagpur: Diagnosing diseases by looking at single cell or small clusters of cells is called cytology or cytopathology. It’s an important part of diagnosing some types of cancers. This was conveyed by a Nagpur-born professor of cytology, Dr Vinod Shidham, who heads the department of cytopathology at Wayne State University School of Medicine and Detroit Medical Center, USA.

He said this while addressing MACyCON 2020, the 3rd annual conference organized by Association of Cytologists of Maharashtra (ACM) at AIIMS, Nagpur, on Saturday.

He has developed a novel method of taking cellblock for cytology which is known as Shidham’s method. He also demonstrated his method of taking cellblock and slide viewing in front of 150 top pathologists from across the country.

He said cytopathology can be a step before biopsy in case of cancer. “Our method addresses most of the issues related to the qualitative and quantitative integrity of final cellblocks. But it needs special skill to perform this in laboratory. We have recently introduced ready-to-use kits. With this kits, this method can be adopted easily in any routine cytology laboratory,” Dr Shidham said.

“Cytology tests are used for both diagnosis and for screening. A diagnostic test is only used for people who have signs, symptoms. Screening test can detect people who might have a certain disease even before they develop symptoms,” he said.

Formal inauguration of the conference is scheduled to be held on Sunday at 9am at AIIMS, Nagpur. Padma Shri Dr Vikas Mahatme will be the chief guest. Under the guidance of AIIMS director Dr VIBHA Dutta, who is also a pathologist, organizing team of Dr Rasika Gadkari, Dr Nisha Meshram Dr Fatema Kamal from AIIMS along with VAPM office-bearers Dr Kishor Deshpande and Dr Manjit Kaur Rajput are coordinating this conference which is first national academic event on the new premises of AIIMS in MIHAN.

….

Better Cell block technique now in Nagpur:

Cell-block is a method of preparing cytological material

It can provide diagnostic information of cancer, thyroid etc

Dr Shidham’s method of taking cellblock addresses most of issues related to qualitative and quantitative integrity.

But performing this method in individual laboratory is labour intensive and relatively non-reproducible due to skill related issues.

So, Dr Shidham has recently introduced ready-to-use kits

These kits allow preparation of qualitatively and quantitatively enhanced cellblocks from any specimen

Kits are available in AIIMS and doctors here were trained in its use on Saturday

416,['9/02/2020'],nCov scare: Chinese restaurants face heat over imported ingredients,"This story is from February 9, 2020

Representative image

MUMBAI: “Are you using made-in-China doubanjiang (a spicy broad bean paste)?” asked a guest before placing an order for Hunan chicken at an East Asian restaurant in a city luxury hotel. The front-line order taker, without batting an eyelid, said no. Before the guest could ask a follow-up question, he said, “All ingredients used in our dishes are made in India or are brought in from Singapore.” The restaurant employee knew where the guest was headed with the question. Since the outbreak of the deadly Novel Coronavirus, which originated in China’s Wuhan region, upscale restaurants serving Chinese food have seen a number of inquiries about the source of their ingredients.

Some restaurateurs also say people are avoiding Chinese cuisine—the most popular foreign fare in India—for fear of getting infected by the virus, which causes a pneumonia-like illness.

Food importers have turned cautious. “People have halted their food shipments from China and are avoiding travelling there. It may have a long-term ripple effect and prices may shoot up in the near future,” said Amit Lohani, founder-director, Forum of Indian Food Importers.

Some Chinese restaurants confirmed they have stopped placing fresh orders for made-in-China products and have started to look for alternative sources. “Lots of ingredients come from China. We buy them through distributors. But all supplies are approved by the food regulator. Right now, we don’t foresee any issues but there will be a crunch in supplies in the coming months. We will have to use alternatives wherever possible and may have to make some dishes unavailable from the menus till supplies resume,” said chef Sharad Dewan, regional director-food production, The Park Hotels, which runs 22 properties in the country.

Chefs at Chinese restaurants, though, ruled out any shortage as “they usually have buffer stocks and there would not be any need for import in immediate weeks”. “Anyway, most of our items are sourced from Thailand and Hong Kong. But we are still checking with suppliers and vendors so that there is no issue in the coming weeks,” said chef Yongliang Wong of Ano Tai, a Chinese restaurant at Jaypee Vasant Continental hotel in New Delhi.

Some are avoiding Chinese, certain restaurateurs admitted. “Due to the hype on media platforms, guests are restricting themselves from visiting Chinese restaurants,” said Wong.

But at another fine-dine outlet in a five-star hotel in Goa, it was business as usual as people had queued up for a taste of chicken in hot garlic sauce and crispy vegetable roll, said its executive chef.

Anjan Chatterjee, chairman and managing director of Speciality Restaurants, echoed the view. “There has been zero impact on business.” Speciality Restaurants owns Mainland China and Asia Kitchen by Mainland China, the largest chain in this segment.

Chatterjee said, “At our restaurants, most products, for instance, noodles, are of Indian make. Only 10% of ingredients, specifically sauces, are imported. But those too are brought in from Singapore, Indonesia and Malaysia. Kwong Cheong Thye and Lee Kum Kee, the brands we use, have manufacturing facilities in these regions.”

A 2019 report by National Restaurant Association of India (NRAI) highlighted that 27% of the respondents surveyed called Chinese their top favourite cuisine after North Indian fare. India’s food service industry, estimated to be Rs 4 lakh crore in fiscal 2019, is expected to reach nearly Rs 6 lakh crore in financial year 2023, NRAI had said.

Mumbai’s executive health officer Dr Padmaja Keskar said as long as food was cooked well and long enough, there can be no risk of infection. “The only problem is with fomites (objects such as clothes and utensils that could carry infection),” she said.

Indonesia plans to ban live animals and certain foods and beverages from China. Many countries, including the UK, are reporting a drop in sales of Chinese food. German Federal Institute for Risk Assessment has said given the virus’s transmission methods, infection from food exported from China is unlikely. Doctors said the fact that WHO has not mentioned Chinese food at all indicates the low risk associated with it.

I’m ready to face the first bullet against the citizenship issue on the lines of ‘Baalidan in Satyagraha’ (sacrificing self to embrace the truth) but my only condition is that the young generation should march along with me. Like many others, I do not have birth-related documents to prove my citizenship. So, am I at fault? The government did not maintain public records. It is their fault.

Q. Is the alleged marginalization of Muslims justified?

A. Not at all. Mohd Ali Jinnah wanted Pakistan, but a sizeable number of people from his community chose India. Whoever is born and brought up here will stay here. This government came into existence a few years ago and now, they want to send the same people who voted for them out of the country. Today, political parties who did not play a role in framing the Constitution are now trying to attain power on the lines of religious ideology. The Constitution clearly states that religion is a personal affair and needs to be safeguarded. But it cannot be a national diktat. This country has humanity flowing in its veins and not religion. The incumbent government is following an outdated ideology which does not fit into any scheme of things in today’s society.

Q. You were also a student activist in the British era. In the recent past, students were targeted in agitations like JNU and Jamia. Do you see any hidden agenda?

A. I was picked up by the British police at the age of 12 when I was urging students of a college in Akola to refrain from pursuing education in English. I was only following a call given by Gandhiji. The police released me before sunset as I was a woman and under-age as well. Under the Constitution, students are free citizens. They are the future citizens who are being mistreated. You must listen to their grievances and try to resolve them and not insult them. A mature government will always have a dialogue with them.

Q. You have been participating in marches and agitations since the 1940s. Do you see any difference in crowd agitations of your time and now?

A. Today, the mob is being misled by some politically and power-hungry parties which should not be the case. This society will agitate against anything which is not acceptable. If the same agitation had been spearheaded by Gandhiji then he would have led it on the lines of ahimsa (non-violence) and charted the course of ‘Satyagraha’. In Satyagraha, it is a fight within oneself rather than the enemy in front of you. The vision is to bring about a change in the heart and mind of the enemy through tolerance and non-violence. In our days, we used to take out ‘Prabhat pheris’.

Q. What is your assessment of the agitation against the Citizenship Act and whether it will last?

A. The current scenario is the third major ‘emergency’ in the country after the British era and Indira Gandhi’s regime. Our society is very mature and potent enough to eject the present government out of power. The situation is gradually moving in that direction. If our lawmakers in legislative bodies are not responding then our citizens must raise the issues on international platforms. This government seems to be bringing back the British era’s ‘divide and rule’ policy. Differences of vision and opinion are needed for peace and balance in the society. Without peace, one cannot expect development.

Q. What is your solution to the agitations in the country against the Citizenship Act?

A. The government must encourage an ‘all-party’ delegation. This body should meet all the aggrieved parties and have a dialogue with them to accommodate their points of view. After that, a debate should take place in Parliament to ensure that the changes suggested by different sections of the society are accommodated. There is no point in insulting protesting groups or sections of the society by labelling them with derogatory expressions like ‘tukde tukde gang’. Talk responsibly and with dignity.

Q. You also had attended a programme to felicitate the police commissioner for his pro-women measures. Do you feel women in today’s society are unsafe?

A. In the past, assaults on women and their dignity took place within the four walls of the house. Today, women are facing a similar situation in the public domain as they are stepping out in more numbers. The onus of women’s security lies with both genders. If a man is targeting a woman, then he must also feel comfortable with someone else doing the same with his family members.

Q. Do you feel today’s women draw undue attention because of their bold and extrovert lifestyle?

A. When the Constitution is guaranteeing equality and equal treatment to all then why think on discriminatory lines. Everyone is trying to avail equal opportunities guaranteed by the Constitution. Why not enjoy just being ‘yourself’ which is more dignified.

418,['9/02/2020'],Helmet for pillion rider to be mandatory in city soon,"This story is from February 9, 2020

Visakhapatnam: Among the measures being taken in the city to reduce road accidents and fatalities in such accidents, the city police are now launching a drive against those riding pillion on two-wheelers. Thus those used to riding pillion helmetless must be aware.

M Ramesh Kumar, ADCP (traffic) said, “We are going to impose traffic violation cases against the rider, if their pillion is not wearing a helmet . In some of the recent road accidents involving two-wheelers, we noticed that pillion riders are worse affected than the riders themselves.”

Other officials of the department informed that in the last 11 accidents involving two-wheelers, six people riding pillion had died and five had suffered serious injuries.

Echoing the sentiment of these officials, Ramesh Kumar asserted, “It is time to take action against pillion riders so that they too use helmets.”

On December 3, 2019 TOI reported that the Visakhapatnam police are planning such a drive. The plan was made after the city’s traffic police, according to its own claim, managed to convince bikers to wear helmets with relative success. The cops are now taking strict action against errant riders riding without helmets.

Discussing how compliance with traffic rules has improved in the Port City in the recent past, a senior traffic police official told TOI, “Even a few months ago, hardly any riders in the city used to wear helmets. But over the last five months, we have started severe drives against riders riding without helmets and are slapping fines on them.”

“The results of the drives have been positive and over 70 per cent riders in the city have started using helmets,” the official added.

On average, around 600 ‘driving without helmet’ cases are lodged in a day. The police had registered 5,55,683 traffic violations in 2018. In 2019, the figure went up to over seven lakh.

Traffic police officials said that they are also trying to rope in the district education wing to create awareness with regard to helmet rules. They said that they have brought up the issue in meetings with the Visakhapatnam road safety committee as well.

“In a recent meeting, we decided that police personnel found riding without helmets will not be allowed to attend to their duty for the day. In was the same meeting where we had decided to take up the issue of pillion riders,” another traffic official informed.

419,['9/02/2020'],Civic body prepares online TDR databank for greater transparency,"This story is from February 9, 2020

Visakhapatnam: The Greater Visakhapatnam Municipal Corporation (GVMC) has started establishing online databank of TDRs (transferable development rights) in a bid to improve transparency in issuing TDRs and helping landowners sell their TDRs.

As per official data, the city’s civic body has issued 2,644 TDRs since 2007 to landowners as compensation for developing roads and other amenities.

As part of the creation of the online TDR databank, the GVMC has already digitally validated around 450 TDRs in the last few days. The process is expected to be completed by February 15.

The databank will contain all the details pertaining to TDRs such as, number of TDRs issued and utilisation of TDRs. Once completed, the portal will also be linked to the Andhra Pradesh Development Permission Management System of the department of municipal administration and urban development.

TDRs are issued by urban local bodies (ULBs) in lieu of the land surrendered by owners or private developers when ULBs are not in a financial position to provide monetary compensation.

The TDR will entitle the owner of the land, in the form of a development rights certificate (DRC), which can used by the owner or be transferred. Essentially, the development rights certificate empowers the DRC holder to go for extra floor space on their residual property or transfer the DRC in the name of another person. The DRC provides the certificate holder the four times the floor space of the area lost.

TDRs are generally issued as compensation for land taken from owners for development of green spaces, playgrounds, water bodies, parking lots, city-level facilities, road widening and drainage systems.

Town planning officials of the GVMC said that the online databank of TDRs will help prevent duplication in sale of TDRs. “We will complete the process over the next week as per the instructions of the state government,” a town planning official said.

420,['9/02/2020'],Understand CAA before reacting: VP,"This story is from February 9, 2020

Visakhapatnam: The Citizenship Amendment Act ( CAA ) does not discriminate between Indian citizens, but seeks to provide citizenship to those who are persecuted on religious grounds in neighbouring countries, Vice-President M Venkaiah Naidu said on Saturday.

“When our people, who are originally Indians, are discriminated, it is our duty to take care of them. There is no mention of discrimination against any Indian citizen in the Act. But unfortunately, a lot of misinformation campaign is being carried out by some vested interests. I appeal to the public to fully study and understand the Act before reacting,” he said during a book release function at Gitam University.

Venkaiah also expressed his concern over the recent happenings in certain legislatures and Parliament with members coming to blows and resorting to acrimonious behaviour. “I am perturbed by the vitriolic language used by members against their opponents. They all should understand that they are only political rivals, not enemies. As the chairman of Rajya Sabha, I often hang my head in shame before the students and others sitting in the gallery during these disturbing sessions,” he said.

Exhorting students to love their mother tongue, he said mother tongue is like our eyes while other languages are like eyeglasses. “Without having eyesight, what is the use of wearing glasses? The foundation of education must be done in one’s mother tongue. But students must learn as many languages as they can,” he said.

Earlier, the Vice-President visited the Eastern Naval Command (ENC) and interacted with navy officials. He also visited the indigenously built stealth frigate INS Sahyadri.

Visakhapatnam: Oakridge International School, Visakhapatnam, has become the first school in Andhra Pradesh to offer International Baccalaureate Diploma Programme (IBDP).

The two-year diploma programme is offered by International Baccalaureate Organisation (IBO) based in Geneva (Switzerland), and is considered a premium and challenging course in the world.

The programme provides an internationally-accepted qualification for entry into higher education and is recognised by many universities across the world.

IBDP is known to develop skills that organisations, such as the World Economic Forum, say are most needed in the coming years — critical thinking, collaboration, cognitive flexibility and complex problem solving.

In India, the Association of Indian Universities, Delhi, recognises IBDP as an entry qualification to all universities, provided the applicant includes a document from the IBO detailing percentage equivalency.

Visitors take a look at terrace garden plants at a 3-day Organic Farm Mela in Visakhapatnam

Visakhapatnam: While efforts are on to make Andhra Pradesh a national leader in zero-budget natural farming ( ZBNF ), ground-level progress shows that online 3 per cent of farmers are practising pesticide-free farming, according to data from the state agriculture department.

According to officials of the state agriculture department, there are nearly 60 lakh farmers in the state with around 80lakh hectares under cultivation. At present, only around 1.6 to 2 lakh farmers in the state are practising ZBNF. Karnataka and Madhya Pradesh seem to be surging ahead in terms of adoption of the practice.

However, during a three-day ‘Organic Farm Mela’ in the city, Sankar Lingala from Rythu Mitra, said in his address that ZBNF has found subscribers in north-coastal Andhra Pradesh, where more people have taken it up than in other districts.

Speaking to TOI, Lingala said, “Awareness among people, efforts by NGOs in encouraging farmers has led to the progress in adoption of natural farming in Visakhapatnam, Vizianagaram and Srikakulam.”

GSNS Leelavathi, joint director of the Visakhapatnam agriculture department said that apart from farmers, consumers too are keen on procuring organic farm-based food nowadays.

“Consumers are ready to purchase organic products despite them being a bit pricey. The government is to achieve ZBNF in the next few years. Nearly 16,000 acres of farmland is under natural farming,” added Leelavathi.

Meawhile, environmentalist JV Ratnam said that since north-coastal Andhra Pradesh has vast tracts of Agency area, the practice of using natural fertilisers like cow dung, vermin compost and such other organic manure is more prevalent here than in other areas.

“Though natural farming may not give good produce initially, in the long run, the farms will yield desired results and improve soil fertility, thereby helping the environment,” Ratnam told TOI.

Visakhapatnam: Retired Bombay High Court Justice Kolse Patil said that CAA and NRC acts are very dangerous to the public of around 50 crore in the country. He said CAA would prove costly to not only Muslims but also Hindus. It would claim Hindus also intruders. He said around 24 crore population in the country do not have Aadhar cards and another 20 are not having birth certificates. So all these people would be in the detention camps.

Addressing the gathering at AP Civil Liberties Committee state meeting held here on Saturday, the Justice said around 19 lakh people of Assam have no identity cards following the implementation of NRC in that state. They were all put in the concentration camps. Out of 19 lakhs, only four lakh are Muslims and 15 lakh are Hindus.

Kolse Patil said that Rs. 20 is the daily income of around 45 crore peoples across the nation. All these people would become not Indians. AU Professor Satyapal, Law College Principal Prof. S Sumitra , Prof. KP Subba Rao and Telangana Civil Liberties Committee leader V Raghunath alleged that if the citizenship faces problems then what about primary rights of the people.

AP Civil Liberties Committee presdeint V Chittibabu and Secretary Chilaka Chandra Sekhar and Telangana committee leader Narayana Rao opposed the CAA and NRC. They said that civil rights activists faced many cases in the past and also facing now. They accused that Osmania University professor Kasim was illegally detained by the cops.

VISAKHAPATNAM: When kernels of corn glimmered like rare jewels, Abhinav Gangumalla and Renu Rao rejoiced. After seven long years, these two farmers practising sustainable farming managed to harvest the glass gem corn which is native to North America at their farm in Hyderabad.

The duo was trying to crack the process since 2013, but has now managed to grow this rare species of corn. Since 2013, the duo was using trial and error to crack the production process of glass gem corn. They have also managed to harvest strawberry corn and purple corn.

Speaking to TOI, Abhinav Gangumalla, who did his BTech in civil engineering from Gitam University in Visakhapatnam , said that he was not happy with the corporate rat-race and therefore he decided to pursue sustainable farming.

Abhinav, who is now also a wellness coach, opened a store called ‘Hyderabad Goes Green’ in 2010. Then, in 2014, his partner Renu Rao and he bought 4.5 acres of land to practice sustainable agriculture.

Their farm— called ‘Beyond Organic’ is known for conserving native seeds and growing new varieties in a seasonal manner. This is where this corn variety was harvested. Stating that all the three varieties of corn were grown in sustainable ways, Abhinav said, “I was just short of tears when I finally saw the glass gem corn because we worked hard for it for seven years. Although we wanted to grow this beautiful corn, we failed consistently.”

“It was grown like normal corn but by using sustainable practices at the farm. After it was harvested, we cooked it and surprisingly, the colour remained,” added Abhinav.

He added that the glass gem corn tasted more authentic and also looked more beautiful with crystals adorning the crop.

Police oversee the 14th day of protest at Morland road in Nagpada

MUMBAI: A group of women sang Hum Honge Kaamyab Ek Din at Mumbai Bagh to protest against NRC-CAA , as others coming to join them were stopped by police on Saturday. Police told the women to sign notices, which few did. Police had filed an FIR against around 300 women sitting in protest on Friday night. The women, leading the protest, stated that they would not call it off till the Union government rolled back NRC.

In the last 14 days, 50 protesters, of which 11 are women, were issued notices under section 149 of CrPC. They stated that police had been telling protesters since January 26 not to continue as no permission was taken. “There could be a law and order problem. Traffic is affected and local residents are facing a problem. If something happens in the law and order situation, you will be held responsible and action will be initiated against you. This notice will be used as evidence against you in court,” the notice read. Police also noted down names and contact numbers of women going to the site.

A police team landed at the Marol residence of activist Feroze Mithiborwala and issued a copy of the notice to him too on Saturday morning. He said BMC was known for doing work slowly, and all of a sudden, it wanted to carry out work on that road.

Nagpada police had on Friday booked 300 women under section 341 (punishment for wrongful restraint) of IPC, sections of Criminal Amendment Act and BMC Act. BMC assistant commissioner Alka Sasaane, who lodged the complaint, said road construction was being done but due to the protest, there were obstacles in completing it. There were traffic issues and women seated on chairs have blocked the road, she said. Sections 313 and 314 of Mumbai Municipal Corporation Act, 1888, were invoked against the women. Section 313 states that no person shall, except with written permission of the commissioner, place upon any public place any chair, bench, box or other thing so as to form an encroachment, while section 314 gives power to remove it without notice.

BMC has undertaken concretization of roads and local corporator Rais Shaikh alleged it was ahead of time. BMC takes up major road repairs post-monsoon, and it is done till the next monsoon. During the four monsoon months, road work is put on hold.

“BMC lodged a complaint under police pressure. The road where women are protesting was constructed and only footpath work is left. I condemn this move by BMC, as road work in the area is ahead of time,” said Shaikh. Sasane did not respond to calls.

Representative image

NEW DELHI: Countering the Centre’s stand on denying command posts to women in the Army on the ground of their physiological limitations and prevailing societal norms, the women officers have told the Supreme Court that it reflected a regressive mindset of the government , which will perpetuate gender discrimination.

Senior advocate Aishwarya Bhati, counsel for women officers seeking permanent commission and command posting in Army, said the Centre’s contentions are contrary to the records and statistics which show women officers have worked shoulder to shoulder with their male colleagues and performed extremely well- both in peace locations as well as hostile zones.

In a written note filed in the apex court on Friday, Bhati contended that the stand taken by the Centre was unfortunate and to deny command appointments to women officers would be an extremely retrograde step and pleaded the court to intervene to uphold the sacrosanct principles of gender equality as enshrined in the Constitution.

The Centre had cited male troops not yet being mentally conditioned to accept women officers in command units, greater family demands of women and dangers of them being taken prisoners of war as some of reasons to assert that women officers may not be suitable for command posts in the Army.

Questioning the government’s stand, Bhati said, “Indian Air Force and Indian Navy, having adopted the policy of complete equality for grant of permanent commission to women officers, it is extremely unfortunate that reasons of women lacking on various counts, prevailing societal norms and lack of combat exposure etc are being cited as lame excuses. It is submitted that women have been working shoulder to shoulder, with their colleagues in the Army. Even as SSC officers, they have been working as company commanders and leading soldiers from the front as per the ethos of the Army.”

“As young officers in the rank of Captain and Major, they have been in hostile and combat zone and displayed exemplary courage and bravery, acting exactly in the manner commensurate with the respect that the Indian Army commands, world over. To deny them command appointments would be an extremely retrograde step and will inflict irreparable injury to the dignity of these brave women,” she said in her note.

She said the Centre’s stand is contrary to the demonstrated fact that women officers have been serving in the 10 combat support arms for the last 27-28 years and have proven their mettle and courage under fire. “They have been found suitable by the organisation itself and have led platoons and companies of soldiers and men, both in peace locations as also hostile locations/operations, in the 10 Combat Support Arms. There has never been any occasion of soldiers/men having refused or not accepted the command of women on account of their perceived rural background, with prevailing societal norms,” she said.

The officers described as “misleading” the Centre raising the issues of national security, battlefield scenario, capture by enemy as the matter is not about allowing women officers to work in combat role.

Bhati also gave a list of decorated women officers, who showed exemplary courage in armed forces, to buttress her point that women are second to none in discharging their duty.

List of decorated women officers

1-Maj Mitali Madhumita—First lady officer to receive Sena Medal for showing exemplary courage during terrorist attack on Indian embassy in Kabul when she was posted as a leader of English language training team.

2 Sq Ldr Minty Agarwal—A fighter controller with IAF, she was part of team that guided Wing Commander Abhinandan to shoot down a Pakistani F-16 during air skirmishes post Balakot airstrike. She was awarded Yudh Seva Medal.

The central government’s affidavit in Madras HC , in response to a habeas corpus petition filed by India’s longest serving woman prisoner, Nalini Sriharan, on Friday said it is the governor who shall take an appropriate decision on the matter. It even said the fate of convict A G Perarivalan’s mercy petition, pending before Purohit, too hinged on the governor’s “discretion”.

There are only three routes to clemency — by the President under Article 72 of the Constitution, by the governor under Article 161, and by the state government under Section 435 of CrPC.

The President has already rejected clemency multiple times and Tamil Nadu government’s bid to invoke 435 CrPC bombed after the Centre moved SC and got an order stating that “consultation” in respect of a case probed by central agencies would mean “concurrence”.

The Centre has rejected Tamil Nadu government’s early release proposal. It left only Article 161 available to the governor. Bitten once, the Tamil Nadu government adopted the Article 161 route on September 9, 2018 and recommended to the governor, who is sitting on it for more than 18 months.

NAVI MUMBAI: Seven firemen, including two fire officers, sustained burn injuries during fire-fighting operations at a Nerul highrise after a major fire broke out in a duplex flat on the 20th and 21st floors, around 6.30am on Saturday. The incident occurred at Sea Homes Tower in Sector 44 of Seawoods in Nerul.The injured include assistant sub-fire officers G B Gade and V D Koli, leading fireman J D Joshi and firemen T J Thakare, M T Pawar, D M Jawale and J B Bhoye. They were injured after an LPG cylinder and air-conditioner compressor exploded in the 20th floor apartment, where the fire started in the electrical panel due to a short-circuit, Nerul fire officer Arun Bhoir said.The duplex owner, Chandrakant Bhansali (63), a builder, who is also the society’s chairman, and his five family members, including minors, quickly left the apartment. As the Bhansalis alerted others in the society, by ringing the fire alarm bell, residents too rushed downstairs. The blasts came after the duplex got engulfed in flames around 7.30am.Dr Sunil Keswani of National Burns Centre, Airoli, said, “All seven have sustained less than 20% burn injuries, which are patchy burns. Hence, there is nothing to worry as their vital signs are normal. But the depth of burns cannot be known on day one of treatment. Three of them are in the ICU, and the others are in the male ward.”Bhoir said, “Twenty fire engines, water browsers and mini-tenders from Vashi, Kopar Khairane, Nerul, CBD and Airoli, apart from the 68-foot Bronto Skylift from Vashi were pressed into service. As the fire hydrant system of the tower was not operational, we had to take water from the underground tank of a building on the opposite side. Water was filled in the fire engine, which was connected to the Bronto Skylift for fire-fighting operations. It took around eight hours to extinguish the fire in the five-room duplex.”Duplex owner Chandrakant Bhansali said, “I was in the kitchen with my wife when suddenly there was a power failure. Due to the smoke, water sprinklers in the flat got activated. Our family members ran out of the apartment and went downstairs.”In Video: Navi Mumbai: 5 firemen injured while battling highrise blaze",navi-mumbai,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74037657,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-463901,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/navi-mumbai/7-firemen-suffer-burn-injuries-in-blasts-after-seawoods-tower-blaze/articleshow/74037655.cms
432,['9/02/2020'],Ex-CEC: VVPAT has made poll process transparent,"This story is from February 9, 2020

NAGPUR: The process of holding free and fair elections in India has evolved over a period of time with ballet papers being replaced first by electronic voting machines (EVMs) and later by voter-verified paper audit trail ( VVPAT ) which is foolproof, said former chief elections commissioner ( CEC ) OP Rawat on Friday.

Delivering a speech on ‘India’s elections and electoral reforms’, organized by Maharashtra National Law University, Nagpur, he said VVPAT has transformed the process as voters can see for which candidate they have voted. The voting machines at poll booths are immediately replaced if there are reports of malfunctioning, he added.

Commenting on the repeated complaints of candidates exceeding the limit of expenditure as stipulated by the Election Commission, he said most of the political parties spend crores of rupees from the funds they get. In such a situation, it is very difficult to prove charges of over-expenditure by candidates in gross violation of rules, he added.

“Political parties have been increasingly using social media platforms for electioneering and there is no effective mechanism to curb such practices. This also saves money parties spend on campaigning,” he said. Short films and street plays are the other modes the political parties have adopted for election drive which does not require much money, he added.

Rawat lauded former CEC TN Seshan for ushering in electoral reforms and said he was the first bureaucrat who showed that the Election Commission has tremendous powers to curb illegal means political parties take recourse to.

It was during his regime the poll panel was feared by those using illegal means during elections. Seshan’s successors continued the high standards set by him to ensure transparency during elections, Rawat added.

It is very difficult to prove that a particular news is paid. This makes it difficult for the EC to calculate the exact expenditure by a candidate during campaigning. He also briefly spoke on the plans made by the EC to link ‘Aadhaar’ with election I-cards.

Rawat had an interactive session with the faculty and students in which he replied to various questions raised by them as regards the poll process, how the EC functions and many more.

The first case of coronavirus was detected in TAR in January. Since then, several cases have been confirmed from the Region.While restrictions have still not been imposed on trade across the Nathu La Pass in north Sikkim, the situation is being monitored closely, an official said. Indian troops are also posted along the LAC with China and the situation is being studied.“Russia has sealed its border with China. However, Wuhan is several thousands of kilometeres away from Lhasa. We should not jump to any conclusions and take drastic steps. If we get information of any serious problem in TAR, necessary steps will be taken. Our troops along the LAC are our primary concern. If necessary, they will be allotted protective equipment and an advisory will be released on how they should interact with their counterparts from across the LAC. There are routine Border Personnel Meetings with the People’s Liberation Army. The situation has improved along the LAC and we don’t want to raise an unnecessary scare,” an official said.Indian soldiers come in direct contact with their counterparts from China even during routine patrols.Trade with China along the historic Silk Route (through Nathu La) suffered in 2019 after the Doklam stand-off. Traders are worried that the coronavirus scare may affect trade in the days to come. There is also considerable concern regarding the Kailash Manasarov Yatra for 2020.While there are tours operated through Kathmandu in Nepal, the Chinese government had recently opened a route through Nathu La that is faster. India also promotes this route. Officials are worried that if the situation in China escalates, it may have an impact on the Yatra.“People have already started booking for the Yatra. We are worried of a situation where the situation in China gets worse and the Yatra has to be called off. We don’t want this to happen. People will be extremely disappointed but we can’t allow them to risk getting exposed to the virus. That is another reason why we are keeping a close watch on the situation.

435,['9/02/2020'],CID questions Ranaghat MP over MLA murder,"This story is from February 9, 2020

Kolkata: CID questioned Ranaghat’s BJP MP Jagannath Sarkar on Saturday about Krishnaganj MLA Satyajit Biswas’s murder last February.

This comes days after the Calcutta High Court granted Sarkar anticipatory bail till February 28. A division bench of justices Joymalya Bagchi and Suvra Ghosh, however, directed him to meet the investigating officer and fixed February 18 for final hearing of his case.

The Trinamool Congress MLA was killed amid murmurs that local BJP leaders had plotted his murder.

CID sources said Sarkar was questioned for around four hours and mostly “cooperated”. He was asked about whether he had links with the accused, his knowledge of the incident and whether his statements matched those of the others. Sarkar later said he had always complied with CID directives. “I will cooperate with the investigation in whatever capacity,” he said.

The victim’s family had lodged an FIR accusing 43 people. In the supplementary FIR, BJP leader Mukul Roy and Sarkar were included in the accused list and investigators had charged them with masterminding the crime. However, in the initial charge sheet filed by the investigators, their names were not included as the probe found inadequate evidence. But CID moved a plea before a Ranaghat court a few weeks later seeking permission to initiate a fresh investigation against them.

The investigators informed the court that after seizing the mobile phone of one accused, his conversations with Roy and Sarkar had been recovered, which is why fresh investigation against the duo was required. The Ranaghat court restrained the investigators from including their names in the charge sheet but let them continue the probe against the duo.

Apprehending arrest because of the fresh probe, Roy and Sarkar moved an anticipatory bail before the HC. The same division bench had earlier issued an interim order asking police not to arrest Roy at least till April and directed investigators to complete the probe by March.

437,['9/02/2020'],"Kolkata: Books on CAA, NRC fly off the shelves","This story is from February 9, 2020

One of the books on the issue at the book fair.

KOLKATA: Niche publications that print books on current affairs and little magazines that usually struggle to survive are making the most of the spike in interest on the new citizenship law, the National Register of Citizens and National Population Register fuelled by the ongoing nationwide protests. Nearly all the publications have come out with issues focusing on these topics in December and January and these are flying off the shelves at the Kolkata book fair and at stores across the city.

The demand started picking up after the passage of the Citizenship (Amendment) Act ( CAA ) in Parliament on Dec-ember 11 and books and little magazines on these subjects have far outpaced those on other current affair topics.

Almost all the titles are priced between Rs 15 and Rs 50.

When all five copies of ‘The Saga of Assam’s National Reg-ister of Citizens ( NRC )’, a book that had been gathering dust on a shelf at Parchment Books in Kalighat for months, got sold within 48 hours of the passage of the CAA, the seller called the publisher to order more. But even the publisher had run out of copies.

“The interest on CAA, NRC, and NPR is so high that all the books that I had stocked, both in favour of CAA and against, got sold out,” said Phalguni Ghosh of Parchment Books.

At Dhyanbindu, a bookstore near College Square known for its rare titles on literature, art, music and politics, buyers are turning up even from the districts to pick up books on NRC, NPR and CAA.

“Books on these topics are moving rapidly off the shelves. People are also buying books on Kashmir, refugee politics and migration along with those on Syama Prasad Mukherjee and RSS,” said owner Subrata Sarkar. He added that all copies of a book on NRC in Assam got sold off in no time.

The scene is similar at Manik book stall and Big Byang café in Jadavpur, Sunilda’s book stall in Ultadanga, Read Bengali book store in Lake Market and Patiram in College Street.

People’s Study Circle, publisher of ‘The Saga of Assam’s National Register of Citizens (NRC)’, which has been the hottest selling book on the issue so far, has also come out with booklets on NRC, NPR, migration issues, refugee politics and the role of RSS in India’s Independence.

“The book on Assam NRC was our first and so far we have sold around 5,000 copies. Such was the response that we translated the book into English and Assamese. These too sold like hot cakes,” said Kasturi Bose, q senior member of People’s Study Circle. Another recent publication, ‘Nijer Deshe Refugee Hobo?’, a compilation of frequently asked questions on NRC, NPR and CAA, is on the verge of getting sold out.

“Affordability is a key criteria as the idea is to reach out to as many people as possible. These are issues that will create difficulties for ordinary people. So people are raising their voice nationwide. This has helped in the sale of the booklets which were published as a mass awareness tool,” said Dwaipayan Banerjee, another member of the publishing house.

Banking on the high interest, a number of book stalls at the Kolkata book fair have stocked up on these books. The December issue of several little magazines also focus on NRC and NPR.

“Little magazines like Aneek, Ekush Shatak have come up with writings on NRC and NPR in their December issue and they were a huge hit. Within 15 days, the first set of all these magazines (over 500 copies) were sold,” said Tapas Bhattacharya, owner of Patiram.

Bookstore owners said besides their regular customers, mostly students and researchers are buying these books.

The meeting took place at Jhargram Rajbari. Chatterjee was in Jhargram to inaugurate Jhumur Utsav.

Mahato said: “We discussed the situation in Jangalmahal and the condition of the area and its people in the past. Jangalmahal has changed completely. Thanks to CM Mamata Banerjee, the tribal belt has witnessed a development spree. I myself can’t recognise many areas of Jangalmahal.”

Asked if he was considering joining Trinamool, Mahato said, “I have just got out of jail. I have not decided, but I will not sit idle.”

Chatterjee said: “He is an old friend. I called him for a meeting.” Asked if TMC wou-ld invite him to join the party, he added: “Let him get organised. He should be given time to decide on this. Ours (TMC’s) is a large family just as his is.”

BENGALURU: A speeding car ploughed into a traffic police team on Kempegowda International Airport Road on Saturday evening, killing a head constable and seriously injuring another.The impact was so severe that the two constables, Dhananjaya Y and Uma Maheshwar, from the Chikkajala traffic wing, were thrown towards the metal railing on the side of the road. They were rushed to a nearby hospital, but there was nothing doctors could do to help Dhananjaya, 40. He was declared brought dead. Uma was later shifted to a private hospital; his condition is said to be serious.The errant motorist, Kushal Raj M, who was headed to the airport in a white Hyundai i10, has been arrested. Police said tests had revealed that he was not driving under the influence, but he was travelling at a very high speed. Raj is a textile merchant from Gavipuram, Basavanagudi.The accident occurred around 5:30pm. Dhananjaya and Uma were attached to a speed interceptor vehicle, which was stationed near Chikkajala flyover, cracking down on airport-bound motorists driving too fast.Witnesses said the traffic team had stopped a few cars and was issuing challans when Raj's i10 appeared on the scene. The speeding car smashed into a stationary four-wheeler on the left side of the road before hitting the two constables.""The i10 was being driven at a great speed. I don't think the driver spotted police personnel standing on the side of the road,"" said Vivek, who witnessed the accident. ""Everything happened in a matter of seconds. It would have been a bigger tragedy had the car been in the right lane.""Another passerby, Bheemappa, said the constables had no time to move away from the oncoming vehicle's path.

No one should put lives at risk this way just to avoid a fine,"" he said.Police said Raj was in a rush as he had to catch a 7.10pm flight to Mumbai. Some people, in fact, were alarmed by the way he was driving.""I noticed the vehicle when it went past my cab; it was jumping lanes and speeding. I was discussing how dangerous this was with the cab driver when the speeding car hit another vehicle and some police personnel,"" said Sandeep Sharma, who alerted traffic police about the accident on Twitter.Dhananjaya is survived by his wife Anusuyamma, who is a constable in Yelahanka New Town police station.

BEIJING: Communist leaders are trying to keep food flowing to crowded cities despite antidisease controls and to quell fears of possible shortages and price spikes following panic buying after most access to Wuhan was cut off January 23.

Food stocks in supermarkets ran low shortly after Beijing imposed travel curbs and extended the Lunar New Year holiday to keep factories, offices and other businesses closed and the public at home in an attempt to prevent the virus from spreading. That also kept trucks off the road, disrupting supplies of food.

This week, a cabinet official acknowledged vegetable supplies were uneven and some “daily necessities” were sold out. “These problems are being coordinated and resolved,” Lian Weiliang, deputy chairman of the National Development and Reform Commission, said on February 3.

Later that day, state TV announced the ruling Communist Party order local authorities nationwide to “ensure the supply of daily necessities”, including vegetables, meat, eggs, milk and grain. The following day, the agriculture ministry told officials to unblock transportation and “ensure normal operation” of livestock and feed production.

In Nanjing, a grocery store employee said, “Some people tried to buy a lot, but they are no longer doing it after seeing the abundant supply.“

Representative image

BENGALURU: The city’s longpending demand for suburban rail is unlikely to be fulfilled in the near future with Karnataka Rail Infrastructure Development Enterprises (K-RIDE), the special purpose vehicle mandated to execute the Rs 18,600 crore project, saying it requires at least Rs 1,400 crore to get the project started.

The development comes at a time when the Centre has made a paltry allocation of Rs 1 crore for the project this year. While K-RIDE said it’s in talks with financial institutions to fund the project, the railway ministry maintained there will be no delay. “We propose to invest 5% of the construction cost and 50% of the land cost in the first financial year (2020-21), which is around Rs 1,400 crore, for the project to take off,” said K-RIDE managing director Amit Garg on Saturday.

The project is funded 20% each by the state and Centre and 60% through external loans. It remains to be seen what amount that will be allocated in the state budget. Garg said they are in talks with financial institutions like World Bank, ADB, JICA, AIIB and Korea Eximbank (KEXIM).

Meanwhile, minister of state for railways Suresh Angadi said the project will not be delayed, but refused to provide a time frame.

Asked about the delay in getting clearance from the Cabinet Committee of Economic Affairs for the project that was announced in 2018-19 budget, he said, “Karnataka had a coalition government at that time. The Rs 1 crore allocated in the Pink Book is a token amount...The Karnataka CM has assured that a significant amount will be allocated in the state budget.”

LONDON: A UK woman who as a teenager ran away to join the Islamic State terror group lost a legal challenge on Friday aimed at restoring her citizenship, which was revoked on national security grounds.

Shamima Begum, who went to Syria in 2015 to join IS, resurfaced at a refugee camp in Syria last year and said she wanted to come home. Former home secretary Sajid Javid revoked her citizenship, but she challenged the decision.

She said she wasn’t the citizen of another country and the decision left her stateless. But the tribunal ruled in Javid’s favour. Judge Doron Blum said the decision didn’t breach the home office’s “extraterritorial human rights policy” and that she was “a citizen of Bangladesh by descent”, and therefore not rendered stateless.
