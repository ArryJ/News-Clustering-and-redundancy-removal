0,['15/02/2020'],Music Review: Naan Sirithal,"Hiphop TamizhaThe album of Raana’s romantic comedy Naan Sirithal has a line-up of six songs, all of which clock around crisp three minutes. Breakup Song by Hiphop Tamizha is a fast-paced number, which is quite self-explanatory thanks to its title. The song, which begins with the screeching noise of a conch, sets the tone for the song. While the lyrics seem quite redundant, the song is backed by interesting instruments.Dhom Dhom is a breezy number rendered by Sanjith Hegde and Hiphop Tamizha. Sanjith adds a charming presence to this otherwise normal song. Anjukku Gumukku, rendered by Hip Hop Tamizha, fails to make a mark, save for the catchy interludes. Naan Siricha by Kaushik Krish and Gana Vinoth is a fun addition to the line-up, which explains the perplexities of laughing at inappropriate moments, a condition that the protagonist goes through. The song is elevated by upbeat, conversational humour in its lyrics.Happy Birthday, rendered by Diwakar and Ka Ka Balachander, falls a bit flat, sounding a bit too familiar to Hiphop Tamizha’s earlier work. Keka Beka by Rajan Chelliah and Hiphop Tamizha, depicts the downsides of constant ‘nervous laughter’, which is quite hummable.",entertainment,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74134981,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-1002133/74134981.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/tamil/music/music-review-naan-sirithal/articleshow/74134981.cms
1,['15/02/2020'],How a Kannada song for Popcorn Monkey Tiger ended up with English lyrics,"If you have not heard the song Maadeva yet, you have to work on staying updated on the Kannada music scene. For here is a number, put together by lyricist Ritwik Kaikini , composer Charan Raj , singer Sanjith Hegde along with rapper HanuManKind , for the soon-to-be-released Dhananjaya-starrer Popcorn Monkey Tiger , that is soaring up the charts. What’s seems to be working for this number is the fact that the lyrics are mostly in English, as aspect that is not only breaking a stereotype, but is also connected with a new generation of music lovers. The team tells us what went into the making of this track…The idea was to write something based on Dhananjaya’s character, his struggles, decisions and his choices. Suri’s vision for the characters in the film and Charan Raj’s thought process of blending different worlds of music seamlessly were influential in the making of the lyrics. As for using English lyrics in a Kannada film, we hoped to be able to attract the new age audience to the Kannada film industry. We wanted the song to reach out to a wider audience and not just limit it to people in Karnataka. We aimed at breaking the stereotype and transcending genres. Our audience has been growing wiser each year and they deserve something that the can relate to.When you work with people like Suri (the director of Popcorn, Monkey, Tiger) who give you the freedom and space to work, it allows us composers the opportunity to experiment. The decision of using English vocals on this number was rather organic. For Maadeva, we worked according to the visuals, and when Suri reviewed what we had done, he said this was exactly what he was looking for. Now with the song doing well among listeners, it feels great to see our work being appreciated.I’m primarily an English rapper. So, for me, to come up with lyrics and to rap for a Kannada song was a completely new experience. While at the studio, with Charan Raj and Sanjith Hegde, I think it was the mood and the vibe at that point that seamlessly translated into words. I came up with the lyrics after I watched the trailer, and based on what Charan told me. I wanted to balance the concept and the mass appeal in the song. For me, it was about putting myself into a different pair of shoes and I wrote for the character.I look up to Charan. He’s like my elder brother and he pushes my boundaries. I was skeptical about singing this song in English. But Charan wanted the sound to be very raw. He wanted me to be myself. I just sang what Ritwik had penned. At that time, this song was not even called Maadeva. It was just something called Wah Wah Wah. It was renamed as Maadeva by Charan. Later, after HanuManKind came on board, we recorded the song together and the rest, as they say, is History.Watch the song here",entertainment,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74136503,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-75684/74136503.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/kannada/movies/news/how-a-kannada-song-for-popcorn-monkey-tiger-ended-up-with-english-lyrics/articleshow/74137283.cms
2,['15/02/2020'],"Shivaji Surathkal wouldn’t exist without Ramesh Aravind, says Akash Srivatsa","Every time director Akash Srivatsa talks about actor-filmmaker Ramesh Aravind , the fanboy in him rears his head. In the years since he first assisted Ramesh on the latter’s directorial — Accident, Vatsa, as he is popularly known, has maintained a close relationship with his ‘mentor’. He has also often turned to Ramesh for guidance, while also harbouring a dream of directing the actor one day. While that didn’t work out for his directorial debut, Badmash, Vatsa has finally realised his dreams by getting Ramesh to play the title character in his next, Shivaji Surathkal . Incidentally, this has also turned out to be milestone of sorts for Ramesh too, as this is his 101st film , which comes after a gap of nearly three years.The film is special to Vatsa on many levels. “When I was planning my next movie, my co-writer Abhinandan YR told me a one-line murder mystery subject that I found quite intriguing. As has been practice, I told Ramesh sir about it and his interest was also piqued. So, we set out to develop it into a full-fledged script. Both Ramesh sir and I are fans of the detective thriller genre, especially the Sherlock Holmes series, so, Abhi and I thought that we could spin the story on similar lines. The film is our tribute to the genre and Sherlock Holmes. We first called it Ranagiri Rahasya, and the protagonist here was named Shivaji. We ran the script by Ramesh sir at various stages and he would dissect it, not as an actor or filmmaker, but as a member of the movie-watching audience, and give us valuable feedback to avoid flaws. He also mentioned that like all popular detectives, Hercule Poirot, Sherlock Holmes or Byomkesh Bakshi, for that matter, had a first and second name. Surathkal is a place that always fascinated me, as back in my college days, it was considered that only the really smart ones manage to get into colleges there. It was a matter of prestige. So, I thought it was apt to call our protagonist, Shivaji Surathkal,” explains Vatsa.Given his inspiration, one wonders if Shivaji Surathkal has been written as a genius with personal flaws, like Holmes and Poirot. “Shivaji sure has his own issues, but they are very different. He battles insomnia, is emotional and angry and is then tasked with finding out who killed a minister’s son in 48 hours. It’s a complicated and bizarre case that brings him to Ranagiri, a place that has a lot of myths surrounding it. Into that midst comes a rational detective, who is looking for clues and evidence to put his case together,” adds the filmmaker.Once the script was in place, Ramesh, says Vatsa, became a director’s actor. “Whatever creative inputs he had until then, ceased. Truth be told, on the first day on set, I was scared about having to call out action and cut to a man I revere. There is a fanboy in me. But in no time, he put me at ease, and showed just how non-interfering he would be. The only pressure I ever felt was during scripting, which took at least a year, as I knew that we needed a different approach to seeing Ramesh sir onscreen in his 101st film,” says Vatsa. Ranagiri Rahasya is only the first in what the director hopes will be a franchise. “The fun fact is that if Ramesh sir had not agreed to be part of the film, I would not have made it, instead trying something else. Shivaji Suratkal and his mysteries are only for Ramesh sir,” Vatsa signs off.",entertainment,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74135987,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-266936/74135987.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/kannada/movies/news/shivaji-surathkal-wouldnt-exist-without-ramesh-aravind-says-akash-srivatsa/articleshow/74135987.cms

The first look of the film, titled Bagheera , was released yesterday, which has Prabhudeva in a wacky appearance.The poster has the actor-choreographer-director in a tonsured look, wearing sunglasses that reflect three images — an image from The Jungle Book, 11:11 and a car. “All the three images have a connect to the story. Bagheera is a character that I loved from The Jungle Book. He is more like a mentor-protector, but can also destroy. Prabhudeva master’s character is similar to this.”The film happens to be Prabhudeva’s 55th film, informs the director. We have seen him romance, dance and do fantastic comedy. But this role will be different from all that he has done before. As a matter of fact, this genre is completely different for me, too.

It was the beginning of 2002… I heard Shankar sir was looking to cast youngsters in his next film and was also auditioning several newcomers. One day, his team had come to the dance institute and taped a whole sequence that we had done. Shankar sir had seen that and thought I had performed well. He then called me and one of the first things he told me was, ‘You look peculiar when you dance’.I guess that worked for me and I gave my audition. A few rounds later, I was finally cast in Boys . Camera was new to me and it was a surreal experience. The first-ever time that KV Anand sir (one of the film’s cinematographers) saw me through the camera was for a small sequence in which I had to walk along the beach, humming a line. Shankar sir had a beach house on ECR and we were shooting there. Anand sir was using an Aari 435 camera.Technically speaking, that was my first experience in front of the camera. The first shot I gave for the film was also my introduction scene of sorts. It was also the first shot of Boys I think.

AURANGABAD: People wanting to agitate in a peaceful way ""cannot be called traitors, anti-nationals only because they want to oppose one law"", the Aurangabad bench of the Bombay high court has said in an order on Thursday on a petition challenging denial of police permission to an agitation against the CAA.""The submissions made show that there will be no question of disobedience of provisions of CAA by such agitation. Thus, this court is expected to consider the right of such persons to start agitation in a peaceful way. This court wants to express that such persons cannot be called as traitors, anti-nationals only because they want to oppose one law. It will be an act of protest only against the government for the reason of CAA,"" the bench said.The bench quashed and set aside two orders passed by the additional district magistrate (ADM) of Beed district and the Majalgaon city police in Beed. The police had cited the ADM's order as the basis for refusal of permission.“India got freedom due to agitations which were non-violent and this path of non-violence is followed by the people of this country till this date. We are fortunate that most of the people of this country still believe in non-violence,” the bench said.In the present matter also the petitioners and companions want to agitate peacefully to show their protest,"" the bench said. ""In the British period our ancestors fought for freedom and also for human rights and due to the philosophy behind the agitations, we created our Constitution. It can be said that it is unfortunate but the people are required to agitate against their own government now but only on that ground the agitation cannot be suppressed,"" the bench added.It further said, ""In such matters, the court needs to consider whether fundamental rights of citizens are breached by the order under challenge.""The ADM's order had cited the Beed superintendent of police's report apprehending deterioration in the law-and-order situation on account of agitations for various reasons, such as damage to crops due to excess rain, price rise of essential commodities, social protection demanded by various communities, and the protest against CAA. Petitioner Iftekhar Zakee Shaikh had challenged police's refusal of permission for peaceful protests against CAA and NRC at the old Idgah Maidan at Majalgaon for an indefinite period between 6pm and 10pm.""It can be said that though the (ADM's) order on face appears to be against everybody, in reality the order is against persons who want to agitate, to protest against CAA. At present such agitations are going on everywhere and there was no whisper of agitations of other nature in this region. Thus, it can be said that there was no fairness and the order was not made honestly,"" the bench said.",india,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74143476,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-136751,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/peaceful-caa-opposers-not-traitors-anti-nationals-hc/articleshow/74143340.cms

What triggered this move was the news that their hit track ' Dus Bahane ' was being recreated for 'Baaghi 3'. That’s when the duo decided to be proactive; they intervened in the project and recreated the 15-year-old dance number themselves.Talking about it, Vishal said, “This is the first time we have recreated our own song. We did it because a lot of the new remixes are just substandard quickie jobs, which have been done on low budgets, by people looking to make a quick buck or to add their name to an already successful product. We didn’t want that to happen to songs that we have created in the past. 'Dus Bahane 2.0' still sounds fresher than a lot of the music being made now. We didn’t want it to be given the chop-shop treatment that usual remixes sound like. We wouldn't want anyone else to remix our songs.”Vishal, however, maintained that recreations can never be better than the original, “As the saying goes, ‘Baap baap hota hai’. The idea was to just refresh the song, with a strong hint of nostalgia, and a beat that makes you dance. What we did was to try and keep the essence of the original intact, and since it’s our song, to have a little fun with it.”Working on the recreation was a challenge for the composers because the song had already been shot and they had to match their composition with it.Shekhar explained, “The tempo was faster than we would have liked, but we had to keep that because it had already been shot. So, we started from scratch and made a track that fit Tiger Shroff ’s vibe and Shraddha Kapoor ’s moves.”The duo retained the original voices of Shaan, KK, their own and added female vocals of Tulsi Kumar Working on their own chart buster was a rush of memories for the duo. “While working on it, we sent a lot of love to our dear friends Anubhav Sinha (Director, Dus), Abhishek Bachchan, Sanjay Dutt Sir and Zayed Khan who are all long-time friends, and the guys whose swag matched the song,” states Shekhar.“This particular instance will also define the future of how songs are respectfully and correctly re-used with the consent of and full credit to the original creators. I hope it is a breakthrough for not just this film and crew, but for the entire industry,” signed off Vishal.",entertainment,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74132496,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-89584/74132496.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/hindi/music/news/vishal-shekhar-excited-to-remix-their-own-song-for-the-first-time/articleshow/74132496.cms

18,['15/02/2020'],Bhagyashree: No one held my hand and said they will launch me in Bollywood: Abhimanyu Dassani,"Abhimanyu Dassani (BCCL/ Aditya Yadav)

How was Lucknow, how did it treat you

Abhimanyu Dassani (BCCL/ Aditya Yadav)

Is the before-the-camera fright any less with your second film?

Do you feel pressurised by your mom’s success? Does it bug you when you’re constantly called her son and not an individual entity?

Has being Bhagyashree’s son helped you in Bollywood.

What’s your take on nepotism?

What’s your parents reaction now that you’re doing your second film?

Is the Friday before the release a fear factor for you?

What’s your biggest fear now.

Abhimanyu Dassani maybe just one film old in Bollywood but he talks like a veteran. Son of Maine Pyaar Kiya fame actress Bhagyashree , Abhimanyu was shooting in Lucknow for his next when we caught up with him. A foodie at heart, while Lucknow proved to be a haven for him, Abhimanyu says that being his mother’s son has been of no help in his acting career and the finance graduate feels proud to say that “no one held my hand and said they will launch me in Bollywood”.Excerpts from the young actor’s interaction with LT.I used to come to Lucknow quite frequently because I was into infrastructure for a while. But this trip to Lucknow when I was shooting for Nikamma has been absolutely fantastic. It warms my heart, it’s a special city to me now. I have absolutely loved-loved and loved the food here. The weather was amazing and the people were so warm and friendly. I can’t wait to come back to Lucknow, I’m being honest and spend some more time here, eat some more amazing food. A shout out to Mughal’s Dastarkhwan for giving me the best galawati kababs I’ve ever had. And haan yaar, bahut mazaa aaya, bahut achha khana khaya, bahut achha weather tha and humne bahut achha kaam kiya. Ab aur main kya maang sakta hoon? It was all perfect in Lucknow.Abhimanyu Dassani (BCCL/ Aditya Yadav)Before-the-camera fright, I haven’t had that because I have been in the industry for the last ten years now. It’s exciting to get in front of the camera. Haan woh 30 seconds jo hota hai camera ke saamne aane ke baad action aur cut ke beech mein, I feel like Superman, I feel like Popeye after he’s had some spinach. But yes, this is an absolutely new school, new genre for me so before going sets I watched a lot of films, did a lot of research and in fact, I also spoke to Ranveer Singh on his film Simmba because it’s the same genre. But yes, I was nervous when I was on set but once I was in front of the camera, it was all fine. I love being in front of the camera.Sach toh bol rahe hain yaar. I am mother’s son toh aur kya bolenge. But the intention behind that is to kind of a product of nepotism , which is not true. Anyone who’s seen my film and refers to me as Surya or the man who feels no pain, as in Mard Ko Dard Nahi Hota, that really excites me because Surya is much more famous than Abhimanyu and speaks volumes for what I have done in my film and in international cinema. So it would be great if people appreciated that and kind of like and gave me the credit for whatever I have achieved as an actor already.No. Not at all. Being ‘Bhagyashree’s son’ hasn’t helped me at all. For everyone I am just Abhimanyu Dassani.So it’s about time that we know the truth about nepotism because people have actually blurred and distorted the whole true meaning behind it. And most don’t understand what it is and what process is. It happens in every industry, all over the world. It’s a fact of life and life is unfair and it’s unfair to everyone at some point and that’s what makes it fair. So, no, we just gotta move ahead with it and whoever is speaking on it, your poster boy or poster girl, for the outsiders, quote-unquote are actually in the industry because of nepotism. So….They’re very excited because they’ve seen me change from Surya, this self-confident boy who’s energetic and loves to do everything for everybody to become this nikamma at home. And they’ve seen that gradual change in me to that person I was to the character that I am. So they’re very excited to actually see what I have done because that’s not me as a person. I’m not that loud. So they’re excited to see how I’ve challenged myself and portrayed myself in this upcoming film of mine. I can’t wait for them to see it and I really (emphasises) want my parents to be proud of me.Not at all. For me it’s always been about the journey and the effort that I’ve put in. And I love the grind and getting dirty and going through the whole process and that’s what I’m actually in love with. The results are not in my hands, you can call it luck, fate destiny, whatever you want, but as long as you put in your hundred percent, which I hope and strive to do, every single day, so you know, today, tomorrow or day after, the results will come as long as you work hard and you’re proud of the work that you’ve done in a day, you sleep peacefully. And to be honest, at the end of the day that’s what really matters, right?You know, being able to act and being able to do what I love to do, it makes me feel alive. And you never know, a day mighty come when I’m not able to do what I want to do, not do what I love to do. I think that’s the day I fear most. I don’t know how to exactly put it in words, but it is what it is.",lucknow,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74135736,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-243382,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/no-one-held-my-hand-and-said-they-will-launch-me-in-bollywood-abhimanyu-dassani/articleshow/74135776.cms

Now, I feel lighter and full of energy.”Given that her profession includes a lot of travelling, how easy is it going to find vegetarian fare everywhere?

The only trouble is when you are travelling abroad — in many countries, it’s easier to get grilled chicken and fish. But where there is a will, there is a way. If nothing, my team buys any vegetable they can find, and cooks it with some yellow dal and rice, almost like a khichdi.

Not just Bollywood stars, even the sporting fraternity was missing

Celebs who visited this year

The section called'Why Attend' on the official website of the 2020 Auto Expo has one point that states visitors can ""get up close and personal with movie stars, sports icons"". For years, celebrity spotting has been integral to the mega auto show. This year, however, a combination of factors – most notably slowdown in the auto sector and the Coronavirus scare – meant that the celebrity footfall at the event was negligible.Held at the India Expo Mart in Greater Noida between Feb 7 and 12, the expo registered a footfall of over six lakh – highest ever – as per the organisers. The celebrity footfall, however, reduced by almost half. The previous editions of the event have seen about a dozen celebs every time with the 2016 expo seeing visits from 15 celebrities. This year, the number was eight. Shah Rukh Khan was among the rare big names who visited the expo this year but he did so on the opening day of the event, which is open only for exhibitors and not the general public. In fact, the only film stars who visited the expo on days open for the public were Gul Panag and Soha Ali Khan . Most of the other celebs, including Daler Mehndi and Huma Qureshi, visited on the first two days, when the show wasn't open for general public. This was in stark contrast with the previous editions that saw names like Akshay Kumar, Priyanka Chopra, Kareena Kapoor , Alia Bhatt, and Ranbir Kapoor among others visit on the days open for public.According to an executive with a Japanese auto manufacturer at the expo, ""The stars are mostly called by the brands they endorse to launch a new vehicle. But if you notice, there were fewer launches than ever at the Auto Expo this time. That's why most brands did not bother calling their brand ambassadors. The number of launches has been low because of a general slowdown in the auto sector in India."" Someone like John Abraham – who has been constant at the show for over a decade – was conspicuous by his absence.A lot of visitors and exhibitors at the event could be seen wearing face masks in light of the Coronavirus scare prevalent in all of Asia. Was that also a reason for some stars staying away? Exhibitors say it could have contributed to some of them giving the event a miss. ""Nobody has said on record that this is the reason a star won't visit but many stars' representatives did express concerns about it. It may not have been the biggest reason but could have been a factor in some people's decision,” says an organiser on the condition of anonymity.The absence of celebs did not mean fewer people at the expo but it did dull the experience for many. Nachiket S, a Gurgaon resident who has been visiting the expo since 2012, says, ""There is no time table as to when a star will visit the expo. But in previous years, there were one or two celebs every year. This year, there was nobody for days. The main aim of my going there was to see the cars but it was strange not even getting a glimpse of one star."" Tanya Singh, a student, adds, ""Our college is close to the venue we go there every year. My seniors have selfies with stars they met at the expo in the previous editions. But we found nobody there this time. It looked slightly low key.""But it's not just Bollywood that has been absent from the expo this year. The sporting fraternity hasn't made its presence felt either. While previous editions of the event would see visits by top cricketers like Virat Kohli, Sachin Tendulkar, Zaheer Khan, and Gautam Gambhir , this year, the only sportsperson present was former Formula One driver Narain Karthikeyan . ""With the Indian cricket team on tour and most other top stars busy with other commitments, none of them could be here. Sachin, who was a constant here for the auto brand he endorses, was also not available,"" says an insider from the organising team. The Indian cricket team – led by Virat Kohli – are touring New Zealand while Sachin Tendulkar was in Australia to take part in a charity cricket match held simultaneously as the expo. It is the first time in a decade that Sachin wasn't present at the biennial event.SRK led a handful of celebs, including Huma Qureshi, Soha Ali Khan, Daler Mehndi, Gul Panag, Angad Bedi and Narain Karthikeyan, who didattend the expo this year",noida,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74135833,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-261335,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/auto-expo-less-star-power-this-year/articleshow/74135847.cms
22,['15/02/2020'],How journaling helps boost mental health,"Writing, especially anything positive or humourous helps alleviates depression.

Reading your posts lead to higher levels of self-confidence. For instance if you document how you may have felt during a relationship that ended and compare with the present, it will make you see how far you have come.

Writing is a relaxing task and aids better sleep.

On the work front, if you keep a journal of your tasks, it makes for a kind of checklist that can motivate you to do more. It also gives an at-a-glance look at what has worked and what hasn’t.

It also boosts the immune system.

You’ve probably taken down culinary jottings while cooking, notes during an office meeting or even written something absent-mindedly while waiting for a friend. Now, make that a habit. Writing regularly in a diary about one’s personal occurrences and experiences as well as personal reflections, called journaling, is a top strategy for better mental health. Says 38-year-old stock market analyst Tamira Shah, “I never had a diary during my teens or even later. A few months ago, a friend suggested I try journaling. I began with writing once a week and now I do so everyday. It really helped me relax and destress.” A famous quote by Oscar Wilde goes: “I never travel without my diary. One should always have something sensational to read on the train.” Time you started doing so, too...Studies show that penning thoughts this way can have numerous positive effects.- Begin with journaling a pleasant memory or event. Putting such positive thoughts to paper spells positive reinforcement. So, if the week starts off on a wrong note, you can always go back to the happy experience you had a few days ago.- Be true to yourself in your journal.- Writing about nature — the blue sky, rain, and breeze, is seen to be destressing. - It’s a good idea to paste stickers on your pages. If it’s a food page, use a foodie sticker or doodle. For a travel post, add a small ticket or souvenir from a place you visited.- Don’t let the entries be long-winding. Short is the keyword.",life-style,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74135897,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-31411/74135897.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//life-style/relationships/love-sex/how-journaling-is-a-key-to-boost-mental-health/articleshow/74135387.cms

24,['15/02/2020'],Amol Palekar's acting prowess keeps audience on tenterhooks,"Co-directed by Sandhya Gokhale (Amol Palekar 's wife), 'Kusur' (The Mistake) revolves around a retired Assistant Commissioner of Police Ashok Dandavate ( Amol Palekar), who has been deputed to the emergency control room of the Mumbai Police . Adapted from Gustav Möller 's Danish film, ' Den Skyldige ', the play is a well-crafted and engaging story of a police officer who is awaiting his trial the next day. In that one night, he oscillates between attending endless phone calls from people seeking police assistance and his conscience pricking him for the guilt of his past actions.Of those frantic phone calls asking for police assistance, one particular one irks him the most. It is the wavering voice of a middle-aged woman, pitched with fear and tension, and who is sobbing between the words. He believes she has been kidnapped by her husband. Despite being repeatedly warned by his friends and colleagues to not get emotionally involved in the cases he is handling, he does exactly that.The plot is simple and predictable. It picks up pace only after this particular woman calls up. One is left wondering as to who this woman is and what is the intent behind her husband kidnapping her and taking her away from their young children.The play marks Palekar's comeback to stage after almost 25 years, and the veteran actor brings the same affability and relatability to his character as he does in films like 'Golmaal', ' Chitchor ' and ' Rajnigandha ', among others.It's not an easy role to play, be it physically or emotionally, but Palekar manages to do full justice to the role. With Palekar's powerful acting and well-coordinated sound design, this 80-minute solo act keeps the audience on tenterhooks. The set design is minimalist and features a simple table that has control panels, buzzing telephones and blinking lights that immediately transport you to the control room and help in building suspense.With Palekar's character, who brings forth a whole gamut of emotions, 'Kusur' (The Mistake) highlights the fact that despite one's good intentions, sometimes it gets difficult to let go of one's prejudices.",entertainment,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74134182,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-28223/74134182.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/hindi/theatre/amol-palekars-acting-prowess-keeps-audience-on-tenterhooks/articleshow/74134188.cms

Not just Bollywood stars, even the sporting fraternity was missing

Celebs who visited this year

The section called'Why Attend' on the official website of the 2020 Auto Expo has one point that states visitors can ""get up close and personal with movie stars, sports icons"". For years, celebrity spotting has been integral to the mega auto show. This year, however, a combination of factors – most notably slowdown in the auto sector and the Coronavirus scare – meant that the celebrity footfall at the event was negligible.Held at the India Expo Mart in Greater Noida between Feb 7 and 12, the expo registered a footfall of over six lakh – highest ever – as per the organisers. The celebrity footfall, however, reduced by almost half. The previous editions of the event have seen about a dozen celebs every time with the 2016 expo seeing visits from 15 celebrities. This year, the number was eight. Shah Rukh Khan was among the rare big names who visited the expo this year but he did so on the opening day of the event, which is open only for exhibitors and not the general public. In fact, the only film stars who visited the expo on days open for the public were Gul Panag and Soha Ali Khan . Most of the other celebs, including Daler Mehndi and Huma Qureshi, visited on the first two days, when the show wasn't open for general public. This was in stark contrast with the previous editions that saw names like Akshay Kumar, Priyanka Chopra, Kareena Kapoor , Alia Bhatt, and Ranbir Kapoor among others visit on the days open for public.According to an executive with a Japanese auto manufacturer at the expo, ""The stars are mostly called by the brands they endorse to launch a new vehicle. But if you notice, there were fewer launches than ever at the Auto Expo this time. That's why most brands did not bother calling their brand ambassadors. The number of launches has been low because of a general slowdown in the auto sector in India."" Someone like John Abraham – who has been constant at the show for over a decade – was conspicuous by his absence.A lot of visitors and exhibitors at the event could be seen wearing face masks in light of the Coronavirus scare prevalent in all of Asia. Was that also a reason for some stars staying away? Exhibitors say it could have contributed to some of them giving the event a miss. ""Nobody has said on record that this is the reason a star won't visit but many stars' representatives did express concerns about it. It may not have been the biggest reason but could have been a factor in some people's decision,” says an organiser on the condition of anonymity.The absence of celebs did not mean fewer people at the expo but it did dull the experience for many. Nachiket S, a Gurgaon resident who has been visiting the expo since 2012, says, ""There is no time table as to when a star will visit the expo. But in previous years, there were one or two celebs every year. This year, there was nobody for days. The main aim of my going there was to see the cars but it was strange not even getting a glimpse of one star."" Tanya Singh, a student, adds, ""Our college is close to the venue we go there every year. My seniors have selfies with stars they met at the expo in the previous editions. But we found nobody there this time. It looked slightly low key.""But it's not just Bollywood that has been absent from the expo this year. The sporting fraternity hasn't made its presence felt either. While previous editions of the event would see visits by top cricketers like Virat Kohli, Sachin Tendulkar, Zaheer Khan, and Gautam Gambhir , this year, the only sportsperson present was former Formula One driver Narain Karthikeyan . ""With the Indian cricket team on tour and most other top stars busy with other commitments, none of them could be here. Sachin, who was a constant here for the auto brand he endorses, was also not available,"" says an insider from the organising team. The Indian cricket team – led by Virat Kohli – are touring New Zealand while Sachin Tendulkar was in Australia to take part in a charity cricket match held simultaneously as the expo. It is the first time in a decade that Sachin wasn't present at the biennial event.SRK led a handful of celebs, including Huma Qureshi, Soha Ali Khan, Daler Mehndi, Gul Panag, Angad Bedi and Narain Karthikeyan, who didattend the expo this year",auto,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74135833,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-261335,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//auto/miscellaneous/auto-expo-less-star-power-this-year/articleshow/74148053.cms

27,['15/02/2020'],Music review: Shubh Mangal Zyada Saavdhan,"Directed by Hitesh Kewalya, the upcoming social romcom ' Shubh Mangal Zyada Saavdhan ' has Ayushmann Khurrana Jitendra Kumar , Gajraj Rao and Neena Gupta headlining the cast.A spin-off to 2017’s ' Shubh Mangal Saavdhan ', which dealt with erectile dysfunction, the film focuses on same-sex relationship this time.The soundtrack is as interesting as the subject and opens with a quintessential Bollywood love song with the song 'Mere Liye Tum Kaafi Ho', which captures the essence of the film beautifully. This track has multiple things going for it. Right from actor-singer Ayushmann’s effortless crooning to Tanishk ’s fresh composition or Vayu ’s simple, yet heart-whelming words like, ‘Yeh duniya mile na mile humko, khushiyan bhaga dengi har gham ko/ Tum saath ho phir kya baaki ho, mere liye tum kaafi ho’. While the gender-neutral lyrics capture the universal, all-encompassing emotion of love, Shomu Seal’s guitar and Tanishk’s programming with the addictive beats are worth a hear. This could easily be one of Tanishk’s best compositions.Around 35 years ago Bappi Lahiri’s 'Yaar Bina Chain Kahan Re' ('Saaheb', 1985) with lyrics by Anjaan, was not just a chart-buster, it had also won popular awards. Composed by Bappida (as he is popularly called), a pioneer of disco music in the 80s, he also sang the song with S Janaki.Now, the iconic track has been recreated as 'Arey Pyaar Kar Le' by Tanishk and Ayushmann completely rocks this new version as he wields the mic along with the original singer. The song, penned by Vayu with rap by Ikka, does notdisappoint.The third track 'Pyaar Tenu Karda Gabru' is debuting our Top 20 Charts at Number 9. This is not the first time that Ayushmann-Tanishk-Romy-Vayu have worked together, they have been heard in 'Badhaaiyan Tenu' ('Badhai Ho', 2018) earlier. Inspired by the Yo Yo Honey Singh song, 'Gabru', the song has not been altered much by Tanishk. It also has the lead actors show off their moves in this typical Punjabi dance number.",entertainment,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74135089,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-113605/74135089.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/hindi/music/music-reviews/music-review-shubh-mangal-zyada-saavdhan/articleshow/74135089.cms
28,['15/02/2020'],Love don't cost a thing? Rejection might!,"On Valentine's Day, you planned the perfect evening – a romantic meal, some champagne, or a romantic movie night. You also planned on proposing to your lady love, albeit through the clichéd methods – hiding a ring in the champagne flute or going down on one knee while the most romantic song plays that evening. Sounds about right? You've not factored in one key element, though – the girl rejecting your proposal, or maybe, her not turning up!On February 14, dinner dates can be harrowing if things don't go well, and when we spoke to staff members of various hotels and restaurants, they told us that the ultimate question, after all those rejections and heartbreaks, is, 'who will pay the bill – the boy, the girl, or well, the staff?'A staff member of a restaurant tells us, ""On Valentine's Day, a couple came in and right before they placed the order, the guy proposed to the girl. I assume she said no because the boy kept asking her why she even came for the date. After about 30-40 minutes, after we kept asking them to place their order, the guy turned to me and, in a calm voice, said, 'Iss ladki ne mere Rs 50-70k restaurant mein ek mahine mein uda diye. Aur yeh abb mujhe mana kar rahi hai.' He then told the girl, 'Theek hai phir! Aaj ka bill toh tu hi degi.' He then placed an order for the most expensive food and drinks on the menu, while the girl remained silent. He ensured that the girl paid the bill, which amounted to around Rs 10-12k.”You may have been rejected and thought that others around you didn't hear your embarrassment; however, this is far from the truth. A staffer at a restaurant tells us, ""We once had a couple on Valentine's Day, who looked like they were college students. He must have proposed to the girl, because she said out loud – 'No. We're just friends'. I wasn't trying to eavesdrop, but it was a small restaurant so I couldn't help hearing the conversation. When I gave him the bill, the boy took out his card and said – 'We're just friends, so we'll split the bill as friends do.' He didn't seem embarrassed, but it was quite embarrassing for me.""There are times when the girl walks out on you but if it happens on Valentine's Day, my friend, you're doomed. This once happened to a young man at a Hauz Khas Village (HKV) restaurant. The manager narrates the incident, saying, ""On Valentine's Day, some boys go overboard. I was working at a popular restaurant chain in HKV, where a boy made elaborate arrangements for the evening. I assume the girl thought it's a get-together and not a date, because the moment she saw the arrangements, she was like 'NO', and left. The guy neither said anything nor stopped her, but he was so heartbroken that he started howling. I felt sad for him, so, whatever he had ordered till then, I told him the bill will be on me.""A staff member of a restaurant chain also tells us, ""On Valentine's Day, sometimes couples place an order and before the meal arrives, they fight and the order is returned. Sometimes they leave just after having starters, and at times, one person is left at the table crying, and the manager, to retain the client, takes care of the bill.""A head staff member of a restaurant chain shares, ""It seems that people love creating a scene during V-Day dinners – be it angrily throwing wine on their partner, crying hysterically, calling their ex or just fighting because they didn't like the gift. But some guests compensate for their partner's misbehaviour by leaving a good tip for their waiter. On Valentine's Day, a married couple had a non-stop argument, so much that other guests felt uncomfortable. When they were leaving, the lady told her husband to double the tip for the inconvenience they caused.""",life-style,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74133858,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-25561/74133858.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//life-style/relationships/love-sex/love-dont-cost-a-thing-rejection-might/articleshow/74133890.cms

32,['15/02/2020'],Rift over Elgar move? Pawar says Maha step 'not proper',"This story is from February 15, 2020

KOLHAPUR: NCP chief Sharad Pawar on Friday expressed his disapproval regarding Maharashtra CM Uddhav Thackeray's consent to hand over the investigation of the Elgar Parishad case to the National Investigation Agency (NIA).

""It was not proper for the Union government to take over the investigation from the state government in the first place, and it was not at all proper for the state government to grant consent,"" Pawar said in Kolhapur. He, however, added that it was the CM's prerogative to take the decision.

Pawar said the Union government decided to take over the Elgar case investigation at 3pm on the same day that the state government had a meeting on the subject from 9am to 11am. ""Law and order is a state topic but the Union government went ahead with its move, which is not proper,"" he said. Pawar has been demanding that a special investigation team headed by a senior IPS officer look into the complaints against some police and home department officers in connection with the Elgar case.

The state law and judiciary department had said that it was within the powers of the Union government to take over the case. The Elgar case file, along with the opinion of the law and judiciary department, was sent to state home minister Anil Deshmukh of the NCP, who was not keen to hand over the investigation to the NIA.

Deshmukh had contended that the state government should request the Union government to reconsider its decision as the Pune police had made considerable progress in the investigation. He was also insisting that the state government seek the opinion of the advocate general.

The file, along with Deshmukh's opinion and the views of the law and judiciary department, was sent to Thackeray on Wednesday and he approved of the investigation by NIA. Accordingly, the home department issued an order saying it had no objection to the NIA taking over the investigation. Deshmukh said on Thursday that Thackeray had overruled his proposal.

When asked to comment on Pawar's statement, Sena spokesperson Neelam Gorhe said, ""The CM must have taken the decision in the larger interest of Maharashtra, one should not look for any political point. The CM must have applied his conscience while taking the decision.""

Congress spokesperson Sachin Sawant preferred not to comment on Thackeray's decision ands Pawar's reservation about the same.

“The specifications have been made to see that the vehicles don’t lose balance and there is no overloading. Till now there is no uniform standard and we are fixing the norms,” said a source. As per the proposal, the boxes shall not exceed 550 mm in length, 510 mm in width and 500 mm in height. The weight of the container including its mounting and the load carried in the container shall not exceed 30 kgs.

This will also become applicable from October 1.

As per the draft notification, vehicles, which gets the Tyre Pressure Monitoring System (TPMS), will have to comply with the norms. This will minimise accidents risks and will also help increase the fuel efficiency.

A group of 25 foreign envoys were in J&K earlier this week

NEW DELHI: The European Union asked the Indian government to ""lift the remaining restrictions"" in J&K ""swiftly"" while acknowledging that India had taken positive steps to restore normalcy. The statement came even as NSA Ajit Doval met with the envoys just back from their visit to Kashmir on Friday.

Following a visit to J&K by 25 foreign envoys, which included some European Union ambassadors, the EU issued a statement from Brussels on Friday, saying: ""The visit confirmed that the Government of India has taken positive steps to restore normalcy. Some restrictions remain, notably on internet access and mobile services, and some political leaders are still in detention. While we recognise the serious security concerns, it is important that the remaining restrictions be lifted swiftly,"" the statement from Virginie Battu-Henriksson, EU spokesperson for foreign affairs and security policy, read.

It said the programme by the government ""included meetings with civil and military authorities, political representatives, as well as selected members of civil and business community...The visit presented a welcome opportunity to see the situation on the ground and to interact with local interlocutors.""

The EU statement comes days before foreign minister S Jaishankar is scheduled to travel to Brussels for talks with EU and to prepare for PM Modi's forthcoming summit in Brussels scheduled for March 13. Meanwhile, others like the Afghan ambassador Tahir Qadiry went on record to say it was ""great to come to Kashmir, it's good to see the 'mehman nawaz' people of Kashmir.""

37,['15/02/2020'],"Sanjeev Chawla invokes govt's vow to UK, sent to Tihar jail","This story is from February 15, 2020

NEW DELHI: The Delhi high court stepped in on Friday to cancel the police custody of alleged bookie Sanjeev Chawla , recently extradited from the UK, taking note of his claim that Indian government had assured its British counterpart that he will be kept in Tihar Jail.

Chawla, a British citizen who is key accused in one of cricket's biggest match-fixing scandals that involved former South African captain Hansie Cronje, had been sent to face custodial interrogation of Delhi Police's crime branch by a trial court on Thursday.

Directing the police to ensure that Chawla goes to Tihar immediately, Justice Anu Malhotra said he will be in judicial custody till further orders, even as the bench made Union home ministry (MHA) a party to the case, seeking its stand along with that of the police. Appearing for Chawla, senior advocate Vikas Pahwa cited three letters of assurance (LoA) given by MHA to the United Kingdom clearly stated that he has to be extradited to face trial in the case, in which police filed a chargesheet in 2013. He maintained that the MHA also assured UK government the Chawla will be kept in Tihar Jail as an undertrial and later, if found guilty, as a convict.

""The police remand goes against the assurances given to the UK. Where is the need for custody when the chargesheet has been filed and investigation is over? This is not the mandate of extradition proceedings which have only allowed my client to face trial,"" the counsel submitted before HC.

The court said it was essential to hear the Centre on the matter as the letters of assurances were issued by the MHA. The petition referred to the MHA's letters dated February 28, 2017, September 22, 2017 and June 11, 2018 giving assurances to the UK government. ""The said assurances are the sovereign assurances given by the government of India and are binding upon the government and enforcing agencies inasmuch as the guarantees and assurances are the basis of extradition,"" it said. ""The Indian government had given assurances which are solemn and sovereign assurances that at all times, during pre-trial custody, the petitioner would be lodged in Tihar Jail and therefore, no police remand can be granted,"" the plea said.

The trial court on Thursday had sent Chawla to 12-day custodial interrogation by Delhi Police, noting the matter was to be probed further for which he had to be sent to various cities across the nation.

Since the investigating officer of the case wasn’t present in HC during the hearing that lasted after the official court hours, Justice Anu Malhotra directed the crime branch to file a status report on the matter while asking MHA too to respond by next date of hearing on February 19.

38,['15/02/2020'],"Four days after he got bail, Kafeel Khan held under NSA","This story is from February 15, 2020

AGRA: The UP police late on Thursday night slapped the National Security Act (NSA) on Gorakhpur paediatrician Kafeel Khan , hours before he was expected to walk free from Mathura jail, four days after he was granted bail by an Aligarh court.

Aligarh district magistrate CB Singh said, ""Protests had continued in the city and AMU for days after Khan delivered an inflammatory speech on the university campus. In fact, students turned violent on the campus on December 15"".

Deputy inspector general (Aligarh) Akash Kulhary told TOI that the NSA allows preventive detention for months if the authorities feel that the person is a threat to national security or law and order.

Khan was booked on December 13 under section 153A of the IPC (promoting enmity between different groups) for a speech at AMU during an anti-CAA protest a day earlier and was arrested from Mumbai airport on January 29 by UP Police's special task force. He was remanded in judicial custody for 14 days on January 30.

Khan continues to be in Mathura jail despite bail being granted to him by the CJM's court on February 10.

Khan's younger brother, Kashif Jameel, who visited Mathura jail on Friday hoping to take his brother back home, told TOI that he was very disappointed with the government's decision of slapping NSA on his brother.

""My brother is being harassed by the government because of his surname 'Khan'. Many political leaders, including those from BJP, had given inflammatory speeches but none of them have been harassed like my brother. They are trying to suppress his voice,"" he said.

On Friday, Khan's wife Shabistan Khan also reached Mathura jail to meet her husband but she started feeling unwell after she came to know about the NSA charges against him.

Khan's lawyer Irfan Ghazi said they would soon challenge imposition of NSA in court. ""The state government doesn't want him to get out of jail,"" he said.

Claiming a threat to Khan's life in jail, Ghazi said that he has been isolated from other prison inmates and is not getting his medicines.

PATNA: Love was in the air as Patnaites celebrated Valentine’s Day at coffee shops, malls, hotels, clubs and restaurants across the city on Friday. Most of them spent the day together, ate dinner at fancy restaurants and posted pictures on social media.

Cafés and restaurants lured a large number of customers, especially couples, by introducing exciting offers on V-Day. They also made arrangements for special delicacies, music, dance and games. Shreshkar, the owner of a restaurant on Boring Road, told this newspaper, “We gave several combo offers to couples, as a result of which we witnessed an insane footfall in the afternoon and at night.”

The manager of a confectionery on Boring Road claimed that customized waffles were in high demand. “Many people told us to make heart-shaped waffles with their partners’ names on them. We, on the other hand, asked them to stick notes for their loved ones on a V-Day special board,” he said.

Meanwhile, youngsters had an amazing time on V-Day. Boring Road resident Ankita Sinha, who got married in December last year, said, “This was my first V-Day after marriage. I baked a cake for my hubby and cooked his favourite dish. I also decorated my house with red balloons.”

Kadamkuan resident Shivam Kumar does not believe in celebrating V-Day, but took his girlfriend on a surprise dinner. He said, “Later, we went on a long drive together.”

Singletons, on the other hand, celebrated the day with their friends. “Like every year, my best friend and I watched a movie and drank coffee. We exchanged handmade cards as well,” said Khushboo Kumari, a resident of Danapur.

Rajkot: A resident of Jasdan was arrested on Friday for allegedly stabbing an 18-year-old youth to death in Lati plot locality of Jasdan in Rajkot district on Thursday evening.

Police said the accused, Sanjay Makwana (24) along with his aides — Kiran Makwana and Anil Makwana —, had allegedly stabbed to death Kiran Parmar over old enmity.

“Kiran and Parmar, who were classmates in Jasdan Industrial Training Institute (ITI), lived in the same locality of Ambedkarnagar in Jasdan. They used to have frequent fights over trivial issues. Nursing a grudge against Parmar, Kiran and his aides decided to kill him,” said N H Joshi, sub-inspector with Jasdan police station.

On the fateful day, Parmar along with his cousin Jaideep had gone to the ITI. After the classes were over, Kiran called up Parmar on his phone and asked him to come to Lati plot where both fought with each other. Kiran and his aides had come armed with the intention to kill Parmar, and hence they attacked him with knives. When Jaideep intervened, he, too, was attacked.

Parmar after being stabbed four to five times, was rushed to Jasdan Civil Hospital, where he succumbed to injuries. His family members, who refused to accept his body, ultimately claimed the body and performed the last rites after the police arrested Sanjay.

Meanwhile, the police have intensified manhunt for other accused Kiran and Anil.

Parmar’s grandfather Gordhan Parmar is an ex-member of Jasdan municipality, while his father Ramesh Parmar works as a driver.

SURAT: A man wanted in the murder of his wife for the last eight years was caught by the sleuths of Surat crime branch from Ganjam district in Odisha on Friday.

The accused, identified as Kalucharan Gaud (31) a resident of Saroda village in Odisha’s Ganjam district, had eloped with one Rinki Shetty, a resident of Makhanpur village in Odisha’s Ganjam district in 2011. The duo had come to Surat and both started residing in Utkalnagar slums in Katargam. The accused started working in an embroidery unit in Katargam.

In 2012, Rinki delivered a baby girl. However, Gaud suspected Shetty to be involved in an extra-marital relationship and did not accept the girl. The duo would fight with each other on various occasions and Gaud would thrash her accusing her of giving birth to a baby girl born out of her illicit relationship.

On March 1, 2012, Gaud came home in the afternoon and picked up a fight with his wife. Gaud allegedly strangled her and escaped from the spot. A complaint in this connection was registered by Katargam police station, following which the police launched a manhunt for Gaud.

“Meanwhile, we got a tip-off about Gaud, and we traced his location to Babanpur village in Odisha’s Ganjam district. Gaud was working as a masonry in the village and had married to some other woman,” said C R Desai, sub-inspector with Surat crime branch.

BENGALURU: In a breather for Amazon India and Flipkart, the Karnataka high court on Friday granted an interim stay into a probe ordered by the Competition Commission of India (CCI) against the e-tailers’ business practices. The court has given two months for all the parties involved, which include trade body associations of small merchants, to respond to the plea before it hears the matter again.Trade bodies Confederation of All India Traders (CAIT) and Delhi Vyapar Mahasangh (DVM), on whose complaint the probe was initiated, have decided to file an appeal against the HC order “very soon”, a statement by CAIT said.The court’s decision is a relief for Amazon and Flipkart, which is owned by US-based retail giant Walmart. Both the e-taliers have faced tightening regulations as protests from traders against their business practices have increased. Both the US-based companies have invested billions in India, but have faced complaints of deep discounting and favouritism towards select sellers, among others. As TOI reported on Friday, CCI had began a probe but the judgment is a temporary setback for the anti-trust regulator.DVM representatives had gone to the CCI office in Delhi on Thursday for their deposition. “While we welcome and respect the decision of the court, this is just a step in the legal process. We are confident about our compliance,” an Amazon spokesperson said. Flipkart did not respond to an emailed query by TOI.During the hearing, Flipkart’s legal counsel made the company’s first official submission on the matter, essentially agreeing with arch-rival Amazon’s plea on the CCI probe. Flipkart also highlighted that the competition regulator did not have adequate prima facie evidence for a probe under section 26 (1) of the Competition Commission Act, by which an investigation cannot be appealed to CCI. Amazon India had sought an interim stay on the matter under Article 226 of the Constitution of India, under which one can appeal to stay such a probe.“CCI was arguing that the matter cannot be given an interim stay under Article 226 but Amazon submitted a list of such cases under the said section where such interim stay has been given, including one by the Karnataka HC elated to Intel. Amazon’s team prepared the list overnight after Friday’s arguments by CCI,” said one of the legal representatives of Amazon, who did not wish to be quoted.Earlier, Amazon cited cases, where such a probe was quashed by the apex court and the Bombay HC. This was reiterated by Flipkart in the court as well. Justice P S Dinesh Kumar was the judge hearing the matter.Amitabh Kumar, former director-general at CCI and a former partner at law firm J Sagar Associates, said that an order under Section 26(1) is a prima facie one and law does not mandate a hearing before passing such order. “The CCI can call for a preliminary conference before passing prima facie order and has done so many times in the past but not in all cases. It may be difficult to challenge for not having called the party(s) for a preliminary conference. However, sufficiency and adequacy of evidence before the regulator for a prima facie order has yet to be determined by judicial pronouncements,” Kumar said.Legal experts said there is a likelihood that the matter might end up in the Supreme Court.CCI’s January 13 order to probe Amazon came days before the company’s CEO Jeff Bezos landed in India last month, where he announced $1 billion of new investment. Right after Bezos’s announcement, commerce and industry minister Piyush Goyal kicked up a row saying Amazon wasn’t ‘doing any favour’ to India by investing as it was to cover up losses, even questioning how a marketplace could lose so much money.The complaint against Amazon and Flipkart has been in the making for a while as small traders have been complaining to the government over various practices by e-tailer throughout 2019, which eventually led CCI to announce the probe. Prior to that, CCI had conducted a detailed study on the e-commerce market. Also, effective February last year, the government tightened the laws for FDI in e-commerce which forced Amazon and Flipkart to make operational changes that affected their relations with certain sellers. For example, Amazon reduced its stake to 24% from 49% in Cloudtail, one of the largest sellers on Amazon India, following the new FDI guidelines.",business,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74146323,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-123592,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/hc-relief-for-e-tailers-in-cci-probe/articleshow/74143489.cms

Aishe Ghosh speaks to students at Presidency University on Friday evening

KOLKATA/HOWRAH: Aishe Ghosh on Friday attacked RSS and its affiliates BJP and ABVP for targeting the student community and democratic atmosphere on campuses. The JNU students’ union president was at Jadavpur University to address members of the Students’ Federation of India (SFI). She said the RSS feared the nation-wide agitation by students against its ideology of a homogeneous culture and “Hindi, Hindu, Hindustan”.

Sources on campus said Ghosh attacked ABVP because the RSS-affiliated students’ body has fielded nine candidates in various panels in Arts and engineering for the first time. “It (ABVP) is an organization which sends masked goons to campuses to beat up those who stand for the rights of students and campus democracy. They believe in using force whereas universities are places that provide space for free speech and debates,” said Ghosh.

ABVP had earlier objected to Ghosh’s programme on the campus as the modal code of conduct has come into play. After the university authorities refused permission, Ghosh’s programme was shifted outside gate 4.

Earlier in the day, after walking in a rally in Howrah, the students’ leader said the Trinamool was creating space for RSS and BJP in the state by preventing others from hitting the streets against CAA and NRC. “If Trinamool was serious about resisting CAA and NRC, they would have aligned with other like-minded organizations,” said Ghosh who was prevented from attending a programme in Calcutta University on Thursday.

“The objective of Trinamool Congress is to create space for BJP and RSS in the state by muzzling all other voices,” Ghosh signed off.

In the evening, Ghosh addressed students at presidency University before visiting the sit-in at Park Circus to interact with the protesters who have been demonstrating there for over a month. More than 1,500 people turned up to see her. “I have immense respect for you who have been protesting here to save the country and the Constitution despite having so many other responsibilities. You are making a huge sacrifice and I have come to assure you that the entire student community is behind you. I will go back to Delhi and tell my comrades about the brave women of Kolkata. You have have scared the fascist forces who were trying to divide us on the basis of religion,” Ghosh told the crowd.

KOLKATA: Around 230 Presidency University students who live in the university’s girls’ hostel in Salt Lake defied the 10pm deadline on Thursday night, staying out till 11pm to assert their demand for relaxation of the curfew for practical and emergency purposes. University authorities, though, pointed out that the 10pm deadline was already beyond what other institutions permitted.On Thursday, the protesting girls finished dinner early and stepped out of the hostel at BF 141. They marched outside, shouting slogans against the hostel authorities, raising a host of issues, including the curfew hour. Some of the other issues were the lack of adequate drinking water facilities in the hostel, refusal to waive guest charges, absence of sanitary napkin vending machines and closure of hostel during vacations.The university authorities, who had earlier written to the guardians seeking their opinions on the relaxation of deadline, argued that the curfew hour at Presidency University was more relaxed than other institutes that did not have hostels on campus. “We will place the demand with the varsity administration,” a hostel official said.A senior university official said the 10pm deadline wasn’t unreasonable. “Most of the hostels in the city have a deadline of 8pm. Compared to that, the boarders of the girls’ hostel in Salt Lake get two extra hours to wrap up work and reach the hostel. When students stay in a hostel, their safety is the university’s responsibility. The deadline and other security measures have been put in place keeping in mind the well being of the boarders,” said the official.Students have been laying siege to the office of the dean of students for the past 48 hours. “We have been requesting the authorities to review the 10pm deadline. The last bus from the university on College Street reaches Salt Lake at 8pm. Thereafter, there is hardly any time to step out because we have to rush back by 10pm,” said Priyanka Das, one of the boarders.Students also alleged that the guest charge of Rs 250 per day — if a woman relative stayed over at times of emergency — was too steep. The hostel charges another Rs 30 for meals. The protesters also complained that the number of water purifiers was inadequate to cater to 230 students. “Last week, my roommate got food-poisoning and we had to call the superintendent for permission to take her to the hospital.

Giriraj Singh

PATNA: Top police officials came under attack of Union minister and Begusarai MP Giriraj Singh on Friday for their failure to control crime in the district.

The minister, a firebrand ‘Hindutva’ leader, spoke to Begusarai SP Awakash Kumar over phone on Friday, asking him to pull up his socks. Apparently upset over a spurt in crime, Giriraj said, “Tell the CM that either the people of Begusarai will vacate the district or I will tender my resignation.”

His remarks on the deteriorating law and order situation came on the sidelines of his visit to Phulwaria village, which witnessed three murders within a fortnight. After meeting the bereaved family members of a student, who was killed recently, Giriraj told the SP over phone, “You are an honest officer, but that does not mean everything is fine under your jurisdiction.”

Casting aspersions on police for working hand in glove with anti-social elements, the BJP MP said, “I came to know that police are more interested in picking up close relatives of the victims than initiating action against the accused. Even women are not being spared and summoned to police stations at night in violation of the prescribed rules.”

Giriraj also claimed that there was no fear of police among the criminals. “The situation can be gauged from the fact that three people were killed in Phulwaria alone in a fortnight. What is happening in the district?” he asked.

A transporter, Ravindra Rai and the student of a private school, Prince, were among those killed in the district recently. The Union minister also talked to DGP Gupteshwar Pandey over phone and sought his intervention in controlling crime in the district.

Later, a video depicting the conversation between the minister and the SP vent viral on social media. The SP, however, refused to make any comment on the issue. A DSP-rank officer posted in Begusarai, said, “This is not the way to talk to any IPS officer (read SP). He (Giriraj) is doing so to take political mileage and nothing else.”

Tejashwi Yadav

PATNA: Leader of opposition in state assembly Tejashwi Prasad Yadav will start his ‘Berozgari Hatao Yatra ’ in a customized bus christened ‘Yuva Kranti Rath’ from Patna on February 23.

Painted in various shades of green, the bus has been specially designed to meet rally needs and has slogans and issues written all over it. Tejashwi’s close aide Mani Yadav said the bus can accommodate 10 to 12 people.

The bus has RJD written on its front top and ‘New Bihar’ on the left side of the front glass. It also has photos of Tejashwi along with his parents – RJD chief Lalu Prasad and former chief minister Rabri Devi – and lantern, the party’s poll symbol.

On both sides of the bus, issues like employment, health, education, public welfare and socialism have been mentioned. It is also equipped with sound system and lights. As of now, the bus is parked inside Tejashwi’s official 1, Polo Road residence.

“People want employment, education and health facility. No one wants hatred or bloodshed which NDA government always focuses on. In this yatra, we will focus on people’s need and not on hatred,” Tejashwi said.

His another aide, Sanjay Yadav, said the opposition leader would cover all the districts in two months. “The schedule is being made in such a way that in big districts he will hold two public meetings and in smaller ones at least one meeting. Since the budget session is going to start, yatras will be done on non-working days,” said Sanjay.

The yatra will begin with a public gathering at Veterinary College ground in the state capital. On Friday, Tejashwi also addressed a meeting of RJD functionaries from Patna, Bhojpur and Vaishali and discussed with them the preparedness for the success of the yatra.

51,['15/02/2020'],‘BJP’s Delhi defeat increased CM Nitish Kumar’s bargaining power’,"This story is from February 15, 2020

Bihar CM Nitish Kumar

PATNA: Many political observers believe that the BJP’s recent defeat in Delhi has strengthened CM Nitish Kumar ’s bargaining power in the NDA and it would be visible during the finalization of seat-sharing with the saffron party for Bihar assembly election , likely to be held in October-November this year.

JD(U) leaders are hopeful of getting lion’s share in Bihar as far as NDA seat-sharing is concerned after the BJP’s big defeat in the national capital. “Given the BJP’s performance in Delhi polls, the JD(U) will certainly be in an advantageous position when the matter of seat-sharing will come up before the top NDA leaders. However, being a responsible ally, we will not discuss the seat-sharing issue before media,” a top JD(U) functionary, who did not want to be identified, told TOI on Friday.

“In fact, our bargaining power increased when the BJP lost the election in Jharkhand due to its sour relation with ally AJSU Party. The BJP lost elections in at least 14 assembly seats in Jharkhand as the AJSU Party candidates made dent in the votes of the saffron party. After Delhi results, our bargaining power has strengthened further,” he said.

A section of senior JD(U) functionaries admitted in private that the seat-sharing formula of 1:1.4 between the BJP and JD(U) floated by poll strategist Prashant Kishor a few weeks ago, had a very strong logic based on the seat-sharing during 2010 and performance of both the allies during 2015 election.

“Since Prashant is now out of the party, it will not be proper to react on his formula. The JD(U) may insist for more,” said another party leader.

JD(U) national secretary general K C Tyagi said there was no confusion among the NDA partners on the issue of seat-sharing for Bihar election. “Top leaders of JD(U), BJP and LJP will sit together at an appropriate time and finalize the seats as we did during the last Lok Sabha polls. The issue of seat-sharing is not discussed on public platforms or before media,” Tyagi told TOI.

He said the Delhi results would give a very positive impact in favour of the NDA in Bihar. “Arvind Kejriwal’s victory in Delhi has given a strong message that people will award only those who work for welfare of general public. In Bihar, Nitish Kumar is doing more for public welfare than Kejriwal,” he said, adding, “Nitish is an enlarged edition of Kejriwal”.

Bihar BJP spokesperson Nikhil Anand said the Delhi election result has reflected the local sentiment of the voters and it has nothing to do with Bihar politics.

“We are confident in Bihar because first of all, the BJP as well as our NDA allies, JD(U) and LJP, are extensively involved in strengthening the organizational structure at the grassroots level. Secondly, the NDA in Bihar has a long-standing credential where all the partners have a good voter base in state. Third reason is we have a proven face of Nitish who has been successfully leading the coalition governments in state since 2005. Fourth, though we couldn't succeed in Delhi, the unified campaign of NDA has given positive message to our cadres in Bihar. The NDA will sweep the 2020 assembly election in Bihar under the leadership of Nitish,” Anand said.

PATNA: Chief minister (CM) Nitish Kumar on Friday asked all state government offices, schools, other educational institutions as well as government organizations like boards and corporations to hold at least an hour-long programme on a working day every month to create awareness about environment protection and bad effects of climate change.

The CM issued the order during a high-level meeting convened at his residence to review the ongoing implementation of the state government’s Rs 24,524 crore ‘Jal Jivan Hariyali Abhiyan’.

“No other state in India has so far made provision to hold an hour-long programme on environment in its offices and schools every month. It is a unique decision taken by Bihar CM to protect environment,” a senior official told TOI.

He said as per the CM’s order, the schools, other educational institutions and government offices can hold either discussion, debate or different types of competitions on environmental issues with a motive to create awareness among public.

Besides the state’s chief secretary Deepak Kumar and development commissioner Arun Kumar Singh, heads of each important departments like education, health, environment and forest, road construction, water resources, agriculture, PHED and animal and fish resources were present at the meeting.

The CM asked the water resources department officials to work fast on the Ganga Water Lift Project so that safe drinking water could be supplied to the water-alarmed towns like Gaya, Rajgir and Nawada. Under the multi-crore project, the state government has planned to lift water from the Ganga river from Patna district and supply it to Gaya, Rajgir and Nawada towns through pipeline. The Ganga water will be thoroughly processed for drinking purpose within the supply chain system before going to the consumers’ tap.

He asked the officials to give priority to the work of land acquisition under the Ganga Water Lift Project so that the pipeline laying and other construction work could be expedited.

Rajkot: A builder was arrested on Friday for allegedly abetting suicide of a carpenter in Dwarkadhish Society near Gokuldham locality of Rajkot.

Police said the accused, identified as Jaman Kaneria (42), had allegedly abetted the suicide of Rakesh Dharaiya (42). Dharaiya had consumed pesticides at his home in Dwarkadhish Society on Tuesday. He died late that night.

According to the police, Kaneria had given contract of making furniture to Dharaiya, and he had made furnitures worth Rs 2.25 lakh. However, once the furniture was ready, Kaneria refused to make the payment.

“Dharaiya, who had brought the raw materials on credit, was under extreme pressure to pay off his debt, while Kaneria was not releasing the payment. This drove Dahariya to take the extreme step,” said N N Chudasma, inspector with Malaviyanagar police station.

In his suicide note, Dharaiya has blamed Kaneria for his death.

Surat: A 56-year-old man in Adajan was mowed down by a luxury bus when he fell down from his two-wheeler after he got entangled in an overhead cable wire hanging loosely on a tree in May 2019. This may be a rare incident, but the dangling cables and wires have emerged as a major safety concern for the pedestrians and vehicle drivers on the roads.

One could find the wires and cables hanging loosely on the trees, across the road, on the fly-overs, hoardings etc., at the major junctions and the main thoroughfares across the city, which are posing a serious threat to the pedestrians and two-wheeler riders.

Majority of the overhead cables and wires hanging dangerously across the city are of the internet and direct to home (DTH) service providers. These cables are hanging on the trees, flyover bridges, above the road-dividers, electricity light poles and hoardings. There are uncovered wires hanging loosely in several areas and at many places, the wire joints are lying uncovered, which may cause an accident.

The textile markets located on Ring Road, Sahara Darwaja and Salabatpura have the cobwebs of such hanging wires and cables, threatening the innocent lives of hundreds of people visiting the markets on daily basis.

Champalal Bothra, secretary of Federation of Surat Textile Traders’ Association (FOSTTA), said, “The hanging cables are a real nuisance. When the SMC (Surat Municipal Corporation) is running a campaign in the textile markets for fire safety, it should also consider the serious threat of the hanging wires to the people in the city. Such service providers should be fined for illegally hanging the wires on the public properties and trees.”

Social activist Rajesh Modi has written a letter to the SMC demanding action against the service providers for risking the lives of the pedestrians and two-wheeler riders by hanging the wire illegally on the main thoroughfares and at the traffic junctions. “At many places, these cables are tied on the SMC trees planted in road divider, the SMC light poles or even on the SMC office buildings. Why there is no actions taken by any of the SMC departments. It’s as if taken for granted that anyone can lay such cables across the city without getting any permission and without paying any rent to the SMC,” he said.

“The hanging cables and wires are posing a serious threat to the pedestrians and two-wheeler drivers as the snapping of the wires can result in accidents and deaths,” Modi added.

SMC deputy municipal commissioner N V Upadhyay told TOI: “We are yet to frame any policy regarding the hanging wires and cables in the city. The cables and wires are not in just one area, but across the city. We will have to sit and think about the possible action against those who are risking the lives of the people.”

The new campus is spread over 465 acres of land in Rajgir, about 110km southeast of Patna

PATNA: All the non-residential buildings of Nalanda University (NU) will become fully operational by December next year. The new campus is spread over 465 acres of land in Rajgir, about 110km southeast of Patna.

According to vice-chancellor (VC) Suniana Singh, five of the 17 non-residential buildings, including the academic, administrative, laboratory, teaching and faculty blocks, are already operational.

“There will also be 80 residential buildings that will include the VC’s bungalow, hostels for girls, boys and married couples as well as quarters for teaching and non-teaching employees. As of now, we only provide accommodation to the students enrolled in postgraduate (PG) courses,” the VC said.

At present, NU has altogether 100 students in different postgraduate courses and 650 in diploma and certificate programmes. Almost 60% of them are from Australia, New Zealand, America, Canada and other European countries.

Talking about the facilities on the new campus, Singh said, “We are developing a green and zero waste campus with most areas covered with trees and water bodies. We will also have battery-operated vehicles, organic farms, composting system, cycling tracks, green corridors, shaded walkways as well as waste-to-energy, sewage treatment and solar power plants here.”

Besides, there will be research centres, auditorium, library, incubation centre, sports complex, gym, buildings for various programmes and a common facility centre on NU campus.

The VC said, “The School of Business Management, which will become functional from this academic session, will run an MBA programme in sustainable development and management. Three more centres — Centre for Bay of Bengal, Centre for Conflict Resolution and Peace Building, and Common Archival Resource Centre — will also come up soon.”

Stressing on the need for research centres, Singh pointed out, “At the Centre for Conflict Resolution, which had been envisioned by chief minister Nitish Kumar, scholars will study the conflicts going around in the world and come up with solutions. The Ministry of External Affairs has approved the Common Archival Resource Centre, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had announced the Centre for Bay of Bengal.”

She added that NU would soon be among the top universities.

Presently, NU has four schools — languages and literature/humanities, historical studies, Buddhist studies, philosophy and comparative religions, and environmental studies.

A damaged car after the attack in Ara

ARA/PATNA: CPI functionary and former JNU Students’ Union president Kanhaiya Kumar had a narrow escape when his convoy was pelted with stones near Ara in Bhojpur district on Friday. While two people suffered injuries, a vehicle was damaged in the incident. The injured have been admitted to the sadar hospital at Ara for treatment.

Earlier in the day, Kanhaiya was greeted with black flags in Buxar where he had gone to address an anti-CAA meeting at Quila Maidan. Banners were torn and slogans like ‘Go Back Kanhiaya’ rent the air. This is for the eighth time when his convoy has been attacked in the past 14 days of his month-long ‘Jan Gan Man Yatra’ in different districts of the state.

A group of people started pelting stones at the CPI leader’s convoy near Bibiganj under Gajrajganj police outpost in Bhojpur district when it was proceeding towards Ara from Buxar. Shakeel Ahmad Khan, a former JNU Students’ Union leader, who was accompanying Kanhaiya, said, “We had to abandon the car as it got damaged in the attack. We reached Ara in another vehicle and Kanhaiya addressed the people at Ramna Maidan.”

Bhojpur SP Sushil Kumar said two people were injured in stone pelting. While a youth, who was part of the cavalcade, was wounded while trying to flee after the commotion, another motorcycle-borne youth got injured. We are trying to verify whether the second injured was a trouble maker or part of the cavalcade,” he told this newspaper over phone, adding that two people were detained for interrogation and a motorbike seized.

Meanwhile, addressing the gathering at Ramna Maidan in Ara, Kanhaiya, said, “I have been attacked for the eighth time during my yatra. But I will continue to raise voice against divisive politics till my last breath. We don’t want ‘azadi’ (freedom) from country but from problems plaguing the nation.”

Taking a dig at the Nitish Kumar-led NDA government in the state, Kanhaiya said, “They are diverting the people’s attention from real issues. There is no job and people are migrating from the state in search of job. The students are compelled to complete graduation in five years instead of three years. Moreover, no steps have been taken to make small towns like Ara a tourist destination.”

Girl students outside the Sahjanand Girls Institute on Thursday

RAJKOT: The demaning ordeal that 68 girl students of Shree Sahjanand Girls Institute in Bhuj is a repeat of the infamous 2017 Muzaffarnagar episode, where a warden in a residential school forced around 70 girl students to strip to check for menstrual blood.

The onset of periods practically ostracise the girls like pariahs, a victim told TOI, while talking about the institute’s archaic rules.

The girls in the menstrual cycle have to sign a register in the hostel while going to the basement to stay in ‘quarantine’ for four days

“The basement area is in a pathetic condition with heaps of rubbish strewn everywhere. All girls hesitate to go there as it is not only difficult to live there alone in the dark but is also very frightening at times. We have to sleep on cement slabs, carry our own makeshift bedding and utensils. We cannot go to our room or even meet friends in the common area for dinner or lunch. Kitchen, dining area and place of worship were totally out of bounds for these girls, which often make many sink into severe depression,” she said, her voice quivering from the trauma.

That’s not all. In the final assault, these quarantine girls are also not allowed to attend the general assembly or sit in the classrooms like normal days. The ‘outcasts’ have to strictly occupy the back benches only.

And it’s a vicious monthly cycle till they graduate and leave the institute finally.

“It was sheer mental torture and we don’t have words to describe it,” said the victim, who claims that the Monday backlash was actually an outcome of the authorities suppressed anger of not finding a few names for a lengthy period of time in the basement register. The discovery of a soiled sanitary pad in the garden outside the hostel on Monday was just the trigger point, she added.

59,['15/02/2020'],Telco distress call: SBI says it’s prepared for the worst,"(File photo)

MUMBAI: State Bank of India (SBI) chairman Rajnish Kumar on Friday said the bank was prepared for the worst following the Supreme Court order asking telecom companies to immediately pay adjusted gross revenue (AGR) dues to the government. SBI has Rs 29,000-crore loan exposure to telecom, the largest among Indian banks.Shares of SBI fell 8%, while other lenders with large exposure to telcos like Yes Bank and IndusInd Bank also dropped up to 5% on Friday. Analysts fear that the SC order could lead to a Vodafone Idea shutdown. “It may result in Rs 1.2-lakh-crore debt default, large-scale job losses and subscriber churn,” said Motilal Oswal in a report.Addressing reporters on the sidelines of the Nasscom Software summit here, Kumar said: “Our exposure to them is Rs 29,000 crore. After this order we will ask them what their plans are to comply with the order and whatever is the situation, we are capable of handling it.” He added that he expected the telcos to have identified “a course of action” as the order was known for some time.So far, SBI has provided only for non-performing assets (NPAs) in its telecom loans. “We had NPAs of about Rs 9,000 crore and there is recovery expected there. On the standard assets, we did not feel the need to provide,” said Kumar. Besides the loans, SBI has an additional Rs 14,000 crore of non-fund exposure, which includes guarantees to the government, where the telcos have not defaulted.“It is now for the telecom companies to decide how to find the money or what course of action they will take,” said Kumar. Analysts had earlier expected that the government would provide relief to the telcos. The Centre is counting on Rs 90,000 crore of spectrum dues from Vodafone, which in turn owes banks Rs 30,000 crore. Given that the promoter’s investment in the company is Rs 15,000 crore there is a likelihood that Vodafone and Aditya Birla group will walk away.In December last year, Aditya Birla Group chairman Kumar Mangalam Birla had said that Vodafone Idea may have to shut down if there is no relief in the statutory dues. If Vodafone shuts shop, it is seen to benefit Reliance Jio and Airtel. “Bharti is relatively well placed considering Rs 18,800-crore cash on books and its ability to raise requisite capital. In the absence of any government support, we see this market heading towards a duopoly, which is likely to boost Bharti’s market share,” said Sandip Agarwal of Edelweiss Research.Last month, India Ratings had downgraded Vodafone India from ‘IND BBB-’ from ‘IND BBB’ and retained on rating watch with negative implications. “The downgrade reflects the crystallisation of adjusted gross revenue related liabilities for Vodafone Idea after the Supreme Court’s adverse ruling on January 16, 2020, dismissing the review petition filed by telcos. The SC ruling provides clarity on the liabilities that are payable by Vodafone Idea to the department of telecommunications, which was earlier contingent upon the outcome of the review petition,” said Priyanka Bansal, senior analyst with India Ratings after the January 16 decision.",business,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74146689,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-643974,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/telco-distress-call-sbi-says-its-prepared-for-the-worst/articleshow/74143453.cms

KOLKATA: An elderly Hindusthan Park resident who had lost her cabin baggage that had gold and diamond jewellery worth Rs 5 lakh at Kolkata airport last week got the bag back — with the valuables intact — on Thursday night after cops and airline officials tracked the man from CCTV footage who had “accidentally” picked it up and had taken a flight to Silchar. They convinced him to come back and return the woman’s luggage.

Jayalakhsmi Chatterjee, cops said, verified that the bag was still sealed and all the ornaments were in place.

According to cops, the woman was about to board an IndiGo flight to Hyderabad with two bags on February 6. She was placing one bag at the manual X-ray machine when she suddenly realized the small metallic blue trolley she had placed by her side was missing. “She had alerted the airline staff and CISF officials, who began a search but couldn’t locate the missing bag. By the time they managed to locate the man, they realized he had already taken a flight to Assam. The woman subsequently left for Hyderabad. She lodged an official missing complaint after returning to the city on February 9,” said an official of NSCBI airport police station.

Meanwhile, assistant SI Suraj Dutta and two officials of IndiGo’s vigilance team — Biswadip Bose and Ayan Saha — contacted the man, Upendra Sahu. However, he had already gone home to the Nagaon district, around 200km from Silchar. “The man said he had come to Kolkata to attend a wedding and had accidentally picked up the bag while heading home with relatives. We were in touch with him over all these days. He informed us that he was coming to the city on Thursday and would be coming with the woman’s bag,” said the official.

On Thursday evening, officers received him at the airport and escorted him to the police station, where Sahu returned the bag to Chatterjee in presence of senior officers.

“The woman checked the contents of the bag and was sure that nothing was missing,” the official said.

APIs for manufacturing cardio-vascular, diabetes, antibiotics, anti-infectives and vitamins are imported, while for certain APIs, dependence on China is around 80-90%.A similar directive was issued for agriculture shipments from China, and sent to importers, exporters and plant quarantine offices nationwide on February 5.“We are planning to ask the government to have the samples inspected and tested in laboratories, or get them cleared by agencies (like Indian Council of Medical Research) to rule out any contamination,” an IDMA official told TOI, adding, a final decision is yet to be taken.Most pharma ingredients and intermediates imported from China are produced in Hubei province or adjoining areas, while Wuhan , Hubei’s capital, is the epicentre of the outbreak. If the production stoppage prolongs in regions like Hubei, it would have an impact on Indian industry, with a possible spike in prices, and shortages. Last week, Cipla and Lupin top management said after their earnings’ call that they have stocks available for two-three months.Due to panic and ""speculative buying"", bulk drug prices of Paracetamol, Penicillin, cardio-vascular and diabetes have reportedly started rising from January.""At the moment, we haven’t seen any major disruption in API supplies due to Coronavirus outbreak in China. Supply has been impacted for few API products and we are closely monitoring the situation. We have sufficient inventory of API and raw materials for the short term,” a Sun Pharma spokesperson said.",business,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74148584,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-95416,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/indian-pharma-cos-want-chinese-imports-tested/articleshow/74143495.cms

MUMBAI: The country’s construction, auto, chemicals and pharma sectors are expected to be the worst affected due to COVID-19 , which carries the risk of global supply chain disruptions. Five import items that are heavily dependant on China -- electrical machinery, machinery and mechanical appliances, organic chemicals, plastics and optical & surgical instruments -- that make up about 28% of India’s import basket could be hit the most due to a potential shutdown, analysts say.As a result, construction, transport, chemicals and machinery manufacturing could be affected, though the overall impact of COVID-19 on India’s trade is expected to be modest. There may not be much impact on the country’s exports as China accounts for just 5% of the country’s total outgo, but certain commodities like organic chemicals and cotton could face headwinds as they have a sizeable share in exports.China accounted for around $73 billion, or 14%, of India’s total imports of $507 billion in FY18. China is the biggest source for imports, though its contribution to India’s total imports is less than one-seventh. The coronavirus is likely to keep factories and industrial hubs in China closed beyond February 17 when the Lunar new year holidays end until the epidemic is brought under control, leading to extensive potential production losses.Among imports, organic chemicals is likely to be among the worst-affected commodities due to the crisis. India imports close to 40% of its organic chemicals from China, while other sources — US and Singapore, also depend on China to varying degrees, says a note from ICICI Securities.India also imports 40% of its electrical machinery from mainland China, and with Hong Kong, its share goes up to 57%. Over half of India’s electrical machinery imports are likely to get impacted. Further, India imports almost one-third of its machinery and mechanical appliances from China, and a prolonged shutdown is likely to put 30-40% of machinery imports at risk.For optical and surgical instruments, China is the largest supplier with a 16% share, hence these could be also impacted. Around 54% of India’s import basket is dependent on China — of which 28% is heavily dependent, and the remaining 26% has modest dependence. Import items among the 26% include iron, steel and inorganic chemicals. Plastics are also likely to be hit, although at a lower extent.Domestic pharma companies could also face disruption if the crisis extends beyond three to four months, as key raw materials (active pharmaceutical ingredients — APIs) and intermediates are imported from China. For certain API used for anti-infectives, antibiotics, vitamins, anti-diabetes, dependence on China is 80-90%, industry experts say.",business,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74145467,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-127626,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/virus-may-hit-28-indian-imports/articleshow/74143474.cms

Representative image

PATNA: Bihar was conferred with the ‘ Best State Award 2020 ’ on Friday under the India Poultry Awards 2020 category for achieving excellence in egg production with spectacular growth rate of 44.72% in the last three fiscals, four times the national average, animal husbandry and fishery resources (AHFRD) said on Friday.

AHFRD principal secretary N Vijaya Lakshmi received the award at a function held in Delhi. The organisers of the award rated Bihar’s achievements made in the poultry sector as the “mega success story”.

The department maintained that while Bihar with over 88% of people dependent on agriculture sector had been the consumer state in the non-agriculture produce like eggs and fish, spectacular growth achieved in the last three fiscals had changed the scene.

The projected growth rate for the current 2019-20 fiscal over the previous one is estimated to be 50.57% at 265 crore of egg production, while in fish production the gap between the import from the state like Andhra Pradesh and local production in Bihar has also been drastically narrowed, AHFRD added.

Egg production in the state was 100 crore in 2015-16, followed by 111 crore in 2016-17 fiscal, 122 crore in 2017-18 and 176 crore in 2018-19. The leap in the egg production growth rate has been whopping 65% in 2018-19.

As a matter of fact, remarkable growth rate has been witnessed in all the segments of non-agriculture produce in the last three fiscals – like egg production (65%), meat (19.63%), fish (18.47%) and milk (17.43%), the AHFRD said, adding that the livestock production constituted 36% of the overall contribution by the agriculture sector to the gross state domestic product (GSDP). While the sector has gone a long way in poverty reduction in the state, it has also created self-employment opportunities for the people concerned.

PATNA: Incarcerated RJD chief Lalu Prasad’s elder son Tej Pratap Yadav , who had embarrassed his party by raising questions over distribution of tickets in 2019 general elections, seems to be determined to work with his younger brother Tejashwi Prasad Yadav ahead of the upcoming assembly elections in the state.

Tej released a poster on Thursday with a punch line ‘Tej raftar, Tejashwi sarkar’. “Tej raftar badhana aur Tejashwi ko mukhyamatri banana hai,” Tej said at the poster launch event at his official residence on Strand Road here. “We are ready for mission 2020 and our target is to form government of poor people,” he added.”

Speaking at another public meeting at Bihta on Thursday, Tej said all RJD workers should unite to make Tejashwi the next CM of the state. “This is our concept and we will move ahead with this while organizing various programmes ahead of the election,” he said.

Tej was health minister in Mahagathbandhan government headed by chief minister Nitish Kumar from November 2015 to July 2017. Though he has claimed on numerous occasions that Tejashwi is his ‘Arjun’ and he is ‘Krishna’, Tej also left his party red-faced on many occasions during and after the 2019 general election.

Tej had fielded two of his own candidates as independents in two parliamentary constituencies – Jehanabad and Sheohar. However, the nomination papers of his choice for Sheohar seat were rejected on technical grounds. Later, JD(U) candidate won from Jehanabad constituency by a margin of little over 1,000 votes.

Days after the announcements of results of the Lok Sabha election, Tej wrote to Tejashwi in May, stating that those who distributed tickets and the candidates should take the responsibility for the poll debacle.

Over the next few months, the elder Yadav scion kept floating different outfits, such as ‘Tej Sena’ and ‘Lalu-Rabri Morcha’, which led to rumours about him trying to distance himself with Tejashwi. However, none of these outfits is working on the ground. The latest in the series is ‘Lalu Prasad Brigade’, the logo of which was seen on the poster released by Tej Pratap on Thursday.

Political observers said by launching the new poster in support of Tejashwi, Tej is trying to send out the message that all is well in the family, especially among the two brothers.

Tej also attacked CM Nitish Kumar while launching the poster. “Aapki palti mari Se trast hai Bihar, ab Bihariyo ko chahiye tej raftar Tejashwi sarkar,” Tej tweeted on Thursday.

66,['15/02/2020'],Prepare DPRs for Ashok Rajpath and Karbigahiya elevated roads: Minister,"This story is from February 15, 2020

PATNA: The city is set to get a major infrastructure boost with the road construction department (RCD) on Friday approving preparation of detailed project report (DPR) for the proposed nearly three-km-long elevated road between Kargil Chowk and NIT Mor on Ashok Rajpath .

A decision in this regard was taken at a meeting convened by road construction minister Nand Kishor Yadav to review some major projects of Bihar Rajya Pul Nirman Nigam Limited (BRPNNL).

The road construction department has also approved preparation of DPRs for another elevated road – Karbigahiya to Old Bypass Road – and a four-lane bridge over the Falgu river in Gaya.

“The proposed four-lane elevated road is aimed at decongesting the vehicular movement on Ashok Rajpath. The road will be constructed with an estimated expenditure of Rs 300 crore,” the RCD minister told TOI.

Ashok Rajpath is one of the busiest streets in the city with several major establishments, including Patna Medical College and Hospital (PMCH) and Patna University along it. Besides, there are hundreds of shops and commercial establishments, leading to movement of tens of hundreds of vehicles on the road throughout the day. Encroachments on the road and illegal parking aggravate traffic problem on the road.

The state government has also proposed to construct metro rail line on Ashok Rajpath under the 14.45km north-south corridor (proposed ISBT-Rajendra Nagar Terminal- Ashok Rajpath-Gandhi Maidan-Dak Bungalow Crossing-Patna Junction) in the metro project.

The minister said feedback and suggestions will be taken from state urban development and housing department (UDHD) for construction of the elevated road on this stretch.

Ashok Rajpath apart, the RCD minister said another four-lane elevated road from Karbigahiya to Old Bypass Road will ease vehicular movement for commuters going from Karbigahiya end of Patna Junction to Kankerbagh.

“Only one-way vehicular movement is allowed on the existing railway overbridge (ROB) at Karbigahiya at present, for vehicles going from Old Bypass Road towards Karbigahiya. However, with the construction of the 960-metre-long elevated road, vehicles will move smoothly from the opposite direction as well,” the minister said.

He added that a proposal for a bridge parallel to J P Setu was also reviewed in the meeting. The minister said work on R-Block-Beerchand Patel Marg flyover will be completed soon. The project entails an expenditure of Rs 118 crore.

Surat: Officials of the Surat Municipal Corporation’s (SMC) BRTS cell are on their toes these days.

Following the threat by Hemali Boghawala, chairman of public transport committee of the SMC over non-operational automatic swing gates in the BRTS corridors, the cell has repaired about 13 gates, which were non-operational for the last six months, in just two days.

Bhogiwala had threatened to sit in the office 24x7 until the swing gates become functional again. Majority of the swing gates are non-operational in the corridors located at Pandesara, Udhana, Bhestan, Parvat Patia, Varachha, Kamrej etc.

Boghiwala said despite several reminders to the officials over the past six months, about 38 gates are non-operational.

Talking with TOI, Boghawala said, “I inspected the swing gate at the Pandesara BRTS corridor on Wednesday and they were not working. I immediately summoned the officials on the site and asked them to repair the gate or else I would in the corridor for the whole day. The gate was repaied in just an hour.”

Boghawala added, “If one swing gate could be made operational in an hour, I thought of sitting in the office for 24 hours to get 24 swing gates operational. Due to the non-operational swing gates, motorists are driving in the BRTS corridor without fear and the accident cases are rising.”

Official sources said that there are a total of 276 swing gates installed in the 19 BRT corridors across the city. In the last six months, 38 got damaged due to various reasons.

“Mumbai-based company which has got the contract to maintain these swing gates was given at least 18 notices in the last seven months. Recently, the company was served another notice warning of termination of the contract after which it started repairing the gates,” said executive engineer of BRTS cell, DR Gohil.

Shivraj SIngh Chouhan in Sausar on Saturday

Bhopal: Amid war of words on social media between former chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan and CM Kamal Nath’s son Nakul Nath over alleged demolition of Chhattrapati Shivaji bust in Sausar town of Chhindwara, Chouhan took out a protest march in Sausar town on Saturday.

Chouhan took out a march and later paid tributes at the place where the statue was installed. Speaking on the occasion, Chouhan slammed the Kamal Nath government and warned, “I will not keep quiet whenever the government tries to disrespect important personalities of our nation. If need be we will shed our blood for the honour of people like Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj. His bust was razed, hurting our national pride.”

It may be noted that a couple of days ago, a platform for installing a bust of Chhatrapati Shivaji was set up by some locals in Sausar town. Subsequently, the civic body officials razed it triggering protests. Later, the district administration officials assured the locals that the statue would be installed as per norms.

Chouhan had announced on Twitter on Friday that he will visit Chhindwara and lend support to the protestors, while Nakul Nath welcomed him in Chhindwara asked him not to return without seeing the “Chhindwara model” of development.

Chouhan had tweeted, ""Tomorrow (Saturday) I am reaching Sausar at 2 o'clock in the afternoon. I call upon the people to join me and together we can tell Kamal Nathji loud and clear, chanting `Chhatrpati Shivaji Maharaj Ki Jai' that how our roar resonates from Sausar to Bhopal."" Thereafter, Congress MP from Chhindwara and chief minister Kamal Nath’s son Nakul Nath tweeted that he will welcome Chouhan to his hometown Chhindwara, but regretted that Shivraj is visiting Chhindwara with a motive to get political mileage in the name of Chhatarapti Shivaji.

Inviting him for lunch at his Shikarpur residence on the outskirts of Chhindwara town, Nakul Nath said he would request Chouhan to take a look at the entire Chhindwara town and its development model before going back, said Nakul Nath in another tweet. In his third tweet over the issue, Nakul said he would get the bust made himself and re-install it at Mohgaon trisection at a grand ceremony and would bear the entire cost himself.

76,['15/02/2020'],"In a first, MP shows way, radio-tags two pangolins","This story is from February 15, 2020

Nagpur: Even as various bodies observed ‘World Pangolin Day’ on February 14, Madhya Pradesh led the way in conservation of the species with world’s first radio-tagged Indian pangolins.

MP has tagged two pangolins rescued from poachers and has rehabilitated them in Satpura Tiger Reserve in Hoshangabad and is successfully monitoring them for the last 3-4 months.

Pangolins, listed under Schedule I of the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972 and have equal protection like tigers, are most trafficked mammals for their scales. These nocturnal mammals are virtually on the verge of extinction.

Pangolin, the scaly anteater, is targeted for its scales used in traditional Chinese medicines, and meat consumed as a delicacy in many Asian countries. A study by global NGO TRAFFIC for a period 2009-2017 had found nearly 6,000 pangolins in illegal wildlife trade in India. However, this was a conservative estimate as only a fraction of illegal wildlife trade is detected and actual numbers is likely to be higher.

Ritesh Sirothia, in-charge of special task force (STF), MP, says, “Since 2015, 11 cases have been registered against pangolin poachers and 164 persons have been arrested from 12 states.”

Globally, pangolins are considered the most trafficked wild mammals and most of the poaching and smuggling across pangolin range countries is targeted for international markets in China and Southeast Asia.

Now, a joint project by MP forest department and Wildlife Conservation Trust (WCT) has been initiated to understand ecology of Indian pangolins and develop an effective conservation plan. The project involves challenging task of radio-tagging and monitoring this endangered species apart from many other activities.

The fieldwork is supported by Yes Bank under its CSR initiative. MP announced successful radio-tagging of world’s first-ever Indian pangolins from Satpura tiger reserve & biosphere reserve.

“The STF has been actively working to curb wildlife poaching in the state. In recent years, we have successfully busted pangolin smuggling syndicates which involved poachers and smugglers from 12 states,” said Rajesh Shrivastav, MP chief wildlife warden.

“The team has successfully rehabilitated two Indian pangolins in the wild. This is the first-ever case of successful rehabilitation effort of the species where released individuals are monitored in wild using telemetry to ensure better success rate,” said SK Singh, field director of Satpura.

Pangolins evolved scales as a means of protection and this unique protection mechanism has now become its main cause of disappearance. Globally, pangolins have seen a rapid reduction in population. The projected population declines range from 50% to 80 % across the genus.

Out of the eight species of pangolin, Indian pangolin and the Chinese pangolin are found in India. The Chinese pangolin has a distribution in northeast India while the Indian pangolin is distributed widely in India except the extreme arid zones — Himalayas and the northeast.

Indian pangolin has been reported from India, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh and Pakistan. Despite protective measures, pangolins in India are widely exploited and traded both domestically and internationally.

Shrivastav said being an elusive nocturnal species occurring at low densities, there is very little information available on the behaviour and ecology of the Indian pangolin. It is critical to know the ecology of the species to develop an effective conservation plan for an endangered species.

“In anti-poaching operations where pangolin scales are recovered, those animals are already dead. Where live pangolins are involved, globally there is about 50% death-rate among released pangolins,” he adds.

“Given that several pangolins are rescued in central Indian landscape, the new initiative by MP & WCT is to ensure better survival rates of these released individuals in the wild and thus have a positive impact on population of this endangered species,” said Aditya Joshi, wildlife biologist with WCT, who is overseeing the project.

World Pangolin Day, celebrated world over on third Saturday in February, is an attempt to raise awareness about pangolins and bring together various stakeholders to help protect these unique species from extinction.

Gangster Vikrant Yadav

JAIPUR: Bhiwadi police ‘ruined’ the Valentine’s Day plans of wanted gangster by arresting him when he was out for shopping with his girlfriend in Delhi on Thursday. The accused was wanted in the murder of BSP leader Jasram Gujjar in Behror last year.

The wanted gangster was identified as 33-year-old Vikrant Yadav who had Rs 30,000 reward on his arrest by Haryana and Rajasthan police .

SP Bhiwadi, Amandeep Kapoor told TOI, “The accused was on the run since Gujjar’s murder last year in July. He would keep changing his locations frequently and travelled through various states including MP, UP, Haryana, Punjab, Rajasthan and others. A team was constituted to track down the accused and police officials also went to many states to catch him. He was spotted in Delhi’s Connaught Place where he was shopping for Valentine’s Day with his girlfriend on Thursday.”

Following this the cops got close to the accused who got a hint of police presence and tried to flee but was arrested. He was also involved in the firing at a dairy in Behror when the owner had refused to give ‘protection money’ last year. During the time when he was on the run, Yadav also made extortion calls to traders and transporters demanding Rs 1 crore from them.

He never used mobile numbers to make calls but instead used other forms like WhatsApp calling which is untraceable. He also changed his phones regularly which made it difficult to pinpoint his exact location. Yadav is part of Vikram Laden’s gang who was arrested last month from Hyderabad. They would induct minors into their gang by posting photographs with weapons on social media and would make the youngsters do their dirty work while themselves remain in the background.

Yadav has multiple criminal cases against him in Rajasthan and Haryana.

Kottayam: A 32-year-old woman on Friday transferred the ownership of a house in five cents to a man, whose son had allegedly killed her father 12 years ago.

Naisy Kalayil, employed with a Bengaluru-based private firm, handed over the documents of the property in Thalayolaparambu to Vasu, father of Aneesh, who had allegedly murdered her father Kalayil Mathew in 2008 .

The property originally belonged to Vasu, but Aneesh had pledged it to Mathew, a private moneylender, for availing a loan of Rs 1 lakh.

Mathew attached the property after changing its ownership in his name after Aneesh had failed to repay the amount.

Mathew later went missing in 2008, and his family had no information about him until Naisy received a phone call from Vasu in 2016.

Naisy recorded the phone conversation in which Vasu said his son Aneesh had murdered Mathew in 2008. Based on the revelation, the woman lodged a police complaint.

During investigation, Aneesh reportedly told the police that Mathew’s body was buried where a three-storey shopping complex was later constructed. Investigators soon found the skeletal remains, and arrested Aneesh.

“It was Aneesh who had committed the crime and not his family. Moreover, I came to know about the death of my father through Vasu,” Naisy said, adding that Aneesh’s family had struggled much to buy the land to build the house.

Naisy had come home to Thalayolaparambu specifically to complete the official procedures and hand over the property.

Dehradun: Structures of five shops in the city’s Prem Nagar market collapsed on Friday. The shops were standing on temporary structures and were at a height of around 10-feet above the road height, shopkeepers in the area told TOI.

“There is always an element of risk for such shops as their structures are temporary. On Wednesday, a house located on the same stretch had also collapsed. Several sanitation workers were living in the building but thankfully, no one got hurt. The members of the trade union will soon meet the administration regarding the safety of shops in the area,” said Rajeev Punj, president of Prem Nagar’s Vyapar Mandal.

Notably, the district administration had conducted a massive anti-encroachment drive on the same stretch in Prem Nagar in September, 2018. During the drive, several shops were demolished but they resurfaced again with temporary structures some time later.

Kochi: India meteorological department (IMD) warned that Alappuzha, Kottayam, Kannur and Kasaragod were likely to be hotter on Saturday as temperatures were likely to rise by 2C-4C. The weather was very dry in Kerala as temperatures soared in many districts including Thiruvananthapuram, Alappuzha (37.3°C), Kannur and Kottayam (37°C) on Friday. Cochin airport recorded 36.8°C.

However, there was no large change in the minimum temperature in Kerala during the past 24 hours. Punalur reported the lowest temperature at 20°C.

Kerala state disaster management authority (KSDMA) asked people to take proper precautions during daytime in districts with higher temperatures. KSDMA said that the temperature recorded in January and February were among the highest recorded in recent years; the temperature was above 37°C in many parts of the state. KSDMA issued an advisory asking people to be vigilant while dealing with health problems as temperature was rising each day.

Temperatures had crossed 36°C in many places since February 10 including Cochin airport, Kottayam, Punalur, Alappuzha, Kannur and Thiruvananthapuram. “We missed our winter this year and it seems summer season has moved to February itself,” said S Abhilash, joint director, ST Radar Centre, Cusat.

Schools have been asked to ensure drinking water in classrooms. Elder persons, pregnant women, children, and those suffering from other ailments should avoid noon heat from 11am to 3pm.

Private weathercaster Skymet said that Kerala was heating up much before the rest of the country for the past few years. The region saw multiple locations reporting maximum temperatures much above the 30-degree mark in the month of February.

It said that relief might come in the form of isolated rain from February 19- 21 due to elevated temperatures and peak humidity. Above-normal temperatures (up by 1.6°C-3°C) will be seen in Tamil Nadu, Puducherry and south interior Karnataka.

Thiruvananthapuram: State information commission imposed a fine of Rs 3,000 on an official in the secretariat for denying information to application on unacceptable grounds.

Chief information commissioner Vinson M Paul slapped the fine on L T Santhosh Kumar, an official attached to the general administration department, who refused to give information on an application submitted by former MLA Joseph M Puthussery, seeking some details regarding DGP Jacob Thomas.

Puthussery had sought information on whether Thomas had the prior permission of the government before taking classes at Kollam T K M Engineering college.

His application, said Puthussery, was rejected by the official on the ground that such personal information could not be given as per RTI Act. The order by the information commissioner said the information sought was part of the official records and the reason cited by the officer in the rank of undersecretary was not acceptable. The lapse, said the commission, could not be considered an inadvertent one and hence the penalty.

The application was given in October 2016 and the reply was given in November. According to Puthussery, the officer denied information as Thomas was in the good books of the government during that period. His similar applications addressed to chief minister and chief secretary too did not elicit any reply, he said.

Jaipur: Facing steep competition from countries like Bangladesh, Pakistan, and Vietnam on one hand and withdrawal of Merchandise Exports Incentive Scheme (MEIS) benefits by the Centre on the other, the readymade garment exporters in the state have appealed to the state government to address their difficulties in the state budget to overcome the slump in shipments.

In their recommendations, they also urged the government to bring in a separate policy for readymade garments, decoupling it from textile industry. Rajeev Diwan, president of the Garment Exporters Association of Rajasthan (GEAR) said that demand dip in exporting countries, withdrawal of MEIS benefits and intense competition from Bangladesh, Pakistan, and Vietnam have clouded the outlook of garment exports.

“We have apprised the state government of the difficult business environment the garment exporters are in and sought some helping hand to ride out the phase. Access to credit at lower interest rates, compensating for the loss of MEIS benefits and power at reduced cost are some of the areas where the state can help the industry. We expect the chief minister to announce some incentives to the sector in the state budget,” Diwan said.

Besides, the industry body is also pitching for a separate policy for garments. Currently, the sector is coupled with textile policy. “The requirements of garment or apparel industry is entirely different from that of the textile industry in terms of technology, cost, and infrastructural needs. Being the end-users of the manufactured products of the textile sector, the apparel industry gets only indirect benefits of the policy. That’s why we want a specific policy in consideration of our unique operational needs,” Diwan added.

The garment exporters urged the state government to impress upon the finance ministry at the Centre to facilitate financing against government receivables from banks at benchmark rates with low margins of about 10% without any restriction on the tenor.

“Credit conditions have tightened because of multiple reasons known to everybody. But there are ways that can be explored for reducing the rates for garment exporters,” Diwan said. Readymade garments, along with textiles, gems and jewellery, engineering goods, chemical products and handicrafts, is among the five items from Rajasthan that account for nearly two-thirds of exports. Garments contribute about 5% to the state’s total exports.

Chennai: Former transport minister and Aravakurichi MLA V Senthil Balaji , who shifted allegiance from the AIADMK to the DMK, on Friday appeared before the cybercrime wing police at the commissioner’s office in connection with the job recruitment scam in which he is an accused.

He was questioned for about an hour. Speaking to reporters after the inquiry, Senthil Balaji said the case was politically motivated and that he was ready to appear before the investigators anytime.

City police had conducted searches at more than 17 places in connection with the job racket scam, including Senthil Balaji’s house in Mandaveli. CCB began reinvestigating the case in November last year after the Madras high court ordered the case be reprobed.

The case pertains to as many as 81 people being defrauded to the tune of Rs 4 crore promising them jobs in the state transport department in 2015, when Senthil Balaji held the portfolio.

Dharmapuri: On Valentine’s Day, a 23-year-old man hanged to death after a college lecturer rebuked him for coming to the college to spend time with his lover.

Infuriated, kin of the deceased protested outside the lecturer’s house in Bedarahalli village near Indur with the dead body, demanding criminal action against him.

The Indur police identified the deceased as S Navin, of Makkanur village. A BSc graduate, he was in search of a job.

A police officer said Navin was in love with a girl, who was studying third-year BA at the Government Arts and Science College in Pennagaram.

“On Valentine’s Day, Navin went to meet her in the college. While they were talking, guest lecturer Gopi, 35, noticed them and chided Navin. He also grabbed Navin’s mobile phone and threw away,” the officer said.

Navin felt insulted as the entire episode took place in front of his lover and he left for home. His father Selva Kumar said, “My son was really upset, and he had narrated the entire incident to me. He went to his room and did not come out since afternoon. Later in the evening, he committed suicide by hanging from the ceiling of the house.”

Selva Kumar and other family members retrieved the body and took it to the lecturer’s house, where they raised slogans against him.

When alerted, the Indur police pacified the kin of the deceased and sent the body to the government medical college hospital in Dharmapuri for postmortem.

Police have registered a case and further inquiry is on.

Thiruvananthapuram: Following post-budget discussion where concerns regarding the neglect of capital city were raised, finance minister T M Thomas Isaac announced additional projects for the city. One among the new proposals will cheer up bicycle enthusiasts and proponents of green living. Project for an exclusive bicycle track on the Pipeline Road has been earmarked Rs 1.5 crore. The track will come up on the 3km stretch from Kowdiar to Vazhayila.

Vehicular movement on the Pipeline Road, which is owned by the Kerala water authority (KWA), is restricted to ensure the protection of transmission pipelines laid beneath it. Now, the public works department (PWD) is planning to lay interlocking tiles to make it useful to bicycle riders.

MLA V K Prasanth announced the proposal in his social media page on Friday. When contacted, the MLA said that PWD will prepare the project report. “The cycle track will be helpful for all bicycle riders who do not have any such facility in the city now,” he said.

Officials of the PWD said that funding was a major hurdle for the proposal, which has been cleared now. “We have not been given any intimation about allocation of funds. However, if the budget has earmarked fund, then we can prepare the detailed project report (DPR) immediately and submit the estimate. This road could be readied for bicycle riders by laying interlocking tiles. The tiles can be laid without disrupting the transmission lines beneath the road. Currently, people living on the sides of Pipeline Road complain about the uneven road surface, which gets waterlogged during rains,” the PWD official said, adding that they will send a request to KWA to hand over land, which could be returned after laying the tiles.

Meanwhile, officials of KWA said that they haven’t got any direction for handing over the area for the work. “We will take steps to ensure that only cycles ply on the road. Proper barricading and fencing should be ensured to prevent entry of other vehicles, as it could damage the underground transmission pipes,” said a KWA official.

The bicycle enthusiasts in the city are highly appreciative of the proposal. City’s bicycle mayor Prakash P Gopinath said that the exclusive cycle track will be a good option for bicycle riders in the city. “The Kowdiar-Vazhayila stretch can be used by cycle riders for a fun ride to Aruvikkara,” he said.

In addition to this, a cycle track is being mooted under the Smart City project, which is expected to come up in the Manaveeyam-Vazhuthacaud-Music College stretch. Rs 22 crore has been earmarked for the non-motorized transport project, which involves construction of cycle track and footpath over the utility duct.

CHENNAI: Concerned at the amount of raw sewage flowing into the city’s three main water bodies, the government in its budget presented on Friday allocated Rs 1,370 crore for river restoration that will mainly focus on cleaning up the various drains.A Chennai River Restoration Trust (CRRT) official said the Adyar river had the most number of drains, 23, including the Mambalam canal, followed by the Buckingham canal with 21, while the Cooum river had just eight.The project will cover Captain Cotton Canal, Otteri Nullah, Virugambakkam Canal, Veerangal Odai among others, all of which currently carry large amounts of untreated sewage, some of them travelling distances of up to 10 km before draining into a river or a larger canal, said the official.The restoration will mainly consist of improving the hydrology of the drains and enhancing their flood-carrying capacity to ensure clean water eventually reaches the rivers, he said.As part of the waterfront development, the Public Works Department (PWD) or Greater Chennai Corporation, depending upon the ownership of the water body, will remove solid waste, construct compound walls or put up chain link fences and plant saplings along the bunds. The work will also involve interception and diversion of sewage outfalls. As far as the sewage outfalls, Metrowater is executing the work of intercepting and diverting the sewage, the official added.The CRRT will prepare a detailed project report (DPR) for the project.There is also the human element to the restoration project — the contentious rehabilitation component which will involve removing hundreds of people from the banks of rivers and moving them into tenements in resettlement colonies, often several km from their workplaces.Such ‘evictions’ have on many occasions sparked acrimony, with activists alleging that the government takes up such schemes without adequate consultations with stakeholders. The process almost always ends in the slum dwellers being denied proper means of livelihood and having to commute huge distances daily, they say. The government had made an announcement in this regard last year. A Tamil Nadu Slum Clearance Board (TNSCB) official said a total of 60,000 people living along the river banks are set to be rehabilitated under the scheme. The TNSCB, tasked with identifying the people to be relocated, had submitted to the government a proposal, saying an estimated Rs 4,647 crore would be required to build more slum tenements under the project.

Coimbatore: BJP on Friday requested the state government to construct a stupa at RS Puram in memory of the victims of the Coimbatore serial bomb blasts.

According to police, more than 10,000 cadres of BJP, Vishva Hindu Parishad and Hindu Munnani participated in a rally from Bharathi Park to DB Road junction seeking support for the Citizenship Amendment Act and to observe the 22nd anniversary of the blasts. The functionaries paid floral tributes to the blast victims, slain Hindu Munnani leader Sasikumar and sub-inspector Wilson.

As many as 58 people were killed and more than 1,000 people suffered injuries in the blasts in 1998, BJP leader Pon Radhakrishnan said. “We wish to pay floral tributes to the victims of the bomb blasts at the memorial stupa next year. The state government should take necessary steps to construct it,” he said.

Islamic terrorist organisations that murdered several Hindu leaders since 1980 were behind the serial bomb blasts, Radhakrishnan said. “One such extremist organization killed sub-inspector Wilson at Kaliyakkavilai in Kanyakumari district. The perpetrators were out on bail. The state government should make sure that extremists do not to come out of prisons.”

BJP and other Hindu outfits had been paying floral tributes to the blasts victims at RS Puram for the last 21 years, the senior leader said. “Police used to deny permission to conduct the event and arrest the participants. But the state government granted permission to conduct the event at RS Puram for the first time this year,” he said.

DMK chief M K Stalin is lying when he says that he had collected two crore signatures against CAA, Radhakrishnan said. “How can a party obtain two crore signatures within such a short period?”

Later, addressing party functionaries at RS Puram, he said that some political parties are conducting protests against CAA to gain mileage out of it. “Muslims should not trust DMK. If 15 % of Muslims come out to protest against CAA, 80% of Hindus will also come out to support it.”

BJP state secretary KT Ragavan, state general secretary Vanathi Srinivasan, district president R Nandakumar, Hindu Munnani state president Kadeswara Subramaniam, state secretary Kishor Kumar and VHP state organiser P M Nagarajan attended the rally.

As many as 3,100 police personnel were deployed in the city to maintain law and order in view of the rally.

JAIPUR: Poaching incidents appear to be going unprecedented in the tiger reserves across Rajasthan and just a day after two poachers were arrested whose images were captured in a trap camera after they hunted a Cheetal (spotted deer) in Ranthambore Tiger Reserve (RTR), two more were arrested in Sariska Tiger Reserve on Friday for hunting two hares.

The two arrested were identified as Rahul Bawariya and Radheshyam Bawariya. Officials also recovered the country-made weapon which was used for shooting the wild animal.

Seduram Yadav told TOI, “We received information on Friday that the accused had hunted the animal in the reserve. We immediately started an investigation and on the same day both the accused were arrested. The weapon was also recovered.” A case was registered against them under the Wildlife Protection Act 1972 which prohibits hunting and poaching of wild animals. With recent increase in the cases of poaching in the tiger reserves across the state, wildlife enthusiasts have also raised questions on the safety of the tigers in Rajasthan. Babulal Jaju, state incharge, People for Animal, an organisation working for wildlife told TOI, “Currently there are 26 tigers which have strayed out of Ranthambore and most of them have been hunted. I have written to CM Gehlot to start probe in poaching cases. If the government fails to take preventive measures, then I will approach NGT.”

ALLAHABAD: Fourteen Allahabad residents who who travelled to Asian nations like China and returned to the city in the past one month have been put under observation as part of the district administration’s precautionary measures against the novel Coronavirus (nCoV) outbreak.According to health department data released on Friday, 36 residents had returned to Allahabad after visiting China and other neighbouring Asian countries like Hong Kong, Thailand and Singapore between December 1, 2019 and February 14. Of these, 31 were put under observation under the Integrated Disease Surveillance Programme (IDSP) December 1 onwards. A person returning from China or an adjoining country has to be kept under surveillance of IDSP for at least 28 days during the three-month period.They had been put under observation in special isolation wards at Motilal Nehru Medical College and Colvin Hospital, and at their homes. While none of the passengers showed any symptoms of the deadly virus, but the move was seen as a precautionary measure.District epidemiologist Dr. Anshu Vaish said, “The department is maintaining a database of travellers arriving in the city from nCoV-affected countries since December 2019. There were 36 such passengers who had arrived in the city since December 1, 2019. They were put under observation and five of them had visited other cities like Jaunpur and Kolkata.”Vaish said that 22 of them were released after being isolated for 28 days. “The remaining passengers have been put under isolated conditions at their homes.” He also said that a dedicated ambulance has been deployed at the Bamrauli Airport to rush any passengers who might exhibit novel Coronavirus-like symptoms.“Apart form coordinating with state IDSP unit and World Health Organisation (WHO) officials, we have also been carrying out sensitisation campaign at airport and railway stations to educate people about n-CoV,” he added.Vaish said that residents are being briefed about the precautions which might reduce the risk of them contracting n-CoV.Novel Coronavirus has claimed as many as 1,300 lives in China, the epicentre of the contagion, over the past two months. The country has reported over 15,000 cases leading to several airlines restricting operations to China. The Indian government recently evacuated.

108,['15/02/2020'],Cargo code of truckers hinder STF crackdown against liquor mafia,"This story is from February 15, 2020

Representative image

ALLAHABAD: Liquor mafia ’s reliance on truck drivers to deliver consignments of rectified spirit and illegal alcohol is proving to be the main obstacle in Special Task Force’s ( STF ) crackdown against their operations in the state.

According to police, most liquor smugglers depend on a nexus of truck drivers to deliver their consignments. However, these drivers are not told the exact location where the consignment has to be dropped or the person they are supposed to hand over the package. The drivers are given a ‘code word’ and the men tasked with the job of receiving the consignment would call them and would tell them the location only after the drivers say the code word,” said police.

STF got to know about the modus operandi only after it arrested a truck driver on February 8 along with illegal liquor worth Rs 56 lakh. The accused, Jaswinder Singh alias Kakka, is a resident of Mohali in Punjab and told the police that he had not been given the exact location for the delivery.

The accused also said that racketeers would contact him and tell him the location, only when he said the code word.

Earlier, the racketeers would rope in transporters for delivering the consignments. The transporters used decoy trucks or swapped vehicles and routes as and when required. In addition, the racketeers have check points between two locations to track the consignment.

Additional SP (STF) Neeraj Kumar Pandey said that drivers were being given the consignment and were even not told about the exact location of delivery. “The trucks or mini-trucks they use usually have fake registration plates and drivers are assigned a particular code word for a particular route, which they use to contact the racketeers at the delivery point,” Pandey said.

He said the racketeers used to change their SIMs after every delivery to evade police action.

Pandey also maintained that racket kingpins had stopped travelling in trucks ever since the STF tightened the noose around liquor smugglers.

STF sleuths said gangs often smuggled rectified spirit from Haryana and Punjab to eastern UP, where the final product was prepared. The additional SP said at least nine such gangs were busted last year.

109,['15/02/2020'],"Donor, recipient hemophiliacs, but transplant success","This story is from February 15, 2020

Coimbatore: Doctors in a Coimbatore hospital transplanted a kidney in a 12-year-old boy suffering from haemophilia, a blood disorder that does not allow it to clot like it is supposed to.

What makes the case rare is that the kidney donor, who was the boy’s maternal uncle, also suffers from haemophilia.

The surgery was performed by replacing the missing protein, which would restore clotting mechanism temporarily, for 10 days, by which time the wound healed reasonably.

Doctors in Kovai Medical Center and Hospital, where the surgery was performed, said they were yet to come across a case of renal transplant in medical literature where the kidney recipient and donor both suffer from haemophilia. “So far, nowhere in the world, a kidney transplant has been done in a recipient with haemophilia from a donor who also has haemophilia as these cases are considered to have a very high risk for bleeding after surgery,” said nephrologist Dr V Mangalakumar.

Doctors say the main risk of operating on such patients is uncontrollable bleeding and the burden of maintaining two patients with the issue. However, faced with no other viable option, they decided to go ahead.

It was around five months ago that a 12-year-old boy, who was suffering from advanced kidney failure, was brought Dr Mangalakumar. The boy has a rare genetic condition called Alport syndrome, which led to the kidney failure. The boy was advised an immediate transplant and his maternal uncle, whose HLA type and blood matched his, came forward to donate one of his kidneys.

However, during evaluations, the doctors found that both the boy and his uncle also had haemophilia.

In haemophilia cases, replacing the missing protein will restore the clotting mechanism temporarily and stop the bleeding. This should be continued for at least 10 days after the surgery to minimise late bleeding complications.

The team, which included Dr Mangalakumar, urologists Dr Barani Kumar and Dr Kuppurajan and vascular surgeon Dr Bala Sundaram, performed the transplant. Both the donor surgery and the recipient surgery went well without any complications.

The donor was discharged five days after the surgery and the recipient went home 10 days after the surgery, with normal kidney function.

Times News Network

Ludhiana: The police on Friday claimed to have arrested three more accused, including a woman, in the February 9 gang-rape case.

An auto-rickshaw driver, along with his two accomplices, had raped a 23-year-old woman and dumped her when she fell unconscious.

Police said the arrested woman, Renu, knew the three accused, as they frequented the eatery where she worked. “Renu helped the three commit the crime,” said a cop.

The first arrest was made on February 12, when Ram Narayan, a labourer, was nabbed from Mundiyan. “Following his interrogation, the three others were arrested from Kohara on Chandigarh Road. They are Barjesh Kumar, 27, the auto driver and resident of Hardoi; Mohammad Malik, 28, a labourer and resident of Bhamiyan Khurd; and Renu, 35, of Kohara,” the cop added.

Additional deputy commissioner of police (ADCP-IV) Ajinder Singh said, “On February 7, the survivor had gone to a Ludhiana village to look for an accommodation on rent. There, she met Renu. Renu introduced her to Brijesh, saying he could help her find a house. Brijesh asked the survivor to come to Samrala with advance payment on February 9. On the day, the survivor told Brijesh that she could not withdraw money for advance payment as banks were closed. On this, Brijesh offered her a lift in his auto, saying he would take her to an ATM kiosk from where she could withdraw money. But instead, he took her to the Clock Tower Chowk, where two of his accomplices boarded the auto.”

The accused took the survivor to an isolated place and gang raped her.

“When the survivor lost consciousness, the accused left her there and escaped. On gaining consciousness, the survivor called up her husband, who rushed to the spot and took her to a hospital. A case under sections 376D (gang rape) and 120 B (criminal conspiracy) of the IPC was registered against the accused,” the ADCP added.

114,['15/02/2020'],"Finally, transwoman registers marriage","This story is from February 15, 2020

Coimbatore: The Valentine’s Day meant a lot for transsexual woman Surekha, 24, and her partner Manikandan, 26. The couple, who got married in 2018, was able to register their marriage. On Friday, their wish was fulfilled at Vadavalli sub-registrar office.

The couple could not earlier register their marriage as under Section 5 (iii) of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955, the term bride meant woman. The couple first attempted registering their marriage in 2019.

They were getting home rental agreements and electricity connections in Surekha’s name only because they were not legally married yet.

The couple approached the district collector two weeks ago, following which the inspector general of registrations wrote to the Vadavalli sub-registrar clarifying that the Act and the term bride were applicable for transgenders. The department contacted the couple’s lawyer PP Sivakumar and agreed to register their marriage.

The couple has been living in Kavundampalayam. Manikandan is an autorickshaw driver.

“I feel so happy that I feel like I have got a new life,” Manikandan said after registering their marriage. Surekha said it was in this moment that she finally felt legally accepted by society.

“I didn’t feel this way, even when my gender change was published in the gazette and when I got my Aadhaar and voter id card. I file like my married life has just begun,” she added.

“I want to be an example to people who don’t feel confident about being in love with transsexuals and to transsexuals who are in love with either men or women,” said Manikandan.

“I can now provide my marriage certificate for fertility treatment, or child adoption, to take a loan together and open a joint bank account, which is how every other couple lives,” said Surekha.

They were accompanied by Manikandan’s parents, Surekha’s adopted mother and their friends to the sub- registrar office.

Surekha, who works in a dairy farm in Narasimanaickenpalayam, said, “I don’t have my parents or any siblings, because I left home as a child. I also need some legal family.”

The Madras high court in April 2019 ruled that the term “bride” under the Hindu Marriage Act includes transwomen and directed authorities to register a marriage between a man and a transsexual woman.

The aggrieved widow claimed that she only got the permission when she approached the district magistrate at the collectorate.

When contacted, police station in-charge Sujit Verma rubbished the charges levelled by the martyr’s widow.

“When she contacted me on the phone, I asked her to submit a consent letter from her inlaws as there is some kind of dispute between her and her inlaws. How can I refuse for the event which is related to the martyrdom of a soldier?”, he said.

“Mummy, now we have become good children as we have started going to school, but Papa doesn’t come. He only used to say that one who goes to school is a good child. Earlier, Papa even used to call us on phone, but now he no more calls us. Mummy, will we meet him in the village?,” the 5-year-old Ayush asked volley of questions from his mother Ruby.

On Friday, Ruby along with her children, went to her inlaws’ place in Kanpur Dehat to take part in the ‘Hawan’ ceremony on the occasion of the first death anniversary of her husband.

yyyyyyyyyyyy

Mussoorie: Deplorable condition of public toilets has become a major cause of concern for residents of the queen of hills. Some of the common issues that people claim to face while using a public loo in the hill town are — broken taps, lack of water supply, no electric lights, poor cleanliness and unbearable stench among others.

The public toilets that are in a poor condition are located on the Mall Road (near Chick Chocolate), on Camel’s Back Road (near Bahuguna Park), near Nagar Palika office, opposite MDDA parking towards Landour, near Inder Bhawan, and at Bata Ghat. Residents of Kolhu Khet (on Mussoorie-Dehradun road) also allege that the public toilet in their area hasn’t been in operation for over two weeks now.

“Public toilets at most places in the town are in a poor state due to lack of cleanliness and maintenance. This causes hardships for both locals and tourists,” said Jagjeet Kukreja, secretary of Mussoorie Traders' Association.

In view of the poor state of public toilets, residents have urged the officials of Mussoorie Municipal Council (MMC) to take immediate action before the tourist season begins.

“During peak tourist season, I have seen tourists requesting hotel owners to allow them access to toilets rather than using public toilets. I would urge the authorities to construct new toilets while ensuring maintenance of existing ones, without further delay,” Mohan Petwal, a resident, said.

Meanwhile, ML Shah, executive officer of MMC, told TOI, “Repair work has been initiated in some toilets. Proper cleanliness and adequate water supply would also be ensured. As for the public toilet at Kolhu Khet, it has been handed over to the tourism department and is currently under maintenance.”

120,['15/02/2020'],Kolkata must regain its past biz glory: Goyal,"This story is from February 15, 2020

Kolkata: Kolkata needs to recreate the enthusiasm of the past and encourage businesses to regain its position of pre-eminence on the Indian industrial map, said union commerce and railways minister Piyush Goyal at the ET Bengal Corporate Awards in Kolkata on Thursday. Inaugurating the 7th edition of the awards, Goyal said that the city has lost its ‘competitive edge’ since business and industry has ‘not been allowed to grow in Bengal’. Goyal, however, added that it was reassuring to see new businesses and young entrepreneurs emerge from the state and they were doing the country proud.

Describing Kolkata as ‘a city of freedom fighters, philosophers, educationists, poets, writers and tall industry leaders’, the minister said it was once the economic and financial capital of India. “While the RBI was headquartered in Kolkata, the SBI had its registered office here. Kolkata had the first modern port and of course, the Howrah Bridge. It is an engineering marvel which used steel, 90% of which was produced in India. Compared to the Howrah bridge that was built in just 41 months, it took 14 years to build the Vidyasagar Setu,” said Goyal.

Kolkata, Goyal pointed out, has immense potential. “But the city is losing out on the chance to bring the mojo back,” he said. Business models need to be reconsidered to meet the new global challenges of business, felt the minister. Kolkata could play a leading role in that effort, he said. “You have the Bengal Chamber of Commerce and Industry (BCC&I), which is one of the oldest in the country. We can work together to grow and focus on growth,” said Goyal.

India could indeed grow into a $5 trillion-dollar economy in five years, observed Goyal. “Prime Minister Narendra Modi has laid down this target and it can be a reality. It may sound difficult now but it is good to have an ambitious target. But remember it will only be the cusp for further growth,” said Goyal. He went on to add that the union budget has laid the foundation for a leap to the $5 trillion-dollar target.

Global uncertainties in business necessitated that India Inc stayed together to continue on the path of growth, observed Goyal. He, however, rued that it was difficult to build consensus in India. “For instance, Indian steel is not allowed in some countries though there isn’t any government sanction against us. Their trade bodies block the entry of our products. When I tried to do it to some of their products, there was resistance from the stake-holders in India. This is detrimental to the growth of our industry,” he said.

Union minister of state for environment and forest Babul Supriyo — who was also present at the event — called upon the industry captains to invest more and take advantage of the corporate tax benefits announced in the budget.

121,['15/02/2020'],"Now, birdwatchers flock to Akkulam","This story is from February 15, 2020

Thiruvananthapuram: After a flock of Red Avadavat, locally known as ‘Kumkuma Kuruvi’, was spotted at Akkulam Lake near the National Institute of Speech and Hearing (NISH) campus by bird watchers Anoop Palode and Suraj S R, bird watchers have shifted their focus from Punchakari to Akkulam. However, new development works planned at Akkulam is raising concerns.

The sparrow-sized bird, also known as Red Munia or Strawberry Finch, are commonly found in Kole wetlands in Thrissur. Though one or two were sighted in the wetlands in city, Red Avadavat stayed away from viewfinders due to its nature of avoiding any close contact with human beings. Anoop Palode, who is a bird watcher and photographer for around 15 years, said that he had spotted one in Akkulam during a bird watching programme of World Wild Fund four years ago, but missed to capture in a frame. “These birds prefer to stay away from humans. So when Suraj and I spotted around 20 of them on December 31, we were surprised. Since then, we have been closely studying them. We have spotted a flock of 30 birds last month. After we shared pictures in bird watchers’ groups, more people are visiting the site to see them,” said Anoop.

Presence of tall grass, which is ideal of nesting, and seeds in it are the reasons for Red Avadavat to flock to the area, said Suraj. “Unfortunately, recently we saw some people setting fire on a small portion of grass where we used to spot the bird,” said Suraj.

Anoop too raised concern over the proposal of tourism department to initiate revival works of the lake. “If the construction works are done without considering the natural habitat of these birds, we will lose them forever,” he said.

After they raised concerns, Swasti Foundation submitted a petition to tourism minister Kadakampally Surendran to take necessary action.

“The breeding time of Red Avadavat is during the month of June. Due to climate change, there might be changes in the time. However, we have requested government to be cautious during the next six months so that their natural habitat won’t be destroyed,” said Suraj.

Optimists: The planning department expects to prevent and significantly reduce marine pollution of all kinds, ... Read More

Mangaluru: The planning department of Karnataka has prepared strategies and an action plan for conservation and sustainable use of the oceans , seas and marine resources for sustainable development. The department expects to prevent and significantly reduce marine pollution of all kinds, in particular from land-based activities, including marine debris and nutrient pollution, by 2025. The department has observed a decline in coastal water quality.

Department additional chief secretary Dr Shalini Rajneesh, in a presentation, has pointed out that Karnataka has rich marine resources which offer massive employment, food and nutritional security. However, the coastal water quality has been declining and the bivalve production too has seen a drastic decline by 71% during the last 15 years. “The department has set a target of addressing the threats of industrial effluents and sewage through coastal water monitoring and initiate necessary action. More emphasis will be on zero discharge of industrial effluents and sewage. Policies and action plans will be prepared to identify the declining coastal fisheries due to pollution, and initiate measures to improve the ambient coastal water quality,” she said, adding that it is aimed at earmarking 5% of the total budget of fisheries department for the purpose.

Major steps include installation of a number of sewage treatment plants along the coast, and construction of toilets under the Swachh Bharat Mission. Out of 27 urban local bodies (ULB) in coastal districts of Uttar Kannada, Udupi and Dakshina Kannada, 23 have been certified open defecation free (ODF), and third-party inspection is under progress, Shalini said.

With regard to the presence of petroleum hydrocarbons in coastal waters in Kulai, which is an industrial discharge point in Mangaluru, an action plan will be prepared to strengthen the CRZ, and the Coast Guard to monitor pollution levels, she said.

Representative image

KANPUR: Police rescued three snake charmers, who were allegedly kidnapped by wildlife smugglers after they had failed to supply them Red Sand Boa snake to them in lieu of money.

“All three snake charmers hail from Jogi Dera Basti in the Mangalpur area of Kanpur Dehat. They promised the wildlife smugglers to supply Red Sand Boa snake on February 10 and in lieu of which they had received Rs 45,000 in cash from them.

When they failed to arrange Red Sand Boa snake for the smugglers, they first kidnapped the snake charmer Sanoj Nath and demanded Rs 49,000 as ransom from his family members for his safe release. Later, when the two other snake charmers from Sanoj’s village--Pintu and Gautam Nath--went to Sanompur village in Auraiya to hand over the smugglers the ransom amount, the latter also held them captive after snatching the money (Rs 49,000). Subsequently, the police were informed and the trio were rescued from the Auraiya-Jalaun border on Thursday. The smugglers, who had dumped the trio on the Auraiya-Jalaun border, however, managed to flee,” said inspector Mangalpur Shiv Kumar Rathore. “Separate teams have been formed and dispatched to possible hideouts of the kidnappers to arrest them:, he added.

Not very long ago, a B.Tech student and one other were arrested by the Chakeri police for trying to sell two Sand Boa snakes (Eryx johnii), a protected species, under the Wildlife (Protection) Act.

“Known as ‘domuha’ in the region, the nearly-threatened species is said to have a great demand in the international and domestic markets due to a superstition that it brings good luck and it is also used for making medicines for sexual health”, said a wildlife expert.

126,['15/02/2020'],"Film heritage mission on track, says NFAI director","This story is from February 15, 2020

Pune: This year’s Union Budget has done away with the separate allocation for the National Film Heritage Mission (NFHM), but the National Film Archive of India (NFAI), the mission’s nodal agency, is not unduly bothered.

“The NFHM project is very much on track. It will receive funding from another head in the budget known as development communication and development of filmic content,” Prakash Magdum, the NFAI director, said.

Against a budgetary allocation of around Rs22 crore in 2019-20, the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting (MI&B) had disbursed only Rs3.61 crore to the NFHM.

Officials surmised that such a huge gap between allocation and spending had probably resulted in the NFHM not receiving any allocation at all.

“The non-allocation is part of a rationalisation process of the ministry, so that money can be allocated as per the need of a particular project,” Magdum said.

The NFHM started in 2017 with a mandate to collect, assess, and preserve film reels as well as non-film materials associated with cinema, such as posters, flyers, or booklets, which have historical and aesthetic value.

While the project had a slow start, the initial phases of the project have been completed or are close to completion, with the film assessment phase by a prominent film laboratory over, and the assessed material being handed over to the National Film Archive of India with observations.

While 1, 31,000 reels and other non-film materials were originally meant to be assessed, the final assessment came to nearly 1,50,000, according to the National Film Archive of India.

The next phase of the NFHM will be to digitise and/or restore the matter assessed. The NFAI officials said that the tenders for digitisation and restoration are ready, but a decision on the films and materials needed to be digitised and restored will depend on a “wide matrix” of factors.

“It has been a wide and all-encompassing process. About 4,000 films in various languages are slated to be digitised and restored. So, we are consulting stakeholders from across the film industry, including well-known directors, producers, and even state governments,” he said.

“Then we will take a call on the films to be digitised or restored which again will depend on a wide matrix of factors, such as the language, the physical condition of the film, if it has been made by a renowned director, or starred legendary actors etc,” he added.

Coimbatore: Roads in the city are expected to be much safer over the next few years, as both the Coimbatore Corporation and highways department will be equipped with dedicated road safety wings. The road safety wing’s main responsibility is to incorporate road safety elements within the design of roads. While highways departments across the state has been granted road safety cells, Coimbatore Corporation is one of three local bodies also granted road safety cells along with Chennai and Madurai.

In his Budget speech in the assembly on Friday, deputy chief minister and finance minister O Paneerselvam allocated Rs 500 crore for the revamped Tamil Nadu Road Safety Fund. This is to mainly fund these dedicated road safety wings. “Simple ways to make new roads safer is to give it dedicated pavements so that pedestrians are protected, give it adequate assigned parking space and ensure signals are in visible space,” said a highways department official. “Also putting clear sign boards announcing barricades, creating safe and smooth speed breakers are also other simple methods,” he said. They expect the road safety wings to bring in more elements.

The panchayats in Coimbatore are also likely to receive more funds this year, with the statement government announcing a grant of Rs 556 crore for urban local bodies. Coimbatore is one of the four districts—the others being Chennai, Madurai and Trichy—included to benefit under this scheme. And it falls under the 15th finance commission recommendations.

The city’s Government College of Technology which is completing 75 years this year has been given a special grant of Rs 10 crore to upgrade its infrastructure and facilities. “In addition to this, the college has number of illustrious alumni, who are willing to contribute to further development of the institution. The government will match the contribution made by the alumni during the 75th anniversary year for the development of the college,” the finance minister said.

There were allegations that the girl was pregnant. On Friday, a post-mortem examination conducted on the body of the deceased confirmed the pregnancy.

Coimbatore: A few years down the line, motorists driving on Avinashi Road neither have to move bumper-to-bumper in traffic jams nor wait for a minute at each traffic signals. Thanks to the state government for it has decided to construct a flyover for 10.1km on the road.

The four-lane expressway would start from Uppilipalayam Junction and end after Kovai Medical Centre Hospital (KMCH) on the road.

During his budget speech in assembly on Friday, deputy chief minister O Panneerselvam said that the state government has accorded sanction for the elevated road to be constructed at the cost of Rs 1,620 crore. “A provision of Rs 200 crore has been made in the Budget estimates for 2020-21 for implementation of the project,” he added.

A senior official from the highways department said that the flyover would have entry and exit ramps for vehicles at four locations near Anna Statue, Fun Mall Junction, Hope College and Airport Junction. This is the first flyover which is to be constructed with multiple ramps in the district.

We have decided to include ramps only at those locations where the requirement of land acquisition is minimum, the official said, adding that they would be acquiring only the space where the compound wall is constructed and vacant space behind it. “We would not acquire any structures,” she added.

“The flyover design is almost at the final stage and once the design is completed, it would be submitted for technical approval. Mostly, the tender to select a suitable bidder for the project would be floated within three months. If everything goes right, the construction work could be commenced within six to seven months,” the official said.

Explaining that close to 10,000 vehicles use Avinashi Road on a day, another official said that more than half of the vehicle population is expected to use the flyover and it in turn would reduce the traffic congestion to a larger extend on the road. The traveling time is expected to be cut down by 15–20 minutes, he added.

Welcoming the move, city-based activists said that it would be a huge relief to the commuters for Avinashi Road is one of the highly congested roads in the city.

With the introduction of ramps at multiple junctions, the flyover would not just be useful for those who travel outside the city, but also to those who travel within, K Kathirmathiyon, a member of road safety committee, said.

“It would be even more better if the government speeds up and complete the ongoing flyover construction work in the district – Trichy Road flyover, Ukkadam flyover and flyovers on Mettupalayam Road - before it commences the construction work as it might increase the inconvenience caused to the commuters,” he added.

“At present, most of the vehicles travelling on the road are waiting for at least for a minute at each signal and it in turn raises the blood pressure for the commuters. The flyover would reduce the tension level of the commuters,” secretary of Coimbatore district road safety association M Devendran said.

He said it would be even more better if the department considers ending the flyover near Chinniampalayam as traffic congestion could be completely avoided within the city limit.

Mangaluru: The family of Harish Bangera , a resident of Kundapur, Udupi, who was arrested in Saudi Arabia for his alleged derogatory Facebook posts, is awaiting his safe return. Harish’s family alleges there has been no progress in the case even after two months.

Harish Bangera, 33, an AC mechanic working in Dammam, Saudi Arabia, was arrested by the Saudi authorities for his alleged social media comments on Saudi crown prince Mohammed bin Salman and Mecca. He had allegedly uploaded it on December 19 and was arrested the next day by Saudi officials. The company he was working for had terminated his service after his post drew criticism across the world.

No news since arrest

“We have not heard anything from Harish after he was arrested. Some of his colleagues and friends have told us that the Saudi Arabia police are still investigating the matter, and it will take nearly three months to complete the process. Meanwhile, political representatives including Udupi-Chikkamagaluru MP Shobha Karandlaje have assured of help for his safe return to India,” said Sumana M, Harish’s wife. Sumana is living with her two-and-a-half-old child in a rented house in Kundapur.

“With Harish’s’ arrest, we have not been able to pay rent for two months, and there is no family support for me as ours was a love marriage,” Sumana said.

Harish Bangera went to Saudi Arabia in 2014. For a few years he worked as a machine operator and started working as an AC mechanic from the past two years. “My husband had come on vacations three times after 2014. We want to end all this and he should return back home safely,” said Sumana.

Rumour dispelled

On social media posts doing the rounds that Harish has reportedly converted to Islam in order escape punishment, which includes getting lashing and having to pay a heavy fine, she denied it, saying it was a rumour.

“When we contacted the Indian Embassy in Saudi Arabia, they informed us that this did not happen. It was spread by rumourmongers.”

Suman claims that her husband is innocent, and the post on Facebook were uploaded by a fake social media profile created under his name. “I am aware that he (Harish) had posted something related to the CAA and NRC protest, which turned violent, resulting in two deaths due to police firing. Apart from it, he never posted anything as alleged by others. We have filed a complaint in this regard at the Cyber Economic and Narcotics (CEN) station in Udupi,” she added.

Owners of illegally parked buses will be fined Rs 25,000

PUNE: The civic body’s anti-encroachment department has decided to clamp jammers on private buses parked illegally on the road from this week.

“No notices will be served before the action. It will be a direct action,” Madhav Jagtap, head of the PMC’s anti-encroachment department, told TOI.

He said the PMC will slap a fine of Rs 25,000 on each of the owners of buses parked illegally on the road. The private bus service operators are expected to park their vehicles at the designated parking bays allotted to them. Parking at any other place, especially along the road, will attract a fine, Jagtap said.

The private bus owners, however, termed the civic body’s decision to take action against them as an “injustice”. They said that they were left with no option but to park their vehicles on the road because of inadequate parking facilities. “The local self-government body was supposed to provide us with parking facilities at different locations. The pickup points were to be at four directions in the city. But not all the promises were fulfilled,” said Balasaheb Khedekar, president, Pune District Luxury Bus Association.

He said the association will approach the PMC and demand a solution to these problems. A case was filed in the Bombay HC and its directives would be followed by the PMC. The members will also demand a status check during the meeting with the civic authorities.

A Pune police notification in 2018 had put restriction on private buses in the city during daytime. As per the notification, private luxury buses can ply only on four prescribed routes to cities like Mumbai, Nashik, Ahmednagar and Solapur.

It also banned the movement of luxury buses on these prescribed routes from 8am till noon and from 5pm till 9pm. The bus operators had filed a plea against the police directives following which the Bombay HC had granted an interim stay on the notification.

The 23-year-old complainant said in her police complaint, “I got married when I was 20-year-old. Later, I parted ways with my husband and came back to my parents’ house. My neighbour, who is in his 20s, has been raping me since I was 17-year-old. I did not tell my parents about it as he had threatened to kill my family if I breathed a word about his misdeeds. Besides, he was blackmailing me.”

In January, the accused called her to his house and raped her again. “I then mustered courage to speak about it,” she added.

Investigating officer sub-inspector Manjit Kaur said, “We are recording the statement of the complainant before court. Her medical examination will be conducted.

135,['15/02/2020'],Pest control measure proves fatal for couple,"This story is from February 15, 2020

Pune: Tuesday’s tragic incident in which a middle-aged couple died of asphyxiation after their Bibvewadi flat was fumigated once again underscored the lack of awareness over pest control measures.

The couple — Aparna Majali (54) and her husband Avinash (64) — got their flat in Ganesh Vihar Society fumigated on Tuesday morning and, on returning home from around 7pm, did not switch on the fan or open the doors and windows to let in fresh air.

“Sassoon General Hospital, in its advance post-mortem report, has certified the cause death as ‘asphyxiation’. The histopathology report is awaited,” assistant inspector Rajesh Usgaonkar of Bibvewadi police said.

Many pest control agencies guarantee 100% results, but the use of gas-based treatment and fumigation is not permitted in residential areas, under the Insecticide Act, 1968.

This can be done only at the warehouses containing food grains and export items. “Many customers ask us for the gas treatment in their houses as they do not know it is not permitted,” Sachin Nalawade, who runs a pest control agency in the city, said.

Nalawade added gas treatment seldom proves useful, as it does not eliminate insects like bedbugs. “Contact poisoning is the most effective. Spraying chemicals works best,” he said.

Another pest control operator said doors and windows should not be closed during spray treatment. “If the windows are open, toxic vapours will not accumulate in the flat,” he said.

He said it was advisable for people to not inhabit the house for 24 hours after the treatment.

Nalawade further said customers must check that the operator has a proper licence. “Licensed agencies never use hazardous pesticides ... in many cases aluminium phosphate is used, which proves fatal,” he said.

Representative image

HYDERABAD: In a first such move in Hyderabad, a mosque committee in the Old City has allowed yoga classes to fight rising non-communicable diseases and obesity. One of the three floors in the Masjid-e-Ishaq at Nawab Saheb Kunta at Tadbun has been converted into a healthcare and medical counselling centre where Yoga is also taught.

“There is not much space in the narrow lanes for walking and outdoor exercises. So, in the mosque our counsellors are not only demonstrating yoga asanas, but also giving YouTube links to some patients to follow Yoga on mobile phones to reduce their waistline,” Mujtaba Hasan Askari, who runs the clinic, told TOI.

Most women attending the mosque clinic are at risk of non-communicable diseases, including heart ailments due to their weight. Every alternate day, yoga is taught to patients in the mosque. Health counsellors follow WHO guidelines on fighting non-communicable or lifestyle diseases and have adopted Yoga as part of the healthcare regimen to keep people in the Old City fit.

The move follows a recent health survey of patients attending the clinic in the mosque. Of the 600 people, mostly women, 70% had a body mass index (BMI) of more than 30 (less than 24.9 BMI is considered healthy). The clinic organisers considered various options and yoga emerged the favourite as the geo-demographic profile of Old City does not permit other options such as outdoor exercises.

Askari, who is also the managing trustee of the Helping Hand Foundation (HHF), said HHF was running the clinic in partnership with SEED, a US-based NGO. The lifestyle clinic at Masjid-e-Ishaq has two dedicated dieticians and two counsellors under the supervision of a lady doctor. Yoga is prescribed after evaluating a WHO-recommended form filled in by the patients. The focus is more on exercises and diet control than on medication.

Dietician Farhat Fatima, who evaluates dozens of patients at the mosque every day, said she was prescribing yoga as it gives the best result and can be performed indoors. “I counsel them in a way that they can relate to. If I tell them to walk daily, they cannot do it in narrow lanes,” she said.

Ayesha Sultana, 46, registered at the lifestyle clinic a month ago. A patient of diabetes and hypertension, Ayesha told TOI that her health has improved after she took to yoga. “I was not aware that diet and exercise will do wonders to one’s health. Now my dependence on medication has come down,” she said.

Pune: A lecture on ‘Knowing RSS’, which was eventually cancelled, has put the SPPU’s department of communication and journalism in a spot, with state minister Balasaheb Thorat seeking an inquiry into it.

Taking to Twitter, Thorat alleged that RSS “swayamsevaks” were now campaigning inside varsity campuses. “Rather than focusing on giving quality education, they are trying to induct more people as RSS Swayamsevak by intruding schools, colleges & varsity campuses. This is serious and inquiry has to be conducted. I spoke to higher and technical minister Uday Samant & requested probe and action against the offenders (sic),” he tweeted.

Samant, who is on a tour to the Konkan region, could not be reached for his comments.

Even Nationalist Congress Party MP Supriya Sule took strong objection to the mover and tweeted, “What is happening in Savitribai Phule Pune University? Whose idea was it to organise this event? Department of Communication and Journalism has put this up in their time table. Is the Vice-Chancellor aware that such a program is being organized (sic)?”

The Savitribai Phule Pune University in a statement issued late on Thursday said, “In the world view subject under Master of Journalism and Mass Communication course at SPPU, students are made aware of various thought processes so that they are aware of what is happening around them. Various organisations are also a part of this lecture series and this happens in various places. The ‘Knowing RSS’ lecture was a part of this series and this was to happen at Motibaug in Shaniwar Peth. However, there was opposition to this lecture from various quarters, hence, the lecture on Saturday was cancelled. From now onwards, the lectures about various organisations will happen within the department.”

An SPPU official said, “The lecture stands cancelled till we are able to announce the full schedule.”

141,['15/02/2020'],Rs 500 crore more for Athikadavu-Avinashi Scheme in budget,"This story is from February 15, 2020

Coimbatore: The state government has allotted Rs 500 crore more in the budget for the Athikadavu-Avinashi groundwater recharge and drinking water supply scheme.

The government gave administrative scantion to implement the scheme on March 28, 2018. Environmental clearance was given on December 19, 2019. An amount of Rs 1,000 crore was sanctioned for the project estimated to cost Rs 1,652. A pipeline is to be laid for 1,058 km and six pump houses constructed. A total of 1,048 water bodies will benefit from the scheme which will provide irrigation facilities to 24,468 acres in drought-prone areas and groundwater-depleted areas in Erode, Tirupur and Coimbatore districts. Water will be pumped from the Bhavani river.

The water bodies to be fed include tanks, ponds and check dams in Erode, Tirupur and Coimbatore districts which cover Perundurai, Chennimalai, Nambiyur, Gobichettipalayam, Bhavanisagar, Uthukuli, Avinashi, Tirupur, Annur, Sulur, Sarkarsamakulam, Periyanaickenpalayam and Karamadai blocks.

About 1.50 TMC surplus water will be drawn from the Bhavani basin (limited to pumping of 250 cusecs for 70 days). This will cater to the driking water needs, augment ground water and provide irrigation facilities in the drought-hit areas.

Dr D Prabu, Federation for Athikadavu-Avinashi Groundwater Recharge Scheme, said the federation welcomed the sanction of Rs 500 crore in this budget for speedy implementation of the scheme. “The check dams which are built between ponds and tanks for water conservation and percolation should be filled along with ponds and tanks. Only this will give real time benefit. The check dams which are the real infrastructure for ground water augmentation should not be neglected,” said Prabu.

He said the scheme should be speeded up and finished on target before the 2021 assembly election. Phase - II of the scheme (Sirumugai-Periyakallipatti and Perundurai and surrounding areas) proposed by the government to augment the needs of left out areas should be started at the earliest.

The scheme is being implemented by L&T construction company. Construction of four pump houses has started and work on the remaining two pump houses will begin the next week. Pipelines will be laid soon.

The state government has sanctioned Rs 230 crore for rehabilitation of the Noyyal river basin. According to PWD officials, the Noyyal river basin is 158.35 km long and has 18 anaicuts, 22 tanks and supply channels. “We are repairing the damaged 18 anaicuts. The entire stretch of the river basin is to be delisted and vegetation removed from the bunds and the river.

Sewage treatment plant at ARCI campus in Hyderabad

HYDERABAD: The National Environmental Engineering Research Institute (Neeri), Nagpur has set up Telangana ’s first phytorid-based sewage treatment plant at the campus of International Advanced Research Centre for Powder Metallurgy and New Materials (ARCI) in Hyderabad.

A patent technology developed by the institute headquartered in Nagpur, phytorid wastewater treatment is an environment-friendly technology to curb water pollution. Developed by Neeri director Rakesh Kumar, the technology has been adapted at over 200 places across the country.

It has been installed by the institute’s Centre of Strategic Urban Management (C-SUM) which aims to involve urban local bodies and stakeholders to build sustainable cities. Facilitating recycle and reuse of water, the technology uses plants to absorb nutrients directly from waste water.

According to the scientists, the plant at ARCI has a capacity of treating 15,000 litres of waste water per day. “Till now, the waste water generated at the campus would go directly into the septic tank. However now, the waste water is being efficiently treated and being utilized for maintaining the green cover,” said Ritesh Vijay, principal scientist and head of Mumbai zonal centre, adding that waste water from canteen, office area, toilets and washing area is completely getting treated. In the absence of large-scale STP , decentralized treatment technologies are the best way to save water bodies.

“The topography of ARCI campus was favourable for the plant. The technology is cost-effective and does not have any electrical requirement,” said Vijay.

As many as 725 schools in Maharashtra will be connected to the virtual classroom by e-Balbharati, earlier known as Balchitrawani. The students will be able to attend sessions with experts, lectures from renowned personalities, among others, through this virtual medium.

On Friday, students from Osmanabad, Kolhapur, Raigad, Ratnagiri, Ahmednagar and other districts, asked about the number of subjects that would be covered under this programme, how useful the facility would be for them, would the students of semi-English schools benefit from it, would it be used to relieve students’ stress.

Gaikwad said, “The virtual classroom set up in over 700 schools in Maharashtra will help lakhs of students connect and interact with experts. Experts, counsellors, motivational speakers will guide students on exams and how to de-stress during this period.”

Shraddha Patil, a teacher from Uran in Raigad, asked Gaikwad about her journey from being a professor to the education minister. Gaikwad said, “I was a student of a government Marathi-medium school and I would engage in sports activities till Standard X. I completed my postgraduation in Maths, followed by a bachelor's degree in education. I also enrolled for a doctorate degree. But, I joined politics. So, from being a teacher to minister was a tough road for me. But, I feel that each one of you have similar capabilities and can make Maharashtra proud.”

145,['15/02/2020'],Govt mulls light rail system to link 2nd airport in Parandur,"This story is from February 15, 2020

Chennai: As Parandur in Kancheepuram district has been zeroed in as venue for the proposed second airport, the state government is exploring the possibility of introducing a mass rapid transit link to connect it with the existing airport. While a light rail may link the airport in Meenambakkam to Parandur 62km away for transit passengers, there is also a plan to extend metro rail line from Poonamallee to connect it. Airports Authority of India (AAI) is planning to shift international flight operations to the second airport.

Sources in the industries department said the suggestion for light rail was floated during discussions about setting up the second airport. “Light rail is the only option for passengers landing at Meenambakkam to proceed towards Parandur. For city passengers, metro rail is an option,” an industries department official privy to developments told TOI. The Tamil Nadu Industrial Development Corporation Limited, which will appoint a consultant for the second airport, would also study which option will be feasible.

Light rail has smaller coaches with a train having two or four coaches and has less capacity than metro rail but is less expensive to build. It costs lesser than Rs 100 crore to build compared to the Rs 150 to \Rs 200crore a km an elevated metro line would cost.

The second airport will come up across 4,500 acres in Parandur, chosen due to its proximity to the national highway to Bengaluru. It was chosen after various locations including Mamandur and Cheyyur in Chengalpet district and a land near Gummidipoondi in Tiruvallur district were considered. “The existing airport will get saturated in a few years,” the industries department official added. The second airport plan has been delayed by more than 10 years.

Currently, the phase II line of metro rail that will be built till Poonamallee may be extended to Thirumazhisai, as per reports. It can be further extended to Parandur, which is located off Chennai-Bengaluru highway, sources said. The proposed metro rail line from Poonamallee will connect to existing Central-CMBT-Alandur line at CMBT. CMRL operates direct trains from Central to airport via CMBT and Alandur.

An AAI official said the second airport should have good connectivity to the city by a mass rapid transit system or a broader highway as it will be an aero city with aviation businesses, auxiliary units and training centres. AAI is building a terminal in the existing airport to increase passenger capacity to 30 million passengers as the airport is set to saturate by 2024.

Hyderabad: When city resident Pranay Upadhyay's son was found struggling with Autism, the doctor said that pollution could be one reason for his son’s diagnosis.

“That man-made problems such as pollution can have long-term impact on our children’s health is what I have experienced first-hand,” says Pranay. The 45-year-old says he after the diagnosis he could not just sit around and do nothing.

For over a decade, Pranay has not used petrol or diesel vehicles to travel. The techie uses his electric unicycle to travel from his home in Bowrampet in the outskirts of the city to Gachibowli. “It takes me around an hour on my one-wheel,” he says, adding that he enjoys the ride, which is eco-friendly, cost effective and easy to manoeuvre.

“Even cars give me way,” he chuckles. On days that there is a traffic block, he can easily manoeuvre through it or simply carry his 'vehicle’ and take public transport.

Pranay wears a board on his back while travelling, which reads: “Do you need a car/SUV during peak hours only to transport one person?” He says spreading awareness is the one thing he can do in the battle against pollution and climate change.

For long distances, the techie, who works for a robotic firm, uses a bicycle, peddling away for even 34hours to get to places such as Bengaluru from Hyderabad. “Since I began my journey, hundreds of people have switched to cycling,” he says.

Pranay says it is the fear of losing balance that probably keeps people away.

Pranay, a paramotor pilot, first came across his one-wheel drive when his aircraft manufacturer spoke about how the front wheel were being used for unicycles across Europe. “The unicycle feels like an extension of my body. It is safe and easy to use. In fact, I have not fallen once since I started using it and avoid potholes too,” he says.

For Pranay, the hope is to reduce one car at a time on the road. And people are taking notice of his novel efforts. Kajal Maheshwari, representing the Citizens for Hyderabad that has taken up several environmental causes said, “Pranay has by his example shown us it (eco-sensitive travel) is possible and doable. We are all looking forward to his help in acquiring the one-wheel wonder so that we can start trying it ourselves.”

HYDERABAD: A truck owner was arrested on Friday for killing his uncle to claim an insurance amount of Rs 50 lakh while trying to pass off the death as a road accident. Cops said that accused M Ramesh, in a bid to recoup his business losses, came up with the plan to kill his uncle Saidulu (35) after taking an insurance policy in his name with his mother as the beneficiary.

Ramesh, his associates Mahesh, a truck driver, and Sobhan Babu, a labourer, were arrested from Tadvai village in Munagala mandal of Suryapet district. According to police, Saidulu, whose wife had deserted him, did not have any immediate family members and was working as a cleaner on Ramesh’s truck.

“Ramesh had bought four trucks taking loan from private financiers. He suffered huge losses and sold off the trucks, but was still had a debt of Rs 50 lakh. The murder was a way to clear his debts,” Munagala CI S Siva Shankar Goud said.

Police said that on January 23 Ramesh along with the other accused and the victim started from Tadvai in his Bolero.

They stopped vehicle near a BP Petrol pump on Hyderabad-Vijayawada highway near Munagala, got Saidulu drunk and asked him to walk towards the parking bay. “Saidulu, who used to steal small items from parked trucks, went towards the empty parking bay and the accused ran him over,” said CI Goud, adding that Ramesh drove the vehicle over Saidulu multiple times to ensure he was dead

While initially it was thought to be an accident, cops in their preliminary probe found from villagers that Saidulu had a Rs 50 lakh life insurance policy. “We were surprised that Saidulu, who has no family and works as a cleaner, had life insurance of Rs 50 lakh. The insurance policy was taken in July 2019 with Ramesh’s mother Saraswati as the nominee. Ramesh had paid Rs 12,700 as first premium,” the inspector said.

Ramesh and the other accused were taken into custody and during interrogation they confessed to the murder. The petrol pump staff also confirmed that the accused and the victim consumed liquor near the pump on January 23 night, police said.

The police have seized the Bolero and the trio are now in judicial custody.

Dehradun: City-born fast bowler Sunny Rana clinched seven wickets while giving away just 43 runs during his 19-over-long spell during the ongoing Ranji Trophy match against Maharashtra in Baramati on Friday. This is the best bowling figure by any Uttarakhand bowler in a first-class match.

Rana broke the record of Deepak Dhapola who had taken seven wickets while giving away 50 runs against Manipur in a match played in Dehradun in November, 2018.

Speaking to TOI, Rana said, “The current season didn’t go the way I had expected, so I was keen to perform in our last Ranji Trophy match of the season. The wicket was flat and had nothing for fast bowlers. Therefore, it was tough to get wickets following the conventional style. I tried to keep an end tight and dry due to which the opposition batsmen ultimately played risky shots which didn’t turned out well for them. I would like to give credit to my personal coach Manoj Rawat and our team’s bowling coach Ashish Zaidi sir.”

Rana added, “We are trying desperately hard to win this as we haven’t won any game in this year’s Ranji Trophy tournament. Also, if we win this game and Tripura loses its match against Assam, we won’t get relegated back to the Plate Group.”

Notably, Maharashtra has set a target of 270 runs for Uttarakhand to chase in their second innings. After the end of Day 3, Uttarakhand stood at 103/2 with Kamal Singh (40*) and night-watchman Mayank Mishra (19*) at the crease.

152,['15/02/2020'],"Amid protests, Urdu back on signboards at rly platforms in U'khand","This story is from February 15, 2020

Dehradun: Barely days after replacing Urdu with Sanskrit, Dehradun railways authorities have now gone back to Urdu on signboards at railway stations.

The move comes days after name of Dehradun railway station was written in Sanskrit as Dehradunam, along with Hindi and English, when the station re-opened for public after three months. The name for Doiwala railway station, also in Dehradun, was written ‘Doiwalah’ and a new railway station in Rishikesh as ‘Yog Nagari Rishikeshah’.

However, soon after the railway ministry issued a notification stating that Sanskrit can be used as an additional language apart from the existing languages on railway signboards. Following which, the authorities went back to the format of English-Hindi-Urdu on February 10. But now the authorities are in a fix after members of right-wing outfits gheraoed the Dehradun station manager and demanded Sanskrit back on the signboards.

Ganesh Chandra Thakur, station director of Dehradun railway station, told TOI that the railway manual states that signboards at railway station should be in three languages — English, Hindi and regional/second language of the state. “It was right to replace Urdu with Sanskrit here. But adding a fourth language needs special provisions and approvals from both railways and state government. This will take some time and we are worried of the law and order situation as those who want Sanskrit back have threatened to protest and changing it immediately is not in our hands,” he said.

Meanwhile, members of right-wing outfits have announced to launch a protest if the authorities fail to include Sanskrit on the signboards by next week. RB Bijalwan, state president of Sanskrit teachers association, told TOI that removing Sanskrit from signboards was an insult to the language. “We have given a week’s time to the district magistrate and railway authorities to fix the issue. We want Sanskrit back on the signboard and have no problem with Urdu as an additional language,” he said.

Cabinet minister and government spokesperson Madan Kaushik said that the state government will write to the Centre and railway ministry to include Sanskrit on signboards at railway stations. “When we were part of UP, our second language was Urdu. Now, we are a different state and Sanskrit is our second language. We will be writing to the Centre seeking Sanskrit on our signboards,” Kaushik said.

Dehradun: The Smart Road construction work in Paltan Bazaar is drawing mixed responses from local traders. Currently, works on a 30-metre stretch of the road is ongoing but several traders complain that the pace is slow.

“The work on this small stretch of the road was supposed to be completed within a week but it has been almost four weeks and the work is still incomplete. I believe that officials should use more advanced methods,” said Ashok Chopra, a local trader.

Several traders claimed that the pace of works increased quite significantly only after they complained to the administration. “The pace of work was slow and no proper safety measures were being taken by the workers. Things changed for better after the matter was brought to the notice of officials,” said another local Anil Jain.

However, some traders also expressed their content with the ongoing works. “Traders will have to suffer for a while but things will get better after the construction is completed. Smart Road will make the market more spacious. These works are being undertaken for our welfare,” said Prateek, a local trader.

Meanwhile, the assistant general manager of Dehradun Smart City Limited (DSCL) Surya Kotnala told TOI, “For the convenience of traders, the construction work begins late at night. We don’t stack the material in the market and make sure that all the open spots are covered before the shops open.”

Rudrapur: Almost one-and-a-half years after Uttarakhand high court (HC) ordered a ban on the use of loudspeakers in shrines , the administration of Udham Singh Nagar district conducted a meeting with representatives of all religious organisations on Friday and decided to implement the HC order from February 15.

In an order issued in June 2018, the court had told the government that the use of loudspeakers, even during day, will be contingent on the user giving an undertaking that the noise level will not exceed five decibels.

The court directed the state government to ensure that no loudspeaker or public address system is used by any person or organisation, including religious bodies, without the written permission of the relevant authorities. District magistrate (DM) Neeraj Kharwal and senior superintendent of police (SSP) Barinderjit Singh called a meeting with representatives of religious organisations from all across the district. DM Kharwal said that as per the HC order, the use of loudspeakers at temples, mosques, and other public places without permission is banned from February 15 and it is also the deadline to remove amplifiers from these places.

""On court directions in relation to implementation of noise pollution control rules, a government order giving detailed instructions has been issued,"" Kharwal said.

SSP Singh added, ""A survey of permanently installed loudspeakers has been done and notices have been served to those who are using them without requisite permission. If the permission to install loudspeakers at religious or public places was not sought before February 15, we would remove it. After that, action will be initiated under Environment Protection Act 1986.”

Religious leaders also hailed the administration's move to remove unauthorised loudspeakers.

Cleric at the city’s Jama Masjid, Mohammad Imamuddin said, ""We welcome the order and have already applied to fill up the form provided by the district administration for permission.”

Tilak Raj Behar, patron of the Sanatan Dharam Sabha, added that cacophony had no place in a religion and that he, too, welcomed the order.

Chennai: The tenure of University of Madras vice-chancellor P Duraisamy is set to end in May and intense lobbying has begun to be on the search panel to pick his successor. The syndicate of the university, which convened on Friday to choose nominees to the vice-chancellor search panel, was surprised to see industrialist Nalli Kuppusamy’s name be proposed. After discussion, however, the syndicate unanimously elected P Ramasamy, former vice-chancellor of Alagappa University, as its nominee to the search panel.

“Despite the new law specifying qualifications for panel members and VC aspirants, a section of members proposed an industrialist’s name to the search panel,” a syndicate member said. As per the law enacted by the state government, universities can only nominate eminent academicians to the committee . But another member pointed out that the law is not binding on the university and proposing a prominent member of society was not a wrong move.

“The Madras University Act, 1923, was framed before Independence. The amendment will be applicable to Madras University only after getting the President’s assent,” a syndicate member said.

Professors said VC aspirants are trying to push members supportive of their candidature. “Many people are eyeing Madras University VC post. The intensive lobbying has just begun,” a senior professor said.

In 2016, following disappearance and non-cooperation of R Surendira Prasad, a members of the Madras University VC search panel, the state government brought the amendment fixing minimum qualification for search panel members and time limit to shortlist VC candidates.

A special senate meeting has been convened on February 20 to elect the senate nominee to the search panel. After that, the governor-chancellor would appoint his nominee and convener of the search committee. The new committee needs to submit a panel of three to five names to the chancellor within four months. It is the governor’s discretion to either dissolve the committee or give it time beyond that.

After taking over as vice-chancellor at critical juncture, P Duraisamy has so far provided a corruption-free administration.

Chennai: The state health department has ordered inquiry into why an ambulance wasn’t sent for a patient who made a distress call to 108 helpline on Sunday. The deceased is Ganesh Kumar, a 19-year-old college student who was playing cricket with friends. He had stepped aside to get water and was alone, when he experienced uneasiness and called for an ambulance. He died waiting for help.

Police said Ganesh was playing cricket with friends at Pachiyappan ground in Kancheepuram. “He developed uneasiness when he stepped aside to fetch water and called ‘108’. He explained the situation and requested an ambulance. But the call centre employee assumed it to be a prank call and refused to dispatch an ambulance,” a police officer privy to the case details said. He later died due of suffocation.

After his funeral, his family members checked his mobile and found the recording of his call to ‘108’, requesting an ambulance be sent to rescue him. The audio was shared on social media with his father saying Ganesh died due to the negligence of the ‘108’ call centre staff.

Sources said the call centre employee who attended his distress call insisted that he hand over the phone to someone nearby as he suspected it to be a prank call. Nearly 60% of the calls to 108 are not for emergencies. But that was no excuse.

“There is no reason why ambulance should be denied to anyone. The protocol is to take the risk and still send an ambulance,” said state health secretary Beela Rajesh. A detailed inquiry has been ordered.

“The staff is absconding now. He will appear before a committee,” she said. The department is also working to strengthen training of staff besides developing protocols that can prevent ineffective calls.

He said the administration had also assured to provide a job to martyr’s widow Sarabjit Kaur so that she and her one-and-a-half-year-old son Gurjot could have some financial security.

Former CRPF constable Lakhvish Singh, who is brother of martyr Maninder Singh, said cabinet minister Aruna Chaudhary had announced to recruit him as a constable in Punjab Police in the near future. After Maninder’s martyrdom, Lakvish resigned from his job to take care of his ailing father.

BATHINDA: In a flip-flop, the National Health Mission (NHM) withdrew its orders on Friday of stopping free treatment facility to girls up to the age of 5 and for first 24 hours in emergency cases after the admission of patients in government hospitals in Punjab.

State-run hospitals had stopped free treatment on Thursday after the director health services wrote to officials of the department in all 22 districts of Punjab and three government medical colleges, informing them that the Union government had not approved the scheme of free treatment to girl child up to 5 years in the programme implementation plans (PIP) 2019-20.

A total of Rs 1,054.82 crore has been approved under NHM for Punjab’s PIP for the financial year 2019-20 for various purposes, including immunisation.

Patients heading for emergency and getting treatment for small girls were taken by surprise when they were asked to pay. “We were told to pay for stitches, dressing applied on our four-year-old daughter. Earlier the treatment was free,” said Karamjit Kaur of Bathinda, who had taken her daughter for treatment at a government hospital.

On January 31, NMH Punjab had written to the director, health services (family welfare), that the approval had not been given in PIP 2019-20 for free treatment to girl child up to 5 years and free treatment for first 24 hours in emergency. Following the letter, the health department had written to all district officials on February 10 and free treatment facility was stopped on Thursday, sources in the health department said.

Bathinda civil surgeon Dr Amrik Sandhu said, “Free facility was stopped in some of the components of the treatment like medicines for various types of operations but the accidental cases are being handled as previously. It was being done as the Union government has not approved two schemes under Punjab NHM.”

When contacted, Punjab NHM mission director Kumar Rahul said, “The health authorities had some misunderstanding. Actually, along with the girl child, everyone is being given free treatment with a small token money on issuing the treatment slip. We have withdrawn the wrongly issued orders and free treatment facility will continue.”

The video posted on Facebook shows police evicting roadside vendors, stated the complainant, a sub-inspector of cybercrime cell.

Crime branch sources said after learning about the video doing rounds on social media, they had asked the cybercrime cell to investigate it. Police believe the sudden circulation of the old video ahead of US President Donald Trump’s visit to Ahmedabad has been done with mala fide intention.

“The intention of making this video viral is to create a law and order situation before the US president’s visit to the city” said a crime branch source.

Crime branch sources said they have requested the service provider to give them the IP address of the device from which the video was uploaded. “We have interrogated a few persons, who said the video was forwarded to them. We will trace the accused once we learn the IP address,” a cop said.

Rajeev Shukla

INDORE: Senior Congress leader Rajeev Shukla on Friday rubbished the notion that his party had a secret deal with Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) in Delhi elections and that people voted against BJP to keep communal politics at bay.

“In Delhi assembly polls, voters wanted to ensure BJP’s defeat at any cost. They were afraid that division of votes would result in BJP’s win, which was contesting on communal issues. As such, they voted for AAP, which was contesting with more intensity than BJP,” Shukla told mediapersons.

About speculations that his party had entered into a ‘secret-deal’ with AAP to defeat BJP, the Congress leader said, “Why any ‘secret-deal’ would be made? Our party contests every election with full might and in last assembly elections of Punjab, Congress had defeated AAP,” Shukla said.

When asked about Congress failing to open its account in Delhi, Shukla said, “The party is unhappy over the defeat and will work to remove weaknesses of the organization.”

Referring to union home minister Amit Shah’s claim that inflammatory statements by BJP leaders had led to party’s defeat, Shukla said, “People would only believe Shah (his sincerity) if his party will take disciplinary action against (BJP) leaders, who made hate speeches during electioneering.”

On external affairs minister S Jaishankar's remarks that a book had claimed Jawaharlal Nehru did not want Sardar Patel in his cabinet, Shukla said, “We did not expect such a statement from Jaishankar. Historical documents contradict his statement. So, it would be appropriate that he apologises for this statement about Nehru.”

Shukla also targeted Prime Minister Narendra Modi, saying that his intention was not clear over present system of giving reservation to SC/ST and OBC in jobs and education and the party wanted to deprive people of said categories from the benefits of reservation.

161,['15/02/2020'],Kafeel Khan slapped with NSA for anti-CAA speech at AMU,"This story is from February 15, 2020

Anuja.Jaiswal@timesgroup.com

Agra: The Uttar Pradesh police late on Thursday night slapped the stringent National Security Act (NSA) on Gorakhpur paediatrician Dr Kafeel Khan, hours before he was expected to walk free from Mathura jail , four days after he was granted bail by Aligarh chief judicial magistrate.

Aligarh district magistrate CB Singh said, “Protests had continued in the city and AMU for days after Khan delivered an inflammatory speech on the university campus. In fact, students turned violent on the campus on December 15”.

Deputy inspector general (Aligarh) Akash Kulhary told TOI that the NSA allows preventive detention for months if the authorities feel that the person is a threat to the national security or law and order.

Dr Khan was booked by Aligarh police on December 13 for delivering a provocative speech in Aligarh Muslim University (AMU) during an anti-CAA protest on the campus a day earlier and was arrested from Mumbai airport on January 29 by UP Police’s special task force. He was remanded to judicial custody for 14 days on January 30.

Khan had been lodged in Mathura jail despite bail granted being to him by the CJM’s court on February 10.

Khan’s younger brother, Kashif Jameel, who visited Mathura jail on Friday hoping to take his brother back home, told TOI that he was very disappointed with the government’s decision of slapping NSA on his brother.

“My brother is unnecessarily being harassed by the government because of his surname ‘Khan’. Many political leaders, including those from BJP, had given several inflammatory speeches, but none of them were harassed like my brother. They are trying to suppress his voice as he stands with others, demanding justice for the victims,” he said.

On Friday, Khan’s wife Shabistan Khan also reached Mathura jail to meet her husband but she started feeling unwell after she came to know about the NSA charges against him.

Khan’s lawyer Irfan Ghazi said they will soon challenge the NSA in a higher court. “The state government doesn’t want him to get out of the jail. That’s why his release was delayed by the jail authorities even after he was granted bail,” he said.

Claiming a threat to his life in jail, Ghazi said that Khan has been isolated from other prison inmates and is not getting his medicines.

After his arrest in Mumbai, Khan was brought to Aligarh, from where he was immediately shifted to the district jail in neighbouring Mathura.

According to the police, this was done as a precautionary measure in view of the anti-CAA protests on the AMU campus and at Eidgah grounds in the old city.

Police had said that Kafeel Khan's presence in the Aligarh jail could have worsened the law and order situation in the city.

The doctor was earlier arrested for his alleged role in the death of over 60 children in one week at the BRD Medical College in Gorakhpur in August 2017. Short supply of oxygen at the children’s ward was blamed at that time for the deaths.

About two years later, a state government probe cleared Kafeel Khan of all major charges, prompting him to seek an apology from the Yogi Adityanath government.

162,['15/02/2020'],Kal Bionics lends a ‘smart’ helping hand to millions,"This story is from February 15, 2020

Hyderabad: When Gayatri Roy Choudhury, who was born without an arm, was asked about the first thing she would do if she got her arm back, she said she would hold her child. Similarly, when Venketesh, who had lost both arms in an accident, was asked the same question, he sheepishly said he wanted to scratch his forehead first.

And fulfilling these wishes is a homegrown startup, Kal Bionics Private Limited, that was set up by five friends, Pranav Kumar, Philip Thomas, Sai Prasad, Harsha Reddy and Suren to leverage technology to solve some of the pressing needs of humankind.

The startup, that was set up two years ago, has built an indigenous bionic arm that does not only costs nearly 10 times cheaper at around Rs 2.5 to 3 lakh than the ones available in developed countries (Rs 30-60 lakh), but can also accomplish more number of tasks.

""There has not been much innovation in the prosthetics industry in India in the past couple of decades. But globally, innovation in bionics is moving at a very rapid pace and that is why we thought of working in this area,” says the 26-year old CEO and co-founder Pranav Kumar.

Explaining the working of a bionic arm, he says that unlike the conventional prosthetics arms available in the market that are either cosmetic in nature or are capable of limited movements like the myoelectric prosthetics, a bionic arm functions like a real one because of a better grip.

""Unlike a leg, the functioning of an arm is very complex. For instance, if you want to tie a shoe lace, the grip required is very different from that of the grip one needs to hold a bottle...,"" he says, adding that typically a bionic arm has 14 grips but the one developed by Kal Bionics has 16.

What is interesting is that Kal Bionics has not only ensured that its arm, named KalArm, has a better grip but it is 'smart' too. ""As and when we teach the arm more types of grips, KalArm will get updated on its own. Therefore, customers need not keep buying new arms,"" he says, adding that the arm can also be customised as per the unique requirements of the customer.

The startup has been testing its bionic arm for over three months and many of its features have been modified based on the feedback received from over 10 amputees using it. ""We have tested our product and now will be applying for certifications from the Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS). Once we receive it, we expect to launch KalArm by April-May this year, in India. And as and when we plan to hit other markets, we will also apply for that country’s specific certification,"" he says. The startup is also planning to set up an assembly unit in Hyderabad with a capacity to manufacture anywhere around 5,000-10,000 units a year.

Even as it gets ready to launch its bionic arm, the startup is gearing up to work on its next project of building exoskeleton, which can help paralyzed people or older ones move freely.

Hyderabad: When Gayatri Roy Choudhury, who was born without an arm, was asked about the first thing she would do if she got her arm back, she said she would hold her child. Similarly, when Venketesh, who had lost both arms in an accident, was asked the same question, he sheepishly said he wanted to scratch his forehead first.

And fulfilling these wishes is a homegrown startup, Kal Bionics Private Limited, that was set up by five friends, Pranav Kumar, Philip Thomas, Sai Prasad, Harsha Reddy and Suren to leverage technology to solve some of the pressing needs of humankind.

The startup, that was set up two years ago, has built an indigenous bionic arm that does not only costs nearly 10 times cheaper at around Rs 2.5 to 3 lakh than the ones available in developed countries (Rs 30-60 lakh), but can also accomplish more number of tasks.

""There has not been much innovation in the prosthetics industry in India in the past couple of decades. But globally, innovation in bionics is moving at a very rapid pace and that is why we thought of working in this area,” says the 26-year old CEO and co-founder Pranav Kumar.

Explaining the working of a bionic arm, he says that unlike the conventional prosthetics arms available in the market that are either cosmetic in nature or are capable of limited movements like the myoelectric prosthetics, a bionic arm functions like a real one because of a better grip.

""Unlike a leg, the functioning of an arm is very complex. For instance, if you want to tie a shoe lace, the grip required is very different from that of the grip one needs to hold a bottle...,"" he says, adding that typically a bionic arm has 14 grips but the one developed by Kal Bionics has 16.

What is interesting is that Kal Bionics has not only ensured that its arm, named KalArm, has a better grip but it is 'smart' too. ""As and when we teach the arm more types of grips, KalArm will get updated on its own. Therefore, customers need not keep buying new arms,"" he says, adding that the arm can also be customised as per the unique requirements of the customer.

The startup has been testing its bionic arm for over three months and many of its features have been modified based on the feedback received from over 10 amputees using it. ""We have tested our product and now will be applying for certifications from the Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS). Once we receive it, we expect to launch KalArm by April-May this year, in India. And as and when we plan to hit other markets, we will also apply for that country’s specific certification,"" he says. The startup is also planning to set up an assembly unit in Hyderabad with a capacity to manufacture anywhere around 5,000-10,000 units a year.

Even as it gets ready to launch its bionic arm, the startup is gearing up to work on its next project of building exoskeleton, which can help paralyzed people or older ones move freely.

A delegation meets Giani Harpreet Singh to seek his intervention in the matter

AMRITSAR: Punjab cabinet minister Tript Rajinder Singh Bajwa led a delegation of Sikh leaders to meet acting Akal Takht jathedar Giani Harpreet Singh. They sought his intervention to end the monopoly on the live telecast of Gurbani from Golden Temple and to facilitate the availability of a signal to all channels within the framework of guidelines.

Talking to mediapersons later, the panchayat and rural development minister said Gurbani was not a commodity and could not be traded. “The message of the gurus articulated in the Gurbani must be taken to every corner of the world for free rather than be made a business,” he said.

Saying that the jathedar assured him of looking into the matter, Bajwa condemned the monopoly rights given by SGPC to a TV channel owned by the SAD (B) president on the grounds that it violated the basic tenets and teachings of the Gurbani.

“The signal should be made available free of cost to every channel interested in spreading Gurbani after getting an undertaking on observing the norms laid down,” he said, adding that the SGPC should make its own arrangements for distribution of signal. He also pointed out that more than two decades after the proposal for setting up of a channel by SGPC, nothing had been done on the ground.

166,['15/02/2020'],Punjab: Parkash Singh Badal’s BJP jibe morale booster for SAD cadres,"This story is from February 15, 2020

Prakash Singh Badal

JALANDHAR: While political leaders and experts are trying to figure out the reasons behind Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) patron Parkash Singh Badal’s indirect jibe at ally BJP over “discrimination on basis of religion”, Akali cadres are feeling elated by it.

The boost of assertiveness has come at a time when Akalis were reeling under the treatment meted out to them by BJP in Delhi. The saffron party did not do well in Delhi polls, giving a breather to SAD. Akali cadres are happy that the former chief min-ster has sho-wn mirror to BJP, putting it in dock over its brand of politics. On the other hand, BJP functionaries may also find it tough to hit back at Badal given his age and stature, about which they themselves had been gushing.

SAD insiders said that they were happy at the remarks as BJP appeared to be embarrassing Akalis by moves in Delhi and also by asserting that in 2022, they would be the senior partner in the alliance in Punjab. The developments in Delhi had come when SAD was facing attacks from dissidents and Rajya Sabha member Sukhdev Singh Dhindsa had managed to bring them on one platform.

“These remarks have boosted morale of our cadres. Some had earlier called up to say that they were finding it difficult to explain party position to ground workers or people regarding Delhi poll drama. What’s more, sentiment in Punjab, especially among Sikhs, is against exclusion of Muslims from CAA and recent provocative statements by a few BJP leaders in Delhi elections,” said a SAD functionary, who also happens to be a SGPC member.

“It will also send a message to Punjab BJP leaders whose repeated statements to contest on more seats has been embarrassing Akalis,” said another Akali leader.

167,['15/02/2020'],Coronavirus scare: Where are the masks in Ahmedabad?,"This story is from February 15, 2020

Picture used for representational purpose only

Ahmedabad: With the city hosting large events with delegates from across the world, the first precaution many citizens thought of taking against the novel coronavirus (NCoV) when being exposed to crowds, was to get N95 masks, to prevent the spread of the virus that has claimed more than 1,000 lives.

If you go to the market and ask for the mask, chances are it will not be available. Owners of medical stores in the city say there are two reasons for the phenomenon — the first is the reluctance of smaller shops to stock these masks which are now selling for twice their usual price, and the the second is a lack of awareness about the protocols for NCoV.

Dashrath Patel, the owner of a medical store in the city, said that for the past few days stocks of genuine N95 masks are not being received. “Masks sold in the market today are not respirators, having a filter to arrest particles. Most of these are being imported from the US,” he said. “These masks are also no guarantee that one won’t get the infection. There is still a lot to know about NCoV.”

Many blame wholesale dealers. A pharmacist in Paldi said the masks were earlier available in the city for about Rs 100-130. “Today, these same masks are being sold for Rs 200-250. Is this not profiteering? It is largely due to the scare among the citizens and the lack of awareness about ways to prevent the viral infection,” said the pharmacist.

Jayendra Rana, the owner of a medical store in Vastrapur, said they are waiting for new stocks of masks to arrive while demand rises. “Several stores are selling surgical masks or non-N95 masks at a premium,” he said.

Medical experts had earlier said that the masks can prevent respiration of viruses and the accidental touching of hands to the nose and mouth.

168,['15/02/2020'],"After CAA, rise in number of applications forbirth certificates, some locals get fake docus","This story is from February 15, 2020

Bareilly: A large number of worried families, particularly from minority community, are approaching officials at the Bareilly Municipal Corporation (BMC) for their birth certificates and other documents since the recently amended Citizenship Act (CAA).

“In the past two months, we have been receiving nearly 200 applications for birth certificates every day - which is quite unusual. Earlier, on a given day we used to get only 20 such applications,” BMC health officer Sanjeev Pradhan said.

Moreover, with the locally authorised certificate centre, the Lokvani Kendra, not issuing birth certificates for over a year now, people are depending more on cyber cafes to enroll themselves on civilian registration system (CRS) and apply online for such documents, especially for children who are above one year old. Here, some people are being tricked by touts and a few cyber cafes. These cafes are said to be charging somewhere between Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 for “instant birth certificates”.

The BMC officials have also found several cases of fake birth certificates “issued by cyber cafes”. In fact, Pradhan has lodged a complaint with police to take action against those responsible for issuing such fake certificates.

Once a person is registered with the CRS after a year of the child’s birth, the individual has to go through a long procedure acquiring various certificates from the hospital to subdivision office to complete registration process on the CRS and get the birth certificate. Some parents, whose child is over two years of age, are now approaching touts who lead them to a cyber café which are issuing such fake birth certificates.

The BMC health officer explained, “Cyber cafes are not issuing proper certificates, but handing out a print out of a birth certificate of some other person where the name and address are usually doctored. These people are then contacting us to add their child’s name in the records. But, the certificates which they are providing are found fake upon scrutiny.”

Khalil Ahmad, an official at BMC health department, told TOI on Friday, “I have found at least six such cases so far following which I reported to my senior and registered a complaint with the police. Since, most of these fake certificates were issued to the people of Muslim community it cannot be denied that some cyber cafes are taking advantage of the people who are worried after the CAA.”

Meanwhile, municipal commissioner Abhishek Anand said that he would write to the police to know what action is being taken in the matter.

1,855 cases of dog bite have been reported at Bareilly district hospital in January alone

BAREILLY: A report by the state health department has revealed that 1,855 cases of dog bite , 166 cases of monkey bite, 27 cases of cat bite, 2 cases of horse bite and 1 case of crocodile bite have been reported at Bareilly district hospital in January alone.

The report further stated that a person died due to rabies in the same period. Officials said the actual number in the entire district is likely to be high.

The data was provided by the Bareilly district hospital after the health department asked the government and private hospitals, including military hospital and community health centres, to provide monthly data on dog, monkey and cat bites, and number of rabies cases.

District epidemiologist Meesam Abbas said, “As the centre has started national rabies control programme, the government is compiling data on dog bites and rabies across the country. The data being sought is very detailed, and once the data bank of such cases is being compiled at the country level, the government will come up with a plan and policy to control rabies. Besides, a few hospitals face a shortage of anti-rabies vaccine as the cases of dog bites are growing. With the compilation of data, the government will be able to know the actual number of vaccines needed and could ensure its supply.”

He added, “Only the district hospital in Bareilly has provided data on rabies to Integrated Disease Surveillance Programme (IDSP) cell in Bareilly for January. We will now educate other hospitals about the importance of the programme.”

Health officials said Virendra (35) who died due to rabies at the district hospital on January 26 was bitten by a stray dog when he was playing with the canine at Hafizganj village under Majhagav block of Bareilly district.

“Angry villagers killed the stray dog, but they did not take Virendra for anti-rabies vaccination. However, after a few months, he stopped drinking water and when his family brought him for treatment, he died due to rabies,” said Abbas.

According to World Health Organisation, rabies is an infectious viral disease that is almost fatal following the onset of clinical symptoms.

Dogs are the main source of human rabies death and the transmission of the virus is spread to people through bites or scratches, usually through saliva.

Experts said fever with pain and unusual tingling are the initial symptoms, but after the virus spreads to nervous system, it causes fatal inflammation of the brain and spinal cord. People with rabies also develop hydrophobia, and a change in behavior is also witnessed.

Chennai: The Madras high court has dismissed a plea challenging election of candidates to local bodies through draw of lots in case of tie. The procedure is not ultra vires of the Constitution and is permissible under law, the court said.

Dismissing the plea moved by K Devadass, the first bench of chief justice A P Sahi and justice Subramonium Prasad said, “To us, it appears that the legislature was conscious of such situations and, therefore, in order to provide a workable and operational system, and to avoid further uncertainty by prolonging the process through fresh elections , thought it appropriate to provide an additional vote amongst those who had secured equal number of votes by the draw of a lot .”

This wisdom of the legislature is in one way a logical solution by viewing the situation where two candidates have been found to be equally fit by the electorate to represent them as the village head. The voter’s interest being equally divided also amounts to reposing equal confidence in both the candidates. It, therefore, cannot be said one is inferior or superior to the other and, hence, democracy in its republican way is directly reflected through an exercise of franchise, where both the candidates have been selected by an equal strength of voters, the court added.

172,['15/02/2020'],AMC to introduce microbes to clean 61 nullahas discharging sewage into Yamuna,"This story is from February 15, 2020

Agra: To prevent discharge of 18 million litres per day (MLD) of sewerage from 61 small drains (nullaha) into the Yamuna every day, Agra Municipal Corporation (AMC) administration is going to use bioremediation and phytoremediation treatment process. In this regard, a survey has been initiated. The civic body administration has taken up the matter following National Green Tribunal (NGT) strict stand over the issue of waste management in the city.

Bioremediation refers to the use of microbes to clean up contaminated water, soil and sub-surface material. The microbes such as bacteria are introduced to use the contaminants as a source of food and energy and break down the pollutants.

Phytoremediation is a bioremediation process that uses various types of plants to remove, transfer, stabilize, and/or destroy contaminants in the water and soil. The plants are used for removal, degradation, and containment of contaminants in soil, surface waters, and groundwater.

Municipal commissioner Arun Prakash said, “We are working on a plan for remediation of contaminated water of 61 nullahas discharging sewage into the Yamuna, using naturally occurring plants and microbes. The system does not require construction or any major modification of drains or diversion of flow. It takes place in open drains without displacement of sewage. The bioremediation process also does not require any additional land or power, making it a simple and easy system.

“We have called an expert from Delhi to conduct a survey and help us in the process. Soon, a detailed plan will be prepared and sent to higher authorities for approval. Internationally, the technology has been used in several countries,” Prakash added.

Under the bioremediation process, bacteria is cultured in bulk and introduced in flowing sewage. Then, the microbes get activated and multiply—with or without oxygen -- using organic matter present in the sewage as food. Sometimes, enzymes are also added to activate the microbes.

AMC executive engineer (environment) Rajiv Rathi said, “Microbes consume the organic mass of the waste water and utilize the nutrients from sewage for their growth, ultimately enhancing the cleaning action of waste water. The treatment can restore water quality and increases the self-cleansing capacity of the water body. The process also helps reduce biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) in sewage and odour.”

CHANDIGARH: A SAD-BJP joint delegation met the Punjab governor on Friday urging him to direct the state government to immediately withdraw its affidavit filed in the Supreme Court in support of a separate gurdwara body for Haryana. The affidavit filed by the government claimed that the state assembly of Haryana was competent to enact a law after the Sikh Gurdwara Act, 1925.

The delegation also demanded a judicial inquiry to expose the alleged conspiracy of the Congress government to jeopardize the interest of Sikh community and the apex body for the management of shrines — SGPC.

The joint delegation also urged the governor to direct the Punjab government to immediately register a criminal case against minister Gurpreet Singh Kangar; adviser to CM Kushaldeep Singh Dhillon; and Manjinder Singh Dhillon for allegedly causing death of former Akali sarpanch Surjit Singh. Surjit was a witness in the Behbal Kalan firing incident. The delegation also demanded Kangar and Kushaldeep’s removal.

SAD president Sukhbir Singh Badal alleged that Surjit was mentally tortured and humiliated at the behest of the Congress leaders “who wanted to stop him from disposing as a witness” in the case in order to save accused policemen. “Kangar and Dhillon used one way or another to deter Surjit from giving testimony against the culprits by mentally harassing him through the discom officials by imposing heavy penalties, as well as, insulting his family members, including ladies,” Sukhbir alleged, adding these disclosures were made by the wife and son of deceased.

BJP’s Madan Mohan Mittal said not providing protection to a prime witness of an important case proved the malafide of the present Congress government in Punjab.

Representative image

MUMBAI: The Bombay high court on Friday made critical observations against tribal development secretary Manisha Verma that she was not diligent about the proceedings and did not completely understand implications of her statements in court.

The HC was hearing an eight-year-old public interest litigation filed through advocate Rajendra Raghuwanshi demanding an investigation into a Rs 6,000 crore scam in purchases of certain material by the tribal development department between 2004 and 2009. Following the HC’s intervention, a committee led by former Judge M G Gaikwad was set up to probe the scam, and it recently submitted its report.

The tribal development department, on its part, submitted a series of affidavits on the action taken against erring officials and institutions involved in the procurement of material.

“We need not refer to all faces of the probe, but presently we are concerned with another issue and that is primarily of not disclosing to the court the full details. We do not know why this principal secretary does not realize that if our orders are not read carefully and properly, possibly, she herself may have to lose out on prime postings and may face departmental action. She may have to quit office as well,” Justices S C Dharmadhikari and R I Chagla observed in their 17-page order.

“We do not think that we derive pleasure when we make this observation, but the way she files affidavits in this court leaves a lot to be desired. She must realize that when details are being placed before the court, it is bound to raise queries if the same are incomplete or there are gaps, which may not be a deliberate job. However, when the principal secretary says that out of 104 prosecutions, prosecutions against eight can not be launched as they have expired, whether these persons expired within the three-year period after the report was submitted or during pendency of action. As against the 96 persons, the affidavit does not say that these 96 have been named as accused for causing financial losses,’’ HC observed.

Further, the court observed her affidavit does not inform if 89 of the complaints have been converted into FIRs, how many arrests have been effected till date, how many have secured bail, when the charge sheet was filed and the status of the case, the judges remarked.

“This affidavit should therefore now set an example before all the officers how not to file affidavits with incomplete details. The highest court being misled means enormous blow to the reputation, dignity and prestige so also the status of the state as well,’’ they added. HC is expected to give final orders on the PIL on March 5.

177,['15/02/2020'],"Revenue custody death: Three months on, police yet to file FIR","This story is from February 15, 2020

Bareilly: The family members of Brijpal Shakya, who died in revenue custody in Sahaswan tehsil of Buduan district, staged a protest outside the district administration office on Friday, claiming that the police have still not filed an FIR against the sub-divisional magistrate (SDM) and others responsible for Shakya’s death despite an order by the court of Chief Judicial Magistrate (CJM).

Shakya, who was lodged in revenue jail for 11 days for his pending power bill of over Rs 80,000, died on October 3 after he allegedly fell ill while in detention. The issue went unnoticed until a few local leaders raised it after watching the video uploaded by Shakya went viral on social media.

Later, district magistrate Dinesh Kumar Singh sought a report from SDM Sanjay Kumar Singh, and suspended naib nazir Madan Mohan, kurk amin Ram Niwas and peon Kanhai Lal, whereas tehsildar Dheerendra Kumar Singh and naib tehsildar Raj Kumar Singh were attached with district headquarters, and were asked to provide a written explanation in three days.

A magisterial inquiry was also ordered in this case which was completed by additional DM Ram Niwas Sharma. However, the report stated that Brijpal died due to the negligence of the lower staff and not because of SDM or tehsildar.

Brijpal’s brother Mahesh Shakya told TOI that the administration is trying to ""save the culprits in this case.

“My brother had clearly said in the video that he was insulted and dragged inside the jail and kept without basic facilities like food and water. Even when he fell ill, the officials kept him in unhygienic conditions. He was shifted to a hospital only when he was on the verge of dying. The officials didn’t even share the autopsy report for two months and now they are not even following the court’s order.

When additional superintendent of police (rural) SP Singh contacted, he said, “We are following the court orders.” When asked why FIR has not been filed till now, the officer said, “We are only answerable to the court.”

When TOI contacted DM Budaun Kumar Prashant to inquire about the delay in filing FIR, he said, “The CJM court on January 28 ordered to register an FIR against the SDM, tehsildar and others for the death of Brijpal Shakya. We received the court order on February, and it was forwarded to the police. I am not aware why they have delayed in registering the FIR.”

He added, “The SDM and tehsildar have gone to the higher court to seek a stay against the lower court order. The investigation by our department suggests that Shakya had died because of the negligence of a lower staff who was responsible for maintaining the barracks. Necessary action has already been taken against him.”

Thiruvananthapuram: The report of Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) has vindicated the actions of revenue department till date, the office of revenue minister E Chandrasekharan said in a statement here on Friday.

He said that the audit report has said that in the five districts that have been selected for the examining, it has been found that out of total 23,15,13,770 hectares of surplus land, the revenue department has taken over 21,56,33,358 hectares, which comes to 93%.

Of the 24,967 cases for taking over of surplus land, only 169 cases are left out. These remaining are those which have been declared by the forest department has vested forests, those in which there are court stays and those which are under adverse possession that have been clarified in the audit report itself, the statement said.

While out of 169 cases, 64 are pending with the court, in 40 cases, the land has been declared as vested forest by the forest department, in 32 cases the land is in adverse possession and 15 cases are pending with the survey department.

Pune: The Samarth police on Thursday booked two fraudsters after they discreetly replaced a woman’s debit card with an inoperative one on the pretext of assisting her in withdrawing cash at an ATM in Nana Peth on February 5. Later, they withdrew Rs25,000 from the account.

Sadhana Shivle (50) of Shukrawar Peth had visited the ATM to withdraw Rs4,500 from her husband’s pension account. She put her card in the machine and typed the PIN but the transaction failed, an officer from the Samarth police said.

The fraudsters, who were standing behind her, striked a conversation with her. They told her the ATM did not contain currency notes of Rs500. They advised her to withdraw Rs4,000 instead.

The woman then put the card in the ATM, while one of the fraudsters diverted her attention and kept his hand on the card reader and replaced it with an inoperative one. Shivle walked out of the ATM after it did not dispense cash, the police said.

After Shivle reached home she received a text message stating that Rs25,000 had been debited from the account. On February 6, she visited the bank and inquired how much money had been debited. A bank official checked the account details and informed her that the debit card was used to withdraw cash.

The woman in her FIR stated that on checking the debit card Shivle realized that the fraudsters had tricked her by exchanging it with an inoperative one and stole her PIN to withdraw cash.

Assistant inspector Pervez Shikaljar of the Samarth police said, “Shivle filed a complaint application with the cyber crime police station immediately after the incident. The cyber crime police conducted a preliminary inquiry and transferred her application to the Samarth police.”

The woman gave the description of the fraudsters in her complaint. “We will write to the bank to get CCTV camera footage. We are working and certain clues,” he said.

Indore: BJP general secretary Kailash Vijayvargiya on Friday said that Indore was suffering from ‘Pitra Dosh’ (ancestors’ curse) which was hampering its development and a large statue of Lord Hanuman would be installed at Pitra Parvat to get rid of the same.

“We had invited some architects to Indore to know how its development can be carried out. They had informed that this city suffered from a curse. Just like people get rid of it, we started construction of Pitreshwar Hanuman Temple, offered prayers to Pitra (ancestors) and planted trees in their memory at Pitra Parvat to get rid of this dosh,” Vijayvargiya said.

The BJP general secretary was addressing a press conference on the starting day of 19-day-long ceremony to install 66-ft high statue of Lord Hanuman.

Vijayvargiya also reacted strongly to Rahul Gandhi’s tweet asking who was benefited the most from Pulwama attack and called him ‘naive’. “There are some subjects on which politics should not be done. Rahul Gandhi is naive. He should have not asked such questions,” Vijayvargiya said.

Talking about statement given by AICC general secretary Jyotiraditya Scindia in Tikamgarh on Thursday that state government should fulfil all promises made to people in its manifesto, Vijayvargiya said that he respected senior Congress leader’s courageous comments.

Reacting to Vijyavargiya’s comment that Indore was facing ‘Pitra Dosh,’ MPCC media cell chief Shobha Oza said, “Kailashji talks about setting the city on fire, then what ‘Pitra Doush’ is he talking about …. It’s beyond my understanding. Indoreans are proud of this city and they will not let wishes of such politicians be fulfilled.”

Ahmedabad: With insects forming an essential part of the diet of most migratory bird species, the alarming drop in insect numbers has raised concerns about bird migrations. A discussion paper in the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals, scheduled to begin from Saturday, has revealed that half of all insect species are declining rapidly, and many are threatened with extinction. The paper states that if there are no changes to the situation, then 40% of species of insects in the world will become extinct in the next few decades.

According to the study, insects are essential food resource for many vertebrate species that feed on them or depend on them for rearing their offspring. The report states that decline in number of insects can equally impact migratory insectivorous species, especially bats and birds. The report stated that some studies also reveal long-term loss in insect biomass on local level, up to a 76% decline in protected areas

The main drivers causing insect decline are habitat change and loss, pollution from synthetic pesticides and fertilizers, invasive species and pathogens, as well as climate change. “Insect biodiversity plays a vital role for functioning ecosystems, especially for insectivorous migratory species such as birds and bats,” says the report.

Most worryingly, these insect population drops are not only among rare species with narrow ecological requirements or restricted habitats, but also among species which were once common and widespread.

The discussion paper calls upon the scientific council is to assess the most important factors causing the insect population decline and evaluate its cascading effects on migratory insectivorous species. Further, the scientific council was also requested to consider the development of guidelines to improve the situation.

To combat insect decline, the draft resolution recommends a series of actions. These include increased scientific research to understand the impact of insect decline on migratory insectivorous animals. Scientists also recommend a precautionary approach with respect to the use of pesticides, especially in habitats important for migratory birds and bats. The report stated that caution has to be taken so that the food base of migratory insectivores is not harmed and action is taken to conserve insects.

Experts said luck too matters in sighting of tigers but tourists should look forward to enjoying the ecosystem... Read More

BAREILLY: A visit to Dudhwa Tiger Reserve (DTR) this year is proving to be a memorable trip for tourists as there has been a spurt in tiger sightings. Forest officials say at least one batch of tourists manages to spot a tiger every day. DTR boasts of nearly 100 tigers but these shy felines were rarely seen in the past.

Field director, DTR, Sanjay Pathak, told TOI, “Tigers are being sighted almost every day across the reserve either in the morning or evening shifts. The tiger sightings have increased here in comparison to three years ago.”

Giving reasons behind the rise in tiger sightings in DTR, Pathak said, “From December, we start grassland management and a large number of herbivores came out to consume fresh grass. Tigers too followed as they prey on herbivores. The tourists did not spot the big cats on days when it rained last month but as the weather has become clear, tigers are coming out to bask in the sun. Even in summer, herbivores come near water bodies to drink and the big cats lie in wait there to capture them.”

Fazlur Rahman, wildlife photographer who spends much time in the forest and has sighted tigers a few times over the past two months, said, “Better management by Dudhwa authorities and good population of tigers are the reasons why tourists are spotting tigers here.”

According to forest officials, UP governor Anandiben Patel who visited DTR in the first week of this month was able to “catch a glimpse of a tiger”. However, her family members “sighted a big cat”, they said.

In November last year, a few tourists who visited the reserve spotted a tigress along with its five cubs. However, for the protection of tigress and cubs, forest authorities have restricted movement of tourists on routes near its location. A tigress can become very aggressive in order to protect its cubs.

Experts said luck too matters in sighting of tigers but tourists should look forward to enjoying the ecosystem rather than focusing only on tigers. “Tourists should enjoy their visit to the forests and soak in the beauty of nature. They should not come with an aim only to see tigers,” said Pathak.

Leeladhar Sonu, a guide at Dudhwa, said, “It is a good sign that there has been increase in tiger sightings but the big cats are not the only the highlight of Dudhwa. Apart from tigers, tourists can spot rhinos, elephants, migratory birds and five types of deer.”

Forest officials, nearly 40,000 to 50,000 tourists visit DTR every year and they are expecting the same number this time.

Bareilly: Widely known for tiger safari in the country and abroad, Pilibhit set to get a bansuri as a landmark on the lines of newly-installed jhumka in Bareilly to promote the traditional flute industry among thousands of tourists visiting here every year.

Divisional commissioner Ranvir Prasad said, “The project is being considered under the UP government’s ‘One District One Product (ODOP)’ scheme to highlight the signature industry.”

The flute industry in Pilibhit is more than 150 years old and is known for producing handmade best-quality bamboo flutes mainly by Muslim artisans. According to a 1991 estimate, Pilibhit contributed 95% of flutes manufactured in India, and the instruments were in high demand abroad, including the US and European countries. The district is also known for making various types of flutes such as ordinary straight-blown flute, side-blown flute and Musical 1.

Speaking to TOI, Prasad said, “On the lines of Bareilly's jhumka, we are planning to develop a prominent crossing in Pilibhit as ‘Bansuri Chowk’ (Flute Junction) as a landmark. As the embroidery on Bareilly’s jhumka promotes city’s handicraft industry, besides being an attraction for tourists, the bansuri will also play a dual role of providing a landmark to Pilibhit city and promoting its traditional flute industry under the ODOP scheme.”

The Uttar Pradesh government launched the ODOP scheme to encourage locally-made specialised products and crafts. The scheme aims at promoting traditional industries synonymous with their respective districts to spur the local economy and create employment.

Taking about the bansuri project, Prasad said, “A survey will be conducted and based on which a prominent place will be finalised and developed as Bansuri Chowk. The modalities are yet to be finalised.”

Prasad said artisans in Pilibhit import bamboos from Assam to craft flutes. “But, plans are afoot to promote bamboo farming in Bareilly and Pilibhit districts. Forest department will also be engaged and we will see if the bamboo species currently being imported from Assam can be cultivated here.”

Meanwhile, Prasad on Wednesday visited Pilibhit, where he tried his hand at the ongoing wall painting, a drive launched by the Public Works Department (PWD), near Tanakpur highway.

Prasad said, “Recently, a drive under UP governments’ Paint My City scheme was launched in the district under which walls of most of the government buildings and offices are being painted with the images of bansuri. The campaign is aimed at making people aware of the rich cultural heritage of the city.”

Nashik: The Nashik Municipal Corporation (NMC) has deployed a trash skimmer machine to clean Godavari river. The machinery has been procured under the smart city project.

The one-year contract that was signed with the existing contractor is expiring on Feb 29 and the civic administration has decided not to renew the contract. Instead, they have decided to have a different approach to clean the river.

“We have now started mechanical cleaning of Godavari. A new trash skimmer machine has been procured for the purpose under the smart city project,” an NMC official said.

The official said that prior to this, the municipal corporation would manually clean the river and had appointed a private contractor for the same. “We would clean the river manually through contractor who was assigned with the task of removing water hyacinth, filth and other waste from the river. But the one- year term of the contractor is ending on February 29. We are not going to continue him after the contract ends,” the official added.

The cost of the machine is Rs 2.61 crore, including operation and maintenance for a period of 5.5 years.

Earlier, the municipal corporation would pay Rs 75 lakh per year to the contractor for manual cleaning of the river through boats.

Besides, there were some limitations to cleaning the river manually. However, using trash skimmer machine for cleaning will ensure faster and better results. The machine will operate in an eight hour shift from 9am to 5pm.

Apart from the trash skimmer machine, the municipal corporation has procured a robot machine which will be used to clean three tributaries of the Godavari — Nandini, Waldevi and Waghadi — in the city, said NMC officials.

“We are planning to buy two more robot machines to clean the Godavari and other three tributaries. We will put forth a proposal in the NMC budget for the next financial year 2020-21, they said.

Representative image

PUNE: Faraskhana police have registered offences against eight gold jewellery craftsmen for fleeing to their native place in West Bengal along with 600gm of gold bars collectively worth Rs22lakh.

Two goldsmiths from Peth areas have lodged separate FIRs with the Faraskhana police. The police have registered offence against the eight men under section 406 (criminal breach of trust) of the Indian Penal Code.

Y P Suryavanshi, sub-inspector, Faraskhana police, told TOI that Allahrakhha Shaikh, a 46-year-old goldsmith who also hails from West Bengal, had appointed four men for making gold ornaments at his shop in Raviwar Peth. The men had been working with him since March last year. “In December last year, he gave them 300gm of gold worth Rs11lakh and made proper agreements with the suspects. He even took post-dated cheques of the value of the gold from them as a precautionary measure,” he said.

Suryavanshi said that on December 31 last year, the suspects fled from the city along with the gold bars. “As the complainant Shaikh knew their native village, he went there to check but did not find them. He requested their family members to tell the suspects to return the gold and even informed the local panchayat there,” Suryavanshi said, adding, “When Shaikh did not get his gold back, he returned to Pune and lodged an FIR.”

The sub-inspector said that the probe revealed that the suspects have also duped some more goldsmiths.

Suryavanshi said on Wednesday that one more goldsmith, Dinesh Pavatekar, lodged an FIR stating that four gold jewellery craftsmen he had appointed fled with 300gm of gold bars worth Rs11 lakh. “Investigations revealed that the suspects were debt ridden and fled to West Bengal. Our probe is on,” Suryvanshi said.

Agra: Developed with an investment of Rs 75 lakh, the second smart city health centre commenced functioning at the old Women Hospital of Agra Municipal Corporation in Chatta locality here on Friday. The clinic, developed under the smart city project, will be a model centre for treating tuberculosis.

After inaugurating the health centre, Mayor Naveen Jain said, “Due to mismanagement, the civic body medical centres were non-operational for the past several years. Now, under the smart city project, clinics equipped with advanced machines are being set up. Two centres have been made operational. Soon, eight more centres will start serving citizens in different parts of the city.”

He added, “At all the eight smart health clinics, we will be providing medicines and diagnostic facilities at concessional rates up to 70%. Experienced doctors will be appointed at all the centres. Initially, the centres will operate from 10 am to 6 pm,” he said.

Apart from the low cost diagnosis, citizens will be able to consult a doctor (general physician) at the health centre by paying a nominal fee of Rs 50.

Besides the smart health clinics outside the AMC head office and Chatta locality, two other centres proposed to be made operational are located at Hanuman temple crossing in Khandari and Central Park in Awas Vikas locality. The remaining centres are proposed to be set up in Arjun Nagar, Fatehabad road, Trans-Yamuna, Kamla Nagar, Soron Katra and Freeganj

Pimpri Chinchwad: Municipal commissioner Shravan Hardikar on Friday urged civic employees to not shy away from lodging police complaints even against office-bearers and corporators in case of harassment or assault by such individuals.

Hardikar made this request while responding to a question about steps being taken to avoid recurrence of the recent incident when BJP corporator Asha Shedge and local residents locked up senior civic officials of water supply department on February 1.

The civic body had started alternate day water supply from November 25 to ensure equitable supply at good pressure, which failed to address complaints of poor supply. “We will lodge police complaints if civic officials and employees face harassment or are assaulted in their offices. But if such incident occurs outside, the individual must lodge a police complaint. I will firmly support such affected civic official and employee,” Hardikar said.

He said public outbursts could be prevented by taking timely action regarding complaints.

Rampur: District and sessions Judge Alka Srivastava on Wednesday directed the Rampur superintendent of police to provide adequate security to Khasbagh palace.

Directing SP Santosh Kumar Mishra to provide adequate police force for the security of the palace, said advocate Saurabh Saxena, the court ordered that all expenses incurred by the police force deployed at the palace would be borne by the family members of the erstwhile Rampur Nawab, who are parties in the case.

Eight months after the Supreme Court ordered distribution of Nawab’s property among his heirs, local administration and court-appointed commissioners are busy evaluating the assets.

Saxena said, “Following the SC’s directions, the evaluation of moveable and immovable properties is going on. In the presence of the family members and administrative officials, the armoury was opened for the counting of weapons. However, the strong room of the palace will be opened on February 26. Thus, the court directed the deployment of police force for the security of the property at Khasbagh.”

Khasbagh is under the possession of Muhammad Ali Khan, alias, Murad Mian, and his elder sister Naght Abedi, both children of the late Nawab Murtuza Ali Khan.

194,['15/02/2020'],"Rs50k cr &amp; counting, activist claims excess billing scam","This story is from February 15, 2020

Nagpur: Consumer activist Pratap Hogade has alleged over Rs50,000 crore excess billing scam in Maharashtra State Electricity Distribution Company Ltd (MSEDCL). He has urged Maharashtra Electricity Regulatory Commission (MERC) to take into account this fact while deciding the power tariff hike petition of the discom.

TOI has been repeatedly highlighting jugglery of figures by MSEDCL for the last 10 years. According to Hogade, the jugglery is done by the discom to cover up its failure in curbing power theft.

Hogade of Maharashtra Veej Grahak Sangathana (MVGS) told TOI that about 10 years ago when MERC started pulling up MSEDCL officials for failing to reduce distribution losses, they started inflating the consumption of unmetered farm pumps to artificially reduce losses. “It had a double benefit for MSEDCL as it also got more subsidy from the state government. Not stopping at this, the officials started issuing inflated bills to metered agricultural consumers,” he claimed.

When Chandrashekhar Bawankule of BJP became energy minister, he set up a three-member committee in 2015 to probe complaints of excess billing. He told the media several times that MSEDCL was issuing inflated bills to farmers. The committee was headed by MSEB Holding Company director Vishwas Pathak and Hogade was one of the members. The committee had asked IIT Bombay to conduct a field study to find out the actual farm pump power consumption in the state. The figures were so damning that Pathak refused to sign the final report in July 2017. The report has been gathering dust since then.

As pressure mounted on MERC to do something about excess billing, it set up a working group to investigate the scam. The group submitted its report to the commission in January 2020.

Hogade pointed out that as per MSEDCL’s claim, power consumption of low tension (LT) farm pumps in 2018-19 was 33,853 million units (MU). However, according to the working group report it was only 22,859 MU (67.5% of MSEDCL figure). Hogade feels the actual consumption is 50% of the discom’s figure.

“MVGS has arrived at this figure on the basis of a simple calculation. According to MSEDCL’s own data, the consumption of high tension (HT) agricultural pumps, which get water from lift irrigation schemes (LIS), is 117 units per HP per month. These pumps operate for 16 hours a day for 300 days a year. On the other hand, LT pumps in dryland areas of the state operate for nine hours a day at the most for 200 days a year. However, MSEDCL claims that their consumption is 113 units per HP per month, which is impossible. If the LT consumption is calculated on the basis of HT consumption, then it is 44 units per HP per month. Liberally, it may be 50 units, which is even less than 50% of the MSEDCL’s figure,” said Hogade.

The activist said that he has further proof of MSEDCL’s jugglery. “The discom had held farm pump bill correction camps all over the state. I have obtained data of 3,281 consumers under Right to Information (RTI) Act. Their bill, including arrears, before correction was Rs4.85 crore. After correction, it was reduced to Rs2.31 crore, which is 47% of the original figure,” he added.

According to Hogade, MSEDCL claimed that its distribution loss in 2018-19 was 14.7%. “If the actual farm pump consumption is taken into account, then the figure is 28.5%, which is 13.8% more. According to MSEDCL, 1% distribution loss leads to loss of Rs700 crore. So it is clear that the discom committed a scam of Rs9,660 crore in 2018-19 alone. If the figures of last 10 years are taken into account, then the scam is far above of Rs50,000 crore,” he said. Distribution loss is mainly due to power theft.

This jugglery is going on with orders from the top, suspects Hogade. In November 2011, executive engineer of Akola (Rural) division had written a letter to assistant engineer of Telhara sub-division rebuking him for calculating agricultural pump consumption on lower side.

There will be explanatory signs explaining these five senses, as also, depicting general information about the healing herbs and local wildlife.

WHAT THE CZA SAID

* Design of enclosure must be according to animal collection plan

* Availability of animals within Indian zoos and foreign zoos must be ensured

* Arrangement of proper circulation of water in wet moat should be made

* Care should be taken while using optimum space required

Representative image

RAMPUR: A court in Rampur has given bail to 26 anti-CAA protesters on Thursday. Hearing their bail pleas, court of district and sessions judge Alka Srivastava directed the protesters, who were arrested for their alleged involvement in the anti-CAA violence in Rampur on December 21, to furnish two bail bonds of Rs 1 lakh each.

Defence counsel Muhammad Rehman Ali, who appeared before the court, said, “The court had granted bail to 26 anti-CAA protesters and directed them not to tamper with any evidence and not influence witnesses. While granting bail, the court had also directed them to appear before the court whenever required.”

According to prosecution, the FIR complainant, Manoj Kumar (station officer of Bhot police station) had alleged that a mob of 300 to 400 people started gathering at Bareilly gate, raising slogans against the police and the Centre. They then allegedly fired on to the police deployed in the area and had been involved in arson and violence which resulted in “injury of cops on duty”.

The Ganj Kotwali police had arrested the anti-CAA protesters and sent them to jail under IPC sections 147 (rioting), 148 (rioting, armed with deadly weapons), 149 (unlawful assembly), 307 (attempt to murder), 333 (voluntarily causing grievous hurt to deter public servant), 353 (assault or criminal force) and sections 3 and 4 of the Prevention of Damage to Public Property Act, 1984. Section 7 of the Criminal Law Amendment Act (CLAA) was also invoked against the protesters.

Later, Amar Singh, the investigating officer of the case, had produced an application before the court in which he had stated that “no offence with charge of attempt to murder could be made out against 26 of the jailed protesters”.

Earlier, the court had granted bail to 15 protesters who were sent to jail after they were allegedly involved in the violence which erupted during anti-CAA protests at Hatikhana square in which one of the alleged protesters Faiz Khan was “shot dead”.

A magisterial probe had been ordered by Rampur district magistrate (DM) Aunjaneya Kumar Singh into the death of the 27-year-old Faiz Khan. Singh said that the probe was still on in the matter and “the appointed magistrate is out of town at the moment”.

The Rampur administration had also issued recovery notices to 28 alleged anti-CAA protesters after damages of nearly Rs 25 lakh was reportedly assessed by the police and the administration across the district.

198,['15/02/2020'],No invite yet for Anna for Kejriwal’s swearing-in ceremony,"This story is from February 15, 2020

Pune: Social crusader Anna Hazare has not received an invitation for the oath-taking ceremony of Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Sunday.

During his first tenure, Kejriwal had invited Anna for the swearing-in ceremony but Hazare, while offering his wishes, declined to attend citing health issues. “Even after this, Kejriwal called him, but Anna refused to answer his phone calls,” a close associate revealed.

He said no invitation has been received this time. When TOI tried to reach Kejriwal, his secretary said the chief minister is not speaking to any mediaperson.

On Tuesday, Hazare merely smiled and refused any comment after learning about Kejriwal’s landslide win in the Delhi assembly polls on February 11 and his oath-taking ceremony on Sunday.

“Anna has categorically stated that he will not comment on Kejriwal returning to office,” his secretary Sanjay Pathade told TOI on Friday. The Gandhian is observing ‘maun’ (complete silence) since December 20 to protest against the inordinate delay in executing the convicts in the Nirbhaya case and will break it only after they are hanged. “He writes his response on a piece of paper when he wishes to comment,” Pathade said.

Pathade had informed Hazare about Kejriwal’s win. “Anna wrote on a piece of paper asking for the party-wise break up. I told him that AAP has won 62 seats and the BJP 8. He smiled and wrote “Theek aahe” (okay). I told him the media wanted his reaction but he said he will not comment,” Pathade said.

However, residents of Hazare’s native village Ralegan Siddhi burst crackers to celebrate Kejriwal’s win on Tuesday. It was not too long ago that the villagers were upset with Kejriwal and BJP functionary Kiran Bedi for “deserting” Hazare and choosing to join politics much against his wishes. There was a feeling that they had used Hazare’s Lokpal movement in 2011 to come into the limelight and later ditched him.

But former associates said it was Hazare who had gained from the presence of Kejriwal and Bedi in his core committee. “They (Bedi, Kejriwal) have a clean image. They were good negotiators and useful while dealing with government officials. They added weight to the core team as they knew when to go back a couple of steps for long-term gains,” a former associate said. In their absence, Hazare has become too rigid and will have only limited success and support, they added.

Ralegan Siddhi villagers are happy with Kejriwal’s success. “We consider him one of us because he is a product of Anna’s anti-corruption and Lokpal movement. He was a regular visitor to our village,” a villager who was part of the celebrations said.

Hazare’s associates in the village said that though he has not “forgiven” Kejriwal, he does have a soft corner for him. “There is some softening of the heart. He says Kejriwal is better when compared with other politicians,” a close Hazare aide said.

He said Hazare still feels that Kejriwal cheated the “anti-corruption movement” by joining politics. “Anna wanted to create a permanent pressure group that will launch agitations on important issues. He thought that such a group can make any government take pro-people decisions. When the V K Shunglu commission report indicted the Kejriwal government in 2017 for bypassing the law, nepotism and financial irregularities, Anna was very upset,” he said.

During a previous interview with TOI, Hazare had said that he did not feel he was being used when member after member of Team Anna joined politics. “We live in a democracy. How can I pressure them into doing something? What matters to me most is the support of the common people,” he had said.

But the experience made him wiser, Hazare had said. “I have received over one lakh applications from people who wish to join me. Now, I insist on an undertaking stating that the individual will not use my name or photo for personal gain and he/she will not have connection with any political party,” he had said.

PUNE: Union minister Prakash Javadekar on Friday blamed the “sudden disappearance” of the Congress for the BJP’s defeat in the Delhi assembly polls.]He said it led to a direct fight between his party and the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP). He was speaking to the media on the sidelines of a District Development Coordination and Monitoring Committee meeting in the city on Friday.The Arvind Kejriwal-led AAP swept the polls by winning 62 of the 70 seats. The BJP won eight seats but the Congress did not win a single one.“Ours is a party that keeps learning. We learn from our victories and defeats. So an analysis of the defeat will be done,” Javadekar said.He blamed the BJP’s defeat on the Congress. “It is a different matter whether the Congress disappeared on its own or people made it disappear or whether their votes got transferred to AAP,” Javadekar said.“Because of the Congress’s disappearance, there was a direct fight between the BJP and AAP. We had expected 42% votes and 48% for AAP, but we got 39% votes while the AAP received 51% votes,” he said.He denied calling Kejriwal a “terrorist”. Earlier this month, Javadekar had said that Kejriwal had called himself an “anarchist” and there is not much of a “difference between an anarchist and a terrorist”.Union home minister Amit Shah on Thursday had said hate speeches like ‘goli maro’ and ‘Indo-Pak match’ made by some BJP leaders during the campaigning may have resulted in the party’s defeat.

200,['15/02/2020'],Karvy fails to keep another payment date with investors,"This story is from February 15, 2020

(Representative image)

HYDERABAD: With the second week of February drawing to a close, Karvy Stock Broking Ltd (KSBL) has missed yet another self-declared deadline for clearing its client payouts, leaving many of its investors in the lurch.

The beleaguered Karvy Group has now written to investors seeking time till February end to clear its dues. But most of them are not hopeful of seeing their money.

“We had earlier communicated to you that we will be affecting payment on or before February 15, 2020, based on the premise that the funding would be arranged by virtue of sale of our shareholding in one of our subsidiary companies. We would like to apprise you that we are in the final stages of raising the required sources, and unfortunately, though most details have been finalised, the remittances of the funds are taking time. We are confident that we will be in a position to affect payment of the amounts above on or before February 25, 2020,” said a communication by Karvy to investors.

When contacted, a Karvy group spokesperson confirmed that the company has sought time till the end of February to settle its payments to clients.

But what is even more frustrating for investors from smaller towns is that they have been ditched by their local Karvy agents, many of whom have quit because of non-payment of salaries.

“I am awaiting a payout of Rs 1.76 lakh, whereas my son is waiting for Rs 4.19 lakh. We are worried about our money as their local staff too has quit the company. We don’t know whom to reach out to and have no other option but to wait,” said Rakesh Verma, an investor from Raniganj in West Bengal. The father-son duo has been Karvy’s client for over 2.5 years.

Gautam Umaraliya, an investor from Bhavnagar in Gujarat, said he is not surprised about Karvy breaching its promise of clearing dues for the fourth time . “What surprises me is that such a big scam has broken out and market regulator Sebi is silent. This sends out a wrong signal as it will embolden other corrupt brokerages. Whether I will get back my money or not, I do not know, but one thing I know is that even if I get it back, I will be very cautious about investing in stock markets again,” he said. Since the Karvy scam broke out, his shares worth Rs 7 lakh have been out of bounds for Umaraliya.

While many are awaiting payments from Karvy, there are some investors who said they have received partial or token pay-outs in the last two weeks and are hopeful of receiving the residual sum in the coming days.

“The in-principle approval for revised Final Traffic and Financial Report presented in October 2019 for the new railway line between Pune and Nashik has been accorded by the CR general manager with certain observations,” Sanjay Kumar Jain, Chief Traffic Planning Manager (CR) said in letter sent to the executive director (works) of the Railway Board in New Delhi.

“As per guidelines the state government should provide the land free of cost for the tracks, but in the DPR the government has said it would share 20% of the entire cost. This needs further clarification,” the CR has said.

According to the revised DPR, the semi-high speed train with six passenger cars carrying 450 people is expected to complete the journey in 90 minutes. The CR, according to the DPR, plans to put six such rakes making 48 trips in both directions per day.

The CR has said with this only 7,200 passengers would be transported daily against the expected 21,600. “Hence, more planning of rakes has to be carried out to make the project viable,” it added.

The CR has also figured out that new freight terminals are also required to be constructed as the existing ones are either inaccessible or are insufficient to realise the movement of goods.

“The in-principle approval will definitely go a long way in ensuring the train service between Pune- Nashik begins at the earliest,” Member of Parliament (Nashik) Hemant Godse said.

“A meeting was held between the state government and the Railway officials in which both the parties have agreed to take several steps to expedite the construction of the tracks. The in-principle approval is the outcome of the same. As far as some observations are concerned, the state government and the Railways will sort them out at the earliest,” he added.

Strap: Anti-theft team attacked by villagers in UP's Bulandshahr, several critically injured

Meerut: An anti-theft team of the power department was attacked by local villagers in Bulandshahr’s Usmapur village after the team was returning from a checking drive on Friday morning. According to executive engineer Mahesh Updhyaya, it all began after the team reported theft at house of one Ajit Kumar.

When the theft case was pointed out by the team, Kumar became aggressive and misbehaved with the team. Another local resident also resisted to the checking drive and confronted the team. Later, when the team was returning after the drive, a mob of locals again confronted the team and allegedly attacked them with canes.

“Additional engineer Janaradan Yadav has sustained grievous injuries on his head and is currently admitted in a private hospital in critical condition. Several other officials have sustained injuries, including fractures. Had the PRD jawans at the spot not intervened, they [the mob] would have killed additional engineer Yadav,” executive engineer Upadhyay said.

According to sources, mob of cane wielding locals was assembled by two people who were reported for power theft. The team was attacked when it reached the location where it had parked its vehicle in the village.

Based on the complaint, police have registered an FIR under relevant sections against four named accused and 15 unidentified. Efforts are on to arrest the accused, police said. According to senior police officials, the attack on the raiding team was pre-planned.

“When the team at the spot tried to escape, they found the tyres of their vehicle were deflated and there was no fuel in the tank. Most of them had to abandon the vehicle and flee from the spot to save their lives,” Upadhyay added.

MEERUT: A wedding almost came close to be called off and at least 10 people landed in a hospital after two uncles of the bride opened fire in celebration in a Meerut village. The incident occurred on Wednesday night, which also led to a clash between the bride and groom’s families. The injured were rushed to a health centre and were later released after first-aid.

The marriage was solemnized after intervention from the elders. However, on Thursday evening, an FIR was filed by the groom’s side. The incident occurred in Kheri village near Daurala block of Meerut where Shubham Singh’s baraat reached bride’s house and during a ceremony shots were fired by the licensed weapons of bride’s uncles-- Naresh and Yashpal. This resulted in clashes between the two groups.

Daurala’s station officer Janak Singh Chauhan said, “FIR has been filed by the groom’s brother Nishant. It seems the accused were under influence of alcohol. Investigation is on.”

As of now, the two accused are absconding.

The use of weapons in weddings and election victory processions is rampant in western UP districts despite a high court order in 2012 restraining arms license holders of Uttar Pradesh from using weapons for celebratory firing.

“We have given strict orders to all police officials of the zone to act swiftly and strictly on these matters. Firstly, if anyone is found involved in celebratory firing, not only a case will be filed against him but his weapon will also be impounded, and within 24 hours cancellation of license will be done. Even the organizer of the event will not be spared in that situation and similar penalty will be slapped upon him,” said ADG Police Meerut zone, Prashant Kumar.

Kannur: The Constitution protection rally — organized by various Muslim organizations under the banner of Constitution protection committee against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) — that was supposed to begin from St Michael’s school ground had to shift its starting point to Vilakkathara near Prabhat Junction after the Army denied permission on Friday.

Army officers said that the land belongs to Defence Security Corps and hence permission was denied. But organizers claimed that this was not intimated earlier and permission was denied as it was anti-CAA attended by one lakh persons.

Organizers said earlier there were no objections for using the ground for such rallies and even people used to park vehicles there and police too were unaware of the same. The Army also deployed its personnel well before the start of the programme, they added.

But, sources close to the Army said a decision was taken to not give the ground for programmes. Earlier, parades were held there in the morning. Later, people started using it as if it was an open ground, sources said.

Public Works Department claims that the stretch was recently repaired under its streetscaping plan

NEW DELHI: It’s a bumpy ride for some 50,000 commuters who travel daily between Supreme Court Metro station and Oberoi Flyover on the busy Mathura Road. While the entire length of 3.3km is riddled with potholes, the ongoing construction work near Pragati Maidan further reduces the width of the road. The entire journey, which should typically take less than 10 minutes, often lasts nearly half an hour, resulting in frayed tempers.

Public Works Department claims that the stretch was recently repaired under its streetscaping plan and the heavy traffic volume is to blame for its poor condition. A more plausible explanation may be the huge number of trucks that come in at night carrying materials for the Pragati Maidan redevelopment project. “Because the construction work is on, repairing big potholes will further hinder traffic movement. It’s difficult to repair the road because many trucks use it at night. We are waiting to get a clear window so that we can repair all potholes at one go,” said a PWD official who didn’t want to be named.

TOI did a reality check on Friday and found potholes at almost every 50 metres. The trouble started from Pragati Maidan Gate No. 5 where a massive dent on the road greeted us. A vendor stationed there told us that two-wheelers losing their balance at the spot wasn’t an uncommon sight. “The situation is worse during monsoon. The road is repaired once in a while, but is damaged very quickly,” he said.

Barely metres ahead, the road turned slightly towards the left due to underpasses being constructed there. These U-turns are a part of the Pragati Maidan redevelopment plan. The left turn started with a pothole and things didn’t get better until one came back to the main road. It was a crawl till DPS (Mathura Road), with there being many potholes even near the upscale Sundar Nagar.

Kuldeep Singh, a regular commuter, told us: “There are potholes all along the stretch. First, the width of the roads is uneven, which causes bottlenecks, especially during the peak hours. Who will believe that this is south Delhi?”

Supreme Court had recently taken cognisance of the dangers posed by pothole-filled roads. It had remarked that the death of nearly 15,000 people in road accidents in the past five years across the country due to potholes was probably higher than those killed on the border, or by terrorists. The deaths indicated that the authorities were not maintaining the roads properly, the court had said.

While PWD officials expressed helplessness in finding a solution to the problem, Delhi Metro, which has had been involved in massive construction activity across the city in the past two decades, seems to have cracked the code. The challenges faced by DMRC are similar, but it has usually managed to keep the roads in good shape. A senior DMRC official explained: “We barricade the areas where work is on. If there are any potholes, we fill them overnight. It just takes a couple of hours.”

Vadodara: The Indian rupee may have slipped against US dollar, but one particular currency note of that denomination in possession of a Gujarati antique dealer is truly worth a million dollars.

Tejpal Shah, a numismatist from Vadodara, has a collection of unique one rupee notes, among which one carries US president Donald Trump’s birth date. The series of the currency note 08N 140646 — an uncanny match to Trump’s birth date and year — June 14, 1946!

Owner of the unique note has something to trump about literally, which he wishes to do when Trump comes to Gujarat on February 24 along with PM Narendra Modi. Shah wants the unique currency note to be displayed at Motera stadium.

“I had been in possession of this currency note for the past two decades. When Trump announced his visit to India, I immediately took out my collection and found this significant note,” 57-year-old Shah told TOI.

In fact, Shah also has another one rupee note whose series matches with Modi’s birth date and year, 17-9-1950. “It is mere coincidence that I have such unique currency notes that had been printed in 1988,” Shah said.

“I frequent flea markets as well as coin and currency note market,” said Shah, when asked how he managed to get these unique currency notes. He said that he went to one such market in Mumbai around 20 years ago and laid his hands on the birthday bundle of notes. My collection has 100 currency notes of one rupee in the same series with same inset. Who would have thought that someday these notes would become unique for its similarities to the birth dates of two powerful political leaders?”

An engineering graduate, Shah’s interest in antique artefacts as well as numismatics is a 25 year old story. “It began as a hobby and soon I accumulated a good collection. I also have notes with number series matching birth dates of some popular Bollywood stars too,” Shah added.

Tom Jose

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Levelling a veiled and serious attack against accountant general S Sunilraj, the state government finally responded to allegations levelled in the CAG audit report that was tabled in the assembly on Wednesday. Chief secretary Tom Jose, in a statement issued on Friday night, alleged that the details of CAG report might have been leaked before the report was submitted in the assembly.

“There are doubts about details of CAG report getting leaked before the report was tabled in the assembly. Normally, media and others access such reports after they are tabled in the assembly. Now, doubts have risen that a few details of the report have been leaked out,” the CS said. Though he didn’t clarify about the leaking of crucial info, which is a serious breach of the confidential nature of the report, his statement was strikingly similar to the allegation levelled by CPM mouthpiece Deshabhimani on Friday. “There is information that the report had been leaked to some UDF centres before being tabled in the assembly,” the report published in Desbhabhimani said.

Jose said the criticism against various departments in the audit report would be examined by the departments concerned and replies would be furnished. “The public accounts committee comprising legislators will examine the report. The report examines audits for 2013 to 2018 in various departments during the tenure of two governments,” he said. It is learned that the PAC has initiated action on the report. Notices to all departments mentioned in the report would be issued soon and the PAC will meet once the clarifications from the departments are received.

The chief secretary also criticised the practice of putting a few officials in the dock based on the remarks in the audit report. “It is the constitutional responsibility of the CAG to refer the audit details to the assembly and Parliament. But, it is not a good precedent to blame a particular official based on the findings in the report. There are certain procedures for examining the report and addressing the issues raised. Attempts to accuse somebody and put them under media trail without waiting for the due process is a breach of democratic courtesy,” he added.

A meeting of CPM state secretariat held here on Friday is also learned to have decided to ignore the controversy triggered by the CAG report.

Nashik: Around 3,500 lawyers from across the state and the neighbouring state of Goa have registered for the State Lawyers Conference , 2020 to be held in Nashik over the weekend.

President of Nashik Bar Association Nitin Thakare said that 1,000 more lawyers were expected to attend the conference. “The theme of the conference is ‘marching towards speedy modern judiciary’. While the lawyers at the convention will brainstorm various ways and means to achieve the aim of a speedy and modern judiciary system, the need for additional courts and infrastructure will also be given expression at the conference,” said Thakare.

“Since Chief justice of India Sharad Bobde will be attending the state-level conference, lawyers will be requesting him to consider their demand of setting up a bench of the high court at every revenue head quarter and benches of the Supreme Court in Mumbai, Chennai and Kolkata,” said Thakare.

Citing that there were a pile of cases pending in many courts, Thakare said that there were more than 28,000 pending cases in Nashik alone.

Chairman of the Bar Council of Maharashtra and Goa Avinash Bhide said, “Lawyers will think of ways in which the information technology and social media can be used for speedy disposal of cases.”

Methods like using Whatsapp for sending summons to the concerned people instead of issuing them physically, video recording evidence when submitted in court, setting up CCTV cameras in court halls are among a host of factors that would be discussed at length at the convention, said Bhide.

Meanwhile, chief minister Uddhav Thackeray and Supreme court Justice Bhushan Gavai will lay the foundation stone of a new court building on Sunday morning.

The new court building will have seven floors, while an additional four-storey building will be constructed for parking vehicles. Both the buildings will be constructed at an estimated cost of Rs 172 crore.

Trichy: The city police are probing the incident in which five students of a private college were allegedly robbed of their expensive mobile phones by a gang which arrived in two cars around midnight on Thursday. The postgraduate students said they were heading to the room of one of their mates by car when the incident happened near the government circuit house.

Cantonment police launched an inquiry with the five students on Thursday night itself. Four of the students were staying in the college hostel while one was residing outside. All of them are natives of Kerala staying in Trichy for studies. The students said they were on their way to the room of one of the students near Sengulam colony around 2 am. As their car neared circuit house, six people arrived in two cars and intercepted them.

The students told the police that the gang snatched two high value mobile phones from them by pointing an airgun. The students claimed that the gang sprayed some liquid on their faces and fled in their cars. The police team recovered some of the pellets of the gun at the spot. With the students giving contradictory statements, city police commissioner V Varadharaju inquired with the students in the morning on Friday.

Later, the police managed to find the five students roaming near Trichy international airport around 11pm after parking their car on Wireless Road for nearly an hour, after which they left the airport. When asked why they visited the airport so late at night, some of them replied that they went there to see the flights.

Unwilling to buy the theory, the officials launched a probe into the incident suspecting the activities of the students. The officials were suspicious as to why the gang should target only those students by following them in cars to snatch mobile phones. The students were initially reluctant to file a complaint but agreed later in the evening. Police said they were likely to register a case in Cantonment police in the night.

Explaining its stand on the issue, the Union government told the high court that the state government’s decision is in violation of the provisions of Right to Education (RTE) Act.

Arguing on behalf of the Union government, assistant solicitor general B Krishna Mohan told the court that according to RTE Act, the preferred medium of education should be the mother tongue. He said the implementation of compulsory English medium is contrary to the central Act.

BJP chief spokesperson of Andhra Pradesh Srinivas Sudhish Rambhotla and Dr Guntupalli Srinivas moved separate PILs challenging the implementation of English medium from primary level. They also argued that the state government’s decision is illegal and in violation of RTE Act and various judgments given by the Supreme Court in the past.

The state government, on the other hand, justified the move saying that the decision was taken after demands from the parents to give quality education to children from poor economic background. The state government told the high court that opinions were sought from parent committees of more than 47,000 schools and that about 97 per cent of committees were in favour of English medium.

Those who moved implead petitions in support of the state government’s decision have also argued that the implementation of English medium would help children from marginalised sections of the society in the present competitive world. They argued that poor people cannot afford to send their children to private schools and English medium teaching in government schools was a way of ensuring social justice.

After hearing arguments from all sides, the high court bench headed by Chief Justice JK Maheswari and Justice Ninala Jayasurya reserved the judgment.

The Madras high court has issued notice to the state government on a public interest litigation (PIL) seeking to appoint technicians to handle dialysis equipment at all the government hospitals in the state.

In his petition, K Pushpavanam, a resident of Madurai, stated that as per the guidelines, dialysis equipment should be handled by a qualified technician. There should be one qualified technician to handle three machines, however, an RTI report reveals that only seven dialysis technicians are appointed in government hospitals and that too on temporary basis.

If the dialysis machines are handled by unqualified people, then it poses a threat to the patients who are undergoing dialysis at the hospitals as there are chances of the patients getting transmission of Hepatitis B and Hepatitis C. Due to improper handling of the equipment, nearly 20 people who underwent dialysis at the Stanley Medical College at Chennai were affected with Hepatitis C in 2014.

Hence, the petitioner moved the high court Madurai bench seeking for a direction to appoint technicians to handle dialysis equipments and to install new dialysis units in all the government hospitals in the state. The petitioner also sought for a direction to administer vaccination for Hepatitis B and Hepatitis C for all dialysis patients on a regular basis.

Hearing the plea, a division bench of justice M Duraiswamy and justice T Ravindran issued notice to the state government and adjourned the case to a further date for hearing.

Madurai: Expressing shock at the final report (charge-sheet) filed by the police with regard to closing a case as ‘mistake of fact’, the Madras high court has directed the Pudukottai superintendent of police (SP) to appoint an officer at the rank of DSP to conduct investigation into a case where few people were assaulted during a dispute while conducting a temple festival at Pudukottai in 2016.

Justice G R Swaminathan passed the order on a plea moved by G Kanagaraj seeking to transfer the case to CB-CID or any other competent agency.

The judge observed that the petitioner is the complainant in the case which was registered by the Keeramangalam police station in Pudukottai district. As many as 10 people have been named in the FIR. The judge noted that the petitioner had filed this petition as he expressed dissatisfaction over the manner in which the investigation was conducted.

When the matter was taken up for final disposal, the government advocate submitted that the inspector of police had already filed a final report closing the case as ‘mistake of fact’ and a copy had been served to the petitioner. The government advocate also mentioned that the final report is yet to be taken on file by the jurisdictional magistrate.

The judge observed that the petitioner’s counsel contended that during village meeting which was convened over the dispute in conducting temple festival in 2016, the people named in the FIR brutally assaulted the petitioner and others in which the petitioner suffered a fracture on his left hand.

On perusal of the discharge summary which has been enclosed, the judge said that the petitioner was an inpatient at the government hospital at Pudukottai for 30 days and several others also suffered injuries in this incident. The judge noted that the materials on record clearly indicate that the petitioner and others were brutally assaulted.

NEW DELHI: Three owners of a realty firm were arrested by Economic Offences Wing (EOW) of Delhi Police for duping scores of buyers through a housing scam in which they had offered Delhi Development Authority (DDA) flats at Dwarka under a central government scheme.

The scam was first reported by TOI after which a Special Investigation Team was formed to probe the case. Joint commissioner (EOW) OP Mishra said that the accused — Satender Maan, Pradeep Shehrawat and Subhash Chand — were found to be senior office-bearers of Revanta Multi State CGHS Ltd, which was used to put out the advertisements regarding the scam.

The scamsters attracted homebuyers for investment in lucrative DDA housing schemes through SMS or online advertisements. Potential buyers were asked to pay “development charge” to apply in a lucky draw for the flats. However, they were neither allotted a flat nor refunded the money.

The probe found that approximately Rs 400 crore was collected from 3,997 investors in the name of providing housing under DDA’s land pooling policy in Dwarka.

“The land was purchased at very high rates, reaching up to Rs 10 crore per acre against the circle rate of Rs 53 lakh. Land facilitation agencies were incorporated and direct deals with farmers were avoided to siphon off approximately Rs 115 crore,” said Mishra.

During interrogation, the accused said that they posed as authorised agents offering flats on behalf of DDA. It was found that DDA had never given authorisation to their firm to issue advertisements.

Police have registered 16 more cases against builders found cheating people in the name of handing them DDA flats.

An inquiry into the scam was started after police received a complaint from Rewant Kumar Mishra, a resident of Sangam Vihar. Subsequently, an FIR was lodged for criminal conspiracy, criminal breach of trust and fraud against Revanta Multi State CGHS Ltd located in Sector 23 Dwarka.

Mishra told police that in 2015, he had come across an advertisement that the company was going to build residential flats through land pooling in Dwarka’s L-Zone. A separate inquiry was also conducted by DDA and the report was submitted to police.

Sangrur: Two days after a local contractor disconnected the water supply to Dalits of Tolewal village over some pending dues, a team of Punjab State Scheduled Castes Commission led by member Poonam Kangra visited the affected village on Friday. The team also directed the district administration to file a detailed report into the incident.

Kangra, who interacted with the villagers, assured them that action would be taken against those found guilty of disconnecting the water supply. She also heard other problems of the locals and directed the district administration officials to look into the matter. The residents alleged that they had been facing water supply problems for the last four months and informed Kangra that as they could not even afford submersible motors as they were now left without any water for their daily needs.

Officials of the district administration said local contractors had disconnected the water connection over some pending dues. The connection was restored the moment they came to know of it, deputy commissioner Ghanshyam Thori said.

However, the locals alleged that the water supply had been stopped by some members of upper caste families.

Dalits and upper caste families in the village have been at loggerheads for the last many years at Tolewal village. In July last year, the two communities had clashed over the auctioning of village common land.

Trichy: Farmers and locals in Pudukottai district celebrated on Friday as soon as deputy chief minister O Paneerselvam announced the allocation of Rs 700 crore in the first phase for the Cauvery-Vaigai-Gundar river linking project in the assembly.

The budgetary allocation on Friday sets stage for the commencement of a project, which is said to be over a century-old demand. Cauvery-Vaigai-Gundar river linking project involves the construction of 255.60 km long canal from Mayanur in Karur district to link Cauvery with Vaigai.

The link canal will run through the districts of Karur, Pudukottai and Trichy, Pudukottai, Sivagangai, Ramanathapuram and Virudhunagar districts. Gundar river flows in Virudhunagar and Ramanathapuram districts.

However, Pudukottai will benefit the most from the project. A 119-km-long canal connecting Cauvery to south Vellar estuary will bring water to 760 tanks in Pudukkottai district thereby helping to irrigate 20,249 hectares of agriculture land. The project will also benefit over 100 villages in 12 taluks of Pudukottai district.

Even before the allocation of funds for the project, health minister C Vijaya Baskar organized a meeting on Wednesday thanking chief minister Edappadi k Palaniswami for announcing the project last year.

Farmers along with locals gathered in Ulavar Santhai to distribute sweets apart from bus stands and markets to celebrate the announcement. With no proper source of water for farmers in Pudukottai district, the announcement has been historic, said S Ayyappan, a farmer.

Trichy: Trichy rural police arrested two people for attempting to rob Tasmac employees at gun point near Thiruverumbur on Thursday. A pistol and two rounds of bullets were seized from the two who are natives of Tirunelveli district and their bike was also confiscated.

Thuvakudi police arrested M Dison alias Sebastian Dias, 28, of Mattapuram near Nanguneri and M Sri Murugan of Thisaiyanvilai. The police pinned them down during a vehicle check at Thuvakudi on Thursday morning. The duo came on a bike to a Tasmac shop at Anna roundabout near Thuvakudi around 11.30 pm on Wednesday with Sri Murugan riding pillion. Tasmac employees T Arunagiri and K Sugumar were about to start their bike to go home when Dison and Murugan intercepted them and asked for liquor. The employees replied that the shop was closed. The next moment, the pillion rider took out a pistol from his bag and pointed at them demanding the cash in their bag. Police said they were under the impression that the employees had the day’s collection in the bag.

Seeing this, shop supervisor N S Murugadass came running while the two employees also screamed for help even as Sri Murugan threatened to shoot them. The employees however opened the bag and showed them. Since there was no cash in it, the duo left the place. Murugadass lodged a complaint with Thuvakudi police on Thursday. The police team led by inspector Gandhimathi conducted a vehicle check and intercepted two men on a bike on suspicion. Gandhimathi said on Friday that both of them were involved in various offences.

Kochi: The proceeds from the ticket sales of the musical event ‘Karuna’ were deposited to the Chief Minister’s Distress Relief Fund (CMDRF) on Friday, programme organizer Kochi Music Foundation (KMF) said.

KMF made the announcement on its Facebook page late on Friday after TOI published a report ‘Karuna was a hit but where is the money?’

The report said the KMF had not remitted the proceeds from the star-studded relief fund-raising event to the CMDRF. The event was held at the Regional Sports Centre’s Rajiv Gandhi Indoor Stadium here on November 1, 2019.

The Facebook post, “by Bijibal and Shahabaz Aman for KMF”, said the proceeds from the sale of tickets were Rs 6,22,000, after deducting GST. This amount was deposited to the CMDRF, the post said, adding that the expenses for conducting the event was Rs 23 lakh. Incidentally, tickets were priced in the range of Rs 500 to Rs 2,000.

The post also mentioned that the artistes had performed for free at the full-house event and the venue was also given free of cost.

The stadium with a playing area of 20,000 sqft, has a capacity to seat 10,000 people, according to the RSC’s website.

The KMF also said it had requested the district collector time till March 31 to deposit the money to the CMDRF.

Responding to TOI over WhatsApp on Thursday, Bijibal had said the money would be remitted to the relief fund before March 31.

Detailing the delay, in Friday’s Facebook post — the previous one was on November 4, 2019, which said that ‘Karuna’ was “a success beyond our expectation” — KMF said it was in talks with a few media houses to market the edited content of the event, but nothing materialized. Also, political issues of national importance such as CAA, NRC and NPR demanded priority attention and that, too, affected KMF’s plans, the post said, adding that the current criticism against it was triggered by “divisive forces,” enraged over the participation of Foundation members in anti-CAA protests.

Trichy: Regional joint director of collegiate education (RJDCE) S Usha was sent on forced leave on Friday following complaints of physically assaulting her subordinates. Director of collegiate education (DCE) in-charge C Jothi Venkateswaran passed the order based on written complaints from employees in this regard.

On Thursday, two women employees had accused Usha of physically assaulting them after finding fault with their work. One of them, a stenographer in the office, was slapped by her on her back for making a spelling mistake. The woman was so traumatised that she had to be admitted to hospital after the incident. The other woman alleged that she was slapped by Usha when she requested her to process a file that had come from one of the aided colleges in the city.

Members of ACTA protested in front of the RJDCE office on Friday against the incidents demanding that the higher education secretary sack Usha. ACTA general secretary S Sahaya Sathish said Usha is incapable of continuing as RJDCE as only people who lose their mental balance can physically assault subordinates. She had insulted many teaching staff of aided colleges in the past. “A mere forced leave or transfer to other regional joint director office will make the staff in that office vulnerable to such attacks. Therefore, we seek her termination from service,” said Sathish.

Police are probing whether the copy of the cheque submitted to the PNB branch was genuine or not (File photo)

NEW DELHI: Ten people were arrested in Karol Bagh after a gang tried to fraudulently withdraw Rs 12 crore from Punjab National Bank in the name of an NGO. The mastermind of the racket used a cheque of Everest Bank in Nepal that has a collaboration with PNB to transfer the money to the NGO’s account.

A police probe revealed that the gang had managed to get access to the Nepal-based bank’s secured vaults and get the cheque that was used for the transaction.

Additional CP (central) Mandeep Singh Randhawa said that they had received a complaint regarding the fraud from the branch manager of PNB at Karol Bagh. The huge amount involved in the transaction and interaction with the accused had raised doubts in the manager’s mind.

A team led by SHO Maninder Singh was subsequently formed to probe the source of the cheque. It was found that two men, Abhishek Kumar and Ashok Panwar, had gone to the bank to deposit the cheque. “We interrogated the two men and found that the cheque was handed over to them by another person named Kamal. A further probe revealed that it had changed many hands. Each of the person claimed that they were promised Rs one crore from the share amount,” added Randhawa.

The cops tracked down six other people identified as Kul Bhushan, Lokender Rao, Amit Markal, Abdul Kadir, Jyotika Bhonsale and Shravan Yadav to finally reach the mastermind, Prem Narayan Pandey.

Pandey had managed to get the secured account of Everest Bank. The Nepal-based bank had opened an account in its name at the PNB in Karol Bagh branch. Pandey decided to dupe it using a cheque he is suspected to have stolen from the Everest Bank headquarters. Police are probing whether the copy of the cheque submitted to the PNB branch was genuine or not.

Cops have registered a case of forgery and cheating. The authorities concerned in Nepal have been informed.

Nashik: Two youths were killed and one was critically injured when the bike they were travelling in was knocked down by a speeding truck in the Nashik Road area on Friday afternoon.

Adarsh Rohidas Karad (18) and Akash Gavali (22), both residents of Vijay Nagar near Chehedi pumping, Nashik Road, died on the spot. Dnyanesh Balu Kedare (24), a resident of Nashik Road, was admitted to Nashik Road Bytco hospital.

Senior inspector at Nashik Road police station (first name) Bijli said that a truck was speeding on the road towards Chehedi pumping Kharjul Mala, opposite Gajanan park, close to the Nashik-Pune highway. After running over the bike, the truck driver fled the scene.

“We have seized the truck and brought it to the police station. We believe the truck driver will surrender soon,” said Bijli.

Meanwhile, residents of Kharjul Mala who saw the accident said a school van arrived from one lane and hit the motorcycle, after which the three youths fell down. The truck driver entered the Chehedi pumping road from the Nashik-Pune highway. He could not bring the truck under control and ran the vehicle over the three youths.

Residents of the area said that the road is narrow with farm lands on either side. Mangesh Khalkar, a resident of the area, said the road where the accident took place was wide enough.

According to residents in the area, only two people were on the bike. Kedare, who escaped with injuries, was walking past in the area. Police are yet to ascertain the chronology of events before the accident.

Khalkar added that Gavali had his engagement ceremony in a few days.

Over the past five years, a large number of residential buildings have come up on the Chehedi pumping road, reducing the width of the road. Traffic bottlenecks are common in this stretch of road whenever a car and a bus come from opposite directions.

Citing that many people have met with fatalities on this stretch of road, residents here have expressed the need for increasing the width of the road.

Madurai: The Madras high court has directed the authorities concerned to consider a representation moved by a non-judicial member of the Tamil Nadu State Consumer Dispute Redressal Commission (TNSCDRC) seeking payment of revised salary as per the Consumer Protection (Appointment, Salary, Allowances and Conditions of service of President and Members of the State Commission and District Forum) Rules, 2018 and to disburse the same along with all allowances and arrears. Justice M S Ramesh passed the order on a plea moved by S M Murugeshan who was appointed as permanent whole time non-judicial member of TNSCDRC in the circuit bench inside Madurai district court premises. The judge also made it clear that the court has not expressed any of its view with regard to the claim made by the petitioner and it is for the authorities to consider it in accordance with law.

The judge observed that the petitioner had stated that he had already made a representation to the authorities concerned on November 22, 2019 which was said to be kept pending. The judge noted that if the said representation is directed to be disposed of within a stipulated time, the ends of justice could be secured. “Whenever a representation is made to a statutory authority to redress the claim of the employee, there is a duty cast upon the authorities to consider the same on its own merits and pass appropriate orders in one way or other, instead of keeping the same pending indefinitely. Any inaction would amount to dereliction of duties.” TNN

Arjun Das, the erstwhile mahant of Hathiramji mutt who was sacked by the state government as its custodian, attempted to take charge on Friday, but was allegedly prevented by endowments officials. Das was suspended on January 29 over charges of irregularities in land dealings and unceremoniously shunted out, following which Srikalahasti temple executive officer C. Chandrasekhar Reddy took charge as the custodian.

On Friday, Das attempted to take charge following the directions of the high court, wherein Justice AV Sesha Sai, in his verdict dated Feb 10, granted an interim order against the suspension proceedings against him. Das claimed the action was politically motivated as leaders of various political parties had encroached upon the mutt’s lands. He further said that Lord’s jewels were in the safe custody of the court.

Amaravati: AP legislature secretary Balakrishnamacharyulu has once again made it clear that it is not possible to constitute the select committees as per the directives of the legislative council chairman.

With chairman MA Shariff setting a 48-hour deadline to constitute the committees, Balakrishnamacharyulu returned the file without issuing the notification on Friday. This is second time the secretary has returned the file to the chairman. Expressing serious displeasure over the secretary’s refusal to issue orders, Sharrif had asked him to fall in line before Friday evening.

However, the secretary has not followed the chairman’s directive citing rules. He clarified that there was no provision to issue notifications under rule 154 of business rules of the legislature to constitute the select committees.

Sources said the TDP is now planning to approach the high court seeking intervention in the matter.

Municipal administration minister Botcha Satyanarayana said the secretary has only cited the rules and it should not be construed as going against the chairman. “The secretary has to follow the rules and he has explained it to the chairman. Such decisions should not attract a privilege motion. The chairman is aware of the fact that he committed a grave mistake by referring the bills to the select committee without following due procedure,” said Ummareddi Venkateswarlu, the chief whip in the council.

Vijayawada: With an inter-state gang on the prowl across the highway region of Vijayawada and Krishna district, and the recent string of incidents including the Bhavanipuram murder for gain case, instances of robbery have increased in the region. Officials explained that none of the offenders involved in these incidents belonged to the state and were coming in from Bihar and Odisha.

While the city has witnessed robbery cases that have predominantly been restricted to chain-snatching and blade attacks, a new trend has emerged where inter-state gangs are targeting residential areas on the outskirts of Vijayawada and other parts of Krishna district.

The most recent incident was on February 11, when six miscreants robbed a family, stealing gold and cash to the tune of Rs 10 lakh in in Katur village of Vuyyur Mandal. Initially, it was suspected to be an Odia gang and later confirmed as a Bihari gang. Aarepalli Rajanikanth (50)—a farmer and resident of Katur village—and his wife were tied up after which their movable properties were stolen.

On February 7, two miscreants broke into a house and robbed a Marwari couple at knifepoint in Tiruvuru town. The complainant—identified Shohan Devi (30)—and her husband Gopal Singh were robbed of Rs 57,000 cash. In both these cases, cops are yet to nab the miscreants involved.

The biggest robbery instance that took place recently happened to be the Bhavanipuram murder case. The daylight murder of Yedupati Padmavathi (52) caused panic amongst locals in the city where the accused Gavirineni Anil Kumar, a resident of Chodavaram in Penamaluru mandal committed the offence. Interestingly, Anil was inspired by a crime show on television. Cops were swift enough to nab the accused.

However, the trend of house robbery in the district is still a cause for concern for locals.

Panaji: With discussions heating up over the excise duty hike on feni , former deputy chief minister Vijai Sardesai has joined those questioning the decision.

Waste management minister Michael Lobo had tweeted saying that he would speak to chief minister Pramod Sawant, asking him to consider reducing tax on wines served at weddings and traditional functions and also on the famous local brew, cashew feni.

Replying to the tweet, Sardesai asked Lobo whether Sawant’s decision was based on suggestions received from the pre-budget inputs he had sought from the public. “Whose idea was it to tax the heritage drink, which has GI? Did it come as a suggestion from the pre-budget online suggestions the government sought? Or was it an original idea by the head of the government?” Sardesai tweeted.

Meanwhile, the All Goa Distillers and Bottlers’ Association has sought a reduction in the excise duty on feni announced by the chief minister in his budget speech last week.

On Thursday, the association’s president, Gurudatta Bhakta, led a delegation to commissioner of commercial taxes, Amit Satija, to present their case. They will also be meeting the chief minister.

The tax, which ranges between Rs 10 per bulk litre and Rs 75 per bulk litre, has been imposed for the first time on bottled feni, the association said.

Since feni has been labelled a heritage drink, Bhakta said that “such a high levy” will not help in promoting it, but only make brand compliance difficult. Stating that they are not opposed to feni being taxed, Bhakta said it ought to be levied at a lower rate.

Feni was granted geographical indication (GI) certification over a decade ago, but only in the last three to four years efforts have been made to derive benefits out of this tag.

AURANGABAD: Four men have been convicted of killing real-estate agent Shaikh Jabbar in May 2018 and sentenced to life imprisonment by district judge-I SM Bhosale on Friday.

The four — Shaikh Wajed alias Babla, Shaikh Amjad alias Mohsin, Syed Shahabuddin alias Shahab and Shaikh Kalim alias Kallu — have been convicted on two different counts of kidnapping, murder and disappearance of evidence. The sentences for murder, kidnapping as well as disappearance of evidence would run concurrently for all convicts, except Wajed.

Considering the brutality with which the 30-year-old realtor was murdered, the prosecution sought capital punishment for Wajed who was accused of cutting open the deceased’s stomach and stashing stones in it before throwing the body in a well near the historic Mombatta Lake situated on the city outskirts.

Additional district government pleader Santosh Mundwadkar told TOI, “Of the 10 accused, four have been convicted and slapped with life imprisonment, one turned approver, three were acquitted and two accused — Shaikh Sikander and Shaikh Harun — are absconding since the incident took place.”

Reading out the judgement in open court, the district judge has pronounced that Wajed, on completion of his life sentence, shall separately suffer 10 years of rigorous imprisonment.

A total of 23 witnesses were examined during the course of trial that went on for a period of over one year. As per police record, Jabbar, a resident of Asifiya Colony, went missing on the afternoon of May 16 of 2018 following which a missing case was registered with Begumpura police station.

Couple of days later, the family lodged a kidnapping complaint suspecting the role of a person with whom Jabbar was having some land dispute.

At the same time an unidentified body was found floating in the well neighbouring historic Mobatta Lake by a water supply department employee. After verification it turned out to be Jabbar’s body.

The police then lodged a murder case and a team led by the then assistant inspector Rahul Rode managed to arrest Wajed in June, 2018, and detected the case.

The probe revealed that the convicts had tortured the man before killing him and dumping his body into the well.

Actor Naseeruddin Shah speaks at Bilal Bagh on Friday

BENGALURU: Actor Naseeruddin Shah late Friday evening made a surprise appearance at Bilal Bagh , Bengaluru’s Shaheen Bagh where women are on indefinite dharna against Citizenship (Amendment) Act 2019. He said women protesting in similar spaces across the country have given him the courage to speak up about all that’s wrong with the country.

Thousands of women thronged the shamiyana at the protest venue to catch a glimpse of Shah, who arrived around 9pm. They applauded his remarks attacking critics of the anti-CAA protest.

“These brave women are being asked by some that how can they come out on the streets. Have the men sent them to protest? Who gave them permission? And to them, I have only one thing to say: These brave women are awakened now and don’t need anyone’s approval,” Shah said to the roaring applause from the all-woman gathering.

“When students in Jamia Millia Islamia are attacked, when a nine-year-old girl in Bidar is traumatised and is forced to live alone because her mother is taken into custody on no grounds and when in Delhi’s Gargi College, miscreants enter the premises and misbehave with our daughters, people who have spoken about ‘beti-padao beti-bachao’ seem to have still not found a voice to speak out,” Shah said, adding the incidents left his blood boiling.

“But women like you in Shaheen Bagh and Bilal Bagh help me find courage and peace of mind,” he said. Shah stayed at the venue for around 15 minutes and organisers had a tough time escorting him out due to the huge crowd.

Earlier in the day, independent Gujarat MLA Jignesh Mevani assured the protesters that he would take their message of peace and resistance to Delhi’s Shaheen Bagh and everywhere else where similar protests are under way.

“...I bring you the message of the sisters protesting at Delhi’s Shaheen Bagh and Patna’s Sabzi Bagh that ‘we all are determined, you too remain firm in your resistance and we promise victory will be ours’,” Mevani told the women whose protest entered the seventh day on Friday.

Mevani said whenever someone asks him why protests like Shaheen Bagh are cropping up everywhere in the country and why do so many people go there, he answers: “Whoever has a conscience will go to Shaheen Bagh, Bilal Bagh and the likes. Those who place their belief in Manusmriti will build detention centres and those who place it in the Constitution will come to Shaheen Bagh.”

“I know you are full of enthusiasm but do remember to keep the slogans of Jai Shri Ram’ and ‘Nare Taqbeer’ in your hearts and homes. Because this is not a Hindu vs Muslim or India vs Pakistan fight. It’s BJP vs the entire India,” he said.

MUMBAI: A magistrate court recently held that original election cards are proof of citizenship while acquitting a Mankhurd couple arrested in 2017 on suspicion of being Bangladeshi nationals illegally living in India.

The court held a birth certificate, a domicile certificate, a bona fide certificate and a passport can be relied upon to establish the origin of any person.

“Even the election card can be said to be sufficient proof of citizenship, as while applying for an election card or a voting card, a person has to file a declaration with the authority in view of Form 6 of Peoples Representation Act that he is a citizen of India and if the declaration is found false, he is liable for punishment,” the court said.

The court further said the documents submitted by the accused, Abbas Shaikh (45) and Rabiya Shaikh (40), were not rebutted by the prosecution or proven to be fake.

“It is necessary to mention that the person may lie but the documents will never. Hence, I hold that the prosecution has failed to bring any evidence on record to establish that the documents produced by the accused are not genuine,” the court said.

The court clarified that the Aadhar card, PAN card, driving licence or ration card cannot be termed as documents proving citizenship as they are not meant for the purpose.

A third accused, Rabbiul Mizi (32), is absconding and the trial against him will be heard separately.

Vimala Sudheekshan and Gangadhar Tilak inspect a pothole being plugged

Vijayawada: In a bid to prevent any untoward incidents, Sudheekshan Foundation, a city-based NGO , along with Samadhanam, have begun patching up potholes at different areas in Vijayawada.

Vimala Sudheekshan, the founder of the NGO, citing official data, said that Andhra Pradesh stands sixth place in the country for most number of deaths due to potholes. “Around 15,000 people are dying annually, across the country, due to potholes, most of whom are bikers. We want to do whatever little we can to fix potholes to reduce the number,” Sudheekshan said.

Samadhanam, an Hyderabad-based NGO founded by Katakam Gangadhar Tilak, an ex-Vijayawada railway official who is known as a ‘roads doctor’.

With the help of road bond ready mix, staff members have patched a number of potholes across the city and the surrounding areas. Activists pointed that many of these potholes are formed again and again due to rains and apathy from civic and panchayat bodies.

Vijayawada too has seen a fair share of pothole deaths particularly on Eluru Road.

Activists say that areas like the Gollapudi-Sitara junction stretch, Mahanadu road, Autonagar, Kanuru and other arterial roads in One Town area are peppered with potholes of varying sizes, which is a death trap for drivers. Though temporary patch works are being taken up, the same region continues to get damaged as no permanent measures are taken.

Apart from the National Highways, a number of pothole-laden roads come under the roads and buildings department while the arterial and other roads are under the Vijayawada Municipal Corporation (VMC) limits.

248,['15/02/2020'],"Bihar: Four opposition leaders hold ‘secret’ meet without Congress, RJD","This story is from February 15, 2020

RLSP chief Upendra Kushwaha

PATNA: As the political focus shifts to Bihar after the Delhi election, churning within the opposition Mahagathbandhan (MGB) has begun with leaders of four constituents — RLSP chief Upendra Kushwaha , HAM (S) chief Jitan Ram Manjhi , VIP chief Mukesh Sahni and RLD patron Sharad Yadav — holding a closed-door meeting here on Friday.

Sources said the meeting — held in Yadav’s room at a posh hotel in Patna — was prompted by “concerns” of the smaller parties over RJD assuming “big brother” role in the alliance by announcing Tejashwi Prasad Yadav as the CM face. Congress and RJD representatives were not invited for the meeting hurriedly called a day before the RLD patron’s meeting with jailed RJD chief Lalu Prasad in Ranchi.

However, Sharad’s close aide and the RLD state vice-president, Binny Yadav, said, the three leaders came to request his party chief “to take more responsibility” in the alliance. Binny added, “They want him to head the co-ordination committee of the Mahagatbandhan, which will soon be formed. He will convey everyone’s demand to Lalu Ji.”

The RLSP functionary said, “He (Sharad) is also from Yadav caste and far more experienced and mature than Tejashwi. I believe he will more responsibly handle the alliance affairs than Tejashwi.”

RJD and Congress both tried to downplay the meeting. While RJD asserted that Tejashwi will be the CM face, Congress leaders said there is no harm in holding a meeting.

After the meeting, Manjhi said, he met Sharad to discuss the “lethargic role of RJD and Congress over CAA, NRC and NPR apart from other issues” related to Mahagatbandhan.

“Alliance co-ordination committee will decide on CM's face,” he said, adding, “We are in touch with a few more people and things will be clear on February 18, or after that.” Interestingly, expelled JD (U) leader Prashant Kishor had also given the same deadline for pronouncing his next political move.

Sahni said, “There is nothing wrong in meeting Sharad Yadav ji because he is a senior leader and our patron. He is also close to Lalu ji and will be meeting him on Saturday to apprise him about our discussions.” However, Sahni gave a conflicting indication saying, “Sharad could not be given the charge of co-ordination committee as only a leader who stayed 24X7 in Bihar could handle the affairs.”

Sahni appeared softer on the issue of Tejashwi as CM candidate. “The party which wins more seats will naturally get the CM’s post and no doubt RJD is a big party and Tejashwi is the leader of opposition. Also Lalu Ji’s blessing is a must for CM’s post.”

Sahni also hinted at possible discussions between Mahagatbandhan leaders and Kishor and, like Manjhi, said, wait for February 18.

However, RJD said such meetings will have no consequences. “Since Sharad Yadav Ji is a senior leader, there is nothing wrong in meeting him. But Mahagatbandhan’s meet is not possible without RJD and Tejashwi Ji. If anyone has any confusion, I would like to clear that Tejashwi is the only CM candidate and those who accompany him in the chariot will win this battle. For others it will not be possible to even reach the battleground,” said RJD state spokesperson Mritunjay Tiwari.

249,['15/02/2020'],Medical seat-blocking scandal leaves Karnataka Examinations Authority richer by Rs 40 crore,"Representative image

Times View The seat-blocking scam is a disgraceful operation that takes away seats allocated for genuinely meritorious students and gives them to the affluent. In this context, raising the penalty for those who surrender their seats makes a lot of sense. It would be appropriate to penalise colleges where such malpractice is widespread. The seats that are transferred from open to management quota are sold for exorbitant sums. So why not let a bigger portion of this money go to the education department? The government could also tax seats that private colleges sell.

Rs 10 crore from other courses

BENGALURU: It’s not only private medical colleges that are laughing all the way to the bank, thanks to the seat-blocking scandal. Karnataka Examinations Authority ( KEA ) too has made a whopping Rs 40 crore in five academic years (2015-2020) by forfeiting fees paid by candidates who block undergraduate seats but surrender them later.In the seat-blocking scandal, meritorious candidates are suspected to land top ranks in National Eligibility cum Entrance Test (NEET), block seats in private medical colleges by paying the fee to KEA and surrender them after the final mop-up round of counselling. The surrendered seats are added to the management quota of private medical colleges, which sell them in return for huge sums of money.KEA’s gain, however, is unintended. It collects fee from selected candidates and has to transfer it to the colleges concerned later. However, with the candidates backing out even before the fee is transferred and failing to provide a convincing explanation for abandoning the seats, the fee is confiscated by KEA as penalty . During 2019-20, KEA saw 276 candidates surrendering MBBS seats in various private medical colleges. Consequently, they became management seats.Candidates surrendering seats also have to pay Rs 10,000 as penalty to the directorate of medical education. This is apart from the first-year college fee that is forfeited by KEA in case candidates to provide a convincing explanation.Rajiv Gandhi University of Health Sciences has submitted a report to the department of medical education on reforms that need to be brought in to end the scam. RGUHS suggested the penalty must be over Rs 25 lakh for MBBS seats surrendered after the mop-up round.Dr PG Girish, director of medical education, said changes will be made to stop candidates from surrendering seats after the final round. “The need is to increase penalty in such a way that the candidate doesn’t leave the seat. That’s being done. The system will be taken online and students’ biometric details will be checked during every round of counselling,” said Dr Girish.KEA authorities said the scandal can be checked only when a candidate surrendering the seat after the mop-up round is made to face criminal charges and undergo a thorough investigation. “The other suggestion made to the government is that the college should collect the entire course fee from the candidate and not allot the seat to anyone else,” said an officer.There’s a possibility of candidates seeking seats in institutions outside Karnataka surrendering their seats here. “Though NEET is the only exam for MBBS entrance, counselling doesn’t happen in all states at once. There could be genuine candidates who want to join medical colleges elsewhere and give away their seat here. That can be tackled only through centralised counselling,” said an expert.Candidates surrendering UG seats in dental, engineering, pharmacy and farm sciences also end up benefiting KEA by not providing convincing explanations. In five academic years, it has gained Rs 10 crore in the form of fees paid by such candidates. This is in addition to around Rs 40 crore the authority has got from candidates giving up MBBS seats. KEA officials, however, said surrendering of seats in dental, engineering, pharmacy and farm sciences is not part of any seat-blocking scam .",bengaluru,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74145183,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-430987,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/seat-blocking-scam-leaves-kea-richer-by-rs-40-crore/articleshow/74142033.cms

251,['15/02/2020'],Palghar cops nab spurned suitor who wanted to torch woman’s kin,"This story is from February 15, 2020

Accused was nabbed at Palghar station late on Thursday night

MUMBAI: Palghar police succeeded in averting a repeat of the recent Hinganghat incident where a teacher was torched by a stalker, by arresting a 28-year-old Rajasthan man with plans to set afire the mother and sister of a 24-year-old woman who had called off their wedding last year. She later married someone else.

Bhaironsinh Rathod was nabbed from Palghar railway station late on Thursday with a bottle containing 750ml of petrol. He wanted to target the woman’s mother and sister as he did not have her contact details.

Rathod was to marry the woman last year but her mother called it off after learning that he had lied about his job; he was unemployed and was an alcoholic. Even after the wedding was called off, Rathod continued to harass the woman over phone and on social media.

As his threats to deter her from marrying failed, he began to harass her mother and sister. Palghar police inspector Dashrath Patil said the mother approached them early this month when Rathod threatened to set them and their home on fire.

She shared with the police threat messages sent by Rathod to the family. He went a step further and began to defame the now married woman on Facebook.

A Palghar police team went to Ajmer to nab Rathod but did not find him there. On Thursday, Rathod called the woman’s mother and threatened to set her afire. She informed the police who on tracking his cellphone found he had landed at Palghar railway station. Rathod was nabbed late at night. He told the police he procured the petrol from an autorickshaw driver in Ajmer.

He was booked under sections of IPC and IT Act.

252,['15/02/2020'],50% of Bihar households exposed to migration: Study,"This story is from February 15, 2020

Representative image

PATNA: If a recent study conducted by Institute of Population Sciences (IIPS) is to be believed, more than half of the households in Bihar are exposed to migration to more developed places within or outside the country and majority of households depend on remittances for their livelihood.

The report of the IIPS-sponsored study project, ‘Causes and consequences of out migration from middle Ganga plain’, was jointly released by IIPS director K S James and state education minister Krishnandan Prasad Verma here on Thursday.

The survey, which covered 36 villages and 2,270 households, reveals that migration from the region is male selective without family. Highest migration occurs in the traditional migration pockets of Saran, Munger, Darbhanga, Kosi, Tirhut and Purnia. Seasonal migration is highest in Kosi, Tirhut and Purnia divisions. The migration is highest from other caste groups followed by OBCs, SCs and STs.

Middle Ganga plain covers 64 districts of eastern Uttar Pradesh and Bihar. Historically, migration from this region dates back to the first quarter of the 19th century. Due to persistent widespread poverty and under development, migration from this region continued even after Independence and mainly remained confined to the developed western states of the country. Recently, this region also showed a significant rise in trend of international migration towards the Gulf destinations. The continuum of two-century-old association between migration and poverty has led to the “culture of migration” in Middle Ganga Plain, the study says.

It has been observed that migration is highest for the landless group and nuclear families in Bihar. The average age of migrants is 32 years. Eighty per cent migrants are landless or have less than one acre of land and 85% of them have passed Class X. Ninety per cent of the migrants work in private factory or as casual workers. Average remittance by a migrant is Rs 26,020 in Bihar and Rs 38,061 in eastern Uttar Pradesh per annum.

As far as the status of women in migrants’ local households is concerned, 47% women are literate and 22% of them work for wages. Majority of the left behind women in Bihar lives in nuclear family. Three-fourth of the left behind women communicate with their husband daily on mobile. Only 29% women are members of self-help groups and 80% women have their own bank accounts.

Wives of both migrants as well as non-migrants feel that economic status, lifestyle, autonomy, education and health of children improve after the migration of their husbands.

Seasonal migration is more predominant in Bihar, as 90% of the seasonal migrants are from Bihar. While 31% from Bihar migrated to Punjab, 27% from UP migrated to Maharshtra. Nearly 46% of seasonal migrants bring cash at the end of the month and 48% operate through banking system, the study reveals.

The study further reveals that 75% migrants perceived improvement in their family income, family bonding and social status after their return. As many as 25% of them want to migrate again while two-thirds would encourage their children to migrate for employment, the study concludes.

Project coordinators K C Das and R B Bhagat, both from IIPS, observed that the most important outcome of migration is remittance which influences the process of development and brings change in the consumption pattern and lifestyle of the individual.

“Remittances result in increase in wealth of the family and consequential improvement in education and nutrition of the members of the household and greater use of hospital facilities during times of illness of the family members,” they said.

NEW DELHI: The passengers flying out of Delhi now have the option of getting their luggage transported from their place of stay to the airport for check-in. The paid facility is also available to the flyers arriving at the city’s Indira Gandhi International Airport (IGIA).

The service, which covers the whole of Delhi and the neighbouring states of Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan, was launched at Terminal 3 on Friday by Delhi International Airport Ltd (DIAL), the IGIA operator, which is collaborating with a Bengaluru-based firm, CarterX.

The charges will vary according to the number, size and the weight of the luggage and the distance of the pick-up/drop point, DIAL said. The charges start from Rs 299 and there is no separate delivery fee for Delhi, said a CarterX spokesperson. “The locations in the neighbouring states are considered outstation and charges are applicable pincode-wise,” he added.

The facility is now available only at T3 for both international and domestic flights. “A passenger flying out of Delhi can book their baggage through the CarterX website or through its mobile application,” said a DIAL spokesperson. The booking will soon be available on the IGIA website, www.newdelhiairport.in.

CarterX doesn’t charge anything for a luggage weighing up to 20kg, said its spokesperson. For every extra 5kg, an additional Rs 100 will be charged. “The maximum weight of a bag can be 40kg and the charges will also vary according to its dimension. We accept dimensions as per the airlines’ guidelines. Additional charges are decided after an inspection,” he added.

For the out-bound flyers, the luggage will be delivered to them on their chosen time slot at the airport so that they can proceed for check-in, the spokesperson said. The passengers arriving in Delhi can book their luggage from their outstation locations and the bags will be collected after they reach IGIA. “The bags will then be delivered to the address provided by them,” he added.

DIAL said each luggage, once booked, would be secured in tamper-resistant sealed bags and marked and barcoded for easy identification. They will be insured by the service-providing company.

AMARAVATI: The income tax raids on infrastructure companies owned by close aides of TDP leaders N Chandrababu Naidu and Nara Lokesh has generated political heat in the state, with the YSRC launching a full-throttle campaign to push opposition TDP into a corner.YSRC parliamentary party leader V Vijayasai Reddy said the I-T raids have uncovered just one layer of the million-fold corrupt deeds of Naidu. “Several more layers are yet to be uncovered. The raids have unmasked Naidu’s real face, who round-tripped thousands of crores from infrastructure companies. We strongly believe irregularities worth more than Rs 10 lakh crore would be uncovered if the investigation goes further deep into the illegal network,” he said.Chief minister YS Jaganmohan Reddy’s advisor Sajjala Ramakrishna Reddy said the I-T raids on Naidu’s former personal secretary Pendyala Srinivas are only the tip of the iceberg. “Many big names are involved in the racket and more skeletons would tumble soon,” he alleged.Agriculture minister Kurasala Kannababu demanded an inquiry into Naidu’s assets by the Enforcement Directorate. “People have now come to know how Naidu plundered government treasury. The raids prove that TDP leadership was the fountainhead of corruption. Bogus contractors and benamis were got a free run during the TDP regime,” he said. Minister Avanti Srinivas said Naidu’s role in the multi-crore scam is evident from the I-T raids and a CBI inquiry should be conducted into it.Meanwhile, TDP has strongly refuted the charges linking Naidu with the I-T raids, saying it’s an attempt to malign the former chief minister’s clean image. “Srinivas was relieved from Naidu’s office nine months ago. While the I-T officials claim to have unearthed Rs 2,000 crore worth irregularities, the YSRC is spreading a false campaign as if the amount was found with Srinivas,” fumed former minister Yanamala Ramakrishnudu.TDP MLC Ashok Babu said Naidu’s family members have revealed their assets every year. “Why has Jagan’s family failed to do the same? YSRC leaders should first question their leader’s integrity,” he said.Deputy leader in the assembly Atchhannaidu said Jagan’s father YS Rajasekhara Reddy had failed to prove a single charge against Naidu even after instituting 26 inquiries. “Jagan should first come clean and complete the pending inquiry into the cases filed against him. TDP is in no way connected with the I-T raids and its revelations,” said Atchannaidu.TDP national general secretary Nara Lokesh said Jagan has started a “false campaign” against their family as he is worried about going to jail.",vijayawada,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74143987,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-298949,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/income-tax-raids-on-naidus-ex-aide-trigger-political-slugfest-between-ysr-cong-tdp/articleshow/74142259.cms

Panaji: MGP on Friday demanded that the state government postpone the zilla panchayat elections scheduled on March 22 due to the upcoming school and college examinations that will commence by February end and conclude on April 20. MGP wants the elections to be held after April 20.

Senior MGP functionary Ramkrishna Dhavalikar told reporters that the state government should see what is important before postponing the election. Recently, the ZP elections were postponed due to carnival and shigmo celebrations.

Stating that till date the government had not notified reservation of constituencies for ZP elections, Dhavalikar said, “The government is trying to mess with the ZP elections. I want to ask the government, ‘who will announce reservation of constituencies — government or state election commission?”

He said the reservation of constituencies should be announced by February 16. “If not, we will not be able to ask our candidates to start work for elections,” Dhavalikar added.

Speaking on the Mhadei issue, the senior MGP member said that he did not trust any national party with the issue, including Congress, which he said was “doing drama over the matter”.

He referred to the speech made by Congress Rajya Sabha MP, B K Hariprasad, in which he had demanded that the Centre give environmental clearance for the water project on the river. “It looks like both Congress and BJP are together on the Mhadei issue,” Dhavalikar said.

MGP has decided to organise a candlelight morcha in Panaji in March to highlight the Mhadei issue.

On the law and order situation in the state with relation to the 38 people who were booked on Thursday for rioting in a Baga hotel, he said that it was an example of deteriorating law and order situation in the state.

On the disqualification petition, Dhavalikar said that tourism minister Manohar Ajgaonkar and PWD minister Deepak Pauskar filed their reply in the case, copies of which have been handed over to them. He also said that the case has been adjourned till March 6.

Aurangabad: A 10-ft high statue of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj made of metal will be placed at the Kranti Chowk ahead of Shiv Jayanti on February 19, said mayor Nandkumar Ghode

Municipal commissioner Astik Kumar Pandey, civic officials, the mayor, deputy mayor Rajendra Janjal, house leader Vikas Jain and others visited Kranti Chowk and discussed the alternative arrangements with the engineers and architects.

Following the visit, Nandkumar Ghodele said, “The Aurangabad Municipal Corporation is responsible to make arrangement for the celebration of Shiv Jayanti. The enthroned statue of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj depicting the coronation scene will be placed for people to pay their tribute. The statue will be kept at Kranti Chowk for the entire day and thereafter will be removed,” Ghodele said.

Ghodele said that the order for the statue has been given to a contractor. The AMC is yet to receive an estimate for the statue procurement.

The civic body had removed the statue of the Maratha warrior from Kranti Chowk in July to increase the height of the structure.

Currently, the AMC has dug up the Kranti Chowk circle around 20 feet deep and the civil works are going on for raising the pedestal on which the new statue will be placed. However, the AMC has not been able to issue the tender for the procurement of the new statue yet.

In failure to meet the deadline, the pressure is building upon the civic body by the representatives of the Maratha community.

In the ‘skull breaker’ challenge, three people stand side by side

NEW DELHI: A new challenge going viral on social media, called “tripping jump” or “skull breaker”, has become a cause of concern for parents. Doctors said it has the potential to fracture every joint in the body of the person accepting the challenge. After “blue whale” and “momo” challenges, this is the third scare in the line because of which children have landed in a vulnerable position.

Principals of many schools said that though they haven’t seen children performing the challenge, awareness needs to be built against it. Earlier, when cases of children indulging in such challenges were reported, advisories were issued by both schools and the government.

Various countries have termed “skull breaker” as the latest danger in school. In some countries, police have started investigations to find out how it started. In this challenge, three people stand side by side. The person in the middle jumps high, while those on the side kick at the jumper’s legs. Because of this, the jumper lands on the ground with a hard bang. In the videos being circulated, it seems that the person in the middle is unaware of what is going to occur. There are also versions in which the jumper knows what’s happening and tries to avoids tripping. TikTok has its own version called the “skull breaker challenge”.

A mother, who got a video as a WhatsApp forward, said, “It is very scary. Imagine falling when you are jumping. These days, children have easy access to social media platforms, so how do we stop them? Some may also use this challenge to bully. This is scarier than the challenges that went viral earlier.”

Doctors said that this prank should not be performed because it may fracture every joint. Dr Rajeev Sharma, chairman, orthopaedics at Vimhans, said, “The person who trips has a free fall on the hip. He or she can fracture the knee, ankle, hip or any other joint. There is also a risk of ligament tear.”

HYDERABAD: A special operations team of Shamshabad zone arrested two persons for sending women from India to Kuwait via Dubai for employment using fake police clearance, medical and stamping certificates.

The accused were identified as Rellu Kubender Rao, 32, from Rajendranagar and Shaik Basheer Ahmed, 60, from Kumbakonam, Tamil Nadu. A third associate, Balu Prasad from Chennai, is at large. The two accused were caught at a hotel at Shamshabad and Rs 2 lakh cash, 16 passports and 13 visa papers were recovered from them.

The Cyberabad police said: “For any worker to go to Kuwait, they would require the Immigration Clearance Certificate for ECR passports. To bypass the system, the accused would send the workers to Dubai on a tourist visa. From there, they would go to Kuwait, thus escaping from immigration clearance.”

Kubender Rao studied the process of sending people to the Gulf for employment. He created fake documents, and got stamps from Balu Prasad. Kuwaiti stickers were used for making the fake stamps,arranged by Basheer Ahmed.

Hyderabad: A 60-year-old woman and her 32-year-old daughter were stabbed to death by a relative over monetary dispute on Friday at their house in Chandrayangutta. Shehzadi Begum and her daughter, Fareeda, were killed by Fareeda’s brother in-law, Rehman, and his friend, Multani, both butchers from Chandrayangutta.

Rehman has been working in West Asian countries since 2012 and he used to send the earnings into Fareeda’s bank account. Rehman’s brother works in Dubai. Recently, Rehman came to Hyderabad on personal visit and asked Fareeda for Rs 32 lakh he had deposited over the years.

“But Fareeda refused to return the amount. She only returned a small amount and did not even heed to her husband’s advice to return the money,” said an officer from Falaknuma police.

On Friday, Rehman and Multani went to Fareeda’s mother’s house and began arguing about the money. “Only Fareeda and her mother were at home. During the argument, the accused slit the throats of the women, killing them on the spot,” said Falaknuma ACP Mohammed Majeed.

The accused fled from the spot and neighbours alerted cops about the murder. Police rushed to the scene with a dog squad and forensic team. After securing evidence from the scene, the bodies were shifted to Osmania General Hospital for post-mortem and a murder case was registered.

On Friday night, police picked up both the accused from a hideout in Chabndrayangutta. While questioning, Rehman claimed that Fareeda had bought a house with the money he had sent and so, refused to return it despite repeated requests.

Amaravati: Making a strong pitch for abolition of the legislative council, chief minister YS Jaganmohan Reddy on Friday requested Union home minister Amit Shah to extend the Centre’s support to clear the hurdles in the abolition process.

The chief minister urged him to intervene to route the council abolition bill to the Parliament and get its nod in the current session itself. This is chief minister’s second visit to the national capital in the last three days after his meeting with Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Wednesday.

Jagan is believed to have briefed the home minister about the issues he presented to the Prime Minister two days ago. He also explained that the PM had positively responded to his requests and that he needed the support of the home minister to get the promises cleared.

The CM is believed to have discussed the issue of three capital cities with Shah and sought Shah’s support in issuing a notification from the Centre to move the HC to Kurnool.

Shah was also urged to positively consider the issue of release of funds for the Polavaram project. Jagan said the state would require financial support from the Centre to take up the relief and rehabilitation works of Polavaram project as it requires nearly Rs 34,000 crore.

The chief minister also requested the home minister to grant funds for modernisation of state police’s infrastructure, in particular to spare funds for construction of AP police academy which was part of the Reorganisation Act. Stating that the state government was not in a position to take additional financial burden, Jagan requested Shah to be liberal with funds for the state. He also reminded him the Centre’s assurance to grant special category status ( SCS ) to the state and the recent recommendation of the 15th finance commission which left the issue at the discretion of the Centre.

The CM is likely to meet Union law minister Ravi Shankar Prasad, finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman and commerce minister Piyush Goyal on Saturday.

Aurangabad: The Communist Party of India (Marxist) has decided to hold door-to-door campaign across the country from March 1 in order to educate people about Citizenship Amendment Act, 2019, National Register of Citizens (NRC) and National Population Register (NPR).

CPM leader Brinda Karat, during a press conference held in the city on Friday, said the party will appeal to people to refuse to answer questions asked by the government.

Hitting out at the central government, Karat said during the recent Delhi assembly elections for the first time country’s home minister turned into country’s hate minister.

“The CAA-NRC- NPR is a straight attack on the Constitution of India. In the first phase of its implementation, government will send people to each of the houses and ask questions for the NPR. We are going say that we are not going to answer the questions,” Karat said.

Terming it as a three-edged trishul, the senior politician said CAA-NRC-NPR is piercing the soul of India. “The Maharashtra government should clarify its stand on the CAA-NRC-NPR. The CPM government in Kerala has passed a resolution, refusing to implement NPR in the state,” she said.

“There is absolutely no need for such a process in the country. If you need a register there are other documents for that. We don’t require NRC or NPR to decide who the citizen of this country is,” she added. Karat also criticized the Modi government for rise in price of LPG cylinder, unemployment, privatisation of public assets, slashing down fund allocation for MNERGA, food security, scheduled caste-scheduled tribes and midday meals.

“The CAA-NRC-NPR is not just a cover-up by the central government for its failure in dealing with key issues, but is an agenda being pushed by it with the help of the brute majority in the parliament.”

HUBBALLI: Invest Karnataka Hubballi Conference kicked off here on Friday with Union chemicals and fertiliser minister DV Sadananda Gowda announcing the setting up of a Central Institute of Plastics Engineering and Technology unit here.

Inaugurating the event, chief minister BS Yediyurappa said Karnataka can play A key role in developing $5 trillion economy, the Prime Minister’s vision, by 2024. “Industrialise or Perish were Sir M Visvesvaraya’s words and that’s the economic philosophy of our government. Karnataka is well known for IT and software exports. It’s also a centre for aerospace, automobiles, machine tools, electric vehicles and biotech. It possesses the unbeatable combination of hi-tech technology and outstanding workforce. We’re in the process of setting up Global Manufacturing Clusters in North Karnataka — toys in Koppal; textiles in Ballari; FMCG in Hubballi; solar power goods in Kalaburagi and agricultural implements in Bidar,” he said.

Sadananda Gowda said his ministry is setting up a Drug Park at a cost of Rs 100 crore in Yadgir.

Union parliamentary affairs minister Pralhad Joshi said, “Karnataka ranks third in FDI destination in the country. Hubballi is a major industrial town in North Karnataka located strategically on Golden Quadrilateral NH-4 which is also the Mumbai-Bengaluru Industrial Corridor.”

Minister of state for railways Suresh Angadi said development of the eight-lane road from Pune to Bengaluru will promote intra- and inter-state business and promote business and commercial activities in Hubballi-Dharwad. “We’re working on ensuring rail connectivity to the last mile. For example, a train between Hubballi and Mangaluru will connect us to the coastal region, which, in turn, will boost economic activities. Projects like the Belagavi-Pune train from Hubballi and the new Belagavi-Kittur-Dharwad line have been proposed,” he added.

Large and medium scale industry minister Jagadish Shettar said the new industry policy 2019-24 will give preference for industrial development in tier-2 and tier-3 cities of the state. “When we went to Mumbai, Hyderabad, Guwahati and other cities to invite investors, many asked, ‘Where is Hubballi?’ Many industrialists want to set up units only in and around Bengaluru. We convinced them to come to tier-2 cities of North Karnataka like Hubballi-Dharwad, Belagavi, Kalaburagi, Bidar, and they’re thinking of coming here,” he said.

Ministers Basavaraj Bommai, CC Patil, MPs Prabhakar Kore, Shivakumar Udasi, Bhagavant Khooba and many elected representatives, industrialists from across the country and officials were present on the occasion.

Tirupati: Hyderabad metro rail managing director NVS Reddy has suggested commissioning of light metro transit system in Tirumala to ease traffic congestion on the twin ghat roads.

Reddy met TTD chairman Y V Subba Reddy at Padmavathi guest house in Tirupati on Friday and discussed various aspects related to traffic congestion in Tirumala and Tirupati, and the beautification works to be executed from Tirupati airport near Renigunta till the temple city among other things.

Whether the light metro rail proposal will take concrete shape is a million dollar question.

It may be recalled that the Tirupati urban development authority had plans in 2014 itself to commission a mono-rail system from the RTC bus station in Tirupati all the way up to Tirumala hills at a cost of Rs 9,000 crore. However, the project was later shelved.

Representative image

NEW DELHI: A study conducted by the US FDA found popular weight-loss medicine Lorcaserin , which has been in use in the country for nearly seven years and was launched in India recently, increases the risk of cancer. The drug regulatory authority has, therefore, ordered its withdrawal from the market with immediate effect.

“Patient should stop taking Lorcaserin and talk to healthcare professionals about alternative medicines and weight management programmes,” stated the US FDA in its latest advisory. Lorcaserin was approved by FDA in 2012 for use with reduced-calorie diet and increased physical activity to help weight loss in adults who are obese or overweight and have weight-related medical problems.

According to the drug regulatory authority of the US, Lorcaserin works by increasing feelings of fullness, which leads to less food intake. It is available in the form of tablets (Belviq) and an extended release tablet (Belviq XR).

Dr Sujeet Jha, principal director, endocrinology, Max Hospitals, said this was the third weight-loss medicine to be banned in the past 14 years. “We have at least 50 patients who are using it. I am going to ask them to stop taking it immediately,” he said.

Dr Anoop Misra, chairman, Fortis C-DOC centre of for diabetes, metabolic diseases and endocrinology, also said that they had been using this drug to reduce weight, but were not impressed by the results. “We need better and more effective drugs since many people find it hard to lose weight. With the ban, options are fewer in India,” he added.

Obesity affects nearly one in three adults in India. Doctors said weight-loss medicines were prescribed when reduction was not achieved through diet restrictions and increased physical activity. “It is prescribed for about 12 weeks and usually leads to reduction of 5-10% of weight,” said a doctor.

Concerns over the side-effects of weight-loss medicines have been raised in the past too. In 1997, a doctor said, the US FDA had recalled fenfluramine and dexfenfluramine because of problems related to heart valve.

Apart from the weight-loss drug, people also go for bariatric surgery. The Obesity Surgery Society of India claims India has seen a 100-fold increase in weight-loss surgeries — rising from just 200-odd in 2004 to over 20,000 in 2019. The surgery involves bypassing or stapling of a portion of the stomach to reduce a person’s appetite.

Railway stall exhibition receiving an overwhelming response

HUBBALLI: The railway stall exhibiting spare parts is receiving an overwhelming response.

Since morning, many members of small-scale industries and manufacturers of spare parts visited the railway stall and filled forms for the Rail Ancillary Components Manufacturing Park, which is proposed to come up at Kittur in Belagavi district. According to railway officials, over 70 manufacturers from Guwahati, Andhra Pradesh and Maharashtra filled in their application and submitted the same.

R K Varma, senior section engineer, Hubballi division, who is looking after the spare parts pertaining to railway line, said there is a huge scope for spare parts required for laying railway lines. “For the latest design of the railway line, there is huge demand for wider-base PSC line sleepers, which are currently being supplied from Hubballi and Hosapete,” he added.

There is also demand for composite grooved rubber sole plate and combination metal liners which are being imported. “As per new design of railway line, goods trains can run 100km per hour, and can also carry more quantity of goods compared to earlier,” he added.

In another stall, KLE Society demonstrated its Rs 600 crore project of establishing a full-fledged hospital having 1,200 beds and also a medical college in Hubballi. The hospital and college is expected to come up At Bidnal. Society officials said the hospital and college will start functioning by 2023, and the work has commenced.

KIADB, Tata Hitachi and other companies have also set up their stalls at the convention venue.

Suresh Angadi, minister of state for railways, visited Aequs, a toy manufacturing cluster, and discussed about the product range. Later, he visited the railways stall and enquired about spare parts exhibited there.

Hyderabad: International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics ( ICRISAT ), Hyderabad launched India’s first public research facility, RapidGen on Friday with an aim to reduce the time of crop cycles.

Experts said that the facility will shorten the time to breed new crop varieties, which are relatively high yielding and more suitable to adverse environmental conditions.

“Every crop is unique in the way it responds to a set of environmental parameters. We have to mimic the right set of conditions within closed spaces to convince a plant to grow faster at high density and to reproduce quickly,” said Pooja Bhatnagar-Mathur, team leader at ICRISAT.

“A facility like this can help accelerate the cycle from a period of six to seven years to the crop completeing its whole cycle in one to two years,” she added. The facility is comprised of three installations — an area where the different crops are tested, another where the tested crops are kept in lighting controlled space, and a temperature-regulated area called polyhouse.

“With facilities like RapidGen, crop breeders can overcome the limitations of seasons and develop the future generations of a crop in a fraction of the time and cost it would take if done in fields,” said Peter Carberry, director-general, ICRISAT.

Depending on the crop and the requirements of breeding programs, researchers can scale-up their activities in either of the installations, read an official release from ICRISAT. The polyhouse, which is the largest of the three installations can be used for over 30,000 crosses in one go.

“After testing crops and preparing a protocol, these modern techniques can be accommodated into breeding programs,” said Kiran K Sharma, deputy director general-research, ICRISAT.

Madurai: Food safety department officials from Madurai dispatched the first consignment of used cooking oil collected from 222 food business operators (FBOs) from the city under Repurpose Used Cooking Oil (RUCO) scheme . Madurai district collector T G Vinay flagged off the truck carrying 15,000 litre oil to a plant in Kakinada, where the oil would be converted into bio-diesel.

Officials said that Madurai is leading all other districts in the state when it comes to implementation of RUCO scheme. On average, 250 to 300 litres of used oil is being collected per day. An agency called Anantha Oil Corporation collects the oil and pays Rs 25 per litre to FBOs. So far Rs 3.89 lakh has been paid towards it. Around 460 containers have been issued to FBO for storing oil.

Designated officer for food safety, Madurai district, Dr M Somasundaram said there is a bigger scope for this scheme in Madurai. “We have covered only 222 FBOs, who use 40 litres of oil every day. There are 100 wards in Madurai city. Considering that there are at least minimum of 10 more FBOs using 40 litres a day, the oil collected will go up by manyfold,” he said.

More shops would be brought under the scheme in the coming months. He said that even smaller FBOs, whose production of used oil per day is less than one and two litre can be brought under the scheme. Ultimately, it will help consumers as the used oil will go out of the system. It also helps the environment since most of the used oil end up being dumped into water bodies if not collected, he added.

278,['15/02/2020'],NU fetes Srivastava for getting PhD at 78,"This story is from February 15, 2020

Nagpur: Shrichandra Srivastava, who created a history by doing PhD in chemistry at a ripe age of 78, was honoured with Vitthalrao Jibhkate award on Thursday, the first day of four-day international conference on ‘Advances in physical, chemical and mathematical sciences’ (ICAPCM).

The programme was hosted jointly by Nagpur University and Laxminarayan Institute of Technology at Dr Vasantrao Deshpande Hall.

The university felicitates the senior-most person with Jibhkate prize at the convocation ceremony every year. This time, the deadline to apply for the prize was January 4 for which 66-year-old Jyoti Wadhwa had already staked claim as the oldest recipient. The award was given to Wadhwa as the application of Srivastava was received on January 10.

Srivastava, who retired as senior chemist from Indian Bureau of Mines (IBM), did PhD in ‘Microwave-assisted synthesis and characterization of some ter-polymers using substituted phenols, carbamides and formaldehyde’ under the guidance of LJ Paliwal.

He was also associated with the postgraduate department of geology of Nagpur University.

An elated Srivastava told TOI that he wanted to do a doctorate quite early, but could not. He expressed gratitude for felicitating him with the prize.

Manik Salunkhe, vice-chancellor of Bharati Vidyapeeth, Pune, was the chief guest. SP Kane, vice-chancellor of Nagpur University presided while pro-VC Vinayak Deshpande was the guest of honour.

In his address, Salunkhe underlined the importance of gaining knowledge and keeping updated. “It is a fact that India is lagging behind as compared to the western countries mainly because of lack of proper industrial revolution. How to bring about a change in work culture is still a challenge,” he said.

Such events are helpful in providing better opportunities to gain knowledge as science is all about understanding nature and the world, he added.

In his presidential address, Kane spoke about the hard work put in by the university members to conduct the international conference. He said, “In just about a month’s time, the university prepared itself to host the event in which more than 1,000 delegates are participating. This is the first time the university has brought together different departments and subjects.”

In his speech, chairman of ICAPCM Govardhan Khadekar said the programme will provide an opportunity to connect better with university laboratories. The conference will conclude on Sunday.

Besides participants from all over the country, delegates from Malaysia, Philippines, South Korea and Sweden are also part of the conference.

Amruta Indurkar of the department of Marathi spoke about the background and academic excellence of Kane. In the scroll of honour, she highlighted the achievements of Kane and the progresses that the university made under his guidance.

Kane was felicitated with a shawl, shrifal and memento by Salunkhe.

VM Tangde, organizing member of ICAPCM, was felicitated by acting registrar Niraj Khaty for his untiring efforts to conduct the mega event.

The programme was conducted by Manisha Joshi and Priyanka Warnekar, professors at Priyadarshini College of Engineering. Tangde proposed a vote of thanks.

Pune: Nearly 150 town planning schemes in Maharashtra, proposed by the erstwhile BJP-led government, have failed to take off.

The then government had hoped to roll-out 150 town planning schemes in the state, but the current dispensation is yet to give the necessary clearances, officials in the know said. “The realty sector is not looking up and the cash-strapped state government is keen on focusing other schemes,” one official said.

The plan was further hobbled by the lack of interest showed by the civic bodies in the state. Senior town planning department officials said that while the previous government had directed 27 municipal corporations and 250 municipal councils to come up with proposals — on the lines of the Mann-Mhalunge scheme — only a handful have shown interest as the current government is yet to issue directions on the same. “Only Pune Municipal Corporation, Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation, Kalyan-Dombivli Municipal Corporation, Mumbai Metropolitan Regional Development Authority, Pune Metropolitan Regional Development Authority and Nagpur Municipal Corporation have responded,” a top government official said.

The official added the government would clear the proposals as and when the local authority submits one. However, some analysts said the process may not be as clear-cut. “The slowdown in the announcement of more schemes could also be attributed to the amount of time it consumes — from the announcement of the schemes to checking for the land ownership, it is a lengthy process,” another analyst said.

Pimpri Chinchwad: A seven-year-old female leopard was trapped in a cage at Kanhere village in Baramati taluka early on Thursday morning.

This was the second leopard trapped in this village in the past fortnight.

Forest department officials said they were looking into whether there were other leopards hiding in the surrounding areas.

“Around 4.30am, forest department officials received a mobile phone alert from the cameras installed nearby that the leopard was trapped in the field belonging to farmer Santosh Jadhav,” Trimbak Jarad, round officer, said.

A four-member rescue team and eight forest department officials reached the spot immediately. The leopard was shifted to the animal rescue centre at Bhugaon, near Pune.

“The Nira left bank canal passes through the village and there is abundant water available for irrigation. So sugar cane is grown on a large scale here, providing good hiding place for leopards,” Jarad explained.

“A cage was installed in Jadhav’s field three days ago. The leopard prowled around the cage on Wednesday and was trapped in it on Thursday morning,” Jarad said.

He said the forest department has compensated villagers in eight cases. “We will soon give compensation in the remaining cases too,” Jarad said.

The Khajod SDB site at present has no resemblance to its ‘dirty’ past as the SMC’s dumpyard a year ago (below)

Surat: The toxic solid waste landfill site of Surat Municipal Corporation (SMC) near the Surat Diamond Bourse (SDB) at Khajod has now transformed into lush green lawns spread over 30 hectare land.

SDB is coming up on 35 acres land at the Diamond Mercantile and Research (DREAM) city at Khajod at the cost of Rs 2,500 crore.

The civic body on Friday officially closed down the landfill site spread in total 60 hectare by disposing off around 25 lakh tonne solid waste that had accumulated there over the years. As such the SMC had stopped dumping solid wastes at the site in 2014 following order of the National Green Tribunal (NGT), but the site was open as the waste need to be dispose of scientifically.

According to SMC estimates, Surat city generates 1,800 tonne of solid waste every day.

“We started capping solid waste at the site one and a half years ago and followed all the solid waste management rules. We also adopted all the prescribed guidelines in managing the waste. Out of the 60 hectare land at the site, we have fully reclaimed 30 hectare and this open space is now transformed into lush green lawns,’’ said a senior SMC official.

The official further said that Rs 60 crore was spent in disposing off the solid waste scientifically.

“The open space now adds value to the area where the SDB, the second diamond bourse after the Bharat Diamond Bourse (SDB) in Mumbai, is coming up,” an SMC official added.

The construction work for the SDB started in October 2017 and it is likely to be completed by the end of 2020.

The diamond bourse will have 66 lakh sq ft built up area with nine iconic towers housing 4,000 offices of the diamantaires.

Madurai: Irked by the slow progress in the Smart City work taken up in all four Masi Streets, a large number of traders staged a road blockade, urging the Madurai Corporation to complete the work at the earliest.

More than 200 traders gathered at the Murugan Temple in West Masi Street, one of the busiest commercial places in the city, and staged the protest . The protesters wore masks highlighting the dust pollution, that is one of the major issues they face due to the ongoing work.

As the vehicular movement in the street came to a standstill, police personnel held talks with them urging them to withdraw the protest. As the traders were reluctant, around 80 of them were arrested and shifted to a hall. They were released later.

S Selvapandi, secretary of Federation of Madurai Manufacturers and Traders Association, said they have been running from pillar to post, seeking clarification like date of completion, whether there will be space left for parking two-wheeler after completion, contact details of contractor and corporation engineers, but they did not get any satisfactory reply so far.

“It has been three months since pits were dug up on the roadsides of all Masi Streets. We have been undergoing all sorts of problems. We face difficulty in shifting materials to shops, dust issues and slashed sale and parking space. While trade has already been affected after the implementation of GST, smart city work has come as a double blow,” Selvapandi said. The traders said that while they welcome the project for the overall development of the city, however, work should be expedited by deploying more workers. They also said that night time could be utilized more efficiently to complete work. TNN

Panaji: After multiple delays, parking will be chargeable for two- and four-wheelers on nine stretches in the state capital beginning Saturday. The Rs 1.6 crore pay-parking contract between the Corporation of the City of Panaji and the contractor was signed on Thursday and will be valid for three years.

Special discounted passes will be issued at the mezzanine floor of the Kwality Walls building on M G Road from Monday for motorists who regularly use the areas notified for pay-parking.

“We are in the process of developing an app where citizens won’t have to visit the office for the passes to be issued. This will be ready in the next few months,” contractor Sohan Juwarker said.

The workers engaged to issue electronically generated receipts have also been trained to be polite and to treat customers well. The receipts they issue will contain the date, time and registration number of the vehicle concerned.

Pay-parking signage displaying rates per hour have already been put up around the city, including on 18th June Road, around the Church Square, around Garcia de Orta, around the old secretariat and in the Campal residential area.

Once charged, parking fees will be considered valid for any other parking location within CCP for that time slot for the vehicle concerned. Government vehicles will be exempted from pay-parking in the state capital.

CCP’s last pay-parking contract ended on April 30, 2017, and neither brought in the required revenue for the cash-strapped corporation nor helped ease traffic congestion in the city. Mayor Uday Madkaikar said all this is set to change.

“Pay-parking will reduce congestion. This time around, CCP is also secured as the contractor has deposited a Rs 96 lakh bank guarantee for three years along with a 10 per cent security deposit. He has also given us 36 postdated checks of Rs 4.5 lakh each,” he said.

If the project is successful, CCP will consider implementing it in other parts of the city too.

The British Deputy High Commission in Hyderabad kick-started a climate change campaign focusing on Telangana and Andhra Pradesh. The campaign is part of the mission’s efforts in the run-up to the climate change summit (COP26) to be held in Glasgow later this year.

“Since the 1990s, the UK government’s policies have ensured substantial reduction in emissions while increasing growth,” said Andrew Fleming, British Deputy High Commissioner, Hyderabad.

Shantipath is one of the sites where these plants have been grown in ample number

NEW DELHI: A colourful floral surprise is waiting to bloom in the gardens of Lutyens’ Delhi. Over 20,000 bulbs of tulip, which were imported from Holland , are likely to bloom fully in central Delhi areas within a week.

Instead of conventional red, yellow, purple and cream shades, New Delhi Municipal Council (NDMC) has this time introduced over 12 new shades to welcome spring in the most colourful manner. Once they all bloom, it will be no less than a visual treat for Delhiites. Tulips usually bloom for 25 days. AIIMS roundabout, Lodhi Garden , 11 Murti Marg, Nehru Park, Shantipath, Talkatora Garden and Panchsheel Marg are some of the sites where these plants have been grown in ample number.

A senior NDMC official said that they had started the preparations well in advance this time. Efforts like importing bulbs before winters, keeping them in nursery for long time and planting them in gardens and roundabouts during peak winters are now yielding results.

“We have grown shades of tulip in combination with flowers of conventional colours. About 60% of them have already bloomed. The remaining flowers will take another week to gain their pristine beauty,” said NDMC horticulture director S Chellaiah.

Over 35,000 imported bulbs and seedlings of other varieties of flowers are also being planted to ensure that the Lutyens’ Delhi area remains colourful throughout the spring season. “Imported seedlings of daffodil, bearded iris, lilium, freesia, hyacinth, muscari and ranunculus have already been planted. In the next 10 days, they will gain full glory. Most of these have been grown at Shantipath. A mixture of varieties will ensure that the area looks like a colourful carpet of flowers,” said another official.

Apart from the exotic imported varieties, indigenous species of flowering plants such as petunia, salvia, chrysanthemum and dianthus will also add to the beauty quotient of the Central Delhi. At least two hues of iris (blue and white) and different types of hyacinth and lilies have bloomed already.

NDMC has also deputed guards to protect these plants. “We request people to treat the plants carefully so that we may introduce more varieties in future,” added the official.

Swara Bhasker said the event was planned to highlight multiple shades and voices

NEW DELHI: Valentine’s Day can be a celebration of India, actor Ratna Pathak Shah said while performing Ismat Chughtai’s ‘Hindustan Chhod Do’ at ‘India, My Valentine’, an event organised by Jawaharlal Nehru University students on Valentine’s Day.

Calling the event different from a protest , the actor said, “We should remind ourselves through this the idea of India that we remember.” If artistes feel for something, they can find a way to speak, she emphasised.

The event, which started with a one-minute silence for the Pulwama martyrs, also had actor Swara Bhasker as a participant who said it was planned to highlight “multiple shades and different conversations at JNU. We wanted to celebrate love today”.

The programme, though, had its share of the anti-CAA/NRC narratives, with one of the stand-up comics, Varun Thakur, in an apparent reference to the January 5 violence, joking about how he expected to see people beating up students on the campus. He later told TOI his maiden visit was a “welcome change from what you keep hearing about the university”.

Stand-up comic Aditi Mittal said she decided to perform as she regarded India as her Valentine. “We love India and we wanted to show our love for India. CAA is violating Article 14 of our Constitution.” Sanjay Rajoura, another artiste, said, “If I don’t speak up, I have no right to call myself an Indian.”

Manik Mahana, who claimed to be the “most sensible right-winger” stand-up artiste, said sometimes we “need our own people to provoke us so that we know what it is like when someone provokes us”.

Before the event, a few students protested in support of JNU student Sharjeel Imam, facing sedition charges, and questioned the student union’s decision to call off an event in his support on Thursday. However, Saket Moon, JNU Students’ Union vice-president, said the union would hold a protest for Sharjeel on Saturday.

The protesters also submitted a letter to Haryana CM Manohar Lal Khattar

NEW DELHI: On Friday morning, a group of college-goers gathered outside Haryana Bhavan and took part in a silent protest to oppose encroachment in the Aravalis and to highlight the depleting forest cover in the green zone.

“On this day of love, we want people to start loving natural resources and understand that we need Aravalis more than they need us. It is a question of our existence,” said 22-year-old Simran Seth, who is pursuing bachelor’s in History from Delhi University .

The primary demand of the green brigade was the rollback of the controversial Punjab Land Preservation (Haryana Amendment) Act, which was passed by the Haryana government in February 2019 and will open 60,000 acres of forests for real estate development.

Under the banner of Aravali Bachao Citizens Movement — which includes residents of Delhi, Gurugram and Faridabad — the protesters submitted a letter to Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar.

The protesters said that another 50,000 acres of Aravali forests, which do not have the protection of the PLPA or any other forest law, were at a greater risk of destruction. “This means that effectively, the entire Aravali range in south Haryana will get impacted by the government’s move to amend the PLPA. The amended bill seeks to benefit the real estate sector at the cost of forests, wildlife, water security, air quality and the health and well-being of millions living in NCR,” Neelam Ahluwalia of the Aravali Bachao Citizens Movement said. The activists demanded the PLPA Amendment Bill be withdrawn and the 50,000 acres of Aravali forests, such as Mangar Bani and other areas, that have not been notified as deemed forests be notified and brought under the protection of law.

Aurangabad: The state minister for tourism, environment and protocol Aaditya Thackeray has raised the issue of the absence of footpaths in the city with the civic body which has sought funds from the state government for road development.

On Thursday, Thackeray along with district guardian minister and industry minister Subhash Desai chaired a meeting at the district collectorate to discuss the various projects proposed to be funded by the government.

Talking about the road project, Thackeray said that the government would provide the financial assistance required for the roads but the Aurangabad Municipal Corporation has to ensure the work is completed. He said that he has noticed that there are no footpath at some place and in some the footpaths are either broken or waste lying around it.

He asked the civic body to ensure that during the road construction, there should be a provision for footpaths. The AMC was also asked to make sure that waste is not dumped on footpaths and the broken footpaths are repaired. In place of the railings installed at the footpaths, Thackeray suggested to place plants in pots, for which funds can be obtained from the state government under the Navinya Purna Yojana.

The AMC presented a hefty file of projects demanding Rs 1,534 crore from the state government. The two major projects in the file were road construction project costing Rs 462 crore and Rs 500 crore for Satara and Deolai development.

In a report published on December 16, 2018, TOI had highlighted how the pedestrians in the city have to struggle on a daily basis in the absence of footpaths in the city.

Aurangabad: During a meeting held at the district collectorate on Thursday, it was decided that the vision document prepared under the smart city project of Aurangabad will be used for conservation and promotion of city’s heritage.

The document outlines the heritage conservation projects — the ones that have been initiated and those that have been proposed.

The document states that the Aurangabad Smart City Development Corporation Ltd. (ASCDCL) had proposed a tender for the conservation and beautification of nine historical gates in the city i.e. Barapulla Gate, Mehmood Darwaza, Roshan Gate, Katkat Gate, Jafar Gate, Paithan Gate, Kala Darwaza, Naubat Darwaza and Khijri Gate. The proposal was designed for the ASCDCL by the Indian National Trust for Art and Cultural Heritage (Intach). The work is being carried out at the total cost of Rs 3.2 crore. The technical bids for eight gates have been opened. However, the tender for the Mehmood Gate will be recalled as there is no response from any bidders.

The ASCDCL has also proposed to develop a tourist circuit to connect key heritage sites in the city to enhance visitor experience with an aim to boost tourism. According to the draft plan as reflected in the heritage vision document, the tourist circuit development will include removal of encroachments, traffic regulation and public transport connectivity, improvement of approach road, well designed road junctions, proper road furniture, provision of parking space and illumination along the road and on the heritage structures.

The sites are i.e. Quila-e-ark, Himayat Baug, Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Museum and green areas such as Salim Ali lake will be conserved and developed as per the plan.

297,['15/02/2020'],Audit finds funds swindled in river navigation dept,"This story is from February 15, 2020

Panaji: In scathing observations over the functioning of the river navigation department (RND), the office of the principal accountant general has blamed the department for “systemic failure” and “lack of financial accountability”. The findings, which are reflected in an audit report for the period 2014-2019, show that lack of oversight and monitoring has led to a near Rs 3 crore loss to the public exchequer.

Auditors have suggested that the loss could be much higher since the cash book for 2018-19 and 2019-20 was not prepared while several other deficiencies were found in the functioning of the department.

The audit found that the RND has no system of recording and tallying how many tickets are sold on each ferry boat and there was no mechanism to ensure that the “entire money” from the sale of tickets was deposited in the government account.

A random audit of ferry routes observed that on the Keri-Tiracol route, cash collected between May 2017 and September 2017 was deposited in April 2018, a delay of six to 11 months.

“One of the flotilla staff who had deposited toll fees after one year from the date of collection was only issued a show cause notice. A staff was promoted even though he had failed to deposit cash collected before promotion and the toll fee collection was deposited after one year from the date of promotion,” the audit report said.

This, stated the audit report, resulted in “leakage of timely revenue due to misappropriation of cash” and indicated “weak internal controls” within the department.

Congress, which released the report after obtaining it through RTI, alleged that senior department heads were involved in the misappropriation of funds.

“Nobody is keeping an eye on what is happening in the department. Officers are looting the department and corruption has increased tremendously,” said party spokesperson Amarnath Panjikar.

The audit report also found that the department had converted a ferryboat into a pleasure craft, incurring “wasteful expenditure” of Rs 30.5 lakh, without preparing a technical feasibility report. At the same time, the department purchased three new ferry boats for Rs 63.7 lakh.

Hyderabad: The first meeting of turmeric traders and farmers on Thursday organised by the Spices Board after the announcement of a regional extension centre in Nizamabad saw growers fuming after having to undersell their produce.

Farmers bemoaned that traders were not offering them a good price despite their produce having a good percentage of curcumin. They faulted the state government for fixing the eNAM price at Rs 4,000 per quintal when their production cost was more than Rs 4,000. “In Maharashtra’s Sangli market, the eNAM price is Rs 6,000 per quintal. We want the Telangana government to fix the price first and bail us out. We cannot survive if we do not get a good price,” rued farmer Madhusudan Reddy.

The national agriculture market (eNAM) is an electronic trading portal which networks with the agriculture market committees to create a unified market for agricultural commodities, including turmeric.

The growers said the traders merely offered Rs 200 to Rs 300 over and above the eNAM price. “Sometimes, we get just Rs 2,000 per quintal and end up with a loss of Rs 25,000 per acre. With the situation not improving and the government not helping us get an MSP, many of us are not willing to cultivate turmeric,” farmer Srikanth Reddy said.

The growers said their counterparts in Maharashtra had sold turmeric at rates as high as Rs 8,500 per quintal two years ago. “Earlier, turmeric there used to be sold at Rs 2,000 or Rs 3,000 per quintal,” another farmer said.

The meeting saw presence of more than 100 traders and 60 farmers. With exporters and traders demanding totally dried turmeric, which fetches a better rate, the growers were caught unawares. “We do not have enough knowledge about this. The horticulture department should help us out,” some farmers said.

Some exporters told farmers that they were forced to import turmeric from Indonesia and African countries. Interestingly, some traders were okay with farmers demanding Rs 15,000 MSP per quintal.

Panaji: With Fomento Industrial Pvt Ltd deciding to move out of Sonsoddo , waste management minister Michael Lobo on Friday said he would hold a meeting of the Goa Waste Management Corporation (GWMC) to decide who will manage the dump.

Lobo told TOI that he has moved a note to chief minister Pramod Sawant to convene a meeting of the corporation. He said though the corporation doesn’t operate the site, it could appoint a contractor to treat wet waste.

“We have to put a mechanism in place to find out how much wet waste is generated in the Margao Municipal Council (MMC) jurisdiction and the money required to treat the same. We have to ascertain whether the council is in a position to bear the expenses of the contractor,” Lobo said.

He further said that until a solid waste management plant at Verna becomes a reality, it would be tough to solve South Goa’s garbage problem.

The district court on Thursday had disposed of the case upon a plea by Fomento Industrial Pvt Ltd seeking withdrawal of the case it had filed for claiming service agreement payment. The court had set a seven-day timeframe for the civic body to decide whether it would operate the plant or not.

Meanwhile, MMC, at a special meet on Friday, decided to ask the government how to handle the Sonsoddo plant.

Panaji: A few residents of a housing colony were left in a state of panic after they saw a Chinese family that had recently arrived in the country moving around in the complex. Fearing exposure to the new coronavirus, they informed the state health authorities, who rushed to the colony on Friday morning to assess the situation

“We have spoken to the family and they have told us that they haven’t interacted with anyone. The family is following our instructions,” state epidemiologist Dr Utkarsh Betodkar said.

The Chinese family of three arrived in India on February 1, and has been under the watch of the health authorities since February 8 after the department was notified of their presence in Goa, Betodkar said.

“The family has completed 14 days of house quarantine and none of the three have shown any symptoms of the novel Coronovirus,” he said. As per the disease control protocol, people under home quarantine are monitored for 28 days by a local authority, Betodkar said, adding that his department has been strictly following guidelines in force.

“We cannot lock people in their homes. We advise them not to mingle with people. Even when interacting with their family, they are asked to maintain a distance of about a meter or two,” he said.

One of the building’s residents said people residing in the colony got worried when they spotted the Chinese man walking in the park last evening. “There were lot of people around, including children and elderly people. He has used the building’s elevator, and was seen moving around before completing the 28-day quarantine period,” she said.

To ally fears, a primary health centre official interacted with the residents, Betodkar said, adding that if people suspect that any person with a travel history is not taking necessary precautions, they should talk to the health official of their area to clear doubts.

303,['15/02/2020'],Co-op lenders asked to unveil OTS scheme for borrowers,"This story is from February 15, 2020

Panaji: In an effort to bring down the number of unpaid loans, co-operative societies in the state have been asked to give borrowers relief by devising a one-time settlement scheme (OTS) for those who find it difficult to repay their loans. The registrar for co-operative societies has also issued guidelines to be followed while implementing the OTS scheme .

Those who took loans before March 31, 2015, and where the loans have been classified as defaults, will be eligible for the scheme, which will remain in force till September 30, 2020.

Sources said that the government has recommended the OTS scheme to provide relief to co-operative societies and agricultural credit societies in the hinterland and the mining belt.

Registrar of co-operative societies Vikas Gaunekar said that the OTS scheme does not apply for co-operative banks and co-operative societies.

“To speed up recovery and also to give relief to the affected borrowers, it is necessary that all the credit co-operative societies shall devise an OTS scheme for borrowers,” Gaunekar said.

Multipurpose co-operative societies, agricultural societies and urban co-operative credit societies face a shortage of funds as several loans remain unpaid and they are also forced to make provisions towards non-performing assets (NPA). “This has resulted into mounting of NPAs against which the appropriate provisioning needs to be done in the balance sheet to avoid further erosion of owned funds,” Gaunekar said.

To prevent abuse of the scheme, the department has specified guidelines based on which each credit co-operatives shall frame their own OTS scheme and obtain approval from their respective board and general body.

Hyderabad: With support for the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) reportedly swelling in Hyderabad after the Delhi poll results, a meeting will be organised by the party with its leaders, volunteers and new members on February 16 in the city. The party’s Telangana state observer, Priyanka Kakkar, who campaigned for party candidates during the 2018 assembly elections in Telangana, will address the gathering at the party’s office near GHMC office near Liberty.

AAP Telangana state convener, Burra Ramu Goud, told TOI that the party office was inundated with calls from February 8 itself, when Delhi went to polls. The number of calls enquiring about membership increased after the results were out on February 11 when Delhi chief minister Arvind Kerjiwal led the party to victory once again.

According to Ramu Goud, a large number of NGOs, intellectuals, and educated people, including doctors and lawyers had expressed interest to join AAP. In addition, some leaders from other political parties are also expected to attend the meeting on February 16.

After AAP got elected once again in 2014, the party’s membership programme got it 40,000 people. The latest figures, though not accurate, are said to be around one lakh. “AAP volunteers will go door-to-door to find out the problems of the people. They will be invited to take party membership if they so desire,” Syed Gaffar, state core committee member, said.

There is no membership fee but there are some conditions. One of them is the potential member should not have been convicted for any offence involving moral turpitude. In the last assembly elections in December 2018, AAP contested from 50 assembly but did not win from any. With the meetings that will be organised with new members, the party intends to gear up for the GHMC elections in the city.

306,['15/02/2020'],Two illegally adopted babies saved from village in Madurai,"This story is from February 15, 2020

Madurai: A casual enquiry by a villager to the Child Welfare Committee (CWC) in Madurai resulted in the rescue of two babies who were illegally adopted by childless couples at Kuppalnatham village, about 50km from Madurai city. The couple had adopted the babies from Hyderabad.

The babies aged 21 months and 3 months were rescued amidst high drama, with the illegal parents pleading with police not to take away the children.

The illegal adoption came to light when a villager called the CWC on Thursday enquiring about the formalities for adopting a child. The caller spilled the beans when the CWC started asking questions. Based on an alert from the CWC, superintendent of police of Madurai district N Manivannan and a team led by the additional superintendent of police S Vanitha conducted the rescue operation that started in the morning and went on till night.

Preliminary enquiry by police revealed that naickers are the dominant community at Kuppalnatham. “Some relatives of these families had migrated to Hyderabad and nearby areas to earn a livelihood. They do odd jobs or run roadside shops there,” said a police officer.

It is through those relatives in Hyderabad that the childless couples at Kuppalnatham illegally adopted the babies. Kasiviswanathan, a lorry driver, and Mathuvathi who were married for 13 years but did not have children adopted a 24-day-old girl baby about 20 months ago. She is 21 months old now.

Venkatesan, a farmer, and Dhanalakshmi who did not have children for 25 years adopted a 5-day-old baby and are raising her for the past three months. There were unconfirmed claims that the babies were purchased for Rs 75,000 to Rs 1 lakh each.

On Friday afternoon, police led by Peraiyur sub division DSP Mathiyalagan, CWC members B Pandiaraja and L Shanmugam, district child protection officer A Ganesan and personnel from the anti-human trafficking unit reached Kuppalnatham. Sensing something wrong, more than 100 villagers surrounded the team.

As tension built up, ADSP Vanitha went to the spot and police explained to the villagers the seriousness of the issue. It was found that the couples were not aware of the formalities involved in adopting children and they had been taking good care of the babies. They requested the officials to allow them to spend two more days with the babies as they couldn’t bear to part with them. Police explained that it is not legally possible and that the CWC will take a decision in the best interest of the children.

CWC lodged a complaint with the Sedapatti police who said a case will be registered late on Friday night. Meanwhile, the biological parents of the two babies were asked to appear before police for enquiry. An officer said they have started from Hyderabad and are expected by Saturday.

“A probe will be conducted to find details about the sale of the babies and to ascertain if there are more such illegal adoptions,” said a senior police officer.

CHENNAI: O Panneerselvam has made some assumptions in preparing his tenth state Budget. But they may be way too optimistic.His assumes the economy, in slowdown mode for the past few fiscals, will not just revive, but do so significantly. So the state has budgeted tax collection to rise 10% next fiscal when it fell 3.22% in the current year based on revised estimates.The finance minister admitted in his Budget speech on Friday that the state would grow at 7.27% in the current fiscal as against 8.17% the previous year. But he assumes that the state will grow faster than the 7.27% witnessed in the current year, notwithstanding economic headwinds. The Indian economy is expected to grow at 5%. There is no growth guidance from the government for 2020-21.Tamil Nadu continues to live beyond its means. The revenue deficit (when realized income is less than projected income) soared to Rs25,071 crore from the budgeted Rs14,314 crore. The government hopes this deficit will drop to Rs21,617.64 crore, even though it is an election year. Simply put, the government’s revenues are used to pay interests and salaries when it should be used to create assets.With GST collections slowing with the economy, funding the state’s ambitious welfare schemes, seen by some as freebies, would become a stretch. However, with elections next year, the state cannot afford to withdraw any of its announcements, which includes free goats and ceiling fans. In a weak year (2019-20) the subsidies and transfers are pegged to grow 8%.“Though there is a slowdown at present, the Indian economy is expected to gain momentum in the coming years. Tamil Nadu’s growth is higher than that of national GDP, which is a positive sign. This growth is expected to further strengthen in the coming years,” said Panneerselvam.“The revenue deficit in the revised estimates has increased by Rs7,000 crore compared to the 2019-20 budget due to the lowering of Central’s tax share. Due to slowdown the tax revenue in the Central pool came down and due to this our share also lowered,” said finance secretary S Krishnan in a post-budget interaction.“The state finances are weak, and it has been unable to meet tax revenue targets in the past few years. It is borrowing to meet the expenditure in the revenue account,” said Madras School of Economics director K R Shanmugam.Economists accused the government of hiding behind GSDP numbers expecting a 7.24% growth to show fiscal deficit under 3% of GSDP as per the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management Act (FRBM). “As per the Act there must be no deficit in the revenue account or if there is, it must be within 1%,” said Shanmugam.",chennai,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74143858,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-384391,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/tn-economy-on-a-wing-and-a-prayer/articleshow/74143519.cms

PONDA: Chief minister Pramod Sawant on Friday said Goa could get a third district by next year that would include the Dharbandora taluka. The move, he said, was aimed at speedy development of the region.

Sawant, who spoke after inaugurating the administrative building of the Dharbandora taluka, said the state’s population was increasing and that facilities needed to be within the reach of all people.

During his tenure as minister, incumbent Congress Ponda MLA Ravi Naik had proposed a third district for the state by including the talukas of Ponda, Sattari and Sanguem and by setting up the headquarters in Ponda town. Stating that this would aid the speedy development of Ponda and surrounding areas, Naik had said it would also benefit Mollem, Collem and Sanvordem, whose residents presently have to travel to Margao or Panaji to get their work done. Land for a collectorate building had also been identified.

The administrative building at Dharbandora that was inaugurated on Friday is spread over 3,400sqm and will house major offices, including that of the deputy collector and mamlatdar.

Akansha and Shoaib

NEW DELHI: When Ankur Bihari, a government employee, met Nasreen Sheikh, it was love at first sight for both of them. However, when they planned to tie the knot a few months later, their families not only opposed the interfaith wedding, but Sheikh was locked up in her house in Mumbai, which forced her to quit her job.

What followed was nothing short of a Bollywood flick. Bihari approached a Mumbai court demanding Sheikh be produced there. Following the court ruling, Sheikh stayed in a dormitory till Bihari made arrangements for their wedding.

Seven months into the wedding, the couple are now advocates for interfaith marriages. They attended an annual confluence named “Love Against Hate” organised by NGO Dhanak, which also provides aide to couples who wish to marry out of their religion or caste. The confluence was organised on Valentine ’s Day to celebrate the love between 51 such couples.

Sheikh recalled that her elder brother was the one who opposed the marriage. Her phone was taken away, but she managed to converse with Bihari on Facebook messenger. Ankur’s family saw the Facebook post of their wedding and blamed Sheikh for “trapping” him. However, they eventually accepted her. “The family will gradually introduce me to relatives,” she said.

The story of Pavitra and Khateeb is no less intriguing. Khateeb picked up Pavitra from her house in Mangalore and they fled to Dehradun. After Pavitra’s parents informed police, she was taken back to Mangalore. The duo breathed a sigh of relief after a strenuous legal battle. “We now share a good laugh over it at the dinner table,” Khateeb said.

Another couple, Shoaib and Akansha, had a similar tale to narrate. They had approached Dhanak to solemnise their marriage. “Shoaib’s family is yet to accept me fully as they haven’t told anyone that we are married,” said Akansha. Asif Iqbal, co-founder of Dhanak, said, “The campaign will continue for a year to boost the confidence of such couples to come out and talk about it. We have a home for couples in Shahdara too.”

Aurangabad: The special cell of the state police — cracking down cases of human trafficking and Prevention of Atrocities against women (PAW) — has sent out a letter asking authorities to arrest habitual offender and gangs involved in human trafficking under the stringent Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act (MCOCA).

The letter issued by special inspector general of police (PAW) Pratap Dighavkar has been sent to all commissioners and superintendents of police in the state citing that of late investigation in cases of human trafficking have revealed unheard trends.

Issuing a list of directives, the letter has asked the authorities to impose amended sections 370 and 370-A of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) instead of sections 372, 373, 376 and 363 of the IPC, sections of Prevention of The Immoral Traffic (Prevention) Act (ITPA) 1956, provided the contents match these sections.

The authorities have also been directed to initiate stringent preventive action against habitual offenders involved in human trafficking, prepare a list of habitual offenders in their respective jurisdictions and initiate steps for cancellations of their bails.

The communication specifically mentions that the authorities should obtain legal opinion and accordingly initiate the process of slapping MCOCA on gangs involved in human trafficking.

All deputy commissioners of police (DCP) rank officers in commissionorate areas and deputy superintendent of police (DySP) rank officials in district areas have been directed to mandatorily carry out two review meetings each month in cases registered for rape, kidnaping for marriage, kidnapping for human trafficking and flesh trade.

The senior officers have been asked to personally supervise the investigation in these cases and closely coordinate with the investigation officers to ensure that these cases not only sustain the test of law and evidence in the court of law, but also reach their logical end.

Legal experts maintained that Criminal Law (amendment) Act, 2013, has come into force wherein section 370 of the IPC has been substituted with section 370 and 370A, which provide for comprehensive measures to counter the menace of human trafficking, including trafficking of children for exploitation in any form including physical exploitation or any form of sexual exploitation, slavery, servitude, or the forced removal of organs.

Authorities confirmed that as the amended sections provide more stringent action against the culprits involved in human trafficking, the investigative agencies are being asked to opt for these sections instead of the old ones.

Panaji: In a major revelation regarding the investigation into the death case of former Merces sarpanch Prakash Naik, the prosecution on Friday told the high court of Bombay at Goa that the “original scene of offence” was not available to the police.

The prosecution’s statement came after the court asked about the position of Naik’s body and whether there was any residual gunpowder from the gunshot. The court was hearing the anticipatory bail application filed by panchayats minister Mauvin Godinho’s brother, Wilson, in connection with Naik’s alleged suicide.

Additional public prosecutor Pravin Faldessai told the court that the scene of offence was lost and later reconstructed, and that the police came into the picture only after Naik was declared brought dead at the Goa Medical College and hospital, (GMC) Bambolim.

There was also no conclusive gunpowder residue, he said, adding that a team has been constituted to travel to Delhi to obtain an immediate report to ascertain whether the gun was used by Naik himself, instead of relying on the laboratory at Hyderabad which could take some time.

In her complaint to the police, Naik’s sister had stated that when she saw his body, she found the revolver used in the incident lying on his chest. She said that while the revolver was under a blanket, her brother’s mobile phone was above the blanket. She also said both his hands were under the blanket.

Faldessai told the court that no angle of investigation was closed and that all angles were being probed. He said the possibility of murder is also being considered and presented the names of three additional suspects identified on February 11, 12 and 13. He, however, did not disclose the names in the open court.

Senior counsel Nitin Sardessai, representing Wilson, told the court that the cheque of Rs 35 lakh dated December 20, 2019 signed by Naik and produced by his sister to the court, was in not submitted to the investigating officer as evidence.

He said that the authenticity of the WhatsApp message sent by Naik minutes before his death must be verified and added that the police were under pressure to file an FIR after Naik’s family threatened that they would not cremate the body.

Sardessai also said that Wilson’s custody was not required as the police already had the messages that Naik had sent and that Wilson had already produced property documents to the police.

Wilson had knocked the doors of the high court after the sessions court rejected his anticipatory bail application last month.

The case will continue on Tuesday.

NEW DELHI: Despite issuing a statement against it, several students at Delhi University’s Hindu College boys’ hostel held the infamous “Damdami Mai Puja” on Valentine’s Day. However, another set objected to this “tradition” alleging that it objectified women and sat on dharna outside the principal office.

Meanwhile, just across the road, St Stephen’s College decided not to conduct its Valentines’ Day event of ANGA oath for second year in a row.

For the Hindu College “tradition”, which has been going on for decades, students gather to worship a V-shaped “Virgin Tree” and paste pictures of an actress, christening her as “Damdami Mai”. But due to protests for the past couple of years, the students had decided to do away with it. The groups from both the girls’ and the boys’ had even landed an agreement to change the decade-old practice. However, despite it, several students gathered on Friday to celebrate the tradition.

In their agreement, the students had decided to make the practice inclusive by celebrating “all forms of love, friendship and romance.” “No puja of any conventional sense, which has taken place in the past, will be held and only a mutual celebration organised by both the hostels will take place for the entire college,” the statement said.

Despite this, many students from the boys’ hostel on Friday shouted slogans of ‘Damdami puja hoke rahegi’ and pasted pictures of actors Ranveer Singh and Deepika Padukone.

Ujjwal, president, Hindu College boys’ hostel, who had signed the agreement earlier, did not want to comment on this issue.

Speaking to TOI, Anju Srivastava, Hindu College principal said, “There was an agreement to keep the event inclusive. However, there are students who claimed that the agreement was violated. We will look into the issue.”

SECUNDERABAD: To ease traffic flow in Secunderabad constituency, the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) and Hyderabad Metropolitan Water Supply and Sewerage Board (HMWS&SB) began road restoration works on Friday, almost a year after announcement for the works was made. The works began after deputy speaker T Padma Rao Goud inaugurated a 1.5 km stretch between Shahbazguda and Mohammadguda at Sitaphalmandi division in the constituency.

Though the state government had sanctioned nearly Rs 8 crore for the works and roads on various stretches in Secunderabad were dug up, the works were stalled as contractors could not take them up due to rains during monsoon last year. Around 50 km to 60 km of road has been dug up by the GHMC at various places in Secunderabad.

Padma Rao said that the internal roads in Secunderabad will get a facelift after completion of works that will be carried out in a phased manner. “Stern action will be taken against contractors who fail to complete the works on time,” informed the deputy speaker.

He also inaugurated water and sewer pipeline works at a cost of Rs 50 lakh in slum areas that include Kindi Basti, Bidala Basti, Shahbajguda, Mohammadguda and Gampala Galli in Chilkalguda and Sitaphalmandi.

Aurangabad: With an aim to promote the habit of reading among youths and also provide a calm atmosphere for those preparing for different examinations, Osmanabad police have established a library-cum-study centre for commoners as well as policemen in Tuljapur—260km from Aurangabad city.

The library is the first in the region to be operated by the police that will remain open for all. The facility has been started in a spacious hall provided by the Tuljapur temple trust to Osmanabad police.

Superintendent of police Raj Tilak Roushan told TOI, “The huge space was lying idle for a long time. Hence, we decided to put it to good use by setting up a library, thereby creating a win-win situation for everyone, especially the youths. This initiative is also helping us in our outreach programmes.”

Roushan, who is an IIT alumni and an author himself, said there were several options for initiating different welfare programmes. “However, considering the addiction of youths to smartphones and social media, we were compelled to take the initiative of promoting reading culture and providing serene space to those preparing for school, college and competitive exams,” he said.

As a part of the initiative, several books sourced from different educational institutes and obtained from book enthusiasts have been made available for those visiting the library. Some academicians have been roped in for preparing a detailed list of books to be kept at the library. The books will include the ones required for preparating for state and national-level competitive exams, apart from the professional courses, so that the youths who are unable to purchase these books can read them at the library.

An officer said that as for now, the library was being operated only during the day and an assistant sub-inspector had been deployed for supervising the day-to-day affairs at the library.

Secunderabad: The Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) on Friday directed a property owner to pay Rs 50,000 as compensation before felling four trees in Kacheguda.

Nitin Ganeriwal approached the civic body officials and sought permission to fell four trees in front of a commercial building that he owns.

Maqsood Mohiuddin, deputy director of Urban Biodiversity (UBD) wing, GHMC (North Zone) who responded to Ganeriwal’s requisition, directed him to deposit Rs 50,000 for felling of four trees that were almost a decade old.

When TOI contacted Mohiuddin, he confirmed that Ganeriwal was told to pay the amount before cutting down the trees.

He added that the property owner had mentioned in the requisition that the trees were obstructing the elevation of a proposed commercial complex. “During inspection, we found that the area falls under GHMC’s jurisdiction and the trees were planted by us. So, we allowed the property owner to cut the trees provided he pays the compensation,” he said.

Hyderabad: Suspended senior IPS officer AB Venkateswara Rao on Thursday approached Central Administrative Tribunal (CAT), Hyderabad, questioning his suspension from service. The AP government had placed Rao, a DGP-rank officer, under suspension on February 8 stating the way he acted in the matter pertaining to procurement of security equipment during his stint as additional DG falls under serious misconduct.

Rao, in his plea, said state’s decision was contrary to All India Service Rules. A separate competent authority was designated for procuring security equipment and matter came to additional DGP at final stage for a formal approval, he said.

He said he was transferred from his post, DGP (ACB) post, on May 30, 2019 and was asked to report to general administration department. “In last eight months, no posting was given and no salary was paid to me,” Rao said, adding “I wrote two letters in January 2020 requesting the government to pay my salary and also give me some posting. It was not done.”

He questioned his suspension because it came without any notice and without formal inquiry against him. He sought cancellation of his suspension GO and payment of his salary with arrears. The tribunal said it would take up the case on Friday.

PANAJI: Goa police on Friday arrested a sixth person in connection with an attempt to extort money from PWD minister Deepak Pauskar .

The crime branch said Candolim resident Savio Alfie Lobo, 35, was arrested after a SIM card from which a call was made to Pauskar was found in his possession. Lobo has denied making the call.

The minister had said in January that some persons had threatened to defame him or get him killed if he didn’t cough up Rs 3 crore. He claimed to have received 30 extortion calls from Dubai and Gujarat. When they persisted, Pauskar said he called them to his official residence to collect the money.

There a trap was laid and three persons, who were natives of Maharashtra, were arrested on January 22.

A few days later, two others, this time from Gujarat, were arrested.

BENGALURU: The government could be forced to borrow heavily to fund development and welfare schemes in 2020-21, what with it set to incur a huge shortfall in revenue especially its share of central funds.With the Centre yet to reply to chief minister BS Yediyurappa’s letter seeking release of the special grant recommended by the 15th Finance Commission and with the Centre yet to release promised funds, finance department officials say the state might have to borrow over and above estimates in the previous budget.The 15th Finance Commission had recommended a special grant of Rs 5,495 crore for the state after it realized that it would get a raw deal under its new tax devolution formula. However, the Centre is reluctant to pay.Besides, the Centre owes the state Rs 17,270 crore in tax devolution for 2019-20. The state had hoped to get Rs 15,008 crore as central grant-in-aid, but the Centre has only released Rs 7,000 crore so far. There is also no word on when the Centre would pay GST compensation dues of about Rs 10,000 crore.Yediyurappa will broach the subject with Union finance minister Niramala Sitharaman, who is expected in Bengaluru on Sunday.It’s unclear how much the government is planning to borrow in 2020-21, but officials say it could be “huge”. “The shortfall in central funds is unprecedented, but we cannot divulge details now,” said a senior official, who added the budget will reveal all.Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management (FRBM) norms allow a state to borrow 3% of gross state domestic product (GSDP), which means Karnataka can borrow up to Rs 54,000 crore. However, former chief minister HD Kumaraswamy, in his budget for 2019-20, estimated borrowings at Rs 42,051 crore (2.6% of GSDP). The state therefore can borrow only Rs 12,000 crore more.Officials say this is inadequate, indicating the government may opt to borrow over and above FRBM limits. This will require the Centre’s sanction. “It may oblige since the Centre itself is borrowing heavily. There is no option but to borrow,” said Vinod Vyasulu, former director of Centre for Budget and Policy Studies.BDA Satya Babu Bose, executive director of Budget Centre, said Karnataka is among the few states which have shown robust tax collection despite the economic slowdown, but it is still being punished.“The Centre must set its house in order, otherwise progressive states like Karnataka will suffer because of the financial mismanagement by the Centre,” Bose said.",bengaluru,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74144116,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-456477,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/with-cut-in-funds-from-centre-karnatakas-debt-to-increase/articleshow/74141866.cms

Filmmaker Anurag Kashyap during a protest against CAA and NRC at Jamia Millia Islamia

NEW DELHI: Filmmaker Anurag Kashyap on Friday urged the protesters at Jamia to continue their fight against Citizenship Amendment Act and National Register of Citizens with perseverance.

Addressing them outside gate number 7, Kashyap said, “I saw a video made by Jamia students, which made me realise that I cannot keep quiet. This movement gives us strength. It lets me believe that we also have existence and we are not just cattle.” These lines were received with a rapturous applaud from the protesters, who have been sitting near the varsity for the last 64 days.

Raising slogans of “Inquilab Zindabad” along with the students, the filmmaker said that this movement was about taking back the Constitution and the country. “We need to come out in large numbers and protest silently and without any violence. This is a long fight and will not get over with one election. We will continue to stay here till they come out and answer all our questions,” he added.

Taking a jibe at the central government, Kashyap said: “This government engages only in monologue, and not dialogue. It understands violence, but not empathy and love.” “They say that CAA is not for the ones living in the country. But we don’t believe in what they say. We will fight till they take the law back or answer all our questions,” he added.

When students asked him to lead the slogan raising, Kashyap said, “I speak from my heart and will follow you guys”.

He went on to add, “If a kid dies at Shaheen Bagh, the government puts a question mark on the entire protest. But when anyone speaks against Modi in Karnataka, the parents are put into jail.”

The filmmaker later visited Shaheen Bagh to extend his solidarity to the protesters there as well.

329,['15/02/2020'],Centre assures Goa of Rs 250cr more to complete highway works: Pauskar,"This story is from February 15, 2020

Panaji: Union minister of state for road transport and highways V K Singh on Friday assured the state government that his ministry would sanction an additional Rs 250 crore to complete the national highway widening works and set a December 2020 deadline to complete the ongoing works.

Earlier in the day, Singh held a meeting with PWD minister Deepal Pauskar, transport minister Mauvin Godinho and government officials to review the national highway works. During the interaction, the Union minister advocated underground and vertical parking systems and called for better utilisation of land for new projects as land is scarce in Goa.

The new deadline for completing the bridge over Zuari is April 2021, Pauskar told TOI.

He said that due to the delay in completing national highway expansion works, the cost has gone up and Singh has assured to sanction additional funds for the same.

The Centre will sanction Rs 175 crore for the western bypass and Rs 50 crore to construct two underpasses at Colvale, Pauskar said.

The PWD minister said that the Centre would sanction Rs 8 crore for completing the missing link at Loutolim. Singh has assured to release the payment of a contractor who is widening the road from Varunapuri to Sada which has stopped due to delay in payment, the project is a joint venture project, he said.

Pauskar said that the state government has also given the Union minister a proposal of new works, including construction of new Borim bridge, widening of road from Pollem to Karmalghat, Bicholim bypass, Mollem to Khandepar road, Bhoma flyover and Loutolim to Borim road.

Godinho urged the Union minister to consider Goa differently in comparison with the other states while extending financial cooperation.

An increase in vehicular population and the inflow of tourists have led to traffic congestion making widening of roads the need of the hour, Godinho told Singh. He said that the contractor had been directed to start work construction of six-lane flyover at Porvorim. Porvorim residents opposed the project had gone to the court, but there is no stay on the work so we have asked the contractor to start work, the minister said.

People of Porvorim want a four-lane bridge instead of six-lane, but that is not possible, he said. He also said that the government has agreed to increase the height of Porvorim flyover from 5.5m to 6m.

Picture used for representational purpose only

NEW DELHI: Delhi high court on Friday sought the Centre and Delhi government ’s stand on a plea seeking contempt action against them for not implementing judicial orders on use of loudspeakers in the national capital. Justice A K Chawla asked them to file status reports on the issue raised in the petition and listed the matter for hearing on May 15.

The plea by Sanjjiiv Kkumaar has claimed that there has been wilful disobedience of the high court’s September 4, 2019 order to abide by the circulars, standing orders and rules which permit use of loudspeakers and amplified music systems only up to 10 pm.

He contended that even the Supreme Court has given directions that loudspeakers should not be used between 10 pm and 6 am.

Apart from seeking contempt action for alleged non-compliance of the high court’s September 4, 2019 order, the petition has also sought directions to the Delhi government and the police to “ban use of loudspeakers (and not holy azaan or fazr) in all mosques in Delhi” between 10 pm and 6 am.

Arguing that loudspeakers were never part of any religion as the instrument came into existence only in 1924, the plea claims use of loudspeakers takes away the right of the citizens to speak with others, their right to read or think or the right to sleep.

The plea has sought directions to the authorities to remove loudspeakers atop any religious structures, saying they violated citizens’ rights, including those of minors and elderly people.

Earlier, another HC bench had asked the police to place before it the standing order issued with regard to usage of loudspeaker at religious places and also apprise it of steps they have taken to publicise the order.

KOLKATA: When the first East-West Metro train chugged out of the station on Friday, love was in the air and the passengers marked the occasion with red roses. “We are falling in love with Metro,” they shouted in unison.Commercial services of Kolkata’s Line 2, after all, was finally rolling out. And it was Valentine’s Day. Officials of Metro Railway and Kolkata Metro Rail Corporation (KMRC) made everyone feel special by offering roses and a glossy brochure that had information on all passengers needed to know about the Metro line.The first train pulled out of the Sector V station at 8am sharp. Metro Railway and KMRC had the right excuse for celebration: felicitation of the first East-West passenger, Rajib Roy. Everyone clapped and hurrahed. Amid the cheer, some passengers shouted: “We are falling in love with Metro”. KMRC’s general manager N C Karmali and chief engineer Biswanath Deewanjee said they were fortunate to be a part of East-West’s debut run. Railway minister Piyush Goyal had flagged of the section’s commissioning the day before.Though the onus of a seamless service of the state-of-the-art system was on them, Metro Railway’s principal chief operations manager (PCOM) Satyaki Nath and the others were in a light mood, travelling as co-passengers with the 100-odd people who bought the tokens to ride their much-awaited Metro.The commuters were from all age-groups. From 20-year-old college-goer Soumyabrata Chakraborty to 85-year-old Dipali Chowdhury — everyone was smiling, looking happy to travel together on this special day. The octogenarian had Metro Railway’s senior transportation manager Kaushik Mitra by her side for assistance. Helped to swipe the token and then boarding the train, Chowdhury looked intently as the platform screen gates (PSGs) closed in sync with the Metro coach’s doors. “Are these meant to prevent suicides?” she asked.The train was passing the Wipro crossing. Soma De Ghosh looked out of the window to see if she could spot her house at EE Block. The train took 13 minutes to reach Salt Lake Stadium. The timing, in fact, was maintained through the first day of service. Parimal Sharma, 65, a GD Block resident who took two rides to and from Karunamoyee and City Centre in the evening, said, “There are so many interesting features, but the best thing about the new Metro is the timing. The footfall varied at six different stations. Till, 7pm, around 13,495 commuters had travelled the East-West Metro, and Metro Railway had grossed an earning of Rs 1.3 lakh.The ridership peaked in the mid-morning and the evening. Sector V station saw a steady flow of passengers and so did City Centre. But Bengal Chemical didn’t have too many of them, even though it’s next to the Mani Square mall. There were quite a few youngsters who celebrated V-day with groupfies inside East-West Metro trains and stations. Among them were Nilotpal Sen, Nayna Ghosh, Abir Guha and Banya Roy. After taking a ride in the evening, they immediately posted their group picture on the Facebook, with captions like “We love East-West Metro” and “The Metro is our best V-Day present ever”.",kolkata,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74145196,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-803716,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/on-v-day-kolkata-falls-in-love-with-e-w-metro-as-trains-start-rolling-out/articleshow/74142398.cms

Osmania University

HYDERABAD: As the academic year is soon set to come to an end, scores of undergraduate and postgraduate students who will complete their course this year are approaching Osmania University (OU) with complaints of colleges retaining their original certificates .

Despite multiple circulars from the University Grants Commission (UGC) and the Union Ministry of Human Resource Development, several colleges in Telangana continue to retain original certificates of students due to the state government’s failure in clearing fee reimbursement dues.

According to college managements, the state government is yet to release approximately Rs 1,000 crore towards fee reimbursement dues for the last two academic sessions to hundreds of private colleges offering engineering, pharmacy, management and other courses. “As I will be appearing for job interviews shortly, I asked the administration to return my original certificates. However, they refused to return the certificates and informed that they have not received my fee reimbursement to the tune of Rs 1.50 lakh for the last two years,” said Thota Vinay, a final year engineering student.

Besides, other students who are yet to complete their course have also complained to OU stating that colleges are insisting students to pay tuition fee for the remaining year(s) of study.

The OU administration has warned managements of such practices and has decided to crack the whip on errant colleges. “Affiliated colleges offering UG/PG (professional/non-professional) courses are directed to return original certificates of the students and not to insist upon payment of tuition fee for the remaining year(s). If any college violates the directions, the university will take stringent action against the college,” read a letter to all its affiliated colleges by the OU deputy registrar on February 12.

As per UGC norms, self-attested certificates of students can be held valid by managements and if there is a need for physical verification of certificates, they should be returned immediately to the student. Collecting advance fees for the entire programme of study or for more than one semester/year in which a student is enrolled is strictly prohibited.

Delhi high court

NEW DELHI: Delhi high court on Friday sought Jawaharlal Nehru University’s response on a plea challenging its decision to change selection criteria for vacant teaching positions in its Centre for Historical Studies (CHS) after the posts were advertised.

While issuing notice to JNU seeking its stand on the petition, Justice A K Chawla directed the varsity not to fill the advertised vacancies till the next date of hearing on May 6.

The court was hearing a plea by two professors of CHS who contended that the varsity “illegally and unilaterally altered the selection criteria for the posts of assistant professor in CHS during the selection process.”

The petitioners argued that JNU had also shortlisted candidates for the posts based on the new criteria and sought quashing of the list of candidates shortlisted on the basis of the new “diluted criteria” and the interviews conducted.

It contended that JNU, after advertising the posts along with the requisite qualifications, decided to “dilute” the criteria during the selection process by asking the screening committee to remove the need for specialisations.

The petition said that by removing the requirement of specialisation, the varsity has rendered the posts as “open posts” for which someone with a masters’ degree can also apply.

335,['15/02/2020'],Approvals awaited to set up biomedical incinerator at GMC,"This story is from February 15, 2020

Panaji: Work on installing a state-of-the-art incinerator at the Goa Medical College ( GMC ) and hospital, Bambolim, will be taken up after required approvals are obtained.

“We hope to get all the permissions at the earliest to be able to commence work,” a hospital official said.

The proposed 100 kg per hour biomedical waste incinerator will consist of a primary and secondary chamber and an auto loading device in the form of a bucket elevator.

It will also have a continuous stack monitoring device, as specified under the Biomedical Waste Management (BMW) Rules 2016, and a self-supported mild steel rubber lined chimney.

Over the past few years, GMC has seen a major expansion, with a range of additional facilities being added to the services offered at the state’s premier hospital. With this, the need of a state-of-the-art incinerator is imminent.

The new incinerator will also have an air pollution control device in the form of a high pressure venturi scrubber system, as specified in the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) guidelines, he said.

The system will be equipped with a mechanism to prevent corrosion, as well as a packet column and re-circulation tank.

Other features will include an emergency stack/vent, damper control to allow hot flue gas to pass out of the system in case of power failure, this preventing damage to the downstream equipment. To ensure the burner operations are safe and sound, the incinerator will be equipped with a burner management system.

Kolkata: Hundreds hopped on to East-West Metro coaches just for the fun of it but for many still, it became a useful means of commute on the first day itself.

The truncated run turned out to be extremely economical for V Agarwal, who, till Thursday, who shelled out Rs 130 to reach his Sector V office from his Kankurgachhi home. On Friday, he paid Rs 6 for an auto ride to Bengal Chemical and then Rs 10 for the 5km Metro ride to Sector V. “From now on, I will only be paying Rs 32 a day for commuting to office,” said this first-day passenger. The thought of saving Rs 220-Rs 230 a day cheered him up.

“But even in its 5km truncated avatar, the new Metro has turned out to be such a handy means of transport,” said scientist and DL Block resident Amit Pal. He took the train from Sector V and travelled till Salt Lake Stadium for Rs 10. He then walked through Subhash Sarovar to reach his destination — Beliaghata ID Hospital. “It’s not possible to go for morning walks when one has to reach the workplace by 9.30am. Not only will I save the money but will also be able to walk to my workplace. The new Metro is changing my commuting habit,” smiled Pal.

People are already ditching cars, overloaded bus and autos to take the comfortable Metro. For months now, Phoolbagan resident Dibyendu Bera, who had to endure three auto rides to reach his office at Shaishali building next to CGO complex. “All this time, I would either look for a bus after an auto ride or split my journey into three auto rides. Today, I took an auto to Kadapara, walked to Salt Lake Stadium and came straight to Central Park station, which is right next to my office,” Bera said happily.

Aniruddha De, who lives near Garia station, too, was celebrating his ‘freedom’ from autos. “I take an AC bus to Beliaghata so that I can board an auto to my office at Bikash Bhavan. Today, I got off near Salt Lake Stadium and came to Karumanoyee Metro station. Life has become so much easier,” the government employee quipped. It was a significant day for De. “I had taken the first-day ride on the north-south Metro with my father. I was a 12-year-old then,” he smiled.

Kolkata: As the first East-West Metro train embarked on a truncated 5km journey between Salt Lake and EM Bypass on Friday, Kolkatans set out in droves — young and old, professionals and college students, friends’ groups and families — on Valentine’s Day to check out the “notun Metro” (new Metro). Sector V to Salt Lake Stadium for Rs 10 was as much an attraction as the excitement for the first day first show of the service.

“We came from Belgachhia just to experience the new Metro service and we enjoyed every bit of it. I parked my bike outside the Sector V station and took a ride on the new train, walking around the spick and span coaches and taking selfies before getting down. That’s how we kick-started Valentine’s Day,” said Abhishek Rajbhar.

Salt Lake resident Suman Chowdhury had promised his kids — son Arkaprabha, 10, and daughter Archita, 13 —several months ago that he would take them on a joyride on the new Metro after it was inaugurated. He kept his word on Friday as the family took the Metro from Karunamoyee to reach Salt Lake Stadium in six minutes.

The Chowdhurys were not the only excited family around. Hundreds others came to check out and post photos — swanky coaches, world-class stations and a ringside view of Salt Lake and EM Bypass — on Facebook. Some stood on the seats and leant on the windows to watch the train go by their homes.

“We had great fun. I even asked my brother to record a video of our family taking the train as we rode past our house at EC Block,” said Joyjit Dey, a resident of EC Block in Salt Lake.

There were also friends’ groups and couples riding the train decked up in Valentine’s Day attire, hopping from one station to another, which they said was a major part of their celebration plans for the day.

“We had plans to have lunch at a City Centre restaurant but prior to that, we decided to take a ride on the newly inaugurated train,” said Abhilasha Dutta.

BHOPAL: Eggs are back on the malnutrition battle menu. Women and child development minister Imarti Devi on Friday said that eggs will be given in mid-day meal to those who want it, and the others will be given fruits to combat malnutrition and provide children with healthy and nutritious food at anganwadis.

“It is not compulsory for all students to eat eggs. Those who eat non-vegetarian food or are fine with having eggs with the permission of their parents can have it. Students, who are vegetarians will be given fruits and vegetables to provide them good nutrients and eradicate malnutrition,” said the minister.

The last time the state government spoke about eggs in mid-day meals for those who want it, there were howls of protest from BJP, with leader of opposition Gopal Bhargava going so far as to say eating non-veg food will turn children into cannibals. The government reiterated that eggs weren’t compulsory and stuck to its plan to introduce eggs in mid-day meals from the next fiscal.

“We will not come under pressure from BJP. Those who want to eat eggs will get it,” Imarti Devi said on Friday, adding that the state government is coming up with several new schemes to improve nutrition and education among children of MP.

“We have started mapping 97,135 anganwadis to identify highly malnourished children who need immediate care and treatment. The C-SAM programme (community-based management of severely acute malnutrition) began on February 11 and will go in till February 20 after which a five-day camp will be held where the children thus identified will be given health check-ups and medicines and provided with nutritious food. There will be regular follow-ups,” the minister said.

More than 80 lakh children will benefit from this scheme, Imarti Devi said. “We will set up 50,076 nutrition awareness stalls and distribute 2.5 lakh ‘poshan baskets’ to children in a year. We will also compile a book with local recipes and dishes that are tasty and healthy, using items available in each part of the state,” she added.

Her department has set up 313 ‘bal shiksha kendras’ and plans to open 800 more such centres this month, where pre-primary students will be given education at par with private schools, the minister said.

Manoj Tiwari

NEW DELHI: In a review meeting on Friday, Delhi BJP identified shortcomings in the organisation and the campaign strategy as two primary reasons behind the party’s poor show in the assembly elections. BJP has managed to bag just eight constituencies in the 70-seat House.

According to initial feedback received during a series of meetings at the Delhi BJP office on Friday, the party erred in handling key issues like freebies given by the AAP government and the anti-Citizenship Amendment Act protests at Shaheen Bagh.

“The remarks of some leaders calling chief minister Arvind Kejriwal a terrorist and slogans like ‘goli maaro’ did not go down well with the people,” said a functionary, claiming that several participants at the meeting expressed this view.

The deliberations were attended by Delhi BJP chief Manoj Tiwari , national general secretaries Arun Singh and Anil Jain, and Delhi BJP organisational secretary Siddharthan, among others. Local-level party workers, who handled key responsibilities at the assembly constituency level, also participated. The review will continue on Saturday.

Many functionaries pointed out that AAP’s freebies had worked well for it while the absence of anything to counter these in the BJP manifesto didn’t favour BJP. “Initially there was suggestions to include subsidies on water, power and transport, and other facilities for the poor in the manifesto, but the final draft didn’t include them, giving AAP an upper hand,” said a source.

The late announcement of candidates was also flagged as a key problem area. It had left many candidates contesting from new areas with less time to connect with voters, the source said. The party also received complaints against workers on the ground. AAP was the first party to release its list of candidates during the campaign.

Some participants alleged that the door-to-door campaigning by the candidates was hampered by the influx of a large number of star campaigners, who had addressed back-to-back public meetings, said the source.

More feedback will be collected from candidates and councillors. The exercise will be completed in the next three-four days and a report will be submitted to the national leadership.

PANAJI: The high court has directed that Rs 10 lakh deposited by two petitioners in court be transferred to the Institute of Public Assistance (Provedoria) to be utilised for building western toilets in old-age homes .

“…the Provedoria, rather than crediting this amount to its general coffers, must consider expending this amount of Rs 10 lakh towards providing sufficient amount of western-style toilets in these old-age homes in case they have not been provided,” Justices Mahesh Sonak and M S Jawalkar stated in their order on Tuesday.

The court noted that there was a grievance raised with regard to insufficient western-style toilets in old-age homes, causing inconvenience to senior citizens, and directed the director of Provedoria to file a report regarding the utilisation of the Rs 10 lakh with the registry by July 31.

Advocate general Devidas Pangam told the court that the Provedoria maintains about 10 old-age homes.

Last month, the court directed two petitioners to deposit Rs 5 lakh each after the court found that they did not participate in a tender process by the directorate of small savings and lotteries despite seeking an interim order from the court in their favour permitting them to participate in the tender process.

Bengaluru: The Karnataka high court on Friday ordered notice to the Commercial Street police on a petition filed by former chief minister HD Kumaraswamy pertaining to a protest held outside the income-tax department’s office in March last year. The senior JD(S) functionary sought quashing of the complaint. However, as the government pleader requested time, Justice BA Patil adjourned hearing to next week.

In his petition, Kumaraswamy said the initiation of a criminal complaint against him is a clear violation of his fundamental right to freedom of speech and expression. He states he and others had assembled peacefully to protest against the illegal and unauthorised raids conducted by the I-T department against JD(S) and Congress functionaries. He said the department was acting on instructions from the Centre.

Kumaraswamy said the allegations are nothing but an abuse of process of law and was filed to curry favour with a particular political party.

Police were acting on a private complaint filed by A Mallikarjuna, a social activist from Gubbi in Tumakuru district, before a special court for elected representatives. The court had directed the Commercial Street police to investigate.

Pune: Had the staffers of the Pune railway division followed two protocols, the life of 26-year-old Sagar Janardan Markad could have been saved.

First, no Railway Protection Force (RPF) personnel were deployed to escort the Mumbai-Latur-Bidar Express train in the Pune division in the early hours of Thursday because of manpower crunch. Second, one of the two loco pilots, who twice went to the crowded compartment in which Sagar was assaulted to check why his wife had pulled the chain, did not report anything to anyone.

When Sagar was being assaulted following a row over sharing a seat, his wife, Jyoti, had pulled the chain thrice. The train had stopped at Hadapsar, Manjari and Loni.

A source confirmed one of the loco pilots of the train went to the coach twice to check why the chain was pulled. Unfortunately, he did not report anything, the source said.

“Had there been any message from the loco pilot or the guard, we would have known. If the chain is pulled, the train stops and the guard or one of the loco pilots has to check why the chain was pulled. The regulations also say that they have to inform the railway control, the travelling ticket examiner (TTE) or the RPF about the reason. However, we didn’t receive any message from the loco pilot,” a source in the Pune railway division told TOI, requesting anonymity.

“Since, the compartment in which the assault occurred was near the engine, it was the responsibility of the loco pilot concerned to check why the chain was pulled,” the source added.

Another source in the railways told TOI that when the train started from Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus (CSMT) and reached Pune station, it had RPF escort. “The escort changes at different divisions. From Pune, ideally, the Pune RPF had to provide escort until Daund. But that was not the case,” he said.

“The Pune RPF provides escort to only 35 trains because of manpower issues. These trains are selected based on prevalence of criminal incidents and this train was not on the list,” the source added.

Manoj Jhawar, the public relations officer of the Pune division, said, “The Government Railway Police is probing the case. If they need any help from us, it will be provided to them.”

344,['15/02/2020'],Top officials call on Amarinder to allay NPR fears,"This story is from February 15, 2020

NEW DELHI: In an outreach to states that have expressed reservations against the proposed updation of National Population Register (NPR), the registrar general of India and census commissioner is likely to visit these states in the coming days and meet their chief ministers or senior representatives to personally allay their concerns.

A start was made by RGI and census commissioner Vivek Joshi who met Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh on Friday to apprise him of the houselisting phase of Census 2021 as well as NPR updation proposed to be done simultaneously between April and September this year. Sources indicated that Joshi may soon visit other states opposing NPR or those seeking modifications in the NPR form to drop the new questions relating to date and place of parents’ birth as well as mother tongue.

Some of the states that Joshi may visit are Kerala, West Bengal, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh. During each of these visits, he will try to reach out to the chief ministers or senior state representatives to explain the legal position regarding NPR; utility of the exercise for formulation and targeting of state-specific welfare schemes; how sharing data on NPR fields is voluntary for the respondent who does not need to show any documents; and that no NRC is planned as of now.

While Kerala has decided that it will skip NPR exercise but cooperate with conduct of census, West Bengal has put the NPR exercise on hold. Congress-ruled states like Punjab, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh have objected to the new questions on date and birth of parents. Even Odisha and Bihar have suggested that these questions be dropped from NPR form.

Sources said that while NPR manual and draft form have been finalised, these are yet to be printed. The format will be forwarded to the states around mid-March and printing the NPR form will be the states’ responsibility. The form — which does not need to be notified — has 23 fields of information, an undertaking that the information declared is true to the best of belief and knowledge of respondent, as well as disclaimer that nationality as declared will not confer any right to Indian citizenship. However, the penalty clause for giving false information may not figure in the new form.

There is apprehension within the government that some of the controversial fields of information being sought for the first time in NPR 2020 may be returned as blank by a large number of residents, especially in states like West Bengal. Also, the states may advise enumerators not to seek information on these fields in the interest of their safety. There is also an underlying fear that NPR controversy may affect the census exercise, with many residents refusing to properly answer census questionnaire. This will adversely affect accuracy of census data, said an officer.

Jaisalmer: During winters, a large number of migratory birds land in desert areas which attracts many bird watchers to Jaisalmer .

The Desert National Park (DNP) had organised a bird fair and conducted an avian census in Jaisalmer whose data was released recently. It was found that hundreds of birds of 36 varieties flock the 13 ponds in the district.

A total of 1,545 birds of 36 varieties were found and according to bird lovers, the number is quite good. More birds can be seen at other ponds in the district. During winters, a large number of migratory birds flock Jaisalmer and after winters they go back to their original place.

DNP deputy conservator of forest Kapil Chandrawal said the census of birds was done on January 25 at Gadisar lake, Gajrup Sagar lake, Shivlotra Nadi, Mawa Talab, Netsi pond, Kavadisar and Jethwai pond in the district by the forest department.

He said demoiselle crane, red-wattled lapwing, black-winged stilt, common coot, northern shoveler, common sandpiper, gadwall, yellow-wattled lapwing, common teal, little grebe, cattle egret, common moorhen, little egret, Indian pond-heron, little stint, little ringed plover, garganey, Indian spot-billed duck, red-naped ibis and many others were found by the authorities.

He said Jaisalmer has established itself on the world tourism map and efforts will be made to showcase the district as a haven for migratory birds so that tourists coming to Jaisalmer can find a new attraction.

Colva: A trip to the beach for most foreign tourists involves swimming and sunbathing. But for Nicky, a visitor from Belgium, it is an opportunity to clean the shore.

Armed with a metal detector and a backpack, he catches the attention of many as he glides the device over the sand at Benaulim beach for two hours each morning to search for discarded bottle caps, nails and screws, while also picking up plastic trash along the way.

The objective is two-pronged — he not only wants to make the coastline cleaner but also seeks to sensitise people to keep it that way. “India is a wonderful country, specially its tourist states like Goa. People here depend on tourism, but gradually, tourists will stay away because of dirty surroundings,” Nicky tells TOI as he displays a bagful of trash that he’s collected in just 30 minutes. “The internet, magazines and newspapers worldwide are full of articles about how dirty the planet is. Yet, people still throw plastic bottles into the sea with gay abandon,” he says.

Nicky’s tryst with cleaning Goa’s beaches began two years ago, when he set out on a similar mission at Agonda. “Hundreds of people stop and ask me what I am doing. I tell them that I’m helping them understand that they have to respect their land. May be they will stop littering the beach, land and water and may be they will start cleaning the planet in their own way, someday,” he says.

The Belgian suggests a ban on screw-top bottles — like the one being implemented in European nations — if the state’s authorities are keen on reducing waste on beaches and littering in general. “The cap should ideally remain on the bottle and just a small, pop-up opening should be allowed. If this is followed, there will be a drastic decline in littering,” he says.

The budget session will precede a joint session of the legislature beginning Monday (February 17). Five of the bills pertain to amendments to existing acts — including the one to the Lokayukta Act — while the other is a new bill.

Incidentally, the recommendation to amend the Act came from Lokayukta Justice P Vishwanath Shetty way back in 2018. It was cleared by the previous coalition government cabinet to be tabled as an amendment to the original act.

The proposed amendment comes in the wake of a number of serious allegations against a former Lokayukta, which raised concerns about independent and impartial inquiry into cases surrounding him or her.

The 2015 scandal surrounding former Lokayukta Justice Bhaskar Rao ’s son in an extortion case involving the quasi-judicial body had embarrassed the state and eroded the credibility of the anti-corruption body.

The government will also table a fresh bill to constitute a Karnataka Innovation Authority for the purpose of assisting startups and setup regulating sandboxes.

Kageri said the legislature session will be divided into two parts — a four-day joint session (from February 17 to February 20) during which governor Vajubhai Vala will deliver his address and a lengthy budget session from March 2 to March 31.

“Besides two days of discussion on the governor’s address, two days will also be set aside for discussion and deliberation on the Constitution of India on March 2 and 3,” Kageri said.

349,['15/02/2020'],Nayana Gunde to continue as PMPML’s chairperson-cum-managing director,"This story is from February 15, 2020

Pune: Nayana Gunde will continue as the chairperson-cum-managing director of the Pune Mahanagar Parivahan Mahamandal Limited (PMPML) with the state government cancelling the appointment of former Raigad collector Vijay Suryavanshi to the post.

He has now been appointed municipal commissioner of the Kalyan-Dombivli Municipal Corporation. The change was announced on Thursday with sources telling TOI that Gunde’s appointment to the Tribal Research and Training Institute had been cancelled.

“On January 17, the state government had transferred Gunde and Suryavanshi was made the PMPML’s new head. However, he proceeded on leave. It seems that he was not keen on joining his new posting. Gunde, meanwhile, continued to hold the post as she couldn’t join the tribal institute before handing over the charge of PMPML,” the source said.

Suryavanshi is a 2006 batch IAS officer, while Gunde belongs to the 2008 batch. She has been holding the position of PMPML chief since February 2018. Now with the fresh development, Gunde could be among a very few officers who have held the position for two or more years. “Since 2007, the PMPML has had 16 CMDs. Most of them held the post for a year or less before they were transferred. Only R N Joshi remained in the position for close to four years after his appointment in 2011. Gunde’s predecessor Tukaram Mundhe was transferred after 10 months,” another official said.

Sujit Patwardhan of Parisar, a Pune-based NGO, which deals with transport-related issues, said, “It is shocking that the new chief has not joined office. However, it is good that the existing chief will continue in the same post. Gunde has got a hang of the things now, and it is time to deliver and boost the ailing transport body,” he said.

PUNE: Special UAPA judge S R Navander on Friday allowed the National Investigation Agency’s plea for moving the Elgar Parishad case records, seized properties and proceedings to the special NIA court in Mumbai.“The investigation has been handed over to the NIA (National Investigation Agency). This court has to abide by the provisions of the NIA Act,” judge Navander said.He observed, “Having regard to the aim and objective of the NIA Act, the order of investigation through NIA cannot be said to be illegal or improper, nor the order has been challenged or set aside.”The judge held, “When investigation is carried out by the NIA, only the special court established as per Section 11 of the NIA Act has the jurisdiction to try the case.”“The special NIA court at Mumbai has jurisdiction over entire states of Maharashtra and Gujarat. Therefore, it can be said that the special court at Mumbai is also the court of local jurisdiction of this case. As such, it becomes clear that this (Pune) court is left with no jurisdiction to deal with the case and it falls in the jurisdiction of special NIA court, Mumbai,” the judge added.On the argument that the Pune court on its own had no powers to transfer the case, the judge held, “This court was having jurisdiction till the (central government’s) order under Section 6 (5) of the NIA Act was passed and NIA took up the investigation. As soon as NIA stepped in, the jurisdiction of this court stands ousted. In such situation, the case has to be moved over to the court which has jurisdiction i.e. special NIA court, Mumbai. In the eyes of law, it is not a transfer of case, but sending of the same to proper court due to lack of jurisdiction.”On the state having constituted a special NIA court in Pune under Section 22 of the NIA Act and the same should have jurisdiction to try and decide the case, judge Navander held that such special courts were only empowered to deal with cases investigated by a state agency and Section 22 of the Act was specific on this count.The judge held that Section 13 of the NIA Act empowered the central government to constitute special courts for trying scheduled offences under the Act and only such courts could entertain the matter. The only recourse I have is to send the case records to the appropriate court. I cannot hold it and, therefore, the matter is being sent to the court in Mumbai,” the judge said. “It is in the interest of everyone,” he added.The judge pointed out that the Pune police’s investigating officer (ACP Shivaji Pawar) had filed a report that the case records and seized properties were being handed over to the NIA as per the consent given by the state government.The court directed that all the nine activists arrested so far in the case be produced before the NIA court in Mumbai for the next hearing on February 28.The development means that all further investigation into the case, fresh arrests and filing of supplementary chargesheet(s) would be done by the NIA before the special court in Mumbai and the trial, too, would be held there.The Pune court requested the NIA to make arrangements for the transportation of the case records and seized properties to Mumbai, and to coordinate with the state director-general of prisons for the transfer of the arrested activists from Pune’s Yerawada central prison to one of the jails in Mumbai.",pune,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74146485,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-155278,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/judge-allows-nia-plea-to-shift-elgar-case-records/articleshow/74143231.cms

BHOPAL: The coronavirus epidemic is giving sleepless nights to Chinese Army veteran Wang Qi, who had come to visit his family in Balaghat, Madhya Pradesh. His multi-entry visa expires on February 29 but with flights to China uncertain, he fears he may be arrested for visa violation.Wang Qi, who returned to his homeland after spending 54 years in India, frequently comes to Balaghat where his family lives. His son Vishnu Wang said he has been very anxious ever since the coronavirus epidemic broke out. “Father fears being arrested by local police for visa violation if he has to continue to stay in India because of coronavirus. I am writing to the embassy for help,” said Vishnu.The former PLA soldier has faced several problems even after he reached China, says his family. He was asked by Beijing to produce proof of the alleged ‘torture’ he faced during his ‘exile’ in this country. Wang Qi was even put on ‘truth test’ after four of his platoon mates, who were suspended, reportedly objected to financial benefits the Chinese government is likely to provide. “My father’s troubles are far from over. Now, this coronavirus is the latest,” said Vishnu.Wang Qi was also expecting retirement benefits from Chinese Army, but they are on hold as he was declared ‘dead’ in official records, said sources. To clear his record, PLA has ordered an inquiry into his “disappearance from duty” in January 1963, two months after the India-China War ended, and the circumstances under which he was considered dead, said sources.Wang Qi was arrested by Indian Army on January 3, 1963. He said he was a mechanical survey engineer and inadvertently crossed the border. Since the war was over, he was treated as a spy and not accorded POW status. After being moved from one jail to another for eight years, he was freed and settled in Tirodi village, Balaghat, under an Indian name Raj Bahahdur. He married and had children but always yearned to return home. After struggling for years, Wang and his family finally visited China on February 10 last year and were given a grand welcome in Xiaozhainan, where his elder brother lives. His return to China hit front-pages in Chinese media even as the government tried to cash in on the situation by showcasing how they got one of their lost citizens after much effort.",bhopal,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74147432,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-531621,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/wang-qi-fears-coronavirus-may-land-him-in-jail-again/articleshow/74142419.cms

Hyderabad: Apps, social networking sites, and teachers on call are coming in handy for students preparing for their board examinations. A majority of the schools in the city, especially those affiliated to the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) or Council for the Indian School Certificate Examination (CISCE), are using technology to help students prepare better for the examinations.

“Each teacher has created a WhatsApp group and it is used to clear doubts and send instructions or tips,” said Sunitha Rao, principal, Delhi Public School, Nacharam, adding that as soon as a student posts a query, either peers or teachers clear the doubt immediately.

She said that besides asking students to call teachers directly if they are stuck with a topic, teachers too are advised to call and find out the progress of students, especially the ones who are weak or are lagging behind. “A teacher will be on call for an hour everyday and their timings are circulated at the beginning of the academic year. However, students appearing for the board examinations generally don’t follow these timings, but are encouraged to call teachers at any time,” added Rao. She said that even psychologists or student counsellors are available on call for the students and their parents.

Besides clearing doubts and sending instructions, schools are also using technology to send important learning material and organise video conferences. Some are even allowing students to take pre-board examinations from the comfort of their homes. “Many parents do not want their children to waste time commuting. So, we are allowing students to take exams from home. All they have to do is download the question paper from our app, write answers, and scan the papers and send them to us so that teachers can evaluate the answers,” said Simi Nagi, principal, Pallavi Model School.

Thrissur: For the first time in the state a government hospital has set up a cloth bank to provide clothes for patients.

The new project was set up by Pudukad Taluk Hospital in Thrissur and was implemented by its staff council.

Pudukad Taluk Hospital health inspector P N Vidyadaran, told TOI, “The taluk hospital is situated near the national highway and five to six accident cases are reported daily in the region. Most accident patients and bystanders come in with bloodstained clothes. We can’t provide treatment or shift them to Medical College hospital without a change in clothes. Last month the staff council members collected money and set up a cloth bank.”

“Now the cloth bank has clothes for 5-year-olds to 80-year-olds. After hearing about the initiative many were ready to donate clothes, he added.

“Most patients are unaware of the need for new clothes when they come to the hospital. Some seniors reach the hospital with their clothes in a soiled state and we can’t provide treatment without a change of clothes. We will provide new clothes to the patients and bystanders in need. A staff nurse of the hospital Shela, was behind the idea,” he said.

Taluk hospital superintendent Dr Binoj Mathew inaugurated the second phase of the project last week. Staff council president Dr Jesna Muhammed and P N Vidayadaran led the cloth bank initiative.

In addition, the staff council of the hospital adopted the kids ward of the taluk hospital and completed the renovation work with the fund of staff council. “In the new kids ward we set up facilities for playing,” said the health inspector.

Picture used for representational purpose only

NEW DELHI: The race for becoming the leader of Opposition in Delhi assembly has started in BJP while Aam Aadmi Party is preparing to form the next government with the swearing-in ceremony of chief minister designate Arvind Kejriwal scheduled on Sunday. BJP won eight seats in the 70-member Delhi assembly where AAP got 62 in yet another landslide victory in the Delhi assembly elections, the results of which were declared on Tuesday.

In the sixth Delhi assembly, BJP only had three MLAs. Though the saffron party did not qualify for getting the position of the leader of Opposition — at least 10% of the total members of the House are required to be able to get the position —AAP had given the status of the leader of Opposition to BJP. This time, BJP has the numbers.

Frontrunners for the post include Rohini MLA Vijender Gupta, who was the leader of Opposition in the previous assembly, Badarpur MLA Ramvir Singh Bidhuri and Karawal Nagar MLA Mohan Singh Bisht, according to sources in BJP. The newly elected MLAs have started meeting senior BJP leaders as the decision about appointing the leader of Opposition is likely to be taken soon.

Apart from the three, the party can also nominate a fresh face from among the remaining MLAs. The Kejriwal cabinet may convene the assembly next week for oath of newly elected MLAs where the election of speaker of the House will take place.

356,['15/02/2020'],Leakages in pipe at Shinganapur major concern ahead of summer,"This story is from February 15, 2020

Kolhapur: The persistent leakages at the Shinganapur barrage, which is a key water supply point for the city, are giving sleepless mights to the civic officials. Over 50% of water is lost through leakages.

At the barrage, the water level of Panchganga river should be 535.3 meters. Only then, all the pumps of total capacity 86 million litres a day can run to their full capacity.

However, the drop in water level in the dams during summer is expected to reduce the level at the barrage too and affect the supply. The leakages in the barrage are only going to worsen the situation, citizens said.

The Kolhapur Municipal Corporation (KMC) had invited tenders to carry out the repair work of the barrage eight times; however, it has not received any bidders. The KMC has set aside Rs 40 lakh for the work.

KMC’s deputy hydraulic engineer Ramdas Gaikwad said, “The work is risky as there is continuous flow of water. We tried to get it repaired, however, the exercise turned out to be futile. The material gets washed away immediately. There is need to stop the water flow and then carry out the work.”

He added that there is a need for a copper dam to carry out the work and they had requested the water supply department to provide the expertise to initiate the task.

The irrigation department has asked the civic administration to get the barrage repaired and this time they have set the deadline May to complete the task.

The irrigation department releases water at a rate of 400 to 700 cusecs after every ten days. This lasts for about four to six days. The water released from the dams in summer gets used upstreams for irrigating farms.

A senior official of water resources department requesting anonymity said, “We are requested to release the water from the dams by the KMC. We have to ensure that adequate stock level is maintained in dams especially for irrigation. We have been verbally asked by some officials for help but no formal proposal to get us involved in the repair work has been made.”

Several complaints were made about the quality of the Shingnapur scheme. The barrage was constructed in 1998. There are 20 columns of the barrage out which leakage is taking place from two columns. The officials claim that if the two columns are not replaced, then further damage to other columns will start.

Bhopal: The court of district & sessions judge, here, has asked the CBI to ensure presence of Union Carbide of India Ltd (UCIL) officials convicted in the Bhopal gas disaster criminal case, to attend the court proceedings.

During Friday’s hearing, the court asked the CBI counsel about the whereabouts of the only local accused in the case, Shakeel Qureshi, who is missing for quite some time. At the previous hearing, the court had asked the CBI to find out Qureshi’s whereabouts and present him in court during the next hearing.

On Friday, district & sessions judge, Rajendra Kumar Verma, not only asked about Shakeel Qureshi, but also asked the CBI why other convicts in the case don’t come to court on hearings in the case. When the CBI counsel said one or two of the convicts in the case – Keshav Mahindra are too old to appear before the court and another convict is suffering from cancer, the judge said, “At least those who can come should be present in the court during hearing”.

He also asked for the presence of SP, CBI, on the next date of hearing to brief the court on Shakeel Qureshi’s mysterious disappearance and the investigating agency’s attempts to trace him.

Earlier, arguing on behalf of Keshav Mahindra, who was chairman of UCIL at the time of Bhopal gas tragedy, senior counsel from Mumbai, Amit Desai, said the CBI has not been able to produce any evidence so far indicating that Mahindra had knowledge that the Carbide plant in Bhopal was dangerous. He stressed that Mahindra was a non-executive chairman of the company and had no role in the plant’s day-to-day functioning.

He cited several Supreme Court rulings which held that a non-executive director of a company is not responsible for the company’s day-to-day functioning and he may or may not have complete knowledge about the company or the plant it operates.

On the next date of hearing, i.e. February 26 and 27, defence arguments for convicted Union Carbide officials would wrap up and counsel for the prosecuting agency would commence his arguments.

One of the axed sandalwood trees

PUNE: Thieves chopped and stole two sandalwood trees from the NIBM campus at Kondhwa early on Thursday.

The theft occured mere hours after a function, attended by President Ram Nath Kovind, concluded on the institute’s premises on Wednesday.

The National Institute of Bank Management’s (NIBM) estate and security manager, Shyam Sunder Lilani (59), lodged an FIR with the Kondhwa police against two men soon after campus security notified him about the theft.

Assistant inspector Chetan More of the Kondhwa police said, “Investigations revealed that the thieves bent the barbed-wire fence of a housing society on NIBM-Undri Road and sneaked into the NIBM campus. They axed and stole logs of two sandalwood trees and took to their heels after the security guards on patrol spotted them.”

“The thieves climbed the wire fence and fled barefoot with the logs in their hands in the direction of NIBM Chowk and Cloud9, which is a gated housing society on NIBM annexe road,” More said.

“The complainant and the security guards on duty were not able to describe the thieves. The CCTV cameras on campus do not cover the incident spot. We are working on certain clues and hope to solve the case at the earliest,” he added.

NIBM director KL Dhingra, in response to a text message sent by TOI, said, “Sandalwood thieves entered the NIBM campus on February 13 around 2.30am by breaking open the barbed wire fence. While they were cutting the trees, the guards heard noises and rushed to capture them but they fled with the middle portion of the two trees. They left behind the instrument that they used to chop the trees, besides a slipper. The matter was immediately reported to the senior police inspector of the Kondhwa police and an FIR was lodged.”

Nagpur: What will you do if you are deserted on an island with completely unknown individuals, and one after the other dies? Scary, isn’t it?

Play ‘DusTak’, staged by Insignia Productions in association with Hislop Centre for Performing Arts (HCPA) and Chitnavis Centre, at Banyan Hall on Friday, really made the audience panicky.

The play, produced by Rahuldev Mukherji, was directed by Arkdev Bhattacharyya.

The play was a Hindi adaptation of Agatha Christie’s best-selling novel ‘And Then There Were None’.

Ten people, all strangers to each other, are invited to Indian Island. The actors were Anil Kumar Saxena (Roger Stephen), Parvati Patil (Annie Jacob), her husband Manohar (Aniket Jadhav), Shalini Singh (Lipika Choudhary), Justice Siddheshwar Bose (Supantha Bhattacharya), Shakti Kaul (Vivek Thaware), Vidya Sinha (Meghna Mulchandani), Dr Varun Prabhakar (Yash Borokar) and colonel Badal Gupta (Padmanabhan Pillai).

When they arrive on the island, the guests are greeted by Mr and Mrs Patil, the butler and housekeeper, who report that the host, someone they call ‘Mr Jain’, will not arrive until the next day.

As the guests gather after dinner, they hear a recorded voice accusing each of them of a murders committed by them in the past and never uncovered. They compare notes and realize that none of them, including the servants, knows ‘Mr Jain’, suggesting they were brought according to a plan.

As they discuss what to do, Saxena chokes on poisoned whiskey and dies. Frightened, the party retreats to bed where almost everyone is plagued by guilt and memories of their crimes.

The next morning, the guests find that Mrs Patil apparently died in sleep. The frightened guests decide to leave the island but the boat does not come.

Meanwhile, Gupta feels sure he is going to die. The next moment, he is found lying dead on the terrace. Everyone starts doubting each other.

The remaining guests meet to discuss their situation. They decide that one of them must be the killer. Many make vague accusations, but Bose reminds them that the existing evidence suggests any of them could be a killer.

The next morning, they find Mr Patil killed while chopping wood for making breakfast. The guests feel the murders are being carried out according to the dictates of the nursery rhyme ‘Ten little Indians’. They realize that the dining room table initially featured ten Indian figures. But with each death, one of it disappears.

After breakfast, Shalini feels slightly giddy and found dead with her neck slit. Bose initiates search for everyone’s belongings for a possible weapon. Others cast suspicious looks at each other. Finally, Vidya goes to take a bath but she is startled by a piece of seaweed hanging from her ceiling.

The remaining run to help her only to return downstairs to find Bose shot in the head.

NEW DELHI: A day after a 28-year-old man was arrested for the murder of five members of a family in Bhajanpura, police cremated their bodies as their relatives did not have enough money to take the bodies back home to their village in Bihar. Meanwhile, police have taken the killer, Prabhunath, into custody to find out whether he was aided by someone.

During questioning, Prabhunath said that he had first murdered his cousin Shambhu in his room and kept waiting for his wife to return from the kitchen. As soon as she entered the room, he hit her with an iron rod on her head due, to which she fell unconscious. He then hit her a few more time to ensure that she died. However, Shambhu’s daughter Komal saw Prabhunath bludgeoning her mother and tried to raise an alarm and alert her brothers, but Prabhunath gagged her and then throttled her. He left the body near the second room where Shambhu’s sons were asleep. He then hit them with the iron rod multiple times.

Officers probing the case, however, were suspicious of his narrative and probing whether someone else had helped him in overpowering the family, since it would be difficult for a single person to attack and kill five people without others coming to know about it. He would be taken to the crime scene to recreate the sequence. The autopsy was conducted by a panel of three doctors.

364,['15/02/2020'],Only 39% water tax collected,"This story is from February 15, 2020

Kolhapur: The Kolhapur Municipal Corporation (KMC) is able to collect only 39% of its targeted revenue through water tax. As a result, this month, the salaries of the entire staff of the water supply department was stopped till Thursday owing to poor tax collection.

Over 134 million litres of water is lifted from various schemes, however, bills for water usage of only 54.6 million litres are collected.

Prashant Pandat, chief water tax superintendent of KMC, said, “We need to reform the system of water supply. It is often perceived that the system is working for profit. In reality, we are even unable to recover the expenses to run the system.”

“We have to convince to the citizens to pay the water tax dues regularly. We have found that while they pay their electricity bills, mobile and cable recharges regularly, but are reluctant to pay water tax bills. The attitude must change,” he added.

The KMC has set aside budget of Rs 22 crore for electricity bills for the power used for pumping and treating water. This year, most of the funds have already been spent two months before the end of the financial year.

Ramdas Gaikwad, deputy hydraulic engineer at Kolhapur Municipal Corporation, said, “This year, the work of the Kalammawadi dam project will be completed and we won’t have to rely on the old pumping stations. There will be less expenditure and adequate water supply.”

Hyderabad: “Don’t look at peers, focus on yourself,” is the advice of Commissioner of Collegiate Education and IAS officer Navin Mittal to students, who are set to appear for the board examinations.

He said that many might just show off by saying that they have already covered the entire syllabus, but one should not get demotivated by such claims. “In my experience, I have seen that people who show off might not get better results,” said Mittal. “Do not look at others and worry. This is between you and the exam, what others do should not force you to change the way you are preparing for the exam.”

Mittal said that as the exams are just a few days away, it is best to stick to the basics and focus on revision. “There is no point in running after too much material. Just refer to your notes or material and concentrate on the basics. For subjects like Physics, Chemistry or Mathematics, concentrate on problem-solving,” he advised and asked them to focus on exams and stop worrying about the result.

He added that students should avoid unnecessary distraction and stress as this will only harm their preparation. “Parents must not add to their stress. Instead, they should support and motivate their wards.”

366,['15/02/2020'],Minister’s U-turn after remark on agri loan waiver sparks controversy,"This story is from February 15, 2020

GAD minister Govind Singh

BHOPAL: Madhya Pradesh general administration department (GAD) minister Govind Singh stunned his party leaders when he admitted that the Congress-led government has failed to fulfil Rahul Gandhi’s promise of waiving farm loans in 10 days if the party came to power. The debts left behind by the former BJP government were to blame, he said.

“Rahul Gandhi ji had announced waiver of farm loans up to Rs 2 lakh in 10 days if Congress forms the government in Madhya Pradesh. But we failed to keep that promise. Opposition leaders allege that Congress ‘betrayed farmers’, but I would like to point out that the state's financial condition is terrible, hence the delay in waiving the entire loan as announced,” Singh said at a district-level meeting on ‘Jai Kisan Rin Mafi Yojana’ in Mehgaon village of Bhind district, 500km from Bhopal , on Thursday.

On Friday evening, however, he made a U-turn. “It’s 1000% false that I said we could not fulfil loan waiver promise. In fact, we are continuously doing this. The government is writing off farm loans in instalments. The ministers are monitoring the process in each district,” said Singh despite their being a video of his Bhind speech.

The minister, said to be loyal to the Digvijaya Singh-Ajay Singh faction in Madhya Pradesh Congress, is known for being outspoken. In December 2019, he had acknowledged that the government had not been able to keep the agri loan waiver promise, but assured that it would do so. A month before this, AICC general secretary Jyotiraditya Scindia had said that the government hadn’t been able to keep the farm loan waiver promise “in entirety”.

On Friday, Singh said blamed the financial burdens and empty coffers left behind by the erstwhile BJP government for the delay. “The then chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan had drawn huge debts. During Digvijaya Singh ’s Congress regime, the state had only Rs 5,500 crore as debt, which was drawn for development work. But Shivraj Singh Chouhan left Rs 1.87 lakh crore on the state’s debt accounts. Moreover, Rs 13,000 crore dues to contractors, for so-called-development works, turned out to be another big liability for the incumbent Congress government,” Singh said in Bhind.

“The previous BJP regime also did not clear Rs 16,500 crore-Rs 17,000 crore debt on the power subsidy scheme Sambal, which turned out to be the biggest farce. The state’s coffers were empty, still the BJP government announced subsidy in Sambal scheme. The government could not pay huge debts which resulted in another big liability for the Congress government,” said Singh.

The BJP hit out at Congress, saying Singh’s statement is evidence that the government “betrayed farmers”. “We respect Govind Singh for coming clear on Congress’ biggest fiasco, which they claimed was a game-changer during the 2018 assembly elections. BJP has been raising this issue since the formation of Congress government. Now, it’s up to Congress to decide if they should follow Rahul’s announcement and ask CM Kamal Nath to resign, or cheat public again,” Leader of Opposition Gopal Bhargava told TOI.

“Congress was aware of the financial situation of Madhya Pradesh during BJP rule, still they made fake promises of waiving farm loans and did not keep it. Congress will lose credibility among the public for this failure,” added Bhargava.

The state Congress said that debts of 21 lakh farmers have already been waived in the first instalment, and the second phase is underway. “Minister Singh spoke about the heavy debt and empty coffers left by the previous BJP government and it is true,” said Congress state spokesperson Bhupendra Gupta.

The court has also sought to know the steps taken by the state government for the rehabilitation of the drug addicts terming it to be a mandatory requirement as per the provisions of the NDPS Act and rules under it.

Registering the petition as a PIL under the title of “Illicit Drug Trade-The Rising Menace”, the division bench of Justice Vijay Bishnoi and Justice Sandeep Mehta has also directed the principal secretary (Home) and the DGP to file affidavits in this regard on the next date of hearing.

The court observed that huge recoveries of narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances, especially in medicinal forms, suggested that dealers of these illicit drugs are indulging in nefarious activities which have been affecting the labourers, the students and the young children all alike without any distinction.

The court observed “while hearing the bail applications and other similar matters, we have come to know about huge recoveries of medicinal tablets and cough syrups having narcotic and psychotropic contents and such instances are unabated”.

It may be noted that the commissionerate police of Jodhpur had seized a huge consignment of psychotropic medicines from a chemist of the city on February 2 and had arrested three persons, including the owner.

Kozhikode: The Peruvannamuzhi Dam site , which is part of the one of the two dams in Kozhikode will soon get a makeover. A tourism development and amenity improvement project submitted by the tourism department for the development of the destination has received administrative nod.

The Peruvannamuzhi Dam beautification project has received nod for Rs 3 crore works at the dam site. The initiative is to develop the destination modelled on the Malampuzha Dam site.

A detailed estimate for the project will be prepared soon by the nodal agency, entrusted for carrying out the work, said Beena Madhusoodhanan, secretary of District Tourism Promotion Council. We hope to get technical and financial sanction for the project at the earliest, she said.

The Kerala Irrigation Infrastructure Development Corporation is the nodal agency for carrying out the work. The project includes 10 different works for the development of the site.

A significant proposal is the construction of parking zone at Peruvannamuzhi, said the DTPC secretary. Absence of proper parking facility is a major shortcoming of Peruvannamuzhi and we hope to address this soon, she said.

Apart from parking centre, the work of a children’s park, cafeteria, new entrance, walkway and other amenities will also come up at Peruvannamuzhi as part of the initiative. The overall beautification of the destination in Chakkittapara grama panchayat is proposed in the DPR prepared by the DTPC.

A Tourism Information Centre will also come up at Peruvannamuzhi under the project. The centre will provide information about Peruvannamuzhi and nearby destinations. The details of other destinations in the district will also be made available at the centre.

An interpretation hall to help students and researchers to learn more about Peruvannamuzhi destination is also planned under the project.

The development of Peruvannamuzhi is expected to give boost to the tourism sector between the two dams Kakkayam and Peruvannamuzhi. While Kakkayam dam, under the KSEB is already a major destination with boating facility, children’s park and other amenities, Peruvannamuzhi dam site, under irrigation department, has been lagging behind in development owing to various reasons.

Many already sought-after destinations including Thonikkadavu, Karayathumpara, also falls in the tourism zone. The Thonikkadavu destination was recently developed by the DTPC.

369,['15/02/2020'],Biggest ward gets least supply due to high losses,"This story is from February 15, 2020

Kolhapur: Shailaja Bhosale, who lives in Rajendranagar, is awake every day till midnight just to store water. Thousands like her who live in the E ward, the largest and most populous ward in the city, struggle every day as their area gets just 30% of its required water supply.

“Ours is area located at the fag end of the scheme that bring provides water from Kalamba lake. Water supply, whatever little we get, is late and often starts at midnight. We are told that water is withdrawn mid way and there is very little amount left for us,” she said.

The E ward, which makes up the northern and eastern parts of the city, has a requirement of around 70 million litres of water per day (MLD). However, every day, just 20.90 million litres of water reaches the ward. This is because the large distance between the pumping stations and the residential areas and the leakages along the route, said an official.

While most other parts of the city receive water twice a day for an average of two hours every time. Most of the areas from E ward such as Shahu Market Area, Temblaiwadi, Shivaji University, Uchgaon road area and some parts of Jadhavwadi receive water for just half an hour a day.

Ironically, the ward is flanked by the mighty Panchganga river that had inundated the city for nearly two weeks during the monsoon season last year. The flowing river in their vicinity is of little direct use of the residents because of water pollution. The Kolhapur Municipal Corporation lifts water from the upper streams of the river where it is pure.

KMC’s chief hydraulic engineer B M Kumbhar said the E ward receives water from Shinganapur scheme, which was commissioned twenty years ago. “The scheme was designed to meet the requirements of the residents of E ward till 2011. Thereafter, the pumps needed to be changed as even their discharge capacity has reached its limit. Actually, the entire water supply system needs to be overhauled,” he said.

Many places in E ward do not receive water and the citizens lean on private bore wells to take them through the dry days. The two elevated reservoirs in the E ward have never been used.

As per the norms, the water pressure should be such that supply takes place through taps that are three feet above ground level. However, citizens have to use electric motors to lift water.

Pranil Maniyar, resident of Ruikar Colony, said they receive water from 4am to 8am. “The supply is at very low pressure. Water has to be pumped with the help of electric motors even to reach up to first floor,” she said.

Also, the number of water connections to the main pipeline passing from Shingnapur scheme is increasing. At present, the E ward has 36,139 metered connections, while according to a primary estimate of the officials, the number of illegal connections is over 5,000.

Corporator Satyajeet Kadam of Tararani Aghadi said, “The Shingnapur scheme was developed exclusively to supply water to E ward. However, the water is withdrawn from the pipes before it reaches the localities in E ward. The water supply network is grappling with several issues.”

371,['15/02/2020'],Deo Nagar residents take on NMC over road dug up 10 months ago,"This story is from February 15, 2020

Nagpur: The residents of Deo Nagar recently held a protest against Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) authorities over the condition of a road which was dug up ten months ago and kept as it is.

Recently, the tarring of road was completely removed under the pretext of laying a cement road, and loose gravel was laid on it. Thereafter, the civic contractors disappeared from the spot for over a week, thus putting the residents in lurch. In the meantime, many senior citizens, women and children skidded while driving their vehicles due to lose gravel and sustained injuries.

When residents contacted contractors, they cited that they were yet to receive cement from the NMC. They also blamed MSEDCL authorities for failure to lay cable that led to inordinate delay of ten months. Despite several complaints to the civic officials from Laxmi Nagar, the road was not repaired.

Interestingly, the area comes under mayor Sandip Joshi’s jurisdiction and even he was apprised of the situation. However, when local BJP activists came to know about the complaint, they allegedly tried to intimidate the complainants stating that no work took place during the previous Congress regime for all these years and only due to their leaders, at least some work was happening and therefore, they should keep patience.

The residents then approached Congress activists from the area with their plight. The Congress workers took them to NMC office at Laxmi Nagar under water tank and staged protests there. They also raised slogans against the civic authorities for putting the citizen’s life in danger by not repairing roads. They submitted a memorandum to the civic officials while warning them to intensify the protests, if no steps were taken immediately.

Admitting the inordinate delay, NMC’s assistant commissioner for Laxmi Nagar Zone Rajesh Bhivgade, stated that the delay was caused as MSEDCL didn’t installed their underground cables and also storm water drains wasn’t completed. “Now, we’ve completed 300 metres of cement road’s first layer and work is in full swing. We plan to complete it as soon as possible,” he assured.

According to the residents, several pits dug on the road were left unattended. “Moreover, holes were dug for installing MSEDCL’s cables, but were not filled up properly. The sand that was supposed to be used for constructing roads is left as it is, which not only blocked the regular traffic, but also led to many vehicles skidding,” they said.

When informed on Bhivgade’s statement, the residents claimed that the NMC officials swung into action only after their protests and lodging a complaint with new NMC commissioner Tukaram Mundhe, who had directed his subordinates to look into the issue.

“During rains, we faced numerous problems due to incomplete road work as rainwater used to collect in the pits. It led to mosquito menace in entire area. The contractors used to work only on few days in a month,” they said.

Aurangabad: Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) president Raj Thackeray said on Friday that only the flag of his party had changed, not its original stand against Bangladeshis, Pakistani illegal migrants.

Thackeray claimed that he has not changed his stand or ideals in the past 15 years since he launched his party. He said his party had taken up many campaigns, which others didn’t dare to, despite talking about Hindutva.

“Our party has successfully campaigned against the Pakistani artists, the Bangladeshi auto-rickshaw and taxi drivers, who are in Mumbai. The party also spoke against use of loudspeakers at the mosques, no other party dared,” he said while speaking to the media.

Thackeray was in the city to gauge his party’s preparations ahead of the Aurangabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) elections in April. His stand is being closely watched as many Shiv Sena members are unhappy with the party decision to align with the Congress and the NCP to form the government in the state.

He also criticised the Aurangabad civic body and questioned why problems like garbage and drinking water could not solved for all these years. “When we were in power in Nashik municipal corporation, we handled these problems effectively. Why can’t these problems be resolved here,” he said.

Shiv Sena has been in power in Aurangabad for almost 30 years. The MNS chief has scheduled a number of meetings with party workers and the new entrant in the city during his stay.

Meanwhile, Suhas Dashrathe, a former district unit Shiv Sena president, joined the MNS in Thackeray’s presence. His entry would bolster the chances of MNS in civic polls scheduled in April this year.

Repair work of the bridge ramp underway at Bhopal station on Friday

BHOPAL: A day after the collapse of a concrete slab on the foot-bridge ramp at Bhopal railway station leaving eight injured, railways have suspended an engineer who had certified the bridge as safe and useable in March 2019.

The general manager (WCR), Shailendra Kumar inspected the Bhopal station and reviewed the situation. During the inspection, Kumar also took up the issue of the need for constructing another FoB at the station with the railway officials. Railway officials said injured passengers being treated at a private hospital are recovering fast.

The GM after inspecting the site ordered suspension of engineer BK Mishra.

A section of a footbridge ramp at Bhopal station — certified safe less than a year ago — collapsed on Thursday morning, sending eight passengers plunging 20 feet to the platform below. Meanwhile, repair work at the Bhopal station was also started in the morning.

During the inspection, Mishra visited all platforms. He said, “In-charge of the bridge who gave the last inspection report has been suspended. He will be suspended till the probe committee submits its report.” A senior administrative grade level committee is probing the accident. The committee has been asked to submit its report at the earliest. About the inspection, he said, “I came here to find out ways to regulate traffic at Bhopal railway station.”

He disclosed that an action plan is being prepared for better security and safety of passengers at the station. “The plan will be implemented in next 2-3 days,” he added.

After inspecting Bhopal station GM Kumar visited the hospital where the accident victims are being treated. He directed the railway officials to make available everything required for their fast recovery.

Meanwhile, the repair work of the ramp was also started. This time railways do not want to take any risk as extra steel support are being placed under the concrete to reinforce the ramp. Sources said steel reinforcements will be placed under all the ramps at the Bhopal station in the next couple of days.

DRM Bhopal Uday Borwanker told TOI that the priority is to strengthen the available foot-bridge structure. “As the bridge is almost 30-years-old the need of another FoB was also felt at the Bhopal station. We have discussed about its modalities,” said Borwanker.

Regarding the ramp closed from platform no-1 at the newly-constructed foot-bridge, Borwanker said, “We will try to open it for the passengers’ soon.” As the construction work is underway at the platform no-1 the ramp has been closed due to which the passengers coming from platform no-6 have to get down at platform no-2 and 3 and are supposed to take the old ramp and foot-bridge to get to platform no 1.

The 50-ft-long ramp, built in 1992, was certified safe in March 2019 by a high-level railways inspection team. The Sampark Kranti pulled into platform 2 around 9am. A group of 40 members of a family from Bhopal alighted and joined the crowd jostling up the ramp towards the foot over-bridge. At 9.10am, the section connected to the footbridge caved in, taking down eight to 10 people.

CCTV footage of the incident shows a cloud of smoke rise as the ramp slab crashes. Concrete beams and iron supports lie on the ground as passengers — some still holding plates of samosa or poha in one hand — race to save those trapped.

Where is Sharath Ashoka?

By: Shreyas HS & HM Mahendra KumarBALLARI: Under pressure, Ballari police on Friday set up two teams to investigate Monday’s Mercedes car crash on National Highway 50.Officials said one team will probe if revenue minister R Ashoka ’s son Sharath was present in the car.The postmortem on Sachin, a passenger in the car who died in the impact of the accident, was conducted around midnight at Hospet Government Hospital, indicating pressure on police officers and doctors. “Postmortems in government hospitals are conducted usually in the day. They are performed in the night only in special cases,” a source explained.Ballari additional superintendent of police BN Lavanya defended the police action and said, “In normal course, police don’t let off the driver. They do (let off) if doctors suggest they need to be shifted to a hospital in case of grievous injuries.”Asked why the doctors performed the postmortem in the night, she said: “You should ask the doctors. We in the (police) department obey the SP.”After handing over a cheque of Rs 50,000 to the kin of Ravi Naik, an 18-year-old construction worker from Mandya who was knocked down dead by the speeding Mercedes on National Highway, Hagaribommanahalli Congress MLA Bheema Naik said, “Conducting autopsy in the night is against the law. I’ll urge the chief minister and the home minister to conduct an impartial investigation into it.”He said the Hospet hospital has 16 CCTV cameras, but its authorities have refused to share footage with him. “All this raises several questions,” he said.Bharathi Bai, who works at a private hospital in Hospet, said: “Unidentified youths brought in an injured person to our hospital, but doctors refused to offer him treatment since it was a case of accident. Later, they took him to a government hospital. I can identify the youths.”Was Karnataka revenue minister R Ashoka’s son Sharath badly injured in the accident involving a Mercedes Benz that killed two persons on a national highway in Ballari district?As Ballari police personnel question the accused in the case, they are also trying to ascertain if the family and friends of those involved in the crash are still holding on to some facts and the exact roles played by the occupants of the car that crashed on Monday afternoon.Sleuths want to know why isn’t Ashoka asking Sharath to show up in public to clear the air on the controversy.Rahul, the prime suspect as per the police FIR, could face charges of misleading the police for his claim that he was driving the car at the time of accident. “We are investigating the reasons why the family isn’t revealing Sharath’s whereabouts,” a police inspector, part of the probe team, said.Senior police officers said Sharath’s presence in the car could be ascertained by tracking his mobile number’s activity on Monday.A police officer said the car’s airbag that opened in the accident could offer vital clues since the driver is impacted on his body or face in what’s called silicon bite or air-bag scrap. “Going by nature of injuries, one could find out who was possibly at the wheel,” he added.Eyewitness and police accounts said the Mercedes took the full impact, rolled over twice before crashing into a tea kiosk.In Video: Bengaluru car crash: Cops shielding Karnataka minister R Ashoka’s son?",bengaluru,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74143986,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-571035,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/two-police-teams-to-probe-merc-crash-near-ballari/articleshow/74142512.cms

Aurangabad: The Jawaharnagar police, probing a case human trafficking, have arrested a woman after the investigation officer found that her mother lodged a false complaint .

“The woman was actually unhappy with the fact that she was not paid the promised cash amount for marrying a man in another state,” said police on Friday.

On September 17, 2019, police had registered a missing case, before adding sections of IPC 370 (trafficking, sexual exploitation), 420 (cheating) and 120B (criminal conspiracy) against nine suspects and arrested them.

Police swung into action and rescued the 25-year old woman from Makla village of Mahidpur tehsil in Ujjan, Madhya Pradesh.

As per the complaint, the woman along with another, a relative, were sold in Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan after taking them there on the pretext of job. However, the probe revealed that the women were aware of the fact that they would have to temporarily stay with the men they were being married to and flee as and when they found an opportunity.

The probe has revealed that both the women were sold for Rs 1 lakh each to different men. Out of this amount, the duo were supposed to get Rs 10,000 each.

It was after the 25-year old woman, who is already married and has two children, neither got the promised amount nor was able to flee that her mother lodged a complaint, said police.

Assistant inspector Shraddha Vaydande said the accused, including Ranjanabai Jogdand (48), Jijabai Shinde (60) and Shivaji Dhanedar (58), during their custodial interrogation claimed that the women sold in other states were part of the racket, but police refused to believe them.

“However, it was after rescuing the second woman from Rajasthan, the picture became clear, following which the woman who was rescued from Madhya Pradesh came to be arrested for being part of the racket and also for misleading police.”

379,['15/02/2020'],"Amid protests, NMC sends list of 315 surplus teachers to state","This story is from February 15, 2020

Nagpur: Amid strong protests from office bearers and unions, the Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) has sent a list of 315 surplus teachers for absorption in state’s education department, as a step towards reducing high administrative expense. Mayor Sandip Joshi said the decision will not have much impact as the state government too has surplus teachers.

The cash-strapped NMC has been bearing financial burden of over Rs20 crore per annum on salaries and other benefits of 315 surplus teachers for last six years. Municipal commissioner Tukaram Mundhe learnt about this during a review meeting of NMC education department and directed officials to send the list to state’s education department.

Accordingly, Mundhe approved the list and NMC education officer Priti Mishrikotkar on Friday sent the list to deputy director of education department Satish Mendhe. Now, the state’s education department will start absorbing NMC’s surplus teachers in government-aided and zilla parishad-run schools, in case there are vacancies. The teachers can be absorbed in other districts in case there are no vacancies in the district and paucity of teachers in other districts.

Joshi added, “NMC has large number of vacancies in other departments. Surplus teachers should have been absorbed in NMC itself. They were recruited by NMC so they and their families were never a burden,” he said.

Joshi, leader of opposition Tanaji Wanve and corporators from all political parties had taken a decision to support surplus teachers.

The list comprises 255 teachers from Marathi medium, 33 from Hindi, 8 from Urdu (all from primary section), and 19 from secondary section.

President of Nagpur Mahanagarpalika Shikshak Sangh Rajesh Gavre said the move was unjust to teachers. “Education department sought suggestions/objections from teachers within 24 hours, which should have been atleast 15 days. Department was supposed to hear all, which too was avoided. I requested thrice the office of municipal commissioner to meet and hold discussions but got no time. Any decision before giving chance to atleast hear is bad in law. Therefore, we are left with no option other than to approach court,” he said.

The NMC’s large number of schools had shut down with decrease in number of students so 315 teachers became surplus as per state government’s students-teachers ratio.

Senior citizens dance at a V-Day function at Shivaji Park on Friday

MUMBAI: As Suresh Saoji (84) serenaded his wife on wobbly knees in full public view at Shivaji Park , Suman (82) blushed. As the elderly couple danced to the tunes of old Hindi film songs, a crowd of senior citizens cheered them on. The Saojis were among a mix of elderly persons who had gathered at Aajee-Aazobaa Udyaan to celebrate Valentine’s Day for senior citizens on Friday morning. The garden, usually a quiet spot at the buzzing maidan, was adorned with red heart-shaped balloons and there was frenetic activity around.

Organised by HelpAge India, the aim of the event was to hammer out a message to children and youngsters that Valentine’s Day is not just romance between young people, said Prakash Borgaonkar, director of HelpAge India. “We wanted to change the clichéd idea that Valentine’s Day is only for young lovers. Our aim was to tell youngsters that even your grandparents can be your Valentine,” said Borgaonkar.

So, children from Ryan International School, Chembur, came face-to-face with the elderly. As the kids belted out songs, grey-haired couples danced while others in the audience gently swayed their heads to the flow of music.

Mahim resident Deepa Govekar said she could not have missed the V-Day event. “I come to the garden regularly to take walks and use the gym equipment here,” she said. “Today, of course, it was special due to Valentine’s Day celebrations.” Chief guests, TV actors Dr Girish Oak and Nivedita Saraf, protagonists of a Marathi serial that centres on the lives of senior citizens, shared anecdotes of the hardship of the aged.

Among the crowd was Dadar resident Shashikant Naik (87), who hobbled around the garden with a walking stick and a cloth bag slung across his shoulder. “I come here regularly to spend time with people of my age. And it charges me mentally,” said Naik, a widower.

At the end of the morning, HelpAge India had a message for the elderly. “Ageing does not mean all is over,” Borgaonkar told the crowd. “In fact, it’s just the beginning. Live every day with love. Let each day be Valentine’s Day.”

381,['15/02/2020'],Parties publishing candidates’ criminal cases of little use: Analysts,"This story is from February 15, 2020

BENGALURU: Political analysts say the Supreme Court’s order to parties, instructing them to publish the entire criminal history of candidates, is a step in the right direction but it is unlikely to clear up the system.

They say the only way forward is either for voters to show zero tolerance for candidates with criminal antecedents, or parties to stay clear of fielding such candidates.

“We welcome the SC order, but it is just a step,” said L Vasudev Murthy, an educationist from Bengaluru. “Unless political parties stand up and decide against fielding candidates with criminal background, no amount of legislation will help contain the menace.”

The SC on Thursday ordered political parties to publish the criminal history of candidates for assembly and Lok Sabha elections along with reasons that forced them to field “suspected criminals over decent people”.

The information must be published in a local as well as a national newspaper besides the parties’ social media handles within 48 hours of selection of candidates or less than two weeks before the first date for filing of nominations, whichever is earlier.

“This information [criminal cases] is already out there in public domain and publishing it again will be of little use,” said Trilochan Shastry of Association for Democratic Reforms (ADR). “It will not solve the problem of criminalisation of politics. However, the Supreme Court seems to feel that it cannot go beyond this step.”

ADR, a body which aims to improve governance and strengthen democracy through electoral and political reforms, has been creating awareness among voters by publishing criminals antecedents of candidates. The information is sourced from candidates’ sworn affidavits.

However, AT Ramaswamy, JD(S) MLA, who has been fighting against encroachment of government land, welcomed the move while expressing hope that it will address the problem to some extent.

“Currently, all candidates declare cases filed against them in their election affidavits, but not many people know about it,” Ramaswamy said. “Now, the onus is on political parties to explain to people why they gave a ticket to a candidate with criminal antecedents. So, parties will have to be careful while selecting candidates. I welcome the SC order.”

Kolhapur: The deputy education director of education, Kolhapur, in a letter, directed all the schools in the region to take prior permission from its office, education officer and also from an administrative officer of the municipal corporation before involving students in any kind of political rally or rally-like activity.

The deputy education director office has issued a letter to the education officers on February 12, asking them to convey the communication to the schools across the district.

He has also asked the schools to take prior consent of the parents and parent-teachers’ association before involving students in rallies.

Headmasters flouting the said instructions will be liable for the disciplinary action, the letter added.

The action was taken after a complaint in this regard was filed by the Kolhapur City and District Citizens’ Action Committee (KCDCAC).

The committee members highlighted the matter to the deputy education director S D Sonawane, following which he issued the letter.

Ramesh More, member of KCDCAC, told TOI, “It has been learned that students are being used as a political tool in various rallies which is affecting their studies. These students are mostly from the government-run schools like zilla parishad and civic schools. They are made to stand for hours or to walk long distances for no apparent reason. These rallies have nothing to do with academics.”

He said that one would not see students from private schools in such rallies as these schools do not indulge in any such activities; however, the students from the civic or ZP schools are literally ‘used’ for gaining political mileage.

“It has been observed that students from Classes IV to VII are generally seen for some official programs or happenings for the government as well as private agitations or demonstrations, which should not be permitted at all,” he said.

BHOPAL: Madhya Pradesh government has finally framed a preschool education policy to regulate pre-schooling in government as well as private schools. The policy has been framed by women and child development department. As a part of this policy, private schools would also be made responsible for growth, monitoring, nutrition and immunization of kids.

In government pre-schools, run by anganwadi centres, the government has outlined the syllabus and activities to take place in the year with complete timetable. Its pilot project has already begun in 313 identified anganwadis. As the next step, private preschools would be asked to register with the women and child welfare department.

Sources informed that government does not wish to regulate fee and syllabus of private preschools at this stage, but wants to ensure that all preschools share students’ data and health conditions with the government. Officials, requesting anonymity, said there was no preschool policy in the state till now. Maharashtra government also expressed the desire to follow the same in a meeting of officials held between the two states recently.

Going by the official record, there are 40 lakh children between 3 and 6 years of age and 35 lakh kids between 6 months and 3 years in the state. As per the state government business rules, newborn to six-year-old kids are taken care of by the women and child development department and from class one onwards, the students come under the school education department.

Training of anganwadi workers has been done, especially to promote and nurture the preschooling process. Women and child development minister Imarti Devi said, “This preschool policy has been introduced in the state to ensure that all the children, rich or poor, get good preschool education.”

Officials said in the preschools at anganwadi centres, known as Bal Shiksha Kendra, the students would be given certificates; syllabus would be on par with the private schools and will be changed as per the needs. A month-wise syllabus for 19 subjects has been prescribed for children between three and six years at anganwadis. It also covers topics like self-identification, my home, personal hygiene, colours and images, temperature and environment, animals and birds, means of transport, safety rules, helpful weather, children's confidence and our festivals.

Apart from education, students would be taught basic manners, especially giving respect to their parents.

AURANGABAD: Kranti Chowk police have arrested a woman, who claimed to be unmarried, for allegedly cheating a youth by marrying him and fleeing with his valuables on the very next day of the marriage.

The woman has been slapped with sections 406 (criminal breach of trust) and 420 (cheating) of the IPC. Police have launched a manhunt for two of her accomplices, one of whom is a woman matrimonial agent.

Police said that Sriram Veerbhan Patil hailing from neighbouring Jalgaon district was looking for a suitable match. He came across this woman who introduced herself as a matromonial agent and assured to help him find a suitable bride from a humble background.

The agent convinced Patil to bear all the marriage expenses, following which the marriage was solemnised in Jalgaon on January 30. The woman agent and her male accomplice reportedly took Rs 1 lakh from Patil for finding him a suitable bride.

On the very next day of their marriage, Patil’s wife informed him that her mother was unwell. Accordingly, Patil and his wife reached the Central bus stand in Aurangabad to take a bus to the woman’s hometown. The woman was wearing the gold ornaments that Patil had given to her at the time of their marriage.

The woman left him on the pretext of answering nature’s call and fled away. When she did not return for a couple of hours, he started looking for her but in vain. Worried about her sudden disappearance, Patil lodged a missing complaint at Kranti chowk police station.

Taking serious cognizance of a newly-wed woman mysteriously missing from the Central bus stand, police launched a hunt for the woman and found that she had returned to her native place.

Preliminary investigation has revealed that the woman was not only married but also a mother of two children. She was part of a racket whose modus operandi is cheating people like she duped Patil. Police said that soon after knowing about her arrest, the woman’s accomplices have reportedly gone underground.

Police have also recovered the gold ornaments and the cash that she had taken with her while fleeing from Patil.

Ahmedabad: The Gujarat high court on Friday raised a question about the invocation of atrocity charges against the promoters and employees of Nandan Denim Ltd in Narol, where a unit caught fire resulting in the deaths of seven employees last week.

Three accused persons – company director P K Sharma, general manager of the shirting division B C Patel and fire safety officer Ravikant Sinha – approached the high court seeking the quashing of the FIR filed against them in connection with the fire.

They claimed innocence and objected to the invocation of charges under Sections 304 and 114 of the IPC, for culpable homicide not amounting to murder and abetment. They also objected to the invocation of atrocity laws against them, merely because one of the seven persons killed belonged to a scheduled caste.

388,['15/02/2020'],Firm with links to Sasikala moves HC against I-T action,"This story is from February 15, 2020

Chennai: One more firm, accused by I-T officials of being a ‘benami’ of V K Sasikala , close aide of the late chief minister J Jayalalithaa, has approached the Madras high court to quash attachment of its shares in ‘Perambur Spectrum Mall’ under the Prohibition of Benami Property Transactions Act.

Chennai-based Ganga Foundations Private Limited has been accused by the income tax department of acting as benami of Sasikala by putting to use Rs 130 crore received from her in demonetised currency.

On January 20, the deputy commissioner of income tax (Benami Prohibition), Chennai, passed an order under section 24(4) of the Act confirming the provisional attachment of 65% shares held by the company in the mall. The issue pertains to I-T raids in November 2017 on the premises of the company consequent to a separate search conducted at various places connected to Sasikala. During the search, various documents were seized and statement was recorded from S Senthil Kumar, managing director of the company. Based on the material, the department initiated proceedings against the company under the Benami Act, resulting in attachment of its shares in the mall.

Challenging the attachment order, the company has moved the present plea.

When the plea came up for hearing before Justice Anita Sumanth, the petitioner contended that the entire proceeding is based against a ‘commercial transaction’ which was not complete due to unforeseen circumstance and that it in no way could be called a benami transaction.

Representing the department, advocate A P Srinivas sought time to get instructions from the authorities concerned. Recording the same, the court directed the department to file its counter by March 6.

According to the petitioner, Spectrum Mall was a joint venture between the company and the land owners in which the company was holding 65% of shares. As the company was burdened with the interest on the borrowings from the bank, it decided to dispose of the property in 2016. Meanwhile, advocate S Senthil claiming to be negotiating on behalf of Jayalalithaa proposed to buy the property. The price was finalised as Rs 192.50 crore. In the meantime, demonetisation of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 denominations came into effect. In December 2016, the company was forced to sign a memorandum and to accept Rs 130 crore in demonetised currency from Senthil.

Dehradun: Most government offices wore a deserted look on Friday as employees boycotted work to stage a march in favour of the demand to restart the departmental promotion committee (DPC) meeting and follow the Supreme Court order on the issue of reservation in promotions.

Under the umbrella of over a dozen associations of the government employees of different departments, thousands of government staff members gathered at Parade Ground on Friday and walked towards the secretariat building, where they met chief secretary Utpal Kumar Singh and put forth their demands.

The protesters also announced to hold a protest along with their family members on February 20. Few days ago, employees had set ablaze an effigy of Congress party and Rahul Gandhi for the latter's remarks on the issue of reservation in promotion in government jobs.

Speaking about the stir, Deepak Joshi, who heads the association of secretariat employees and is also the chairperson of Uttarakhand General-OBC Employees' Association, said, “We put forth our demands to the chief secretary. A memorandum addressed to the chief minister was also handed over to the chief secretary.”

He added that “despite the Supreme Court order on the issue of reservation in promotion on February 7 this year, the state government has yet not revoked its order of September 11, 2019 through which it had stopped promotion in government jobs.”

Joshi said that before the issue takes a “political colour” and is delayed further, the order needs to be taken back. “Many government employees have been deprived of promotion in the past few months and justice should not be denied to them,” he added.

Virendra Singh Gosain, general secretary of Uttarakhand General-OBC Employees Association, said that the new reservation roster for the government jobs needs to be followed. “The protest was called as no action was taken in the issue of promotion of government employees even though the apex court had given its judgment on the issue a week ago,” he added.

Meanwhile, state urban development minister Madan Kaushik said that ""the issue will be resolved soon."" ""We will look into the matter and take the required steps,"" he told TOI.

KOCHI: The ambitious Rs 500 crore project for developing the Ernakulam Junction railway station complex has been set in motion. Rail Land Development Authority (RLDA) has approached Greater Cochin Development Authority (GCDA) for acquisition of its land on the eastern margins of the station.

The land will be developed to improve passenger amenities and the road network to the station. “We received a letter from RLDA today. We will hold a meeting to discuss their demand,” said V Salim, GCDA chairman.

RLDA’s chairman and senior officials had visited the station a month back, following which Kerala Industrial Technical Consultancy Organisation (Kitco), the consultant, was asked to redesign the project. GCDA was approached after the revised plan brought land belonging to it into the picture. The project now also involves a new four-storey building, to come up on GCDA land, providing more amenities to passengers who enter the station from Karshaka Road.

“We will share the redesign with Southern Railways next week. Once they accept the project, we will work out the financial valuation. This will be submitted to the Niti Aayog for approval. The Aayog has already given us in-principle approval for moving ahead with the revised plan,” said RLDA vice-chairman Ved Prakash Dudeja.

We have written to GCDA for their land. Railway land will be used to develop the road network, which is now just a narrow stretch. The existing building will remain and we will develop it as an independent second entry to the station,” he said.

Two buildings are to be built on the western wing of the station after demolishing of the existing structure housing offices and ticket counters. The old quarters will be razed to make way for a six-storey commercial building. All the mandatory railway infrastructure and passenger amenities will be part of the main building, which will be a five-storied one. The remaining spaces in the main building will be for commercial use. The development on the western end was part of the original plan

The existing car park to the east of the station is spread over an acre of GCDA land.

BHOPAL: Empowering women to rise against all sorts of domestic violence and take back their lives, Gaurvi-One Stop Crisis Centre of Bhopal in collaboration with other organizations working for welfare of women, including Udaan, Action Aid etc, organised a programme ‘Bol ki lab azad hain tere’ where more than 600 survivors of domestic violence shared their stories. Public Relations Minister P C Sharma also flagged off 6 e-rickshaws that will be driven by the survivors of domestic violence.

Showing solidarity with One Billion Rising global campaign, founded by Eve Ensler, to end rape and sexual violence, the women opened up about their suffering and encouraged other women going through the same ordeal to stand for themselves. Sharing their stories, the survivors recalled some of the most harrowing incidents that they were put though and how they summed up the courage to get out of the situation.

Shivani Saini, centre-coordinator of the One Stop Crisis centre said, “We have helped the survivors get a subsidy on the e-rickshaws, so that they can drive passengers around the city and earn their living. By the end of the year, we are planning to have at least 1000 e-rickshaws and are also providing proper training to the women. Their documents and licences have also been made.”

393,['15/02/2020'],SC speeds up process of hearing pleas against death sentences,"This story is from February 15, 2020

NEW DELHI: Against the backdrop of the growing demand for speedy decisions in cases involving heinous crimes, the Supreme Court on Friday framed a set of guidelines that mandate apex court benches to hear appeals challenging decisions of high courts confirming award of death sentences in six months. ""In matters wherein the HC has confirmed/upheld death penalty, and this court has granted leave, the criminal appeals will be listed for hearing not later than six months before the three-judge bench from the date of grant of leave irrespective of the fact that the appeal is ready or not,"" the SC said.

The SC had admitted the appeals of the four Nirbhaya case convicts against their death sentence on March 15, 2014, and finally upheld the capital punishment on May 5, 2017.

In the Nirbhaya case, the four convicts had moved the SC challenging the March 13, 2014 decision of the HC upholding award of death sentence.

The SC stayed their execution on March 15 before finally upholding the capital punishment on May 5, 2017.

Similarly, in the case involving Sonia and Sanjeev, who had killed seven of her family members over a property dispute, the matter lingered for two years in the SC when they challenged the death sentence.

The case involving Ravi, who had raped and killed a minor girl, took nearly three years in the SC before the death penalty was commuted to imprisonment for entire life.

In the case of Shabnam, who with her lover killed six members of her family, including a 10-month-old, to grab property and to end the daily admonitions by her father, her appeal against the HC's decision confirming death sentence took the SC two years to decide.

Keeping in mind the delay in such cases, the guidelines framed by the SC said, ""As soon as the special leave petition involving death penalty is filed, a communication from the SC registry may be sent... for summoning of original case records within 60 days from filing of such appeal.""

After the appeals are admitted for hearing by the SC, the parties would be allowed 30 days to file any additional document. This will prevent appellants' counsel from seeking repeated adjournment of hearings. The guidelines also said if adjournment was sought in matters involving the death penalty, it would be listed before chamber judges instead of the present practice of these requests getting decided by SC registrars.

Ahmedabad: Will 300-plus students of National Institute of Design (NID) be second time lucky at the same date a month later? If sources are to be believed, NID has internally conveyed March 7 as the new date for the convocation. The premier design institute had hastily cancelled the convocation on February 7, leaving hundreds of the students and their parents in the lurch.

An official close to the development told TOI that the institute is mulling March 7 as the new date. “It’s currently under wraps and is not communicated to the larger audience,” said the official, adding that suspense continues on the chief guest. “It’s not decided whether it would be danseuse Mallika Sarabhai, the original chief guest, or someone else.”

Officials however fear that the controversy surrounding cancellation of the convocation just four days before the big day stole some shin off the event. “Several students, now working abroad, had come only for the event along with their parents. It’s possible that many parents may give the event a miss,” said an official.

While NID officials have remained tightlipped about the reason for cancelling the convocation, sources suggested invite to Sarabhai and fear of black ribbons worn by the students in support of anti-CAA stir as some of the possibilities.

395,['15/02/2020'],Mullappally slams Pinarayi’s remarks on RSS ideologue,"This story is from February 15, 2020

Kozhikode: It is a shame for a communist leader like chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan to state that late RSS ideologue P Parameshwaran was a ‘saint-like’ figure, said KPCC president Mullappally Ramachandran .

Delivering the keynote address at the Shaheen Bagh Square organised by the Muslim Youth League (MYL) here on Friday, he said there is nothing wrong in paying homage to a departed person. “But Vijayan should make it clear whether the words he wrote on Parameshwaran had come from his heart,” he said.

Mullappally said Vijayan wrote the words on Parameshwaran in his own handwriting. “Vijayan had not written on any other person in his own handwriting in the recent past,” he said.

The Congress leader reminded the Muslim community that the CPM never stood with the minorities in the country in the past. The condition of the Muslims is dismal in West Bengal where the CPM ruled for 33 years, he said.

KPCC president alleged that there is an undercurrent between Vijayan and Prime Minister Narendra Modi as is evident from the former’s handling of the issues related state police chief Loknatha Behera and governor Arif Muhammad Khan.

Mullappally claimed that his position of not going for a joint struggle with the CPM on the CAA was vindicated by the recent developments. “I was against joining hands with the CPM as I am aware of the history of the party,” he said.

The CPM considered the Muslim community only as a vote bank. The party organized beef festivals and protested when Saddam Hussein was killed only to capitalise on the Muslim sentiments, he said.

But on the ground the CPM always targeted the members of the Muslim community. The murder of Youth Congress worker Shuhaib and MSF activist Ariyil Shukkur and the riots in Nadapuram are the examples of the CPM’s anti-Muslim stand, Mullappally said.

MYL state general secretary P K Firos, KPCC vice-president T Siddique, KSU leader K M Abhijith and others attended the meeting.

Sheesh Mahal (File photo)

NEW DELHI: Delhi Sikh Gurdwara Management Committee (DSGMC) on Saturday objected to restoration of 17th century palace—Sheesh Mahal—in north Delhi’s Shalimar Bagh , where sixth Mughal emperor Aurangzeb’s coronation took place in 1658.

Addressing a press conference, DSGMC president Manjinder Singh Sirsa and other members called the Mughal emperor “a cruel leader and a murderer,” and said that it was unfortunate that the decision to renovate the structure was taken in the 400th birth anniversary year of Guru Tegh Bahadur. “Guru Tegh Bahadur sacrificed his life against Aurangzeb’s attempts of forceful conversions. It is surprising that Aurangzeb has been glorified despite his atrocities on Sikh gurus. People need to be reminded of his bloody past, instead of glorifying things associated with him,” said Sirsa, who is also a member of Shiromani Akali Dal.

“We strongly oppose the decision to refurbish the structure with public funds. It will hurt the sentiments of lakhs of people. We will hit the streets if ASI does not take back its decision,” he added.

TOI had published a report on Thursday regarding Archaeological Survey of India (ASI)’s plans of spending Rs 2-5 crore on sprucing up the Aurangzeb’s coronation site, which lies dilapidated.

Margao: Stanley Rozario has seen Indian football from so close for so long that he knows not everything is at it seems.

“In I-League and Indian football, anything can happen, anytime,” said Rozario, who has coached some of India’s biggest clubs like Mohun Bagan , East Bengal and Salgaocar FC, and is now guiding former champions Aizawl FC .

On the looks of it, Mohun Bagan are now the overwhelming favourites to win the I-League after opening a 11-point gap at the top of the table. But like Rozario affirmed, there is still many a slip between the cup and the lip.

“Mohun Bagan are in the driver’s seat but let’s wait and see what happens. Openings will be there till the 15th round. We cannot say who will finish on top,” said the Aizawl coach, wondering how they have been left behind by Bagan, who they held goalless in their opening game.

It’s the same with Churchill Brothers too. When Bernardo Tavares took charge of the team, his first assignment was against Bagan in Kolkata, a match Churchill won 4-2. Since then, not everything has gone according to the Portuguese coach’s plan.

“It’s difficult to work in this situation because we feel the team is working in the right direction. Not everything has gone our way. Moral victories don’t count. They don’t give you any points,” said Tavares.

Churchill have played three matches less than Bagan. But even if they win all three, they will still find themselves seven points behind the leaders. Catching up with Bagan – who visit Goa next week – won’t be easy, although Tavares maintains they must get back to winning ways, starting with the clash against Aizawl at the Nehru Stadium in Fatorda on Saturday.

“It’s important to get three points against Aizawl. They play direct football, they are a physical team and have strong strikers,” explained Tavares.

It’s not the same Aizawl who they drew 2-2 away. For the visitors, much has changed; they now have six foreigners, better understanding, and even though Rozario laughed that their best results came with just two foreign players in their rank, the inclusion of South Americans has sparked improvement.

For Churchill, it’s been a mixed bag. The team that hammered Bagan away and drubbed Neroca at home have also lost, quite inexplicably, to Indian Arrows, TRAU and Chennai City FC at home. In all three games, Churchill were the most dominant team, creating a plethora of goal-scoring chances.

“The most difficult thing is to create opportunities. If they can create, then they will score. But our last game (against Chennai) was a mix of bad luck and poor scoring. Everyone, of course, will only remember the result.

“We can now no longer make excuses that we were unlucky. We cannot say that all the time. We need to be more focused, attentive when shooting at goal. That’s also important,” said Tavares.

Churchill cannot afford to be wayward again.

Jaipur: The local self government (LSG) department has decided to serve final termination notice to three firms for failing to carry out digitisation work under the Smart Raj project .

Smart Raj project was given to three firms who had to jointly conduct digitisation work in 32 urban local bodies including seven municipalities and 25 municipal councils in the state. The digitization work included the property survey of Jaipur city which was last conducted in 2005. Firms were given contract in 2015 with a deadline of 2017 but after many extensions, till 2020 they haven’t been able to complete the project and finally government has decided to serve the termination notice.

Secretary of UDH Bhawani Singh Dehta wasn’t available for an official comment.

An officer at the LSG said that many times extensions were given to the firm. “The entire project was Rs 124 crore of which nothing was given to the firm as the work was never completed. In 2018, Smart Raj was fined as well but still they were given extension and result was same. As per the agreement they were supposed to upload the data of birth and death but they sublet it to someone who further sublet it to someone else. When the work was completed it was rejected by the municipalities as wasn’t authentic. In these five years, I believe state has bear the loss of Rs 1,000 crore that would have been gained if the project was completed but still no strict action have been taken against the firm,” said one official.

Pramod Kumar, deputy project manager of Smart Raj project said that they are not being paid by the government on time. “We are asked to present proof of our work. This is not termination and within a week we will submit a reply. Government should also give us payment on time to expect result,” said Pramod.

In the notice it is mentioned that after many extensions given to the Smart Raj project, work was not up to the mark and it was assessed either the firms were unable to complete the work or not willing to complete the work. Within 30 days they have to submit a reply or final termination of contract will be done.

The ‘Indianness’ of the limo, envisioned in midnight blue, is reflected in the material used for the interiors

AHMEDABAD: For many heads of state, their preferred ride not only reflects their status but also their country’s automobile prowess.

Even before US President Donald Trump visits the city, his land and aerial transport are in the news. That was the genesis of the ambitious Presidential Limousine project initiated by Kunal Kashyap, a second-year transportation and automobile design (TAD) student of NID Gandhinagar.

“We wanted automobile design philosophy rooted in India and thus Tata was a natural choice,” said Kashyap, who along with the NID team had showcased the scale model for Tata Garuda, the name of the limo given by him, at Auto Expo 2020 recently. “We got inspiration from its newer Impact 2.0 designs with the slingshot line — running from the hood and wrapping around the entire profile before coming back — and split headlamps,” Kashyap said.

The team members said that the wheels for the president should have gravitas and road presence befitting the presidential stature while ensuring safety and stability.

Kashyap added that the ‘Indianness’ of the limo, envisioned in midnight blue, is also reflected in interiors. “We chose tussar silk which is tear-proof, instead of leather for upholstery. Another material we chose is transparent wood,” said Kashyap. He said that the response from experts including Pratap Bose, the vice-president of global design at Tata Motors and an NID alumnus, is encouraging.

Other concepts also steal the show: Regin Muralidharan, another student, displayed the concept of Mahindra Rath — a three-seater luxury SUV — taking inspiration from the temple rath. Harris Raju has conceived of a futuristic flying pod for 2040 India. Sandeep Jena, their teammate, presented the concept of Mazda Tamashi, a hypercar for the LeMans race. “We had designed a VR experience. Thus, it was a double challenge to provide a 1:1 scale experience to visitors,” he said.

Transport planner, traffic engineer and VNIT assistant professor Udit Jain suggested two solutions — short-term and long-term — providing a curve (on left side of the flyover’s landing connecting with the road near Kasturchand Park) and make roads along Kasturchand Park one-way. Implementing one-way vehicular movement road along KP will require enforcement from traffic police.

To a query, Landge said, “No one can be blamed for the flyover’s landing mess, it is just a matter of lack of coordination.”

Learning from the haphazard infrastructure planning lapse, it is time the city gets a UMTA, said Jain. “The people, apart from all stakeholders, must be invited to express opinion while implementing an infrastructure project. Experts should take these suggestions into consideration for flawless implementation of the project,” added Landge.

Though VNIT has received a letter to share its opinion to resolve the mess, both traffic police and NHAI are not showing any further interest. “So, we have not prepared any report in this regard,” said Landge.

To this, a senior traffic cop from deputy commissioner of police Chinmay Pandit’s office said NHAI has given a letter to VNIT to conduct the study and simultaneously the city traffic police had sought permission from the divisional commissioner for the same. “Now, we are awaiting the nod,” he said.

HYDERABAD: Allowing the petition filed by All India Industrial Exhibition society, Telangana High Court on Friday extended Numaish 2020 for three days.

In wake of requests from traders across India, the society on Friday noon moved a lunch-motion before Telangana High Court and sought permission to extend Numaish 2020 by three days. While considering the petition of Exhibition Society, a division bench comprising Chief Justice Raghavendra Singh Chauhan and Justice Abhishek Reddy allowed it to conduct Numaish for three more days till February 18 subject to the clearance from authorities.

The court said: “However, as artisans from all over the country bring their goods to be sold on the Exhibition Ground, and since the sales have been rather slow, the society proposes to extend the functioning of the exhibition till February 18.” In December 2019, a division bench of the HC had granted permission for the Numaish- 2020 event.

BHOPAL: The Kamal Nath government on Friday announced investments worth Rs 3,250 crore with the potential to generate 14,000 jobs. During a daylong round-table at Delhi, CM Nath rolled out major policy initiatives for major players in textile and apparel sectors .

The Hoshangabad-based Trident group will expand its existing unit in Budhni with an investment of Rs 3,000 crore. “This will have employment generation potential for 10,000 people,” said Rajesh Rajora, principal secretary industry, after Nath’s meeting with representatives of the textile sector.

The CM announced a 60-acre plug-and-play industrial park in Badiya Khedi in Sehore district, just 28km from Bhopal airport and close to Bhopal-Indore highway.

Nath announced several measures for ease of doing business in Madhya Pradesh . “Immediate clearances and licenses will be provided for up to 40 services within seven working days,” Nath said, adding that the state will devise more incentives for manufacturing of textile and apparel from organic cotton.

“Any industry with investment of less than Rs 100 crore but employing more than 500 people will be accorded status of mega industry and will be eligible for customized package,” said the CM.

As per the existing scheme, industries with Rs 100 crore or more investment were considered mega industries for which customized package used to be approved by cabinet committee for investment promotion.

“Until now, garment units which are outside the limits of textile park or industrial parks, were not eligible for incentives under the government’s garment policy. Now, they will also be eligible for incentives offered under the garment sector package,” the CM said, promising to take up policy for incentivizing composite and integrated units in textile sector.

The government has urged private developers to come forward to develop a garment park at Barlai, 20km from Indore, on public-private-partnership model. It announced investments of Rs 100 crore and Rs 50 crore by Mayur Uniquoters and Gokaldas Exports. The two units will generate 4,000 jobs in all, Rajora said.

Hyderabad: With SC, ST and BC communities shifting their loyalties to the ruling TRS after Telangana came into being, Congress is now going the whole hog to connect with young voters of SC, ST and BC communities to revive its political fortunes.

The Congress leadership has decided to make a big issue in the wake of Supreme Court making observations to do away with quota for these communities. Sources said the party is mobilising youngsters for a maha dharna it is organising at Indira Park on February 16 in protest against moves to discontinue reservations.

SC, ST communities were once a strong votebank of Congress but have steadily moved away and begun supporting TRS in various elections the state has seen.

AICC general secretary in charge of Telangana RC Khuntia and TPCC president N Uttam Kumar Reddy have asked party members to go to the doorsteps of SC and ST communities and interact with the family members. The party members are also meeting students from these communities in colleges and universities.

Congress is also trying to convince BCs that the ruling TRS has shown little interest in their political empowerment and had even reduced BC quota in the gram panchayat polls.

BCs comprise 52% of the total population in Telangana but its votebank is divided among political parties with a large chunk rooting for TRS. “Any step to withdraw reservations to SCs and STs will not be tolerated,” AICC secretary V Hanumanth Rao warned.

Jaipur: Chief minister Ashok Gehlot on Friday said that the initiative to open English medium government schools in the state has been a tremendous success. By learning English, children in government schools gained confidence and stood on par with those from private schools, Gehlot said at a private school function here on Friday.

The chief minister stated that there was no dearth of talent among the Hindi-speaking people, but in today’s times, the importance of English has increased in all fields of life. “Hindi-speaking children do not get as many opportunities as those who are fluent in English,” he said.

“The government’s duty is to take decisions that benefit the common man. Keeping this in sight, our government took steps to provide quality education to children from marginalised sections. Our effort has been to provide education to every child so that s/he can progress,” Gehlot said while speaking at the Jayshree Periwal Global School in Jagatpura.

Minister for primary and secondary education Govind Singh Dotasra said the present government intends to provide quality education to every child, be it in government or private schools. “The state government wants to support private schools in tandem with the government schools to ensure access to quality education to all children,” said Dotasra.

“English medium schools have been opened in all 33 districts to provide equal opportunities to children from every section of the society. Today, 11,850 children are studying in English medium schools across Rajasthan, which is now number 2 in terms of quality education,” Dotasra said.

Chief secretary D B Gupta said that literacy rate in the state increased from a mere 8.95% in 1951 to 66.11% in 2011. “The male literacy rate stands at 79.19%, which is equivalent to the national average, but the female literacy rate is just 52.12%. Considerable efforts are needed to educate the girl child,” Gupta said.

MUMBAI: Mumbai’s first roll-on roll-off ( Ro-Ro ) ship, which will carry passengers along with their bikes, cars and even buses between Ferry Wharf (Bhaucha Dhakka) and Mandwa (Alibaug), arrived from Greece on Friday to a rousing welcome from the shipping fraternity.To be commissioned in the first week of March, it will probably be the country’s first big passenger-vehicle transport ship that will operate even during monsoon and thus will serve traffic 365 days and also 24x7, said MbPT chairman Sanjay Bhatia. “We have been anxiously looking forward to such a facility as we will be able to get our bikes or cars to reach Parel from Ferry Wharf instead of spending on taxis. We can also easily do late-night shifts now,” said Anamika Kulkarni, who works with a media firm at Parel and at times has to rush to catch the last boat at 6pm. Now, three others from Alibaug can join her in a car, thus saving on fuel.The ship will initially travel every three hours till the second one is introduced. As per the agreement with the contractor, Esquire Shipping, a major stakeholder in the M2M Ferries consortium, the second ship is to be brought into service once the first attains 60% occupancy in a day. Dr Anirudh Kohli, radiology department head at Breach Candy Hospital, who has a weekend home in Alibaug, said the 24x7 Ro-Ro ship is a big boon as other services shut at night and during four monsoon months.Around 10-20% of 5,000 passengers who use catamarans to Mandwa from Gateway of India daily and about 100 cars and four buses which travel to Konkan from Mumbai are expected to move to the Ro-Ro ship, say sources. The ship has a capacity for 500 passengers and 180 cars. Vehicles to Goa will save three hours travel time by ship.Aashim Mongia of M2M Ferries said, “People from Alibaug and beyond can come to Mumbai with their bikes and cars and go back. We expect to achieve our target of 60% occupancy in just two to three years or maybe even faster,” he said.In Video: Mumbai: Ro-pax service set to begin for commuters, motorists",mumbai,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74144402,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-343014,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/get-your-car-on-24x7-ship-for-ferry-wharf-mandwa/articleshow/74140829.cms

The annual High School Certificate examination is slated to start from February 19 and Plus II examinations from March 3. The Class X and XII examinations, conducted by the CBSE (Central Board of Secondary Education) will start from February 20 and 15 respectively. The Class X ICSE examinations will begin from February 27.

“The frequent power cuts is affecting the studies of my son who will appear for the matriculation examination this year,” said Shantilata Mishra of Shakti Nagar. Parents are of the opinion that the power cuts should be stopped at least during examination time.

Social activist Sudhir Sabat said Southco should rethink about the unscheduled power cuts. “When there is no official announcement about the power cuts, it is unfortunate that there is no electricity for around three to four hours in different areas of the district,” he said.

Southco officials said there have been no power cuts officially. “The load shedding might be taking place in different areas due to transfer of transformers, replacement of cables and upgradation of electricity lines,” said superintendent of Southco Chandan Das. “These works are being executed under the Integrated Power Development Scheme (IPDS) and is expected to be completed by March-end,” he said.

He assured that the distribution company would ensure to continue power supply during the examination time as there is no short supply of electricity.

Nagpur: A day after municipal commissioner Tukaram Mundhe admitted to stopping development works, ruling party leader and BJP corporator Sandip Jadhav sought time with him to discuss issues regarding the city’s development.

On Friday, a delegation of BSP corporators met Mundhe and appealed to him to sanction their files for pending works otherwise citizens will be put to inconvenience, in the absence of basic civic amenities.

BSP corporator and party leader Vaishali Narnawre told TOI, “We informed the commissioner that already BJP-ruled NMC had given less priority and sanctioned lesser development works in our constituencies. The curbs on development works ordered by Mundhe will affect mostly cement roads in our prabhags. We asked him to review his decision.”

The civic chief replied that cement road should not be the city’s priority. The NMC’s priority is to look after sewer lines, and proper drinking water, Narnawre said.

In his letter to Mundhe, Jadhav said that in the house of 156 corporators, BJP has 112 corporators and they are receiving complaints from citizens on various issues ranging from development works, mistakes in property tax invoices to water bills.

“Being a ruling party leader, I am receiving complaints from corporators and as an elected representative, it is our duty to carry out development works and provide basic civic amenities. Under Section 63 of Maharashtra Municipal Corporation Act, it is the prime responsibility of the civic administration to ensure better amenities to the citizens,” Jadhav’s letter said.

The pending works and poor revenue collection show the administration’s apathy towards their prime duties. Jadhav also stressed on the need to resolve complaints of citizens pertaining to incorrect property tax invoices and water bills. “Even the civic chief’s Janata Darbar is receiving similar complaints, so I have requested him to spare time to meet all 112 BJP corporators to discuss these issues,” Jadhav told TOI.

Despite the financial crisis and Mundhe’s restriction to float new tenders for development works until the condition improves, the standing committee on Friday okayed two project proposals before it, including one to appoint a project management consultant (PMC) for beautification of Sakkardara lake.

Standing committee chairman Pradip Pohane said, “The PMC for beautification of Sakkardara lake will cost Rs16.71 lakh, out of state government fund of Rs8.35 crore.” Though the civic chief has stalled all works, whether or not work orders were issued, the standing committee also gave the nod to entrust M/s Santosh R Khaparkar to construct cement road under Phase-III project at a cost of Rs5.77 crore.

It also gave a nod to dispose of scrap from electrical department worth Rs97.62 lakh.

The tournament is an annual event organized by Chandrapur Municipal Corporation. Mayor Kancharlawar this year took charge of the event and decided to grant the honour of inauguration to former Union minister Hansraj Ahir, while former state finance minister Sudhir Mungantiwar was named as president of the inaugural function.

She allegedly overruled the invitation prepared by the CMC officials as per protocol claiming that mayor has all the powers to decide in the corporation.

The invitation merely mentioned Wadettiwar as prominent attendee. Irked over this, he dashed off a letter to collector alleging breach of protocol by the mayor. Later, Wadettiwar told media persons that if mayor goes ahead with the same invitation, then cost of the event should be recovered from her, as government funds cannot be spent on programmes where protocol is breached.

Jorgewar too objected to the breach of protocol as he was not consulted before deciding the tournament dates and printing invitations. The MLA’s Young Chanda Brigade has submitted a memorandum to collector demanding action against the mayor. City Congress too protested the move and demanded to register criminal offence against Kancharlawar.

Collector Kunal Khemnar ratified that there is breach of protocol on two counts in the invitations of both inaugural as well as prize distribution programme of the tournament. “As per protocol norms, CMC is bound to ask local minister, MP and MLAs for their dates and time while deciding to hold such events and they have to be given prominent place in the programme. The invitation printed by the CMC violates both the norms. I have directed CMC commissioner Sanjay Kakade to change the invitations,” he said.

“CMC commissioner has explained that the invitation was prepared as per protocol, but the mayor on her own changed it,” said the collector.

He, however, clarified that there is no provision for registering criminal offence against political functionaries in such cases. “If anybody feels that the breach of protocol is serious and offensive, (s)he can approach court seeking action against such politicos,” said Khemnar.

JAIPUR: Urging the Centre to withdraw the contentious amended Citizenship Act to maintain peace and harmony in the country, chief minister Ashok Gehlot on Friday said that like many others he was not aware of the birthplace of his parents and could land in a detention centre.In a surprise move late in the evening, Gehlot reached Shahid Smarak— the city’s Shaheen Bagh where anti-CAA/NRC protesters have been staging round-the-clock dharna from February 1— and addressed the gathering.The chief minister claimed that information on birthplaces of parents was being sought for the National Population Register (NPR).“If I am not able to furnish the details, I too would be asked to live in a detention centre. But stay assured, if such situation comes then I would be the first to go there,” Gehlot told the protesters.He demanded the NDA government to “reconsider the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA), which is against the spirit of the Constitution, and come forward to withdraw it so that peace and harmony can be maintained”.He assured protesters that the Congress and the state government were with them and, if required, he would be the first to go to a detention centre.He said the BJP government in Assam has refused to implement the National Register of Citizens ( NRC ).“It is the right of a government to make a law, but a government should rule as per the sentiments of the people. Like Delhi's Shaheen Bagh, protests are being held at many places across the country, including Rajasthan . The government should understand public sentiments,” he said.Several states were against CAA and have passed resolutions in assemblies.

Jyotiraditya Scindia

BHOPAL: AICC general secretary Jyotiraditya Scindia took his party by surprise by vowing to hit the streets if promises made to guest teachers in the Congress Vachan Patra aren’t fulfilled. Chief minister Kamal Nath , who is in Delhi, shot back that manifesto is “for five years, not five months”.

Scindia — who has often been openly critical of the Nath government, targeting it on crop loss survey and farm loan waiver earlier — expressed solidarity with contract teachers, who are agitating against the state government for over 60 days, demanding regularization.

Addressing a rally in Niwadi district of MP on Thursday, Scindia said: “Your demand was included in the Congress manifesto. And the manifesto is sacred text for us. If all the promises in the manifesto are not fulfilled, do not think you are alone. Jyotiraditya Scindia will also hit the streets with you.” Asking the protesters to be a little patient, he added: “It has been a year for the government. Teachers have to be a little patient. Our turn will come, and if not, then I assure you that I will be your shield and sword.”

In Delhi, when mediapersons asked CM Nath about Scindia’s comment, he said: “The manifesto is for five years. It’s not for five months.”

Nath met AICC chief Sonia Gandhi in the evening. Agencies quoted him as saying: “I have met the party president and discussed how much the government in the state has been able to fulfil the Vachan Patra (manifesto).” CM Nath’s spokesperson in Pradesh Congress, Narendra Saluja said he spoke to the party president on organizational issues. “He also apprised her on the steps taken by his government for public welfare and promises made to people of Madhya Pradesh in Vachan Patra that have been fulfilled. He also delivered a report card of his government to the party president,” said Saluja.

Cooperatives and GAD minister Govind Singh urged Scindia “not to hit the road”. “Jyotiraditya Scindia is a state leader and there is no need for him to do so. I suggest Scindia should discuss the issue with the chief minister in view of the financial situation of the state,” he told mediapersons in Bhopal, adding that guest teachers were “not appointed to be made regular”. “It was a temporary post. They can be regularized only if they follow the rules,” he said.

Scindia has been touring parts of the state in the last 24 hours, addressing rallies organized by supporters. On Thursday, he had called the Delhi poll rout “very, very disappointing”, and suggested that Congress needs to “reinvent itself with new ideology”. After Scindia lost the 2019 Lok Sabha election from Guna, his supporters have been demanding that he be appointed PCC chief, a post that AICC has asked Nath to hold even after he became chief minister.

Public is god, can bring a neta to the ground: Scindia

Bhopal: Almost 10 months after he lost the Guna Lok Sabha seat, AICC general secretary Jyotiraditya Scindia expressed his feelings on his defeat. At a rally organized by his supporters in Ashoknagar, MP, on Friday, Scindia said “Janata (public) as the biggest god”. “The public can make a common man a leader, and bring a neta to the ground. I have this realization as I stand on the ground. I want to remain grounded, remain close to the roots, as well as to stay in your heart,” he said.

Jaipur: Pulwama martyr Rohitash Lamba’s brother has claimed that the state government has still not fulfilled many of the promises made to the family a year back. The promises included naming a public place after the martyr’s name.

Lamba’s brother said that despite repeated reminders to the state government, nothing has been done. Coincidentally the martyr’s brother was blessed with a baby boy on Friday and was named Rohitash.

The martyr’s brother Jeetendra told TOI, “While the monetary compensation was given to us, the other promises including naming a public place in my brother’s and giving a government job to his next of kin are yet to be fulfilled. The ministers just came at the time of my brother’s death to get photographs clicked and despite reminders, the promises remain unfulfilled.”

The 27-year-old soldier was martyred when a suicide bomber in a vehicle loaded with explosives drove straight into a bus ferrying CRPF jawans in Pulwama on February 14, 2019. In this terrorist attack, 40 jawans were martyred. This included five jawans from Rajasthan. The families had been given Rs 50 lakh compensation by the state government.

“My brother’s loss still continues to affect the family and this was the reason when my son was born on Friday morning, we decided to name him Rohitash. This would always keep my brother’s memory alive. We just hope that the government fulfils its promises,” added Jeetendra.

Uttarkashi: Ratan Singh’s Divyang Pension got stopped unexpectedly in 2016. Since then he had been complaining to different local authorities asking to restart Rs 1,000 per month pension but no one looked into the matter. After four years of inaction of local officials, Singh, a resident of Satudi village in Mori block of Uttarkashi district, visited the district collectorate office, but only to be shocked.

Singh (47) found out that he was declared dead in the official records in 2016 and subsequently, his pension had been stopped. Thereafter, he approached Uttarkashi district magistrate Ashish Chauhan, who later set up an inquiry to resolve the issue and ordered the concerned department to restart crediting the pension to his post office account.

Singh claimed that he was a recipient of the pension amount since 2005, when the scheme was launched, but credit of the amount to his account got stopped in 2016. He adds that a few weeks ago, officials at social welfare department office in Uttarkashi had also told him that he was “dead” as per official records but the information only got confirmed after he visited the collectorate office last Wednesday.

Meanwhile, district’s social welfare officer DD Arya told TOI, “According to our findings, the villager got regular pension till March 2018. We will credit the due pension amount in his account at the earliest and restart monthly payment. We will also investigate the issue and take required action to fix such loopholes.”

Kochi: Students Federation of India (SFI) and the Kerala Students Union (KSU) activists clashed on the Government Law College campus allegedly over Valentine’s Day celebrations on Friday afternoon. Several students sustained grievous injuries. The college will remain closed till February 24.

College principal T G Ajitha said that an internal inquiry committee has been constituted to look into the incident. “It was a minor argument, seemingly following Valentine’s Day celebrations, which was resolved following intervention of the faculty. A second clash broke out later on and it was over by the time faculty reached the spot,” said Ajitha.

Despite the ongoing valuation camp, classes were convened to help students. “Now, with this event, it would be better to remain closed till things settle down. Also, teachers are busy with the valuation camp, so the college will now reopen on February 24,” said the principal.

Ajitha said she visited the students who are admitted in hospital and some of them have sustained substantial injuries. Both student organizations approached central police and officers said cases would be registered against both sets of students. KSU activists have been accused of sabotaging a cultural programme organized by the SFI-led union in view of Valentine’s Day and an event to pay tributes to victims of the Pulwama terror attack of 2019. “KSU activists held a ‘eating competition’ when the union programme was going on. This led to an argument which got resolved soon. Later, non-student Youth Congress activists entered the campus and beat up union members,” an SFI activist alleged.

He said that a university union councillor suffered head injuries, the nature club secretary sustained a broken nose and arm and that three SFI activists are admitted in hospital.

K M Anas, district general secretary, KSU, said it was SFI activists who had gone on the rampage. “We had organized eating competition after the programme organized by SFI. They created the ruckus to vent their frustration over the failure of the programme. Five of our activists are in hospital with injuries,” he said.

Jaipur: A nine-month-old infant girl was locked inside a house for nearly seven hours by the representatives of a private finance company before she was rescued at Kasya Ki Dhani hamlet under Roopangarh sub-division of Pushkar in Ajmer.

This ‘criminal act’ was brought to notice during Zero Hour by Suresh Rawat, BJP legislator from Pushkar, who also presented the infant as proof in the assembly on Friday.

The MLA claimed that the infant was rescued only after the intervention of district collector and demanded the government to lodge a case of murder attempt against the employees of the private finance company and local police. Addressing the media with the infant in his lap, Rawat said, “We are not against action by a finance company if instalment of any loan or dues are not paid. But, I have only drawn attention to the issue of an infant being locked inside her own house in presence of police and, that too, when her parents kept pleading with them.”

He claimed that the incident took place at 11am on Thursday and the girl was rescued after district collector’s intervention at 7.30pm in the evening.

“What is more shocking in this case is that the sealing of the house was also illegal as the family had already got a court stay in this regard,” he claimed.“I have demanded strict action so that in future nobody dares to repeat it,” he added.

In the evening parliamentary affairs minister Shanti Dhariwal assured the House that a senior police officer would investigate the matter. “She remained locked for three to four hours. We will get the matter investigated by a senior police officer,” he said.

Kochi: In an unusual order, a single bench of the high court on Friday ordered an IAS officer to plant 100 trees in a forest for not implementing its earlier order.

Industries department director K Biju was ordered to plant 100 trees by Justice Amit Rawal in a case where repeated orders issued by the HC were not implemented on a complaint that was filed over 20 years ago.

The court has asked the IAS officer to consult with the forest department to decide the place for planting the trees. The court has also ordered that disciplinary action should be taken against all the officials who had caused the delay on the complaint. After taking disciplinary action, report should be filed before the court, the judge ordered.

The order was issued in a petition filed by a small-scale industrial unit named SS Chemicals. Though the firm was initially granted exemption from sales tax, it was cancelled by the industries department in November 1999. The department had found the reason that the product being manufactured by the company is not included in the list of products eligible for exemption. Though the firm approached a state-level appellate committee against the decision, the appeal was dismissed. Following this, the company approached the high court.

After considering the plea, the high court quashed the order of the industries department declining exemption and asked it to reconsider the matter. When the decision by the industries department was again not favourable, the company approached the state-level appellate committee once again. While the appeal was pending, the company was asked to pay sales tax from 1996 to 2002. When the company approached the high court challenging this, government assured the court that the appeal before the state-level committee would be considered soon. The court directed for finalizing the appeal within two months and stayed the action to levy tax, while asking the company to furnish a security of Rs5 lakh.

When no decision came from the state-level appellate committee even after 10 years, the company approached the high court again. Citing RTI document, the company pointed out that no hearing on the appeal has been scheduled yet.

Considering the company’s petition, the court ordered the industries director to appear before it in person and issued the order for planting trees as punishment for the delay.

433,['15/02/2020'],Plan to buy a flat? Check if your area falls in ‘black’ zone,"This story is from February 15, 2020

Visakhapatnam: Next time you intend to purchase a new property and want to make it your permanent home, make sure you have gone through all the fact-checks properly. For, several banks have adopted a policy against sanctioning unsecured loans at some pin codes in the city and you might find your application for a new credit card or personal loan getting rejected.

K Raju, who bought a new flat in Madhurwada locality last year, was in for a shock when he tried to apply for a new credit card. “To my utter surprise, the private bank rejected my credit card application. I was told the bank can’t service the locality under my pin code,” the 39-year-old private sector employee said.

When TOI tried to apply for a personal loan and credit card on the website of a few private banks, it was found that the banks were reluctant to give loans or credit cards to a few specific pin codes. While applying online, the applicant needs to fill up his or her home address on the personal profile section. Once Visakhapatnam is typed in the specific ‘city’ column, the websites automatically generate the pin codes and the applicants need to select their area’s pin code from the scroll down button. However, the ‘unserviceable’ areas’ pin codes can’t be found in the list.

“Yes, banks often restrict unsecured loans depending on the locality where the applicant is residing. However, different banks have different restricted zones. We first check if the bank has any restrictions in the pin code area where our customer is residing before going ahead with the application,” said B Ganesh, owner of a DSA agency.

A senior official in the credit department of a private bank said ‘redlining’ of some areas exist in almost all Indian cities. “We redline only those areas where our credit realization is very poor. There are some neighbourhoods where our officials fear to enter. It’s difficult to track loan defaulters staying in those areas,” he explained.

Earlier, such system of rejection never used to come to light because bank officials never used to reveal the exact reason behind the rejection of loan applications. But with the increase in online applications, they are now bound to remove the restricted pin codes from the system to avoid ‘wastage’ of both time and money. “However, in some cases we give exemption if the applicant has a salary account with us, or if we have a corporate relationship with the employer, or if the applicant wants a loan against fixed deposits or other investments,” another private bank official revealed.

The legal fraternity, when asked for their reaction, said this is a new trend and very few bother to check this aspect when buying a new property. “But this is not a healthy trend. Normally, a home buyer checks the area and papers related to the property. Why should one check this aspect? As the city is expanding, many residential projects are coming up on the outskirts. Many people are buying properties in such complexes and staying there permanently. Such a policy by the banks is not right. You cannot judge an individual on the basis of his or her locality,” K Murlidhar, a senior advocate, opined.

434,['15/02/2020'],"Simultaneous elections to GVMC, local bodies likely","This story is from February 15, 2020

Visakhapatnam: If things go the way they seem, the state government may hold simultaneous elections for local bodies and GVMC (Greater Visakhapatnam Municipal Corporation). Moreover, the state cabinet decided to amend the Andhra Pradesh Panchayati Raj Act, the AP Municipal Act and the AP Municipal Corporations Act on February 12 to disqualify candidates indulging in electoral malpractices.

It is being projected that candidates will have a maximum of seven days to campaign and the entire election process will be completed once the notification is issued. The state government plans to get done with the elections by March 15. The hurry to finish of the local bodies’ polls is because of several reasons including examinations, new financial year and the budget sessions in the state assembly.

The GVMC has lost over Rs 300 crore in basic and performance grants under the 14th finance commission over the last three fiscals because it did not have an elected council. The Union government has made it clear that grants under the 14th finance commission cannot be released to civic bodies where there are no elected members.

No elections have been held in the GVMC since the term of the council ended in 2012. Further, four cases are pending in court on ward delimitation and merger of new villages among other issues. It is expected that the cases will be disposed over the next few days.

Speaking to TOI, GVMC commissioner G Srijana said that the civic body is largely ready for the elections with the exception of having finalised ward-wise reservations. “A notification pertaining to ward delimitation has already been published. The GVMC has also notified polling stations and published voter lists. It will take two to three days to finalise the reservations after receiving the official guidelines,” she said.

Speaking on the housing scheme for the poor and its implementation, the GVMC commissioner said that a total of 1.76 lakh beneficiaries have been found eligible for the scheme within the GVMC limits. “We received around 11,000 applications that are being screened during Spandana programme,” Srijana said.

GVMC chief G Srijana (right) releases poster for citizen perception survey

Visakhapatnam: Visakhapatnam is one of the first cities to complete the data uploading exercise for the ‘ Ease of Living ’ index and the municipal performance index, said GVMC commissioner G Srijana on Friday.

Speaking to the media, Srijana said that the Union ministry of housing and urban affairs had launched these two frameworks to assess quality of life of citizens in 100 smart cities and 14 other ‘million plus’ cities.

The GVMC commissioner further said that the citizen perception survey is a major component of the ease of living index which has 30 per cent weightage. Data provided by the civic body will have 70 per cent weightage, she informed. “We request residents to participate in the survey and submit their feedback,” the GVMC commissioner appealed.

According to Srijana, the survey seeks to get feedback from nearly 20,000 city residents about infrastructure, service delivery and quality of life. The online survey began on February 1 and will continue till February 29. The GVMC has collected responses from 4,000 people yet, informed Srijana.

Talking about the municipal performance index, she said that it seeks to assess the sector-wise performance of municipal bodies across five verticals. “While the ease of living index data assessment covers the entire city, including the private sector, data assessment under the municipal performance index will be largely limited to the civic body,” she said. The civic body chief said that GVMC and the Greater Visakhapatnam Smart City Corporation Limited have taken up various IEC activities and teams are visiting institutions to make different stakeholders a part of the survey. She further informed that Vizag smart city has been paired up with Diu smart city under by the Union ministry of housing and urban affairs under the Smart Cities Mission.

437,['15/02/2020'],City’s cure rate for childhood cancer is abysmally low,"This story is from February 15, 2020

Visakhapatnam: As cost treatment remains high and inaccessible to a major portion of the population, the cure rate for childhood cancer is abysmally low in Visakhapatnam.

In the developed world, the cure rate for common childhood cancers like lymphoma and leukaemia is over 80%. But in India, the cure rate is only 30%. City doctors said that the figure is around the same percentage in the city.

Speaking to TOI, Dr Nirmalya Deo Pradhan, paediatric oncologist at Homi Bhaba Cancer Hospital and Research Centre (HBCH & RC) said, “A majority of childhood cancer cases are diagnosed between the age group of 5-14 years at fairly advanced stages. These cancers are completely curable if diagnosed early and treated timely.”

Doctors feel that in order to reduce the number of mortalities in child cancer cases, diagnosis and treatment services need to be more accessible to families from all sections of society.

Currently, a number of the major cancer hospitals or those with requisite infrastructure are concentrated in big urban centres. Families who have a child suffering from cancer need to travel long distances to access treatment. This compounds the distress and anxiety, aver doctors.

“90% of the children with cancer get free treatment at HBCH & RC with the help of funds provided by the Union ministry of health and family welfare,” added Pradhan.

One other problem with regard to childhood cancer is that a child coping with cancer needs physical, mental and emotional support. Simply putting them on treatment is not enough.

Cancer treatment is often very long drawn out painful with children suffering from a number of side-effects. Efforts therefore have to be made to minimise pain. “Actually, in most cases, children with cancer do not require any kind of isolation from the family. The child can live a normal life,” Dr Pradhan added.

February 15 is International Childhood Cancer Day. The day is being celebrated all over the world to help create awareness about childhood cancer. “Together we can achieve the vision that ‘no child should die of cancer — cure for more and care for all’,” said Dr D Raghunatha Rao, director of HBCH & RC.

438,['15/02/2020'],"Greta and I fighting the same fight, says city girl","This story is from February 15, 2020

15-year-old climate activist Deepsri Peela outside the GVMC office on Friday

Visakhapatnam: Twelve weeks ago, 15-year-old Deepsri Peela from Visakhapatnam took to the streets in a call for action on the climate crisis. Every Friday since, the climate activist has attempted to draw attention to the issue by sloganeering and carrying placards, in an answer to the ‘School strike for climate’ movement started by Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg .

“I knew about the school strikes from the day Greta Thunberg started striking in Sweden. I knew that sometime in the year, I’d join strikers on this side of the world. Greta is an inspiration, but I am me. We are two different people fighting for the same cause,” said the climate activist.

When asked about the threat that global warming poses, Deepsri said, “The crisis is causing ecological breakdown and disturbances in wildlife. An ecological imbalance due to this rapid species extinction and endangerment is breaking our ecosystem. Animals that were once abundant and forests with which we lived in harmony are vanishing as we are ‘expanding’ our civilisation.”

Desertification, Deepsri said, has led to the extinction of the Indian cheetah, pink-headed duck and the Great Indian Bustard, but “how much do we, sitting in our air-conditioned rooms care about some species going extinct? Extinction means the wiping out of a species forever. It is the ultimate end and it hurts me that these beautiful animals are gone.”

India must take the lead in Asia to do this because India has taken the lead several times. We are a nation that is built on science. It will be an insult if we oppose the same science,” Deepsri said.

“Only when we first declare the crisis as such can we truly move forward and I would like Visakhapatnam to declare the climate crisis as one,” Deepsri said, adding that 1,034 jurisdictions in 19 countries have already declared a climate emergency. “I started to protest because it is the one thing I can do for my future self and to tell my children that on my part, I tried to combat the crisis,” she said.

While there are solutions to tackle climate change, an individual contribution can start with moving towards a plant-based food system that would conserve water, combat desertification and habitat loss, Deepsri said.

But even as Deepsri’s posts on social media gain visibility, there has been little action on the ground. On the official response to her campaign, she said the GVMC is aware while there is growing awareness among other sections. “The only support I wish for should come in the form of action, not appreciation. Until now, I’d received none. It’s not for myself that I’m doing this,” Deepsri said.
