1,['27/02/2020'],It is important for an art director to read the script: Santhanam,"One of the highlight scenes of Rajinikanth ’s Darbar is the stunt sequence set inside a Metro station. While even filmi folk were thinking that the team had actually shot inside a Mumbai Metro station, here’s the revelation — that was a set! The man behind this realistic set is production designer and art director T Santhanam . Even if his name isn’t familiar to you, his work might be. He is the man behind the sets of films like Aayirathil Oruvan, Irudhi Suttru and Kaaviyathalaivan.“The Vijayakanth-starrer Chokka Thangam was my first film as an art director,” begins Santhanam, who graduated from the Government College of Fine Arts in 1996, and assisted art director M Prabhakar for five years. He started doing ad films, and then got his break in films with the K Bhagyaraj directorial.Talking about the station set in Darbar, he says, “We had originally planned to shoot in an actual station, but given that we were going to shoot with a huge star like Rajini sir, we realised managing the crowd might be a problem, even in Mumbai. So, we got a shot of him stepping out of the train in an actual station, and then matched the rest with a set.”The planning involved extensive discussions with cinematographer Santosh Sivan and the visual effects team to ensure that the set came out as realistic as possible. “Lighting played a key role in matching both the footage. We put up pillars that are geometrically similar to the ones in an actual station,” says the art director.He completed the set in seven days with 200 craftsmen working on it. “I usually discuss the time I require to erect a set right at the time of story discussion with the director. With big-budget films starring big stars, time is crucial because delays will increase production cost. So, if you plan your schedule properly, you will be able to deliver on time,” he says.Rajinikanth, he says, is very simple on the sets. “He treats everyone with dignity. And he is very punctual. On the set, he will not discuss anything unnecessary beyond work. If he has finished his shot, he will remain on the set, reading a book or listening to music,” he praises. When working with a star, he says he will gauge their appreciation of the set the moment they enter the set. “If their eyes go wide in wonder, you can be sure that you have done a good job. And most stars ask for the art director and praise them in person. Rajini sir appreciated the set I had put up as his office,” he adds.It is important that art directors also read the script in addition to getting a story narration from the director, says Santhanam. “Reading a script is like reading a book, and it helps you imagine the settings better. You get into the mood and understand the backdrop of the film while reading the script. This comes handy while you design the sets. Be it Aayirathil Oruvan, Demonte Colony or Kaaviyathalaivan, I was able to capture the feel of the films mainly by reading their scripts,” he elaborates.One of his principles is to work on one film at a time. “I have lost a few films because of this policy of mine. I missed out on 7aum Arivu with Murugadoss because I was busy with another film, but now, I have managed to work with him in Sarkar and Darbar. The way he appreciated me and my work in his interviews, especially my tendency to be at the shooting spot and not stop with delegating work, made me feel grateful. It is essential for an art director to be on set during the shoot as it helps the other technicians make informed decisions in terms of props and backdrops,” he says. But ultimately, he says it is the director who deserves all the credit for a good product.Santhanam’s upcoming project is Karthik Subbaraj’s Jagame Thandhiram, starring Dhanush. “Actually, I am doing only the India-set portions of the film; I couldn’t work on it during its London schedule as I was busy with Darbar. I have worked on it for about 25 days. It had been an interesting experience,” he says.",entertainment,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74319065,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-1151434/74319065.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/tamil/movies/news/it-is-important-for-an-art-director-to-read-the-script-santhanam/articleshow/74319065.cms

The actor continues to be referred to as ‘chocolate boy’ ever since his co-actor and Kannada star Darshan called him ‘Cadburys’ in the film Navagraha. While Dharma has enjoyed the cute-boy-next-door image so far, he tells us he has been waiting to explore action-oriented roles. Looks like he has taken up the task quite seriously, as almost all the films he has currently signed up for are action-oriented. “I have been shooting for Khadak and Talwar , both of which are action-oriented films. It is not a conscious move, but I am keen to see how people accept me in this genre of films. As for Dil Se, it is a combination of both genres, as the character goes through phases. The story begins while the protagonist is a college student. It then progresses to showcase him in an intense avatar, which is going to allow me to explore something different.

4,['27/02/2020'],"We’d already won this copyright case, what’s the point in filing a case again, asks Rakshit Shetty","Social media was abuzz with news of actor- director Rakshit Shetty and music director Ajaneesh Loknath having been issued non-bailable warrants by a city court in connection with a copywright case filed by Lahari Recording Company. The case is related to a song in the film Kirik Party titled ‘Hey Who Are You’, which Lahari Recording Company claims is allegedly a copy of a song from the film Shanthi Kranthi, which the company holds the rights to. The company had subsequently filed a case against Paramvah Studios Pvt. Ltd., Rakshit and Ajaneesh. The warrants now, though, have been issued as a result of the respondents, Paramvah Studios, failing to appear in court. Rakshit took to Twitter on Wednesday to clear the air surrounding the issue. He tweeted, “I am talking for all three of us here. We had already won this case a year back and even received back our security deposit of 10 lakhs from the court. We did not make it a news then for good reasons...(sic).” “We have won the case in Civil court and the High court. What’s the point in filing another case on the same issue? Also the second case was filed six months back but none of us, including our lawyers, were informed regarding the same. Why (sic).”Lahari Recording Company has filed a case in which it has claimed that they have rights to the song Madya Ratrili in the film Shanthi Kranthi. Our initial stand was that the company has the music rights for the song. This song has been copied by Paramvah Studios Pvt. Ltd., and the team used it as the background score for the song Hey Who Are You in Kirik Party. We had initially approached the court to stop the release of the film. The judge did stop the release then in 2016. However, they (Paramvah Studios) said they will defend themselves and the judge made them deposit Rs 10 lakh in court, following which the film released. After this, it became infructuous. We have the right to claim the money from them. We also filed a criminal case, because it is a criminal offence to copy anyone’s music. Where is the proof that they have won the case? The judge was convinced that there was a prima facie case and issued summons to Paramvah Studio Pvt. Ltd., Rakshit Shetty and Ajaneesh Loknath to appear before the court on February 20. But they didn’t appear and when this happens, the court has the right to issue a non-bailable warrant (NBW) to secure their presence. The matter was never settled by Lahari or the other party and we are still on the stand from 2016. The case has moved forward and we reserve the right to claim damages.",entertainment,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74317326,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-181502/74317326.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/kannada/movies/news/wed-already-won-this-copyright-case-whats-the-point-in-filing-a-case-again-asks-rakshit-shetty/articleshow/74317326.cms
5,['27/02/2020'],Distributors want producers to delay OTT/satellite release of films,"The tussle between producers and distributors over the release of films on OTT and television is not new to Kollywood. A few months ago, we had reported about the release of Karthi-starrer Kaithi on an OTT platform while the film was still running in theatres. In fact, Kollywood fraternity was surprised when Kaithi, which was raking in the moolah in the box office, was released on a popular OTT platform on the 30th day of its release. Though a few exhibitors expressed their displeasure over the same, the film’s producer stood his ground.A month later, RK Nagar, which was lying in cans for quite some time, was released on another OTT platform, even before its theatrical release. Though the makers pulled it out soon from the portal, many had watched the film by then. Similarly, Rajinikanth-starrer Darbar came on the platform before the 50th day of its theatrical release and Pattas, starring Dhanush in the lead was streamed on its 31st day.Now, the Chennai Kanchipuram Tiruvallur District Film Distributors Association held a meeting and has passed a resolution, according to which Tamil films should be released on OTT platforms and private television channels only after eight weeks and 100 days respectively after their theatrical releases. T Mannan, secretary of the association, said that this applies to both small and big-ticket movies. He adds, “We will ask producers to comply with the rule while signing the agreement pertaining to distribution. If the producer releases a movie by himself, then the clause will have to be altered.”Sivakarthikeyan-starrer Hero, produced by Kotapadi J Rajesh, was out on OTT platform after a month. Rajesh opines that nothing much is going to change with this rule, and terms it “impractical”. He explains, “Several discussions have happened in the past regarding this issue. The new rule is unlikely to bring about a change. If exhibitors can provide a written agreement that they will screen films for at least 50-60 days, then we can delay the release of movies on OTT platforms. I’m sure all producers will delay or withhold the release of their movies in such platforms if distributors give an assurance. So, if that is considered an impossible thing, stopping us from releasing our films on OTT platforms is also impossible.”Leading distributor-exhibitor Tiruppur Subramaniam says that the above rule has been followed by Bollywood for a long time. “If the biggest film industry in our country can follow it without any confusion, why can’t we follow it?” he asks, adding, “This is something that distributors, exhibitors, and producers should together agree upon. Producers can’t claim that they are facing loss due to the current business model followed by producers and exhibitors. If their claims are true, how come Bollywood is functioning without any issues? They also say that early release on OTT platforms would curb piracy to a large extent. Every industry is facing piracy issues, not just Tamil films. But when other industries can comply with this format, why can’tKollywood do it?”Ruban Mathivanan, who owns one of the leading movie halls in the city, says he welcomes the resolution passed by the distributors’ association. He says, “For big-ticket films, people may come to movie halls for the theatrical experience even if it has released on OTT platforms. But they will refuse to go to theatres to watch small movies if they have the choice to watch it at home in a month’s time. At the end of the day, a producer has complete rights over his/her film. But they shouldn’t forget that 60-70 per cent of the overall revenue comes from theatres.”However, Mannan says that they will soon be organising another meeting with producers and exhibitors on this.",entertainment,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74319274,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-1114195/74319274.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/tamil/movies/news/distributors-want-producers-to-delay-ott/satellite-release-of-films/articleshow/74319274.cms

8,['27/02/2020'],Proscribed Crimean ministers’ trip to India during Trump visit riles US,"This story is from February 27, 2020

Crimea dy PM Georgy Muradov

Even as the Trump-Modi summit went on Tuesday, US authorities raised concern before Indian officials about the presence of top Crimean leaders in India, ToI has learnt.

The US pointed out to India that deputy PM of Crimea Georgy Muradov and finance minister Irina Kiviko, currently on a visit to India, were both placed under sanctions by the US in 2016 for ""asserting governmental authority over a part or region of Ukraine without the authorization of the Government of Ukraine"".

What seems to have aggravated US concerns is that not only the 2 individuals are under US and also, as a European diplomat told ToI, EU sanctions, they also landed here in the middle of the Trump visit. Muradov is of particular concern to the US as he's additionally designated for being responsible ""for or complicit in, or having engaged in, directly or indirectly, actions or policies that threaten the peace, security, stability, sovereignty, or territorial integrity of Ukraine"".

An Indian government source said that while the US had raised concerns, it had to be noted that both the ministers were here only on an ""unofficial"" visit and that no Indian leader or senior government official was going to have any meeting with them during their 2-day visit to India.

ToI had first reported about the visit of Crimean ministers on Monday.

Their visit though, even if unofficial, helps India walk the diplomatic tightrope with Russia. It yet again confirms that India will continue to stand by Moscow on the Crimea issue despite its ties with the US. President Vladimir Putin has in the past expressed appreciation for what he calls restrained and objective position of India on Crimea. The US maintains that Russia continues to violate international law on the Crimea issue and that it will go on sanctioning those who threaten Ukraine's security and sovereignty.

Few Crimean political leaders have visited India though since it was annexed by Russia in 2014. The head of the Republic of Crimea , Sergey Aksyonov, created quite a sensation later that year after he apparently managed to inject himself into Putin's delegation to India. The State Department had then said in a reaction that while the US was troubled by Aksyonov's presence in India, it was possible that India wasn't aware of his presence in Putin's delegation. The US had then also approached India for a clarification.

The 2 Crimean ministers arrived in India Tuesday and are visiting Delhi and Mumbai. According to the Russian embassy, the Crimean delegation is on a ""working visit"" to India

""Meetings with representatives of the Indian business and public circles, students and Russian language teachers were held in a friendly and constructive atmosphere as has been a tradition between the two countries. Opportunities with potential for the development of economic, trade and investment cooperation with the Peninsula were presented,"" said the embassy in a statement.

12,['27/02/2020'],Bigg Boss 13's Rashami Desai: Arhan is a closed chapter for me,"By her own admission, her journey on ' Bigg Boss 13 ' was nothing short of a roller-coaster ride. Rashami Desai , who took a while to understand the game and come into her own, had a rather tough stay inside the house, when she learnt about her beau Arhaan Khan ’s marriage and also the fact that he has a child with his former wife. Days after the reality show concluded, BT caught up with Rashami to know about the status of her relationship with Arhaan, her equation with other inmates on the show — friend-turned-foe-turned-friend Sidharth Shukla and Asim Riaz . Excerpts...Many people judged me inside the house, but I didn’t care as I was being true to myself. I am the only one who had such a tough journey on the show. I got time to take stock of the situation and also learnt about what was happening in the outside world through people who visited the house. I got to know what he (Arhaan) was talking about me and our relationship. On the show, he once said that unhone mujhe sadak par se uthaya hai. It was quite funny. Yes, there was a time when I didn’t have a house and was going through financial troubles, but I was never at his mercy. Those things hurt me, but I stood like a wall for him inside the house so that nobody could say anything to him. I have never spoken badly about him even after his exit from the show. I won’t say anything bad about him even now, because he is a closed chapter for me.Yes, that was one of the reasons. I thought main agar yeh show karti hoon toh usko ek opportunity mil jaayegi, but I had no idea that the situation would backfire.He tried to reach out to me via text messages. I, too, need some answers and will meet him. I didn’t know about his marriage and child. I haven’t even met his parents. I just know that he has three sisters and one brother. I am not aware of his two houses in Mumbai either. The gem business he talks about is owned by his dad. I didn’t expect him to hide such a big aspect of his life from me. It came as a shock; at one point, I contemplated leaving the show, as I wasn’t able to handle it. I realised that after one point, the game wasn’t about how I was dealing with other inmates, it was more about how I was tackling the situation at hand with him. I think it was a good decision to not leave the house, kyunki main baahar aati toh mujh par questions uthte ki I used him for the show. I don’t harbour any ill feeling for him even today.I believe that he used me emotionally. I don’t want to comment on other things at this moment.It was difficult because I couldn’t detach myself. You always wish for a relationship to culminate in a life-long commitment, but it was not meant to be. I have realised that I don’t need a man to take care of me, but someone who can understand and respect me as a partner. You learn from your mistakes. Failing in one aspect doesn’t mean you have failed in life. I made a decision and have moved on beautifully. I lost my father at a very young age and maybe, that’s why mujhe aadmiyon ki pehchaan nahi hai.I had trust issues earlier, too, but I don’t see anything wrong in it. Transparency makes a relationship stronger, but if the person isn’t ready to give you answers, there is trouble. There should be no reason to lie in a relationship. I have been an independent woman all my life, and I have taken care of people associated with me. I can’t trust everyone and it’s natural.Abhi, aapke aur mere beech mein jo mera bag hai usme hai mere ghar ki chabi (laughs!)Asim and I started talking in December. Before that, we would fight a lot. He took his time to come around and maybe, that made our friendship stronger. We understood each other well and he did things for me without making a noise about it. He is genuine. We became closer because of the situations we faced inside the house. We don’t expect anything from each other. I am just thankful to him for standing by my side.I am sure that four-and-a-half months ke baad usko meri aadat ho chuki hogi, aur mujhe uski (laughs!). Sidharth and I had contrasting points of view and differences of opinion, because of which, we would often fight on the set of DSDT. As I always say, he is like a 10-year-old boy trapped in a big body. Keeping aside our differences, we were extremely professional; he was cordial and cooperative on the show we had worked on. We just couldn’t stop fighting even after becoming friends during the course of the show (laughs!). Later, when the fights became intense, I decided to end our friendship. Aisi dosti ka kya faayda jisme aap apne dost ko nahi samajh paa rahe ho.No, we were not in a relationship then. Hamaare bohut jhagde hue hain 'Bigg Boss' mein, but towards the end of the show, hamaare beech mein ek achhi understanding bann gayi thi.I have been working for years and work will always be my priority. I will take up a TV show if I like the concept. I would also like to dabble in theatre to hone my acting skills and upgrade myself.

13,['27/02/2020'],Skull-breaker challenge is the newest dangerous viral trend,"Every now and then, a trend goes viral on social media and more often than not, it is life-threatening. The latest such viral trend is the skull-breaker challenge. In this challenge, three people stand side by side and the one in the middle (unaware of the prank) is asked to jump. As soon as the person jumps, the other two kick his legs, causing the person to land on their head and back. Videos of the prank, which take stupid to a whole new level, are being widely circulated on social media have understandably worried parents. Authorities in Indonesia and Thailand have already warned citizens against doing the challenge. In the desire to gain clout and go viral, people have often put common sense aside and taken such challenges, which have resulted in injuries and sometimes even death. Here is a round-up of all such viral challenges from the past years.This challenge encouraged users to accomplish certain tasks and eventually commit suicide. Since 2016, several cases of suicide, self-harm and attempted suicide were reported across the world which were linked to this challenge. In 2017, Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology of India called for internet providers to remove all links which directed users to the challenge. This was after suicides linked to the challenge were reported from Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra.Videos of people doing the viral Kiki challenge took the internet by storm in 2018. In this challenge, people would get out of a moving car, keep the door open and dance beside the slow-moving vehicle. The dance challenge was based on Drake's 'In My Feelings' hit song. Authorities in various countries including India had to issue warnings to people to not try the challenge since it is a safety hazard. There were various reports of people getting injured while doing the challenge, including one from Iowa where a teenager landed in the ICU after falling while performing the viral challenge.(left) The viral Kiki challenge, (right) Kiki challenge goes wrongThis social media challenge involves people partially inserting charger prongs into a socket and then inserting a coin or a penny in the gap with an aim to bring out sparks. The challenge caused fires and short circuits at various schools and houses in the US and UK. While there have not been reports of any person getting injured, two teenagers faced charges of attempted arson and malicious damage to property in the UK.The trend emerged after people got obsessed with a thriller movie by the same name. This challenge saw people doing day-to-day tasks blindfolded. As if it doesn’t sound dangerous already, a teen in Utah took the challenge too far when she decided to drive blindfolded and crashed her car. She was injured and faced charges for reckless driving. The OTT platform where the film released issued a warning to viewers that doing this risky challenge could result in hospitalisation.While this may not be a social media challenge, but attempts to gather more hits and likes on social media by performing dangerous stunts on moving trains or on railway tracks is another dangerous trend that has been around for a while. In 2017, we had reported how youngsters’ ‘daring selfies’ and stunt videos with trains led authorities to take action against them. Three years on, the craze refuses to die. On Feb 18 the Ministry of Railways tweeted a video of a man who was trying to record a stunt on a moving train and narrowly escaped death. The ministry urged people not to attempt such activities.Grab of a video tweeted by Ministry of Railways on Feb 18 urging people not to attempt stunts on railway tracks and trains",life-style,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74317461,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-180780/74317461.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//life-style/spotlight/skull-breaker-challenge-is-the-newest-dangerous-viral-trend/articleshow/74317213.cms

Govt will protect genuine biz decisions by banks: FM

NEW DELHI: Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Wednesday rapped state-run banks for lacking consumer connect and said often executives at the branch level could not communicate in the local language or provide details of government schemes.The minister’s outbursts at an event to unveil the next phase of public sector bank reform plan, EASE 3.0, were triggered by repeated customer complaints that she received from across the country. It was a rare tongue-lashing to PSB chiefs and top executives, reminding them that they had lost ground-level touch, something that they were always known for.“I am going to say things which won’t be music to your ears. But I am going to say it because we need to introspect. Today, when people come to meet me, there are often worries on how, at the branch level, we can be a little more friendlier,” Sitharaman said, while urging top bankers to revamp their operations and motivate staff at the branches.The remarks came amid a credit slowdown , which bankers have attributed to overreach by agencies on alleged fraud. Sitharaman once again sought to allay fears over this issue, saying the government will protect genuine business decisions and it had already put in place several measures to shield honest bankers. But she made it clear that banks need to move ahead decisively on loan proposals.“It has to be normal practice that those who want credit get it. Those who approach you in the branch and tell you their requirement, follow the prudential norms, but attend to them. Tell them why you want to give them (a loan), tell them why you don’t want to give. But tell them. Be responsive... I will give you easy access and I also request you to give the customer easy access and get back to being that proud public sector bank official,” the minister said during her 25-minute speech.She listed out several areas which required immediate attention to improve performance at the branch level. For instance, she said, there was over-reliance on data from credit rating agencies and credit information bureaus and branches no longer knew their customers well. “We have got credit rating agencies and agencies that rate different banking functions and therefore talk about the customer and his (credit) worthiness. But they are not advisory, they are only an indicator of what a customer is. Was there ever a directive from either the Reserve Bank or the IBA (Indian Banks’ Association) to say that you will blindly follow the rating agencies numbers? No.”Sitharaman suggested that there should be a “judicious mix” of personal connect with the customer and data. By ignoring that connect, she said: “Your goodwill is lost, your personal connect is lost, your assessment at the bottom level is lost… forgetting branch-level connect with customers has not done us good.”The FM also underlined the need to motivate branch staff so that lending can get a boost and government schemes can be rolled out without any hitches. “The RBI will come back and say you borrow from me at a much lower interest rate, much lower than the repo rate... I can go on meeting you but it will still not reach the customer. Motivation at the branch level (is required).”The minister also said often branch-level staff was not even aware of government schemes, resulting in poor implementation. “General gyan on government schemes is not like before. You probably have people at branch level not even aware of those schemes that are being implemented in that branch in that particular area. Let’s please do an introspection. It cannot be that the government wants to make sure there is inclusion, it cannot be that the government wants money to reach the poor but the instrumentality that is prevailing through which the money has to go just because of want of information is not able to move forward. It cannot be like this,” she said, urging bankers to find a solution, while recognising that they may be facing a manpower crunch.",business,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74328668,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-275767,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/govt-banks-out-of-touch-with-consumers-finance-minister/articleshow/74326621.cms
20,['27/02/2020'],"Sonia accuses Centre, Delhi govt of ‘deliberate inaction’ over Delhi violence","Congress Interim President Sonia Gandhi addresses a press conference (ANI photo)

NEW DELHI: Blaming the ruling BJP and the central government for communal violence in the capital, Congress president Sonia Gandhi Wednesday demanded that home minister Amit Shah resign from his post for his “colossal failure”. She accused the Centre and the state government of AAP of “deliberate inaction”.Addressing a press conference at the AICC headquarters, accompanied by former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, Sonia asked Amit Shah to answer what was he doing for last three days since trouble broke out in the city. Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra later led a Congress march to demand Shah’s resignation but was stopped midway by the police.Saying the “tragic events since Sunday have a history, design and pattern …. a well-planned conspiracy”, she said Delhi assembly elections gave away the plan as “BJP leaders made inflammatory statements clearly intended to create an atmosphere of fear and hate.” She particularly referred to the recent statement of Delhi BJP leader Kapil Mishra , albeit without naming him, “who gave an ultimatum of three days to Delhi police and warned that ‘after three days, don’t tell us anything’.”Priyanka Gandhi told reporters, “What BJP leader Kapil Mishra has said is shameful and the government not doing anything is even more shameful.”Asked if Congress feared that violence could spread to other areas like in Gujarat, Sonia said, “It is true that we fear that it may spread to other parts. That is why we have spelt out what needs to be done to quell the violence here.” She termed as “shocking” the silence of the leadership in central and state governments.The strong statements came after a hurriedly convened Congress Working Committee met on Wednesday morning to express concern over the violence in northeast Delhi and passed a resolution putting the Centre and the state government led by Arvind Kejriwal in the dock. It slammed the Delhi government for not activating the administration to reach out to people to appeal for peace.“After reviewing the situation, the CWC is of the firm opinion that what has happened in Delhi is a colossal failure of duty for which the entire responsibility must be borne by the central government and particularly the home minister and calls upon the home minister to tender his resignation immediately,” the resolution said.At the CWC meeting, Sonia is learnt to have noted that violence happened a few kilometres away from the home minister’s residence and during the US President’s visit. In what was a reference to the anti-CAA demonstrations, she said the right to protest was a citizen’s right and people were being targeted for holding views different from the ruling party.“Where was the home minister and what was he doing since last Sunday? Where was the chief minister and what was he doing since last Sunday?” the CWC resolution asked.During the discussions, a suggestion that the Centre should be questioned about not deploying the Army was shot down by senior leaders like P Chidambaram and Anand Sharma. It was felt that the demand would give the BJP regime a license to send Army anywhere in future. “Let us not set this precedent,” it was argued, according to a leader present in the CWC meeting.Priyanka told the meeting that the party should be seen on the ground. She said Congress workers should go beyond social media and visit people, visit hospitals if they cannot visit localities.Congress will meet President Ram Nath Kovind on Thursday and submit a memorandum on Delhi riots. While the party wanted to go to the Rashtrapati Bhavan after the CWC, it was informed that the President was busy with the visit of the Myanmar President.The CWC called for deployment of adequate security forces, formation of “mohalla peace committees” and posting of senior bureaucrats in the districts. “The CM must be visible in the affected areas and in constant communication with the people,” it said.In Video: Delhi Protests: Sonia Gandhi demands resignation of Amit Shah",india,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74326668,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-612476,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/sonia-accuses-centre-delhi-govt-of-deliberate-inaction-over-delhi-violence/articleshow/74326666.cms
21,['27/02/2020'],BJP rejects resignation call,"This story is from February 27, 2020

Union minister Prakash Javadekar (ANI photo)

NEW DELHI: Countering Congress president Sonia Gandhi ’s demand that home minister Amit Shah resign over the rioting in North-East Delhi, information and broadcasting minister Prakash Javadekar said the comments are “condemnable and most unfortunate” and rejected the call for Shah quitting.

Javadekar said Congress’s claims of neglect were far from truth as violence was contained to a particular area due to prompt action taken by Shah, who was continuously monitoring the situation with security measures ensuring that arson did not spread to other parts.

The minister said Shah was proactive in handling the situation and asked about Rahul Gandhi ’s whereabouts, saying “Where is Baba?” The BJP member reminded Congress that unlike the massacre of over 3,000 Sikhs in 1984, which was fanned by Congress leaders as violence continued for three days, Shah held meetings, encouraged cops and held an all-party meeting attended by Congress members as well.

He said Congress had a habit of politicising serious and sensitive issues instead of contributing to peace efforts. Javadekar said Wednesday is the first Balakot strike anniversary, which had also been questioned by Congress and the opposition party had similarly doubted surgical strikes against terror camps in PoK.

Also reacting to the Delhi situation, law minister Ravi Shankar Prasad said, “Tension in Delhi should end. Many people are spreading violence here. At a time when Delhi is returning to peace, Congress chief Sonia Gandhi’s remark is untimely. When peace is required then there should be no politics.”

Asked about alleged police inaction, the minister said be it political parties or people, one should wait for the police probe and truth to come out. ""We believe that police investigation will reveal the truth about who arranged the stones, who opened fire, who put vehicles ablaze and who have been instigating people for the last two months,” Javadekar said in apparent reference to the Shaheen Bagh blockade.

Saying that the demand for Shah’s resignation is “laughable”, Javadekar brought back the the issue of 1984 anti-Sikh riots as he alleged Congress has much to answer. “Those whose hands are drenched with blood in massacre of Sikhs are talking of success or failure in stopping violence,"" he said.

Javadekar said, ""Congress is asking where was Amit Shah? He took a meeting of all the parties yesterday, in which the leaders of the AAP as well as the Congress were present."" The BJP member added that such comments by the Congress leadership will only deteriorate the morale of the police force.

23,['27/02/2020'],NSD questions Suveeran over nudity in play,"This story is from February 27, 2020

THRISSUR: Onstage nudity is still too hot to handle. The National School of Drama (NSD) has now asked director Suveeran, to clarify the portrayal of nudity in his play.

NSD asked for clarification on the play, ‘Bhaskara Pattelarum Thommiyude Jeevithavum,’ staged in Puducherry on February 12, 2020. The play is based on Paul Zacharia’s novella, ‘Bhaskara Pattelarum Ente Jeevithavum,’ in which Thommy, a migrant labourer, becomes an obedient slave of his tyrannical landlord. The play had received wide acclaim at the recently-concluded International Theatre Festival of Kerala.

NSD had given a contract to Suveeran to stage the play at the Bharat Rang Mahotsavam (BRM) International Theatre Festival of India 2020.

Suveeran said the play’s protagonist, a slave, had almost always been naked. “He is clad in a torn dhoti. At times the torn cloth slips from his hands, exposing nudity. This culminates in the final scene in which he runs away totally naked,” he said.

The school’s letter said: “As per the law, nudity and obscenity are banned in public performances. It was also verified from the DVD submitted by you that while applying for the participation in BRM, there is no scene of nudity in the said play.’’

Suveeran, an NSD alumnus, replied that it was absurd to argue that rules of “public places” were applicable to work of art. “If nudity can enhance the total feel of the play, it can be used even for public staging. This is what I feel as a director. Incidentally, the play was staged at Puducherry in a closed place, before an invited audience,’’ he said.

Suveeran also dismissed the NSD argument that the DVD submitted did not contain nude scenes. “…the DVD submitted is for quality analysis. A play is not a mechanical imitation of the video documentation of its first performance. The organic nature of the play gives the director freedom to intervene and improve the performance in each ensuing stage,’’ he argued.

The director said it was a pity to explain such nuances to an institution like NSD, “which had a rich legacy of promoting experimental plays as part of its academic endeavours within and outside the country.”

Suveeran recalled that as a student, he was given highest marks for a play in which an actor was presented nude.

On February 4, 2020, the Varanasi lower court had held that since in the writ petition related to the dispute, pending before Allahabad HC, no interim order had been extended in past six months, the stay was deemed to be vacated as per SC ruling in ‘Asian Resurfacing of Road Agencies case’ and it can resume hearing. One of the parties in the case, Anjuman Intazamia Masjid of Varanasi, challenged Varanasi court’s decision. Hearing the petition, Justice Ajay Bhanot stayed the civil court’s order to resume hearing and fixed March 17 as the next date of hearing.

NEW DELHI: An Indian Air Force special flight carrying around 15,000 kg of medical assistance comprising masks, gloves and other emergency medical equipment departed for Wuhan, China on Wednesday.The same flight, a C17 transport aircraft, on its return on Thursday, will bring back approximately 120 people, 80 Indian nationals and 40 from friendly foreign countries.The development followed China’s approval to operate the flight which had been pending since February 13. “Strong expression of our solidarity with the Chinese people at this difficult time,” tweeted foreign minister S Jaishankar , while thanking IAF and Indian mission in Beijing for their efforts.The MEA said that this assistance has been provided in the wake of the coronavirus outbreak in China and the request by China to provide supplies such as masks and medical equipment. “PM Modi had written to President Xi Jinping on 8 February offering assistance to China in this hour of need as a gift. The medical supplies will help augment China’s efforts to control the outbreak of this infection,” it said.“The assistance being sent is also a mark of friendship and solidarity from the people of India towards the people of China as the two countries celebrate 70th anniversary of establishment of diplomatic relations this year,” the ministry added. The IAF flight will also bring back some Indian and foreign nationals from some of India’s neighbouring countries who have sought assistance in travelling to India “in keeping with PM Modi’s neighbourhood first policy”.India had earlier accused China of deliberately delaying approval for the flight. According to Chinese government sources though, there was never any reason to panic as Indian nationals in Wuhan were very well looked after.“The process certainly takes some time, with the aim to ensure relevant arrangements made safely and smoothly, reflecting the constructive attitude and humanitarian spirit from the Chinese side,” said a source.",india,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74326746,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-255522,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/plane-leaves-for-wuhan-with-15000-kg-of-medical-supplies/articleshow/74326741.cms
27,['27/02/2020'],Reply by March 18 on Mufti detention: SC to J&amp;K admin,"This story is from February 27, 2020

NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Wednesday sought response of the Jammu and Kashmir administration on a habeas corpus petition filed by Iltija Mufti challenging the February 5 decision of the government to detain her mother and former chief minister Mehbooba Mufti under the Public Safety Act (PSA).

A bench of Justices Arun Mishra, Vineet Saran and M R Shah told counsel Nitya Ramakrishnan to ask her client Iltija to file an affidavit stating there was no other petition filed in J&K High Court challenging Mehbooba’s detention under PSA.

“It is submitted by the counsel appearing on behalf of the petitioner that no other petition filed by any other person is pending in the HC regarding Mehbooba Mufti. Let an affidavit in this regard be filed by the petitioner by February 27. On filing the affidavit, as above, let notice be issued to the respondents,” the bench ordered and directed the government to file its reply by March 18, the next date of hearing.

Iltija had followed the footsteps of Sara Abdullah Pilot , who had filed a petition challenging detention of her brother and former chief minister Omar Abdullah under PSA. The SC is likely to examine the validity of Abdullah’s detention on March 2. She had said, “It is rare that those who have served the nation as MP, chief minister of a state, minister in the Union government and have always stood by the national aspirations of India, are now perceived as a threat to the state.”

Terming the fresh detention order of February 5 as a mala fide exercise to silence the opposition to abrogation of special status to J&K under Article 370 , Sara said, “The grounds of detention served on Omar Abdullah had no material particulars with reference to the date or dates, place or places, words uttered from time to time, immediately prior to February 5 and other necessary particulars to justify the fresh detention order.” Both Abdullah and Mufti have been in detention since August 5 when the special status of J&K was scrapped and it was divided into two Union Territories.

On September 5 last year, the SC had permitted Iltija to travel to Srinagar for a private meeting with her mother, who had been kept under house arrest since August 5, and told her that she was free to move around in Srinagar subject to requisite permission from the authorities concerned.

28,['27/02/2020'],Ironic that ‘global terror epicentre’ Pak lectures on rights: India at UN,"This story is from February 27, 2020

GENEVA/NEW DELHI: Describing Pakistan as world's leading exporter of terror, the government on Wednesday said Jammu and Kashmir ""was, is and shall forever"" remain an integral part of India. This followed Pakistan's call for intervention by the international community on the Kashmir issue.

Speaking at the 43rd session of the UN Human Rights Council which is being held in Switzerland from February 24 to March 20, Vikas Swarup , Secretary (West), described Pakistan as the ""epicentre of global terrorism"".

He called for decisive action against those who direct, control, fund and shelter terrorists, in an obvious reference to Pakistan, which is accused by its neighbours of providing safe havens to terror groups .

""It is more than a little ironical that a nation that has become the world’s leading exporter of terror and violence seeks to lecture others about human rights...

""Jammu and Kashmir was, is and shall forever remain an integral part of India,"" Swarup asserted a day after Pakistan’s minister for human rights Shireen Mazari alleged that India continues to violate the human rights of the Kashmiri people and demanded immediate repeal of all actions by India taken on August 5 last year.

India abrogated the special status of Jammu and Kashmir under Article 370 on August 5 and bifurcated it into two Union Territories.

Pakistan has been trying to internationalise the Kashmir issue but India has asserted that dilution of Article 370 was its ""internal matter"". New Delhi has also asked Islamabad to accept the reality and stop its anti-India rhetoric.

Swarup said the transformative changes ""wrought by our Parliament last August were meant to strengthen the integration of the state... It was intended to ensure extension of all progressive legislations passed for the entire country to cover this region, and to resume the pace of socio-economic development in the Union Territory of Jammu and Kashmir.""

Despite Pakistan’s best efforts over decades to destabilise J&K through externally-instigated terror and a campaign of canards and untruth, the situation on the ground is quite normal, he said.

""Most temporary restrictions - imposed solely to ensure safety of the people from Pakistan-trained terrorist attacks - have already been removed, political processes have resumed, telecom facilities have been largely restored, developmental activities are being undertaken at a rapid pace and there is access for all to education and healthcare,"" Swarup added.

He said schools, colleges and universities have resumed and regular examinations are being held. Hospitals, clinics and pharmacies are well-stocked and staffing is at full capacity.

NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court Bar Association (SCBA) on Wednesday condemned Justice Arun Mishra ’s praise for PM Narendra Modi at a recent conference and called on apex court judges to maintain judicial independence by refraining from making such statements or show close proximity to the political executive.

Mishra, who retires on September 2, had described Modi as an “internationally acclaimed visionary” and a “versatile genius who thinks globally and acts locally”.

Saying that it “expresses its strong reservations of the statement and condemns it strongly,” the SCBA resolution added, “the SCBA believes any such statement reflects poorly on independence of judiciary and so calls upon the judges not to make statements in future nor show any proximity or closeness to the executive, including higher functionaries.

SCBA believes that such proximity and familiarity may impact decision-making process by judges and may give rise to justifiable doubts in the minds of the litigants about the outcome.

The resolution was passed by circulation and not through debate in the executive committee. It was signed by president Dushyant Dave , vice-president Kailash Vasdev, joint secretary Rohit Pandey and treasurer Meenesh Dubey.

Though the resolution was agreed to by 14 of the 21 members, secretary Ashok Arora stuck a discordant note saying such an important issue should have been debated in the executive committee meeting and not adopted through circulation.

Without signing in either the ‘I Agree’ or ‘I do not agree’ column in the circular, Arora told TOI that he and many other senior executive members like Col R Balasubramanian, Arijit Prasad and A C Aggarwala as well as three-four women executive members sought a full-fledged discussion, but the president decided to pass the resolution through circulation, a process which he termed “unjustified and immoral”.

Arora said, “Dave is playing politics, sabotaging the cause of the Association. He is using the Association as platform for personal agenda and games. We will have to call for a GBM to get this sorted out.”

By another resolution, again through circulation, SCBA expressed concern over the law and order situation in Delhi. Taking note of the “failure” of the law and order machinery, SCBA resolved to take “appropriate proceedings in this regard before the court to get suitable orders to bring immediate normalcy in Delhi and to hold authorities responsible for the failure accountable”. This resolution was not signed by Vasdev and Arora on the ground that the matter is sub judice.

(Representative image)

MUMBAI: Morgan Stanley has picked up an equity stake in Ummeed Housing Finance in the company’s Rs 164-crore series-D funding round. Ummeed Housing is backed by Swiss investor LGT, which has acquired India-focused fund Aspada from Soros Economic Development Fund.

The latest funding round has been led by a fund managed by global investor Morgan Stanley Private Equity Asia, which acquired a minority stake in the company. Investment bank Avendus Capital acted as the financial adviser to the company on the transaction. Existing investor LGT Lightstone Aspada also participated in the round. This equity round comes on the back of the $10-million equity raised in September 2018.

Ummeed Housing set up shop in 2016 and is focused on the informal and the low-income segment, predominantly in tier-2 and -3 towns. The company is a new-age lender having built a fully digitised loan approval and disbursal process, which allows for a quick turnaround of customer requests.

Besides home loans, it offers secured business loans to the MSME sector. “This fundraising gives us clear visibility on the equity front before the next financial year. We will use these proceeds to further expand in new geographies and continue to strengthen our technology platform, with a focus on building state-of-the-art underwriting practices,” said Ashutosh Sharma, founder and MD, Ummeed Housing Finance. He added the company is targeting to double its assets to Rs 1,000 crore in 12-18 months.

“The housing finance sector in India has seen a liquidity crunch for most of this financial year, with stress in a couple of large housing finance companies. Fund raising from a credible private equity investor in the current environment signifies the trust the fund has shown in the company’s growth story and robust business model.” he added.

BENGALURU: The government plans to sell 2.5 crore shares, or a 10% stake, in public sector engineering consultancy company RITES valued at around Rs 745 crore through the stock exchanges as part of its disinvestment programme.

The issue comprises 1.25 crore shares (5% stake) with an option to sell an additional 1.25 crore shares based on demand. The floor price has been fixed at Rs 298 per share — a discount of 6% to Wednesday’s close of Rs 318.

Around 50 lakh shares (20% of the offer) has been reserved for retail investors. Institutional investors can place bids on Thursday and retail investors on Friday.

RITES, which comes under the railways ministry, will see the government stake fall to 72% or 67% post-issue depending on the exercise of the green shoe option.

In 2017-18, the RITES issue was oversubscribed 67 times in 2017-18 when the centre divested 12.6%. The brokers to the RITES deal are SBICAP Securities, Elara Securities and IDBI Capital Markets & Securities.

(Representative image)

BENGALURU: Paytm Payments Bank , which also houses the Paytm e-wallet, recently filed an FIR against 3,500 fraudulent numbers. The payments company said telecom players are “not doing enough” to counter the rising menace of online fraud, where consumers are duped via SMS and calls.

Paytm Payments Bank MD & CEO Satish Gupta told TOI that while telcos have acknowledged the issue of rising fraud on online platforms, they are yet to take adequate action even when complaints are filed along with the involved numbers. While other payments companies and online platforms are also facing the same issue, Paytm is the first firm to come out with an official statement.

“As a first step, the initial due diligence needs to be made more stringent so that telecom resources (bulk SMS and calling facility) are not provided by telcos to fraudsters. Further, if a complaint is filed against fraudulent messages/calls, the telecom service provider should be able to do due diligence on them and block such fraudsters immediately,” said Gupta.

Cellular Operators Association of India (COAI), which represents telecom service providers, however, feels it is compliant with relevant Trai guidelines for commercial communications and has taken necessary actions. “The complaint redressal mechanism is being duly followed by the telecom service providers and action is being taken according to the provisions of Trai regulations. The Trai complaint redressal mechanism allows individual telecom subscribers to make complaints to their service provider regarding any unsolicited commercial communication (voice and SMS),” said Rajan Mathews, DG, COAI.

The move comes after the Noida-based company had also shared data of 3,500 numbers with Trai, the home affairs ministry and cybersecurity agency CERT-In. According to sources aware of the matter, Trai officials recently held a meeting with lenders in Mumbai as many cyber crooks use their banking services to mislead people with promises of freebies and discounts.

A critical aspect of this matter is also what’s called SMS shortcodes, often used by cyber crooks. SMS shortcodes are essential tools to use the company’s name falsely to fool consumers. For example, one of the most-used shortcodes is Pytm, mimicking Paytm. This can deceive a consumer to believe the text is coming officially from Paytm. Gupta added telcos need to have stringent control on the issuance of shortcodes for bulk messages to companies.

Image used for representational purpose

KOLKATA: A SpiceJet flight from Mumbai to Guwahati made a priority landing in Kolkata around 9am on Wednesday after the pilot suspected fuel leakage in the aircraft. However, inspection later revealed it was a water leak that had triggered the false alarm.

The flight with 189 passengers and crew was flying around 100km north-west of Jamshedpur when the pilot contacted the air traffic control at Kolkata airport to report the suspected fuel leakage. The fuel caution light in the cockpit panel had suddenly started flashing, pointing to a possible problem in the fuel tank. The captain had loaded adequate fuel in the aircraft, but with still some distance to go for Guwahati, the captain did not take a chance. Kolkata being the closest airport, he decided to divert there and requested a priority landing.

The controller in Kolkata guided the plane in, clearing the way for the flight to arrive at the shortest possible time. The aircraft touched down at 8.58pm. However, engineers could not find any problem after inspection and declared it a false alarm.

“The pilots of SpiceJet B737 aircraft operated flight SG-6480 (Mumbai-Guwahati) and during cruise had observed the fuel caution light. As a precaution, they diverted to Kolkata. The aircraft landed safely and on inspection, it was found to be a false alarm. Instead, there was water seepage,” a SpiceJet spokesperson said.

The flight was cleared to depart at 12.42pm and took off for Guwahati with 183 passengers and six crew members.

PATNA: Altogether 81 mail and express trains either originating from different places falling under the jurisdiction of the East Central Railway (ECR) or passing through its jurisdiction have been partly cancelled from March 18 till April 2, due to non-interlocking (NI) work being carried out at Kiul junction under ECR’s Danapur division. Railways has set a target to commission Route Relay Interlocking (RRI) work at Kiul in the first week of April to streamline traffic operations.

ECR’s chief public relations officer (CPRO) Rajesh Kumar said that RRI, which is an advanced signalling safety system, was long due at Kiul junction from where a large number of passenger and goods trains pass coming from different zonal railways everyday . The new RRI device, which is successfully functioning at the Patna Junction and Danapur station, will be completed at a cost of Rs 85 crore, he said.

40,['27/02/2020'],Bihar government to get several ‘delayed’ infrastructure projects back on track soon,"This story is from February 27, 2020

People crossing busy Bailey road near Patna Zoo where state government proposed to built a foot over bridge on... Read More

PATNA: The construction of several delayed infrastructure projects , including foot overbridges (FoB) and underpasses, is likely to begin in the city in a couple of months.

According to road construction department (RCD) officials, the delay occurred due to reasons like lack of budget last year and incomplete bidding process.

The bidding process for different projects, including the FoBs in Rupaspur, Rajendra Nagar and in front of Patna zoo as well as two underpass escalators near Samrat Ashoka Convention Centre, were initiated last year to ease traffic and pedestrian movement across the busy streets.

A senior RCD official told this newspaper that the department was trying to ensure smooth vehicular movement in the city. “Bidding process for several proposed FoBs and underpasses are in the final stages. Construction works will begin soon after,” he added.

Bihar State Road Development Corporation Limited (BSRDCL) managing director Sanjay Kumar Agarwal claimed that the detailed project report (DPR) for two FoBs in Rupaspur and Rajendra Nagar had been made ready.

“The proposed FoBs will be built as soon as we finalize the bidding process and find a suitable firm to undertake the work. The construction work will take around six months. The FoBs in Rupaspur near the Jagdeo Path-Sheikhpura Mor flyover and another near Rajendra Nagar overbridge will be constructed utilising an estimated outlay of Rs 2.19 crore and 2.78 crore, respectively,” Agarwal said, adding that two more FoBs would be constructed near R-Block as the stretch witnessed heavy vehicular and pedestrian movement.

Similarly, a tender is being finalized for the construction of foot underpasses with escalator in front of the Samrat Ashoka International Convention Centre. The underpass, connecting the centre with Shri Krishna Memorial Hall, will be developed at an estimated outlay of Rs 11 crore.

“We have initiated bidding process for the construction work, which will be finalized in a month,” an official of the Bihar Rajya Pul Nirman Nigam Limited said.

FoBs will also be constructed at strategic locations on the New Bypass Road.

“The stretch between Anisabad and zero mile is one of the busiest roads in the city. Pedestrians also face a lot of difficulties. Hence, the National Highways Authority of India will construct two FoBs at the most crowded locations on the stretch,” said Agarwal, who is also Patna divisional commissioner.

PATNA: Unidentified motorbike-borne criminals shot at a sand trader while he was about to enter his residence at Mohammadpur village under the Paliganj police station area in Patna district on Tuesday night.

The seriously injured trader was identified as Chandan Kumar (35). He was on his bike and was about to enter his house when criminals opened fire around 9.30pm. Paliganj police station SHO Praveen Kumar Singh said that two criminals shot Chandan from close range.

“He sustained injuries on the right side of his abdomen and left arm. He was rushed to a private hospital in a critical condition where he had undergone a surgery,” the SHO said and added that after preliminary investigation, it had surfaced that old rivalry over sand trading was the reason behind the incident.

“He was initially taken to PMCH. However, family members later shifted him to a private hospital on Bailey Road. Police on Wednesday morning went to the hospital to record his statement,” he said.

The SHO said that once the police team returns after recording the victim’s statement, things would further become clear. “At present no specific name of any accused has surfaced. We are waiting for the victim’s statement to lodge an FIR and carry further investigation,” the SHO said adding no suspect had been detained in connection with the incident.

42,['27/02/2020'],Awareness programme against child porn will be part of Unnayan scheme: Bihar CM,"This story is from February 27, 2020

Bihar CM Nitish Kumar

PATNA: Awareness programme against child pornography would be made the sixth component of Bihar Unnayan Yojana (BUY), CM Nitish Kumar announced in the state assembly on Wednesday. Under BUY, information technology is being used for imparting education to students in middle schools through video lectures. Students are getting education in five subjects.

Referring to the large-scale viewing of child pornography even by school-going students, he said it had become incumbent upon “all sensible and thinking people” to take a stand against child pornography, as it had become a social evil even in Bihar and, accordingly, the state government had requested the Centre to impose a ban on child pornography.

“Earlier, the BUY was being implemented only in Banka district, where education was being given only in two subjects. But now, it has been extended to all middle schools in the state giving education in five subjects. Anti-child pornography awareness programme would be made the sixth component to wean away students from it,” the CM said.

Nitish also announced that the Bihar Industrial Incentive Policy, 2016, would be suitably revised and amended to recognize agro-based industries and food processing units as industrial ventures, warranting benefits and incentives as per the norms of the state’s industrial incentive policy.

The CM was giving the government’s reply in the discussion held on the vote of thanks on governor’s address to the joint session of the state legislature. He presented a detailed account of the work done and achievements made by various departments.

Earlier, the leader of opposition in the House, Tejashwi Prasad Yadav, initiated the discussion and moved an amendment, maintaining that the state government had failed to create employment and job opportunities for the youths of Bihar, which had the highest percentage of youths in the country.

For his part, referring to the ambitious Jal-Jeevan-Hariyali (JJH) campaign, the CM said 97,246 of the ponds, ‘aahars’ and ‘pynes’ and 14,308 out of the 20,448 ponds in the state were made encroachment free, and action would be taken in 6,140 cases of encroachment.

The CM also said biometrics would not be mandatory for the verification of the claimants of social security pension provided by the state government to the persons above 60 years of age. While the scheme is called Mukhyamantri Vriddhajan Yojana, biometrics would now no longer be mandatory, as there were cases of the old whose thumb lines/marks had vanished. “The physical verification of such claimants would suffice,” he said.

Nitish said 19 lakh persons had applied for the benefit. Of them, the applications of 14.21 lakh had been sanctioned and the remaining claims were being processed. He also said the government would provide Rs10 lakh to prospective entrepreneurs belonging to the extremely backward castes. Of the amount, 50% would be as subsidy and the remaining chunk of Rs5 lakh is to be repayable in 84 instalments.

Earlier, moving the amendment to the governor’s joint address, Tejashwi also attacked the government with regard to the deteriorating law and order situation, pointing out that it had also failed in creating job opportunities for youths.

He alleged that “afsarshahi” (bureaucratic power) had increased and “corruption” had become glaring, so that not just common people, but also the elected representatives were not getting proper hearing.

“My appeal to them (NDA ministers and leaders) is that stop talking in terms of 15 years each of Lalu and NDA rule. For, your government has given 51 big scams,” Tejashwi alleged.

Opposition disrupts question hour: The opposition members from RJD, Congress and CPI(ML) on Wednesday disrupted the question hour in the state assembly, seeking immediate discussion on the demands of contractual teachers and the government’s reply on the issue.

Speaker Vijay Kumar Choudhary adjourned the House for 15 minutes. The opposition members also created noisy scenes from the well of the House during zero hour and call attention questions, after the House met again at 11.35am.

Earlier, while RJD member Lalit Kumar Yadav, Awadhesh Kumar Singh from Congress and Mahboob Alam from CPI(ML) drew the attention of the Speaker to the adjournment notices that they had submitted for a discussion on the issue, the Speaker said they were not in order as per the rules of the House business.

Apprehending that their adjournment notices would be rejected, the opposition members from the three parties entered the well of the House and displayed placards and shouted slogans. Both parliamentary affairs minister Shrawan Kumar and road construction department minister Nand Kishore Yadav maintained that the opposition members did not have any sympathy or interest in the demands of the teachers.

PATNA: The state government on Wednesday announced Rs 4 lakh ex gratia payment to the kin of 11 persons, who died due to lightening and hailstorm in different parts of the state on Tuesday. The decision was taken after CM Nitish Kumar reviewed the loss of life and property on Wednesday.

A statement issued by M Ramachandrudu, additional secretary in state disaster management department (DMD), stated that the CM has also instructed agriculture department officials to assess the damage to standing crops due to the hailstorm and make payment of agriculture input subsidy accordingly to the affected farmers.

Patna Meteorological Centre on Wednesday said heavy rainfall occurred at Kesariya in East Champaran and light to moderate rainfall at most places across the state during past 24 hours. It stated that dry weather is expected in most parts of the state from Thursday onwards.

Private weather agency Skymetweather reported that some areas in Bihar recorded hailstorm activities in last 24 hours. “The reason for the rain was a trough extending from eastern parts of Uttar Pradesh to Bangladesh. Moreover, humid winds were also feeding moisture over the Bay of Bengal. Now, the trough is shifting towards north, leading to decrease in rain activities over southeast parts of Uttar Pradesh. The weather will become almost clear by Thursday over east India,” it stated.

The sensex has now closed below 40,000 for the first time since the fall after the Union Budget earlier this month. In the last four sessions, the BSE bellwether has lost 1,281 points.Fears of a pandemic persisted as hundreds of new cases were reported globally on Wednesday, including the first US soldier to be infected in South Korea. The World Health Organization (WHO) has also called for urgent preparations to be made in anticipation of a rise in cases. Additionally, markets were subdued ahead of the release of the GDP numbers for the third quarter on Friday. According to BSE data, foreign institutional investors (FIIs) offloaded shares, with net sales of Rs 3,336 crore on Wednesday. Purchases by domestic mutual funds and insurance companies to the extent of Rs 2,785 crore helped offset the selling by FIIs.However, sentiment turned around in the US with the Dow Jones gaining well over 300 points, or 1.2%, in early trades. In India, the rupee also firmed up on Wednesday to close 23 paise higher at 71.66 against the US dollar on expectations that the trade deficit will narrow due to cheaper crude and fall in imports because of the virus.Among the sensex stocks, Sun Pharma, Maruti, L&T, Hero MotoCorp, Infosys, ONGC and RIL were among the losers.

Other gainers included Hindustan Unilever, which has announced the setting up a new subsidiary, along with HCL Tech, Asian Paints and UltraTech. “Recent global developments indicate that the coronavirus outbreak could escalate into a pandemic, which is taking a toll on markets across the globe, including ours.

Kapil Dev

SURAT: The man who led India to its first-ever World Cup win – Kapil Dev – had the audience in splits with anecdotes laced with wit as he delivered his first ever convocation speech on the campus of Veer Narmad South Gujarat University (VNSGU) on Wednesday.

The Indian all-rounder was the chief guest at the 51st annual convocation of the VNSGU which was organized at the convention hall of the university.

Such was the enthusiasm among the graduating students and their parents that the entire convention hall was jam packed. Many students kept standing in the hall to listen to Kapil.

The cricket icon was so moved by the enthusiasm of the students, who were waiting near the doorway and outside the hall, that he requested them to come closer to the dais.

In a lighter vein, Kapil stopped the anchor and started the convocation address. “Leave something for me to speak,” he said amid cheers from the students.

Wittingly sharing his life experiences, he informed the gathering that he had never got an opportunity to take up formal education in any college but he had got a chance to sit on the dais due to hard work and dedication.

“Education should be enjoyment, not compulsion. If you don’t enjoy whatever you do, it serves no purpose,” he said.

He urged the students to search their hidden passions. “My daughter had once asked me what I wanted her to become. I told her that it was more important for her to know what she wanted to become,” he said.

Talking about the importance of forgiveness, he recalled Nelson Mandela’s quote which the South African anti-apartheid revolutionary had delivered after he was released after 26 years of imprisonment.

“Mandela was my hero, and I had even got an opportunity to meet him. After he was released from jail he had said – ‘I forgive all those who kept me in jail’. So, forgive and move ahead,” he said.

He also advised students not to copy anyone but become original in whichever stream they pursued.

Ending his speech with a sentence in Gujarati, the raconteur said, “Mane Gujarati Avde Nahi” (I don’t know Gujarati). I could have communicated much better with you (students) if I knew Gujarati.”

Poet Rajesh Reddy, who was the guest of honour, recited ghazals during the convocation, which he said was at the request of the university’s top officials.

Surat: Surat and south Gujarat’s shrimp farming is set to get a major filip with dedicated cargo services.

It was a big day for the shrimp farmers on Wednesday when Spice Jet’s first freighter aircraft brought in about 24 tonnes of shrimp seeds from hatcheries in Chennai and Vishakhapatnam. This was the first-ever direct consignment of shrimp seeds to Surat in all these years.

Until now, shrimp farmers faced a lot of hassles in procuring the shrimp seeds due to lack of direct dedicated cargo flights to the diamond city. The seeds have to first airshipped to Mumbai and then by road to Surat. Farmers had to face heavy losses due to high mortality rate of shrimp seeds in the road journey.

Official sources at the domestic cargo terminal said that the Spice Jet freighter will be operating thrice a week connecting Chennai, Vishakhapatnam, Surat and Kolkata. About 24 tonnes of shrimp seeds were off-loaded at the terminal, about 8 tonnes of general cargo was sent to Chennai from Surat.

Shrimp business is booming in the diamond city and other districts including Valsad, Bharuch, Navsari. From just 300 metric tonnes per annum of shrimp production in 2009, the production has crossed to over 45,000 metrics tonnes per annum in 2019. The annual turnover of the shrimp farming in south Gujarat is pegged at Rs 2,000 crore.

There is an annual demand of 500 crore shrimp seeds in Surat and South Gujarat region. About 70% of the shrimp seed demand comes from Surat and nearby areas including Olpad, Sayan, Mandroi, Ichhapore, Dumas etc.

Head of the domestic cargo terminal operated by AAI Cargo Logistics and Allied Services Company Limited (AAICLAS) said, “Shrimp farming is a big business in Surat and surrounding areas. The freighter service will be a boon for these farmers. In fact, city’s cargo business will get a major boost with Spice Jet’s freighter service. We have all the required infrastructure to handle the cargo including cold storages, strong rooms etc.”

Pradip Navik, vice-president of Gujarat Aquaculture Association (GAA) said, “It is a big day for the shrimp farmers. Now, we won’t have to depend on Mumbai for getting the shrimp seeds. We expect the shrimp farming will get a major boost in the coming days as the travel time from Chennai and Vishakhapatnam has decreased drastically”

Photo quote:

“The entire shrimp farming community is excited with the direct cargo service from Chennai to Surat. This will boost the shrimp farming business in the coming days and we expect the production to increase by about 10-20% due to fast delivery of the seeds.

Manoj Sharma, president, Gujarat Aqua Feed Dealers Association

We always suffered heavy losses during transportation of shrimp seeds from Mumbai. It took almost 10 hours for the seeds to reach Navsari. Now, we will get the seeds within couple of hours after they will leave the hatcheries in Chennai and Vishakhapatnam.

Surat: The Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) has served notices to the realtors of more than 70 buildings under 17 residential projects located in Vesu, with regard to the approach of the runway-22 on Vesu side of the Surat airport.

Official sources said that the DGCA has asked the building owners and presidents of the societies to remain present in the Deputy Director of DGCA office at Mumbai for the personal hearing under section 6 (demolition of obstructions caused by buildings and trees) of the Aircraft rules, 1994, on March 4.

Airport director, Aman Saini told TOI, “The airport authority had submitted the obstacle height details of the buildings to the DGCA. Before conducting the final hearing in the obstacles issue, the DGCA has asked the building owners and residents to remain present for personal hearing.”

Saini added, “The residents of few buildings had come to meet us in the office on Wednesday afternoon to represent their case. We told them that the matter is not in the hands of AAI as the final decision will be taken by the DGCA.”

The clearance of obstacles in the approach surface of runway-22 at Vesu side will pave the way for clearing the displacement of 615 metres imposed by DGCA. This means that the aircrafts landing from Vesu side will be able to use the full-length of the runway — 2,905 meters, instead of the current 2,290 meters.

Sources said that the survey of the buildings obstructing the flight path within 6.6km in the approach funnel of runway at Vesu had end in 2018. The buildings in all the 17 residential projects were found to have violated permissible top elevation and coordinates in the range of 12.36 metres to 0.56 metres in height.

The new fleet will replace the forces’ broken-down patrolling vehicles

PANAJI: Goa police ’s dwindling fleet of vehicles got a shot in the arm on Wednesday with the force inducting 44 brand new vehicles as part of an ongoing modernisation program.

The home department has sanctioned the purchase of 85 new vehicles, including motorcycles, for Goa Police.

Handing over the vehicles to Goa police, chief minister Pramod Sawant said that the government would continue to upgrade departments which provide direct service to citizens.

The new vehicles will replace old and dilapidated patrolling vehicles. Goa police’s existing fleet of jeeps and cars are either damaged beyond repair or have a tendency to breakdown very often. Officers of the force, due to the shortage of vehicles, had no option but to use their own private vehicles for official police work.

As part of its modernisation plans, a proposal has been moved by Goa police to the state government for approval, to purchase vehicles, which was long-pending with the home department.

Out of 85 vehicles sanctioned, the police will purchase 58 four-wheelers, while the rest would be motorcycles. It will purchase multi-utility vehicles (MUV), sports utility vehicles (SUV) and cars for the force.

Speaking about the seizure of drugs in the coastal belt and of an injured youth confessing on video of consuming drugs, Sawant said that he has already ordered an inquiry. “I have asked for inquiry in both the cases. Already one report has come in and we have also punished them,” said Sawant.

The chief minister also said that the government has decided to permit iron ore lease holders to export already extracted ore.

“We have already taken the decision that those who have been cleared by the Supreme Court will be given permission to sell the ore,” Sawant said.

KOLHAPUR: The seven-year-old proposal for setting up an industrial corridor along the Mumbai-Bengaluru highway is set to be revived. Deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar had ordered a technical and feasibility report for land in Satara district.

Pawar conducted a high-level meeting in Mumbai on Tuesday and picked Satara district as it is near Sangli, Solapur and parts of Marathwada. The high-level meeting was attended by industries minister Subhash Desai, Satara district guardian minister Balasaheb Patil, additional chief secretary Nitin Karir and a team of officers from National Industrial Corridor Development Corporation, a union government undertaking.

An official communication released from Pawar’s office said the final decision on the land in Satara district would be taken after the receipt of the technical and feasibility report.

The meeting, held in Vidhan Bhavan in Mumbai and presided over by Pawar, decided to float a separate company for the purpose. Maharashtra Industrial Development Corporation (MIDC) and National Industrial Corridor Development Corporation will have 51% and 49% stakes in the proposed company.

Union government has decided to develop two special zone along Mumbai-Bengaluru national highway. It will grant Rs 3,000 crore to the state government. Karnataka has already selected Dharwad district for special zone. Two states are expected to develop industrial zone at respective sites.

The proposal was moved February 2013 by the then chief minister Prithviraj Chavan. According to the proposal, Maharashtra government was intending to develop subsidiary corridors along the lines of Delhi-Mumbai Industrial Corridor to attract the investors in industrial and agriculture sector. The proposal had then suggested that Satara, Sangli, Kolhapur, situated along national highway 4, be connected.

The proposed corridor covers Maharashtra and Karnataka and is expected to be spread over 1,000 km. In Karnataka, it covers districts of Davangere , Chitradurga, Hubali-Dharwad and Belgavi. In November 2013, UK government had shown interest in developing the corridor much like the Delhi-Mumbai Industrial Corridor, which is assisted by Japan.

Sources in the industries ministry said that the government was keen on an area near Phaltan or Karad in Satara district. Phaltan is already being developed for industries and has water through canal. Karad is close to Sangli and Solapur districts and is in position to have ample water supply because of Krishna river. Karad also has air strip, which can be developed, sources said.

(Representative image)

MUMBAI: In a move that will increase access to direct schemes of mutual funds (MFs), Sebi has allowed investors to directly use the infrastructure of stock exchanges to purchase and redeem units directly from asset management companies (AMCs). Hitherto, investors who wanted to purchase direct schemes (without intermediary charges) had to go to the fund house or through a fintech platform like Paytm Money or Zerodha.

“While this move is in the direction of providing a level playing field to the exchanges, we will have to wait to see how this is implemented and plays out,” said Paytm Money MD & CEO Pravin Jadhav. “Dynamics of MF investing are changing fast with technology and, over the past months, we are already seeing investors switching even from AMC’s channels to us.” Paytm Money offers a platform for direct investment in MFs.

In 2013, Sebi had permitted MF distributors to use recognised stock exchanges’ infrastructure to purchase and redeem units directly from the fund or AMCs. Subsequently, in 2016, it allowed registered investment advisers to use the infrastructure of stock exchanges to purchase and redeem MFs directly.

Currently, fintech platforms — besides facilitating sales — also allow investors to compare performance of schemes and provide a host of information to users. It is not clear what kind of a platform the stock exchanges will build for direct MF distribution.

“The recognised stock exchanges, clearing corporations and depositories may make necessary amendments to their existing by-laws, rules and regulations wherever required,” Sebi said in a circular issued on Wednesday.

The sugarcane harvesters, most of them being tribals, have given a call for an indefinite strike under the banner of Majoor Adhikar Manch, a state level trade union in Gujarat.“There are around 2 lakh workers, almost all of them being tribals, in sugarcane harvesting in around 15 sugarcane factories in South Gujarat.

It has undertaken mapping exercises and held meetings at both source and destination where workers harvest sugarcane,” said Sudhir Katiyar, an advisor to Majoor Adhikar Manch.According to Katiyar, sugarcane workers come from a vast hinterland spread over 12 districts of three states. The exploitation of sugarcane workers is going on and their working conditions have not improved. “We have sent a list of demands to sugar factory owners, state level federation and labour department,’’ he said.Trade union leader Jayesh Gamit said, “Sugarcane workers are demanding a hike in wages of Rs 400 per tonne which, according to union leaders, is Rs 250 at present.

PATNA: In a huge relief for commuters, a newly constructed flyover near FCI godown in Digha has provided an alternate route to vehicles. The number of trucks parked on the two-lane road along the Digha-Danapur canal has also gone down sharply.

The flyover, which connects Nahar Road near Patipul Ghat with the approach road of Digha rail-cum-road bridge, provides direct connectivity to vehicles going from Phulwarisharif and AIIMS-Patna to the J P Setu.

Earlier, commuters on the 12.27km-long road underneath the Digha-AIIMS elevated road used to face frequent traffic snarls due to long queues of parked trucks. Similar problems were witnessed in other areas like Naubatpur and Phulwarisharif.

Traffic superintendent (SP) D Amarkesh told this newspaper that trucks were allowed to pass through the J P Setu only from 10pm to 5am.

“Trucks coming from AIIMS or Phulwarisharif take quite a few turns while going to the J P Setu. The flyover has, however, provided direct connectivity to those going to the setu due to which heavy vehicles take lesser time,” he said, adding that cops had also been deputed to ensure hassle-free vehicular movement.

Meanwhile, residents and commuters are happy with the commencement of vehicular movement on the Digha flyover.

Sanjay Kumar, who travels daily from Mustafapur to Sonepur, used to face regular snarls. “Going to office was hectic as I used to witness slow traffic movement throughout the stretch. However, with the opening of the Digha flyover for vehicular movement, I reach office early,” he said.

Phulwarisharif resident Abhilasha said, “It is such a huge relief to see no trucks parked on the Digha-Danapur Canal Road. Earlier, it would take me at least an hour or more to reach my college. The Digha flyover has not just eased traffic congestion, but also reduced travel time.”

Former Bihar chief minister Rabri Devi with her party and Congress Legislators

PATNA: RJD on Wednesday supported the demands of agitating contractual schoolteachers and sought the resignation of education minister.

Former CM and leader of opposition in Bihar Legislative Council, Rabri Devi, said the state government should accept the equal pay for equal work demand of the niyojit (contractual) teachers, who are on strike.

“The state government, instead of paying equal salaries to them, has been dismissing the teachers in an undemocratic manner. Their demands should be heard, so that the evaluation of answer sheets of Intermediate and matriculation exams would complete on time. The state government has been putting the future of thousands of students at stake,” Rabri told reporters on the Council premises.

Several opposition members protested and created ruckus in the Upper House over the niyojit teachers’ issue. As soon as acting chairman Haroon Rashid requested the members not to disrupt the House, chief whip Subodh Kumar of RJD and professor Sanjay Kumar Singh of CPI brought separate adjournment notices saying incompetent invigilators were deputed at several centres to examine the answer sheets of matriculation examinations. Many of them reached the well, pressing for a debate on the issue by ignoring the listed business.

The acting chairman, however, rejected the notice and took up the question hour during which most of the questions related to urban development and housing department (UDHD) were answered.

In response to MLC Krishna Kumar Singh’s question over slow progress in executing different projects under Bihar Smart City Limited, UDHD minister Suresh Kumar Sharma said Rs984.50 crore was allocated under the Smart City mission. Patna Smart City Limited (PSCL) has got Rs 380 crore while Rs 110 crore has been given to Biharsharif, Rs 312.50 crore to Muzaffarpur and Rs 382 crore to Bhagalpur, he said.

“Work is in progress on 16 projects under PSCL, including Integrated Command and Control Centre (ICCC), smart road, solar panels and Jan Sewa Kendra among others. Under Bhagalpur Smart City Limited, the construction work on ICCC is underway whereas bidding has been invited for development of ICCC software, smart poles and solid waste management plant. The projects which have been delayed due to some issues in bidding would be sorted out soon and work on those projects would begin in the next three months,” Sharma said.

He also assured that the encroachment near Buddh Murti at Kadamkuan would be removed in the next couple of months.

PATNA: Altogether 1.04 lakh CBSE students wrote the Class X English (language and literature) paper on Wednesday at 272 examination centres across the state.

Most candidates found the questions asked from the NCERT syllabus easy. “Language and writing sections were quite easy, but the literature section was very lengthy,” said Aman Kumar, a Class X student of St Karen’s Secondary School in Patna.

A Delhi Public School English teacher, Anju Choudhary, agreed that long questions may have been difficult for some students, while the writing and reading sections were simple.

“Students may find difficulties in long-type questions, carrying eight marks in literature section. One of the difficult questions was from Guy de Maupassant’s novel ‘The Necklace’, in which the students were asked to write about the characterisation of Madam Jeanne Forestier. There is not much content to write about. The other was from H G Wells’s ‘Invisible Man’,” Choudhary said.

Shivani Singh, a Class X student of St Michael’s High School, said the paper pattern was completely based on the sample papers issued by the Board. “All questions asked in the exam is from the NCERT book. Some questions were even repeated from the sample papers. Students who solved the sample papers found the English paper easy,” she said.

Suryakant Akela, English teacher at Loyola High School, agreed that the paper was easy. “Students who read all chapters sincerely will score well in English,” he said.

“I was quiet relaxed writing the paper. I’m confident that I would score better than expected,” said Prity, a student of Notre Dame Academy.

Karan Sinha, a student of Kendriya Vidyalaya Sangathan, too found the overall paper easy even though she admitted that she was nervous before the exam.

The CBSE regional officer (Bihar and Jharkhand) said the examination was held peacefully at all the centres without any untoward incidents. Apart from English, the Board also conducted the exam for Web Application and Media paper for Class XII students.

The domestic passenger traffic registered an annual growth rate of 36.6% in the period 2014-15 and 2018-19

PATNA: The civil aviation sector in the state has seen a growth of 35.6% in the 2018-19 fiscal as compared to the 2011-12 figures, according to the 14th Bihar Economic Survey 2019-20 tabled in the assembly by the state government on Monday.

The gross state domestic product (GSDP) of the civil aviation sector has increased to Rs 252 crore in 2018-19 from Rs 31 crore in 2011-12, according to the survey. About 40.61 lakh passengers availed air services from Patna airport during 2018-19, compared to 31.1 lakh in 2017-18, a jump of more than 30%.

The domestic passenger traffic registered an annual growth rate of 36.6% in the period 2014-15 and 2018-19 and aircraft movement increased by 31% during the same period.

Patna airport registered a 12.9% growth in passenger traffic in the first three quarters (April to December) of the current financial year compared to the same period last financial year.

According to the latest figures issued by the Airports Authority of India (AAI), the city airport handled altogether 35,13,060 passengers between April and December in the current fiscal against 31,12,896 passengers it handled during the same period in the previous financial year.

Bhupesh CH Negi, Patna airport director told this newspaper on Tuesday that there has been an unprecedented growth in both passenger and aircraft growth at city airport, which would likely to continue in future. “The AAI is continuously upgrading the existing facilities and building new infrastructure to cater to this growth,” Negi said.

He added: “The AAI Patna has been increasing the number of passengers facilities at constraint terminal building, including x-ray machines for the registered baggage, frisking booths for women as well and check-in counters.”

Freight movement at Patna airport has also increased by more than six times, from 1.04 thousand tonnes in 2004-05 to 6.32 thousand tonnes in 2018-19. The freight business has crossed the previous year’s volume in the first six months (April- September) of fiscal year 2019-20.

To increase the freight movement from Patna airport, the AAI is building a cargo complex at the airport premises. “I am sure that the freight movement will record a huge surge once we get a cargo complex,” the airport director said.

‘Rs 1,219 crore for new aiport expansion’: Deputy CM Sushil Kumar Modi on Tuesday said the Centre has sanctioned Rs 1,216.9 crore for the new terminal building at Patna airport and allied facilities.

“Darbhanga and Bihta airbases will also be developed under the Centre’s ambitious Ude Desh ka Aam Nagrik (UDAN) scheme, which is aimed at improving the regional connectivity,” he said.

Darbhanga has been added under UDAN II scheme and the construction of temporary civil enclave has been completed.

The rally is slated to begin at 10am

PATNA: CPI functionary and former JNU Students’ Union president Kanhaiya Kumar and several other noted social activists are to address the Samvidhan Bachao, Nagrikta Bachao Maha Rally at Patna’s Gandhi Maidan on Thursday. It is being organized by over 100 different groups under the aegis of NPR-NRC-CAA Virodhi Sangharsh Morcha to mark the conclusion of Jan Gan Man Yatra spearheaded by Kanhaiya.

The rally is slated to begin at 10am and likely to be attended by Mahatma Gandhi’s great grandson Tushar Gandhi, social activist Medha Patkar and Dalit leader Jignesh Mevani among others.

All India Congress Committee (AICC) secretary Shakeel Ahmad Khan, who is also one of the patrons of the morcha, said more than 3 lakh people were expected to participate in the rally.

“Tushar Gandhi, Medha Patkar, Jignesh Mevani and JNU Students’ Union leader Aishe Ghosh among several others have already reached Patna. We are expecting social activist Yogendra Yadav and actor Swara Bhaskar, but they have not confirmed yet,” Shakeel said.

When asked about the purpose of rally when the Bihar legislative assembly passed a resolution on Tuesday against the proposed National Register of Citizens (NRC) and allowing the National Population Register (NPR) exercise in state only in 2010 format, Shakeel said: “We are not satisfied with the resolution. First of all, it says nothing about the contentious Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA). There should be complete clarity on CAA as well. Besides, we do not know whether the Centre will accept such a resolution or not. Thus, we are of the view that the resolution is a mere eyewash for vote bank politics and we will continue with our movement and the rally,” Shakeel said.

On being asked about the political parties participating in the rally, the Congress MLA said workers of Left parties, Congress, HAM (S) and most of the opposition secular parties are expected to take part.

Security of Kanhaiya also remains a cause of concern as his convoy during Jan Gan Man Yatra had been attacked at nine places in 38 districts. “We have taken permission from the administration for the rally and hope all necessary security arrangements will be made by the district administration,” Shakeel said.

Image used for representational purpose

KOLKATA: A SpiceJet flight from Mumbai to Guwahati made a priority landing in Kolkata around 9am on Wednesday after the pilot suspected fuel leakage in the aircraft. However, inspection later revealed it was a water leak that had triggered the false alarm.

The flight with 189 passengers and crew was flying around 100km north-west of Jamshedpur when the pilot contacted the air traffic control at Kolkata airport to report the suspected fuel leakage. The fuel caution light in the cockpit panel had suddenly started flashing, pointing to a possible problem in the fuel tank. The captain had loaded adequate fuel in the aircraft, but with still some distance to go for Guwahati, the captain did not take a chance. Kolkata being the closest airport, he decided to divert there and requested a priority landing.

The controller in Kolkata guided the plane in, clearing the way for the flight to arrive at the shortest possible time. The aircraft touched down at 8.58pm. However, engineers could not find any problem after inspection and declared it a false alarm.

“The pilots of SpiceJet B737 aircraft operated flight SG-6480 (Mumbai-Guwahati) and during cruise had observed the fuel caution light. As a precaution, they diverted to Kolkata. The aircraft landed safely and on inspection, it was found to be a false alarm. Instead, there was water seepage,” a SpiceJet spokesperson said.

The flight was cleared to depart at 12.42pm and took off for Guwahati with 183 passengers and six crew members.

KOLKATA: The Kolkata Police top brass has issued an order to videograph all protest rallies in the city in the backdrop of the Delhi violence. Commissioner Anuj Sharma took to Twitter to ask netizens to be cautious as some “motivated people might try to create trouble by posting inciting material”. He also asked his men to increase patrolling and be vigilant on the ground.The cops stepped up their social media vigil and advised people not to share or forward unverified content. Officers said legal action will be initiated against all those trying to incite problems. Other steps that the cops have been told to follow while covering protests include wearing helmets on law-and-order duty, arranging adequate transport in case protesters are rounded up, arranging alternative routes for normal transport and procuring a good number of guard rails.Speaking of sharing offensive content on social media, Sharma said, “Some motivated people may try to create trouble by posting inciting material on social media, which may create law-and-order issues. Be cautious in believing and forwarding such items. We are keeping a constant watch on social media activities and legal action will be initiated against people who may try to incite problems.”The advice came in the backdrop of the recent violence in Delhi that has already claimed 20 lives. The Delhi incident has led to a deluge of videos, photographs, memes and statements — some of which might incite trouble — attributed to various people being shared on social media without any validation. “Some fake videos are doing the rounds,” an officer said.Sharma, who also took to Twitter to stress this message, received immediate appreciation from Kolkata residents. Some even promised to help flag such false and misleading content on social media. In two cases, people reported such posts to Sharma’s Twitter handle. The CP responded to one and asked the Kolkata Police cyber cell to probe the case.Cyber law experts claimed “transmitting and publishing” any misleading content on social media is a punishable act even if the “source” of the information is someone else. “The cases dealing with spreading intolerance and promoting hatred amongst communities come under specific IPC Acts and not the Information Technology Act, 2003 that pertains to obscene material. One can be charged under IPC sections 295A, 153, 153A and 505, and can be punished with imprisonment for up to five years,” said special public prosecutor and cyber expert Bivas Chatterjee. Unlike the IT Act, experts said IPC has a larger ambit, including people who merely forward such posts.Other senior officers, including joint CP (crime) Murlidhar Sharma, joint CP (organization) Neeloo Sherpa, DCP (traffic) Rupesh Kumar and DCP (south-east) Ajoy Prasad, also advised similar caution.In December, Kolkata Police had taken to Twitter to advise netizens to think twice before “hitting the forward button”.

KOLKATA: East-West Metro services are likely to be extended till Phoolbagan by May, said Metro Railway general manager Manoj Joshi after a two-hour visit to the underground station on Wednesday morning.Even though the 16.5km East-West Metro — that will link Salt Lake’s Sector V with Howrah Maidan — is being built by Kolkata Metro Rail Corporation (KMRC), it will be operated by Metro Railway, which runs the north-south line. Metro Railway’s general manager, thus, applies for CRS inspection. On February 13, when the 5km elevated stretch was unveiled, railway minister Piyush Goyal had said the Phoolbagan station would be added soon.Metro Railway has already written to the Commissioner of Railway Safety (CRS) to inspect the underground stretch till Phoolbagan so that services can be extended soon afterwards. Even though the Sector V-Stadium corridor has been welcomed by commuters, meaningful rider count is expected only after trains start plying between Salt Lake’s Sector V and Phoolbagan.Joshi said, “The CRS has raised some questions which we are trying to address. Hopefully, the CRS inspect-ion will happen by the end of March.”On Wednesday, Joshi, accompanied by senior Metro Railway officials, arrived at the station around 10.20am. KMRC’s managing director Manas Sarkar showed him around. Joshi inspected every inch of the facility, especially the hi-tech sections, like the automatic station control room, the platform screen doors (PSDs) and the ventilation system. Joshi’s interest in the ventilation system was understandable since this will ensure that cool air circulating through the platform doesn’t escape into the tunnel like it does in the north-south stations.“The tunnel has some unique characters too. Since it will be cut off from the station by screen doors, ducts have been built to maintain ventilation inside the tunnel. The ducts will suck out hot air blowing out of the moving trains and direct it through the ventilation shafts on either side of the platform,” said an engineer.When Phoolbagan is added, Metro trains will ply underground in the city after 25 years. The last time a Metro rake made its debut underground — for a trial run — it was at the north-south line’s MG Road station, which started operating in September 1995. All new stations added to the north-south line since then have been above the ground, connecting tracks laid on viaducts.",kolkata,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74333402,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-616254,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/e-ws-sec-v-phoolbagan-connection-likely-in-may/articleshow/74326541.cms

Drummer Dashrath Rathod

RAJKOT: A 25-year-old drummer got injured during marriage processon of folk artists Mayabhai Ahir’s daughter in Bhavnagar on Tuesday night. However, it is not clear if the injury was caused by celebratory gun firing or during fire cracker bursting.

Though no formal complaint has been registered, the police has received an application from the hospital and based on that investigation has begun.

According to the police, Dashrath Rathod, a resident of Juna Vadaj in Ahmedabad was hired as one of the drummers for the marriage procession that had come to Borda village of Talaja taluka from Amreli.

While people were dancing around the drummers some were bursting firecrackers nearby. After a loud sound Rathod fell on the ground. He had blood oozing out of his ears.

He was rushed to nearby hospital. R A Vadher, police sub-inspector of Datha police station said “We have received report that the drummer was injured due to firing from a gun between 9.30pm and 10.30pm on Tuesday night. We are investigating the matter.”

When contacted, Ahir told TOI, “I was busy in marriage arrangements. This incident took place when the marriage procession was 500 meters away from the venue. I did not hear any gunshot sound. I am told that our relatives did not fire any arms. The drummer might have got hit by a fire cracker.”

Ahir is a known folk artist in Saurashtra. He had also organised a ‘Lok Dayro’ on Monday night which was attended by many ministers of state government, including home minister Pradeepsinh Jadeja.

75,['27/02/2020'],Patna Airport News: Work on new Patna airport terminal gathers pace,"This story is from February 27, 2020

Construction of new domestic terminal building at Patna Airport on Wednesday

PATNA: The construction work for the new terminal building and other auxiliary units at the Jayaprakash Narayan International Airport is moving at a fast pace after being hit by delays in the take-off of the infrastructure projects.

Centre has allocated Rs 1,216 crore to the Airports Authority of India for the new terminal, which the Patna airport authorities hope to complete within two years. The two-storey structure is targeted to be ready by October 2022. The terminal will have the departure lounge on the first floor and arrival area on the ground floor.

“We need to keep the existing terminal building operational till the new one comes up,” said K S Vijayan, general manager (engineering), projects, AAI Patna . He added that relocating utility services and dismantling the existing structures to make way for the new terminal is a challenging task.

“To ensure that passengers don’t suffer, extension of the existing building is in progress which is spread over 1,850sqm on the eastern side of the terminal building, which is likely to be ready within one month,” Vijayan told this newspaper.

The extended area of the terminal will have security hold, check-in counters, X-ray baggage machines, male and female frisking booths, shopping outlets, retail segments and lounge facility.

Nearly 45% work on the cargo complex, technical block, fire station, air traffic control tower and multi-level car parking, has been completed. “These auxiliary buildings would be operational by March 2021. Two floor of G+5 multi-level car parking is complete, now the construction company is working on slab casting for the third floor,” Vijayan said.

Around 40% has been completed on the residential area of the airport, where six buildings are being constructed to accommodate 108 aviation employees.

Vijayan said, “One of the three hangars coming up on the land provided by the state government was nearing completion and it would be ready within a week. Total three hangars and offices of flying club and civil aviation, VIP room and guesthouse will also come up. For this we are demolishing the old structure.”

The construction work on IMD building would begin once the IMD headquarters in New Delhi finalises the layout of the new building.

76,['27/02/2020'],HC: Can Rs 12 cap for channels be put off?,"This story is from February 27, 2020

Swati Deshpande | TNN

Mumbai: The Bombay high court on Wednesday asked the counsels of the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India ( Trai ) to take instructions and get back to it on Thursday whether the new tariff cap of Rs 12 per pay channel in a bouquet can be deferred. The HC said it was necessary to ask this as it would take some time to hear the plea for an interim relief in the challenge to the validity of the new January 2020 tariff regime.

Television broadcasters, channels and producers have approached the HC to challenge the January 1 order by Trai that restricts the price of individual pay channels within a bouquet being offered to consumers. A bevy of senior counsels appeared on their behalf to seek interim relief. They suggested that at least till their plea is heard at length, the 2017 regime that allows for a price of Rs 19 per pay channel in the bouquet may be continued. Their argument was that this would protect the rights of broadcasters and even other stakeholders, including distributors.

In its order, the bench of Justices Amjad Sayed and Anuja Prabhudessai , said, “Considering the above and given the complex issues involved, it may not be easy task for us to hear all the counsels for the petitioners and the respondents and pass orders on the interim relief sought in the two days left with us before the impugned 2020 Regulations and 2020 Tariff Order is to come into force” from March 1.

Mukul Rohatgi, counsel for Star which is one of the petitioners, said, “Trai has no jurisdiction over content being provided by broadcasters.” Janak Dwarkadas, counsel for show producers, agreed with this and said that the regulator cannot act like it is “Alice in Wonderland” and must see that even the Kerala HC this month granted interim relief to several multi-system operators who challenged similar price restrictions imposed on them.

Dwarkadas said the Supreme Court in December 2018 had observed that there has to be a “balancing act” between rights of broadcasters as well as consumers. Other counsels Ravi Kadam, Navroz Seervai and Gopal Jain also submitted essentially that, till such time that the matter is heard for interim reliefs, no coercive action be taken. Jain is arguing for the broadcasters’ federation.

Trai counsels Venkatesh Dhond, Vineet Naik and Ashish Kamath said the broadcasters can publish a rate card within 15 days. But Kadam said, “This will be an offer by the broadcasters, which will lead to agreements. How do they go back (to recover money) if HC strikes down the new regulation eventually?” He and Dwarkadas said, “Challenge is admitted. The court had on January 30 already taken into consideration that the matter requires hearing.”

Rohatgi said it was a question of the rights of broadcasters too and that it is not the right of consumers to free entertainment. He said such price restriction will lead to “insignificant and minimal content” with cricket league coverage and shows of quality being hit. Dwarkadas gave an example of “Kyunki Saas...” but quickly added ‘Bigg Boss’ after peals of laughter at the mention of the old soap.

But Dhond said, “What is really pinching them is revenue.” He and Naik added that a plea being admitted doesn’t mean interim relief necessarily follows. Dhond said that the broadcasters were essentially trying to “ensure that the new regulation is still born”. He and Naik said that the new price was the result of an elaborate deliberation with all stakeholders and it was felt that broadcasters were abusing the freedom they had by making a la carte economically non-palatable to consumers so that they only choose bouquets.

For Trai, Dhond said, “Let me present our case. Detailed arguments are required for interim relief ... is what even the bench of Justices S C Dharmadhikari and Riyaz Chagla had said in an order earlier.” Dwarkadas said, “If the 2017 regulation, which caps pay channels at Rs 19, is kept on for a while, heavens are not going to fall. What is the great undue haste to bring in the new regime?”

Jain said, “Propriety demands that Trai holds Its hand for a while.” He added, “It is a balance of inconvenience. All stakeholders are dissatisfied. All challenged it.”

Chennai: India’s truck industry, which is reeling under an unprecedented slowdown due to slowing economic activity and proposed migration to BS6 powered vehicles from April 1, will contract by 10% to 25% in the current calendar year, a senior industry official said.

“Our forecast for the industry is that sales will fall to 2 lakh vehicles from 2.45 lakh in 2019. The best case scenario is 10% drop and worst could be 25%,” said Satyakam Arya, MD& CEO of Daimler India Commercial Vehicles (DICV).

The year 2019 was the worst year for the truck makers in nearly two decades. Sales of trucks dropped to 2,49,000 units from 3,78,000 units in 2018. “We saw the worst year for the industry from the best year,” he said.

In domestic sales, DICV’s sales dropped by 36% to 14,474 units YoY, in line with a 35% drop in industry volume. “The good news is that we remained profitable in a challenging year,” he added. Export volume rose to 8,000 units from 7,100 a year ago.

“We also sourced parts worth $125 million for the year from our Indian suppliers to our global operations,” Arya said.

On the bus side, Daimler Buses saw a 11% sales growth and 56% exports growth. “We expect the same levels of growth for this year also,” saod Daimler Buses India MD Thomas Fricke.

DICV has initiated work to get into freight aggregation space either picking up stakes in existing players or starting one on its own. The German company’s Indian arm will also explore foray into off highways engines and defence as part of de risking in a cyclical industry. “We are expecting some changes in the defence suppliers policy which today forbids a foreign company to participate and supply trucks to Indian arm forces,” Arya said.

Accused in the custody of Rajkot police

Rajkot: Three persons were arrested on Wednesday for allegedly kidnapping the owner of a jewellery showroom in Bhavnagar on January 29.

Police said the accused, identified as Rohit Kotar (30), Yashpalsinh Chudasma (28), his brother Shaktisinh Chudasma (27) and Kalpesh Kotar, had allegedly kidnapped Mukesh Jodhvani (43) from his residence in Prarabhda Residency at Bhangli Gate in Hill Drive locality of Bhavnagar. While police had arrested Rohit, Yashpalsinh and Saktisinh, Kalpesh is still at large.

“The accused had demanded ransom of Rs 50 lakh cash and jewellery worth Rs 50 lakh and only after receiving the ransom they released Jodhvani on January 31. The accused had kidnapped Jodhvani using a car after stopping his two-wheeler near his residence. The accused had threatened Jodhvani with firearms and knives while kidnapping him,” said N G Chaudhary, inspector with Neelambaug police station.

After paying the ransom and ensuring his release, Jodhvani was reluctant to lodge a formal police complaint out of fear. However later, when Vibhavari Dave, minister of state for women and child welfare, came to know about the crime, she convinced Jodhvani to lodge the complaint.

After the complaint was lodged, Bhavnagar deputy superintendent of police Manish Thakar formed four members team. “We initiated the investigation on the basis of CCTV footages of the crime spot, mobile network and using our informers. We traced the accused and nabbed them on Wednesday,” said Thakar.

The police recovered Rs 12.10 lakh cash, two cars and two cellphones from the accused. During the probe, the police found the involvement of one Kalpesh in the crime and launched a manhunt for him.

JODHVANI WAS BRUTALLY TORTURED

During his captivity, Jodhvani was brutally tortured allegedly by the accused. “The accused beat him up with bats and fractured his right hand. Then they laid him on a funeral pyre and threatened to set him ablaze, if he did not pay the ransom,” said Chaudhary.

The driver was riding the truck at high speed as the road was empty

Surat: A major accident was averted when a sand carting truck ploughed into a closed shop after jumping the road divider at Navjivan circle on the Udhana-Madgalla road during early hours of Wednesday. The driver, who was stuck inside the truck , was rescued by the fire fighters. He suffered serious body injuries.

Ram Gopal Pal (40), a driver of the carting truck was going towards Magdalla when he lost control of the vehicle and rammed into a automobile spare parts shop located on the main thoroughfare after jumping the road divider.

By: Sandeep ThomasTHRISSUR: Among hundreds of captive elephants in Kerala , there are no dearth of stars. So was the case with Gajaratnam Guruvayur Padmanabhan that died on Wednesday.Though not one of the tallest tuskers in the state, Padmanabhan stood above all of them, its status of being Guruvayurappan's favourite son making him the ‘tallest’.As the tusker that had been carrying the golden thidambu (replica of the presiding deity) of Guruvayurappan for years, devotees considered Padmanabhan as Lord Guruvayurappan himself. Wherever it went, people welcomed with garlands and even spread floral carpets for it.Padmanabhan reached Guruvayur temple at the age of 14 as an offering made by a devotee. After the legendary Guruvayur Kesavan’s death in 1976, Padmanabhan succeeded as the tusker to carry the ‘pon thidambu’ of Lord Krishna. In no time the elephant rose to fame and emerged as the most sought-after tusker in the festival circuit.Padmanabhan could also easily win over the crowds with its friendly demeanour. There has been no single occasion of Padmanabhan turning violent and harming any devotee: its mahouts, however, were often at the receiving end whenever it lost its temper.Writer and elephant enthusiast Madambu Kunjukkuttan said: “People regarded Padmanabhan as Lord Guruvayurappan himself. His Godly status earned him respect from all corners. After Guruvayur Kesavan, Padmanabhan emerged as the undisputed star.”Thiruvambady devaswom president Prof M Madhavankutty said Padmanabhan had graced Thrissur pooram for almost 40 years.“If Padmanabhan attended a festival, it was the unwritten rule or custom that he should carry the thidambu. No temple committees or elephant owners objected to this ‘rule’,” he said.Paramekkavu Devaswom president Satheesh Menon recalled Padmanabhan carrying the thidambu of Paramekkavu Devi in two Thrissur poorams. “His death is a big loss.”The elephant, captured from the Nilambur forests by an Alathur-based group, was offered to the temple by the owners of Ottappalam-based E P Brothers Group’s late EP Achuthan Nair and late E P Madhavan Nair on November 18, 1954.“There was a vazhipadu (vow to offer) to donate an elephant when my grandmother Lakshmikutty Amma fell sick, and the promise was fulfilled after her death,’’ recalled Rajkumar Nair, son of Madhavan Nair.“We used to visit him at the elephant yard of the temple and feed him. We could go close to it and hold its tusk. The mahouts used to bring it to our house at Ottappalam whenever it was passing through the area,’’ said Chithresh Nair, younger son of Madhavan Nair.R Narayanan and K P Karunakaran, retired deputy administrators of the Guruvayur Devaswom recalled Padmanabhan as docile. Devaswom chairman K B Mohandas and the Guruvayur MLA K V Abdul Khader have requested for a state funeral to the elephant.According to legends, Brahminy kites used to hover in the sky when it is paraded in the festival.In Video: Devotees pay tribute to Kerala's most loved tusker Gajaratnam Guruvayur Padmanabhan",kochi,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74327065,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-192359,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/lord-krishnas-tallest-son-and-kesavans-successor/articleshow/74325787.cms

Supreme Court

NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court bench, which was hearing the plea for removal of the Shaheen Bagh protesters, refused to take cognisance of the violence in north-east Delhi, as pleaded by some petitioners, including former chief information commissioner Wajahat Habibullah and Bhim Army chief Chandrashekhar Azad . The bench said it would confine itself to the Shaheen Bagh protest and asked them to file a separate petition and approach the Delhi high court, which is hearing a plea on the issue.

Talking about the violence that had wracked northeast Delhi, the court said lives could have been saved and the situation controlled if police had taken timely action. It said the government should learn from how police in the UK and the US function without seeking a nod from other authorities.

Solicitor general Tushar Mehta, appearing for Delhi Police, however, said it was not right to blame police as they worked under very tough conditions. He said even when police take coercive action, they are still questioned in court. He said the ground reality was very different and a head constable was killed and a DCP lynched by a mob when they were discharging their duty.

The court, however, asked why the situation worsened to such an extent. “Why does it happen? If you start taking action against them then you will see the difference. It is very serious that 13 (the known toll then) people died,” the bench said.

84,['27/02/2020'],Imports from Africa might hit cashew prices,"This story is from February 27, 2020

Visakhapatnam: Farmers stand to lose in a big way with cashew procurement rates likely to plummet as low as Rs 6,000 per a bag of 88-kg this season.

Procurers said cashew imported from Africa are already in the market and would decrease demand for local cashew.

Traders and cashew processing unit owners have made it clear that the orchard growers in north coastal AP would suffer the most as cashew is chiefly grown in Srikakulam, Visakhapatnam and Vizianagaram districts.

Ch Raju, a farmer from Narsipatnam division, said: “Two years ago, cashew dominated Mango as the prime income provider in mixed orchards, the 88-kilo bag price (procurement rate from farmers) touched an all-time high of Rs 12,000, taking base procurement price of cashew with kernel to Rs 140.”

Sources in Palasa cashew market said there could be a major depression in local procurement prices, forcing the farmers to make desperate sales. Unfortunately, for most farmers, cashew has become the mainstay along with mango in mixed orchards and for them to make the switch to another crop could take at least five years.

The traders suggested that the government must impose heavy import duties on cashew from Africa, if the local farmers were to be protected.

Malla Sinivas, President of the Cashew Manufacturers Association, said: ”This is a death trap for local farmers. All these years, they have been used to very high procurement prices, making cashew one of the most viable orchard-cash crops for farmers. There was a time when agents would go from farm to farm procuring cashew (with kernel) during the season, while the farmers spent nothing on transportation costs, this scenario is going to change soon.”

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: As 75-year-old Sarvari raised her hand to shout ‘inquilab ayega’, the crowd assembled for the ‘occupy Raj Bhavan’ protest in the state capital responded in solidarity with Shaheen Bagh protesters.

Sarvari and 82-year-old Bilkis, popularly know as ‘Shaheen Bagh dadis’ (grandmothers) after they led the protest against CAA and NRC in Delhi, were in Thiruvananthapuram to participate in ‘occupy Raj Bhavan’ protest organised by Welfare Party on Wednesday.

Sarvari condemned the Modi government for unleashing attack on innocent people to suppress their protests and said these atrocities will only strengthen their voice. “We have a Constitution which speaks about equal rights. The country does not belong to him (Modi). How can a Prime Minister do this to his country. We the people elected him (Modi) as our PM. Claiming to bring peace, Modi, Amit Shah and their police are attacking innocent people,” said Sarvari.

“Modi speaks about ‘beti bachao, beti padhao’. When the girls are being assaulted in the country, how will they study and lead a life. We have completed 75 days of protest on road and will continue doing it. If we die, we will die in this land,” Sarvari added.Speaking about her Thiruvananthapuram visit from New Delhito participate in the protest here, Bilkis said the whole country was coming to Shaheen Bagh to support their protest and it is their responsibility to attend similar protests across the country.

“If we can travel at this age for the cause, youngsters can do more to save the Constitution and the country. The government and police are trying to sabotage our peaceful protests and promote the black law through riots. We do not want this kind of Prime Minister. Many people were killed in past few days, still nothing has been done by the government. We will continue the protest till the government decides to revoke their decision. We have faith in court’s decision regarding NRC and if we do not get a favourable verdict, the protest will continue,” said Bilkis.

They also criticised the central government for spending so much on US president Donald Trump’s visit while people are struggling to find a living. Sarvari will be returning to Shaheen Bagh to join the protest, while Bilkis will be travelling to Kolkata to participate in another CAA protest.

On the second day of the protest, Congress leader K Muraleedharan MP and CMP leader C P John also spoke. The Welfare Party protest in which hundreds of people lay siege to Raj Bhavan for 30 hours concluded on Wednesday evening.

Amaravati: With the works going on at full pace, Polavaram project site has got a new life with nearly 5,000 labourers working day and night.

Top officials from the irrigation department camped at the site and are monitoring the progress of the project as chief minister Y S Jaganmohan Reddy is expected to inspect the works on Friday.

Megha Engineering and Infrastructure Limited (MEIL), the new contractor for the project, has deputed experts and senior engineers as the government is keen to complete the project ahead of the August, 2021 deadline.

The company is using advanced technology to complete 3.07 lakh cubic meters of concrete work in eight months.

The Polavaram project was launched in 2004 but then then chief minister Y S Rajasekhara Reddy’s death in 2009 slowed down the work.

Continuous movement of vehicles has set the apprehensions about the completion of the project aside. “We intended to complete the work related to the main reservoir including the spillway, earth-cum-rockfill dam by 2021 kharif season. If all goes well, we would be able to complete the works by June 2021,” said A Satish Babu, general manager, MEIL.

He said the work related to 51 blocks of spillway are critical and the company has placed sophisticated technology to overcome the hurdles. He said they have deployed enough engineers to complete the task.

Though works were re-initiated in November last year, they could not gain momentum with floods in the Godavari, resulting in the accumulation of nearly 4 tmc water at the construction site.

“Roads on the project site were damaged as the whole was submerged. It took three months for MEIL to de-water the area and rebuild the roads. Works had taken a new pace since February,” said Satish Babu.

KOLKATA: Mayor Firhad Hakim on Wednesday pleaded with hawkers not to encroach on the pavements and urged them to discontinue using plastic sheets so as to prevent fire hazards. He also requested them to keep their stalls and the vicinity clean and not throw the waste in the open.Addressing close to 2,500 hawkers at Raja Subodh Mullick Square on the golden jubilee of the National Hawker Federation on Wednesday, Hakim assured them that he will not remove a single hawker, but make them “state-of-the-art”.“You do your business, but please do not encroach. Stay hawkers but do not become encroachers. Please do not use plastic, which not only looks ugly but is a huge fire hazard. There are so many safe options available. Use them,” Hakim said.A blaze in Bagree Market in September 2018, which had raged for over 82 hours, had started in a hawker’s stall on the pavement along Canning Street. In January last year, a fire in a stall in Gariahat had spread rapidly to a nearby building due to the plastic sheets used by the hawkers. The KMC had made a few model stalls for the hawkers after that, but they did not find many takers.“If you do not like the make and colour of the stalls we have made, give us your inputs. We will work on them. But follow the safety norms. Also, keep the area clean because we get our livelihood from there,” the mayor added.Citizens have often complained about the lack of space on the pavements which forces them to walk on the carriageway. But Hakim assured the crowd on Wednesday that nobody would remove hawkers from the streets of the city. “You have the right to do your business there. We will bring people from abroad to showcase our street food vendors,” he said.Hakim also hailed the green e-commerce platform Hawker Bazar, which was launched on Wednesday evening. It will enable consumers to order food from their favourite vendor in the vicinity through an app available on Google Play Store. The green e-commerce platform using Borlaug blockchain will also enable the hawkers to source provisions directly from the producers. Speaking of the app, Hakim said it will also aid in freeing up pavements since many of the regulars will be able to just order the food online instead of taking up space to eat at the specific stalls.“This will create a level playing field for our street food vendors who suffer due to lack of resources and knowhow. It will also benefit lakhs of office goers who can have fresh and economically priced food in their offices,” said Hakim.",kolkata,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74333466,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-678790,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/conduct-business-but-do-not-encroach-firhad-urges-hawkers/articleshow/74326540.cms

AHMEDABAD: A She team of Naorda police station patrolling at night in plain clothes were in for a shock as they were assaulted and pelted with stones by a mob near Chiloda Ring Road on Tuesday, according to the FIR filed by them.

The trouble started when the She team, comprisingly mainly of women cops, quizzed a man, Nishant Barot, of Bapunagar, who was standing under suspected circumstances near a car. Barot, according to the FIR, was defiant and asked in turn pointing at his purse, “I have money. Wll you come with me to Pritam Hotel?” Taken aback with the obscene behaviour, the members of the She team flashed their identity cards at him. When Barot realized he had invited trouble, he attempted to turn the tables on the cops yelling ‘fake police’. This attracted locals who rushed to his rescue.

The FIR named one Ashok Patel, his wife Shweta Patel, Jhanvi Patel and about 100-150 people who gheraoed the cops. All persons mentioned have been booked for assault. The She team claims they were shoved and jostled by the crowd and assaulted. Head constable of the team, Harita Rajeshbhai, called up the police station and asked for help. “Other teams arrived and dispersed the crowd by use of force,” the FIR stated. ACP G division, A M Desai said, “We have arrested Nishant Barot and are searching for the rest.” In the FIR, complainant Harita Rajeshbhai has claimed that in front of the She team members the five accused tore her dress. They also manhandled with her and her colleagues.

AMARAVATI: The locals’ bond with capital city Amaravati is such that they are not hesitating to raise their voice for one capital city even during weddings.

The people of the capital city area, who have been relentlessly participating in agitations for Amaravati, took protests to the next level on Wednesday when a newly-wed couple and their family members sported placards in favour of Amaravati. The bridegroom Jammula Sudheer, native of Guntur, is working as an accounts executive at a private firm. He tied knot with girl from Thullur village on Wednesday. An activist of Telugu Desam Party (TDP), Sudheer decided to make his wedding a memorable by making family members and friends raise their voice for Amaravati.

J Malleswara Rao, Sudheer’s father, said that it was not proper for the state government to undermine the sacrifice of the capital city farmers. He said that people from all districts were extending support to the cause of Amaravati as it was the peoples’ capital city. The friends and family members of the wedding couple have also shouted slogans demanding that the state government retain Amaravati as single capital city of the state.

Meanwhile, former minister Somireddy Chandramohan Reddy, who participated in the farmers dharna in Mandadam village, said that Amaravati would surely tighten the noose around the YSRC government. He said that BJP leaders were insulting the Prime Minister Narendra Modi by backing Jagan on the issue of three capital cities as Modi had laid the foundation stone for Amaravati. He said that they would bring the capital city back to Amaravati even if Jagan shifted it. He said that the firms which entered into agreements with CRDA, state government and Centre would drag the present government to court and retain the capital city in Amaravati. “YSRC leaders compared Amaravati with burial ground. How could they distribute house sites to the poor in Amaravati? Do they want the poor to live in the burial ground?” Somireddy asked.

Former minister Nakka Anand Babu warned the police not to take the law into their hands as they would surely land in trouble in future. He said that police were deliberately implicating the commoners in the false cases just for opposing the government’s decisions.

Seeing their son Himal paint, at a time when even holding a fork seemed like an impossible task, Harish Bikmal and his wife realised their son was on a path of inspiration. Himal was diagnosed with severe non-verbal autism at the age of two but his art has inspired his father Harish, a native of Hyderabad now settled in Virginia to co-found Zenaviv. The initiative provides a platform that promotes and empowers people with autism to showcase their artistic talents.

As parents of a child diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), Harish and his wife Sandhya had to face a lot of difficulties with Himal constantly falling sick due to a compromised immune system. With the recurring health problems, the couple was worried about their son’s future. On two instances, Himal had run away from home. He was unable to communicate, resorting to crying and shouting to express his discomfort. These incidents only made the distress of his parents mount further. They were running out of hope.

However one fine day, while Himal’s mother was painting, he snatched her paintbrush away. But what he did next surprised his parents. He started painting. At this time, Himal was around ten-years-old and even holding cutlery was a challenge for him. While he went to work on the canvas, his parents realised that this expression of his was their ray of hope. Since that day, they decided to nurture their son’s talent and even found an art teacher to help him pursue his passion.

“A few years back, there was no insurance to cover children with autism. With medical bills mounting, we decided to organise a fundraiser showcasing Himal’s artwork. His paintings were converted into around 1,500 postcards and within two hours, they were all sold out. As many as 130 of his paintings were sold in a span of six hours,” Harish Bikmal told TOI. “Himal could not understand what was going on but his face would light up every time someone came up and paid him a compliment. This is what inspired me to establish Zenaviv,” Himal’s father added.

“The love for painting empowered Himal. He would smile when he would paint and would even insist we clicked a picture of him with his painting. We thought that if painting can transform the life of our child, we can help parents of other children with a similar condition to find their passion and purpose. Our goal is to improve the self-esteem of children with special needs by helping them showcase their talents to the world and change the perception of parents,” Harish said.

Now all of 18 years, Himal is undergoing training for table tennis, taekwondo and fitness. It requires patience to try out different things and recognise the potential of a child with special needs and Harish asserts that there is always a possibility for things to get better. “Not every child will have an interest in painting. Some may be talented in playing instruments and some could be good at swimming,” Harish says adding that the visual memory in children is very strong and it is essential to focus on the strengths of one’s child.

Jaipur: “My mother’s family has been completely wiped out,” said a tearful Ramdev Dhobi, whose elder brother too died in the tragic accident in Bundi on Wednesday morning. Ramdev’s maternal family was going to attend a wedding and he himself was supposed to join them in Sawai Madhopur.

Ramdev’s brother Ramesh was one of the passengers killed in the mishap and talking to TOI, the bereaved said, “My uncles, aunts, cousins, real brother and other relatives were going to Sawai Madhopur to attend a wedding function but this tragedy occurred. I was supposed to join them at the wedding. My brother had gone earlier to travel with the relatives.”

Ramdev further claimed that 27 of his family members died in the accident, though officials have said that 24 persons, including the driver, were killed. “There were 34 of my relatives in the bus out of which 27 have died,” said Ramdev while choking on his tears.

Ramdev further added that the shock is unbearable for the rest of the family, who are unable to believe that what was supposed to be a happy occasion has turned into such a tragedy. “I really don’t know what to say anymore. My ‘nanihal’ (relatives from maternal family) is completely gone just like that and it is the most difficult time for us,” he added.

DG Vanzara

AHMEDABAD: After he got a clean chit in both Sohrabuddin Shaikh-Tulsiram Prajapati and Ishrat encounter cases , former IPS officer DG Vanzara was given the long awaited promotion of Inspector General of Police ( IGP) with effect from September 29, 2007. He will get arrears from the deemed date of promotion.

Vanzara tweeted about his post retirement promotion also tagging the order from the government on Tuesday. “God is great. I had done nothing wrong but only protected Gujarat from terrorism,” Vanzara told TOI on Wednesday.

Vanzara, 66, who retired in May 2014 while he was in Sabarmati Central jail in connection with the Ishrat encounter case, said he is hopeful that he will soon get his ‘due’ promotion for the rank of ADGP. Vanzara, in his tweet, thanked both central and state government for the promotion.

Vanzara’s son Prithviraj Vanzara also tweeted and expressed his pleasure that his father got what he deserved. He also expressed immense pleasure and gratitude towards the governments.

Vanzara, who had joined the police service as a deputy superintendent of police (DySP) in 1980, was promoted as an IPS officer in 1987. He served as deputy commissioner of police of Ahmedabad crime branch and was later promoted as DIG of anti terrorism squad (ATS) in Ahmedabad. At the time of his arrest on April 24, 2007, he was posted as the Border Range of Kutch and Banaskantha.

Sohrabuddin Sheikh was killed in November 2005 and Tulsiram Prajapati was shot dead in December 2006. Vanzara was arrested in both these cases by the state CID (crime). Later, these cases were handed over to CBI for further probe and merged together. While in prison, Vanzara was arrested again by CBI in another encounter case in which Mumbai-based 19-year-old girl Ishrat Jahan, Javed Shaikh alias Pranesh Pillai, Amjad Ali Rana and Zishan Johar were killed in June 2004.

Chennai: It’s no longer just word of mouth that will endorse the work of 40-year-old S Devaraji, a construction labourer for a little more than two decades, he now has a certificate to validate his skills as a mason.

Under the programme by the Tamil Nadu Skill Development Corporation ( TNSDC ) of the labour ministry, unorganised sector workers like Devaraji can now receive national and international validated certificates. The government’s grassroots initiative ensures better employability of youth in the country and abroad and keeps a ready trained resource pool that it can select from when projects come up. For the workers it means being trained for free in workshops that help them pick up tips, gives them recognition and an avenue to ask for better pay depending on their expertise.

""I have been working for more than 20 years and learned the nuances of the vocation, but no document to prove my expertise. Now, I am happy I have a certificate, and that too from the government,"" said Devaraj from Kalandra village in Tirupattur district.

Devaraji, along with 20 others, underwent a three-day training programme organised by TNSDC. ""We learned to measure the exact ratio of preparing the concrete mixture and the amount of moisture that should be used to ensure crack free walls and what should be done before erecting wooden frames to keep away termites,"" said Devaraji.

A few hundred miles away, G Babu of Colachel in Kanyakumari district is a proud owner of a certificate that describes him as a decorative painter. ""This document will allow small-time workers like me to avail loans and take up contract work,"" he said.

The programme is aimed at creating a registry of skilled workforce in the unorganised sector, enhance their skills and improve their earning capacity. So far, 58,776 people have received such certificates, majority of them construction labourers, painters and fishermen. ""The Union government had signed several memorandums of understanding with various foreign countries to consider the validation certificates of the workforce from India. Hence, it will be an advantage for the workers who aspire to go abroad,"" said V Vishnu, managing director of TNSDC.

Nearly 2,000 fishermen from Chennai and neighbouring coastal districts have enrolled in the programme and trained in marine aquaculture. They were trained in repairing boats, deep sea fishing and other nuances of fishing to improve their inherent skills. ""Experts have sailed with the fishermen to assess their skills. Similarly, experts of each trade visit the worksite of the workers and assess their knowledge before certifying them. The certification will add value to avail government welfare schemes and subsidies under various schemes,"" said Vishnu.

Apart from the traditional sectors, the Ramnad district administration has been training youngsters to be guides under the programme. ""Tourism is a thriving industry in the district as it receives 1 crore pilgrims and tourists every year,"" said collector K Veera Raghava Rao.

The TNSDC has also envisaged sharing the registry with the Overseas Manpower Corporation (OMC), a government agency, to help certified workers find jobs abroad. The agency has inked a pact with the Indian Trade and Exhibition Centre at Sharjah, Health Education England and a few other industries in foreign countries to generate employment for the youth of TN. Authorities in OMC have stated a minimum of 500 nurses would be placed in health sector in the UK for the next three years. Apart from this, they would also employ a minimum of 1,000 people every year in different trades and industries in the UAE and its neighbouring countries.

98,['27/02/2020'],City sweet makers to meet FSSAI over ‘best-before’ rule,"This story is from February 27, 2020

Kolkata: The recent order from the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI), asking all sweet manufacturers to print the manufacturing date of their sweets and “best before” declarations, has put city sweet manufacturers in a fix. They will now be going to meet the FSSAI bosses in Delhi on March 4 and 5 to look for a solution to the problem. It is likely that the state will support the Paschim Banga Mistanna Byabasayee Samiti in this and send a representative to attend the meeting.

Most of the big sweet makers in Kolkata, however, said they understand the intent of the FSSAI and support the move because this will stop “smaller” manufacturers from trying to sell stale sweets, which are often “covered in thick sugar syrup to hide their staleness”. The declaration of manufacturing and best-before dates will definitely put a stop to this, they felt. However, they agreed there were some logistical issues that need to be sorted out as well.

The meeting will be part of Ahara, a national food festival, to which city sweet manufacturers have been invited. “It is known that Bengal sweets are made of chhana, unlike mawa that is used by sweet makers of other provinces. Chhana as a raw material is extremely fragile and decays after 24 hours so we do not sell sweets that are beyond a day old. We are already writing “to be consumed within 24 hours” on our products,” said Dhiman Das, spokesperson for K C Das.

Most bigger brands said some sweets and their manufacturing processes are so delicate that they spoil within hours. In peak summer, rosomalai and rosogolla, if left unrefrigerated, can spoil in eight hours. “We mentally keep tabs on this. Now we will have to declare it. However, writing them on shelves and on boxes are two different ball games and involve additional hassles,” said Subhojit Ghosh of Banchharam. He insisted that because of the short shelf life of Bengal sweets, it is still considered a cottage industry that needs all the support it can get to survive.

Most sweet manufacturers said the inclusion of Bengal sweets within the GST net has already affected the industry because of the huge cost involved in upgrading accounts. But if the FSSAI declaration involves a complicated process, it will further affect business.

“We want the process to be uncomplicated. At the time of manufacture, we keep back-end records of each batch and we know when to stop selling which tray. We don’t mind declaring it, but we are a bit confused about the process,” Ghosh added.

A spokesperson for the 200-year-old brand Nalin Chandra Das echoed the thought. “We have received the circular to give these declarations by June 1. We don’t mind and we agree that customers have a right to know how healthy the sweet is. However, if we are once again channelled into complications, we will suffer,” said proprietor Tapan Kumar Das.

File photo of BJP president JP Nadda

NEW DELHI: BJP president JP Nadda on Wednesday hailed Veer Damodar Savarkar as one of the greatest freedom fighters, saying he fought bravely against the British regime all his life and sacrificed each moment in service of the motherland.

“Savarkar was a visionary, a great hero of the freedom movement and I feel blessed to take part in an event in his memory,” Nadda said addressing a gathering through video-conferencing on the 54th death anniversary of the saffron ideologue at Ambedker Research Centre. Nadda was the chief guest for the event but could not come due to family engagements.

The NJP chief said Savarkar was a role model, a revolutionary and an ideology in himself and his dedication for the motherland was inspirational. “He (Savarkar) was one of the pioneers of a meaningful thinking. He shook the British by his flawless review of history. He was unique among revolutionaries,” he said.

Speaking on the occasion, actor-director Srirang Godbole said the government must name a nuclear submarine after Savarkar. “Why not INS Savarkar, INS Munje and INS Subhash?” he said.

The two-day conference commemorated Savarkar’s social, political, religious and ideological works with speakers being unanimously saying that he was castigated despite his contribution to the country.

Union culture and tourism minister Prahlad Singh Patel said, “If evaluation of work and role has to be done, it should be done for all. Savarkar did not get his due but it is our duty that we must strive to get him his due.”

Former Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh governor O P Kohli said Savarkar was the person who had first recognised 1857 movement as the “First War of Independence” and made Hinduism synonymous with nationalism.

Rajya Sabha MP Swapan Dasgupta said besides many other qualities of Savarkar, his being a political Hindu caused annoyance among many, especially Congress and other political outfits.

Talking to reporters, they said Naidu, who is now crying foul over assigned lands, himself had issued a GO mandating that such lands can be sold, while former chief minister YS Rajasekhara Reddy had brought in a legislation that lands given to weaker sections can neither be purchased nor sold.

“Chief minister YS Jaganmohan Reddy has declared Amaravati capital region as ‘people’s capital’ and ‘bahujana capital’ to bring in the concept of inclusiveness and give a sense of pride to those living in the area cutting across caste, creed, and religion. While the government is going ahead with the unique exercise of distributing house site pattas to the poor, Naidu has turned green with jealously and is instigating people to file a 1,500-page PIL, which shows his character and intent,” they alleged.

Private city bus operators stage a flash protest over installation of dividers at Talapady toll gate on Wednes... Read More

Mangaluru: Chaos prevailed at Talapady tollgate on Wednesday after private city bus operators staged a flash protest over installation of dividers at the tollgate.

The dividers hindered the movement of city buses, which take a U-turn before the Talapady tollgate, to avoid toll. However, the dividers were removed after the police intervened. The tussle between toll booth operators and city private bus owners has been going on from sometime now, ever since implementation of FASTag .

Due to the fee issue, city buses on the Mangaluru-Talapady route have been cutting short their trips, the last 100 metres, to avoid the tollgate at Talapady, after implementation of FASTag.

Dilraj Alva, president of the Dakshina Kannada Bus Operators’ Association said on Wednesday that all of a sudden toll booth operators have installed dividers across toll booths, making it difficult to take a turn from the Talapady tollgate. “Irked with this sudden development, which was done to harass city buses, we staged a protest, and after the police interveded, the same was removed,” he said, adding that the MP and DC asked toll operators to maintain the status quo, till a final decision is taken on the toll fee.

Dilraj explained that about 28 city buses ply to Talapady every day. Before the implementation of FASTag, all the vehicles were passing by the toll gate for free. The distance between Talapady toll gate to the last stop is about a km. “Now tollbooth operators are demanding a fee of Rs 30,000 per month for each bus but we are negotiating to pay Rs 4,500. A bus operator cannot pay such a huge amount as toll fee each month and sustain business,” he said.

Jurisdictional police said that a meeting between bus operators and toll booth contractors is scheduled on Saturday to decide about the toll fee.

‘Shift Surathkal tollgate’

Karanam Uma Maheshwar Rao, director, National Institute of Technology Karnataka Surathkal on Tuesday requested Union minister of human resources development (HRD) Ramesh Pokhriyal to shift the toll gate in front of the 60-year-old technical institution.

He said that the toll gate is causing inconvenience to NITK Surathkal staff and students. It is important to shift the Surathkal toll gate due to safety concerns, especially for girl students. NITK Surathkal was the first institution to protest against the toll booth, citing security and safety of the students as well as children, who study at the school on campus. However, the authorities never gave paid heed to their plea. The tollgate is 12m away from the technical institution, which has around 5,500 students. Also, nearly 1,200 children from LKG to high school study in Kannada and English medium schools situated in the same campus.

The campus is spread on both sides of the road. Since 2011, NITK authorities have written more than six letters to the district administration and chief secretary of the state government.

Dehradun: The Uttarakhand cabinet , chaired by chief minister Trivendra Singh Rawat, approved a separate eco-sensitive zone (ESZ) inside the Rajaji National Park on Wednesday.

According to government sources, around 296 of 819 square kilometres of Rajaji National Park would come under the eco-sensitive zone. Also, 22 out of a total of 825 villages situated in the national park area would be part of the eco-sensitive zone.

The cabinet also gave its nod to the introduction of self-assessment tax system for house tax in municipalities and nagar panchayats in the state. The amended Act for change in self-assessment tax system would be introduced in the assembly during the upcoming budget session. The new system would be applicable in 41 municipalities and nagar panchayats in the state. Till now, the self-assessment tax in property or house tax was only enforced in municipal corporations in the state.

The decision to introduce the system was brought with an aim to improve the financial conditions of municipalities and nagar panchayats.

The cabinet also decided to provide incentives to private insemination centres for artificial insemination of animals in all 13 districts of the state. According to government sources, an incentive of Rs 50 would be provided in the hills and Rs 40 in plains.

The cabinet also approved the bill that gives power to the state government to close down slaughter houses in the districts.

Meanwhile, the Van Gujjar community in Haridwar, which lives near Rajaji, welcomed the cabinet’s decision on the eco-sensitive zone and said that it would help the community to sort out their long-pending rehabilitation problem.

The state cabinet had around two weeks back, approved a 377 sqkm area for the proposed eco-sensitive zone for the Corbett Tiger Reserve (CTR) as well. No village was included in the ESZ, for which the maximum area was defined as 7.96 km. The creation of ESZ in Corbett has been a prickly issue, with villagers living near the reserve often protesting against the inclusion of their respective villages in the ESZ fearing loss of livelihood due to the restrictions imposed by the creation of such a zone. To recall, the Uttarakhand high court had earlier directed that a 10km-area around CTR as well as other sanctuaries in Uttarakhand be declared as ESZ.

He said that since Canada has approximately one quarter of the arctic territory of the world, they’re looking forward to collaborate with NCPOR to undertake research in the Canadian Arctic wherein the scientists will work in and around the community of Cambridge bay where POLAR’s research facility is based.“We can have small day trips that will take us 10-15 km away from the station and in future we anticipate going even further away into more remote locations and set up a temporary camp and do various investigations, particularly in places which have the right characteristics for scientists to make observations,” he said.“Canada is very happy to be working in collaboration with India. Our countries worked together on several levels but as we get more detailed for Polar Knowledge Canada, it’s a real privilege to be creating a partnership with the NCPOR. The high-quality scientists on this research campus are well-equipped with the latest analytical machinery and experts,” he said.“India really is a polar nation that has been studying the Antarctic for years and is becoming increasingly active in the Arctic ,” he added.",goa,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74331040,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-307262,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/vascos-polar-research-centre-inks-mou-with-canadian-facility-for-summer-collaboration/articleshow/74325837.cms

Sambit Patra

PANAJI: Condemning the “atmosphere created by CAA protesters during US President Donald Trump’s visit”, BJP’s national spokesperson Sambit Patra said that the protesters, who were until now conspiring against Prime Minister Narendra Modi, may start conspiring against the country.

“The BJP wants peace,” said Patra, who was in the state capital for an interaction with Goa’s legislators, businessmen and other prominent citizens on Wednesday.

He said that the protesters were trying to blackmail the government to backtrack on CAA, just as Rajiv Gandhi’s government was blackmailed during the Shah Bano case.

“No one wanted to touch the CAA issue or the abrogation of article 370, with a barge-pole. When a government finally takes decisions on such big issues, some are bound to find it difficult to digest it. They will try to bring instability, not just in the government, but in the country. You have to stand like a rock behind the government,” said Patra.

He said that between 1989 and 2019, 48,000 people had died due to terrorism sponsored by Pakistan.

He said since Pakistan’s creation, the number of its minorities had dropped from 23% to just 1.5% today, while the minority population in India has risen from 9% to 16% since its independence.

“This is an indication of how well India has treated its minorities,” Patra said.

In the case of Goa, infrastructure gets a huge boost only when the BJP is in power in the state, he said.

AHMEDABAD: A 32-year-old man and his elder brother were booked for “hurting cops” when they allegedly got into a scuffle in which two buttons of a traffic cop’s uniform were torn. Ironically, they were booked for ‘causing hurt’ at the traffic police station where the cops are deployed, even though traffic police are not supposed to register such case but send them to local police station.

Late on Tuesday evening, a garment trader from the Jamalpur area, Rizwan Pathan was travelling on his scooter near Raykhad. He crossed the stop-line when signal was closed. A traffic cop came to him and told him to take his scooter behind the stop-line, said an official of Gaekwad Haveli police.

Rizwan alleged that the traffic cop abused him while directing him to take his scooter behind the stop-line. This irked Rizvan who got into a quarrel with the cop. The traffic cop began abusing Rizwan and told him to park his vehicle on roadside to file a legal case against him.

Meanwhile, Rizwan called up his elder brother Sarfaraz who reached there in around 10 minutes and tried to negotiate with the cops. Rizwan began shooting a video of the traffic cop and other three policemen who were arguing aggressively with Sarfaraz.

One of the four cops spotted Rizwan and he along with others held him and began beating him. Sarfaraz was forced to sit inside an autorickshaw. But as he insisted to take his brother along, he too was beaten by the cops, said a police official.

The FIR filed with Gakwad Haveli police mentions that Rizwan and Sarfaraz were attacked by four cops in which Rizwan suffered wounds. But as he went to Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel hospital in the Ellisbridge area, a medico legal case was registered and later city police filed an FIR against four cops. As Rizwan’s FIR was registered with Gaekwad Haveli police, one of the four cops – Jagdishsinh Mohabbatsinh filed a complaint of causing hurt with E Traffic police where he has been deployed.

The FIR filed by traffic police also accused their own TRB (Traffic Regulation Brigade) jawan, Danish Naseer of abetment as the TRB jawan was repeatedly telling other cops that the duo live in his neighbourhood Jagdishsinh maintained in the FIR that the two tore off his uniform’s buttons and they had suffered injury accidentally as they fell on a table.

KOLKATA: The city zonal unit of the Directorate General of GST Intelligence (DGGI) on Tuesday unearthed a GST fraud of Rs 500 crore over multiple transactions. This was the fifth major case unearthed by the unit. Two persons were arrested in the case.

The accused is believed to be the brain behind the money laundering operation. They were produced at Sealdah court that remanded them to judicial custody till March 6. DGGI has also recovered Rs 5.8 crore from two firms. The total GST credit involved in the cobweb of transactions was Rs 96 crore.

According to DGGI, on scrutiny of the returns and documents, it prepared to carry out simultaneous search operations at 10 locations. These were, however, found to be non-existent. The companies existed only on paper and they were involved in the passage of fake invoices without supply of goods and services. “Hence, a huge amount of fake input tax credit was passed on to recipient companies across India who availed this fake credit of GST to meet their tax obligations, thus depriving the government of revenue,” a DGGI spokesperson said.

The money was paid through RTGS, to make the transactions appear regular, which was subsequently recircu-lated through a complex web of entities keeping the commission amount.

VISAKHAPATNAM: The government is planning to introduce whitetopping of roads in major cities, including Visakhapatnam .

Whitetopping of roads have already been introduced in cities such as Hyderabad, Bengaluru, Chennai and Delhi. The government has planned to adopt the new model on a pilot basis at select cities wherein the rate of damage to roads and vehicular traffic is high.

Speaking to TOI, state roads and buildings minister Dharmana Krishna Das said the whitetopping of roads is currently at the planning stage and there was no official proposal for the project so far. However, the government would study existing whitetopped roads in Hyderabad, Telangana and take a decision on it.

“We will discuss the viability of white-topping the roads with the officials concerned soon,” Krishna Das told TOI.

Jose Kurian, from Indian Concrete Institute (ICI), a national organisation of engineering professionals employed in concrete construction, said white-topping is the best alternative to check common problems in asphalt roads like potholes, especially, during monsoons.

Kurian said white-topping road is the covering of asphalt surface with a layer (approximately 100mm to 150mm) of concrete.

“The white-topping of road is widely accepted as the solution to preventing formation of potholes and making them durable. Not only will it reduce the number of accidents and causalities caused by potholes but also significantly enhance the driving comfort and save fuel,” Kurian added.

Speaking to TOI, Kurian said the cost of white-topping of roads would be nearly 25% more than laying asphalt roads, but the durability is guaranteed for nearly 25 years.

“We are ready to extend any technological support to any constructor, including the government, in white-topping project,” Kurian said while adding that the Kerala government would be converting nearly 1,400kms of asphalt roads into white-topped roads.

KOLKATA: J D Birla Institute on Lower Rawdon Street has made its campus plastic-free and set up vertical gardens, creating horticulture spaces with rainwater harvesting facilities. The Nature Club of the college conducts regular workshops to tackle plastic menace. Also, segregation of waste on the campus is strictly followed.“We have provided our students with bags made of eco-friendly material. They can use these instead of polythene bags. We conduct workshops and awareness sessions on how to eliminate plastic. Even the Saraswati Puja on the campus is organized using eco-friendly materials. We have vertical gardens in the campus made with plastic bottles contributed by our students. If any plastic waste is generated it is handed over to a specialized outfit, which earns us green credits,” JD Birla Institute principal Deepali Singhee said.In fact, several colleges across the city have banned plastic and combined eco-friendly measures with education to promote sustainable environmental practices.At Presidency University, use of plastic carry bags has been discontinued. But authorities admit they need to introduce more environment-friendly measures. Authorities at Ballygunge Science College, University of Calcutta, use paper bags and eco-friendly material at official functions and plastic bags are not used in the canteens. “We use paper bags and envelopes at functions. Material like styrofoam are prohibited,” said Samprikta Bose, an environmental science post-graduation student at Ballygunge Science College.In August last year, the University Grants Commission had directed colleges and universities to discontinue use of plastic on the campus and introduce eco-friendly measures to promote sustainable environmental practices.Bhawanipur Education Society authorities have replaced plastic bags with jute ones. At Heritage Institute of Technology, there are separate bins across the campus to segregate waste. The campus also has a 100kW solar power plant, which caters to a substantial part of the power requirement at the institute, cutting its electricity cost.“We discourage the use of plastic on the campus. There is a robust recycling facility. We also have rainwater harvesting facilities. We adhere to all the norms of the green building standards. We also hold frequent awareness sessions,” said Pradip Agarwal, CEO, Heritage Institute of Technology.Rajabazar Science College, too, has started using eco-friendly material instead of plastic.At Presidency University and Jadavpur University the authorities are formulating guidelines pertaining to the use of plastic and other non-biodegradable materials.",kolkata,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74333245,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-878500,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/college-goes-plastic-free-sets-up-vertical-garden/articleshow/74326562.cms

Naidu will first visit Pentavani Cheruvu at Pinagadi village and interact with the farmers living in areas where land is being pooled. Later, he will visit Vizianagaram district where he will address the public at various places and return to Visakhapatnam . He would attend the wedding of former minister Ayyannapatrudu’s younger son on February 28 and leave for Hyderabad.

YSRC leaders are preparing to hold a protest at the airport on Thursday to question him on why he is against setting up the executive capital in Visakhapatnam.

Meanwhile, TDP Greater Visakha president Vasupalli Ganesh Kumar has alleged that welfare schemes introduced in TDP’s government were stalled in the nine-month rule of YSRC. Ganesh, who is also an MLA, said that around 43,000 people were identified as beneficiaries for the housing scheme and were given pattas or required documents during the TDP government through the then GVMC commissioner M Harinarayan But now the number of beneficiaries have been reduced to 24,000, he alleged. The YSRC government has been forcibly pooling land for the construction of housing for the poor, he accused. “Is there any meaning in it, taking land of the poor and distributing or construction of houses for the poor,” he criticized.

NAGPUR: RTM Nagpur University (NU) has decided to postpone the M.Com third semester exam to March 21 as the late results of previous semester left very little time on students’ hands.

Earlier, NU had scheduled the exams to start from March 4. Chetankumar Masram , principal of a Tumsar college and NU senate member, said, “A group of students approached me on Monday and expressed concern over the lack of time to do any paperwork. Results were declared on February 22 and the next exams were beginning within two weeks. This was unfair to students who failed by hardly two or three marks. There was no way they would be able to apply for revaluation and get the result before the exams started.”

Masram then met with NU officials on Tuesday and was promised prompt action. “NU’s vice chancellor SP Kane said they had already planned for this after realizing the problems that students would face. Hence it resulted in smooth and fruitful discussions which is ultimately beneficial for students,” said Masram.

change of guard

Allahabad: As many as 125 academics from across the country are in the running for the coveted post of Allahabad University ( AU ) vice-chancellor, which fell vacant after professor RL Hangloo resigned on January 1.

The list of applicants includes nine professors of AU and a principal of one of the varsity’s constituent colleges. All eyes are now set on the formation of a three-member search committee for which AU is yet to convene a meeting of its executive council.

While two members will be nominated to the committee at the aforesaid meeting, the third will be nominated by the President in his capacity as the Visitor of the central university. The search panel will screen all applications and proceed further with interviewing short-listed candidates.

According to reports, of the nine AU professors who have thrown their hat in the ring, two already serve as vice-chancellor of state universities and one is a former VC. The list of aspirants also includes a professor of the arts faculty who in the past has vied for the post of VC in top state universities, including Allahabad-based Uttar Pradesh Rajarshi Tandon Open University (UPRTOU).

Other senior faculty members of AU who have applied include professors of English, botany, law and electronics and communication. If AU teachers are to be believed, the principal of AU’s constituent colleges is known for his close links with the RSS.

Rules say AU must select the new VC within 90 days of publishing the advertisement for the post. Since the varsity had published the ad on January 21, seeking applications within a month, it must find a new VC by April 19.

After scrutinising applications and interviewing applicants, the search committee is expected to forward names of three or five applicants to the Visitor. The final decision obviously rests with the President.

Allahabad: Tension gripped Kadipur and adjoining villages on Wednesday under Aspurdevsara police station of Pratapgarh following the mysterious disappearance of a 12-year-old boy .

The missing boy is identified as Adarsh Kumar Tiwari, nephew of the current village head Kadipur Rajesh Tiwari and son of Ramesh Tiwari. He is a student of class VIIIth at Navodaya Vidhya Mandir.

The incident, as per police, took place around 8:15 am on Wednesday when Adarsh left the house to purchase stationery from a nearby shop. When he did not turn up for more than an hour, the family members informed the police station concerned, suspecting abduction.

Gram Pradhan Rajesh Tiwari alleged that the family members had dialled 112 but the local police reached the spot around three hours after they were informed. He said that he also spoke to the senior police officials on call but even that didn’t escalate the police response.

Following the incident, a large number of villagers assembled at the house of the victim, demanding police authorities to find the child.

The villagers also alleged that the local police was too lax to recover the child.

Family members told police that an unidentified man on a bike had arrived at their house about three days back and was asking Adarsh for the ATM card of his father Ramesh. The boy had refused to entertain him who then had threatened him of dire consequences.

Meanwhile, deputy SP (Patti) said, “Thorough investigations are being made into the incident.”

KOLKATA: Workers of an engineering firm expert in demolition of the city’s insecure buildings are up against their toughest challenge yet. Bijay Shaw, the owner of the firm — who is known as the ‘demolition man’ in the Kolkata Municipal Corporation circles — was assigned to demolish a five-storied building on Lenin Sarani (beside Jyoti cinema) three weeks ago. Considering the building’s vulnerable nature and the threat it poses, municipal commissioner Khalil Ahmed issued a special express order for its demolition. The KMC building department asked Shaw to wrap up the job in a month’s time.Shaw, who boasts of pulling down several insecure buildings across the city, including some dangerous ones in Burrabazar-Posta area, however, is struggling with this project. In fact, the pace of the demolition work suffered a setback last week when concrete chunks fell on rows of shops on Nilmoni Halder Lane behind the century-old building.According to a KMC buildings department official, the demolition of the structure was given top priority as it posed a threat to not only pedestrians, but also the traffic on the busy thoroughfare. The building was first declared insecure over 10 years ago. The building was gutted in a fire in 2014. In 2016, a large concrete chunk fell on a tree, which in turn, got uprooted and fell on a running auto on Lenin Sarani, killing three passengers on the spot.Mayor Firhad Hakim finally ordered its demolition after he visited the area and took note of the locals’ complaints. However, demolition proved to be a Herculean task since the workers trained in demolition needed to pull down four load-bearing walls with little space left for the team to accommodate personnel or machines as the stairs of the building no longer exist.The building’s location between a busy Lenin Sarani and a densely populated Nilmoni Halder Lane increased the challenge. A chunk of concrete could do enough damage to lives and properties (shops). Mohammed Parvez, owner of a shop on Nilmoni Halder Lane, said he had a narrow escape after a large chunk of concrete fell on his shop on Thursday, damaging it badly. “I had gone out of the shop to have a cup of tea. But there is no guarantee that such freak accidents won’t happen during demolition of the building,” Parvez said.A KMC official conceded that there was real risk in pulling down the structure and, hence, they would rather wait for two more months to complete the demolition work. “We have tried using machines to wrap up the project, but failed as not enough space is available for operating them. On the contrary, use of machines led to the crumbling chunks. Now, we want to pull down the 25-foot walls manually to avoid a disaster,” he said.",kolkata,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74333293,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-668724,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/kmcs-demolition-man-faces-uphill-task-in-razing-crumbling-bldg-on-busy-lenin-sarani/articleshow/74326564.cms

NEW DELHI: For the family of Ankit Sharma, 26-year-old Intelligence Bureau official whose body was recovered on Wednesday, it’s a nightmare that will never end. He had “gone missing” around 5pm after he ventured out of his home in Chand Bagh, which has seen some of the worst rioting in northeast Delhi, to “take stock of the situation outside.”“There was a mob outside the house and they were burning everything,” recalled his mother, Sudha Sharma, sobbing. “He had seen them while on his way back home. He came here, put down his things and did not take even a drop of water before going out with a few neighbours to check what was wrong. He didn’t return.”The mother’s long wait ended around 12pm on Wednesday with the tragic news of her son’s death. A group of men had spotted a body in a drain in the neighbourhood around noon and dived in to fish it out. They recognised Ankit and informed his father. The body was then taken to Guru Teg Bahadur Hospital. He had been badly assaulted.As family and friends began to pour into the young official’s home, their anger and sense of betrayal was evident. They alleged that a local politician was responsible for the murder and added that police did not pay any heed when they told them that a mob had dragged Ankit away. It didn’t matter that his father, Ravinder Kumar, is in Delhi Police.“The mob consisted of at least 500 people. They had come prepared and there were petrol bombs stocked up in the politician’s house. Before we could even react, they overpowered him and dragged him away. We could not do anything,” said a neighbour, who claimed to have accompanied Ankit to the main road where the violence was taking place. TOI tried to speak to the politician but he did not respond.His father, Kumar, said they began to get worried when Ankit did not return at night. “We then went out to search for him at a Kashmere Gate trauma centre and AIIMS but couldn’t find him. So, we went to file a complaint at Khajuri Khas police station. We were sent back by them,” he said.Even as the issue became politicised and neighbours gathered outside the house and raised controversial slogans, the family continued to talk about the compassionate young man who balanced his duty and family perfectly. Sudha spoke of the last time she stepped out of her house. On Monday, Ankit had “forcefully” taken her to an ophthalmologist. Her vision was getting blurry and he insisted on taking her to the nearby clinic.“I have an elder son but Ankit was the caring one in the family...He made sure that I saw the doctor before he left for work two days ago. That was the last time I spent some time with him,” she said. Inconsolable, the mother kept asking for “justice for her son.”“A case of murder has been registered. All allegations are being probed,” said DCP northeast Ved Prakash Surya.Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal expressed his condolences. ""Such a tragic loss of life. The culprits must not be spared. 20 people have already lost their lives. So painful to watch people of Delhi suffering.

The water board had recently submitted designs, along with DPR, for the STPs to NRCD. The civic body needs nearly Rs 2,000 crore to Rs 5,000 crore central funds to execute the proposed plan. According to water board officials, the STPs will be constructed in a couple of years if all goes well.

Regarding land acquisition for the proposed STPs, an official said, “Water board has acquired the necessary land by coordinating with GHMC and other government agencies. Most of the STPs will come up on water board’s land.” The land is free from litigations, added the official.

PANAJI: Following up on his promise to implement the Goa 2035: vision and roadmap report, chief minister Pramod Sawant met with Padma Vibhushan Dr Raghunath Mashelkar and the Vibrant Goa Foundation to discuss the implementation of the report’s recommendations.

Sawant said that a taskforce will be constituted to review the vision document and provide inputs for a phase-wise implementation of the report in the state.

“I have taken a decision to form a task force. The task force will prepare a roadmap for the implementation of the Vision 2035 report,” said Sawant. “We discussed about various aspects of the Goa-Vision 2035 report and way to implement the suggestions in a phased manner.”

Mashelkar is the former Director General of the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research .

On the 59th Liberation Day, on December 19, 2019, Sawant announced that the recommendations would be implemented, and appealed to all stakeholders for support to make Goa golden.

The Goa 2035: vision and roadmap report was prepared by a high-level council and submitted to then chief minister Manohar Parrikar in July 2012 but the report was never implemented.

The ‘Goa Golden Jubilee Development Council’ (GGJDC), constituted on July 26, 2010 by the then Congress-led government was headed by Dr Mashelkar. Then Congress chief minister Digambar Kamat had tasked the council to conduct an in-depth analysis of education, environment and sustainable development, art and culture, trade and industry and make recommendations for the state government to implement.

Chairman of Vibrant Goa Foundation Nitin Kunkolienker said that the report’s broad outlines remain relevant but the finer points would require a few changes to account for the rapid strides made in technology and the global economy.

“The first thing that we have decided is to review the Goa-Vision 2035 report. Goa does not require multiple visions,” said Kunkolienker.

Representative Image

COLVA: Additional sessions court judge Dvijpla Patkar on Wednesday acquitted Ram Bharosh Manji, a native of Bihar, in the alleged rape and murder case of a woman at Canacona.

On January 31, 2014, Canacona police registered an offence for rape and murder upon the complaint of Shashikant Yesso Pagi, that an unidentified person raped and murdered his 54-year-old wife Vijaya S Pagi, while she was returning home.

The autopsy report indicated that the death of the deceased was due to manual strangulation and smothering, and and there was also evidence of head injuries and sexual assault.

The accused then stole her mobile phone and cash of Rs 500. The prosecution examined 46 witnesses in support of the case. Advocate Peter Fernandes appeared for the accused under the free legal aid scheme.

The rape and murder had caused a sensation in Canacona, with villagers protesting outside the police station for two days demanding that the case be transferred to the crime branch. The police had announced a reward of Rs 50,000 for anyone who could provide information about the assailant.

The government had transferred the case to the crime branch who charge-sheeted the case against Ram. The second accused Vikas Kumar Sao was charged with dishonestly receiving stolen property, and is currently absconding.

The proceedings against him are to continue under Section 299 CrPC. Ram had admitted to the police that he had sold the mobile phone to Vikas.

122,['27/02/2020'],Remembering the evergreen voice of Madurai Somu,"This story is from February 27, 2020

Chennai: He was one of the rare Carnatic vocalists who was a musician of the masses. So it comes as no surprise that Madurai S Somasundaram’s birth centenary celebrations are continuing for more than a year, with Sangita Kalanidhi Madurai Seshagopalan paying tributes to the master at Ragasudha Hall in Mylapore this weekend.

But if his parents had their way, rasikas may not have had the pleasure of knowing his mesmerizing voice. Somu, as he was popularly known, was the tenth child, who was initiated into music as a ‘shruti-petti’ accompanist. As a child he showed keen interest in vocal music, but those at home didn’t seem to approve. Belonging to the family of nagaswaram vidwan Srinivasa Pillai, he was expected to take up this instrument. But the headstrong boy, captivated by singing, joined the theatre group ""Boys Company"" on his own.

Bowing to his preference, his parents took him to veteran vocalists Abhirami Sasthriar and Sesham Bhagavathar. Later in 1930, he began taking lessons from Chitoor Subramaniam Pillai in the gurukulam style for 14 years, at the end of which he debuted on the stage at a concert in Tiruchendur in 1945.

A faithful to the grammar prescribed by music pundits, he never allowed this to imprison his creativity. One could equate the popularity of Somu with that of Madurai Mani Iyer. Somu’s music, his abilities in all domains of Carnatic music — the ‘alapana’, rendering of the ‘kriti’ and ‘swaraprastharam’ — was engrossing. He would explore known ragas to unknown depths.

His concert-framework had special time for Ragam Tanam Pallavi. His pallavis used to be tough on the accompanists who used to dread these. He always demanded the full-bench when it came to supporting (pakka vadhyam) laya artists. The picture of Somu at the centre, as if on a pivot swirling around, encouraging these performers is etched in the memory of those who frequented his concerts. His concerts would follow the pattern of temple nagaswaram concerts, commencing in the evening and extending into the small hours of the day with unflinching vitality. He tried to mimic the nagaswaram and it is well-established that his raga phrases were imitative of the nagaswaram ‘bhani’ (pattern).

During his concerts there was the less heavy phase where he used to sing self-composed Tamil pieces as ‘ragamalika’(in a string of ragas). His evergreen songs are ""Enna Kavi Padinalum"", ""Ullak Kovilil"" and ""Madumeikkum Kanna"". Listeners would not let him go without singing these. After he had made his conspicuous entry into cinema with ‘Deivam’ as a playback singer, requests included the number ""Maruthamalai Mamaniye"", a song that made him popular instantly among the masses.

In spite of being a star, Somu was easily accessible, amiable and an endearing personality. And probably his goodness of heart also reflected in his voice too. People used to say his voice would improve qualitatively, get stimulated, mellow and attain sweetness as the concert progressed — an eternal experience of rasikas.

Botcha Satyanarayana

VISAKHAPATNAM: Minister for Muncipal and urban administration, Botcha Satyanarayana has urged people of Visakhapatnam to question Naidu as to why he is opposing the setting up of the executive capital in Visakhapatnam.

Speaking to the media here on Wednesday, the minister lashed out at the TDP chief for allegedly claiming that land was being grabbed from people on the pretext of land pooling. The minister alleged that the people of Visakhapatnam district remember the manner in which names were changed in records and land was grabbed from farmers during the previous regime.

He clarified that land pooling was being taken up in the state for the construction of homes for the poor and added that the YSRC chief and chief minister YS Jaganmohan Reddy has insisted that people must be paid extra if their land was being pooled and not be cheated in any way. Regarding Visakhapatnam as executive capital, the minister pointed out that the government aims to develop Visakhapatnam on the lines of Benguluru and Mumbai. “The opposition parties must put an end to its meaningless opposition to the idea of a decentralised capital and stop opposing everything the government does,” Botsa Satyanarayana said.

When asked why the chief minister was not invited to the official dinner hosted at Rashtrapathi Bhavan for the US President, Donald Trump, Satyanarayana replied, “ Chief ministers like Naveen Patnaik and Mamta Banerjee were also not invited.”

Pinarayi Vijayan

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM/KOZHIKODE: Chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan called for urgent intervention by the Centre to bring back normalcy in Delhi. Among the people in Delhi, there are thousands of Keralites who are living under fear. Hence, the centre should intervene immediately to put an end to the violence, he said in a statement issued here.

“There are reports that rumours are being spread to create communal hatred in Delhi. The death toll is increasing and even the media are not being spared. The BJP leader who gave hate speech is still creating trouble. He has not been arrested till now. The law and order has been completely deteriorated,” said the chief minister adding that the home ministry should not hesitate in taking action against the perpetrators of violence. “Police should be effectively deployed to prevent spread of violence. The government has the responsibility to check communal hatred being spread in the society.”

“The anti-CAA agitation is to protect the secular credentials of the country. However, the Sangh Parivar’s agenda is to take this agitation to the streets. This has resulted in the violence in Delhi. All the secular forces should come together to bring peace in the national capital,” said the chief minister.

Meanwhile, a delegation of the Indian Union Muslim League ( IUML ) is planning to visit riot-hit areas in Delhi on Thursday and also meet senior leaders including AICC president Sonia Gandhi.

The working committee of the party met here on Wednesday and expressed concern over the gruesome violence in Delhi. The meeting chaired by party president Panakkad Syed Hyder Ali Shihab Thangal said the central government failed to ensure safety and security of life and property.

Leaders also said even the police, instead of stopping the violence, stood as mute spectators to the rampage unleashed by the Sangh Parivar.

The meeting demanded the resignation of home minister Amit Shah for failing to protect lives. IUML also asked the police to arrest BJP leader Kapil Mishra for sedition.

An IUML delegation comprising national general secretary P K Kunhalikutty, organizing secretary E T Muhammad Basheer, treasurer P V Abdul Wahab, state general secretary K P A Majeed, assembly party leader M K Muneer and Lok Sabha party whip Navas Ghani would meet Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal, AICC president Sonia Gandhi and home minister Amit Shah to discuss the prevailing situation.

The meeting also expressed concern over the LDF government’s move to sabotage anti-CAA agitations. The Kerala police have been registering cases against those who have been staging peaceful anti-CAA protest. IUML also criticized chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan for insulting Justice Kemal Pasha who has taken a strong stand against the CAA .

The party will organize get-togethers at panchayat and ward levels on March 10, which is the party's founding day.

NEW DELHI: The alleged hate speeches by BJP functionaries Kapil Mishra , Anurag Thakur and Parvesh Verma came under the scrutiny of Delhi high court on Wednesday, which said it was “amazed” and “anguished” that police hadn’t lodged FIRs against them.

Playing in the courtroom video clips of each controversial speech made by the three BJP members in connection with the CAA-related violence, a bench of Justices S Muralidhar and Talwant Singh said they “ex facie appear to be answering the description of the crime of hate speech in terms of IPC Section 153A proviso (a) and (b), both of which are cognisable and non-bailable.”

The court directed the Delhi Police commissioner to view all the clips and any other that police may have received in this connection and take a “conscious decision” by Thursday.

“What is an appropriate stage? When the whole city has burnt down? How many more lives are to be lost before action is taken? Unless you don’t take action now, how will a conducive situation arise?” the bench demanded from Solicitor General Tushar Mehta when he maintained that police were in possession of the clips, but were waiting for a conducive time since the atmosphere was charged now.

Disagreeing with Mehta’s stand, the bench was quick to point out the “consequences” of police inaction against hate speech. “Has the police commissioner seen these videos? If you don’t have an FIR, how are you going to proceed? Three speeches have given way to more speeches. You acted with alacrity in cases of loot and arson. Why was no similar action shown in the case of these speeches?” the bench wondered, referring to BJP MLA Abhay Verma’s alleged speech in Laxmi Nagar.

The bench asked special commissioner Praveer Ranjan to convey the “anguish of a constitutional court” to the commissioner and recorded that the senior officer had assured he would sit with the police commissioner, view all video clips, take a decision of lodging FIRs and convey it to the court on Thursday.

“We want peace to prevail. We do not want the city to witness another 1984 riots. This city has seen enough violence and anguish,” the bench said, questioning the police’s reluctance when it had lodged 11 cases in incidents including arson, looting and stone-pelting in the past week.

The order was issued while hearing a petition by human rights activist Harsh Mander and activist Farah Naqvi. Appearing for the petitioners, senior advocate Colin Gonsalves said not just FIR, the BJP members should be arrested and jailed.

The hearing, held in a jampacked courtroom, saw Mehta and Delhi Police standing counsel Rahul Mehra differ on registration of FIRs. While Mehta argued that the court should wait for police to file its response and not pass any interim orders, Mehra contended an FIR should be registered if a cognisable offence had been committed and, later, if enough evidence is not found, a cancellation report could be filed.

Mehta also objected to why the “public spirit” of the petitioners, including Mander, woke up “in the case of three individuals when there were 50 such clips from all sides.” He argued that any step at this stage by the court would aggravate the situation. However, the court countered, “The situation out there is so unpleasant. We have all watched videos of some leaders making hate speeches openly. There are videos that hundreds of people have watched. Do you still think it’s not an urgent matter?”

While watching Mishra’s video, the bench also asked the name of the police officer seen standing next to the BJP functionary and was informed by Gonsalves that it was DCP (Northeast) Ved Prakash Surya.

HYDERABAD: A mosque in Shantinagar area of AC Guards will open its doors for hundreds of students, and help them prepare for various competitive exams including national eligibility cum entrance test (NEET) for medical courses, and civil services.

Experts drawn from various fields will train students on how to plan, prepare and appear for competitive examinations at national and state level. Classes will be held at the expert coaching centre daily from March 2 for students planning to take entrance tests for various professional courses beginning next academic year. Separate classes will be held those appearing for public service exams.

The first floor of Alamgir mosque near Mahavir Hospital has been allotted for the coaching-cum-study centre. The coaching programme called “connect with mosque”, will be held during nights and students can use the mosque premises to prepare for competitive exams. Apart from experts, there will be trained teachers to guide students. This is the first time in Hyderabad that a mosque will double up as a coaching centre for academic and career enhancement.

Syed Ata Hussain Anjum, president of Alamgir Masjid committee, told TOI that they had taken up an educational-cum-job coaching campaign, “Excel 2020 plus”, to keep students abreast of latest developments in all fields and to enable them to crack tough competitive examinations.

“Many students cannot afford tuition fee to take coaching at leading coaching centres,” he said.

“Also, many families do not have enough space at home for students to study in a serene atmosphere. We provide motivational programmes and coaching by teachers to hone the competitive skills of poor students.”

Mosque committee secretary, Basha Mohiuddin: “We will ensure students get at least two hours of expert attention daily. Classes will be held for students of classes VIII to X, intermediate and degree courses. There will be separate sessions for those appearing for competitive exams in medicine, law, engineering.”

Salar Jung Museum board member and educationist, Syed Zakir Hussain, said the mosque committee had decided to extend the scope of a masjid beyond prayers. “Classes will start after Isha prayers (about 8pm). Students can study in the mosque till the Fajr prayers (around 5am). Mobile phones will not be allowed, and students need to deposit them at an exclusive counter before entering the mosque,” Zakir said.

Muslim residents guarding a temple against marauding mobs

NEW DELHI: While northeast Delhi was caught in a communal frenzy, Indira Vihar, a locality in Shiv Vihar, proved gallantly different. There are 3,200 houses in the area, and a mere eight of them belong to Hindu families. To save them from the mob, the residents even changed the nameplate on a pickle maker’s shop and guarded a temple. “Whether it is Diwali or a cremation, we have always been at each other’s side, so why not today?” reasoned Wasim.

Delhi violence: Live updates

On Wednesday, three Muslim men stood guard outside the temple in Indira Vihar. One of them told TOI, “We have always lived in peace together. A place of worship should not be damaged.” Nearby a house had a slip of paper with “Parwaiz Ansari” pasted on the blue door. While a cloth covered the wall ledge, underneath it idols of Saraswati, Hanuman and other gods could be espied. The house belongs to a Hindu pickle maker, and the subterfuge saved the man, his wife and two children from harm.

Nandlal, locally addressed as mathri-maker Panditji’s son, said with much relief, “We are safe because of the people living in the two lanes. No one has allowed an outsider to venture there, and even if someone does come into the area, they are prevented from coming anywhere near our house. We might not know everyone by name, but do recognise most people by face.”

Tasleem Ansari has been a neighbour and best friend to the Sainis living opposite his house. Ansari said, “Shiv Vihar is burning because of outsiders, not because of its residents.” He said that there is social interaction among all the people and they visit each other’s houses. Ansari said the elderly Sainiji, head of the family, had died recently, but his son Pankaj and his wife lived here. Neeraj, the other son, lived in Maujpur. When two Saini women married, the entire neighbourhood joined in to help, and the Hindu family has always reciprocated by visiting their neighbours’ homes on Eid. “The two brothers hadn’t been able to meet because of the violence, so Pankaj has gone to Neeraj’s house only today,” Ansari said.

Tara Dev, one of the Hindu residents, said “In our three decades living here, we have never had any issue with our neighbours. They are our brothers and sisters. Today, many of them are on vigil outside our house and we know we are safe.”

At Chand Bagh too, Praveen Kumar was all praise for his Muslim neighbours. “They saved our temple from destruction and went out of their way to ensure harmony even in this deadly situation.”

A reciprocal story unfolded in Brijpuria Puliya. Akhtar Raza, a member of BJP’s minority cell, was at the Faruqia mosque where anti-CAA protests were taking place. When a mob attacked them, Raza, by his own testimony, stated that he and his family wouldn’t be alive if not for his Hindu neighbours.

Raza said the rioters went around identifying Muslim homes and attacking the panicky people. Six such houses were burnt down. “Our Hindu neighbours helped us escape and many of us have moved in with our relatives,” said Raza.

Allahabad: The Allahabad high court on Wednesday stayed a lower court’s order to proceed with the hearing of a case related to Kashi Vishwanath Temple-Gyanvapi Masjid dispute in Varanasi.

On February 4, 2020, the Varanasi lower court had held that since in writ petition related to the dispute pending before the Allahabad high court no interim order was extended in the past six months, the stay is deemed to be vacated as per the ruling of the Supreme Court in 'Asian Resurfacing of Road Agencies case' and it can resume hearing of the case.

One of the parties, Anjuman Intazamia Masjid of Varanasi challenged the decision of the Varanasi civil court. Hearing the petition, Justice Ajay Bhanot fixed March 17, 2020 as the next date of hearing of this case. The petitioner's contention was that it had earlier filed a petition related to the dispute and court had granted a stay order in the case directing civil court not to proceed in the case pending before it. However, the civil court wrongly interpreted the order of the Supreme Court and held that since the said order was not extended by the high court in the past six months, the stay is deemed to be vacated and now, it can resume hearing of the case, the petition said.

In the orginial petition filed before the Varansi civil court in 1991, KV Mandir Trust had contended that the kashi Vishwanath temple was built by Maharaja Vikramaditya about 2050 years ago. According to the Trust's petition, Mughal emperor Aurangzeb destroyed the temple in 1664 and used the remains of the temple to construct a mosque on a portion of the land, which is known as Gyanvapi masjid.

The Trust requested the lower court to issue directives for the removal of the mosque on the temple land and give back the possession of the land to the temple trust. The trust had contended in the original suit that the Places of Worship (Special Provisions) Act was not applicable on its suit as the mosque was constructed over a partly demolished temple and even today many parts of the temple exist.

In 1998, Anjuman Intazamia Masjid, Varanasi, moved the high court with contention that the mandir-masjid dispute could not be adjudicated by a civil court as it was barred by the law.

The high court then had stayed the proceedings at the lower court which continued for the past 22 years. In February this year, the trust approached the lower court again with a plea to resume the hearing as the HC had not extended the stay in the past six months.

134,['27/02/2020'],Telugu Ganga water for Chandragiri villages,"This story is from February 27, 2020

Tirupati: The state government passed a government order on Wednesday allocating 130 million cubic feet of water from the Telugu Ganga project to Chandragiri assembly constituency.

The move is aimed to mitigate the drinking water problems faced by several villages in the perennially drought-hit district of Chittoor.

Following a representation from Chandragiri MLA Chevireddy Bhaskar Reddy, who is also the chairman of Tirupati Urban Development Authority (TUDA), the government passed the order to release the water from the Telugu Ganga project to meet the drinking water needs of Settipalli, Padmavathipuram, Sai Nagar, Avilala, Vedantapuram, Peruru, Tiruchanoor and Tummalagunta gram panchayats.

Bhaskar Reddy, who is also the government whip in the assembly, expressed his thanks to chief minister Jaganmohan Reddy for providing a permanent solution to the drinking water woes faced by the people of Chandragiri constituency which continues to reel under extreme drought conditions year after year.

He also took a dig at TDP chief N Chandrababu Naidu for not trying to alleviate the drinking water problems of the area during his 14-year-long stint as chief minister of the state.

“Chief minister YS Jaganmohan Reddy understands the sufferings of people and takes prompt decisions to mitigate their problems. People of Chandragiri have staged several protests for more than three decades to address their drinking water problems, but successive governments didn’t pay any heed to their appeals. Now they will receive 368 crore litres of assured water supply from the Telugu Ganga project every year,” he said.

135,['27/02/2020'],AU panel to vet student body’s future today,"This story is from February 27, 2020

Allahabad: Allahabad University’s (AU) academic council will decide about the fate of Students Council and whether the varsity should continue awarding degrees to Ewing Christian College during its meeting on Thursday.

The decision on the body is a much-awaited one in the wake of the frequent protests which were reported after the varsity replaced the AU Students’ Union with a Students Council in 2019.

In June 2019, AU replaced the students union with a student council and the move was endorsed by the varsity’s Executive Council too.

The Students Council elections were held on the campus and also in other constituent colleges in October 2019. However, all 23 students who had filed nomination for various posts of the body withdrew their names at the last minute. Without any candidates to contest the election, the Students Council elections were subsequently cancelled.

“AU’s Academic Council will discuss the future of the students representative body. It will decide if the Students Council would continue to exist or if the students union will be reinstated,” said one of the head of departments at AU, who would be attending Thursday’s meeting.

The council would also discuss if the varsity should continue awarding AU degrees to Ewing Christian College (ECC) students.

Last month, AU’s examination committee had decided to discontinue with the practice as the constituent college conducts its own admission process, sets question papers itself and even evaluates the answer sheets independently.

“The meeting would be convened at 11am in the North Hall and several important issues would be discussed, ” said AU public relations officer Shailendra Mishra.

BJP national general secretary Muralidhar Rao

GUNTUR: Defending the Citizenship Amendment Act ( CAA ), BJP national general secretary Muralidhar Rao said the Centre has brought in the legislation to protect India from intruders.

He said there was nothing in CAA that harmed the interests of Muslims. He said it was unfortunate that opposition have been spreading false information to create apprehensions in society.

Addressing a meeting organized to create awareness among the SCs and STs here on Wednesday, Rao said BJP would not enact laws for political gains. “I demand anyone to show one single sentence or clause in CAA that goes against the interests of the India-born Muslims. We are ready to quit active politics,” said Rao. He said it was unfortunate that some intellectuals were creating unneeded confusion and trouble in the country.

He said BJP is committed for the uplift of Dalits and tribals. He said interests of the nation were paramount for them rather than partisan political benefits.

He explained various features of the CAA at the meeting and how it would benefit those migrated to India after being persecuted in neighbouring Muslim-dominant nations like Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan.

Rao said that Prime Minister Narendra Modi had included a Dalit in the Ayodhya Ram Mandir Trust as he believes that nation would not progress without the presence of dalits.

BJP state president Kanna Lakshminarayana said opposition were resorting to smear campaign as they could not take on Modi. Party senior functionaries Ravela Kishore Babu, Sunil Deodhar, Satish Ji, Paturi Nagabhushanam were also present during the occasion.

Speaking to media later in the day, Rao said BJP was not against reservations to the SCs, STs.

139,['27/02/2020'],Cheque bounce case: HC to hear plea against acquittal,"This story is from February 27, 2020

Allahabad: The Allahabad High Court has held that in offences pertaining to cheque bounce, the appeal against acquittal of accused by the subordinate court can be moved before the high court under provisions of criminal procedure code. Hence, no such appeal would lie before the sessions judge of the district court.

The court further held that against the same judgment and acquittal order in a complaint case, where the victim and complainant are different persons, the appeal by the victim can be made only before the high court.

Section 138 of Negotiable Instrument Act provides for circumstances under which a complaint case can be filed in the case of dishonour (bounce) of cheques.

These two key questions were referred to court in the case of Anil Kumar Agarwal and others versus State of Uttar Pradesh. A division bench comprising Justice Shashi Kant Gupta and Justice Saurabh Shyam Shamshery directed the Registrar General of high court to ensure circulation of this order among all judicial officers in the state for their guidance.

The court further directed that a copy of this order be sent to the chief secretary, principal secretary (law) and legal remembrance and stamp reporter of high court for taking follow-up action.

A criminal offence is made out under Section 138 Negotiable Instrument Act, where cheques bounce due to inadequate funds in the account of the person who issues it or due to any other reason.

The question referred before the division bench of high court was whether against acquittal order in a criminal complaint case filed under Section 138 Negotiable Instrument Act, the victim, who is a complainant also may prefer appeal before the sessions judge at district court or the appeal can be made before high court under section 372 of CrPC.

Another question referred was if the victim and complainant both are different persons, the victim may file appeal before sessions judge or high court.

The police said Verma had only stated his position on the ongoing protest at Shaheen Bagh

NEW DELHI: “Gaddar,” which means traitor, does not signify any particular section of society, said Delhi Police stressing that no cognisable offence was found for lodging an FIR against BJP minister Anurag Thakur and MP Parvesh Verma over the “inflammatory” speeches made during Delhi assembly elections.

CPM leaders Brinda Karat and K M Tewari had sought an FIR against Thakur for allegedly leading a chant ""desh ke gaddaron ko, goli maaro saalon ko"" in reference to persons who participated in ""peaceful protests against the CAA"". Verma allegedly threatened protesters of Shaheen Bagh.

“Connotation of the word—gaddar is traitor. It does not point to any particular section of the society. Surmises and conjectures cannot be the basis of initiating any legal action,” stated Delhi Police’s status report following a magesterial court’s direction for an action taken report.

The police said Verma had only stated his position on the ongoing protest at Shaheen Bagh. “He has nowhere given any threat of any unlawful action and has just stated that protesters will be removed after BJP comes to power,” stated the report.

During his interview, the Delhi police said that he was pointing at a group of protesters and not any particular community. “He is not provoking the crowd to start any riot or take any retaliatory action against the protesters,” police’s report said.

Kapil Baisla, who was arrested after a firing incident at Shaheen Bagh, seems to have not attributed his act to the speeches of either Thakur or Verma, according to the police. Another incident that took place on February 1 relating to a minor, who shot at unarmed protesters outside Jamia Millia, was stated to be under investigation with the crime branch. He too, it was stated, hadn’t attributed his role to either of the speeches.

Delhi Police has dealt with another allegation of a video posted on January 31, 2020, on the party’s official Instagram handle over CAA protesters. It said, ""The speaker has only stated his own view regarding the ongoing protest in Shaheen Bagh. Call for removal of protesters does not construe to causing any unlawful action.""

The police called these “independent acts,” which didn’t have connection with the speeches. ""However, legal opinion is being sought on the complaint. In view of it, some more time may kindly be granted to submit a final ATR on the complaint,"" it added.

The court will pass its order on the issue on March 2.

The applicants have sought a direction to the Parliament Street police station to register an FIR against the BJP leaders for promoting enmity between different groups on grounds of religion, race, place of birth, residence, language, etc; imputations, assertions prejudicial to national-integration; deliberate and malicious acts, intended to outrage religious feelings of any class by insulting its religion or religious beliefs; uttering, words, etc, with deliberate intent to wound the religious feelings of any person; intentional insult with intent to provoke breach of the peace; public mischief and criminal intimidation.

Thiruvananthapuram: The city corporation made a tentative list of five stretches for day and night live vending zones; the project which was approved by state cabinet last week.

Kazhakootam–Technopark, Karamana–Killipaalam, Kowdiar–Kuravankonam, Poojapura–Kunchalumoodu and Vellayambalam–Sasthamangalam stretches are being considered for the vending zones.

A meeting was held in corporation main office on Wednesday and a steering committee meeting was also convened by city corporation. The shortlist prepared by the meeting will be presented in the council meeting scheduled to be held in the first week of March.

An inter-departmental meeting comprising various officials was also held recently. The local self-government department (LSGD) issued a directive to city corporation on Thursday to select the suitable spots for day and night live vending zones within 10 days.

The corporation will also have to allot zones for food trucks and vendors with FSSA license to function from 10pm to 5am on Friday and Saturday.

While the civic body has made an initial list, it has to weigh a few factors which should align with the criteria laid down by LSGD.

LSGD in its order has said that proposed zones should have sufficient parking facilities, facilities like footpath and cycle path. Special focus will be on implementation of green protocol and sanitation.

The police and security staff will oversee the security arrangements in live vending zones.

LED streetlights and free WiFi will be other requirements at live vending zones. While corporation plans to co-ordinate with police regarding parking and security arrangements, the other aspects like path for cycling, facilities like free WiFi will have to be considered by city corporation.

The initial list has been prepared mainly considering stretches which are already abuzz with some activity late into the night. The Kazhakkoottam–Technopark stretch is high on the list, as many of the shops especially eateries are open during late hours at night along this stretch.

The ongoing flyover works and resultant traffic regulations in place at Kazhakkoottam is also being taken into account by corporation while finalizing the stretch from Technopark to Kazhakootam for day and night live vending zone.

The project conceived by the state government aims at a live commercial zone in addition to eateries.

The state government is planning to launch the pilot scheme in the capital by March 31 and LSGD, which is co-ordinating the project, is keen on getting the live vending zones functional in the city even before March 31 so that it could be emulated in other cities in the state.

The government aims to implement the project with various objectives; the primary one being promotion of tourism. The government has assessed that it is important to have live and secure streets and vending zones for the promotion of tourism in the state. Besides, it is expected to create new employment opportunities not just for hoteliers but for entertainment sector and small-scale traders.

Agra: A Special Investigation Team (SIT) was constituted on Wednesday to probe all cases registered after the violent clashes between anti CAA protesters and police in Aligarh on Sunday. Senior police officials, accompanied by religious leaders, also took out a peace march in the city to restore confidence among the public. Police, meanwhile, booked 250 persons, including six AMU students, for violating prohibitory orders by blocking a road and unlawful assembly at Quarsi bypass road in Jeevangarh area.

Mobile Internet services remained suspended in Aligarh for the third consecutive day on Wednesday and will continue to be off till further orders, said DM CB Singh.

Aligarh SSP Muniraj G said all the 12 FIRs, registered at various police stations in Aligarh after Sunday’s violence will be probed by a SIT, headed by SP (crime) Arvind Kumar. The SSP said the situation in the city was under control but protests are being held at three different places across the city, including in Shahjamal area, the road opposite the old change gate of AMU and in Quarsi bypass-Anoop Shahar road.

Talking to TOI, SP (crime) Arvind Kumar said a peace march was taken out in the city in presence of ADG (Agra zone) Ajay Anand, SSP Muniraj G and religious leaders of various communities to spread the message of brotherhood and restore confidence among the residents. Around 1,000 people participated in the peace march.

Circle officer Anil Samaniya told TOI that all the 250 persons, including five women students of AMU and the varsity's students leader, were booked in the latest FIR under IPC sections 149 (unlawful assembly), 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant), 291 (public nuisance), 150 (hiring or conniving at hiring of persons to join unlawful assembly) and 341 (wrongful restraint) along with section 83 of the Juvenile Justice (Care And Protection of Children) Act of 2015 for allegedly ‘using’ children during anti-CAA protest at quasi police station.

One of the student leaders, booked by police, told TOI that he had gone to address an anti-CAA protest demonstration and the allegation levelled against him by police that he shouted slogans in support of a former research scholar-turned-Hizbul terrorist, Mannan Wani, is baseless. He claimed that he was being victimized for being a Kashmiri.

According to a senior police officer, the situation in the area continues to be tense, specially after the Delhi riots, and there are reports that some residents have collected stones on their terrace. The officer said this came to the notice of the authorities during monitoring of the areas with drones. House owners who have collected stones will be issued notices soon, he said.

148,['27/02/2020'],Judgment in Behmai massacre case adjourned for fifth time,"This story is from February 27, 2020

Kanpur: The much-awaited judgment in the Behmai massacre case was adjourned for the fifth time on Wednesday on the ground that the original case diary is not in the court file.

The specially constituted court has now fixed March 18 as the next date for further orders. It has directed the office to write a letter to DGP and inform him that the original case diary is missing from the court file.

Earlier, the court had adjourned its verdict on January 18, 24, 30 and February 12 respectively on the same ground.

According to DGC (criminal), Rajiv Porwal, the court had issued the letter to SP Kanpur Dehat Anurag Vats about missing of the case diary. The SP on Wednesday informed the court that the original case diary was not with the police.

When asked what is the use of the case diary when the trial has concluded and the court is to pronounce the verdict, the DGC said the case diary is a document in which an investigation officer mentions about the investigation conducted in a case and records statements in writing. It is submitted in the court at the time of filing of a chargesheet, he added.

The court, he said, provides copy of the chargesheet to the accused before commencement of trial.

The defence, at the time of prosecution evidence, uses copy of the case diary to match the statements recorded under section 161 of CrPC during investigation and point out any addition in the statements or facts. “This phase was already over. As per practice, now the case diary has no use except to keep it in record”, the DGC said.

Abhimanyu Kumar Sachan, a senior advocate, talking to TOI said, “The apex court had held that case diary is a part of the case file and judicial official can take its help at the time of judgment”. If original case diary is missing and its photo copy is on the record, then judgment can be delivered, he added.

The DGC said the court munsarim (head clerk) had mentioned in his report that the photocopy of the case diary was on the file.

The Behmai carnage case was filed against over 36 dacoits, including Phoolan Devi on February 14, 1981 but at present it is being heard against four dacoits--Posa, Bheekha, Vishwanath alias Krishna Kumar alias Putani and Shyam Sundar, four dacoits are absconding and the remaining, including Phoolan Devi, had either died or killed in police encounters.

Behmai massacre had shaken the entire country as this was the first case in which the dacoits had killed over 20 villagers.

154,['27/02/2020'],Christians ‘ashed’ their sins as Lent opens with Ash Wednesday,"This story is from February 27, 2020

Indore: Churches in city were crowded with hundreds of devotees for the holy Eucharistic mass of Ash Wednesday , which opens Lent , the 40-day period of abstinence and deprivation for Christians before Easter.

Considered as a time for introspection and sacrifice, during Ash Wednesday Christians confessed their sins and professed their devotion to God . Priests at the churches placed ashes in the shape of a cross on foreheads of the devotees to remind them that they are made of dust and will return to dust. The ash put up on the forehead is made of the palm leaves used previous year for the Palm Sunday.

The 40-day period of repentance also leads to Palm Sunday, Maundy Thursday and Good Friday. Bearing in mind the message of Pope Francis for Lent Dr Chacko Thottumarickal also encouraged devotees to pray continually since prayer is more than an obligation and it always precedes and sustains people.

Besides praying, most of the christians believe in refraining from doing anything or any habit that they find extremely difficult to stay away from or think is unpleasant in the sight of God. Mostly people fast by doing so, devotees try to imitate Christ's fasting for 40 days in the desert.

During Lent season, ‘Way of the Cross’, a prayer which represent different stages of Jesus Christ’s journey on the cross that finally ended with his crucifixion is prayed on every Wednesday and Friday.

All the catholic churches of Indore conducted holy Eucharistic mass twice- in morning and evening- for the devotees.

“Attending the holy mass on Ash Wednesday is a tradition. Families consider it mandatory. But due to hectic work schedule in morning, people mostly come for it in the evening,” a devotee Emily D’souza told TOI.

“Every year, I don’t eat non-vegetarian meals for 40 days and also refrain from becoming angry,” she added.

Dehradun: Protesting against reservation in promotion, hundreds of state government employees from OBC and general categories took out a mashaal (torch) rally in the city. The agitating employees also burnt the effigy of Union minister Ram Vilas Paswan who recently hailed reservation system and stated that the job reservation will stay put till caste system exists in the country.

Deepak Joshi, president of General-OBC Workers’ Organisation of Uttarakhand, told TOI, “Over eight thousand employees have been awaiting their promotion since several years. These employees work in departments ranging from education, health, transport, and others. Now that the Supreme Court order on promotion in reservation has come, the state government must not delay our promotions any further. If our demands are not met by the month end, the employees will sit on strike.”

Joshi further said that more than two lakh members of the General-OBC organisation across the hill state have joined the protests in various districts. “The Supreme Court has already ruled in our favour. We believe that there should be no reservations in promotions and it is unfair to subvert the directions of the Supreme Court. We will not suffer injustice anymore,” added Joshi.

Meanwhile, the state government employees from Scheduled Caste (SC) and Scheduled Tribe (ST) communities have threatened to launch mass protest in the state if they aren’t given reservation in promotion. The state government has already formed a sub-committee with three ministers to handle this matter.

Hundreds of unemployed youths also launched protests in the state on Tuesday over the recent instance of cheating in the forest guard recruitment exam and alleged failure of state government to provide jobs. The agitators continued their protest outside secretariat on Wednesday. The police detained some of the protesters who tried to break police barricades but they were later released in the evening. The protesters were claiming that they will not leave the spot until the chief minister meets them.

Secunderabad: The Secunderabad Cantonment Board’s triennial revision of the property tax for 2018-2021 has not gone down well among the residents as they claim the SCB does not even provide basic amenities to them.

On February 24, the SCB revised tax for domestic properties at between Rs 1.20 and Rs 1.80 per square feet and Rs 4 per square feet to Rs 12 per square feet for commercial properties.

Demanding immediate withdrawal of the revision, Telukunta Arunjyothi Satish Gupta, a social activist said, “If the SCB needs money for development, it should seek pending Rs 500 crore from the Centre and Rs 80 crore from the state government.” TNN

161,['27/02/2020'],BJP banks on youth to lead party,"This story is from February 27, 2020

Mangaluru: The ongoing organisational drive undertaken by the state unit of the BJP is banking on the youth . While presidents of all district units of the party are less than 50, new presidents of the respective assembly constituency units are less than 40. The party will rally around the leadership of these young leaders with seniors chipping in with their experience and counsel, says Nalin Kumar Kateel , state BJP chief.

This is an ideal way for the party to build second and third line of leadership going forward, says Nalin, who was himself ushered into the state party chief’s role by the central party leadership, despite the presence of many senior leaders.

The presidents of the district units will be supreme at their levels within the party forum and seniors, contemporaries and juniors alike, will take cue from their leadership, and carry out their bidding in the interest of the party, Nalin says.

However, in the public forum, party leadership will play second fiddle and elected representatives will be the the party’s face, Nalin adds. “There will be mutual respect between party leadership and elected representatives, and they will acknowledge others roles in respective areas of influence, and work collectively in the larger interest of the party. There is absolutely no scope for one-upmanship, as the party is larger than individuals,” he adds.

This is the mantra that the party under the guidance of national president Jagat Prakash Nadda has adopted, as the BJP strives to expand its cadre base. “We have 37 organisational districts, up from 36, that the party had until recently, and the party has elected presidents to 35 of these district units. Presidents of the remaining two districts will be elected shortly,” Nalin said, adding the entire process is carried out in a transparent, democratic fashion.

In choosing the young and energetic party cadre to hold positions of responsibility, the BJP is merely reminding them that these are not posts that one can merely flaunt on their visiting cards, but one they have to really shoulder over the next three years, Nalin said. The party office-bearers have the onerous responsibility of taking its ideology to every single booth across Karnataka, and will need a whole lot of teamwork and cooperation, Nalin asserts.

Thiruvananthapuram: Varkala police, on Wednesday, arrested a 37-year-old man who robbed a French tourist .

Police identified the accused as Sujith from Paravur in Kollam. He was working as a staff at one of the restaurants on Varkala Cliff.

Police said that the crime took place early on Sunday. Arif Fatealy (28), who hails from France, is the complainant in the case.

The accused allegedly robbed a gold chain, weighing two sovereigns, from the complainant. The crime happened on the main beach at Varkala below the helipad where the complainant was spending time with his girlfriend. As it was dark and the beach was almost empty, the robber could snatch the chain and run away.

Police said Fatealy had arrived here in the first week of February and was staying at a resort, ‘The Lungi Vibe’ at Thiruvambadi beach. A few days later, the woman, who was with him at the time of the crime, arrived from the Netherlands. They both met here and grew closer.

After the crime happened, the complainant told the police that the robber was wearing a kurti with the word ‘Om’ printed on it in English. As part of the investigation, police collected surveillance camera footages for the past one week from all commercial establishments in the area and found the accused wearing that kurti in one of the visuals.

The complainant saw the video and identified the accused following which he was taken into custody. The police also recovered the gold chain, which the accused had sold at a jewelry shop in Attingal.

Police recorded his arrest on Wednesday and produced him before the local magistrate, who remanded him in judicial custody.

The accused was arrested by a team led by Varkala station house officer inspector G Gopakumar and SI MG Shyam.

Hyderabad: When it comes to luxury, especially automobiles, the city of Nizams has been streets ahead of some of its other metro counterparts. But now the city seems to be racing ahead even when it comes to sustainable luxury.

Japanese auto major Toyota Motor Corp, which marked its entry into the luxury segment in India with the rollout of its Vellfire self-charging hybrid electric multipurpose vehicle at an all-India price tag of Rs 79.5 lakh here on Wednesday, has bagged 20% of its total bookings for the newage MPV from Hyderabad.

Toyota has mopped up around 180 bookings for its latest offering over the past one to one and a half months, over 20% of which have come from two of its Hyderabad dealerships.

“Hyderabad has been a very good market for us. What was surprising for us is we got more than 20% of our Vellfire customers from our dealerships here. That is the main reason we were pulled to Hyderabad to have our all-India launch,” said Naveen Soni, senior vice president, Toyota Kirloskar Motor told newspersons here on the sidelines of the new offering rollout.

He said after Hyderabad, the highest number of its customers for the new offering are from Delhi, followed by cities like Chennai and Ahmedabad.

Soni pointed out that the first three months of shipment for the Vellfire, which comes with a 2.5 litre gasoline hybrid engine coupled with dual motors, has already been sold out thanks to early technology adopter customers.

“The kind of response we have been getting with the Vellfire, its giving us a good indication that the customers are looking at advanced technologies such as self-charging hybrid electric vehicles. Hence we are confident that in the future there will be more such products coming as CBU (completely built units) from Japan for Indian customers,” he explained.

Talking about the BS IV inventory, he said the company has very few of the old models left and hopes to clear its entire stock of BS IV vehicles by the end of the month.

“Right from September to October and November we tried to reduce the BSIV inventory by trying to produce less BSIV vehicles and introducing more BSVI vehicles. We have cleared most of our BSIV stocks and there are few vehicles left which we are confident of clearing by the end of the month,” Soni said.

Greater Cochin Development Authority (Picture credit: Kerala police website)

KOCHI: Even while the Greater Cochin Development Authority (GCDA) is ready to present its budget for 2020-21 fiscal on Thursday, an analysis of GCDA activities in previous years shows that little has been done regarding the implementation of the projects proposed in the previous budget.

Major projects, including the Kochi Economic City and a tourism village in Palluruthy, which received prime focus in last budget, still remain on papers.

Other projects like an entertainment hub in Marine Drive and Mundamveli housing project for the rehabilitation of P&T Colony residents witnessed no major developments despite having received its focus in the budget.

GCDA chairman V Saleem refused to comment on the projects mentioned in the last budget and said all details about the status of the projects will be presented during the budget session.

The Kochi Economic City project aims at developing townships the suburbs—Aluva, Perumbavoor and Angamaly municipalities—which come under the limits of the development agencies. However, GCDA authorities had done little work so far though Rs 1 crore was allotted for conducting preliminary studies.

“There has not been any clear-cut idea on project’s benefits and how can it be implemented. Each township will consist of industrial units, healthcare institutions, educational institutions, tourism facilities, IT enterprises, sports facilities, service-oriented firms and residential areas etc. But no major development has been made,” said a senior GCDA official.

Setting up of a tourism village in Palluruthy is one of the fanciful projects designed by the GCDA and around 12.5 acres owned by GCDA in Palluruthy was announced to be used for the purpose. Rs 1 crore was allotted for the project but land allocation is yet to be completed. Shopping Complex at Manappattiparambu on PPP model, an open gym at Jawaharlal Nehru International Stadium are the other projects which remain as proposals.

Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal

NEW DELHI: Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Wednesday said “anti-social, political and external elements” indulged in violence in northeast Delhi, which left 27 dead and over 200 injured.

Speaking in Delhi assembly, Kejriwal said the aam aadmi didn’t want violence and Hindus and Muslims never wanted to fight. He said both Hindus and Muslims had suffered losses in the violence.

“The people of Delhi want to lead a life filled with peace, love and unity. All of this has not been done by the aam aadmi. This has been done by some anti-social, political and external elements,” the CM said, adding that people wanted to earn, provide a comfortable life to their families and create a bright future for their children.

Saying that the future of modern Delhi could not be built on a “pile of bodies”, Kejriwal emphasised, “It will be built on electricity, water and development. We should reject the politics of hate and riots. Delhi has to stand together and assert that politics which pitches brothers against each other will not be tolerated.”

After the assembly session, Kejriwal visited the riot-hit areas of Shiv Vihar and Karawal Nagar on Wednesday evening. He first visited the DCP (Northeast) office to take stock of the situation and then undertook confidence-building measures. He also announced compensation of Rs 1 crore to the family of head constable Ratan Lal who was killed in violence on Monday and also promised a government job to a family member.

Kejriwal said Lal was not killed while saving the life of a Hindu or a Muslim, but while saving his nation. The central government had also announced compensation of Rs 1 crore and a job to a member of Lal’s family.

Accepting that the situation was still very sensitive, Kejriwal said he had requested Union home minister Amit Shah on Wednesday morning to call the Army to control the situation.

Senior AAP functionaries said the CM had also written to Shah in this regard. “Through this House, I would like to appeal again to him that, if necessary, the Army should be called in to control the situation in the city. Curfew in the violence-affected areas should be imposed at the earliest to normalise the situation,” Kejriwal said.

The CM also urged people to “leave behind” the violence against each other. “All people should go back to their homes and try to live their lives peacefully and report all those elements who try to disturb their peace and unity,” he added.

Delhi was covered by media worldwide in the last three days for two reasons, the visit of the First Lady of the US, Melania Trump, to a Delhi government school to see the happiness curriculum and how the capital was burning when US President Donald Trump was in India, Kejriwal claimed.

“There was news of riots, hatred and divide in Delhi. Pictures of people’s houses, shops, entire markets in ruins were circulated by the international media. We have to decide on the pictures that we want to present to the world,” the CM said.

While appreciating Delhi Police for evacuating many families stuck in the violence and handling the situation despite “inadequate strength” and “lack of orders” from seniors, Kejriwal said there were some videos in which policemen were found helping the miscreants. “Many videos are going viral in which some policemen are seen helping the miscreants. If there are such people, they should be investigated,” Kejriwal said. He also appreciated the efforts of legislators and volunteers.

KOCHI: The state government has given administrative sanction for constructing an outer bund for Thanthonnithuruth , one of the islands off Marine Drive in the city. The Rs 6-crore project is expected to address waterlogging issues in the island.

As per estimate, the outer bund constructed around the residential area of the island can be also be used as a ring road. “Outer bund had been a long-standing demand by the islanders. Now, we have secured administrative sanction for the project. We have started efforts to secure technical sanction for it,” said T J Vinod, MLA.

According to the residents, they are living under constant threat of saline water intrusion. “Water would enter our houses during high tide. Earlier, this happened during November-December but it is quite frequent now. During the rain, which lashed the city on October 21, 2019, water gushed into more than 20 houses in the island,” said Ratnavalli, a nonagenarian resident. “Saline water would enter our premises most days. During rain, there would be knee-deep water inside our houses. Once the bund is constructed, we expect that it can bring a solution to the vexed issue,” she said.

Many of the houses in the island have been damaged due to intrusion of saline water. Some of the islanders have moved out while vast majority still live there as they have no place to go to. “During 2000-2005, land value in the area had touched Rs 15 lakh for a cent. Now, it has fallen to Rs 3 lakh or 4 lakh a cent, thanks to the stringent Coastal Regulation Zone (CRZ) rules. So, we are unable to even sell our land and move out,” said Dhanesh, a resident. As the raw materials are to be brought to the island using boats, the cost of constructing a house is very high. “Usha Raghunathan, who live alone in her dilapidated house, goes to her sister’s place in the night and returns in the morning,” said Preman P P, another resident.

Though the government had allotted funds for the work in 2014, the project failed to take off due to protests from a section of residents. “Funds were allotted for two projects — constructing outer bund and filling the residential area using red earth to raise its height,” said Subbayyan T R, a resident. “Irrigation department, which was to implement the projects, first started filling the residential area using red earth. But a section of the residents wanted that the work on the outer bund to be started first. The project was stalled due to the dispute,” he said.

Irrigation department officials were not available on phone to comment on the issue.

KOCHI: Thanthonnithuruth is just a stone’s throw away from Queen’s Walkway on Marine Drive. But the island with a population of around 230 still remains cut off from the mainland.

The islanders had been demanding that a bridge connecting their place and the mainland should be constructed across the backwaters. “During 2010, there was a move by the then district collector APM Mohammed Hanish to construct a bridge. But some people came up with allegations that the bridge is constructed for helping the landsharks who are not residents of the island. Then, the collector shelved the project,” Subbayyan T R, a resident , said. “It is a fact that some businessmen own land in the island. We want at least a small bridge through which an ambulance can be plied. Now, we have to depend on country boats to shift patients to hospital. We use boats for taking bodies to the crematorium,” he said.

The islanders depend on the ferry operated by the state water transport department (SWTD). “The boat service to the mainland will start from the island at 6.20am and the last trip from the mainland to the island is at 9.30pm. The boat would conduct trips at an interval of two hours,” said Boban T K, a resident. Last year, Sugunan, a fisherman, met with an accident while he was repairing fishing net. “I fell off into the backwaters and my jaw got broken. The SWTD boat was not available as it was night. Friends and relatives took me to a hospital in the mainland. On the way, our boat got stuck in a rope tied to a fishing net and we had a narrow escape,” said Sugunan, who was a member of the team which won first prize in the Indira Gandhi Memorial Boat Race organized by the tourism department in 1986.

Agra: In a joint operation by GRP and RPF, a 27-year-old woman was arrested from Delhi-bound Rajdhani Express for smuggling contraband to Aligarh. Her accomplice waiting at Agra Cantt station was arrested as well.

Identified as Suman Singh of Salempur village of Aligarh district, the accused was booked under Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act. Police also arrested one Praveen Kumar, a Sasani resident of Hathras district. The 41-year-old was waiting in a hatchback at the railway station for Suman.

On Wednesday, circle officer of GRP Agra division Anurag Singh said, “Our police team seized 20 kg of cannabis, whose value is worth Rs 1.60 lakh. The contraband was smuggled from Visakhapatnam.”

“In the past few years, we have made several arrests of men and women who were acting as courier of drug cartels based in Delhi and Aligarh. Their modus operandi is simple. They book tickets of premium trains and travel like normal passengers to smuggle drugs. Till date, we haven’t found the source and the last man in the string of drug racket. None of the apprehended accused really knows, as who is the kingpin of the drug cartel,” he said.

Since 2015, nearly Rs 5 crore worth of cannabis has been seized from Agra Cantt railway station from scores of couriers said to be travelling from Visakhapatnam.

Representative image

NAGPUR: Expressing concern over a woman’s death due to pothole, the Nagpur bench of Bombay High Court on Wednesday directed the respondents to probe role of contractor and civic officials concerned into the accident.

The directives came from a division bench comprising justices Sunil Shukre and Madhav Jamdar while hearing a plea based on TOI report exposing dreadful condition of city roads that has led to several accidents and loss of lives till January 15. The bench also asked the registry to convert the suo motu writ petition (No. 838/2019) into a criminal PIL so that its scope could be expanded.

Amicus curiae Raheel Mirza submitted TOI report of February 12 to the bench regarding death of Indukala Chauhan (55) who sustained serious head injuries after her son’s bike abruptly slipped due to a pothole near Hazaripahad Square. The Gittikhadan cops filed accidental death and didn’t register any offence, in spite of HC’s directives.

In October last year, a division bench comprising justices Zaka Haq and Pushpa Ganediwala had directed the respondents — municipal commissioner and city police chief — to take action against civic and police officials concerned for any accidents due to potholes leading to loss of lives or injuries to citizens.

The amicus also submitted Visvesvaraya National Institute of Technology (VNIT) report on how small potholes have expanded into big craters in absence of repairs. The report was published by TOI on February 16 that exposed how ignorance of Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) has led to manifold rise in expenditure towards repairs of potholes.

Earlier, former DCP (Traffic) Chinmay Pandit filed an affidavit stating that there are 10 traffic zones under the commissionerate of Nagpur city police. “As directed by HC, the main road coming under the respective traffic zones are inspected through in charge senior police inspector, where it was noticed that at 121 places either there are potholes or the roads are in bad condition.

He admitted that water gets accumulated at Narendra Nagar railway under bridge due to absence of proper drainage system, thus obstructing smooth flow of traffic.

Pandit informed that the e-mail id dcptrafficnagpur2gmail.com, WhatsApp number — 9011387100 and twitter handle @trafficngp are provided by the police department for lodging complaints in respect of potholes. “From October 16-18, 2019, a total of 282 complaints were received. From October 29 to November 12, 62 complaints were received,” he said.

Eleven cities from Kerala have been included in the national clean air programme (NCAP). They are Kochi , Thiruvananthapuram, Kozhikode, Kottayam, Palakkad, Alappuzha, Pathanamthitta, Kollam, Sultan Bathery, Kakkanchery and Thrissur.

Track the pollution level in your city

Of the total 25 monitoring stations from which data will be published, Kochi has the maximum number of monitoring stations (seven) followed by Thiruvananthapuram (four). Rest will have one or two stations. NCAP hopes that an action plan would be conceived to reduce particulate pollution by 20-30% by 2024 from the levels in 2017.

“Though central pollution control board announced NCAP, there is still ambiguity over how they would take the data into account. For example, though the rules clearly state that pollution should be monitored for 18 hours, in Kozhikode, the data was based on just 10 hours,” said Centre for Science and Environment’s executive director Anumita Roy Chowdhury.

She said the question remains whether we have an explicit official method to report long-term trend in air quality and report compliance against targets and a national ambient air quality standard. The programme aims to identify emission sources, assessment of contribution of these sources, prioritizing the sources that need to be tackled and thus maintain the air quality.

Family of Rahul outside GTB Hospital on Wednesday

NEW DELHI: On the fifth day of the mayhem in northeast Delhi, the death toll has risen to 32 on Thursday. One of those who had died was a mentally unstable man who was standing outside his house to help people. He collapsed after getting shot. By the time he was taken to a hospital, he had died.

The family of 22-year-old Mehtab had planned to get him treated at a bigger hospital in March. However, the plans ended shortly after his death. Yasmin, his sister-in-law, had a hard time holding back her tears as she waited for his body. She broke down after seeing another victim’s body being handed over to his family.

“What is this community divide that has been created and is taking the lives of innocent people? Mehtab’s best friend was a Hindu. Despite his mental instability, he was always very sensitive towards other people. He had stepped out of the house after hearing the gunshots just to ensure that everyone around was safe. Within five minutes, he was shot dead. A few people locked our house from the outside and we had a hard time getting Mehtab inside, but it was too late by then,” Yasmin said.

Like him, 32-year-old Alok Tiwari, a resident of Shiv Vihar, had ventured out to “protect his neighbourhood” from outsiders. However, he was caught in the crossfire.

A relative said they are yet to know the exact cause of his death. “It could have been a gunshot or stones. He was bleeding profusely from the head where he was hit. He was rushed to GTB Hospital, but he could not make it. The entire family is still in shock,” the relative added. Tiwari was married and had two children.

Another victim, Rahul Thakur (23), was shot dead when he stepped out to buy milk. “He feared we would run out of groceries and milk. He was shot in the chest and was found bleeding profusely,” said a relative.

At the emergency wards of hospitals, over 200 injured were ferried in the last 24 hours, several of them in a critical condition. Most had bullet wounds or were beaten with sticks. One of the critically injured was 22-year-old Shahrukh. He was beaten with rods and stripped naked. He was then paraded on the road. He is in the ICU at GTB Hospital and remains critical, said his father Yakub Ali.

At Jag Pravesh Hospital, Behrav, a resident of Brijpuri, was rushed in on Wednesday evening. He had been attacked by a mob in the interior lanes of the locality. Bleeding profusely, he is said to be serious by the doctors. His relatives said he had gone out to fetch grocery. He was cornered by a group, forced to remove his pants to prove his religion, thrashed and thrown into a drain.

Abdul Samad (21), who had gone to pray at the local masjid in Mustafabad, suffered a similar fate. Rioters barged inside and started beating people. Samad was hit by sticks and stones, which left him bleeding under his left eye. He was rushed to Al-Hind Hospital on Tuesday night and then taken to GTB Hospital on Wednesday morning. “I was provided basic treatment at Al-Hind. We waited the entire night as we could not leave the hospital,” said Samad.

Guntur: Fresh trouble is brewing at Acharya Nagarjuna University ( ANU ) as YSRC legislators are planning to move a privilege motion against Dr P Rajasekhar, vice-chancellor, in-charge.

The legislators allege the VC is taking unilateral decisions. They said they have not been invited to the convocation to be held on Thursday. They were upset after finding an invitation card without the names of the district legislators. “The invitation doesn’t have my name as local legislator. It is a breach of protocol and I will raise the issue in assembly,” Ponnur MLA Kilari Rosaiah said.

He said he would had move a privilege motion as the VC is taking controversial decisions to humiliate public representatives.

Sources said Mangalagiri legislator Alla Ramakrishna Reddy, too, has expressed displeasure about the VC’s attitude in handling important decisions. Sources said several YSRC legislators are upset for the VC giving only one honorary doctorate during the convocation.

ANU has decided to confer honorary doctorate to ABK Prasad, veteran journalist and a critic of TDP president Chandrababu Naidu.

“ANU covers Guntur and Prakasam districts and we should have honoured eminent people from these districts and also from other parts of the country. We should utilize such occasion to recognize the services of prominent people and industrialists to seek their support for development,” said a legislator. He said a discussion with public representatives would have helped the VC take a better decision.

The in-charge VC Rajasekhar said they have a procedure to conduct the convocation and there was no rule to print legislators’ names on invitation cards. He, however, said the varsity has sent formal invitations to all the legislators in the district.

“As per the procedure, only names of the chancellor (governor), chief guest and higher education minister would be printed on the invite. We have not breached any rule,” Rajasekhar said.

He said they have followed instructions of previous governor ESL Narasimhan who directed the universities not to confer more than one honorary doctorate during convocations. “It is true that we could honour more people with doctorates. We will take a call on the issue after taking the present governor’s advice and implement from the next convocation,” said Rajasekhar.

Dehradun: Devotees from across the globe who are unable to visit Uttarakhand for the Char Dham Yatra will now be able to pay their obeisance at the four Himalayan shrines through an online medium.

According to government sources, Jio, a telecommunication company, has been tasked with facilitating a ‘digital darshan’ of the Char Dham shrines.

Every year, lakhs of pilgrims visit Uttarakhand for the Char Dham Yatra but many more skip the pilgrimage due to a variety of reasons. Such people would now be able to use the digital facility to offer prayers from any part of the world.

Sources said that the proposed platform would also provide ‘online darshan’ of other famous temples situated across Uttarakhand.

CM Rawat said, “Through digital darshan of Char Dham and other temples, people from across the world will learn more about spirituality in Uttarakhand. The online medium will be especially beneficial for those devotees who are not physically fit to undertake the Char Dham Yatra.” He added that record number of pilgrims went on Char Dham Yatra last year and the numbers are likely to go up further once the Rishikesh-Karnaprayag railway project and all-weather road project are completed.

During the 2018 Investors’ Summit, businessman Mukesh Ambani had met chief minister Trivendra Singh Rawat in Mumbai and discussed plans to join hands to strengthen the internet connectivity in the hill state.

Nainital: The Uttarakhand high court on Wednesday directed the chief secretary of the state to provide a detailed list of religious structures encroaching public land in all the 13 districts and explain what steps have been taken against them.

Hearing a PIL on religious structures encroaching streets, public parks and other public land, a bench of Chief Justice Ramesh Ranganathan and Justice Ramesh Chandra Khulbe said that the chief secretary should furnish the details of such encroachments where no action has been taken. A lawyer said, “The court also said that if the officer fails to provide these details, he should be personally present in the court on March 4 when the case will be heard next.”

The directive comes just days after another division bench of Justice NS Dhanik and Justice Sudhanshu Dhulia, while hearing the same matter on February 10, had held that the chief secretary’s earlier reply was “evasive”. The bench had said that though the affidavit mentioned the number of such unauthorised constructions and action taken against some of them, it does not provide any information on what happened to the other structures.

The abundance of illegal religious structures across Uttarakhand has been a serious and persistent public issue. In fact, Uttarakhand was the only state to not file an affidavit in the Supreme Court despite its clear directions in January 2018 that directed the chief secretaries to frame policies in consultation with the government “in respect of existing unauthorised construction of a religious nature which had already taken place; and to review the same on a case to case basis”

Sanganer MLA Ashok Lahoty, along with BJP supporters, staged a protest at JDA for granting another land for Haj House in the city. Lahoty claimed that as per the rules, only one Haj House can be built in the state, then why have two places been allotted.“When there is already a land allotted to them in the city in Ramganj, then why another land has been provided. It is just to favour one particular community. At Ramganj, there is a presence of their community, then why land has been given to them in Sanganer? They do not have any members in the area. Already two times, curfew was imposed in Sanganer due to tussle, not any more,” said Lahoty.A court case decided the fate of the land recently. The party in support of the land said that apart from the Haj House, a land to build a rest house for the travellers in the city is also required. The protesters alleged that the government, pressured by one community, and for vote banks, did not go for appeal. “Government must appeal for the matter in a higher court. They did not present valid arguments in the case on proper grounds due to which the government lost.

191,['27/02/2020'],Goa: Turbid water trickles from taps in Keri,"This story is from February 27, 2020

Villagers have been receiving turbid water (R) since the past 10 days

By: Afaq Khan

VALPOI: With water levels in the Anjunem dam dipping, the villagers of Keri, Sattari , have been grappling with a severe water shortage for the past 10 days. And when they do get supply from the Keri water treatment plant (WTP), the water is turbid and yellow— unfit to drink, they say.

Assistant engineer for PWD’s water supply division, Valpoi, Prashant Gaude told TOI that the water resources department(WRD) had recently opened the lower gate of the Anjunem dam, resulting in the supply of yellowish water with high iron content. “Usually the WRD officials open the upper gates of the dam, but since there was not enough water at the upper level, they were forced to open the lower gate,” Gaude said.

Gaude further said that a large team of PWD officials had been deployed at the site and were working hard to resolve the issue. “We are taking every precaution to subject the water to more intensive treatments to make it safe to use, we are testing water samples on a daily basis,” he said.

When health minister Vishwajit Rane was informed of the issue, he called a meeting of the PWD and WRD officials on Monday and instructed them to take more precautions while supplying water to the villagers. However, supply is still poor as the Keri WTP has the capacity to treat only 8 MLD of water per day, which is less than half of the daily water consumption of the area.

Speaking to TOI, the sarpanch of Keri village panchayat, Govind Gawas, said that panic gripped Keri village when the yellowish water trickled from their taps, after several days of poor supply. “A few parts of Keri, like Ghoteli, Kewada, Dhangar wada and Shiroli, are located at a height, and the water cannot reach these areas due to low pressure, so tankers have been arranged,” Gawas said, adding that water was now being treated to remove the iron contamination.

Lab technician Dharma Shetyekar said that officials are allowed to release water with iron content less than 0.3 mg/l, which is the permissible limit. “In Keri, we have measured iron content of 1.37 mg per litre of water, which is too high,” Shetyakar said. The villagers may have to cope with water shortage for a few more days as it is taking longer than usual to treat the water, and as a result, only 8MLD of water is released, he said.

Keri-Sattari resident Devendra Gawas said that 90% of the houses at Keri are still facing the water shortage. Some houses get low pressure supply, but only for few hours— not even long enough for their tanks to fill, he complained. ""Officials say that they provide tankers to the houses where there is water scarcity, but there are many homes in Keri where the tankers cannot reach due to the terrain of the areas, or lack of roads for the tankers to navigate. How will these people get water?” he asked.

AHMEDABAD: Gujarat does not have enviable statistics of malnutrition, especially among children. A recent Comprehensive Nutrition Survey (2016-18) of the government of India stated that 39 per cent of children in Gujarat below the age of four are stunted.

Introduction of Tur Dal in the PDS is an important step in ensuring people get a protein rich diet. I hope they start introducing protein-rich diet in anganwadis of the state as well,” said Neeta Hardikar, director, Anna Suraksha Adhikar Abhiyan. She added that the Gujarat government should follow states like Madhya Pradesh and Chhatisgarh and introduce eggs in mid-day meal scheme.State finance minister Nitin Patel announced in the budget that under the new scheme, 12 kg Tur Dal will be distributed to each beneficiary at concessional rates from PDS outlets. There are 66 lakh beneficiaries under the PDS in the state. The state has made a provision of Rs 287 for this addition to list of groceries under the PDS.The government announced a number of new schemes in 2020 state budget to address burning issues. A scheme called the `Madre Vatan Yojana’ was also announced during the budget. Under the scheme, the state government will contribute an equal amount of donation that an individual gives to develop facilities like school, kindergarten, dispensary or other public amenities in villages. A provision of Rs 200 crore has been made under the scheme.In its bid to curb pollution and make state plastic free, the state government has announced a scheme to purchase plastic and dry waste from rag pickers in cities. A provision of Rs 56 crore has been made for this scheme, finance minister Patel said.The state government has also extended the `Smart Cities’ scheme to towns.

TOI accessed at least six FIRs, the most prominent ones being reported from Girish Park, Netaji Nagar, Patuli, Salt Lake and Garfa.

Panicking, she responded to the message, and following “instructions” given out, she downloaded a an app, TeamViewer QuickSupport, on her mobile and shared an OTP. The app allowed the accused to gain control over her mobile. Shortly, she received five messages from her bank, alerting her that Rs 90,299 had been debited from her account in five transactions.

Salem: Social activist Piyush Manush,40, was arrested on Wednesday for allegedly attacking his house owner, a widow, when she asked him to vacate the rental house.

In her complaint, 53-year-old Asha Kumari, of Kondappanaickenpatty area at the foothills of Yercaud, said she had rented out her house to Piyush Manush in 2015.

Pointing out that she had been residing in Bengaluru with her husband S N Singh, Kumari said she had decided to shift to her own house in Kondappanaickenpatty area after the demise of her husband in April 2017. “I requested Piyush to vacate the house, but he refused. I subsequently didn’t renew the rental agreement in 2018. After that too, he not only refused to vacate the house but also stopped paying me the rent.”

On Monday, Asha Kumari had approached the activist with a request to vacate the house. This time, Piyush allegedly assaulted her, and she lodged a complaint with city police commissioner T Senthil Kumar. The case was transferred to the Kannankurichi police.

She had also met chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswami in Salem the same day and petitioned him to take action against her tenant.

On Wednesday, police inspector V Thangavel held an inquiry with Piyush Manush for nearly three hours. “We subsequently registered four cases against him under Sections 354 (assault or criminal force to woman with intent to outrage her modesty), 294 (b) (sings, recites or utters any obscene song, ballad or words, in or near any public place), 323 (punishment for voluntarily causing hurt) and 506 (1) (criminal intimidation) of the Indian Penal Code and arrested him,” the officer said.

The activist was produced before the judicial magistrate of Salem district court and lodged in the Vellore Central Prison under judicial custody in the evening.

Talking to reporters, Piyush’s wife Monika said they had spent Rs 4 lakh to renovate the house before they moved into it in 2015. “Moreover, our children are studying in a nearby school and we can’t vacate the house until their exams are over.” She said there was political pressure on police to arrest her husband as he had opposed central and state government projects that were against farmers and public.

Vadodara: “Number of girl students caught adopting unfair means while appearing in the exams have gone up,” said Prof M N Parmar, convenor of MSU’s unfair means committee, which disclosed a report on “copy cats” found during the first half exams conducted at the university campus.

The report alarmingly revealed that as many as 67 girl students were caught adopting unfair means during the examination, while only 59 boys were found cheating.

However, Parmar further said that exam reforms introduced by the university along with awareness programmes have resulted in lesser number of copycats.

“Overall the number of such cases have reduced significantly. Earlier, we would find more than 200 cases, which came down to 170 last time and this time we have 130 such cases,” he said.

Explaining why cases of cheating have gone down over time, Parmar said that many students now know that if they fail in a particular subject in the month of June, they can appear again in the month of October. “This is much better instead of wasting an entire term if they are caught cheating,” he added.

While most of them were found to be using traditional methods of using chits, writing answers on clip boards and body parts, some were novel methods were revelations even for the hawk-eyed faculty.

Addressing a press meet, the minister said Andhra Pradesh School Education Department and Board of Intermediate Education would use advanced technology to conduct the examinations in a fair and transparent way.

Suresh said the government was focused on bringing in reforms to create a stress-free environment for students . “We have made elaborate arrangements for the public examinations this year.

“Co-ordination committees with officials of education, revenue, electricity and APSRTC have been formed to provide amenities for students at examination centers. District collectors are playing a key role in coordination works. Safe drinking water, electricity, city bus facility will be provided at all examination centers across the state,” said the minister.

“We have directed authorities to arrange benches and furniture to students so that no one sits on the floor to write exams. We are verifying possibilities of utilising the services of village volunteers as invigilators for intermediate exams,” he said.

“There is no internal assessment and bit paper for SSC students from this academic year. We have directed the officials to conduct awareness programmes for students about the revised pattern.

Curtorim MLA Aleixo Reginaldo Lourenco

MARGAO: Curtorim MLA Aleixo Reginaldo Lourenco has expressed his disapproval over the permission granted by the state government for the ninth onshore casino to be opened at a starred hotel on Kadamba plateau.

Accusing the government of having become “submissive to casinos”, Lourenco said it would never act against them “as it is solely dependent on this gambling industry to finance its BJP party, both locally and nationally”.

“How desperate the BJP state government is towards casino money can be gauged by the fact that the nod for the ninth casino was given just before the code of conduct was enforced for the zilla panchayat elections,” Lourenco said in a press note.

He further pointed out that since March 2012, when BJP assumed power in Goa, it kept giving false promises on establishing a gaming commission, shifting offshore casinos out of the Mandovi river and banning entry to Goans.

“The state government should take a leaf from the neighbouring Karnataka, which has ruled casinos out. Very recently, Karnataka tourism minister C T Ravi said there were no plans to open casinos to boost tourism in the state,” Lourenco added. He further urged the government to try and open environmentally friendly industries.

MUMBAI: Homeopathy doctors are furious over a question in the Indian National Junior Science Olympiad test terming the stream of medicine as “pseudoscience”. They have demanded disciplinary action against concerned people and an apology.

The INJSO 2020 test conducted by the Homi Bhabha Centre for Science Education (HBCSE) took place earlier this month. Question 31 carrying seven marks was found to be objectionable by doctors who said it “mocked” homeopathy as a pseudoscience . Indian National Junior Science Olympiad (INJSO) is a competitive exam open to secondary school students. “I got a rude shock when I came to know that the INJSO–2020 exam Question 31 makes a mockery of homoeopathy,” said Dr Praful Barvalia.

When TOI contacted Aniket Sule, a reader at HBCSE, he said the question was printed after “proper consideration... There are hardly any countries in the world that consider homeopathy as a medical science. Our question is about calculating scientifically if there is any meaning in the claims made by homeopathy.”

Homeopaths say the stream has lakhs of subscribers in India and is recognized by AYUSH, a part of the ministry of health.

Sule said, “There are government programmes which fund research to find the medicinal effect of cow urine. That does not mean medicinal effect of cow urine is a factual science. Or, say, there are universities which have graduation programmes in astrology. That does not mean it is meaningful science.”

A doctor said, “INJSO comes under the government of India. AYUSH is also a part of the government. Homoeopathy is an integral part of AYUSH. How can one part of the government do this?”

PANAJI/SALIGAO: Citizens queuing up at the regional transport office (RTO) in Mapusa on Tuesday and Wednesday were in for a rude shock to learn systems were paralysed, and the internet connectivity could not be restored. All operations pertaining to licensing, registration of vehicles and that of high security registration plates (HSRP) were suspended on both days.

A notice has been placed outside the office stating that there is a network connectivity issue since Tuesday and the “inconvenience caused is highly regretted”. Internet connectivity comes under the purview of the Goa Broadband Network (GBBN). Sources from GBBN said that there was a fibre cut in the town’s aerial cabling which occurred during Tuesday’s carnival float parade.

Other government offices in Mapusa like the PWD, police station, electricity department were also affected due to the cut cable, sources said.

A majority of the transport transactions are now online, owing to which various tasks could not be completed by RTO staff. Sources said citizens waiting in line to complete their works had to be sent back on Tuesday. The situation prevailed through a major part of Wednesday as well. “The RTO in Mapusa has been vacant since Tuesday as the systems are not working due to the cable cut. I had been there on both days, but the problem was not resolved,” a Mapusa resident told TOI.

RTO officials said that a lot of licensing and registration work is pending due to this. Assistant director of transport Madan S Fatarpekar told TOI that the entire office is facing problems due to the connectivity issue. “We have informed the internet service provider about the bad connectivity and we expect the problem to be resolved as soon as possible,” he said. The HSRP operations counter at the RTO’s officer was also affected. “The connection was restored later in the day. But by that time, most citizens had stopped coming in,” an RTO official said.

GBBN confirmed that the lines were restored by Wednesday afternoon.

The Andhra Pradesh government, which is gearing up to give house sites for around 25 lakh poor by Ugadi on March 25, is undertaking a huge exercise in identifying land. Around 1,500 acres of land is required to allocate house sites for the poor residing in Vijayawada, Tadepalli, Mangalagiri, and Duggirala.

The state government had decided to give land to around 54,307 beneficiaries.

Amaravati farmers challenged the GO in the high court. The counsel representing the capital farmers requested the Andhra Pradesh high court, on Wednesday, to cancel the GO as capital lands were meant for development activities. They argued that the government is trying to create slums in Amaravati. The court posted the case to Thursday for further hearing.

Jana Sena chief Pawan Kalyan said that the government is deliberately trying to create a rift among the people. “The government issued orders allocating the lands acquired for the capital city for the purpose of house sites for the poor as it will lead to disputes. No one will find fault in allocating house sites to the poor people. If the government has real commitment, it should give dispute free lands. The poor people will suffer with further legal complications,” Pawan said.

Jaipur: Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot on Wednesday justified Congress president Sonia Gandhi’s demand for the resignation of Union home minister Amit Shah , saying he had failed to curb the violence in Delhi.

Gehlot said, Shah should resign on moral grounds as he did “nothing to save lives and restore normalcy” in the national capital.

Earlier in the day, the Congress chief alleged that there was a “well-planned” conspiracy behind the violence, that also led to injuries to more than 200 people over the past three days.

The Centre, the home minister and the Delhi government are responsible for the situation in the national capital, Sonia Gandhi alleged.

Supporting her demand for Shah’s resignation, Gehlot tweeted, “Congress president Sonia Gandhi has rightly demanded that the Home Minister should resign, given his ‘inaction’ during incidents of violence and arson in Delhi and his inability to control the situation. Delhi has been burning and we see no action from Home Minister.”

The chief minister added, “What we are witnessing in Delhi is a result of inflammatory speeches and provocative statements given by BJP leaders. They have purposely created a vicious environment of hatred and fear. Worst is the authorities remained a mute spectator and did nothing to control the situation.”

Accused Amarendra Pattanaik

BENGALURU: The case of a miscreant opening fire at a 25-year-old woman in Whitefield on Tuesday evening has taken an interesting turn. The man, who is suspected to be the woman’s jilted lover, was found lying unconscious near Marathahalli bridge in the early hours of Wednesday.

Amarendra Pattanaik, a native of Odisha, works as a software engineer with a firm in Hyderabad. Police identified him on the basis of a 17-page handwritten note in English with him. While the woman, Subhashree Priyadarshini, is out of danger now, Pattanaik is battling for life.

On Tuesday evening, Pattanaik opened fire on Priyadarshini outside her paying guest accommodation in Manjunath Layout, Munnekolala. Another PG occupant had rushed her to a hospital. Police had recovered a country-made pistol and a mobile phone from the spot.

Priyadarshini and Pattanaik worked for a software firm in Hyderabad. In 2018, Priyadarshini moved to Bengaluru and joined Nimhans as a software developer. According to her colleagues, Pattanaik would come to Bengaluru to meet her.

Around 2.30am on Wednesday, passersby saw Pattanaik lying unconscious near Marathahalli bridge and alerted police.

“Initially, we thought it was an accident. After reading the 17-page note, we realised he was the man who shot Priyadarshini. He had slit his throat and wrist. After he fell on the road, a vehicle knocked him down,” an investigating officer said.

Another officer said the last page of the note explained how movable properties of Pattanaik should be dispersed after his death. “The other pages talk about his relationship with Priyadarshini and how frustrated he was after she moved to Bengaluru. But we need to confirm his claims,” he added.

Disowned by family?

Police said Pattanaik’s family has so far refused to come down from Odisha to attend to him. “Both his younger brother and father said they had severed ties with him,” an officer said.

Doval assured people of adequate security and told the media that police is on the ground and doing its job

NEW DELHI: Residents of riot-hit northeast Delhi had an unexpected visitor late on Tuesday night and Wednesday afternoon with National Security Advisor Ajit Doval knocking on the doors for real and speaking to them as he walked around extensively, meeting and assuring people to not worry or feel scared.

“Ab sab theek hai.. koi darne ki baat nahi hai.. We are here as per orders of HM and PM... Inshallah yahan par bilkul aman hoga...,” he said. Doval visited several areas like Brahmpuri, Ghonda, Jafrabad, Maujpur, Seelampur, Gamdi and Chauhan Bangar and met people at their doorsteps and intersections.

Doval had reached the office of DCP (north-east) in Seelampur around 11.45pm on Tuesday and chalked out a plan of action with special CP S N Shrivastava and other senior officers before venturing out on the streets. He returned at 4pm on Wednesday and visited different areas in North-East Delhi after reviewing the situation.

In Brahampuri, he walked a couple of kilometres, meeting people and asking how they were. Many residents got emotional while recalling the riots. At one point, a woman came up to him and said how she almost had a ‘heart attack’ seeing the rioters go on rampage but was feeling assured after seeing him there. Doval wittily replied: “No no.. keep your heart strong.. don’t feel weak so easily.. all is good now.. just stay united.”

At another place, he addressed a group of men at an intersection saying: “Prem ki bhaavna bana kar rakhiye. Hamara ek desh hai, hum sab ko milkar rehna hai. Desh ko mil kar aage badhana hai.”

“People have a sense of unity among them, there is no enmity. A few criminals do things like this (spread violence), people are trying to isolate them. Police is here & doing its work...,” he said while holding residents by the arm and patting their back. Later, he told reporters, “Situation is totally under control. People are satisfied. I have confidence in law enforcement agencies. Police is doing its work... My message is that those who love their country.. also love their society, their neighbour. Everyone should live with love and harmony with others. People should try to resolve each other's problems and not increase them.”

The NSA’s intervention came soon after US President Donald Trump’s state visit ended and followed heightened deployment of police forces on Tuesday night which seemed to have resulted in a reduction in violence.

In his interactions, Doval assured people of adequate security and told the media that police is on the ground and doing its job.

Earlier, Doval, who has been tasked with checking violence, held a meeting with the Delhi Police brass at the office of the deputy commissioner of police (Northeast) in Seelampur. Newly-appointed special CP S N Shrivastava, additional commissioner of police (Crime) Mandeep Singh Randhawa, Special CP (Law and Order) Satisha Golcha and DCP northeast Ved Prakash Arya were among those present.

Sawant added that he saw no reason to provide a white paper on the Mhadei dispute as demanded by the opposition.

“Unanimously, the opposition should have supported the government because this is an issue of the state, not of Pramod Sawant. It was vital for them to support the government but instead they are indulging in politics,” he told reporters on the sidelines of a function in Panaji.

Sawant said the state had roped in senior Supreme Court lawyer Mukul Rohatgi to argue on Goa’s behalf and to seek a stay on the notification of the Mahdei Water Disputes Tribunal award. “The way we have prepared a strong case in Supreme Court and prepared evidence, we will win the case,” said Sawant.

KOLKATA: A 21-year-old college student travelling on a bus stood up to her molester , dialled 100 and got him arrested.

The incident took place at Jodhpur Park on Tuesday evening, when the young woman from Darjeeling was returning from a nearby popular mall to her Kolkata accommodation at Taltala. The accused has been identified as Rohan Kumar Jaiswal (30), a resident of Howrah.

“The woman boarded a bus on Route 240. Soon after she got a seat, the accused sat next to her. He began touching her inappropriately. She protested and even drew the attention of the conductor but still, the accused continued to harass her. It was then that she placed a call to the Lalbazar Control Room by dialling 100. As the bus headed for Dhakuria, the control room relayed the complaint to Jadavpur police station , Lake police station and the Jadavpur traffic guard. Cops from the Lake police station responded, stopped the bus and caught the accused from the spot,” said an officer.

A case pertaining to molestation and outraging the modesty of a woman has been registered at the Lake police station. Cops said that after the accused was hauled away, the victim was safely dropped off to her residence. “We will record the woman’s statement before a magistrate and might ask for a test identification parade. A charge sheet will follow shortly. We will record the statements of the conductor and some passengers,” said a senior officer.

Police pointed out this was a perfect example of how to react to such situations. “We are always ready to listen and respond to any distress call,” said a Lalbazar officer. Cops said there had been multiple arrests following calls to Dial 100 ever since model Ushoshi Sengupta was chased by helmetless bikers and the brass introduced a new SOP that spoke of coordination between the central control room and the various police stations.

(The victim's identity has not been revealed to protect her privacy as per Supreme Court directives on cases related to sexual assault)

219,['27/02/2020'],Campus strikes: HC orders strict police action,"This story is from February 27, 2020

Kochi: Reiterating that student organizations do not have the right to compel students to participate in strikes nor do they have the right to conduct strikes on school or college campuses , the high court on Wednesday ordered heads of all educational institutions to promptly report such disturbances to police and asked the state police chief to direct police officers to take prompt action.

Justice PB Suresh Kumar issued the order after considering a total of 26 petitions filed by schools and colleges, with the lead case being a plea by Raju Kuruvilla, manager of MS Higher Secondary School at Ranni in Pathanamthitta, through advocate Jacob P Alex.

In the judgment, the court referred to a 2017 decision (Antony Thomas vs Muhammed Rafique) in which it was held that it is the obligation of police to ensure that academic atmosphere in educational institutions are not disturbed and that educational institutions cannot be hijacked or converted into a political battle field. The court also cited a 2003 decision (Vijayakumar V vs State of Kerala), which held that police can enter campuses to prevent or take action against students engaging in criminal activities.

The court, in its judgment, said: “…organizations of students do not have the right to disrupt or disturb the academic and other activities of students who do not want to partake in their strikes and agitations, or any right to compel such students to forego the aforesaid activities in their campuses. Similarly, it is also declared that organizations of students do not have any right to convene any meetings and resort to the modes of agitations like strike, dharna, gherao, processions, etc in the school or college campuses… It is also declared that it is the obligation of the police to ensure that the fundamental rights of the students to pursue their academics in the campuses are not thwarted by anyone...”

However, the judgment does not mean that students cannot voice their opinions on political issues and redress their grievances by recourse to various forums allowed by statutes and executive orders.

Further, the court said educational institutions are forced to approach the high court for police protection despite several judicial pronouncements regarding the rights of students. The position of government and quasi-government institutions is that students have to forego studies until disturbances and disruptions settle down naturally, the court said. It is the students themselves who become victims of student unrest in campuses, the court pointed out.

Noticing that judicial pronouncements alone won’t suffice, the court ordered, “…I deem it appropriate to direct the director of collegiate education, director of higher secondary education, director of public instruction and also the registrars of the various universities in the state to bring this judgment to the notice of the heads of the educational institutions under them, and direct them to bring the external and internal disturbances affecting the conduct of the classes forthwith to the notice of the police...

220,['27/02/2020'],MP contractor cheated of Rs 25 lakh in city,"This story is from February 27, 2020

Vadodara: A civil contractor from Dhar district in Madhya Pradesh was duped of Rs 25 lakh by an alleged iron trader living at Sama and his three aides on Tuesday.

Civil contractor Aslam Multani had come to buy iron rods for his construction project as these cost less in Vadodara than in Madhya Pradesh.

In his complaint lodged at Sama police station, Multani stated that a real estate broker from Indore – Yogesh Agrawal – knew accused iron trader, Rahul Patel. Agrawal told Multani that he can help him get the iron rod at Rs 35 per kg instead of the prevailing price of Rs 44 in Madhya Pradesh. After Multani and his partner managed to arrange Rs 35 lakh, Multani, his friend Rashid Khan and Agrawal came to Vadodara on Tuesday.

On reaching Golden Chowkdi on national highway-48, Patel asked them to wait as he had sent his men to receive them. An hour later three persons reached in an SUV and asked Multani and Agrawal to sit in their car so that they can take them to Patel’s home in Sama. Khan, meanwhile, waited at Golden Chowkdi. When Multani and Agrawal got down on reaching Sama, the three others fled away in their car. Agrawal called up Patel, who asked them to reach Halol.

The duo was picked up from Sama by Khan and drove to Halol. When they reached Halol, Patel asked them to Kalol and later asked to come to Godhra. On reaching Godhra, when Multani called Patel, the latter asked them to come to Dahod. It was then that Multani realized that Patel was only fooling him and he had lost his money.

The trio came back to Vadodara to inform police. Multani registered a complaint of cheating against Patel and his three unidentified men at Sama police station. “We are trying to track down the accused based on the phone number given by the complainant,” said a police official.

Times News Network

Jaipur: Chief minister Ashok Gehlot accused US President Donald Trump of hurting the country's reputation by not mentioning Mahatma Gandhi in the visitor’s book at Sabarmati Ashram.

Gehlot said a person who does not have any regard for Mahatma Gandhi and whose ideology does not match with that of Gandhi was taken to Sabarmati Ashram in Ahmedabad.

“Mahatma Gandhi's name was not mentioned in the comments; Narendra Modi's name was written. I think that it has hurt the reputation of the country,” the chief minister told reporters here on Wednesday.

Trump visited Sabarmati Ashram on Monday. In his message in the visitor’s book, he wrote: “To my great friend Prime Minister Modi - Thank you for this wonderful visit.”

The next day, during his visit to the Rajghat in Delhi, the US president paid homage to Mahatma Gandhi. “The American people stand strongly with a sovereign and wonderful India -The vision of the great Mahatma — This is a tremendous honour!"" Trump wrote in the visitors’ book at Rajghat.

Expressing concern over the violence in Delhi, Gehlot said it was the result of polarisation which was done during the Delhi Assembly elections.

“A campaign was run in Delhi elections for polarisation. They could not succeed that time because the public taught them a lesson, but it is the result of the campaign which the entire world is seeing now,” he said, targeting the BJP.

Gehlot said that US president’s programme remained intact despite the dharnas and demonstrations being held across the country and in the national capital.

A scene from Suveeran’s play, based on Paul Zacharia’s novella

THRISSUR: Onstage nudity is still too hot to handle. The National School of Drama (NSD) has now asked director Suveeran , to clarify the portrayal of nudity in his play.

NSD asked for clarification on the play, ‘Bhaskara Pattelarum Thommiyude Jeevithavum’, staged in Puducherry on February 12, 2020.

The play, based on Paul Zacharia ’s novella, ‘ Bhaskara Pattelarum Ente Jeevithavum ’, had received wide acclaim at the recently-concluded International Theatre Festival of Kerala .

NSD had given a contract to Suveeran to stage the play at the Bharat Rang Mahotsavam (BRM) International Theatre Festival of India 2020.

The school’s letter said: “As per the law, nudity and obscenity are banned in public performances. It was also verified from the DVD submitted by you that while applying for the participation in BRM, there is no scene of nudity in the said play.’’

Suveeran, an NSD alumnus, replied that it was absurd to argue that rules of “public places” were applicable to work of art. “If nudity can enhance the total feel of the play, it can be used even for public staging. This is what I feel as a director. Incidentally, the play was staged at Puducherry in a closed place, before an invited audience,’’ he said. Suveeran also dismissed the NSD argument that the DVD submitted did not contain nude scenes.

“…the DVD submitted is for quality analysis. A play is not a mechanical imitation of the video documentation of its first performance. The organic nature of the play gives the director freedom to intervene and improve the performance in each ensuing stage,’’ he argued.

Suveeran said the play’s protagonist, a servile character, had almost always been naked. “He is clad in a torn dhoti. The cloth often slips, exposing nudity. This culminates in the final scene in which he runs away naked,” he said.

The director said it was a pity to explain such nuances to an institution like NSD, “which had a rich legacy of promoting experimental plays as part of its academic endeavours.”

Suveeran recalled that as a student, he was given highest marks for a play in which an actor was presented nude.

IIT Kharagpur

KHARAGPUR: A third-year mathematics student at IIT Kharagpur , Ayush Kumar Mondal, on Wednesday fell from the second-floor balcony of Lal Bahadur Sasthri Hall on the campus. Mondal is critical but stable.

On hearing a loud thud around 7.45am, Ayush’s friends and hostel staffers rushed out to find him him lying on the ground, bleeding. IIT-Kgp’s security staff and cops from the Hijli police outpost rushed to spot and carried Ayush to the campus hospital. From there, he was referred to West Bank Hospital in Howrah. Confirming the fall, Kharagpur ASP Quazi Shamsuddin Ahmed said, “Our preliminary investigation shows it was a suicide bid. But we are probing whether there was any other cause.”

IIT-Kgp’s registrar B N Singh said, “We are yet to ascertain how he fell. He has been sent to Kolkata for treatment. He lived with his mother in an accommodation on the campus. We are trying to find out why he went to Lal Bahadur Sasthri Hall.”

Mondal, a resident of Bhilai, took admission in 2017-18. He was allotted a room at LBS Hall and later, at Nehru Hall. After his family reported he was undergoing mental treatment , IIT authorities allotted him a one-bedroom accommodation on the campus so that he could stay with his mother. On Wednesday morning, his mother had gone to the Technology market, when Ayush went to LBS hall. “At times, he would stay in his Nehru Hall room, which was right next to the warden’s office so that he could be under 24-hour supervision,” a source said.

After initial treatment at BC Roy Technology Hospital, Ayush’s mother, classmate, a hostel staffer and a doctor accompanied him to the Howrah hospital. Though he was referred to Medica, it was decided to send him to West Bank, which was nearer. “It appears he had landed on his feet. There are multiple fractures on his legs for which he will undergo a surgery on Thursday. His father arrived in Kolkata on Wednesday evening,” a source said.

229,['27/02/2020'],Locks of hope: MBA students donate hair for cancer patients,"This story is from February 27, 2020

This is the third year that PSG institute of management has organised a hair donation drive.

COIMBATORE: First-year MBA student Kavya S Menon, from PSG Institute of Management , grew up watching her grandmother suffer from cancer. She also noticed that one of the issues that caused her most pain, was losing her thick hair, which she was proud of. On Wednesday, when her college organized a hair donation drive to make free wigs for cancer patients, she was one of the first ones to sign up. At least 70 students also joined Kavya in donating a lock of hair each.

While wigs are available for cancer patients, who lose hair as part of the chemotherapy, good quality ones are usually extremely expensive, making it unaffordable for many people. Good wigs made of natural hair is also rare because it often requires more than six sets of people’s entire hair to make one wig.

Kavya said growing up in a family, where they had several cancer patients including her grandmother, she could always relate to the various issues they face, besides the treatment. “Knowing the heart ache my grandmother bore, giving up a lock of hair is just a small change I have made to make a cancer patient feel better,” she said.

This is the third year that PSG institute of management has organized a hair donation drive. “We tied up with Green Trends salon which cuts and takes the locks of hair, makes it into wigs and distributes it among hospitals. We expect PSG Hospitals to receive a few wigs,” said Vijaya P, director, PSGIM.

“For women, hair makes a big part of their appearance. To give away a part of it feels like giving a small portion of yourself, but we encourage our students to be socially sensitive,” she said.

Along with the students, nearly 15 faculty members too joined in contributing a lock of hair. “ The salon suggested collecting just one lock of hair from the middle portion, so that it does not make any difference in appearance. This in turn will prompt more girls to come forward,” said K Kokilambal, who contributed a 10-inch long lock of her thick hair. “ I think this is the least we can do to help a cancer fighter feel better.”

Kolkata: The sharp decline in overseas travel following the novel coronavirus outbreak continues to haunt flights to South East Asia with airlines rationalising services or stopping flights altogether to reduce mounting losses.

After China Eastern Airlines stopped flights to Kunming and IndiGo suspended flights to Hong Kong and Guangzhou, Thai Airways sister carrier Thai Smile has prematurely withdrawn services between Bangkok and Kolkata. Sources in the aviation industry said the airline, which was planning to discontinue flights from March 28, advanced the suspension of services to mid-February to reduce operational losses.

IndiGo and SpiceJet, too, are slashing flights to Bangkok, the most well-connected overseas destination with Kolkata. While IndiGo, which has twice-daily flights, will suspend one flight between February 29 and March 2, SpiceJet has decided to drop the daily flight 10 days in March.

Cathey Pacific has also announced the suspension of sister carrier Cathay Dragon ’s flights between Hong Kong and Kolkata from March 9 to March 20. In India, the airline has already reduced the number of flights from 49 a week to 26. “All airlines are rationalising flights in view of poor traffic.

Tirupur: Coimbatore MP P R Natarajan, along with his counterparts in Tirupur and Karur, visited a village here on Wednesday and interacted with farmers, who have long been opposing erection of high-tension (HT) transmission towers on their farmlands.

Natarajan, Karur MP S Jothimani and Tirupur MP K Subbarayan said they visited Anupatti village for taking stock of the situation and to express solidarity with the farmers, who have been fighting the Power Grid Corporation of India’s move to erect transmission towers on their farm lands as part of the Raigarh-Pugalur high-voltage direct transmission line project.

Natarajan said the high-tension power lines would have an adverse effect on farming as well as the health of public and sought the state government to scrap the project.

Criticizing the state government for allowing the project without taking into account the health of public, Natarajan urged the government to heed the demands of the farmers.

Jothimani said, “The government claims to be farmer friendly. However, granting permission to erect high-tension lines through farmlands proves that the government is not keen on the welfare of farmers. When the farmers protest for their livelihood and health, they are being portrayed as anti-development.’’

to boost productivity

PUNE: The Savitribai Phule Pune University ’s (SPPU) exam department plans to reduce the examination period from over 100 days to 45-55 days in each of the two sessions in an academic year.

The newly appointed controller of examination, Mahesh Kakade, said the pressure of the extended exam was directly felt by the department, which resulted in low productivity. He said efforts were being taken to reduce the examination days and also introduce innovative methods , such as “exam on demand”.

Kakade said he would have to study the ground situation with availability of infrastructure, manpower, student count, facilities and provisions for online examinations to implement all the changes.

“I have recently taken charge of the department and am in the process of studying the ground situation. However, some of these changes will be implemented immediately and we will reduce the exam period at SPPU step-by-step,” he said.

For the upcoming summer exam, some changes would be made on a pilot-basis at one of the university departments to see how the system would work before scaling it up at the college-level, he said.

Kakade said the changes would not impact the time students got for preparation. The department would ensure enough gaps between two papers. “The decision will speed up the evaluation process and help in declaration of results on time,” he said. Kakade said when he was with Shivaji Vidyapeeth, Kolhapur, he had undertaken similar measures.

At Shivaji Vidyapeeth, he said, the summer exam session was reduced to 57 from 90 days. Similarly, the winter session was reduced to 22 days from 42. Kakade said the science faculty examinations took the maximum time and stretched to 42 days. Examinations for the other faculties were finished within 18-20 days.

“As per the exam on demand method four unique question papers would be set for a particular subject. Students can choose one of the four dates to give the exam. This will reduce the man-hour and the exam will be conducted online in computer labs,” Kakade said.

He said if a paper had 80 marks, there could be a policy of conducting 40 marks online and 40 as theory. This would enable the department to conduct more exams on a single day. He added that the multiple faculty exams, such as arts and science, could be conducted simultaneously with the right combination of subjects,

Besides, all Saturdays during the exam period would be made working days and exams of non-credit subjects, such as environmental science, could be conducted on Sundays.

PUNE: The city police have invoked provisions of the MPID Act against NCP MLC Anil Bhosale and three others in the alleged Rs 71.78 crore fraud at the Shivajirao Bhosale Cooperative Bank.The police told a special MPID court on Wednesday that 1,187 investors had so far approached them with complaints that the bank had misappropriated investments totally worth Rs 52.92 crore.Investigating officer (IO) Murlidhar Karpe told the court, “The number of affected investors and the quantum of embezzled amount is likely to grow further as more investors are approaching the police. Hence, the provisions of the Maharashtra Protection of Interest of Depositors (MPID) Act have been invoked.”In a related development, deputy commissioner of police (economic offences) Sambhaji Kadam said a separate case related to misappropriation of Rs1.5 crore would soon be filed against MLC Bhosale and others with the Deccan Gymkhana police. “We are expecting the amount to increase further,” he said.“A letter has been sent to the state home department for hiring a forensic auditor to establish the money trail in the case registered with the Shivajinagar police that resulted in Tuesday night’s four arrests,” he added.Defence lawyers S K Jain, Harshad Nimbalkar, Rushikesh Ganu and Bipin Patole complained that the MPID Act and the Indian Penal Code (IPC) had been invoked to bypass the remedy under the Maharashtra Cooperatives Societies (MCS) Act, a special enactment.Karpe and his team produced the four arrested persons before special MPID judge S S Gosavi. Additional public prosecutor Vilas Patare moved a remand report, arguing that the investigators had collected sufficient evidence to establish that the allegations against the arrested persons were well-founded and a 14-day custodial remand was needed for recovery of cash. The court ordered such remand till March 6.“No special treatment for any accused,” judge Gosavi said in a stern voice after Bhosale’s lawyer Harshad Nimbalkar orally mentioned that his client suffered from a heavy diabetic condition and needed food as well as medical attention.The judge told the IO to ensure that Bhosale was not sent to a private hospital without a prior report to the court and its permission. He, however, allowed access to food and medicine “as per provisions of law”.Earlier, lawyers Jain and Nimbalkar, both representing Bhosale, argued that custodial interrogation was not required as the case was based on documents in possession of the investigating machinery.“Recovery of cash need not require custody of the accused,” said Jain.Nimbalkar submitted, “As the chairman of the bank, Bhosale was responsible for strategic decisions and had no direct role in running day-to-day affairs of the bank. Hence, his remand was not required.”Lawyer Ganu, representing Jadhav, submitted that prior permission under Section 148 of the MCS Act was required and there was no need to apply the IPC sections as the cooperatives registrar has powers to inquire into the matter.",pune,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74327362,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-824856,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/police-invoke-mpid-provisions-against-mlc-bhosale-3-others/articleshow/74326183.cms

AHMEDABAD: The Gujarat government seems to have taken a leaf out of Arvind Kejriwal’s successful Delhi model as it announced new scheme that aims to develop 500 state-run schools as ‘Schools of Excellence’ by the end of March next year. The scheme is part of the state government’s massive budget outlay of Rs 31,955 crore for the education sector.“Our government has implemented a number of schemes to brighten the future of India taking shape in the classrooms. I announce, ‘Schools of Excellence Scheme’ to ensure quality education in government schools,” Gujarat deputy chief minister Nitin Patel, who also holds the finance portfolio, announced on Wednesday while unveiling the state budget for 2020-21.Talented teachers from taluka level will be identified to impart global standard education in these schools, the minister said.The Aam Aadmi Party, which won again in the Delhi state elections, had made quality education in government schools one of its major poll planks.A provision of Rs 250 crore has been made for the scheme which includes providing modern infrastructural facilities, smart classrooms, computer labs, STEM labs and sports facilities, according to the budget document.“In the pilot phase, about 500 schools will be developed as schools of excellence during 2020-21,” said Vinod Rao, secretary, primary and secondary education.Separate sub-head has also been provided in the budget for ‘External Assistance Funding for Schools of Excellence’ so that it could be scaled up in the next 5 years.The broader vision is to convert about 15,000 primary schools (with more than 150 students) and about 5,000 secondary and higher secondary schools into schools of excellence in the next 5 years, Rao said.The state government’s share of funds will be dovetailed with that received from the Centre, external funding agencies, NABARD and other sources to realize the mission for Schools of Excellence, Rao said.The mission will also focus on intensive training and capacity building of teachers by strengthening of GCERT and DIETs.All this will help in improving ‘grade appropriate learning outcomes’ and ‘higher order thinking skills’ across all schools so that Gujarat can participate in Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) in 2024, Rao added.The budget has also made provision to the tune of Rs 650 crore for school infrastructure; Rs 188 crore to Gujarat Institute of Educational Technology for setting up command and control centre, computer labs and education-technology interventions, and Rs 125 crore for smart classrooms across schools during 2020-21.",ahmedabad,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74327325,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-689957,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/on-lines-of-delhi-gujarat-floats-school-reforms-scheme/articleshow/74326334.cms

Teachers being trained in the city on Monday

COIMBATORE: The National Achievement Survey (NAS), conducted by the National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT) last year, which aims to assess the competency of school students , had ranked the state ‘significantly below the national average’ in reading comprehension, mathematics, science and social science.

Following this, the state has been conducting a ‘Post-NAS training’ for government schoolteachers who handle classes IX and X. Based on the results of the survey, the State Council of Educational Research and Training (SCERT) has trained resource persons, who have been training the teachers from Monday. The session would conclude on Saturday.

In Coimbatore, a total of 1,899 teachers are being trained by 48 resource persons in centres across the district. Officials of Samagra Shiksha, which has been conducting the sessions, said the sessions were being conducted at a budget of Rs6lakh. “The sessions aim at training teachers to improve the outcome in students,” said the official.

“It has been found that our students were lagging in answering questions which require them to apply their conceptual understanding. If a question is twisted, they find it difficult to answer,” he said. “The training would inform teachers how to make students understand the concepts and apply them,” he added.

This would help students not only to tackle competitive and assessment exams such as the NAS, but also their board exams, as under the new syllabus, much of the questions required them to apply their understanding, said resource persons.

K Ravichandran, a mathematics resource person, said while the pass percentage in exams was being given more prominence, the idea of the training session was to increase the students’ competency. “While the training we give teachers, would help students tackle competitive exams better, eventually it aims to enhance the regular classroom teaching as well,” he said.

Ananthi, a resource person for English, said they train teachers to improve the listening, reading, writing, vocabulary and grammar competencies of students. Around 30% of the questions under the new syllabus was based on the thinking ability of the students, she said. “The focus is to manifest an outcome-based education in schools,” she said.

It focused heavily on measures to streamline traffic.Last year, former standing committee chairman Yogesh Mulik had presented a Rs 6,765 crore budget about Rs 680 crore more than former municipal commissioner Saurabh Rao’s.“Daily commute for citizens has become tiresome and we need to take steps now before the situation worsens,” Rasne said.Funds were set aside for the construction of 18 flyovers, bridges and grade separators proposed in the last few years in many parts of the city, Rasne said.Starting with Rs 230 crore for ongoing infrastructure projects, Rasne proposed the development of new road links, construction of more bridges and flyovers.A grade separator at Lal Mahal chowk on Shivaji Road at a cost of Rs 4 crore was proposed to reduce traffic congestion in the core areas. “We will ask experts and urban planners to advise us on how it can be executed with minimum hardship to citizens,” Rasne said.Activists said the project has not been given proper thought. “Shivaji Road is a congested area and digging up a single lane will lead to huge traffic jams,” Vivek Velankar of Sajag Nagrik Manch said.“WiIl a grade separator solve the traffic problem in an area which has illegal hawkers and shops? When the feasibility fizzles out, the allocations will be diverted to other projects,” Velankar added.The construction of a road from Bund Garden junction to Mundhwa bridge along the Mula-Mutha river and a new bridge in place of the Sadhu Vaswani bridge were proposed.Rasne said the development plan road will reduce the traffic burden on North Main Road. Velankar said the area is heavily encroached upon.Rasne also proposed midi-buses in the central areas with an allocation of Rs 25 crore to strengthen public transport and reduce the use of private vehicles.“We have proposed 32-seater buses with a Rs 10 ticket for the entire day. Buses will ply Deccan to Pulgate, Swargate to Pune station and Swargate to Shivajinagar routes. Bus trips will be introduced on a circular Swargate-Tilak Road-Khajinavihir-Appa Balwant Chowk-Pune station-Pulgate-Swargate route,” Rasne said.A coordinating officer at the zonal office level to oversee various works like concreting, digging up of roads for cabling, painting and markings on roads and work on footpaths was proposed.",pune,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74329535,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-733669,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/budget-to-fix-aggravating-traffic-with-new-roads-more-flyovers/articleshow/74326135.cms

Madurai: The Madras high court has issued notice to the state government on a plea by a man who sought Rs 1 crore compensation for his minor daughter who was raped and murdered in 2011, citing that police officials and other agencies were not able to crack the case.

In the petition, K Kalaikumar, a resident of Pudukottai district, stated that his daughter, a Class X student was raped and brutally murdered by some unidentified people when he and his wife who were working as headmaster and teacher respectively at government schools had gone to work on March 9, 2011. His daughter was found hanging from the fan with stab injuries on her head and stomach.

He said that his five-year-old son who was in the house at the time of the incident told him that some unidentified people had entered the house and attacked the girl and stole 25 sovereign gold jewellery from the house.

Initially, the case was registered with the Ganesh Nagar police and later transferred to the CB-CID and subsequently to the CBI. Kalaikumar stated that the investigation in the case was not conducted in a proper manner since the beginning and the perpetrators in this case have not been found yet.

On October 10, 2019, the CBI had submitted a closure report citing their inability to collect prima facie evidence to link the suspect accused to the case before the Trichy chief judicial magistrate court and the court had accepted the same.

Since the authorities whose primary duty is to prevent, detect, register and investigate crime and prosecute criminals have failed to crack the case and find the perpetrators in this case, the petitioner moved the high court Madurai bench seeking compensation from the state government.

When the case was taken up for hearing on Wednesday, justice A D Jagadish Chandira issued notice to the state and adjourned the case to a further hearing.

Each polling station will have a maximum of up to 1,400 voters. The stations will be equipped with basic amenities, including drinking water, sanitation, ramps and lights, the commissioner said.

‘singing bishop’: Late Bishop Valerian D’Souza during a church service in Germany

PUNE: Like a cut gem, there were many facets to Rt Rev Valerian D’Souza — avid sportsman in his youth, multilinguist, powerful orator, singer, guitarist, champion of the poor and, above all, a spiritual leader.

“Indeed, Bishop D’Souza was a man of many talents. He was also a local at heart, a complete Pune man,” recalls Bishop of Pune Thomas Dabre, who stepped into Bishop D’Souza’s shoes after the latter’s retirement in 2009.

Bishop D’Souza passed away of multi-organ failure at a city hospital on Tuesday night. He was 86. He had served as Bishop of Pune for nearly 32 years from 1977. After retirement, he held the title of Emeritus Bishop.

Bishop D’Souza studied at St Vincent’s high school and Nowrosjee Wadia, excelling in both academics and sports. He captained his college football and hockey teams and represented the Pune university too in those games. He trained for priesthood at Papal Seminary and later in Germany.

“Fluent in English, Bishop D’Souza was comfortable with speaking Marathi and Hindi too. During his four-year priesthood training in Germany, he picked up German, which he spoke very well. His sermons in that language were popular,” Bishop Dabre told TOI. He also remembers the late Bishop’s singing and guitar skills, for which he was known as the “Singing Bishop”.

Fr Malcolm Sequeira, vicar-general of the Pune diocese, recalls Bishop D’Souza’s special concern for the poor. “He would often hand over money to me which well-wishers had given him. ‘Help some poor family with this money. God gives me and I must share what I get,’ he would say. He firmly believed that one gets more when one gives to the poor.”

Fr Sequeira commended the late Bishop’s knowledge of sports. “He would avidly watch cricket, soccer and tennis on TV and give us all the updates at the dinner table. He would observe such fine points of the game that we were left wondering how a busy man like him paid such attention to sports,” he said..

Cardinal Oswald Gracias, the Archbishop of Bombay, will conduct Bishop’s D’Souza’s funeral mass at the St Patrick’s Cathedral at 11.30am on Thursday, followed by the burial at the City Church cemetery at Nana Peth. The body will be kept for public viewing at the cathedral from 9am.

The urban development department has made a provision of Rs 4,544 crore to boost basic infrastructure in cities and nagarpalikas under the Swarnim Jayanti Mukhya Mantri Shaheri Vikas Yojana.A big portion of this budget, Rs 1,169 crore will be spent to spruce up underground civic facilities — drainage, storm water drains — while Rs 500 crore has been allocated for municipal water networks. To improve traffic management in cities, Rs 200 crore has been provisioned for de-congesting railway crossings, and another Rs 500 crore for bridges and flyovers.",ahmedabad,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74328557,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-639667,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/with-eye-on-local-body-polls-urban-infra-gets-a-boost/articleshow/74326331.cms

The sight of broken pipes laid to create a makeshift culvert near Prayeja city — off Sinhagad Road — sparked fears of future flooding among residents this week. Their worries are not unfounded. Last year, this area was one of the worst hit by floods during heavy rains in September.Locals have now urged the PMC to finish the clean-up at the site as soon as possible. They said the civic body should ensure the nullah is channelised properly. Officials, while responding to a TOI query, sought to assuage fears saying the pipes (pictured), are only part of temporary measures and that they will be removed once a new culvert is built at the spot.Neighbourhoods in Katraj, Sahakarnagar, Satara road, Katraj-Kondhwa road, Indiranagar, Bibvewadi and Sinhagad Road suffered massive damage during the flooding that occurred on the night of September 25, 2019. The flood swept away the walls of a crematorium on Sinhagad Road and wiped out two culverts, including this one at Prajeya City. “We only want the PMC to ensure sewage flowing through the nullah is channeled correctly. The area was severely hit by flooding last year. The disaster hit not just residents, but also commuters who used the culvert,” said Dnyanesh Deolalikar, a local resident.Parikshit Karve, a resident of Sinhagad Road, said: “The road adjacent to the nullah is important as it connects the Sinhagad road area with the Pune-Bengaluru highway. Many people going to Wakad and Hinjewadi use this road. It will be a big worry if there are flash floods here again.”Others said there have been severe traffic jams in the area since the floods last year.“The road was shut after the floods. Commuters along Sun City Road and main Sinhagad Road felt the impact. A bridge has now been proposed here to resolve the problem,” said resident Deepak Nagpure. The PMC’s decision to pull down the flood-damaged bridge near Prayeja city had indeed impacted the movement of traffic from Anandnagar, Wadgaon, Dhayari, Narhe and other localities near Sinhagad Road. But the civic body said a new structure is in the works.“The tender for the bridge has been approved. Construction will start in March,” said Vitthal Ingawale, a senior PMC official who is working on the project.Ingawale said the broken pipes have been laid at the site as a temporary diversion measure. “They will be removed once the bridge is completed,” he added.Many amenities such as gardens, a water pumping station, cultural halls and schools were damaged in the floods. Officials with the PMC said the civic body has set in place a number of measures to ensure a repeat of 2019 doesn’t happen.They include a protective mesh along nullahs; reconstruction of culverts and roads along the nullahs; action against illegal constructions and encroachments; and a survey of properties along drains. The new bridge near Prayeja city is a part of this project.",pune,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74329323,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1215129,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/on-sinhagad-road-many-hope-for-a-flood-free-year/articleshow/74326147.cms

PUNE: An IndiGo flight to Nagpur was delayed on Wednesday by almost five hours, much to the flyers’ inconvenience.

The flight (6E-134) took off from Pune at 4.05pm, five hours after its scheduled departure at 11.05am. The delay had a cascading effect, as the same aircraft (Airbus A320 Neo) was supposed to fly to Delhi at 1pm. It departed at 5.43pm.

Several Nagpur-bound flyers took to the social media to express their grievances.

“Still no information about my flight and sitting at the airport since. The airline should have informed about such delay. Will it fly today or cancelled? Please revert,” Hemang Parikh, a passenger, posted on Twitter.

When the airline replied that the flight had been delayed due to operational reasons, Parikh reposted, “When will you inform? From last 5 hours have been in the airport without any clarity. Will this flight leave from Nagpur today? Atleast tell this. Really very sad state of affairs,” he said.

Prasanna Patil, another passenger, tweeted about how flyers were made to undergo security check all over again and given fresh boarding passes at the last minute.

IndiGo was sent a detailed mail in the evening, but an answer was awaited till the time of going to the press. A source said, “There was a delay of four hours and 45 minutes to be exact. There was a technical issue but nothing related to the engine of the aircraft.”

The airline, while replying to queries by passengers, said on Twitter that the flight had been delayed because of operational reasons.

PUNE: Standing committee chairman Hemant Rasne, who said concrete measures are needed to increase the Pune Municipal Corporation’s finances, has backed efforts to explore additional revenue sources and boosting tax collection.

He presented a Rs 7,390 crore municipal budget, Rs 1,161 crore more than municipal commissioner Shekhar Gaikwad’s draft budget of Rs 6,229 crore.

Rasne put forth seven broad ideas to boost revenue and increase tax collection. He did not announce any hike in property tax .

“We observed a gap between the targeted revenue and actual collection after reviewing the budget performances of the last ten years. We will minimize this gap and boost revenue,” Rasne said.

An amnesty scheme in two steps is expected to fetch Rs 1,000 crore revenue. “A plan will be chalked out to recover tax arrears from cellphone companies. A way to curb lapses in collection of property tax and recover arrears which have increased to Rs 4,200 crore will be announced,” Rasne said.

A three-step payment system for builders on development charges will be rolled out. “At present, developers pay at one go. We will allow these payments in three steps to boost projects,” Rasne said.

New schemes that increase the revenue from advertisements will be announced. There is a plan to rent out spaces on foot overbridges and gantries at 200 locations for advertisements.

Spaces on bridges, flyovers and gardens will also be sourced for revenue generation from advertisements.

A scheme will be introduced to collect arrears of taxes from rented spaces of Pune Municipal Corporation-owned buildings and a retired judge would be appointed to clear pending revenue related cases.

The standing committee also proposed to widen and redevelop six-metre wide roads in the city and in the 34 merged villages to boost construction activities in the fringe areas.

PUNE: A caller posing as an army colonel duped a restaurant owner of Rs 72,000 on the pretext of ordering food for 40 of his men and then acquiring the details of the restaurateur’s debit card, including one-time password, to pay for the order online on Sunday.

“The caller sought the OTP under the garb of security code that, he claimed, was required for an army software to make online payments,” inspector Ashok Shelke of the Haveli police said.

Restaurant owner Manish Tukaram Kadu (30) of Gorhe village on Sinhagad-Panshet Road lodged a complaint with the Haveli police on Monday. According to the FIR, Kadu’s father was at the restaurant when he received a call from an unknownnumber on Sunday morning.

The caller, who introduced himself as an army colonel, told Kadu’s father that there was an army camp in Panshet and he required 40 ‘vegetarian meals’ for his men in the evening.

In the evening, Kadu’s father received another call from the same person, who promised to pay for the order online. He then asked Kadu’s father to share his son’s phone number with him, the police said.

Later, the conman called Kadu to seek his bank account and debit card details. Kadu shared his debit card details, including the CVV number. “The caller then told him that he would receive a security code on his cellphone. However, Kadu received an OTP, which he shared with the conman,” the officer said.

Soon after Kadu shared the OTP, the suspect transferred Rs72,000 from his bank account. “The preliminary investigation has traced the phone numbers and the account to Jamtara in Jharkhand,” Shelke said,

NEW DELHI: Joining the debate on the issue of leadership crisis, Congress MP and spokesman Manish Tewari said Sonia Gandhi should continue as the party president for “foreseeable future”, calling it the overwhelming opinion of the Congress rank and file.

At the same time, senior member Anil Shastri demanded that Priyanka Gandhi Vadra should be appointed the Congress president as he rejected the possibility of a non-Gandhi leading the party. He was reacting to calls for election for the post of Congress chief as demanded by Congress MP Shashi Tharoor.

Amid views that it was time for Congress to move beyond Sonia Gandhi who became an interim chief after Rahul Gandhi ’s resignation last May, Tewari said, “Overwhelming consensus in Congress is that we need Sonia as president for foreseeable future. It is the view of leaders across the parliamentary group as well as of those in other positions in the organisation and those whom I have known since my days in the NSUI four decades ago.”

Tewari added that Congress should stick to Sonia Gandhi till the party sorts out its ideological conundrum which requires immediate attention. He stressed that the party should hold a “Panchmarhi type” brainstorming conclave.

“The hunt for new president can take months or even a year or two,” he said.

The comments from the Lok Sabha MP from Punjab add to the growing voices in the party over the leadership issue which started after Rahul Gandhi resigned as president following the Lok Sabha defeat in May 2019. The Congress Working Committee appointed Sonia Gandhi as “interim president” in August.

Tewari noted that Rahul Gandhi was emphatic in his resignation and even turned down pleas from party leaders to take back his decision.

In contrast, Anil Shastri appeared to weigh against the call for election to the top organisational post. “There’s no question of a non-Gandhi taking over as Congress president. Priyanka Gandhi should be elected to lead the party.”

The court produced the order talking cognizance of the fact that there is no separate lane for ambulances

MADURAI: The Madras high court on Wednesday restrained toll collection at Vandiyur toll plaza from 9am on February 27, taking cognizance of the fact that there is no separate lane for ambulances and other exempted vehicles.

A division bench of justice M Duraiswamy and justice T Ravindran passed the interim order while hearing a batch of petitions against collection of toll at three new toll plazas on the Madurai ring road.

The counsels appearing for the petitioners submitted that the toll was being collected at Vandiyur toll plaza without providing a lane for ambulance.

A senior counsel appearing for the Sri Balaji Tollways (Madurai) Private Limited, which is collecting the toll at the toll plazas, submitted that steps were being taken to expand the road at Vandiyur toll plaza. He further submitted that they would not collect toll from the Vandiyur toll plaza till the work was completed.

The judges also directed them not indirectly collect the toll for Vandiyur toll plaza at the other two toll plazas, located at Chintamani and Valayankulam. The case was adjourned to March 26 for further hearing.

It maybe recalled that these batch of petitions were filed challenging collection of toll fee at three new toll plazas set up at Vandiyur, Chintamani and Valayankulam, which are located on the 27km stretch in Madurai. The petitioners stated that several vehicles ply on the road every day as several educational institutions, hospitals and Madurai Airport are situated on the stretch. Due to this, functioning of these toll plazas have also resulted in traffic congestion at the stretch.

Representative Image

Coimbatore: The number of beneficiaries from the district who have got capital subsidy through the state’s ‘New Entrepreneur Cum Enterprise Development Scheme’ (NEEDS) has come down in the past three years, according to data from the District Industries Centre (DIC).

Correspondingly, the total subsidy amount given also has come down.

In 2017-18, the total subsidy given under the scheme was Rs1,199.23lakh, which came down to Rs752lakh in 2019-2020 (as on February 19).

Under the scheme, up till now, educated youth who are first generation entrepreneurs would be given a capital loan subsidy of 25% of the cost of starting a new enterprise, up to a ceiling of Rs30lakh. State finance minister O Panneerselvam, in his budget speech earlier this month announced that the subsidy would be increased from Rs30lakh to Rs50lakh. He also announced a fund of Rs100crore for the scheme in the budget estimate of 2020-21.

While this is expected to give a shot in the arm for the scheme and is expected to increase the number of potential beneficiaries applying for and receiving the subsidy under it, the trend in the past three years show that the annual subsidy amount and the total number of beneficiaries in the district have come down.

Officials of the DIC said this could be due to selection process of the scheme involving an interview and a training programme, which could be reasons for the fall in numbers. “It could also be because aspiring entrepreneurs from the service sector, who form the core of the beneficiaries, have not been coming up for the scheme. We would analyse the reasons for the fall in numbers and come up with interventions,” said B Karthigaivasan, general manager of DIC Coimbatore.

Industrialists, on the other hand, said the overall reason could be the apprehension among aspiring entrepreneurs due to the prevailing unfavourable economic situation. The slowdown and its effects might have made aspiring entrepreneurs apprehensive as to whether they could find proper business activity to repay the loan they avail through the scheme.

There must be good cash flow in the industry for new entrepreneurs to boldly start industries, said J James, district president of Tamil Nadu Association of Cottage and Micro Enterprises (TACT).

“The NEEDS is a very helpful one for new entrepreneurs. But, due to the current economic situation, many aspiring entrepreneurs could have backed up from starting new businesses and so the fall in numbers under the scheme,” he said.

Beneficiaries of the NEEDS said the scheme had provided them with much needed support at the time of starting a business. They too echoed the same idea that the current economic situation could have caused the fall in numbers.

M Azmathullah, whose wife M T Kurushith had availed a loan subsidy through the NEEDS scheme in 2014, said the loan subsidy amount of around Rs20lakh came as a solid support for them to start a footwear jobwork unit in Malumichampatti near the city. “I have also suggested other aspiring entrepreneurs to apply for the scheme,” he said. “But right from the demonetization move, the situation for industries has not been great. That, and the slowdown, could have kept off many from starting new businesses, and availing loans through such schemes,” he said.

Bengaluru: The government launched a digital library on Wednesday, which will provide access to books available at 272 state public libraries, except those with copyrights.

Launching e-Sarvajanika Granthalaya, primary and secondary education Suresh Kumar said it is a matter of pride that the country’s IT capital is also taking the lead in digital education by digitising books on such a large scale.

“Citizens can read their favourite books and magazines from the comfort of their homes. We are sure this will improve reading habit of youngsters and others. This application aims to increase readership among citizens,” the minister said.

The project to digitise over 1 lakh titles was taken up by the department of public libraries to modernise libraries with technology and digital infrastructure to bridge the gap in access to information.

The library will have e-books and journals, covering more than 10 subjects like arts and humanities, science and technology, classics and literature, in seven languages.

The project is considered to be a first in the country, where a state-level initiative has been taken up to digitise and provide access to learning in such a large scale. This project covers city central libraries (26), district central libraries (30)and taluk libraries (216) across Karnataka.

Calling it a cultural shift, Kumar said 95,000 English books are available on the platform. “It is time authors and publishers welcomed this change,” he said, assuring that digitisation won’t affect publishers.

Since the last couple of days (Tuesday and Wednesday), northerly winds in the lower atmospheric level have been exclusively affecting northern parts of the state, especially north and central Madhya Maharashtra, including Pune.”He said had it been the start of the winter season, the kind of northerly flow that the city has been recently witnessing would have dragged the minimum temperature further down to 10ºC, or even below. “But since it is almost the end of winter season, the dip was till 12.2ºC,” he said.Northerly winds began penetrating parts of the state after the passage of the western disturbance over north India. “Once a western disturbance passes, it generally causes a drop in temperature if there is no hindrance in the northerly wind flow,” he said.The drop in temperature may be short-lived, as both the day and night temperatures should start rising from Thursday. “Night temperatures may rise due to the partly cloudy conditions from Thursday caused by a line of discontinuity over Konkan and Madhya Maharashtra areas during the next few days. The day temperatures will also rise, as the easterly wind flow may replace the northerly wind flow,” Kashyapi said.",pune,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74327369,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-130453,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/winters-parting-shot-4c-slide-in-day-night-temps/articleshow/74326274.cms

AURANGABAD: Prakash Ambedkar-led Vanchit Bahujan Aghadi ( VBA ) has called for a mega protest at Delhi’s Jantar Mantar on March 4 against the implementation of the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), National Population Register (NPR) and National Register of Citizens (NRC).

As per the announced schedule, the data collection exercise for NPR is set to begin in the country, except on Assam , from April.

Ambedkar on Wednesday released a video appealing to citizens to join him in the protest. “What we feared is becoming a reality. NPR is the beginning. The rights that the country earned through the work of Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar will be lost. Citizens have to fight to retain their rights,” he said.

Activists privy to the preparation of the agitation said their biggest concern is that poor, backward communities will suffer the most.

“People, who have not understood this issue, are the ones supporting it. They will end up regretting it,” said Nayab Ansari , a close confidante of Ambedkar.

An official with the administration said the NPR is a register of usual residents of the country prepared at the local, tehsil, district, state and nation levels under the provisions of Citizenship Act 1955 and Citizenship (Registration of Citizens and issue of National Identity Cards) Rules, 2003.

RAMPUR: Senior Samajwadi Party (SP) leader and Rampur MP Azam Khan , his wife Tanzeen Fatimah and son Abdullah Azam were sent to judicial custody of six days by additional district and sessions judge Dhirendra Kumar Kamboj on Wednesday after the trio surrendered before the court in Rampur in a case involving the alleged forging of Abdullah’s birth certificate. The former UP cabinet minister along with his wife and son have been sent to the district jail and the next date of hearing is March 2.

The court while rejecting the anticipatory bail pleas of the three SP leaders had earlier declared them “absconders”. A local court on Tuesday had ordered “confiscation of their moveable and immovable properties” in connection with the forgery case.

The family had been ignoring court summons and were chargesheeted under various sections of the IPC for allegedly helping Abdullah obtain two fake birth certificates. Abdullah had allegedly gave an incorrect date of birth while filing his nomination papers for the assembly election. Following a high court order, he had lost his membership of the state assembly last December after he was found guilty of forgery. Azam and his kin have been booked in as many as 47 cases, ranging from ""book theft"" to land grab. The father-son duo were allegedly also involved in 11 criminal cases.

Dismissing the charges as “politically motivated”, Azam said he is “not just a foot soldier, but a warrior”. Several SP workers from Moradabad, Sambhal and Rampur had assembled outside the court room which had a heavy police presence.

Raising Azam’s health concerns before the court, counsel Khalilullah Khan said his client is a patient with blood pressure issues and is in need of regular medical attention. To this, the court said Azam and his wife ""will be provided with all the facilities which an MP and MLA should get in custody”.

Rampur district magistrate Aunjaneya Kumar Singh told TOI, “Azam Khan, his wife Tanzeen Fatimah and son Abdullah Azam will get adequate security inside the jail as per the manual and they will be kept in the general barracks along with other prisoners.” Sources further said they would be kept in “barrack number 1”.

SP’s Sambhal unit president Feroz Khan said, “Our leader has been booked under several cases, which are all fake.” Police reportedly detained an agitated local SP worker outside the court premises.

These entrepreneurs say that sustainability in a business is vital as it means generating profit while improving societal and environmental conditions, and that it is “the ethical responsibility of a business as well as its owner to be aware of the social and environmental issues prevailing and try to find out ways to improve the situation.”Nupur Agarwal and Abhinav Ahluwalia, founders of Evolve Foundation, a social enterprise that manufactures ‘plantable stationery’ and aims to contribute towards sustainable villages in Uttarakhand, say that women entrepreneurs especially are suitable for social enterprises as they have “sensitivity towards the environment and society.” “In our organisation, we help a rural family by buying seeds from the farmer, provide employment to local women who produce the products and conduct education workshops for their children,” says Agarwal, adding, “Every young person should aspire to start something that matters and should volunteer for at least a few hours in any area they would like, as it will not only lead to a better society but also help them learn more about themselves.”A few entrepreneurs are looking at reuse and recycle options in their businesses to make sure that they make the least demands on the environment. Like Joshua Hishey and Richa Ghansiyal, who run the Alaya Design Studio in Old Rajpur — which is in the custom design furniture business and also trains locals in the art of woodworking. “We consciously make an effort to integrate and explore design solutions based on restoration and renewable resources, recycling in our personal and professional assignments,” says Ghansiyal. She adds that “earlier, needs were few and addressed locally, while today we have created a world of desires.” “Consumption has become an activity that is creating more and more waste. For instance, in our fast-moving lives, meals have changed. From freshly made food, we have moved to packaged foods, where inevitably the packaging is something that needs to be disposed of, after one-time use. Any talk of sustainability cannot remain as a responsibility in the sphere of governance, environmental or otherwise, but has to be inculcated at each micro-task level. Therefore it is essential to teach sustainability within one’s immediate environment, natural or human-made.”For Ghayur and Patricia Alam, engaging with the local community is an integral part of their work. The couple runs Himalayan Weavers that produces shawls, stoles, rugs and scarves using only natural dyes. Wool is collected from villages in Gangotri and Himachal, and the work of dyeing and hand spinning is given to village women, thereby providing them employment. “Our greatest reward is the satisfaction of customers and the smiles on the faces of the women who work with us,” says the couple who operates out of Masrana, a small village near Mussoorie.A similar vision — of empowering locals — drives two friends, Tanya Kotnala, a fashion designer and Tanya Singh, a nutrition consultant. With an aim to create products that are “sustainable and ethnic”, the duo set up ‘Bhuli’(which means ‘little sister’ in Garhwali) in 2017 with the aim of promoting Uttarakhand’s unique art and craft culture. “Cultural preservation of every kind is important for society because it makes it more dynamic. I believe that it is also essential for supporting local artisans and businesses,” says Kotnala.",dehradun,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-47529300,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-110164,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/social-entrepreneurs-show-the-way-in-doing-sustainable-biz/articleshow/74324358.cms

MADURAI: Burial urns have been found in Konthagai village near Keeladi , which is being excavated in the sixth phase of excavation by the Tamil Nadu state archaeology department.

The sixth phase of excavation at Keeladi in Thirupuvanam taluk in Sivaganga district was inaugurated on February 19 by chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswami through video conferencing. Apart from Keeladi, three more villages - Konthagai, Manalur and Aharam - have also been taken up for excavation in this sixth phase.

On Wednesday, workers at Konthagai found the top portion of two burial urns. Konthagai is already said to be the burial site of the civilization that had thrived on the banks of river Vaigai over 2,600 years ago. Sources at the department of archaeology said that while burial urns have been found in many places in the state, brick structures were being revealed in Keeladi, and hence importance was given to Keeladi.

It will take a few days for the workers to work on the site and find out if the urns are intact or damaged. But, there are chances of finding many more urns in Konthagai, said sources.

Meanwhile, visitors have already started coming to Keeladi to witness the excavation process. It may be recalled that thousands of people thronged Keeladi after the report of the fourth phase of excavation was published by the archaeology department in August last year.

The temporary exhibition at the Tamil Sangam building in Madurai is drawing hundreds of people on a daily basis. Now, people have started thronging Keeladi already, though it has been just five days since the work began. In order to ensure that the public are not disappointed, he department has put up a photo exhibition at the site.

Among these 61 facilities, 42 are government-run centres.The rest 245 medical facilities openly dump bio-medical wastes in the residential areas which could trigger a spread of several diseases. The RTI was filed by Shiv Sena district president Charanjeet Pawha.Locals claim that hospitals and clinics do no not abide by the rules and dump their waste in public dustbins, due to which bio-medical waste gets mixed with domestic waste.Social activist Vishal Garg told TOI, “Sanitation facilities are in a bad shape in Haridwar and bio-medical waste is being dumped in the open and is getting mixed with domestic waste. This could lead to a spread of infections in the city but local officials are not taking concrete steps to address this issue.”When queried on the issue, Haridwar’s chief medical officer Saroj Naithani told TOI, “A total of 306 hospital, clinics, and pathology labs are registered under the Clinical Establishment (Registration and Regulation) Act in the city. We ask them to follow guidelines in regards to disposal of bio-medical waste. We will set up an inquiry into the matter and strict action will be taken against those who violate rules.”Notably, Haridwar generates around 250 metric tonnes of garbage (on an average) daily and Roorkee Municipal Corporation collects around 125 metric tonnes of it. During festival and religious fairs, the garbage quantity increases by 25%. “All this waste isn’t treated. In fact, Haridwar Municipal Corporation collects garbage from the city and dumps it in Sarai village. This continued dumping has triggered a health scare among the people who live there,” a local said.Meanwhile, Haridwar Municipal Corporation commissioner Narendra Singh Bhandari told TOI, “We do not collect bio-medical waste from hospitals or nursing homes. We have directed our sanitation workers to not collect waste from hospitals. We will take action if they are found dumping bio-medical waste in public dustbins.”",dehradun,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-47529300,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-110164,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/245-hosps-in-haridwar-do-not-have-facility-to-dispose-bio-medical-waste-reveals-rti/articleshow/74324371.cms

The standing committee had called for a special meeting on Wednesday to further, discuss the draft budget. “We have continued all the works proposed by the municipal commissioner, but have reduced the financial provisions of the projects by 20%, which is to be used for the various development works suggested by the panel members during the meeting,” said standing committee chairman Uddhav Nimse.

AURANGABAD: City police, taking a note of communal clashes and riots in Delhi, have appealed to the people to refrain from forwarding or sharing hate content or videos on the social media.

According to sources, the state police headquarters has asked the unit commanders to ensure there is visible police presence at all important places. Moreover, the reserve force has also been put on standby for responding to any untoward situation.

The appeal came after law enforcement agencies found that communally charged messages are rife on social media, and the messages are found to be aimed at flaring communal tensions. Police have also appealed to parents and guardians to keep a watch on their wards so that they do not, knowingly or unknowingly, forward hate messages and videos and end up facing criminal offences for the same.

Aurangabad commissioner of police Chiranjeev Prasad has issued an ultimatum of registering offences against anyone found spreading hatred from any medium.

“We are maintaining close vigil on notorious elements and anyone who pose a threat to city’s peace and communal harmony. We will take stringent action against them,” he said. The officer added that police will not hesitate from slapping cognizable offences against those committing mischief by trying to create communal tensions.

Pilibhit: Children playing on the premises of a government school in Keeratpur village, around 2.5km from Barahi forest range of the Pilibhit Tiger Reserve, had a narrow escape after a leopard entered the campus from adjacent fields and attacked a dog on Wednesday morning. The leopard killed the dog and dragged the carcass to the fields from where it had emerged.

Terrified by the incident, children ran towards the classrooms and locked themselves inside. When headmistress Nidhi Diwakar arrived at the school, the children told her about the incident. Diwakar soon alerted the forest department.

A field forest team led by forest inspector Ajmer Yadav visited the spot and took photographs of pugmarks.

“It was an adult leopard,” PTR deputy director Naveen Khandelwal told TOI. “I have directed Barahi range officer DK Goel to deploy a picket of armed forest personnel at the school from Thursday morning for the safety of the students and to monitor the movement of the leopard.”

Khandelwal, however, hoped that the leopard would retreat to the forest in a day or two.

Meanwhile, the children continued with their classes with no security around. Concerned over the children’s safety, the headmistress, who also happens to be the only government teacher at the school with the strength of 37 students, said, “A shiksha mitra posted here has been entrusted with the invigilation duty for the ongoing UP Board Examination. Besides, as the primary schools are not provided with a Class IV staffer, it will be very difficult for me to ensure students’ safety. Today, the children were lucky as a dog came in between them and the leopard.”

Pradhan Ranjit Singh, meanwhile, appealed to the villagers to accompany their children to the school in groups.

File photo of 2008 Malegaon blast

MUMBAI: A day after the Bombay high court commented on the slow pace of the 2008 Malegaon blast trial, the special trial court on Wednesday fined an accused, Sudhakar Chaturvedi, Rs 10,000 for filing an unnecessary application.

The court dubbed the plea to seek the station diaries—from the beginning to the end of the case—as a delaying tactic. Special judge Vinod S Padalkar said Chaturvedi must pay the fine in the next three days.

The accused, a 47-year-old Mirzapur-based social worker, is accused of being in contact with the key accused and believed to have arranged several meetings among them. The blast at Malegaon killed six persons and injured over a 100 on September 29, 2008.

Special public prosecutor Avinash Rasal had objected to Chaturvedi’s plea.

Rasal submitted that a similar plea made by another accused in the case was rejected by an earlier judge in 2016. He also cited Section 172 (3) of the Criminal Procedure Code. The section states neither the accused will be entitled to call for such diaries nor can he be entitled to see them merely because they are referred to by the court.

The court also rejected another of Chaturvedi’s pleas in which he had sought details of his alleged transit from Bhopal to Mumbai before his arrest. The accused has claimed that he was tortured by the ATS when brought to the city. Rasal had opposed this plea too and iterated that the details were not part of the chargsheet of either the ATS, the first agency to investigate the blast, or the NIA which took over the investigation later.

The court, though, allowed another plea by Chaturvedi seeking his narco-analysis and brain-mapping report. Rasal has submitted that the reports were not part of the chargesheet.

Rasal said the court also asked the defence lawyers to take note of the fact that no one was observing its order directing the accused to be present at least once a week. Among the other accused on trial are BJP’s Bhopal MP Pragya Thakur and Lt Col Prasad Purohit. Both are out on bail. So far, 140 witnesses have deposed.

NASHIK: The cyber police station ( Nashik rural) on Wednesday helped a man get back around Rs 91,000 of the Rs 1 lakh that he was duped of online.

The complainant, Kashinath Chavan, thanked the rural police for acting swiftly and helping him get his money back. According to police, Chavan, who works in an oil company in Manmad, got a call from the conman on Saturday.

“The caller introduced himself as the representative of an online payment wallet company and informed Chavan that he had won a prize. The conman then asked Chavan to click on a web link that was sent on the latter’s cellphone following which the prize money would be transferred,” a police officer said.

“Not finding anything fishy, Chavan clicked on the link. Minutes later he got a message that Rs 1 lakh had been deducted from his bank account. Chavan immediately realised that he was cheated and approached cyber police station to register a complaint,” he added.

Cyber police team led by police inspector Subhash Anmulwar took all technical information of the complainant’s account and sent notices to the nodal officers of a few online pay wallet companies.

Later, the nodal officers concerned were also informed that a person was cheated of Rs 1 lakh; hence, transaction of moving the money from one account to another should be immediately stopped. Eventually, police managed to get Rs 91,173 back in Chavan’s back account.

“People should not trust unidentified people calling to seek personal details. No bank that asks personal details over the phone. If people have any doubt regarding their bank accounts, they should visit the bank personally. At the same time, people should not click any link received on their cellphone which they are unaware of,” Anmulwar said,

“Still, if anyone gets cheated, they should immediately contact the nearest police station or cyber police station,” he added.

Representative image

HYDERABAD: The Telangana high court on Wednesday came down heavily on the state administration over 2,400 illegal religious structures at public places and asked the government if it has the wherewithal to take action.

Assailing authorities for turning a blind eye towards mushrooming of such structures, a bench of Chief Justice Raghavendra Singh Chauhan and Justice A Abhishek Reddy said the number must have gone up in last 10 years. “By 2010, number of illegal structures was 6,707, and 2,402 of them were illegally built religious structures. Let us start cleaning up the mess from the twin cities,” the bench said.

“Neither Constitution nor courts will offer any protection to such patently illegal structures,” the CJ said. Talking tough, HC sought to know from chief secretary Somesh Kumar whether government has any policy to deal with the issue without buckling under pressure from any quarter.

Referring to GO 262 (March 31, 2010) which had laid down guidelines to deal with illegal buildings, including unauthorised religious structures of different faiths, the bench sought to know from principal secretary, municipal administration, Arvind Kumar what the state intends to do.

Arvind Kumar explained that as per guidelines they have the mandate to bring down illegal religious structures raised recently. “In respect of slightly older structures, the guidelines say that they can be pulled down after taking the locals into confidence. There is a third category of very old religious structures. We propose to demolish them only after holding detailed discussions with stakeholders,” Arvind said.

Questioning the government on what it would do if the deliberations were to fail, the CJ asked: “Will the government shy away from implementing the law? Why don’t you (government) spell out your policy in a clear manner and send a strong message to society that illegal structures will not be tolerated even under the garb of religious freedom.”

The bench earlier rapped the state for its casual manner in which an incomplete affidavit was filed by the chief secretary (CS) regarding an illegal temple in Rock Garden layout at Madhavapuri Hills, Ameenpur. The bench, while hearing a PIL filed by Human Rights and Consumer Protection Cell Trust, had sought the affidavit from the CS. “We are rejecting this affidavit as it is vague and incomplete,” the CJ said, chastising the cops and revenue officials for not showing the will power to deal with the situation firmly.

Government pleader for revenue department CV Bhaskar Reddy withdrew the affidavit and promised to get a detailed affidavit soon. In line with an earlier directive, Arvind along with panchayat raj secretary Sandeep Kumar Sultania and Sangareddy collector M Hanumantha Rao were also present before the court.

The bench also found fault with the Ameenpur temple committee for failing to file its counter and rejected an attempt by advocate Umesh Chandra to implead devotees in the matter. It appointed advocate N Praveen Reddy as advocate commission to study the Ameenpur temple issue.

It sought a report by March 13. Hearing would resume in the matter on March 16.

On the other hand, UT chief conservator of forests (CCF) Debendra Dalai had written a letter to the director general of forests and special secretary, ministry of environment, forest and climate change, opposing the proposal.The letter sent by the ministry to the Punjab government stated, “As far as the views of this ministry are concerned, we had advised the Punjab government to consider extending the ESZ to at least 1 km and submit the revised proposal.” “In this background and keeping in view of the order of Supreme Court dated November 5, 2019, on the Tata Camelot project, it is requested to provide your specific comments on the issues raised by Chandigarh to expedite the process of publication of ESZ notification”.The administration has already notified leaving 2km to 2.75km radius around the sanctuary as ESZ. The ministry had also issued a final notification on an ESZ around the sanctuary for Chandigarh but Punjab and Haryana have so far not declared these zones in their jurisdictions. The UT is pushing for the two to leave a matching area from the lake boundary as restricted development zone.The UT, in a letter on January 14, stated, “The ESZ for the area around Sukhna Wildlife Sanctuary falling in Chandigarh has already been notified by the ministry on January 18, 2017, wherein the ESZ has been kept 2km to 2.75 km.

The letter further stated, “It is to reiterate that a similar proposal of the Punjab government sent to the government in 2015 was not accepted.

Vijayawada: The paddy fields in the 150-year-old Krishna delta have received a green cover for the first time in a decade with farmers cultivating the second crop.

Farmers in the Krishna delta, spread over Krishna, Guntur, Prakasam and West Godavari districts, are busy with Rabi crop thanks to incessant rains in the upstream and subsequent floods this monsoon. Out of the 13.08 lakh acres of cultivable land in Krishna delta, farmers have grown Rabi crop in 5,07,685 acres. “The Kharif crop was good due to availability of water and its judicious maintenance,” said M V S Nagi Reddy, vice-chairman, AP Agriculture Mission.

Compared with the 15.17 lakh acres in 2019, this year Rabi crop was cultivated in 19.15 lakh acres. “Farming in parts of Krishna and West Godavari districts had come down because of conversion of paddy fields into aqua farms. We are also focusing on aqua promotion and allow farmers to draw water for aqua farms from paddy fields. The used water from paddy fields is drawn for aqua cultivation,” Nagi Reddy added, claiming that better water management helped farmers in both ways.

“We were able to store some water in Pulichintala project last monsoon, besides giving water to the Nagarjuna Sagar right canal which covers parts of Guntur and Prakasam districts. This year, Rabi was cultivated in 45,000 acres in Prakasam district,” said the Agriculture Mission chairman.

He said aqua farms spread over 1.71 lakh acres in the Krishna delta benefited from release of water for Rabi. “Chief minister Jaganmohan Reddy is concerned about agriculture. The Agriculture Mission is very much helpful to the state agriculture sector in general and farmers in particular,” said Nagi Reddy, who is also a former member of Indian Council of Agriculture Research (ICAR).

294,['27/02/2020'],Collector tells Goa University to check deputy speaker’s son’s degree,"This story is from February 27, 2020

Representative Image

PANAJI: The North Goa collector has asked Goa University to ascertain the validity of the Bachelor of Arts (BA) degree submitted by deputy speaker Isidore Fernandes’s son Raymond while applying for the post of awal karkun.

Raymond’s degree is from Lucknow-based Bhartiya Shiksha Parishad, where he claims to have completed his BA in 2007.

Activist Aires Rodrigues had filed a complaint before chief secretary Parimal Rai seeking a probe into the selection process for the post of awal karkun by the North Goa collectorate.

“There is no inquiry. We are just following process and we have asked Goa University whether the University where the candidate studied is recognized or not,” additional collector Gopal Parsekar said.

Rodrigues’ complaint states that he had “enough reason to believe that the certificates of educational qualifications submitted by Raymond Fernandes are forged and fabricated.”

While calling for the inquiry into the authenticity of the certificates submitted by Raymond, Rodrigues also demanded that Goa Public Service Commission should evaluate the candidate’s abilities.

The activist said that according to the University Grants Commission (UGC), the Bhartiya Shiksha Parishad in Lucknow is unrecognised and functioning in violation of Section 2(f) and Section 3 of the UGC Act, 1956.

The advocate also alleged that revenue minister Jennifer Monseratte compelled authorities to leak the exam question paper to Raymond. “Raymond Fernandes was given prior access to the question paper of the written test held on January 18, this year, for the post of awal karkun,” Rodrigues said

NASHIK: The state transport department has assured the Nashik Municipal Corporation ( NMC ) full co-operation for the city bus service project that is expected to begin from April 1, 2020.

State transport minister Anil Parab informed civic chief Radhakrishna Game that the state transport department will give its nod to the civic body to start the city bus service project. As per norms, it is mandatory for any civic body to take permission of the state transport department for starting a bus service project.

On Wednesday, district guardian minister Chhagan Bhujbal chaired a meeting regarding the city bus service project with Parab and Game in Mumbai on Wednesday.

“The state transport minister has assured us that he will depute five senior officials from Maharashtra State Road Transport Corporation (MSRTC) to the NMC to assist the civic body in running the city bus service project without hiccup,” Game said.

“The minister has also assured that necessary permission from the state government to run the city bus service will be shortly given to the NMC. We have also demanded the transport minister to allow NMC to use the infrastructure of MSRTC for its city bus service project,” he added.

The civic chief also urged the transport minister to give the Anandnagar bus depot for the city bus service at nominal rate. “Moreover, we also urged the minister for joint use of four terminals of MSRTC — Nimani, Adgaon, Satpur and Nashik Road. The minister has given his nod for the purpose,” Game said.

The NMC has a plan to run 400 city buses — 200 CNG, 150 electric and 50 diesel — under the city bus project. All the 400 buses are to be operated and maintained by three private contractors. The NMC has already signed an agreement for 250 CNG and diesel buses, while it is yet to sign an agreement with the contractor for running the electric buses.

“We have urged the Centre to give us subsidy for buying 100 electric buses. We will run all 150 electric buses in phases if the Centre gives its nod to provide for subsidy,” Game said.

Madurai: Fisherfolk of Kanyakumari district unanimously showed a strong opposition to the draft National Marine Fisheries (Regulation and Management) Bill, 2019 at a public meeting organised by the district administration and fisheries department at the Kanyakumari district collectorate on Wednesday. Tense moments prevailed as the participants, including women, resorted to sloganeering to drop the bill as it will affect their livelihood.

The participants engaged in a heated argument with the officials and the situation was brought under control after district collector Prashant M Wadnere gave the participants an option to peacefully raise their issues of concern so that it can be forwarded to the ministry concerned.

Fisherfolk and the representatives of fishermen bodies such as South Asian Fishermen Fraternity (SAFF), International Fishermen Development Trust (INFIDET), mechanised boats and country craft fishermen unions and Neithal Makkal Iyakkam have highlighted various aspects of the draft that will affect the livelihood of the coastal people. INFIDET president Justin Antony said that it has sent shock waves among the fishermen as they will have to obtain permission from regulatory officials on a daily-basis even for fishing within a miniscule range of 12 nautical miles from the shore. “For deep sea fishermen from this region it takes 20 to 45 days for a fishing expedition. How can they get daily permits?” he questioned.

Calling the act practically impossible, he said that the existing practices are already stringent enough to monitor the fishermen.

Bareilly: Former Uttar Pradesh governor Aziz Qureshi has been booked for what UP police said a “provocative” speech delivered during an anti-CAA protest meeting in Moradabad on February 22. “After verification of video recording, it has been found that the former governor indeed delivered a provocative speech. So, an FIR has been registered against him,” said Moradabad’s superintendent of police (SP) Amit Kumar Anand.

The SP said that Qureshi reached Eidgah ground in Moradabad, where a sit-in protest was being held since January 29, and “stoked sentiments” of the protestors with his speech.

The police officer said that the FIR was filed under IPC sections 143 (punishment for unlawful assembly), 145 (joining unlawful assembly), 149 (every member of unlawful assembly guilty of offence committed in prosecution of common object) and 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant) at Gulshaheed police station on Teusday.

Qureshi-- now chairman of Madhya Pradesh Urdu Academy-- reached Moradabad to extend his support to the protestors.

He could be purportedly heard in the video clip saying, “Our Constitution guarantees social, economic and political justice to each and everybody irrespective of any caste and creed of the nation.

“They have killed the spirit of the Constitution and insulted the people who had drafted it. Why did they do it? Amit Shah and Narendra Modi have one aim to achieve, and that is to turn this country into a Hindu nation. And to achieve this goal, they are using every possible way from abusing Pakistan to carrying out air-strike and frightening people in the name of Pakistan.

“All they are doing is to divide the nation on communal lines. And it is the first step to show that by introducing a law they have sidelined 20crore population of Muslims in the country,” Qureshi said.

The flyover will be built near the Mico circle on Trimbak Road in the city

NASHIK: A new flyover is set to come up at the busy Trimbak Road as the Nashik Municipal Corporation (NMC) is expected to start the construction work soon.

The flyover will be built near the Mico circle on Trimbak Road in the city.

The civic administration has increased the financial provision for the flyover project from Rs 15 crore to Rs 40 crore as the project will now be extended beyond two traffic signals — Hotel Green view and Hotel Sibal — on the said stretch.

The project was, in fact, proposed in the last year’s budget with the provision of Rs 15 crore; however, it did not start.

NMC officials said that the work was delayed as the Nashik Metro corridor was supposed to pass through the same stretch and the Maharashtra Metro Rail Corporation Limited had sought the flyover plan from municipal corporation.

According to NMC sources, the metro corridor would be constructed over the flyover.

“Maha Metro had sought information about the NMC’s proposed flyover on Mico circle along with its height. We have given all the details to the Maha Metro which includes the plan to construct the corridor for Nashik Metro project. This corridor is to be constructed above the NMC’s flyover,” a senior Public Works Department official said.

“The proposed corridor of Nashik Metro had delayed the work of flyover on Mico Circle. Now, we have also planned to extend the length of the flyover up to the second traffic junction from Mico Circle on Trimbak Road,” said an NMC official.

Maha Metro has proposed to build Nashik Metro project at the cost of Rs 2,100 crore. The state cabinet has already given approval to the detailed project report which has been sent to the Centre for approval.

The rubber tyre-based coaches have been planned under the Nashik Metro project and two elevated corridors with total length of 32 kms have been proposed in the city.

The first corridor will be from Gangapur to Mumbai Naka with total length of 10 km. It will include 10 stations —Gangapur, Jalapur, Ganpat Nagar, Kale Nagar, Jehan Circle, Thatte Nagar, Shivaji Nagar, Panchavati, CBS and Mumbai Naka.

The second corridor will pass via the Mico Circle. The second corridor will connect Gangapur to Nashik Road via Mico Circle, having total length of 22 km. It will include 15 stations — Dhruv Nagar, Shramik Nagar, Mahindra, Shaneshwar Nagar, Satpur Colony, MIDC, ABB Circle, Parijat Nagar, MICO circle, CBS, Sharda Circle, Dwarka Circle, Gayatri Nagar, Samta Nagar, Gandhi Nagar, Nehru Nagar, Datta Mandir and Nashik Road.

A neighbourhood in Sunnambu Kolathur off Pallavaram-Thoraipakkam radial road that was flooded during the 2017 ... Read More

CHENNAI: Residents living in low-lying areas off Pallavaram-Thoraipakkam radial road between Keelkattalai lake and Narayanapuram lake are hopeful that authorities will honour their promise of building a retaining wall along the stretch to prevent flooding in the area.

The public works department (PWD) has begun work on the project from Narayanapuram lake. On Sunday, PWD officials addressed the residents of Sunnambu Kolathur and explained the technical details of the project and assured them of bringing a comprehensive flood mitigation plan for the neighbourhood.

“For three continuous years since 2015, we were affected by floods. The water from Keelkattalai lake passes through the surplus canal and excess water from the canal floods the neighbourhood. Even last year when there was less rain, the canal was brimming,” said J Sankar, a resident who has been petitioning the authorities seeking action.

More than 1,000 families reside in Sunnambu Kolathur, according to the Federation of Sunnambu Kolathur Residents Welfare Association.

Apart from explaining about the project, PWD officials promised the public that necessary action will be taken to stop sewage being let out into the surplus canal, according to residents who were part of the meeting. “We will not allow even an inch of encroachment,” a PWD official said, adding that a comprehensive flood mitigation plan for the area will be announced soon by the chief minister to construct a retaining wall up to Keelkattalai lake.

Officials said the initial stretch from Narayanapuram lake till a few hundred metres from the water body is expected to be completed by June.

“Constructing a house in floodplains or a low-lying area is not a public mistake. It is the collective responsibility of all departments and now we have to find a solution,” the PWD official said.

Apart from surplus water from the canal, another issue faced by the residents is encroachments which too was addressed recently.

Two months ago, revenue department officials too had surveyed encroachments after complaints from residents that ingress and egress from the residential areas to the radial road has been cut off due to the encroachments. “In 2015, people had to jump walls to get to the 200-feet road to get relief materials,” recalled a resident of Raja Nagar.

AURANGABAD: Ravinder Kumar Singal, the Aurangabad range special inspector general of police (IGP), has ordered a high-level inquiry against Jalna police’s anti-dacoity squad (ADS) and officers of Kadim Jalna police station for allegedly framing a man in a case of ‘preparing for a dacoity’.

The alleged framing of the man — a commerce graduate holding a diploma in education veterinary science — resulted in him being taken on remand by the police of three different districts, Aurangabad rural, Osmanabad and Ahmednagar, to investigate house break-in and theft cases.

After staying behind bars between January 3 and February 14, the man reached out to the range IGP and lodged a complaint against the police.

When contacted, Singal said, “Allegations of framing an innocent man are very serious and we have ordered an inquiry into it by a young IPS officer. We cannot let men in uniform ruin lives of innocent people. Those found guilty will face stringent action.”

As per a complaint submitted by Anil Goraknath Walekar, a vehicle belonging to one of his relatives was stolen and the family had lodged a complaint at Kadim Jalna police station in September 2019.

One of Walekar’s friend promised to help him find the vehicle and in return, asked for a party at a dhaba. On January 3, when Walekar and two of his friends were eating at the Shivneri dhaba on Rajur road, they were joined by two policemen from the Kadim Jalna police station.

After having food and liquor together, the policemen took the trio to the police station. While one of the men was released, the remaining two, including Walekar, were handed over to the ADS team that took them to the office of the Jalna superintendent of police.

The ADS then registered an offence stating that in the wee hours of January 4, their patrolling team spotted a group of armed suspects near the Global Gurukul School in Jalna and arrested four of them with sharp weapons and articles required for committing dacoities.

After getting bail, Walekar filed an RTI seeking CCTV footage of the Kadim Jalna police station as well as of the Jalna SP office, but his plea was turned down citing security reasons.

The man then reached the dhaba where he and his friends had food and liquor with the policemen before being detained.

He managed to obtain the CCTV footage from that place. Using this footage, he reached out to the Jalna police to lodge a complaint, but no complaint was registered. Eventually, he went to Singal who the ordered a probe.

On Wednesday, a team led by assistant superintendent of police Gorakh Bhamre reached Jalna and initiated the investigation against the police officers and their subordinates in the ADS and Kadim Jalna police station.

Satish Chavan

AURANGABAD: Council member Satish Chavan demanded the urban development minister to establish a separate municipal council for Satara Deolai villages, which were merged with the Aurangabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) in 2016.

This was done so that these areas get government funds for development.

Raising the issue in the legislative council on Wednesday, Chavan and other MLCs from the region said in 2016 when Satara-Deolai had a population of 1 lakh, the government had granted these villages municipal council status. Soon, the government merged these villages with the civic body of Aurangabad city and had turned them into two wards.

The elections conducted and corporators were also elected. Chavan said that no big development works were carried out in these two villages and no facilities were provided. The area lacks roads, drainage, drinking water and other civic amenities. He demanded separate municipal corporation for the two villages so that the residents could avail various facilities. The government would also provide financial support to the council for development works.

In his reply, the urban development minister Eknath Shinde for now ruled out any such possibility, but said that provisions would be made for the area for development. A meeting of officials and the guardian minister will be convened on the issue to ensure the newly included civic body areas are developed properly, he said. Shinde added that so far 42 different development works were being carried out in Satara Deolai at a cost of Rs 1.98 crore.

JODHPUR: In a major relief to the exercise of panchayat election and lotteries for the reserved categories on the posts of ward panch, sarpanch , member panchayat samiti, member zila parishad and pradhan, the Rajasthan High Court here on Wednesday dismissed all applications challenging the process.

With all the petitions dismissed, the state government and the state election commission would now be able to proceed with their respective exercises for the fourth phase of panchayat elections as directed by the Supreme Court in an earlier order. The apex court had directed that the elections be held in second half of April.

The single bench of justice Arun Bhansali stated, “Order passed by the State Election Commission dated 9/1/2020 and order passed by the state dated 24/1/2020 and subsequent orders thereto do no call for any interference.” The court rejected the individual challenges raised against the draw of lotteries for lack of any substance.

Petitioners Vijay Singh and others challenged the initiation of lottery schedule in the state, a 3-day exercise started from January 31, ordered by the government on January 24, for the purpose of determination of reservation of various posts ahead of the panchayat election. The petition stated, “The election process initiated by the Election Commission pursuant to the notification dated December 26, 2019 is still in progress and has only been deferred by order dated January 9, 2020. Since no specific order has been passed by the EC in this regard, the move of the government for drawing of lottery for purpose of reservation etc. is premature and the same cannot be countenanced.”

Petitioner’s counsel Moti Singh argued in the court that the said order with pending election process, which has only been deferred, was interference in the process, hence could not be permitted.

306,['27/02/2020'],Fire NOC must for registering PGs in Chandigarh: Governor V P Singh Badnore,"V P Singh Badnore

TimesView Making a no-objection certificate from the fire department mandatory for registration of any paying guest (PG) accommodation in the city and amending the policy by incorporating clauses like annual building inspection and registration are all steps in the right direction. Unfortunately, all these measures only apply if a guest facility is registered. The latest fire accident has already brought to light the ground reality that only a minuscule percentage of such facilities are registered. The first step towards addressing the issue would be to ensure registration. The RWAs could play a key role in this by identifying the illegal set-ups in their area.

‘Not a single PG sealed in city’

CHANDIGARH: Punjab governor-cum-UT administrator V P Singh Badnore on Wednesday issued directions to make no objection certificate (NOC) from the fire department mandatory before registering paying guest (PG) accommodations in the city.Badnore, who was holding a meeting of senior UT officials, expressed concern over the loss of three lives in the recent fire incident in Sector 32, and directed officials to ensure regular police inspection of PGs.The administration, meanwhile, has started the process to revise its PG policy. The UT is planning to include important points like annual inspection of building and annual registration and scrap one-time registration.A special desk has already been formed in the estate office for the registration of PGs, a senior UT official said. “Assistant estate officer will look after it,” deputy commissioner Mandip Singh Brar said.On Wednesday, the UT estate office came out with a fresh proforma for the registration of PGs in Chandigarh , in which occupancy certificate of the building was made mandatory.The occupancy certificate, issued by the estate office, shows that the building has been made as per permissible building bylaws of the administration. Besides, the building owner, while applying for registration, must submit additional details like floor wise capacity for paying guests, and total accommodation available in the building. The estate office also released the list of 23 registered PGs in Chandigarh, which includes seven in Sector 35, four in Sector 36, three in Sector 15, two in Sector 21 and one each in sectors 11, 22, 27, 28, 34, 37 and 40.With the 2013 amendment in the Chandigarh building bylaws allowing even 7.5 marla houses to keep PGs — earlier only 10 marlas and above could offer their place — this business is booming in the city.

307,['27/02/2020'],Notices served to 92 industrial units for air pollution,"This story is from February 27, 2020

Representative image

NASHIK: The Maharashtra Pollution Control Board ( MPCB ) recently served notices to 92 industrial units of the Ambad and Satpur industrial estates to pay fines for causing air pollution since 2015.

The Satpur and Ambad industrial estates of the Maharashtra Industrial Development Corporation (MIDC) are located in the jurisdiction of the Nashik Municipal Corporation (NMC).

MPCB sources said 87 small industrial units, three medium-scale units and two large industrial units have got the notices. A penalty of Rs 25 lakh is to be recovered from small industrial units, Rs 50 from medium and Rs 1 crore from the large industrial units. Cumulatively, fine of Rs 25.25 crore is expected to be recovered.

Nashik Industries and Manufacturers’ Association (Nima) has alleged that the MPCB has taken wrong decisions hurriedly under pressure. “The MPCB should have sent show-cause notices informing the industries about the air pollution caused by them. However, it hurriedly sent notices seeking penalties. This is wrong,” said Tushar Chavan, the Nima secretary.

“How will the industrial units pay such heavy penalties to the MPCB. Such actions will affect the industrial growth of the district. We are also seeking legal opinion on the issue” he added.

Chavan said that the Nima had recently called a meeting of all the 92 industrial units in the Nima office. “We have asked all the industries to submit their reply to the notice so that there will not be any legal hurdle in future. Moreover, we have also decided to move the court on the issue against the MPCB decision,” he added.

Chavan also alleged that the MPCB has sent notices hurriedly to the industrial units that are green and have not sent notices to those that are actually causing air pollution.

Jaipur: A 45-year-old man in Nagaur killed his parents in the early hours of Wednesday only to die in a road accident just an hour later.

According to initial probe, the man was unemployed and under financial crunch because of which he took this step. The deceased were identified as Ruga Ram and Patasi Devi, both in their 80s, and their son Hanuman Singh. The incident is of Bhadana village in Sadar police station area.

Mukul Sharma, circle officer, Nagaur, told TOI, “An accident was reported early on Wednesday and when we identified the victim as Hanuman Singh, it led us to the double murder of his parents who he allegedly killed with the wooden handle of an axe by striking them on the head.”

Following this, the accused left on his bike and was hit by a heavy vehicle due to which he died on the spot, the official said. “It is still unclear if it was accident or suicide as it appears that Hanuman came in the middle of the road and was hit by the heavy vehicle. We are looking for the vehicle to confirm our theory that the accused panicked after killing his parents and possibly committed suicide, though it cannot be said with certainty as of now,” Sharma added. The motive behind the murder is also unclear.

Representative image

AURANGABAD: Railway activists and passengers have demanded a double line between Parbhani-Manmad via Aurangabad , as the South Central Railway (SCR) has completed the final phase of the double line between Mudkhed – Parbhani.

The survey for the proposed double-line between Parbhani and Manmad has been already completed in the first half of 2017, but the infrastructural work found no mention in the past budgets, including the latest railway budget.

While the doubling of the Daund-Manmad line was approved by the railway board around three years ago, the proposed doubling work between Parbhani and Manmad, of nearly 290km, was not granted.

Railway activist Omprakash Varma said, “It is an important route which witnesses running of several major long-distance trains. The railway authorities should lay the double-line on the desired route without wasting time,” he said.

Another railway activist Raj Somani, “The doubling of the line would help in reducing the travel time. It would increase the movement of passengers and goods,” he said.

When contacted, a senior SCR official, preferring anonymity, said the necessary survey work for doubling the line between Parbhani and Manmad railway was already done. “The survey report is being put up before the railway board for a necessary policy decision. The line-doubling on Parbhani and Manmad route is essential and it will be accomplished by completing necessary formalities,” he said.

Public relations officer of SCR (Nanded division), Rajesh Shinde said. “Three major junctions fall on Mudkhed-Parbhani track. Earlier, certain trains witnessed crossing delays, but the track-doubling will address the issue,”

The Mudkhed – Parbhani double line project with a distance of 81.43 km was sanctioned in 2012-13 with an estimated cost of Rs. 390 Crore. As per the plan charted out by the SCR, the crucial project was executed in five phases.

Madurai: “It is good to be out of the ship at last,” said a relieved Indian crew member after emerging from the quarantined cruise ship Diamond Princess at Yokohama in Japan on Wednesday. About 120 crew members from India had disembarked from the ship on Wednesday evening after weeks of confinement in the ship after hundreds of passengers and crew on board were infected by COVID-19 early this month.

After disembarking, they were taken by road in four buses from Yokohama port to Haneda airport, from where they were flown to Delhi in a chartered Air India flight. They will be under mandatory quarantine for 14 days in India before they are sent to their homes.

The nearly 3,700 crew and passengers who were on board when the ship was quarantined included 138 Indians – 132 crew members and six passengers. In all, 16 Indians tested positive for COVID-19 and were disembarked from the ship for treatment.

Among the Indian crew who disembarked on Wednesday were five from Tamil Nadu – Anbalagan of Madurai, Muthu of Trichy, Daniel of Chengalpattu, Dhamodharan of Tuticorin and Jayaraj of Coimbatore.

“We were waiting for the captain’s announcement even before dawn on Wednesday. Finally, at around around 3pm, the announcement came. While we were earlier told that we will have to undergo basic checkup for symptoms of cold, cough or fever, we did not have such hassles while disembarking,” Anbalagan told TOI.

He added that they will be under mandatory quarantine for 14 days in the National Security Guard (NSG) camp at Manesar in Gurgaon district, Haryana. “We are happy to return to India. Our company has assured to take care of us during the quarantine period,” he added.

The crew members said that Japanese defence personnel and officials from the Indian embassy in Japan were present during the disembarkation process. “They maintained safe distance from us and checked our passports,” said a crew.

Wearing masks, the relieved crew were glued to their mobile phones, informing their family and friends about their return. The crew members hoped that Diamond Princess will be disinfected and wished to get back to work soon.

MADURAI: While traditional snack items like murukku, kadalai mittai, karachevu and the Geographical Indication (GI) tagged Srivilliputtur palkova have frequently been exported due to their high demand in other countries, it is the first time that Madurai ’s famous drink jigarthanda has been flown to Singapore by an Air India flight on Wednesday.

S Thanga Pandian , customs clearance agent, said that traditional Indian sweets were in high demand in other countries and over the past few months, he had seen the exports of not less than 1,000 kg of traditional sweets and snacks being flown from the Madurai airport to various destinations.

The makers of the famous jigarthanda recently received a request from a local trader in Singapore for their jigarthanda. After completion of all formalities, including the FSSAI certification, the first consignment of 135 kg was flown to Singapore on a trial basis on Wednesday.

Pandian said that all the ingredients for jigarthanda including the milk, almond gum, sea algae, sugar and the ice cream for the constitution of the drink were being taken from Madurai. “It is the taste of cow’s milk and the handmade ice cream from Madurai that gives the specific taste to the drink, hence all the ingredients have to be taken from here, only the algae is taken in the dry form and will be soaked once it reaches its destination,” he said. As the fasting season of Ramzan is coming up, jigarthanda is expected to be in demand in Singapore as it is an energizer and also has cooling properties. Pandian said that based on the reception that the drink receives in Singapore, the frequency of export may be enhanced to even daily.

321,['27/02/2020'],West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee to call on Naveen Patnaik before zonal council meet tomorrow,"This story is from February 27, 2020

Mamata Banerjee

BHUBANESWAR: West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee will call on her Odisha counterpart Naveen Patnaik at his residence here on Friday before the two attend the Eastern Zonal Council meeting to be chaired by Union home minister Amit Shah. Chief ministers of Bihar and Jharkhand, Nitish Kumar and Hemant Soren , are also scheduled to attend the meeting to be held later on the day.

This will be the first time Mamata will meet Shah after the enactment of the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), one which the Trinamool Congress leader is opposed to, and Naveen supports.

“Mamata will pay Naveen a courtesy visit. There is no fixed agenda in the one-on-one meeting,” sources in the chief minister’s office said even as speculation is rife on what the two leaders would probably discuss.

Sources said the current political situation in the wake of violence in New Delhi over the citizenship act may figure in the brief meeting between the two regional leaders at Naveen Niwas. The same day, Shah is scheduled to address a pro-CAA rally at Janata Maidan in the city.

While Mamata has been a bitter critic of CAA, Naveen has come out in its support. This is not the only aspect on which the two chief ministers differ. While Mamata has vehemently opposed many initiatives of the Narendra Modi government at the Centre, Naveen has been quite the opposite.

In February last year, amid Mamata’s stir against the CBI-West Bengal police row over chit fund probe, Mamata had tried to garner Naveen’s support. But the Odisha chief minister had distanced himself. He was also cold to Mamata’s overtures to enlist his support for a regional front to take on the BJP at the Centre ahead of the 2019 Lok Sabha elections.

The West Bengal chief minister, who landed here on a four-day visit on Tuesday night and headed to Puri, paid obeisance at the 12th century Jagannath temple on Wednesday. Responding to a media query on the violence in New Delhi, Mamata said, “We don’t want blood, we want peace.

Representative image

AURANGABAD: Students from Swami Ramanand Teerth Marathwada University (SRTMU) are opposing changes in the examination schedule that make the students appear for two papers on the same day.

Maharashtra higher and technical education minister Uday Samant discussed the changes concerned with SRTMU vice-chancellor Udhav Bhosle in Mumbai on Wednesday.

The changes in contention have been introduced for degree-level last semester examination. A student said it was a regressive step taken by SRTMU to conduct two examinations on the same day.

“The current examination schedule offers inadequate time to prepare for subjects. The university has taken the decision eyeing its own convenience of wrapping up the examination early,” he said.

Sharad Deshmukh, Nanded district president of National Students Union of India (NSUI), said, “Several leading universities have been taking measures to reduce the stress associated with the examinations, SRTMU is perhaps the only varsity which is going in the exact opposite direction. It is practically impossible for students to prepare for two examinations on a single day. The changes in the examination system have been causing huge mental stress to students.”

When contacted, Ashok Kadam, public relations officer of SRTM University , said changes in the examination schedule were introduced by considering the interests of students.

“The protracted schedule of examinations causes unnecessary stress among students and therefore VC decided to shrink the schedule. The shorter period of examination will also result in early declaration of results,” he said.

According to sources, Samant has asked SRTMU to reconsider the changes in the examination schedule. “The minister reportedly told the VC to ensure student-centric functioning. It is unclear whether the decision will be rolled back,” a senior university faculty said.

The turtles were rescued and released into sea by police officials

MADURAI: Police personnel from the Marine police and Q Branch in Ramanathapuram district rescued two turtles caught in a fishing net on Wednesday evening. The five-member team comprising Q branch sub-inspector Mustafa and Marine police inspector S Kanagaraj were on duty at Arichal Munai near Dhanushkodi when they spotted the turtles and rescued them as the fishermen were reluctant in freeing them.

The stretch from Rameswaram to Dhanushkodi is a turtle nesting zone where the forest department collects thousands of eggs during the nesting season.

“As it is the annual nesting season now, turtles frequent the stretch and at times get caught in fishing nets,” the inspector said. Since turtle hunting is banned under The Wildlife Protection Act, 1972 , the species is mostly released.

Interestingly, this is also the season when fishermen engaged in shore fishing get a good catch, due to which they catch fish two to three times a day, against the usual practice of once a day. In this fishing model the net is spread for 1.5 to 2km stretch and a group of fishermen draw the net from either side from the shore.

On Wednesday evening, the police personnel spotted two turtles caught in the net each weighing about 25kg and 20kg.

As fishermen were reluctant in rescuing them, the police personnel made them release the turtles. While one returned to the sea, the other was injured due to mishandling by a fisherman.

The turtle that was motionless after the hard landing was comforted by the police personnel and it started moving its limbs after 10 minutes.

It was released in the sea. Marine police personnel said that earlier this month they released five turtles caught in a fishing net at Dhanushkodi.

They appealed to the fishermen to ensure that turtles are neither caught nor injured when they are fishing.

326,['27/02/2020'],When rainwater quenched thirst,"This story is from February 27, 2020

Jaipur: When there were no pipelines, rainwater harvesting helped quench heritage city’s thirst.

At Nahargarh and Jaigarh forts, rainwater harvesting structures dates back to the 18th century.

An elaborate network of channels and aquaducts were built by Sawai Jai Singh, the founder of of modern Jaipur.

The gradient of the hill was used to channel the flow of water through ducts to a portion of the hill that was carved out to form a tank. As the water entered the tank, an elaborate swirling mechanism ensured that the gush of water could be regulated and that the structure did not suffer damage in case the flow was excessive.

At Nahargarh, water harvesting structures preceded the construction of the fort in 1734.

Neeraj Doshi, an organiser of the heritage water walks, while giving details about the old water structures of the city said, “The technology used then was to preserve as much water possible and prevent it from flowing down the hills. There are three tanks at Nahargahr and five at Jaigarh. The Nahargarh tanks could store around 6 crore litres of water. At Jaigarh, the only open tank stores around 2.5 crore litres of water. The structures are still working except a few damages on the route.”

The water collected at the forts was utilised over there, but there are ruins of a tunnel coming down the hill of Nahargarh fort to Talkatora pond. It is presumed that this tunnel was used to transfer water to Talkatora in case of overflow, which gushed into Mansagar Lake. Talkatora was filled by water received through a canal passing through the city from Dravyawati river which also flows to Mansagar lake.

“The system of Jaipur was advanced enough to provide water to royals and the residents. Choti Chaupar and Badi Chaupar used to have water tanks from where water was taken by the common people. The idea was to make water available at the centre of the city. With change of time, taps were introduced by Samuel Swinton Jacob, an English engineer, after 1880. He installed taps on many intersections of the Walled City to reach out to common people,” explained Neeraj.

The structures built at Nahargarh still store water, but it is not used. At Jaigarh though, water is utilised by the people living within the fort except for bathing and drinking.

MADURAI: Two tourists from the United Kingdom and the US took out a swimming expedition across the Palk Bay from Talaimannar in Sri Lanka to Arichal Munai near Dhanushkodi in Ramanathapuram district on Wednesday. The swimmers were escorted by the Indian Coast Guard (ICG) from the International Maritime Boundary Line (IMBL) and stopped at the first island near Arichal Munai.

Adam A G Moss from the UK and Eddie Al-Ming Hu from the US got clearance from the ministry of external affairs on Monday, following which information on the same was shared with the ICG at Mandapam in Ramanathapuram district. “They were supposed to take up the expedition on Tuesday but the plan was dropped as the sea was rough,” ICG Mandapam commandant G Mani Kumar said.

They set off from Talaimannar at 5am on Wednesday and crossed the IMBL that is 6 nautical miles (11km) from Arichal Munai and entered the Indian waters at 12.05pm. The duo was accompanied by a support team in a boat. ICG’s ship and two smaller vessels also accompanied them for search and rescue operations in case of emergency.

Police sources said the support boat from Sri Lanka that accompanied the tourists was stopped at 4 nautical miles (7.4km) off Arichal Munai. The swimmers were allowed to proceed up to the first island -- about 2km off Arichal Munai -- as they are not permitted to proceed further.

On reaching Arichal Munai at 4.15pm the swimmers and the support team was questioned and checked by the marine police and Q branch personnel to check if those who accompanied the tourists were not involved in any other activities. The tourists then started back by boat and were monitored by the ICG till the boat crossed the IMBL at 5.40pm and entered the Sri Lankan waters.

Jaipur: A fact-finding committee constituted by deputy chief minister Sachin Pilot to look into the incident of two Dalit cousins being beaten up and humiliated in Nagaur on February 16, submitted its seal-packed report.

The report is confidential, but sources in the Congress claimed that the fact-finding team had found lapses on part of police in handling the case. “The fact-finding team was not satisfied with police action taken in the issue,” he said.

The police department has already sent station house officer (Panchaudi) Rajpal Singh to reserve police lines, Nagaur. Shambhu Dayal Meena has replaced him.

Pilot, while informing reporters that he had received the report from the committee, said the report will be sent to All India Congress Committee and in-charge general secretary of the state. “The incident is shameful.

MADURAI: A new state-of-the-art burns ward, which was proposed to be built at the Government Rajaji Hospital (GRH) in Madurai at a cost of Rs 6 crore, is yet to be inaugurated.

According to sources, construction of the building is complete but it is yet to be equipped and opened for use.

Dean of the GRH, Dr Sangumani J asserted that the new ward would be fully ready within the next two weeks.

The proposal for the new ward had come in 2018 after the current 20-bedded burns ward was found to have flaws and was found insufficient to handle victims with burn injuries in the aftermath of the forest fire at Kurangini in Theni, which left 23 dead.

“The building is fully complete. However, the necessary equipment is yet to be acquired. Within two weeks, we are hoping to get it. Soon after it is done, we want to equip and open the ward as soon as possible,” said Sangumani, speaking to TOI.

However, hospital sources said the building was completed almost two months ago but was just kept locked up.

“We were expecting it to be equipped soon and opened but it did not happen. We suspected administrative delays,” said a source.

The building of the new burns ward is located close to the ophthalmology section and old nephrology department near the hospital’s compound wall.

The ward, as proposed, is set to be equipped with state-of-the-art equipment and facilities to provide specialized care for patients with burn injuries. The unit is set to have water beds and kept fully-sterile fitted with hepa filters.

The facility would be centrally air-conditioned and there would also be an upgraded laboratory to treat patients better.

In a similar case, a new separate clinic for transgender people has been built and kept ready but is yet to be officially inaugurated.

BHUBANESWAR: Unidentified miscreants decamped with gold jewellery, cash and other articles worth nearly Rs 40 lakh from a bank official’s flat located in the busy Raghunathpur area, when the residents were away in the early hours of Wednesday.

The 45-year-owner, Pushkar Thakur , said, “My parents have been staying in the Raghunathpur flat since seven years. But it was empty for the last few days as they were staying in my flat in Bhubaneswar itself (from February 21). On Wednesday morning, we received information about the loot in that flat.”

In his complaint with the Nandankanan police station, Thakur alleged that nearly 100gm of gold jewellery, Rs 1.5 lakh in cash, some Australian dollars and other articles were stolen from the house.

“We are in shock. The apartment has a private security guard and a well-protected surveillance system. However, I came to know on Wednesday that the CCTV cameras were not functioning,” Thakur said.

Acting on Thakur’s complaint, police questioned the security guard and the maid of the house.

“We strongly suspect the involvement of someone close to the victim who may have passed on information to the burglars. We could have gotten vital leads on the robbery had the CCTV cameras been working,” a police officer said.

The flat is located on the third floor of a four-storeyed apartment in the area. “We didn’t have the slightest clue of the loot next door. Though the robbers broke the steel lock of the flat, we could not hear a noise as it was raining heavily that night,” a neighbour residing on the same floor said.

The security guard and society members of the apartment were unavailable for a comment.

It must be mentioned that in February last year, a gang of around 10 masked men broke into a house in Kanan Vihar area, hold a baby at knife-point and looted items worth Rs 10 lakh.

333,['27/02/2020'],Narmada canal breathes life into sandy Sanchore,"This story is from February 27, 2020

Jodhpur: The sandy landscapes of Sanchore in Jalore district have witnessed an impressive change after water from Narmada canal gave the entire region a lush green look.

One is greeted with hundreds of green and poly-houses in the agriculture fields when entering the limits of Sanchore subdivision. The land here is now producing fruits and crops – something that the local farmers had never believed would be possible.

The farmers of Sanchore are now cultivating pomegranates, which are being supplied to almost entire country. Orchards of fruits like papaya, dates and other have become a common sight in the once-barren lands.

Talking about this transformation, Mahaveer Singh Dantiya, a farmer-turned-politican said that there was a time when even drinking water was a luxury. “However, arrival of Narmada water has changed the lives of people. Not only has the drinking water problem been resolved, but adequate water is now available for irrigation. This has changed the character of agriculture here,” said Dantiya.

He said now not only groundwater has risen remarkably, but the salinity of water has also disappeared.

Entire agriculture was dependent on rain here before 2008 and the farming average was very low. The area receives 370 mm rainfall on an average and traditionally, millet and gaur were the predominant crops.

“Now the farmers are harvesting three crops a year. Crops like cumin seed, fennel seeds, pearl millet and caster seeds are very common here,” said a progressive farmer of the region, Yogesh Joshi.

He said that nobody had ever dreamt of harvesting vegetables and fruits in the region but all types of agriculture is being practiced in the region with advanced farming technologies being adopted by the farmers.

According to agriculture observer Devendra Singh, the major crop now is jeera, which is sown in 30,000 hectares followed by isabgol. The production of jeera, which requires sweet water and was never grown in the region pre-canal era, grows about 10 quintals per hectare. Pomegranate is sown in 1,000 hectares.

The 74-km canal has nine major tributaries to carry the water of the main canal in different directions as far as upto Gudamalani in Barmer.

“There are 2,200 diggies built on these tributaries to hold the water of the canal for irrigation,” said Dantiya, adding that a huge network of sprinklers in the agriculture farms is in itself define the opulence of agriculture here.

According to the agriculture department, total area sown in the region was 60,383 hectares in 2008-09 and today, almost a decade after water reached Sanchore, it has risen to 1,63,000 hectares. It serves an area of 1,477 square kilometre and provides drinking water to 874 villages.

In recent years, the agricultural transformation has caught the fancy of investors from neighbouring Gujarat, who have set up processing and packaging plants in Sanchore, further improving the economy of the area and generating employment.

“You ride along the highways and will come across many packaging units engaged in packaging of fruits and vegetables,” said Devesh Vyas, an advocate, adding that hardly any affluent person in Sanchore can be found who does not own an orchard.

CHANDIGARH: What do coaching classes tutors, frequent discotheque visitors and regular jagrata participants have in common? They are part of a new group of patients reporting to PGI with voice-related complaints, according to doctors. And, it is the background noise that is affecting voice in many cases.“When the background noise is above 90 decibels, one tends to raise voice. This causes trauma to the vocal cord. Consequently, one keeps on continuously talking loudly. Sometimes a single exposure can also cause damage,” said Dr Sanjay Munjal of department of ENT at PGI.“Long-term effect can make the voice turn hoarse. Usually, the effects are temporary and can be reversed with voice rest. If the voice is raised frequently, it can have permanent changes. For instance, in case of hoarse voice, the loudness of the voice can be reduced. Voice trauma can be treated with proper hydration, speaking for short duration and restricting voice usage,” said Dr Munjal. “Perhaps, tutors in coaching classes are teaching for a longer duration and larger groups. At discotheques, noise levels are already high,” he said.It was observed that doctors and other paramedical students who attended the annual festival of Association of Resident Doctors at PGI — Spring Festival — used to come back with hoarse voice. “So, we decided to conduct a study how loud noise in the background affects voice,” said Dr Anuradha Sharma, speech therapist faculty member at the ENT department in PGI.Both the noise levels in the background and voice changes in students owing to howling and shouting during the festival were measured. “We found that out of 25 students, 50% had hoarse voice, while three developed nodules, which if not treated, needs surgery for removal. The age group was from 18-25 years of age and all were women,” said Dr Sharma.These kinds of nodules are seen in those talking loudly during kirtans and jagratras. “Nodule formation can result in irritation in the voice and dryness of the throat. We get mostly teachers, untrained musicians and schoolchildren who shout in the playground or classrooms with nodules,” said Dr Sharma.The department now plans to include large group of students for its next study and follow them up after seven weeks until two months.",chandigarh,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74331407,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-180191,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/pgi-voices-speech-woes-of-tutors-party-animals/articleshow/74325392.cms

MADURAI: More than one lakh students of Madurai district from Class X, XI and XII will be sitting for the public board exam next month.

A total of 1,13,321 students are set to appear for the exams . Meanwhile, school counsellors and teachers have urged parents and students to seek help if needed to cope with exam stress. They said schools are better equipped at handling exam stress nowadays.

“There will always be fear and stress as long as exams exist. However, nowadays we are better equipped to handle exam stress since parents and students themselves are more aware about such stress,” said Vijayalakshmi C, a counsellor for school students. She also pointed out that parents and teachers must consciously monitor children especially before exams to watch out for signs of anxiety or panic attacks. “Even the brightest student can have a mental break down before exams. So, it is a must for parents and teachers to offer emotional support,” she added.

Some schools in the city are also holding yoga sessions, meditation and candle prayers to help students ease their fears. “Little things can give students the motivation and courage to face exams. We hold a special candle prayer for Class XII students and even ask them to take a small oath to work hard and do good for the society. Such little things give positive energy,” said Ambigai S, a Class XII teacher at a private school.

While the current syllabus for all three classes is voluminous, students also get leaves between exams to revise. “Of course, students who study last minute will suffer but if a student has been studying regularly, the time gap between exams is more than sufficient for good revision,” said Venkatesan V, a Class X teacher from a corporation school. Several teachers and parents also added that they try to not let their child get too caught up and skip meals before exams.

On March 2, a total of 36,293 students from Class XII will be starting their board exams in Madurai. On the other hand, in Madurai, while a total of 36,904 students from Class XI will be beginning their board exams on March 4, as many as 40,124 students from Class X will be writing their board exams from March 27.

JAIPUR: The family of Delhi Police head constable Ratan Lal , who died in CAA-related violence in the national capital on Monday, was consigned to flames only after Union minister of state for home G Krishna Reddy stated that the deceased policeman is a martyr .

“Consulted Satya Gopal, home secretary, Government of National Capital Territory of Delhi (GNCTD), head constable Ratal Lal, who was martyred while on duty is a martyr. His next of kin is now entitled for compensation amounting to nearly Rs 1 crore. The Centre may consider a suitable employment for his family member,” Reddy wrote in the message to Sikar MP Sumedhanand Saraswati, who showed it to the villagers of Tihawali.

Prior to that, Tihawali villagers staged a dharna at Sadinsar village. They decided not to take Lal’s body to the village until he had been declared a martyr. They protested for six hours in the morning at Sadinsar before Sumedhanand showed evidence of fulfilling their demand.

They blocked National Highway 11, due to which police had to divert traffic. Sumedhanand told villagers that he had been in touch with the home ministry and the demand of declaring Lal martyr will be fulfilled.

Despite his assurance, the villagers demanded it should be given written. Folowing that, Saraswati showed the message of Reddy mentioning that his kin will be given Rs 1 crore and employment to a family member.

“They were demanding it in writing. We made aware leaders in the Centre about the demand. A meeting was held on the issue and they informed me that Lal has been declared as a martyr,” said Saraswati, who added that so far not a single policeman of Delhi Police had been declared as martyr.

Talking to the newspersons, his daughter Varsha demanded that the accused involved in the killing of his father be given strict punishment. He died of bullet injury. Lal’s seven-year-old son Ram lit the funeral pyre.

People in large numbers, even from nearby villages, were present during the cremation.

Chennai: The Central Crime Branch (CCB), which has taken over the investigation into the crane accident that killed three people during the shooting of ‘ Indian 2 ’ on February 19, has asked the production unit to keep the accident site in EVP Film City as it is. A CCB team visited the shooting spot on Wednesday.

The police team led by deputy commissioner of police G Nagajothi, along with forensic experts, gathered evidence from the spot.

Police have asked the production unit to not disturb the shooting set where the accident took place until the investigation officers give the go ahead.

The officials were at the shooting spot for three hours. EVP Film City has shut the studio set.

The other studio sets, however, continue to be busy with film shoots.

Earlier, the Nazarethpet police had arrested crane operator Rajan, who later got bail from a magistrate court.

After the case was transferred from Nazarethpet to CCB last Sunday as per the direction of police commissioner A K Viswanathan, DCP Nagajothi summoned six people who engaged the crane from Mumbai. Rajan was also questioned.

Nashik: The Nashik Municipal Corporation (NMC) has deferred the election to the post of the standing committee chairperson, which was scheduled on March 3, following the state government’s stay on the appointment of eight new standing committee members.

The state government’s urban development department had put a stay to the appointments of eight new members on Tuesday. The stay came after complaints by Shiv Sena group leader Vilas Shinde. The urban development department has also sent a letter to the municipal commissioner, asking him to submit his report on Shinde’s complaints.

Accordingly, the NMC administration has decided to defer the election to the standing committee chairperson’s post as well.

NMC town secretary Raju Kute sent a letter to divisional revenue commissioner Rajaram Mane, informing him about the postponement of the election.

On Monday, mayor Satish Kulkarni had declared the names of eight new members of the standing committee — four from the BJP, two from the Shiv Sena and one each from the Congress and the NCP — after the term of eight former standing committee members came to an end.

In the 16-member standing committee, the BJP has nine seats, while the Sena has four. The Congress, NCP and the MNS have one member each. The quota of the standing committee members to political parties is decided based on their strength in terms of corporators.

During the 2017 civic elections, the BJP had won 66 seats and the Shiv Sena got 34. Accordingly, the comparative strength of both BJP and Shiv Sena was 8.65 and 4.45, respectively. Therefore, the BJP had got a quota of nine members, while Sena got a quota of four members.

The total number of BJP corporators later reduced from 66 to 64 and Sena’s number increased to 35. Owing to this, the comparative strength of the BJP reduced from previous 8.65 to 8.39, while Sena’s increased from 4.45 to 4.59.

Chennai: Lyca Productions , which is producing ‘ Indian 2 ’, with actor Kamal Haasan in the lead and S Shankar directing it, on Wednesday said it had provided all safety measures for the film’s shooting. It sought to put the ball in the court of the veteran actor and the ace director for the mishap at EVP Film City near Poonamallee which left three people dead, as the unit was under their control.

“It is profoundly unfortunate that such a tragic accident took place during the filming of ‘Indian 2’, despite our firm commitment to the highest standards of health and safety as an international firm. As you are surely aware, incidents of this nature need to be dealt with in the spirit of collective responsibility and rectification,” Neelkant Narayanpur, director, Lyca Productions Private Limited, said in a letter to actor Kamal Haasan, adding that it had also taken a comprehensive insurance policy to cover the entire production, including personal accident policy for each member working on the set.

“Given the involvement of an eminent artist and technician of your calibre and experience, and a veteran director of Shankar’s stature being the captain of the ship, we were doubly confident that our own safety measures would have been amplified by your on-the-spot judgement,” Lyca said in its letter.

Lyca’s letter was in response to actor Kamal Haasan’s earlier letter to the company questioning the steps taken by the production team to ensure the safety of the artists, crew and other technicians involved in the film’s shoot and the insurance that the production team has taken.

Earlier, a day after the accident, Kamal Haasan had expressed regret that the industry, of which he is part for decades, is yet to ensure utmost safety measures for the workers involved in film shooting and stressed the need for ensuring the same.

Three people, including an assistant director, were killed and nine others were injured in the accident during the shooting of ‘Indian 2’ when a crane crashed on a small tent while lifting a load of lighting equipment on February 19.

The deceased were among a group of people sitting inside the tent coordinating the shoot.

346,['27/02/2020'],Visiting British historian decodes politics of the suit,"This story is from February 27, 2020

Christopher Breward spoke at CSMVS on the history of Western fashion in art

Christopher Breward is acutely aware that he is wearing a T-shirt, relaxed Italian pants and trainers when he says he hates the term “business casual”. But he can’t help it. Besides being an “oxymoron” of a phrase, this annoyingly ambiguous corporate dress code also represents a “loss of trust” for this British cultural historian who has written an entire book on the history and politics of the suit. Along with “dress down Fridays”, “business casual” trigger in him the memory of a photograph from the world’s last big economic crisis in which employees in uber-fashionable London can be seen walking out of their establishment with cardboard boxes and without corporate staples of blazers and ties.

Still, you could be excused for describing what Breward, director of collection and research at the National Galleries of Scotland, was wearing during his recent lecture at the Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Vastu Sangrahalaya, as “business casual”. On more ostentatious days, the historian—who says he believes “people should wear what they like to express their identity”—tends to favour an understated, bespoke tuxedo, like the one designed by the revered late British fashion designer Alexander McQueen that Breward had received in barter for curating a British Council exhibition. “We needed a bespoke suit by McQueen, sadly no longer with us. He had done a line of suits for a tailor in Savile Row and a bespoke suit has to be made around a living body. So I said to the British Council, I can be the body around which the suit is made,” recalls the lithe 54-year-old, who was in the city to deliver a lecture on the history of Western fashion in art.

Back in the 1980s, casual eavesdropping at art galleries had shown Breward what art connoisseurs were really commenting on while looking at portraits: Clothes, hair and make-up. “I became interested in how fashion could unlock the secrets of meaning 300 years ago,” says Breward, adding now fashion houses have been funding research and exhibitions in recognition of its power to express the history of identity.

That’s how the timeless suit—which radiated patriarchy, masculinity, capitalism, power and even “subversion of authority” with immigrants in 1940s America wearing the high-waisted, tight-cuffed, wide-legged zoot suit to “own its power”—came to preoccupy Breward not too long ago. Contrary to what Indians like to believe, the suit may not have been a Western invention born in the European courts of Louis XIV or Charles II, Breward tells TOI. As a historian interested in the imports of colonialism, he tends to lean towards the theory that the attire may have had its origins in the 16th century Mughal courts of India.

SMSN delegation handing over the memorandum of demands to CM Uddhav Thackeray on Wednesday

Nagpur: A delegation of the Save Merit Save Nation (SMSN) forum, affiliated to the Save Merit Foundation in the city, met chief minister Uddhav Thackeray in his office in Mumbai on Wednesday.

State president of SMSN, Dr Sanjay Deshpande, claimed that the meeting was positive. “I think the CM will understand the seriousness of this issue and render justice to the open category and meritorious students,” he said.

“Our team drew the CM’s attention towards the alarming situation in Maharashtra due to the increase in the percentage of reservation, which has escalated from 74% to 85% with further lateral reservations. The chief minister gave us a patient hearing after which we were assured that all the concerned departments would be given instructions to review the announcements made by the previous government,” added Deshpande.

The CM also assured the delegation that he would call for a meeting with SMSN activists soon. Shiv Sena MLC Gopikishan Bajoria from Akola coordinated the meeting with the CM.

“When Devendra Fadnavis was CM, he had called SMSN members for a confidence building meeting in July 2019. After the meeting, the state government had issued five GRs, including fee reimbursement for open category students who were forced to take admission in private colleges. We want these decisions to be implemented this year as well. It will provide at least some relief to merit students of the unreserved class,” said executive president of the forum Shreekrishna Buty.

The main demand of the SMSN forum is that reservation in education should have a maximum limit of 50% as capped by the supreme court. SMSN state office-bearers Utpala Mulawkar, Sachin Poshettiwar, Abhijeet Ambhaikar, Mahesh Karwa, R B Heda, Aparna Randive and Ashutosh Pradhan were part of the delegation.

NASHIK: The Criminal Investigation Department (CID) has not ruled out the possibility of questioning the Cyberabad police team involved in the detention of the deceased city jeweller.

The Cyberabad police team had detained 47-year-old Vijay Birari for allegedly buying stolen jewellery from a Nashik burglar who had committed house break-ins in Telangana.

On Tuesday afternoon, the jeweller had jumped from the fourth floor of a government guest house to end his life. The bereaved family has accused the Cyberabad police team of excesses which drove him to suicide. The Cyberabad police team is still in Nashik.

“We will initially take the statements of the Cyberabad police team. We will be quizzing them if there are any discrepancies in their statements and the events that unfolded leading to the jeweller’s death,” sources in the state CID told TOI.

According to the CID sleuths, even the burglar — Santosh, alias Prakash Shinde — who is in the custody of Cyberabad police would be questioned on his claim that he had sold the stolen gold ornaments to Birari.

“Our probe will kick off immediately after we formally take over the case,” said the CID sources. They said they are waiting for the post mortem report to start the investigation.

Birari’s body was taken to the government medical college and hospital in the neighbouring Dhule district at 5 am on Wednesday for the post mortem.

Police officers said it is mandatory to carry out the autopsy of any person who dies in police custody at a government medical college decided by the state government. At present, Nashik does not have a government-managed medical college.

Birari’s family performed his last rites on Wednesday evening after his body was brought back from Dhule following the post mortem. Amol Tambe, the deputy commissioner of police, said the city police is unaware of the autopsy’s findings.

“In such cases, the post mortem report is opened in court and the findings are revealed there. The CID would take the copy of the report from the court concerned and begin its investigation,” he said.

At present, the Mumbai Naka police have registered a case of accidental death in connection with Birari’s suicide.

NASHIK: Over 7,000 jewellers across the district staged a peaceful protest on Wednesday following the death of Vijay Birari, a city-based jeweller. The protesters also kept their shops closed on the day.

In Nashik city, hundreds of aggrieved jewellers took part in a peaceful protest march from Saraf Bazar to the district collectorate. The march was organised by the Nashik Saraf Association (NSA).

Birari, who was detained by Cyberabad police of Telangana, jumped to death from the fourth floor of the government rest house in the city on Tuesday afternoon. The Cyberabad police had detained Birari for his alleged involvement in buying stolen gold from a burglar.

Birari was a resident of Panchavati area of the city and owned a jewellery shop in the Peth Road area.

A delegation of the association met the district administration authorities and handed over a memorandum of their demands on the matter.

Chetan Rajapurkar, president of the association, said there is a strong resentment among the jewellers fraternity not only against the Cyberabad police but also against a section of the city police authorities on the issue.

“Our association has demanded that a criminal case be lodged under section 302 of the Indian Penal Code both against the Cyberabad police team and the local police authorities,” added the association president.

Rajapurkar said that when Birari’s family and relatives came to know that he was summoned for investigation by Cyberabad police team, they went to the Panchavati police station seeking help of the police officials on the issue. “But the police declined to render any help,” alleged Rajapurkar.

According to the association, jewellers are soft targets of the police whenever any mischief monger claims of stolen jewellery sold in the market.

“Jewellers are invariably picked up by the police officers who never bother to verify whether their informer or suspect is misleading them or not. Such police action tarnishes the image of not only that particular jeweller but also of the entire fraternity,” remarked Keshav Sonar, a senior member of the association.

“Our counterparts from Kolhapur, Pune, Ahmednagar, Mumbai, etc. have expressed deep shock over the death of a member of the association and express solidarity with the fraternity,” Rajapurkar said.

MADURAI: A 40-year-old man was arrested in Madurai on Tuesday night for uploading and sharing child pornography videos and photos on social media sites.

The accused has been identified as N Kumar of Arapalayam. He was arrested based on information from the National Centre for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC) Cyber Tripline Report. Police sources said that Kumar has been watching, uploading and sharing child pornographic videos and images using his mobile phone during the last one year.

They added that the accused had posted the content on two Facebook pages. Police identified the accused by tracing the IP address of his mobile phone.

The Madurai South all-woman police registered a case against him under sections of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (Pocso) Act and the Information Technology Act.

This is the first time that a person has been arrested in Madurai district for sharing and uploading child porn content since the Tamil Nadu police recently began crackdown on people involved in distributing child pornography. Earlier, some men were arrested in districts like Chennai, Trichy and Coimbatore for sharing child pornography.

Nashik: Swatantryaveer Vinayak Damodar Savarkar was on Wednesday remembered by the people across the city and the country, many of whom visited his birthplace at Bhagur about 9 km away from the Nashik Road Railway station.

Citizens, including political figures, students and artists visited the Savarkar Waada at Bhagur to worship Goddess Ashtabhuja, the family deity of Savarkars. It is believed that Savarkar had taken an oath before the deity to fight for India’s freedom.

The Bhartiya Janata Party (BJP) had organized a rally from Nashik Road to Savarkar’s house at Bhagur. The party members held placards with ‘Rashtrabhakti Tuzhe Naav Savarkar,’ ‘SavarkarJi Ke Sanman Mein’ and ‘BJP Maidan Mein’ as they flagged off the rally in the morning.

Mayor Satish Kulkarni, BJP corporators of the Nashik Municipal Corporation and senior party functionaries paid tributes to Savarkar at his house which is now being preserved by Archaeological department.

354,['27/02/2020'],Milling: Madras high court summons three top bureaucrats,"This story is from February 27, 2020

Milled Old Mahabalipuram Road near Indira Nagar MRTS last year

CHENNAI: Just adding another layer of tar without scraping or milling plays havoc with road height and buildings find themselves going below road level overnight. Turning its attention to this civic menace, the Madras high court on Wednesday flayed officials and summoned three top secretaries of the Tamil Nadu government to appear in court on February 28 and explain the disobedience.

“No contractor is milling/scraping the road before relaying the road. It would only go to show that the contractors are not properly monitored by the officials while the work was executed and sheer negligence on the part of the officials is the root-cause for this problem. Therefore, the officials should be identified and put to task whenever milling is not done while re-laying the road,” said a division bench of Justice N Kirubakaran and Justice P Velmurugan said.

Indiscriminate laying of road without milling/scraping the existing road makes the buildings go down and the roads go up, resulting in inundation during rainy season, flooding the residential houses and other properties and blocking the drainage also, the judges said.

Citing the example of War Memorial on Kamarajar Salai, the bench said, “The Memorial has a platform surrounding it. In the 1980s, the height of the platform was about 5 feet and it was very difficult to climb on it from the road. In due course, the road has been repaired and re-laid without milling and the present condition is that the height of the road has gone up and the platform has gone down. When that is the fate of an arterial road in Chennai, one can understand the position of roads in other areas.”

The bench made the observations while hearing a plea moved by Mayiladuthurai Chamber of Commerce seeking direction to the local administration to mill existing roads in the town before relaying them. When the plea came up for hearing, the bench pointed out an order passed by the first bench of the court dated March 9, 2018, in which the state authorities made an undertaking that roads would not be relayed without milling.

The court then directed the appearance of secretaries of municipal administration, rural development, and the state highway on February 28.

Rescue workers pulling out those trapped in the bus that fell into Mej river in Bundi on Wednesday

KOTA: In a tragic accident, as many as 24 people of a wedding party were killed and five critically injured after a private bus fell into Mej river near Papdi village on Kota-Dausa highway under Lakheri police station in Bundi on Wednesday morning.

While 13 people died on the spot, others succumbed to injuries on the way to hospital in Lakheri town. The deceased included 11 women and three children. The wedding party was on its way to Sawai Madhopur city to offer ‘bhaat’ (gifts).

“At least 29 persons, including the driver, were in the bus,” DSP Shyamsunder Vishoni said. The accident occurred after the bus lost control while crossing the river at around 9.30am. The vehicle fell from a height of about 20-25 feet.

Chief minister Ashok Gehlot announced a relief of Rs 2 lakh each to kin of the deceased and Rs 40,000 to the injured.

Bundi district collector Antar Singh Nehara told TOI that three of the injured were in a state of trauma and have been sent to a hospital in Kota. Two of the injured were discharged after primary medical care, he added.

Mechanical failure is likely to have caused the accident, officials said. Two people, who escaped unhurt from the accident, said the bus lost control and fell into the river after a wheel detached from it, the district collector said.

The family of one of the survivors, Murli (55), son of Babulal Dhobi, a resident of Basant Vihar, Ganeshpal area of Kota city, was going to Sawai Madhopur along with his relatives to offer gifts for the wedding of his sister’s daughter when the accident occurred.

The four others injured have been identified as Deepak Sindhi (18) son of Narayan; Amit Dhobi (35); Kannu alias Teena (13), daughter of Suresh; and Manju (35), wife of Mahavir Dhobi, said sub-inspector Rajendra Kumar, Lakheri police station.

Deepak and Amit have been discharged while the three others are undergoing treatment, he said.

Police received information at around 9.45am and a 13-member squad from the Lakheri police station rushed to the spot.

Villagers nearby had started rescue operations after they heard the sound of the bus falling into the river. Amit Dhobi was the first survivor to come out of the bus trapped in deep waters, said SI Rajendra Kumar. He helped identify the spot where the bus fell.

“We found villagers pulling out people from the water with the help of ropes. We joined the rescue operation,” Kumar said.

The rescue effort lasted around 90 minutes and the bodies of all the deceased were retrieved from the bus. The vehicle was pulled out from the river bed in the afternoon.

The actual reason for the accident can be ascertained only after conducting a thorough investigation into the matter, the DSP said.

The post-mortem of the deceased was carried out at the Lakheri government hospital. The bodies were sent to Kota to be handed over to respective families.

357,['27/02/2020'],"Four yrs on, Bhopal smart city yet to translocate single tree","This story is from February 27, 2020

Bhopal: The first translocation of a tree under smart city project is still another few weeks away. Only 200 trees out of a possible 1,800 are now likely to be saved by translocation, given the delay in tendering process and unexpected disruptions in the ambitious urban transformation project.

“Two hundred trees have been identified which can be saved by translocation. Other measures to protect green cover are also being pursued,” said Bhopal Smart City Development Corporation Limited (BSCDCL) city engineer, OP Bhardwaj.

National Green Tribunal (NGT) on Tuesday ordered BSCDCL to maintain status quo in terms of green belt in the smart city coming up in Bhopal — which involves cutting of more than 6,000 trees in TT Nagar.

Since the smart city project began in 2015, about 500 trees have been cut for road expansion and other development in the core development area along TT Nagar. Last year, the state government announced ‘translocation of trees’ under the smart city project.

As per the new plan, BSCDCL called for a survey and translocation of the trees in TT Nagar and tenders were floated. On the third try, one agency has been shortlisted and has been entrusted to identity trees that can be saved. Initial markings indicate that 200 such trees can be saved.

Overall, the translocation would cost BSCDCL an estimated Rs 30 lakh. However, time is running out. Around 300 trees that were to be translocated to Kaliasot due to the smart road project have already been lost. More than 800 truckloads of soil from the Upper Lake area has been dumped along the smart road construction site to cover the loss of green cover. According to forest department estimates, there are around 5,700 trees, comprising 70 species in the smart city development area. Many have already been cut along core smart development site. Loss of green cover was one of the primary objections for smart city development in Shivaji Nagar. The site was later shifted to TT Nagar, which had more trees than Shivaji Nagar.

As per the smart city plan presented in 2017, BSCDCL had pledged to keep 80% of the green cover and take measures to increase the green cover in TT Nagar.

More than 1,000 trees were lost during the construction of BRTS in Bhopal around a decade ago. Experts are apprehensive as to whether translocation will work. It would cost about Rs 1.5 lakh to translocate one tree. However, the ecological impact of lesser green cover in the middle of Bhopal is yet to be assessed.

Visakhapatnam: Visakhapatnam Metropolitan Region Development Authority (VMRDA) is racing against time to prepare one-cent layouts for distribution to the homeless in Vizag city starting this Ugadi. Even though the land pooling exercise is being carried out in 10 mandals in the district for nearly 6,100 acres, officials have identified about 2,867 acres in seven mandals out of the pooled land to develop the housing sites for 1.54 lakh beneficiaries.

About 58,861 beneficiaries will be given one-cent plots in Sabbavaram mandal alone, including Gollapalem village (15,108 plots), Nanginarapadu (11,936), Yerukunaidupalem (3,363), Pydiwada (9,953) and Gangavaram (18,501). Housing sites will be allocated to nearly 38,000 families in Thangudubilli, Gandigundam and Ramavaram villages in Anandapuram mandal.

About 20,187 plots will be provided to the homeless in Mudapaka mandal. Nearly 13,000 housing sites will be developed in various villages of Parawada mandal. Other layouts will come up in Gajuwaka, Anakapalli and Pedagantyada mandal.

Visakhapatnam Metropolitan Region Development Authority estimates that basic infrastructural development works, including jungle clearance, site levelling, total station survey and peg marking with stones for the one cent plots, would cost the exchequer about Rs 57 crore. VMRDA called for tenders for the same two days ago. Civil works at these layouts are expected to begin around March 10 after finalising bidders. Visakhapatnam Metropolitan Region Development Authority metropolitan commissioner P Koteswara Rao said VMRDA engineering officials will prepare a daily report on the ongoing works at various layouts.

“VMRDA officials were asked to work in a coordinated manner to complete the works within the stipulated deadline to facilitate distribution of the housing sites to the poor,” said Koteswara Rao. VMRDA will get nearly 900 acres as its share out of the pooled land in compensation for the development of these one-cent layouts. The farmers (assignees/encroachers) will also be provided developed plots. But the size of the plots will be based on the legitimacy of possession and tenure.

While the development of one-cent layouts is estimated to cost about Rs 2 lakh per acre, expenditure on the layout development towards farmers’ share as well as VMRDA’s share is likely to hover around Rs 50 lakh per acre.

Visakhapatnam: Activists of Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP) staged a novel protest here in Visakhapatnam on Wednesday by begging for money and cleaning vehicles for the release of pending fee reimbursement and scholarship dues to the students.

ABVP city secretary L Rajayya faulted the YSRCP-led state government for not releasing the dues even after assuming office a year ago. “It is a shame on the part of the state government to make poor students wait for dues for years on end,” he said.

Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad district convener I Bhanumurthy alleged that that it is very unfortunate to see chief minister YS Jaganmohan Reddy watering down the welfare schemes introduced by his father and ex-Chief Minister YS Rajasekhara Reddy. “Youth and students played a key role in the landslide victory of Reddy in the recent elections. But after coming to power, the state government left the welfare of students to the air. We demand the government to immediately release pending dues. Otherwise, we will intensify our stir. We do not hesitate to storm the houses of ruling party MLAs, MPs, ministers and even the Assembly,” said Bhanumurthy.

Hundreds of Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad student activists took part in the protest.

A delegation of the farmers from Shivade , Sonambe, Konambe villages of Sinnar taluka and others from Igatpuri taluka met the district administration and senior officers from Maharashtra State Road Development Corporation (MSRDC) demanding better remuneration, in lines with the one offered in Jalna district.

They claimed that the Jalna district administration has given a good rate for the crops and even the plants to the farmers who gave up their land for the project. The local authorities should have drawn the inspiration from the same and given us compensation on same grounds, they said.

The district administration said the farmers’ request for re-visiting the value of the crops and the plants was not tenable. “Since the property was brought through private negotiations, they cannot challenge it in the court of law,” the officer said.

She has demanded immediate disqualification of both.

Kate said that Savle was settling old scores.

A ‘Fit India Squat Kiosk’ has been installed in Delhi’s Anand Vihar railway station on Friday

Bhopal: Soon , performing squats will help you earn a free platform ticket at Bhopal station. Witnessing the success of the squat machine installed at a station in New Delhi, the Bhopal railway division is planning to implement it at Bhopal station also. At the Anand Vihar Metro station in Delhi, doing squats 30 times in front of a machine can get you a free platform ticket and help you dodge lengthy queues.

Talking to TOI, DRM Bhopal, Uday Borwanker, said it is a good concept to encourage fitness among passengers. “We are examining it. Final decision is yet to be taken. However, it is a good concept to encourage people to understand the importance of fitness,” said Borwanker.

Incidentally, in order to promote the ‘Fit India’ campaign, a government programme that encourages Indians to adopt healthier lifestyles, a kiosk has been set up at the entrance of Anand Vihar, where a machine produces a free ticket once a passenger completes 30 squats in two minutes.

Borwanker added that there are things which need to be implemented. “I will disclose about it later. We have made several plans in this regard,” he added.

Interestingly, Vystavochnaya station, west of Moscow, introduced a similar concept in 2013 as part of promotions for the Winter Olympics in Sochi. If passengers could do at least 30 squats in two minutes, they got a free ticket.

Passengers from Bhopal who have used the machine at the Arvind Vihar station said the concept should be implemented at the earliest in Bhopal too. “This is an excellent idea. At least people would have started learning about fitness,” said Anuj Singh, a passenger.

“Railway station is the best place for installing such machines. It is a place where people from all sections come. Let people feel the need to be fit,” said Gitanjali Yadav, a passenger.

The first option being considered is Wireless Colony, which is located around 500 metres from Vizag railway station, which already has a land parcel of 20 acres. The second option being weighed is Mudasarlova, which is around 14 kilometres from the station.

Railways has sufficient land in both locations. However, in case Mudasarlova gets the nod, it might have to wait for clearance of some files from the Greater Visakhapatnam Municipal Corporation.

A senior railway official said railways has around 52.22 acres of land in Mudasarlova. “GVMC had given us the land in lieu of the land the railways had to forego for the widening of the city’s thoroughfares. An agreement for transfer of land was signed on January 12, 2016. However, the change in ownership in favour of railways is yet to reflect on the revenue records. The matter is being pursued,” said the official.

Of the 52.22 acres, a corner portion of nearly 13 acres is stuck in litigation, the official said, who added that the civic body is working on a resolution. He further said that the advantage of having the SCoR headquarters at Wireless Colony is that it is only 1km from the railway station. On the other hand, the advantage with Mudasarlova is that it is a lush green area with little pollution.

“If SCoR adopts the same principle as ECoR, which is located some 8 kilometres away from Bhubaneswar railway station, then Mudasarlova could be the ideal location for SCoR headquarters,” added the official. The only problem with having the headquarters in Mudasarlova is that it might be inconvenient for the staff to travel there from the city. A final call on the issue is likely to be taken in the first week of April.

Visakhapatnam: A woman from Amruthapuram village in Sabbavaram mandal was found dead early on Wednesday. The deceased, V Krishnaveni, was married to V Nagaraju of K Kotapadu for 11 years.

Nagaraju, who repairs punctured tyres for a living, called his in-laws over phone and told them that he was taking Krishnaveni to hospital as her stomach was aching. Minutes later, he rang them up again saying she had died.

According to sources, Nagaraju who married Krishnaveni eleven years ago, harassed her suspecting her fidelity.

The couple have two children — a 10-year-old girl and a one-year-old boy.

Krishnaveni’s relatives allege that her husband and mother-in-law were behind the murder . They accused Nagaraju of torturing his wife several times in the past questioning her fidelity.

“He claimed that he is taking her to hospital and later said she died. When we reached his house, Krishnaveni’s body was lying outside,” one of the relatives said.

Nagaraju claimed Krishnaveni committed suicide by hanging herself to a ceiling when her parents and relatives questioned him. A police complaint has been lodged and investigation is underway.

RAKHIGARHI (HISAR): One of the five biggest townships of Harappan civilisation excavated till date, Rakhigarhi, lies shrouded under black plastic sheets and heaps of mud across nine interconnected mounds spread across 350 hectares of land in rural Haryana .

It remains, however, partly encroached, with some areas still under farming and others dotted with rural dwellings. So far, only 83.5 acres of the spread has been notified as “protected” by the Archaeological Survey of India.

But finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman designating Rakhigarhi as one of the five iconic sites where museums shall be built, has fuelled the pace of work on India’s antiquities. It has also galvanised work on the a 5.5 acre museum, said to be the largest one on Harappan civilisation, in the village of Rakhigarhi, less than 100 metres away from the site of excavation.

Efforts to clear the encroached land around the excavation site, however, have met with some resistance from local residents who have expressed unhappiness over the rehabilitation plans proposed by the local administration. Reactions have been largely negative to the government’s proposal to move the rural families into 160 new flats being constructed. “We are farming families and we raise cattle. We live in 500 yard homes and the houses being promised to us are less than half in size. Where will we keep our animals? Only those living in smaller houses will agree to this,” said Soorajbhan Singh, a resident of Rakhigarhi.

Hisar deputy commissioner Priyanka Soni, though, says the government is making efforts to rehabilitate families. Minister of state for tourism and culture, Prahlad Singh Patel , who visited the archaeological site on Sunday assured villagers that while protecting the site is priority, concerns of the villagers will also be addressed.

“Excavation on this site unearthed skeletons and the existence of an entire township. It points to the existence of an ancient people and a rich tradition. As a result, this is an important site. However, I am confident that the Haryana government will resolve the problems of the local people. It is our plan to develop this area as a big tourist hub,” Patel said.

Even as they iron out locals’ concerns, the state government has begun work on a state-of-the-art museum replete with seven dimensional technologies, photography and conservation laboratories, access control and intrusion systems, and a wifi enabled campus that will give visitors an immersive experience into Rakhigarhi and the Harappan civilisation. The main attraction, architect Vishank Kapoor said, is the museum’s facade replicating the gates of the ancient town of Mohaenjodaro .

Bhopal: State mountaineer Megha Parmar, who has already scaled world’s highest peak, Mt Everest, will now attempt to climb Australia’s mainland highest mountain, Mount Kosciuszko. Her expedition will begin on March 2.

Earlier, Megha and fellow mountaineer Bhawna Dehariya had faced a setback while trying to scale Mt Aconcagua when they had to abort the expedition midway, die to bad weather. Megha has successfully completed the summit of three mountains-Everest, Kilimanjaro and Elbrus, while Bhawna has completed summits of Everest and Kilimanjaro so far. These two mountaineers have brought glory to the state, and with every new challenge, they are promoting the messages of ‘Beti Bachao, Beti Padhao’ and ‘Fit Rahega India, Tabhi To Badhega India’.

Mount Kosciuszko is at 2,228 m (7,310 ft) above sea level. It is located on the main range of the snowy mountains in Kosciuszko National Park, part of the Australian Alps national parks and reserves, in New South Wales, Australia.

Megha will leave Bhopal for the expedition today. “I will start the expedition from March 2 to complete it on March 7,” she said. She had managed to overcome immense odds and nagging pain from a broken back last year to conquer Mt Everest. Megha had even suffered snow blindness and high altitude sickness on the way down and had to spend several days in hospital before people back home realized that she had been on the top of the world.

Seven Summits are the highest mountains of each of the seven continents. Climbing all of them is regarded as a mountaineering challenge, first achieved on 30 April 1985 by Richard Bass.

Visakhapatnam: Around 12 plastic collection counters will be set up in rhythu bazaars and along the national highway within a month by India Youth for Society (IYFS) in association with the district administration.

The plastic parlour set up two months ago by IYFS on Beach road initially saw good collection, but now it has dwindled to just a few kg of plastic per day. Therefore, IYFS volunteers are setting up collection centres across the city to make the public aware of the adverse impact of plastic. Speaking about the plastic collection venture, Y Appala Reddy, president of IYFS and director of Plastic Free India Campaign said, “For the first 10 days, our plastic parlour on Beach Road got very good response. The residents of surrounding posh localities and morning walkers dropped in and we collected about 15-20 kg of plastic daily. But gradually the enthusiasm reduced and some days we did not get any plastic. On an average, we started getting about 1-2 kg thereafter. To encourage the public to bring waste, for every kg of plastic, we give one cup of coffee for free and for four kg of plastic, we offer a jute bag.”

“After a month, we decided to conduct plastic collection drive in rhythu bazars in MVP Colony and Madhurwada and collected around 40 kg of plastic in a single day. Therefore, we decided to set up counters across various rhythu bazaars, other busy centres and along national highway. We are working on obtaining permission from the district administration. The waste collected are carried by trucks, mostly supplied by GVMC, and sent to the recycling yard at Kappuluppada,” Reddy explained.

The rhythu bazaars where counters are being planned include Seethammadhara, Narasimhanagar, MVP Colony, Pedda Waltair, Gopalapatnam, Marripalem, Pedagantiyada, Gajuwaka, Steel Plant, Kancharlapalem, Madhurawada and Pendurthy. Those interested can deposit plastic waste with IYFS by calling 9703489797 or email to support@plasticfreeindia.org.

Further, to generate awareness about the damage caused by plastic pollution and to highlight the benefits of recycling, a deeksha programme and photo exhibition on plastic waste rules is being organised on March 14 from 9 am to 6 pm at Gandhi Statue.

Visakhapatnam: The joint action committee (JAC) formed for the protection of tribal rights and the implementation of Acts has demanded that the government cancel Araku Utsav scheduled to be held on February 29 and MArch 1.

“If the government does not call off the festival, tribals will obstruct the event,” a member of the JAC said. If any untoward incident takes place, then tribal representatives MP G Madhavi, MLAs Bhagya Lakshmi of Paderu and S Phalguna of Araku should be held responsible, he added.

The JAC alleged the government was preparing to conduct Araku Utsav spending Rs 1 crore at a time when tribals were agitating for the implementation of Acts protecting their rights.

JAC district convenor Ramarao Dora and co-convenors M Rajababu and T Jagatrai alleged non-tribals were occupying their lands in violation of the 5th Schedule of the Constitution.

Non-tribal migration has increased with the introduction of tourist projects in Araku Valley, Anantagiri, Lammasingi and other areas in Visakha agency. These migrations have become a threat to the rights of tribals giving rise to anti-social activities including sale of sedative drugs and spreading of AIDs and other communicable diseases, locals alleged.

The committee alleged that tribals were losing their identity, traditions and values due to the imposition of non-tribal cultures. Presently, tribals in all 11 mandals in Visakha Agency have been agitating for their rights.

Story 1:

Sudipta.Sengupta@timesgroup.com

Hyderabad: From much before 9am, the parking lot at Nizam’s Institute of Medical Sciences (NIMS) starts filling up. Hundreds wait here for a particular autorickshaw — one that has been pulling up at the same spot for the past 1,212 days — carrying their daily plate of scrumptious breakfast.

On the menu: piping hot rawa upma made in desi ghee.

Serving the first person in a queue of more than 100 — it goes up to 400 on most days — Mohd Shujathullah says: “Today is my 1,213th day here… even on holidays and festivals I am here. I never miss a single day.” NIMS is the third stop for this 27-year-old from Musheerabad who begins the breakfast run from Koti Maternity Hospital at 8am every day. In between, at 8.30am, he serves about 400 at Niloufer Hospital too.

“On an average, 1,000 people eat every day. By end of the year, I hope the count reaches 5,000,” says the founder of Humanity First Foundation, a Doctor of Pharmacy by education. This journey, he recollects, started after he flunked his third year BPharm exam. “I had promised to feed 10 homeless people if I cleared it the next time. Little did I then know, it would become my life’s mission,” says Shujathullah describing that first experience as being almost spiritual.

While the drive was initially self-funded, with some support from family and friends, he now manages to raise donations to cover the monthly expenses of Rs1.5 lakh. But his biggest takeaway: the duas that people shower after every meal.

“He is doing a great deed. Allah will bless him,” says 50-year-old Zainab Begum, who travels to NIMS from Mallepally at least 15 days a month. Her husband is paralytic. “We leave home at 6.30am. This breakfast is the only food we have till we get home late in the afternoon,” she adds.

In fact, K Maruti’s 35-year-old daughter, admitted for a neurological disorder, looks forward to the upma every morning. “She loves it. It is better than any other food you get around here,” the doting father says as he packs an extra tiffin box for her. “Also, it saves us Rs100-150 every day,” he says.

Story 2:

Taking ownership of our natural resources

Uttara.Varma@timesgroup.com

For years, Sainikpuri residents have dealt with high E. coli content in their water. But that’s never surprised Deepa Shailendra. “I see people dump waste into the Kapra Lake all the time. What they don’t understand is that the water body recharges our aquifers. The water they pollute today, could be flowing through their taps tomorrow,” said the local who, in 2017, brought together 11 people to discuss the lake.

From then on, the ‘Kapra Lake revival’ group has only grown.

The group began with a campaign to promote clay Ganeshas and soon moved on to clean-ups at the lake and anti-plastic drives. “We cannot bequeath a cesspool to our children,” says Deepa. The movement has included people from all walks of life: children and even people in wheelchairs.

The group has gone all out to protect the lake even reaching out to minister KT Rama Rao. “I petitioned KTR and the government on the issue. Telugus believe in vaastu. The lake is in the north-east of the city and needs to be kept pure for prosperity,” says Deepa.

She says that while litigation has been crippling pace of work, she is hopeful that constant attention will hinder encroachers.

“The lake has been a great example of how every person can take ownership of a public asset.”

On the ground, the change is stark. Vast swathes of waste in the lake are no longer visible and residents can be seen taking stock of the situation daily. Those living in the neighbourhood sound out an alert to group members in case of people come to dump their garbage, and they are promptly counselled and sent back.

Deepa’s plans do not stop at the lake. “I have started a group that is working on organic gardening, another for caring for stray animals, and yet another to promote sustainable living,” she says. Deepa hopes to make Sainikpuri a model community that can be replicated in other places.

BS Yediyurappa

BENGALURU: Some of the state’s tallest political functionaries will descend on Bengaluru’s Palace Ground on Thursday to celebrate chief minister BS Yediyurappa ’s 77th birthday.

BJP sources confirmed all who were invited, including five former chief ministers — SM Krishna, HD Kumaraswamy, Siddaramaiah, Jagadish Shettar and DV Sadananda Gowda — have agreed to attend. Defence minister Rajnath Singh will inaugurate the event, while BJP national general secretary (organisation) BL Santosh will also be present.

In a tweet on Wednesday, Yediyurappa requested well-wishers not to bring bouquets, flowers, shawls, sweets, turbans or souvenirs. “As I enter a new year of my life tomorrow, I am indebted for all the love and support I’ve received from all of you at every stage of my life. Whatever I have achieved today is a result of the blessings and faith that the people of my state have showered on me and that is all I seek from all of you,” he tweeted.

Some see the event as an attempt by Yediyurappa and his loyalists to send a message to the central leadership that he is still going strong. Under Narendra Modi and Amit Shah, the BJP has retired several members who crossed the age of 75. Yediyurappa has been an exception.

Moreover, a mysterious letter recently surfaced which questioned his health and style of functioning. The unsigned letter, believed to be the handiwork of disgruntled BJP leaders who were denied cabinet berths, said at the age of 77, Yediyurappa should retire from electoral politics and instead mentor youngsters in the party.

Sources said Yediyurappa’s family and supporters are now pulling out all stops to ensure a grand celebration on Thursday to counter critics. But a senior functionary rubbished the rumours, saying, “The event is only a birthday celebration. It's not a political event. It has nothing to do with Yediyurappa’s political career.”

Delhi high court

NEW DELHI: Hours after conducting a midnight hearing to ensure that victims of violence in northeast Delhi got immediate medical help, including ambulances, Delhi high court on Wednesday said it won’t let another 1984 occur under its watch.

“We cannot let another 1984 scenario (when the anti-Sikh riots took place) occur again. We don’t want a repeat at all. The city has seen enough anguish, tragedy and violence. Not under the watch of this court,” the bench said after being told of the rising death toll, including the killing of an Intelligence Bureau (IB) officer in the violence.

The court stepped in a little after Tuesday midnight and conducted a special hearing at the residence of Justice S Muralidhar, the senior-most judge available in absence of the Chief Justice, who was out of station.

The judge noted in his early morning order that he received a call from a lawyer apprising him about riot victims stuck at Al-Hind Hospital in New Mustafabad. The lawyer explained that the victims couldn’t be moved from the small hospital to GTB Hospital in the absence of ambulances.

A bench of Justices S Muralidhar and Anup J Bhambhani directed Delhi Police to ensure safe passage for the victims to government hospitals and provide them emergency treatment.

The bench asked additional standing counsel Sanjoy Ghose to ensure the presence of the joint commissioner and DCP (Crime) at the judge’s residence and then spoke over the phone to Dr Anwar at Al-Hind Hospital. The doctor informed that two bodies and 22 injured people were at the hospital. He added that the hospital and the injured had been trying to seek police assistance since 4pm.

The judges made DCP Rajesh Deo speak with the doctor and also coordinate with the area DCP, who immediately reached the hospital to evacuate the injured to the nearest hospital.

Later in the morning, the bench lauded police for promptly evacuating the injured and suggested that the highest functionaries of Delhi reach out to the affected people and personally meet the victims and their families.

In the meanwhile, the court gave a slew of directions to augment the helpline for victims and directed that private ambulances be provided for their safe passage.

Stressing on the need to rebuild confidence, the court said this was the time to reach out to people and give them assurance. It ordered the AAP government to open shelters with basic facilities, including blankets, medicines, food and sanitation, on a war-footing and said that night shelters and community halls could be used for the same.

Advocate Zubeda Begum was appointed amicus curiae to coordinate between the victims and various agencies for providing medical assistance and safe passage.

The court was hearing two pleas, one seeking safe passage to government hospitals and emergency treatment for the injured and the other for lodging of FIRs and arresting those involved in the violence in which around 200 people were hurt.

A CLASSIC EVENING

After mesmerising the audience with several magnificent classical performances, the weeklong Khajuraho dance festival came to an end on Wednesday.The spectators enjoyed the splendour of Indian classical dances in the backdrop of a spectacular view of Chitragupta temple, in Khajuraho, Chattarpur district, at this festival organised by Ustad Allauddin Khan Sangeet Evam Kala Academy, MP.

The finale started with the performance of Srividya Angara, performing ‘Mandodari Saptam’ to describe the marriage of Mandodari and Ravana in Kuchipudi dance style. The entire saga of Mandodari -who was said to be a frog, falling in love with mighty Ravana, her prayers to Lord Brahma, her subsequent transformation into a beautiful woman - was majestically presented by the dancer. Ravana falling for Parvati and his wanting to end his marriage were all explained through excellent synergy of bhava, abhinaya and nritya. “I'm privileged to offer my dance to the audience on such an auspicious stage,” an overwhelmed Angara later said.

A melange of two diverse dance forms - Odissi and Bharatanatyam - by Enakshi Sinha and Pavitra Bhat - respectively, was a sight for the sore eyes. Third presentation of the evening - ‘Shiv Panchakshra’ in Manipuri style performed by Sinam Basu and her group- was equally bewitching, bringing to fore the rich cultural traditions of India. The evening ended with the kathak presentation by Amita Khare.

During the fest, audience enjoyed some of stalwarts like Uma Sharma, Jatin Goswami, Meera Das, Shobana Pillai, Narthaki Nataraj etc. putting forth some memorable dance performances. Young Mohika Saxena's Bharatanatayam also enchanted the audience. Pursuing her bachelors in dental surgery at Bhopal, Mohika gave three performances and each one of them was appreciated a lot by everyone.

Over 22000 people attended the weeklong fest in Khajuraho; and it was also watched by over 40000 live audience each day as the event was webcast, said an official of the organising committee of the event.For those in the audience who attended each day, the end 'left a void.' A connoisseur and self-confessed lover of all forms of Indian art, 85-year-old Satish Mehta who had come from Mumbai, said, ""I first attended Khajuraho festival in its inception year in 1975 and never missed a single edition post that. Every time I leave this place with a heavy heart because there is a quintessential spirituality attached with this particular event.""

It was heartening to see a lot of youngsters at the finale, who witnessed the classical magnum opus in awe. All of 23, Aman Dixit, a student of financial engineering, had come from Sagar along with his family to attend the annual fest. ""This event will remain etched forever in my mind,"" said he and added, ""I wish such wonderful ethnic cultural fests are promoted well, just like pop, hip-hop, rock or Bollywood events. I'm sure many more youngsters will rediscover this genre once they get up close with it. I was exposed to classical festivals since childhood thanks to my parents, but there are so many people my age who need to know about the inherent beauty of classical forms.""

Dhar: Chief minister Kamal Nath on Wednesday laid the foundation for a micro lift irrigation project in Dahi village and named it after freedom fighter Tantya Bheel. The project would irrigate around 47,000 hectares of agricultural area in about 106 villages of Dhar and Alirajpur districts.

While participating in the public programme, Nath inaugurated 40 projects worth Rs 1,218 crore.

Addressing the public, CM praised tribal people for their sincerity, simplicity and hard-working nature. Nath said that his government is committed to improve state’s deteriorated economy inherited by us. “We are making a policy that improves the condition of farmers. Efforts have been started to revive the purchasing power of the farmers, which crumpled over the last several years. He said that the state's condition will change with the comprehensive policies of the state government. Shri Kamal Nath said that 70% population of the state is based on agriculture. State government is making every effort to improve the condition of the farmers through schemes like 'Jai Kisan Fasal Wrin Maafi Yojana'.

He asked locals to remain alert from opposition leaders who he alleged were propogating falsehoods. “Unlike (former chief minister) Shivraj Singh Chouhan, I don’t believe in making announcements, but delivering goods,” said Nath.

He took a dig at Prime Minister Narendra Modi on his alleged failure in generating employment, doubling farmers’ income .

The gathering was addressed by cabinet ministers Dr Vijaylaxmi Sadho and Surendra Singh Baghel, who explained benefits of the micro lift irrigation project for the locals.

According to the officials concerned, the project using 58.47 MW electricity, three pump houses will draw Narmada water from a distance of 17.82 km through the pipeline and will supply at a pace of 16.06 cubic m/s. It will take 48 months in completion of the project.

381,['27/02/2020'],Char Dham mahapanchayat distances itself from priests’ comments of ‘natural calamity if shrine board runs temples’,"This story is from February 27, 2020

Dehradun: A day after TOI reported that priests from the Char Dham shrines of Kedarnath, Badrinath, Gangotri and Yamunotri have warned pilgrims not to visit the shrine towns as they “might witness something worse than the 2013 tragedy if a shrine board runs their temples,” Suresh Semwal, convener of the Char Dham mahapanchayat , a body representing priests of the Char Dham shrines distanced the body from the remarks, saying, “The priests, who are asking people not to embark on the yatra, are doing so in their personal capacity.” He however added that if the government goes ahead with the shrine board, they will be “forced to launch a massive nation-wide protest that would bring down the BJP government.”

“We are the only people who know the rituals of the Char Dham temples. Without us, the government will neither be able to commence the yatra nor conduct puja properly. We hope that the government will not disturb us and let us continue the work that we have been doing since centuries. If they don’t, they should be ready to face the consequences,” Semwal said.

Harish Dimri, a priest from Badrinath, said that the government action of setting up a shrine board hasn’t sent a good message to pilgrims. “I won’t say anything beyond this as the matter is now in court,” he added.

Brijesh Sati, another priest from Badrinath said that “no priest in the revered shrine will boycott puja but instead, we will call for a bandh.”

“We will not boycott the rituals. People are welcome to the Char Dham shrines, but we will continue to show our resentment. For this, we will plan a bandh with local traders and shopkeepers but no ancient ritual will be disturbed,” he said adding that if some priests are boycotting the yatra, that is their personal decision.

Meanwhile, IAS officer Ravinath Raman, who was recently appointed as CEO of Uttarakhand Char Dham Devasthanam Board, sought to allay the priests’ concerns. “We are mulling to put in place the new arrangements which will be more professional. Having said that, no one is disturbing the worship and traditional things associated with the temples. Let me be clear that this Act is not taking away anyone’s rights,” he added.

The district administration found that the government had followed due procedure while transferring the land t... Read More

BENGALURU: A report into the controversy surrounding the allotment of land to Harobele Kapalabetta Development Trust in Kanakapura taluk, Ramanagara district, has reportedly found no illegalities or violation of law. The trust had planned to erect a 114-ft statue of Jesus Christ on a portion of the land, a decision which members of the Sangh Parivar have taken exception to.

The report was submitted to the government by the Ramanagara district administration, but indications are that it will be put in cold storage for the time being. The Ramanagara administration was tasked with filing the report after the row over the statue erupted.

The report, which was submitted to the government on Monday, found that the 10 acres allotted to the trust was gomala land (land reserved for cattle grazing), but the previous coalition government led by HD Kumaraswamy had followed due procedure before allotting the land.

The issue hit the headlines after former minister and senior Congress functionary DK Shivakumar, who represents Kanakapura assembly segment, laid a foundation stone for the statue on December 25 last year.

BJP leaders had argued that the 10 acres sanctioned to the trust was gomala land and the construction of the statue, was therefore illegal. The Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), Vishva Hindu Parishad (VHP), Hindu Jagaran Vedike (HJV) and other right wing organisations had also taken out a protest march in Kanakapura against the installation of the statue and had stepped up pressure on the government to take back the land.

Following these developments, revenue minister R Ashoka had sought a report from the district administration and issued two notices to Harobele Kapalabetta Development Trust. District officials conducted a survey before preparing their report.

Now though, the report will be kept under wraps for obvious reasons. “The report was prepared based on facts ascertained during the survey. Our team just stuck to the terms reference given to us regarding land allotment. We did not look into the other aspects of the installation of the statue,” said MS Archana, Ramanagara deputy commissioner.

Asked if the land would be taken back and Gomala status restored, Archana remained noncommittal, saying: “That is up to the government.” Revenue department sources said the government may not make the report public, but would wait for an appropriate time to revive the issue.

Chinnaraju, member of Harobele Kapalabetta Development Trust, reiterated the trust was not in a hurry to resume work on the statue. “We would be happy if the government and people know the truth that we have not committed any illegality. But, we will wait before resuming work as we want to go about in an amicable manner,” said Chinnaraju.

Shivakumar also reiterated that he had no role to play anymore in the issue. “I played my role as representative of constituents and guided them in following rules before getting the land parcel granted. I have no further involvement in activities of the trust,” he said.

383,['27/02/2020'],VACB finds VS Sivakumar’s locker clean,"This story is from February 27, 2020

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Vigilance and anti-corruption sleuths could not find any documents or articles from the bank locker of former minister V S Sivakumar which was examined as part of a probe into a disproportionate assets case against him.

Bank officials opened the locker in the presence of vigilance sleuths on Wednesday. Sivakumar had said he had lost the locker key of the bank. The vigilance sleuths had earlier conducted searches at the residences of Sivakumar and his close associates and had seized documents.

Sivakumar, on Wednesday, said that his innocence has been proved again. The Congress leader said that he had told the vigilance team during the search that the key was lost as the locker was not being used, and had shared the details of the locker with the sleuths. He said the documents that the vigilance had seized from his residence were some receipts of property tax, registration document of the house, receipts of remittance of power and water bills, loan documents of the house and car and life insurance policy documents. He alleged that he is being hunted on the basis of anonymous complaints, and suspect vested interests in maligning his reputation. Allegations against him were found baseless in the vigilance inquiry earlier, he said.

Even though the agency could not find any disproportionate assets after conducting a preliminary inquiry against Sivakumar, the agency sleuths had noticed that there is a disproportionate increase in the assets of his associates, thus inferring that they are the former minister’s benamis. However, the vigilance has been unable to find evidence to substantiate it.

Meanwhile, the vigilance seized 155 sovereigns from the bank locker of Harikumar, a close associate of Sivakumar. The vigilance seized the locker keyboard after making a record of it and the locker key will be submitted in the court. Vigilance suspects Harikumar to be Sivakumar’s benami. Vigilance sources said that if the investigation reveals that there are bank lockers for the other three, those will also be examined.

DEHRADUN: To protest against what they termed the “anti-people policies” of the incumbent state government, Uttarakhand Congress launched a “lantern yatra” from Haldwani on Wednesday. The yatra was so named because the party was “trying to find out the development done under BJP rule using a lantern.”

Hundreds of Congress workers and residents participated in the yatra along with senior party leaders, including state president Pritam Singh, state-in-charge Anugrah Narayan Singh, leader of opposition Indira Hriyadesh, former CM Harish Rawat and others. Congress leaders urged workers to “go door-to-door to tell people about the anti-people policies of the BJP government in the state.”

“BJP government is promoting alcohol use by making it cheaper. There is no development but only scams all around. The ministers are always travelling here and there and the bureaucrats hardly pay attention to developmental projects. Due to all this, the common man is left to suffer. To make the public aware of this government’s inefficiency, we have launched a lantern yatra . The yatra is symbolic of the fact that even with all this extra light (from our lanterns), we can’t see any development anywhere,” said Pritam Singh while addressing a gathering at MB Inter College of Hadwani.

Congress leaders added that the state unit of the party is drafting a report card of the ruling BJP which will cover issues related to unemployment, education, medical facilities, and decisions like formation of the Devasthanam Shrine Board Act.

A day before the yatra, on Tuesday, former CM Harish Rawat uploaded a video on Twitter showing potholes on NH 309 that connects Uttar Pradesh with Kumaon region. In the video, the former CM questioned if “this is the development that has taken place during BJP rule?”

In the video, Rawat can be heard saying, “Mujhe yahan gaddhon mein road dhoondni pad rahi hai CM sahab. Kya aap thoda dhyaan denge? (I have to search for the road in the potholes. Will you pay attention, CM sir?)”

Trichy: Leaders from various farmers’ associations have met chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswami and thanked him for announcing the delta districts as a protected agriculture zone. They invited him for a felicitation function to be organised in Tiruvarur on March 7 to thank him for passing a resolution in this regard in the assembly.

Farmers headed by general secretary of Tamil Nadu Cauvery Delta Farmers’ Welfare Association Mannargudi S Ranganathan, president of Cauvery Irrigation Farmer’s Welfare Association Mahathanapuram V Rajaram and state organizer of the farmers’ wing of Tamil Manila Congress Puliyur A Nagarajan met the chief minister in Trichy on Wednesday, while he was on his way to Thanjavur to attend a marriage. They thanked him for his announcement made in Salem and the subsequent resolution in the assembly.

Speaking to reporters, S Ranganathan said that when the entire farming community was worried that whether the delta region would retain its status due to the ongoing hydrocarbon exploration executed by the BJP-led Union government, the chief minister has taken an excellent decision to safeguard it. “To felicitate him, the entire farming community has organised a meeting to be held at Amma Square in Tiruvarur on March 7,” he said. He appealed to the government to ban sand mining in the rivers in Tamil Nadu, which is also a grave threat to cultivation. He said that farmers would submit a memorandum to the chief minister during the meeting. Meanwhile, Puliyur A Nagarajan welcomed the chief minister at Mukkombu, while he was visiting the construction site of the new barrage across the Kollidam. He thanked him for allotting fund to execute Cauvery-Guntaru linking project. He appealed to him to include Trichy, Karur and Ariyalur within the protected agriculture zone, as thousands of acres of land in these districts are irrigated by the Cauvery.

386,['27/02/2020'],"Delhi violence: As injured poured in, Al-Hind Hospital ran out of even first aid","This story is from February 27, 2020

The hospital was overburdened with injured people for the last two days

NEW DELHI: When 21-year-old Taslim Fatima got the news of her husband’s death, she had only been a bride for 11 days. The young woman got married to Ashfaque Hussain on February 14. On Tuesday, Hussain was one of the people who succumbed to a gunshot injury at Mustafabad’s Al-Hind Hospital.

The hospital was overburdened with injured people for the last two days as rioters continued to wreak havoc in the neighbourhood.

“I didn’t even get to know him. But in the few days that we were together, I received a lifetime of love,” Fatima said. The newly wed bride kept looking at her mehndi, which had still not faded away, and the tears didn’t stop. As she spoke of her wedding day, her sobs slowly subsided into silence.

Relatives said Ashfaque went out of his home in Mustafabad with his brother to get rations when he heard people talking about a mosque being set ablaze. They rushed to check on relatives who stayed in the area. When they reached the mosque, they saw over 500 people attacking it. Bullets were being fired by the mob.

“A stray bullet hit Ashfaque. My elder son somehow managed to get him to a hospital, but he bled to death,” said his mother. Doctors at Al-Hind said there were at least 70 people, including 10 with bullet injuries, in the hospital. Three succumbed to their gunshot wounds because of lack of doctors.

Chaos in the hospital began two nights ago when the injured started to come in large numbers. There weren’t enough staff or medicines for them. After tending to the first few casualties, the hospital even ran out of first-aid. A call for help was put online and volunteers managed to crowdsource medicines through local chemists. But it was too little too late.

“We were constantly calling for ambulances, but they were stopped by police as the situation was tense near Mustafabad,” said Shahnawaz, a hospital employee.

When TOI reached the hospital on Wednesday, Mohammad Owais, who had sustained a bullet wound, was being taken to GTB Hospital for further treatment. “I was shot on my shoulder two days ago while returning from office. A mob emerged from Brijpuri and attacked me,” said the 22-year-old. Other injured at the hospital was the father-son duo of Abdul Mukeem and Muzammil. The father, a tailor, was hit on the head at Shiv Vihar while coming back with his son on a bike.

Dr Harjit Bhatti, a resident doctor at AIIMS, reached the spot after receiving an SOS. He told TOI that healthcare services were insufficient and the volatility in the area made the situation worse. “When we reached, a mob threatened to destroy our ambulance. We were initially not even allowed to go to the hospital till the high court intervened. Had we managed to get there sooner, maybe we could have saved them,” he said, adding that people were still hiding in their homes, afraid to come to hospitals because of the fear of being attacked.

Another gunshot victim was 28-year-old Zakir, who had gone to offer prayers at the mosque that was attacked. His family members said he was shot at least thrice. Zakir leaves behind his wife Muskan and two daughters aged eight and four. He was the eldest son in the family and their sole breadwinner. A welder by profession, he earned Rs 8,000 per month.

The family had not received the body sent for autopsy. They had only received photographs of the body on their phones. As Zakir’s brother passed on the phone to Muskan, her eight-year-old daughter Ayesha peered into it. She was promptly stopped by Muskan.

“I do not want my daughter to remember her father’s brutalised body,” she sobbed. She narrated the father-daughter’s daily ritual of studying together. “He taught her Urdu and she helped him with English,” she added.

Zakir’s mother, Meena, said, “My husband passed away 12 years ago. He was the only support I had at the time. He made sure that his brother finished his schooling and took the responsibility of his sister’s wedding. We have lived here for ages, but we have never felt so unsafe. We are afraid to leave our houses.”

Representative image

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The crime branch team probing missing ammunition of the police has arrested sub-inspector Reji Balachandran , who was found to have replaced the missing ammunition with forged ones in 2014.

Currently, a trainer sub-inspector with Kerala Armed Police battalion-3 in Adoor , Balachandran was the quarter master in special armed police (SAP) in 2014, when the shells went missing. According to crime branch officials, in July 2014, when Balachandran found that about 350 drill cartridges were missing, he replaced them with forged ones in the quarter guard. Balachandran is one of the 11 police officers accused in the case, and probe is on against the remaining officials. He has been remanded in 14-day judicial custody by first class magistrate here.

The crime branch is also probing the role of senior officers in missing cartridges case, and also if the missing cartridges have gone into terrorists or Maoists hands, crime branch director Tomin J Thachankary said.

The police had registered a case in connection with the missing cartridges on April 3, 2019, at Peroorkkada police station in the capital under sections 403, 409, 420, 424, 468 and 471 of IPC and the case was handed over to crime branch in June last year.

The crime branch team, after considering the report of the comptroller and auditor general (CAG) that cited 25 Insas rifles and over 12,000 cartridges missing, had prepared a detailed plan of action and launched a probe into the matter. The guns were verified personally after summoning them from all the units and it was found that there was no shortage as was cited by the CAG report. However, in the case of ammunitions, the crime branch team had found that the cartridges were indeed missing and a search was conducted at the SAP in the capital last week.

The crime branch team took into custody an SAP emblem weighing nearly 2.5kg and believed to be made using empty shells along with 350 dummy cartridges. After examining several registers and documents, and questioning 22 witnesses, the sub-inspector was arrested on Wednesday.

The probe team led by crimes DSP B Anil Kumar comprises 15 members from the crime branch, that is being supervised by IG (crimes) S Sreejith and SP (crimes) A Shanavas. Crime branch sources said that more arrests will be recorded in the coming days in the case.

388,['27/02/2020'],Multiple surveys amid CAA-NRC fear spook locals,"This story is from February 27, 2020

GHMC commissioner DS Lokesh Kumar

HYDERABAD: Two door-to-door surveys launched in the city almost simultaneously, amid raging protests over the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and National Register of Citizens (NRC) in the country, has left residents across Hyderabad unsettled. Questioning the timing of these surveys, they fear that this might create unnecessary panic among people, even if they are routine exercises.

Along with the Telangana Literacy Survey, the state is executing phase 1 of the central government’s National Sample Survey (NSS), too, comprising two parts — Domestic Tourism Expenditure Survey and Multiple Indicators Survey (MIS).

While the literacy survey is believed to be the first of its kind launched across Telangana, officials confirmed that the MIS component — which, among other things, collects data on availability of birth registration certificate of individuals — has also been added to the 78th NSS for the first time.

On Wednesday, some residents from Old Malakpet refused to divulge details when enumerators landed at their doorstep for the National Sample Survey (NSS). In a video widely circulated, one of them is heard saying: “Are you not aware of what is happening in the country? How can you expect people to share any details under such circumstances? People are scared. Would you have shared these details (about family members’ birth dates, recent travels etc) if asked?”

The NSS is being conducted by the Union ministry of statistics & programme implementation. “Maybe it is indeed a harmless exercise, as officials claim. But to launch it at a time when people are already reeling under the fear of CAA-NRC-NPR, is inappropriate. It is only elevating their concerns,” said S Alam, resident of an apartment complex in Somajiguda that was visited by Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) staff on Tuesday, for the literacy survey.

In other parts of the city too — right from Barkas to Gachibowli — the surveys have raised eyebrows. “Since the literacy survey was announced, people are discussing it. The fear is palpable among people across all economic strata of society,” said Zakir Hussain, board member of Salar Jung Museum who lives in Gachibowli.

Officials, however, insist there’s no reason for worry. DS Lokesh Kumar, GHMC commissioner, feels the survey will show how Telangana’s illiteracy rate has dropped significantly — maybe below 15%.

G Lakshminarayana, joint director, Directorate of Economic and Statistics (Telangana) claimed the birth certificate data (under NSS) did not entail providing hard copies. “We are only asking people if they are aware that they need to register the birth of family members with the concerned authorities. We don’t want any physical copies,” he said.

389,['27/02/2020'],"3-day strike, weekend and Holi holiday: Banks shut for 6 days","This story is from February 27, 2020

Indore: Hundreds of bankers staged a protest on Wednesday demanding early wage settlement ahead of their proposed three-day strike in March.

Bankers’ proposed strike on March 11,12 and 13 will lead to a six-day shutdown in banks owing to Holi falling on March 10 and then extending until Sunday March 15.

The six days in a row will adversely hit banking transactions, delay cheque clearances and may leave ATMs dry.

Indore has 641 branches comprising various banks and banking business that is likely to get hit due to strike is about Rs 1.17 lakh crore, claimed bank unions.

MP Bank Employees Association’s chairman M K Shukla said, “Banks will go on a three-day strike in March and this will have a massive impact on banking business.”

Protesting bankers said that unions have decided not to engage in any extra work during the week as a mark of protest which will result in empty ATMs and delayed transactions.

United Forum of Bank Unions (UFBU), an umbrella body of nine unions in the banking sector, has called for the strike in which all public sector banks including State Bank of India will participate. Private banks like ICICI, HDFC and Axis had no participation in the strike.

Before this, bankers were on strike on January 31 and February 1 after wage revision talks with Indian Banks' Association (IBA) failed.

From April 1, 2020, the bank unions have called for an indefinite all-India bank strike if demands are not met.

390,['27/02/2020'],Kamala blaze report: 30% offices not checked,"Blaze in two eateries in Kamala Mills complex that left 14 dead (File photo)

MUMBAI: In the aftermath of the December 2017 blaze in two eateries in Kamala Mills complex that left 14 dead, a civic team appointed to inspect violations at the premises has claimed it could not inspect around 30% of the offices saying they were locked.Municipal sources expressed shock at the reason cited as the BMC has powers to direct owners to unlock offices for inspection. Despite not checking 30% offices and claiming the occupiers did not furnish documents, the committee, set up in 2018, has given a clean chit to mill owners Ramesh Govani and Ravi Bhandari for change of user violations.Over a decade ago, mill owners had taken advantage of the state government’s policy to promote information technology (IT) to redevelop the entire complex. Under the policy, a mill owner could avail of double the construction rights if 80% of the floor space index (FSI) is exclusively used for IT-related purposes. Around 20% of the property was permitted to be used for non-IT purposes. It was alleged that several offices inside the complex were used for non-IT activities.In 2018, the then BMC commissioner Ajoy Mehta formed a three-member committee supervised by the then additional municipal commissioner Vijay Singhal to probe “change of user” and FSI violations in the mill complex. Singhal submitted the report to the current BMC commissioner Praveen Pardeshi earlier this month.The report stated there were FSI violations in 2.4 lakh square feet space where occupiers had illegally amalgamated common areas. It does not mention change of user violations. The report stated FSI violations can be regularized after imposing a penalty if within permissible limit under the new policy.While giving a clean chit, the team reported that non-IT activities were carried out in merely around 15% of the total premises, that is within the permissible limit.While the mill owner told the committee 83% of total built-up area was used for IT activities, the BMC team said it could inspect 54% of the 83% area; the remaining 30% offices were locked.A committee member told TOI the industries department should examine change of user violations. Committee members Jeevan Patgaonkar and R G Patgaonkar refused to comment. An IAS officer said, “The report was expected to point out change of user violations.” Architect Shirish Sukhatme said, “It is inconclusive.”",mumbai,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74328011,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-715978,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/kamala-blaze-report-30-offices-not-checked/articleshow/74325518.cms
391,['27/02/2020'],"Accused of assault, official transferred","This story is from February 27, 2020

Trichy: Regional joint director of collegiate education (RJDCE), Trichy, S Usha, who was accused of physically assaulting subordinate staff two weeks ago, has been posted as the RJDCE of Thanjavur.

Higher education secretary Apoorva passed an order to this effect on Tuesday. T Arivudainambi, RJDCE of Thanjavur has been appointed as the new Trichy RJDCE.

The decision from the higher education department has come under criticism from teachers’ organisations who charged the department of ignoring the safety of its staff at workplace.

On February 13, all the 20 staff at the RJDCE office, Trichy staged a protest alleging that Usha had physically assaulted stenographer Rajeswari and office superintendent Savariyammal Brisca Mary.

Rajeswari, who was allegedly slapped by Usha, was so traumatized that she had to be admitted to a hospital for treatment.

The staff members wrote to the higher education secretary, director of collegiate education and the higher education minister about the incident seeking an inquiry. They also met governor Banwarilal Purohit and submitted a memorandum seeking an inquiry into the incident.

Usha went on forced leave the very next day, and two weeks later she has been transferred to Thanjavur, her home town.

Stating that the decision from the higher education department will set a bad precedence, general secretary of Aided College Teachers Association (ACTA) S Sahaya Sathish said Usha has been demanding a transfer to Thanjavur.

Now, she has been given transfer following the incident, which can only be construed as a reward for her act. There has not been any inquiry into the complaint lodged by the victims, he said.

AUT general secretary M S Balamurugan said that the transfer cannot be considered as punishment, as this is not the first such case against her.

Earlier, there were complaints of verbal abuse by her on staff.

However, no action was taken against her then and she was reinstated to the same post two weeks later.

392,['27/02/2020'],Five Firms To Pump In Rs 2K Cr By Marc,"This story is from February 27, 2020

Indore: An estimated Rs 2,000 crore investment is likely to come on ground from five companies getting operational between February and March in Pithampur, state’s largest industrial belt.

The industry department claims that over Rs 5,000 crore investment will materialise in financial year 2019/20 in Indore region led by pharmaceutical, packaging, automobile and food processing units.

Three pharmaceutical firms have set up manufacturing units in Special Economic Zone (SEZ) while other two companies into furniture fittings and auto parts making have come up in recently denotified areas of Pithampur.

The five companies have collectively proposed to pump in close to Rs 2,000 crore in first phase and expected to generate over 4,000 employment, claimed the industry department.

Madhya Pradesh Industry Development Corporation (MPIDC), Indore head Kumar Purushottam said, “Five big companies are getting operational in February and March. These companies have invested Rs 2,000 crore in the first phase and will expand gradually. Pharmaceutical units in SEZ are rolling on operations to take benefit of the sunset clause getting expired in March.”

Indian origin drug manufacturer Macleods Pharmaceuticals Ltd started operations on Tuesday while German furniture company Hettich started production from Sunday. The United States-based PAR Pharmaceutical has started trial run and likely to be operational before March-end.

Automotive systems suppliers ZF Group has also started trial run while Indian origin Ajanta Pharma is looking to roll into action by March-end.

Purushottam said, “It's not easy to attract industries as there are many in competition but one of the best infrastructure and favorable policies are luring industries in the state and especially in this region that has immense potential and is the most preferred land parcel amongst investors.”

Sunset clause applicable in SEZ restricts tax benefits to only those industries that gets operational before March 2020. Industry associations have been demanding to extend sunset clause as restrictions will hamper fresh investments and job creation.

According to Ministry of Commerce and Industry, companies in SEZ gets 100 per cent Income Tax exemption on export income under Section 10AA of the Income Tax Act for first 5 years, 50 per cent for next 5 years thereafter and 50 per cent on the ploughed back export profit for next 5 years.

393,['27/02/2020'],Resolution against NRC under consideration: CM,"This story is from February 27, 2020

Trichy: The issue of passing a resolution against the National Register of Citizens (NRC) was under consideration of the government, chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswami said. The casual remark came in response to a query from a reporter on whether Tamil Nadu will follow Bihar in passing a resolution against NRC in the assembly.

Bihar is the first NDA state to pass an unanimous resolution against NRC in the assembly on Tuesday and to decide on updating the National Population Register (NPR) according to the 2010 format.

Responding to a question on whether the TN assembly would pass a similar resolution like Bihar where the JD (U) and BJP are in coalition, the chief minister said, “It is all under the government’s consideration”. The NRC is a register of all Indian citizens, mandated by the 2003 amendment of the Citizenship Act, 1955.

CM Palaniswami was in Trichy to inspect the new barrage across Kollidam river in Mukkombu being constructed at a cost of Rs 387.6 crore after a portion of the old structure was washed away by the 2018 floods. Palaniswami had informed the state assembly on January 7 that he had made it clear to Union home minister Amit Shah during a Delhi visit that NRC was not acceptable.

Palaniswami said the Census was a routine exercise carried out once every 10 years, an exercise that began during the colonial rule. The NPR was first introduced by a BJP-led government in 2003, in which the DMK was a constituent too. “It was the UPA government that first implemented the NPR across the country in 2010. Now, the Union government has added three more requirements during the enumeration, such as mother tongue, parent's birth place and any identification card like Aadhaar, family card or voter ID. So, there is now no issue in carrying out NPR"", he said.

Replying to a query on the recent legislation to protect the Cauvery basin, the CM said Trichy and Ariyalur could not be brought into the protected zone as several industries were operating in both the districts.

Replying to a question on withdrawing the cases pending against hundreds of protesters in the delta districts who held agitations against hydrocarbon projects, he said it was under consideration.

NEW DELHI: Congress has put ""family interests above national interest"" by boycotting a banquet given in the honour of US President Donald Trump on Tuesday night at the end of his two-day visit, law minister Ravi Shankar Prasad said.

He said it was odd that Congress could not bring itself to appreciate that the visit of the US President has been a success and furthered India's interests. Alleging Congress boycotted the dinner as its interim president Sonia Gandhi was not extended an invitation, Prasad said BJP's presidents were also not previously invited for similar banquets to honour visiting US presidents George Bush and Barrack Obama when Congress-led UPA was in office.

BJP had not boycotted the events then, he said, noting that Rajnath Singh and Nitin Gadkari were party president in 2006 and 2010 respectively during the Bush and Obama visits.

Prasad noted that Congress leaders Ghulam Nabi Azad and Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury , besides former PM Manmohan Singh were invited for the banquet but Congress functionaries skipped the dinner. The invitation to Chowdhury was extended even though Congress is not formally recognised as the main opposition party while BJP held that status previously.

""Trump's historic visit is over. India-US relations are on a new high. Even here, Congress is doing its petty politics. This has become the party's practice that family interest comes above national interest,"" Prasad said. He said Congress had also kicked up a row over its then president Rahul Gandhi not being given a front row seat during the Republic Day parade.

Trichy: The Velliyanai police arrested a 40-year-old man for sexually assaulting his paramour’s minor daughter in Karur on Wednesday.

The accused, Vimalendran, from Chinnagowndanur in Karur, who is separated from his wife, had sexually assaulted the 16-year-old girl several times.

397,['27/02/2020'],Corona hits drug supply leaving small firms in critical condition,"This story is from February 27, 2020

Indore: The spike in pharmaceutical ingredients amid lockdown in China has hit production of medicines from small drug manufacturers.

Local manufacturers and stockists at Dawa Bazaar have raised concerns over availability of paracetamol, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, antibiotics and medicines for hyper acidity in the market from April-May, if supply restrictions extend.

Unlike better placed and financially sound multinational players to sustain temporary supply disruptions, small-scale drug companies are the worst hit, said industry players.

Dr Subhash Rijhwani, chairman, MP Small-Scale Drug Manufacturers Association said, “Small players have dropped production and are the most-affected due to supply disruption. At present, availability of medicines is normal but if supply continues to remain troublesome, then we may see some crunch from May.”

Indore is a hub for small-scale drug manufacturers with presence of over 120 manufacturing units engaged in production of sanitizers, ointments, syrups and injectables.

Association secretary Amit Chawla said, “I am short of 6 tonne raw material in production. The situation is getting worse each passing day.”

Drug stockists Virendra Sahni said, “We are maintaining a month’s stock and so far, availability is good but if this situation prolongs then there can be some trouble because production is already less locally and transit time from China is no less than a month.”

Dawa Bazaar traders said supply disruption has triggered hoarding by large players that is further squeezing home supplies.

Vinay Bakliwal, president, Indore Chemist Association said, “We have inventories, but they are fast slipping. There is shortage of raw material from China and this has started reflecting in the trade.”

Though, carrying and forwarding agents of multinational companies claim to have sufficient stock and availability in the market.

Sanjay Budhrani, C&F agent supplying drugs to over 20 companies in Indore said, “We have sufficient stock and supplying drugs as demanded in the market. Raw material is available in India also and large companies are not affected at all. The cost factor has definitely gone up but this is not hitting multinationals unlike small drug manufacturers.”

398,['27/02/2020'],"At 13,040 MW, power demand in Telangana soars to new record in five years","This story is from February 27, 2020

Picture used for representational purpose only

HYDERABAD: Telangana set a new record in the last five years in power consumption with the demand soaring to 13,040 megawatt on Tuesday. Senior officials attribute the rise in power demand to rising temperatures across the state in the last few days and farm power requirement going up.

TSTransco officials said thanks to the free 24x7 power supply to the agriculture sector, which began two years ago, the demand had been seeing an upward trend. In Greater Hyderabad, the demand soared to 2,537 MW, which was 200 MW more than the power consumed on the same day last year.

“Of the total power demand, 1,200 MW to 1,300 MW goes into running lift irrigation projects like Kaleshwaram and Kalwakurthy. Also, there are nearly 25 lakh agriculture pumpsets in Telangana,” a senior Transco official said.

Power demand in February is around 9,500 MW. It increases slowly in March with temperatures rising and touches peak demand in mid-summer with usage of air-conditioners going up. Thanks to mercury touching 34-37 degree Celsius in the third week of February this year, the power demand touched the highest 12,780 MW recently.

While power consumption in 2017 summer was between 6,700 MW and 7,000 MW, it hit a high of 8,500 MW in March during peak agriculture season. The demand touched 10,284 MW in March 2018 with the government providing free power to farmers.

In August 2019, the power demand soared to 11,703 MW. Six months later, in January 2020, it touched 11,359 MW. Officials explained that demand for power kept rising since August last year. It may be recalled the mega Kaleshwaram project was inaugurated during this time with about 20 lifts operating.

Though the government is going all out to increase power generation by adding new thermal stations and solar power units, the consumption is equally going up.

Meanwhile, the government has asked all the discoms to ensure uninterrupted supply both for domestic and agriculture purposes. “We are taking steps to provide power without any interruption. TSSPDCL is planning to procure 200 distribution transformers to reduce the load on the existing transformers,” Telangana State Southern Power Distribution Company Limited (TSSPDCL) director (operations) J Srinivas Reddy said.

They allege that despite repetitive instructions, construction companies engaged in the project are dumping debris into Bhagirathi and Yamuna rivers and their supporting streams. They also warned that disturbing the natural course of rivers and streams can cause widespread devastation in the hill districts during monsoons.Suresh Bhai, an activist, told TOI, “Companies engaged in the all-weather road project have not developed proper dumping zones to manage the debris generated from road widening work at Gangotri and Yamunotri highways. Due to this, they are dumping debris into rivers in more than two dozen areas including Dharasu, Badethi Chungi, Matli, and Kuthnor. Further, the dumping zones developed alongside rivers are of no use as most of the retaining walls have got damaged due to over burden of debris.”“It is pity that government agencies are not taking any strict action on the companies which are breaching environmental norms. This is despite one of the companies being penalised Rs 2 crore by the National Green Tribunal in 2018 for violating norms. VK Singh, minister of state for road transport and highways, who recently visited the state, expressed his content with the ongoing works by just doing an aerial survey. This shows government's apathy towards environment,” Suresh Bhai added.Echoing a similar concern, Dwarika Semwal, social activist and secretary of NGO ‘Jadi’, emphasised on “the need for green development in hills.” He said, “Development is important but it should not be done at the cost of environment. Dumping debris in Bhagirathi and Yamuna will not only pollute rivers and affect marine eco-system but also alter the course of rivers which can cause widespread devastation during monsoons.”“Government agencies must develop sufficient dumping zones across construction sites and conduct proper monitoring. Besides, they should also plant trees in dumping zones to reverse the damage”, he added.Meanwhile, Ashish Chauhan, Uttarkashi district magistrate, said, “We have set up a monitoring committee to check that environmental norms are being followed during all-weather road construction works. Besides, we are also following the suggestions of a high-powered committee formed by the Supreme Court.

Bor Tiger Reserve

Nagpur: Selu police have registered an FIR against 8-9 fishermen for allegedly attacking forest staffers who accosted them for fishing in Bor dam during night. The incident occurred on the intervening night of February 23-24.

The earth fill dam on Bor river is a part of the buffer zone of 138sqkm Bor tiger reserve (BTR) in Wardha district. The dam, 60 km from here, is the major source of water for wildlife and birds.

Though the dam belongs to irrigation department, city-based contractor Chandu Patil had bagged fishing rights for which tender was floated by Maharashtra Fisheries Development Corporation (MFDC). Patil has been bagging the contracts since 2016.

According to the FIR, forest guards Premdas Bhakre, Gajanan Sayam, Sunil Dakhore and driver Rahul Patil were patrolling at around 9pm on February 23 when they saw four men near Pardi tower running towards the dam. “When the guards asked them to stop, they fled in three boats. Forest guards seized 150kg nets and two boats. An hour later, the forest staffers saw two boats with at least 8-10 men approaching the dam waters. Sensing trouble, Bhakre intimated other field staff through wireless and asked them to rush to the spot,” said divisional forest officer (DFO) Rahul Gavai.

The two boats came towards the patrolling staff and stopped near the shore. One Parvez Khan countered the staff on seizure of the nets and other material. When the guards asked names of the four persons who had fled the spot earlier, this irked Khan who entered into heated arguments with the staffers and threatened them with dire consequences if they did not allow to take away the nets and other seized material.

Gavai said as the staffers did not allow Khan to take away the seized material, he manhandled forest guard Narayan Kale and tore his shirt. “Not stopping at this, these fishermen pelted stones at the staff in which forest guard Ramesh Raut and Bhakre were injured. We immediately lodged a police complaint on the basis of which an FIR was registered,” said Gavai.

Contrary to forest department’s claim, contractor Patil said, “My men were not involved in fishing at night. They were there to remove some nets which had got stuck.” Patil added, “I agree that fishing should not be done at night, but villagers sneak into the dam waters through forest areas for fishing illegally. The forest staff has no control over them.”

“Being a contractor, I have lodged at least five complaints with Selu police against illegal fishing but both police and the forest staffers have failed to stop the menace due to which I’m suffering huge losses. I’m ready to give up the contract if MFDC refunds my money,” said Patil.

MFDC divisional manager BD Garad said, “This is for the first time such an incident has happened. We will talk to the contractor as it is his responsibility to curb such practices. Night fishing is completely prohibited.”

Trichy: Redeployment of excess teachers from Annamalai University, Chidambaram to three government colleges in Trichy and Pudukottai has created a ruckus as the guest faculty members working in the colleges have been asked to leave the institutions.

Guest faculty members in the recently-converted government arts and science colleges in Lalgudi, Orthanadu and Aranthangi staged a protest seeking reinstatement of the guest staff members who have been asked to leave the colleges.

The director of collegiate education, Chennai has ordered for the redeployment of 39 excess teaching staff from Annamalai University on Tuesday. These teachers have been redeployed in place of vacant posts in colleges, which have been presently being managed by ad hoc teachers for years together.

With the redeployment of the staff, four guest faculty members from Lalgudi college and three each from Orthanadu and Aranthangi colleges have been asked to leave.

One of the guest faculty from Orthanadu college said that she is working as a guest faculty for the last nine years and now suddenly she has been asked to leave the college despite being a qualified teacher.

UGC has mandated that not more than 20% staff members in an institution should be hired on ad hoc, but most of the constituent colleges under Bharathidasan University are run with more than 80% guest faculty members. While we have worked for the development of the college all these years we have been asked to leave all of a sudden, she said. There are more than 200 guest faculty members working in 10 constituent colleges working under Bharathidasan University, among which four have been converted into govenrment colleges recently. TNN

Representative image

NAGPUR: The over one-year-long campaign that was kicked off by a small group of city environmentalists and which fired the green imagination of several passionate citizens came to a victorious end on Wednesday. Though on expected lines as TOI had reported earlier, the case of an unnecessary road through the urban mini forest of Bharat Van got the judicial closure.

The Nagpur bench of Bombay High Court , on Wednesday, disposed of the suo motu public interest litigation (PIL) based on the letter submitted by environmental activist Jaydeep Das. Based on TOI’s reports, Das had written a letter to the court highlighting the adverse impacts of the proposed road.

The move came after the Nagpur Municipal Corporation ( NMC ) rejected MahaMetro’s application seeking felling and transplantation of around 558 trees in Bharat Van.

NMC submitted a document dated January 17 by its garden superintendent where he rejected the permission sought by MahaMetro for the 18-metre road as per city’s development plan (DP). MahaMetro had sought permission for the alternate road on February 1 last year, in view of proposed viewers gallery and tunnel on the banks of Telangkhedi Lake, which would have led to closure of existing road and diversion of traffic.

The civic body informed the court that MahaMetro came out with a revised proposal on September 13 last year, where the proposed tunnel was dropped and, therefore, the alternate road passing through the Bharat Van, which would lead to Maharashtra Jeevan Pradhikaran’s (MJP) office near Telangkhedi Hanuman Temple, wasn’t required for the traffic diversion during construction of the viewers’ gallery.

A division bench comprising justices Ravi Deshpande and Amit Borkar disposed of the PIL after a demand was made by amicus curiae Kartik Shukul and endorsed by senior counsel SK Mishra and others who appeared for respondents like MahaMetro and others.

Soon after the court’s verdict, various groups on WhatsApp that were created for the Save Bharat Van campaign were flooded with celebratory messages. ‘It’s a victory for all of us who care for clean and liveable future. Keep the spirit alive’, ‘The efforts for protecting Bharat Van have set a benchmark about how people’s movement can be mobilized for a noble cause’ and ‘Finally victory is in favour of the environment’ were some messages which were circulated.

Speaking to TOI, Das said, “At a time when religion and caste are dividing the nation, Nagpur has shown how environment and nature can unite people. Save Bharat Van movement has been the first of its kind people's movement against unnecessary and unsustainable practices to destroy nature. It has shown how the power of urban environmentalism can change a policy decision threatening green cover.”

HYDERABAD: Hundreds of students boycotted classes and shut down the Maulana Azad National Urdu University (Manuu) on Wednesday as protests against riots in Delhi that has claimed lives of 22 people so far took hold.

They boycotted internal examinations as a mark of solidarity with those protesting against the Citizenship Amendment Act ( CAA ), National Register of Citizens (NRC) and National Register of Population (NPR) across the country.

Following a ‘university lockdown’ call given by the Manuu students union, students gathered at the main gate and raised slogans of ‘Halla Bol’ and ‘Inquilab Zindabad’.

“We want action against BJP leader Kapil Mishra who is inciting communal hatred and violence in Delhi,” said an angry student even as others burnt his effigy in the evening.

They blamed the BJP and Delhi police for the riots in the capital city.

“We will not be threatened by lathicharge, bullets or imprisonment. Action should also be taken against cops who used force on those protesting against CAA, NRC and NPR,” said Umar Faruq Quadri, president of the Manuu Students Union.

Students also demanded the Telangana government to pass a resolution against CAA, NRC and NPR at the earliest.

Students belonging to University of Hyderabad (UoH) also condemned the violence against anti-CAA protestors and Muslims in Delhi and organised a rally.

“The government is inciting fights among its own citizens in the name of religion. The violence at Delhi, where each person is running for his safety, is an undeclared war on democracy,” said Abhishek Nandan, president of UoH Students Union.

In retaliation, members of Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad, UoH unit, also protested within the campus.

They added that they have also decided to shift several tonnes of refuse-derived fuel (RDF) made from the waste on the site on a daily basis. The site holds around 1.5 lakh metric tonnes of RDF waste.The DMC has also installed a pipeline system to prevent the chemical (released from the RDF) from getting mixed with the nearby Asan river. Earlier, the chemical used to get mixed with the groundwater making it unfit for use. This caused several issues for the local residents. In a spot visit conducted by TOI earlier, it was revealed that the pollutants were getting drained into the river.“We were facing several difficulties in regards to the transportation of the RDF but it has been resolved now. Some cement factories based in Rajasthan are willing to take the RDF from us. Hundreds of tonnes of RDF will be transported to those factories daily. Also, the pipeline system will make sure that the harmful chemical doesn’t get mixed into the river or the groundwater,” said DMC’s chief health officer Kailash Joshi.Notably, the residents of the area around Shishambara plant have been protesting for about four months now. They allege that the condition of their area is getting worse with each passing day. The protesters claim that the groundwater has become so polluted that people who do not have access to RO water are getting afflicted with diseases.“The river and the groundwater have become so contaminated that those who drink tap water complain of neck pain.

405,['27/02/2020'],Century-old government school struggles due to space constraints,"This story is from February 27, 2020

Trichy: Over a century-old Viscountess Goschen government girls ( Muslim ) higher secondary school (VGGGMHSS) in Trichy is struggling for space as students’ strength has gone up to 320 which is double the strength from last year.

Parents Teachers Association (PTA) of the school seek retrieval of half of the school land that was taken away for building minority students hostel to accommodate more number of students.

Started exclusively for girl children, the school had hundreds of children a couple of decades back after which the strength started coming down gradually. The advent of private schools has affected the school strength which came down to 10 in 2005. Finding low strength of the school, then collector of Trichy took half the land of the school to build minority hostel for girls.

Visiting the school on the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi, S Thirunavakkarasu has assured to allocate Rs 10 lakh from his MP local area development fund. Impressed with the work carried out for the education of girl children from the minority community, the MP has also promised to source an additional Rs 10 lakh for constructing of additional school building.

A total of 50 school and college students are staying in the hostel now. And there are 320 students in school now which has increased from 158 in 2018, said Indrani, headmistress of the school. Efforts taken by the HM along with the PTA has led to an increase in the strength of the school, but the existing 10 classrooms have become inadequate to accommodate these many students, said the HM.

We have decided to demolish existing four classrooms operating from over 100-year-old building, but that may not be adequate. Further lack of space has been a major hurdle in the school premises even though the MP has come forward to help with funds, she said.

V M Habibullah, president of parent-teacher association had approached the court in 2005 against taking over of the school land for hostels. But the court justified the decision as the school strength was poor. Now that the strength has increased, we are thinking about approaching the court for retrieval of the land. Students also come from far of places to the city in school vans, he said.

Speaking to TOI, backward classes and minorities welfare officer Kamaraj said that they have not received any communication from the school. ""In case the school comes with the representation on retrieval of the building, we will send their request to the minority welfare department, he said.

MUMBAI: Even as two motorists were recently acquitted by magistrate courts because the pedestrians they knocked down had been jaywalking , the city at present doesn’t have any law to penalize errant pedestrians.The situation is in stark contrast with the developed world. In California, errant pedestrians can be fined $250 for crossing a street between adjacent intersections controlled by signals. And in Singapore, jaywalking attracts a penalty of 50 dollars.In Mumbai, road safety experts say the responsibility should lie with motorists as vehicles are capable of attaining high speeds. According to experts, jaywalking cannot be discussed without taking a critical view of the existing state of pedestrian infrastructure, the aggressive attitude of motorists towards pedestrians, and the priority that police provide to movement of vehicles over the safety of pedestrians. In 2017 and 2018, pedestrians accounted for over 50% of road crash deaths in the city.In 2009, traffic police carried out an extensive campaign to curb jaywalking . Police pounced on pedestrians found jumping dividers near CSMT. Foreign tourists were not spared either. Back then, they followed the Rules of Road Regulations (RRR), notified under the Motor Vehicles Act, which mandated that a driver and every other person should obey automated signals at intersections. Police interpreted “every other person” to include pedestrians and booked jaywalkers.But in 2017, the Motor Vehicles Driving Rules (MDVR), which replaced RRR, brought in a paradigm shift, putting the entire onus on motorists and not pedestrians. “MDVR put a lot of restrictions on drivers while giving the highest priority to pedestrians and cyclists... It recognises that there isn't adequate safety infrastructure in place for pedestrians. It also recognises that pedestrians could get distracted... So, MDVR instructs drivers to practice defensive driving and always be cautious,” said Ranjit Gadgil, programme director of the non-profit, Parisar. Gadgil was among those invited by the parliamentary select committee to give inputs during the process of amending the Motor Vehicles Act.Their hands tied with the MDVR coming into effect, police turned towards the Bombay Police Act to penalize errant pedestrians. The Act empowers the police commissioner to make rules for regulating traffic of all kinds—a notification can be issued spelling out rules for pedestrians. Police did so and started fining errant pedestrians Rs 200. But now, there is no such notification in effect. ""We are exploring the possibility of re-issuing such a notification,” said an official.The Motor Vehicles (Amendment) Act, 2019 empowers states to regulate activities of non-motorised transport and pedestrians. But no rules have been framed for pedestrians under this clause, state transport department officers say.“I’m opposed to the idea of booking pedestrians for jaywalking until we have carefully designed our infrastructure to accommodate needs of all road users. If you really want to save lives, you have to create infrastructure that is forgiving. It stems from an understanding that people will make some mistakes but they shouldn’t have to die for it. In this case, the forgiving factor is speed,” said a transport planner. “Lower speeds in cities equals to increased road safety.”In fact at the third Global Ministerial Conference on Road Safety in Sweden recently, global leaders sought capping of speed limits at 30kmph in areas where vulnerable road users and vehicles mix frequently.",mumbai,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74327111,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-236078,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/safety-onus-entirely-on-motorists-no-rules-to-curb-jaywalking-in-city/articleshow/74326679.cms

A vandalized street following violence between pro and anti-CAA protesters in Delhi (AP photo)

NEW DELHI: On a day when the Supreme Court hauled up Delhi Police for not acting professionally while handling the communal situation in northeast Delhi, former top cops opined the force showed poor judgement about the probability of simmering tensions in the region erupting into full-scale violence.

“It was not a coincidence that the riots broke out during US president Donald Trump’s visit. A large number of well-armed people were on the streets. Where was the police during the build-up?” wondered Prakash Singh, former DGP of UP. Singh, whose report on police reforms was cited by the Supreme Court, said police had failed to gather intelligence when tensions escalated after some provocative speeches.

The retired police chief also charged the senior Delhi Police leadership with failing to take a quick call in containing the situation. “It is imperative for any police force to use arms when they are being used rampantly by rioters. I did not see a single police person armed with a service weapon,” said Singh. What stopped orders to open fire at the armed mob? A lot of lives could have been saved.”

Former Delhi Police commissioner Ajai Raj Sharma was also critical of the brass. “A DCP being beaten up is a shocking sign in policing. When prohibitory orders have been imposed, it is imperative to implement it without compromise,” Sharma said. He recalled a similar situation in UP in the early 1980s. “We aggressively resorted to all sorts of riot control measures because there should be a fear of the law. You cannot expect a rioter to back off. Delhi Police, in this case, seemed to be lacking the intent,” said Sharma.

Some former officers pointed out that the cops appeared to be underprepared to handle the crisis. Ashok Chand, who retired as Delhi Police additional commissioner, linked this with the absence of risk assessment by the cops. “The persons on the ground taking the decisions were clearly not knowledgeable about the topography of the region,” he explained. “It is expected that immediately after violence breaks out, police teams must start area-domination exercises and quick decision-making is essential for this.”

It was not simply the spot decision-making that faltered. As former Delhi Police DCP L N Rao noted, there also was a stark disconnect between the ground force and the senior officers, pointing out that at the Shaheen Bagh protests, the policemen on the ground were clueless until thing went out of control. “In northeast Delhi too, the policemen couldn’t gauge the repercussions of two antagonistic protests coming face to face,” Rao said.

In fact, felt retired additional commissioner SBS Tyagi, apart from having intel and more boots on ground, police should have acted immediately following the provocative speeches last Sunday. “It was evident to anyone that allowing two opposing groups within a stone’s throw of each other would lead to violence. What were police doing when the speeches were being made?” he said. And, the former senior cop added, as soon as the riots broke out, Delhi Police should have immediately started arresting the perpetrators to instil a fear among the rioters. This could have helped defuse the situation.

KOLHAPUR: The Gandhinagar police have put a signboard outside the police station appealing people to approach them and register complaints if they are harassed by private money lenders.

The appeal comes in the wake of the incident in which a farmer allegedly attempted suicide by consuming pesticide after he was unable to clear dues of a private money lender despite attaching his agricultural land on the name of money lender. Police said that the farmer is currently admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) and is undergoing treatment.

Prashant Amruktar, deputy superintendent of police, Karveer division, said, “We have already appealed to the people to come forward and register complaints against private money lenders with us so that we can crack whip against them. As a part of our drive to reach out to people and build confidence in them about our assurance, we have put a signboard outside the Gandhinagar police station. We expect people to approach us for any help, especially if they are being harassed by private money lenders.”

Gandhinagar is a major wholesale market area. Hundreds of traders and businessmen have their outlets and shops in Gandhinagar.

“Gandhinagar is one of the regions in Kolhapur district where illegal activities like private moneylending is deep rooted, creating fear among the traders working here. Our aim is to weed out private moneylending and extortion crimes from this area. This is one of the reason that we have chosen to put board at Gandhinagar police station so that the traders will come forward and register complaints with us,” Amruktar said.

He also said that recent incidents have revealed that these private money lenders operate in gangs and resort to kidnapping and extortion to recover their interest. “We have already invoked Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act (MCOCA) against some gangs that were found operating as private money lenders in this region. We will take action against the remaining ones after people come forward and register complaints with us,” he added.

Representaive Image

KARUR: A police writer attached to Velayuthampalayam police station in Karur was caught red-handed by vigilance and anti-corruption (DVAC) officials, while taking a bribe of Rs 15,000 from a man in Karur on Wednesday. He had to pay the bribe for moving a file on his car that was involved in a traffic accident. The DVAC also booked the inspector of the police station for his alleged involvement in the incident.

Senthilkumar, 44, is the official caught red-handed while receiving money from Abhishek, the owner of the car. The waiting DVAC team surrounded Senthilkumar and took him into custody.

A multi utility vehicle (MUV) of Abhishek collided with another car on the bypass road on February 16. Velayuthampalayam police registered a case after booking the driver of the car as the accused in the case. As per the procedure, the car should be referred to the motor vehicle inspector (MVI) at RTO for verification. The verification can be done at the recommendation of the police officer concerned.

Initially, Senthilkumar demanded Rs 20,000 from Abhishek for moving his file. As Abhishek refused the amount, Senthilkumar settled the deal for Rs 15,000. Unwilling to bribe him, Abhishek filed a complaint with DVAC, Karur, which laid a trap.

After the arrest, Senthilkumar told police that he took the bribe at the behest of police inspector Veluchamy. Recording his statement, DVAC implicated inspector Veluchamy also in the case. Since the inspector was unavailable at the police station on Wednesday, DVAC have planned to summon him for further inquiry.

After searching Senthilkumar’s residence at the police quarters, the DVAC produced him before a court. The court remanded him in judicial custody and he is sent to Trichy central prison.

Pinarayi Vijayan

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan , on Saturday, will officially announce completion of the construction of two lakh houses for homeless under Life Mission , which the government considers as an ‘unparalleled achievement’ in a short span of time.

The government, since the launch of Life Mission (bringing all existing housing schemes under one umbrella) in 2017, has spent around Rs 6,500 crore for works under the three-phased project and has so far completed construction of around 2.14 lakh houses, LSGD minister A C Moideen told reporters here on Wednesday. Thiruvananthapuram district topped in the number of houses constructed (32,388) followed by Palakkad (24,898) and Kollam (18,470).

Around 30,000 beneficiaries are expected to take part in the mega function to be held at Putharikkandam Maidan at 3pm on Saturday, said general committee chairman and cooperation minister Kadakampally Surendran. Besides the main event in the capital, panchayat-level programmes with the participation of beneficiaries are being organized across the state simultaneously.

Elaborating on the three phases of the project, Moideen said an amount of Rs 670 crore was spent to construct 52,050 houses (of total 54,173) in the first phase, which dealt with houses remaining incomplete under various government schemes during the period from 2000-01 to 2015-16.

The second phase targeted homeless people who owned land, and the government has so far spent Rs 5,851.23 crore. “Houses of 74,674 (80.97%) beneficiaries were completed. Out of the 17,475 houses for which construction began under Life-PMAY (rural), 16,640 houses have been completed,” the minister said.

The mission has also identified 1,06,925 beneficiaries under the third phase (house for landless people), which would feature construction of housing complexes using prefab technology. The government has spent Rs 31 crore besides giving administrative sanction for works estimated at Rs 448 crore for the third phase, the minister added.

HYDERABAD: Despite severe financial constraints and economic slowdown, the state government will distribute Bathukamma saris to about one crore women. This will be the fourth successive year that the TRS government will be distributing Bathukamma saris to women of above 18 years having white ration cards.

Officials said the scheme would cost Rs 320 crore to the government. The officials have already placed orders with powerloom weavers, particularly those working in Sircilla, represented by TRS working president and industry minister KT Rama Rao in the assembly.

Each sari will cost about Rs 300. They will be distributed for free to women before the Bathukamma festival. Sources said one crore saris made of polyester with attractive golden and silver colour border would be distributed.

Officials consulted design experts, took feedback from rural and urban women before finalising the designs for the saris.

Over 40,000 weaver families working in the powerloom sector will benefit from the government order for these saris. Telangana State Handloom Weavers Cooperative Society Ltd managing director P Yadagiri told TOI that the government had been giving nearly Rs 500 crore worth work orders every year to the weavers for production of saris, uniforms, among others.

Upon the directions of KTR , orders for production of school uniforms for students of SC, ST and BC welfare residential schools, Ramzan and Christmas gifts comprising saris, kurta-pyjama and trouser-shirt are also being given to the powerloom weavers in the last few years, officials said.

“This is being done to give work to the weavers facilitating revival of the weaving industry,” an official said.

Asaduddin Owaisi

HYDERABAD: Accusing the BJP of inciting communal tension in Delhi, AIMIM chief Asaduddin Owaisi on Wednesday said clashes in the capital city brought back memories of the 2002 Gujarat riots .

“The whole world has seen how the Delhi police were complicit in the whole communal carnage that took place. I will not call it a communal riot, but it is a deliberate programme, and it reminds the nation of what happened in 2002,” said Owaisi on Wednesday in Hyderabad.

Continuing his verbal attack on BJP and Delhi police, Owaisi said: “I want to ask the honourable Prime Minister, is this your Sab Ka Saath Sab Ka Vikas? Your chief minister says, to be in India you have to say this slogan, who are you to judge my loyalty towards nation? This very thinking has gone down to the level of police officers,” said Owaisi, referring to a video where four inured people were singing the national anthem in the presence of cops.

An angry Owaisi questioned how cops allowed a group of people to go near a place of worship and said the Army should be pressed into action as people did not have any faith in the police.

“The worst part was people clapping when the whole tyre market was burnt. Army should be brought in as Delhi police is complicit in this matter,” said the Hyderabad MP.

He took potshots at Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Union home minister Amit Shah and MoS (home) Kishan Reddy.

“Neither the PM OR HM has reacted to this, and are only holding meetings. Why can’t they condemn it an outright manner? Why can’t union home minster visit the areas (where violence erupted), why can’t his MOS go? he (MOS) sits in Hyderabad and criticises me,” said the lawmaker.

“Why can’t HM visit all these areas, when HM can camp for four days continuously and hold more 30 public meetings ahead of Delhi elections, why can’t he go now?” he added.

He also said that the responsibility of not controlling this communal riot lies with the BJP government at the centre.

“It is the failure of the BJP government. The central government is deliberately not acting, many journalists have been attacked too,” said Owaisi.

HYDERABAD: A mere 5% length of the total road network spanning across the country causes 55.33% road accidents and leads to 62.50% deaths. This was in 2018. In a damning report to the Bureau of Police Research and Development (BPRD), it was also said that India alone accounts for 11% of total road accident-related deaths in the world.The report titled ‘Road safety scenario and national road safety plan’ was submitted to BPRD by chairman of Telangana Road Safety Authority and DGP (road safety) T Krishna Prasad. Towards preventing road accidents on national highways (NHs) and state highways (SHs), Prasad suggested formation of special police agency for highways apart from safety plan. BPRD functions under the ministry of home affairs.“The dedicated NH and SH safety police should focus 60% of their energies on enforcement, 20% on educating commuters and awareness programmes and remaining 20% on emergency response,” Prasad told TOI on Wednesday. He said safety police and local cops should work in tandem to prevent road accidents.Prasad, who submitted his report on Tuesday, focused on strategy for road crash fatality prevention. BPRD had asked for report on road safety six months ago. “India ranks first in number of road accident deaths as per World Road Statistics, 2018, followed by China and the US,” he said.Since NHs carry more than 40% of traffic load, enforcement must be on NHs, he said. “If it is done within five years, fatalities caused by accidents on NHs will come down by at least 50%. Standard operating procedures and legal provisions should also be outlined for new police agency,” he observed.In the wake of an accident in Karimnagar where a car plunged into canal and three of a family drowned, all district collectors and SPs have been asked to identify vulnerable spots in coordination with R&B department.

Representative image

NAGPUR: Navi Mumbai is the most toxic city in the state and 51st most polluted in the world, reveals the latest World Air Quality Report 2019. According to it, Nagpur’s air is the second-most toxic in the state.

Track the pollution level in your city

The report is based on the latest data from government and private continuous ambient air quality monitoring stations and compiled by IQAir Air Visual – a global air quality information platform. It reveals the changing state of particulate matter 2.5 around the world last year.

Globally, India ranks fifth in the polluted countries across the world, with an annual PM2.5 concentration of 58.1 micrograms per cubic meter (mpcm). PM2.5 is a deadly pollutant which measures up to 2.5 microns. Due to its microscopic size, the particles can enter the bloodstream through the respiratory system, leading to severe health impacts.

Of the 11 cities from Maharashtra which are listed under polluted cities, annual PM2.5 levels of Navi Mumbai in 2019 are the highest at 61.6 mpcm. The pollutant’s concentration exceeded the World Health Organization’s (WHO) safe target of 10 mpcm by nearly 500%.

Nagpur, the state’s second most toxic city, breaches this standard by nearly 400%, with an annual PM2.5 average of 47.2 mpcm. Other cities from the state which recorded high PM2.5 levels include Mumbai, Aurangabad, Nashik, Solapur, Pimpi-Chinchwad, Pune, Chandrapur, Kupti (Nanded district) and Kumbhori (Pune district).

According to experts, different combustion processes are the main contributors for particulate pollution . “Thermal power plants, open burning and landfill fires of municipal solid waste, commercial food sector and vehicular emissions are some prominent sources,” said Avinash Chanchal, senior campaigner at Greenpeace India.

As reported by TOI, Maharashtra, at 18, has the highest number of non-attainment cities in the country. In the National Clean Air Programme (NCAP), the Union environment ministry categorized 102 cities as ‘non-attainment’. It meant these cities have consistently witnessed deteriorating air quality when compared to the National Ambient Air Quality Standards.

Stating that the government needs to address major sources of pollution which are prevalent throughout the year, Chanchal said, “It needs to ensure that the growing demand for energy is fuelled by sustainable and cleaner sources. The policymakers also need to introduce measures to phase out from petrol and diesel cars and build a more equipped public transport system.”

Chancal added that the city clean air action plan should include sectoral targets and policies for emission reduction with interim milestones to track half-yearly and annual progress.

419,['27/02/2020'],Barrage repair work may cost 3-4 days water cut: WRD,"This story is from February 27, 2020

The barrage was constructed twenty years ago, however, two of the 20 columns have been completely damaged

KOLHAPUR: The water resource department (WRD) officials have suggested to the Kolhapur Municipal Corporation (KMC) to stop the water supply to the city for three to four days to repair the barrage at Shinganapur pumping station located along the Panchganga river.

The barrage was constructed twenty years ago, however, two of the 20 columns have been completely damaged. The KMC had earlier floated the tenders inviting the firms to take up the repair works on several occasions, however, it did not receive an adequate response. The civic body, therefore, approached the WRD officials asking them to provide the contractor from their panel to get the work done before the arrival of monsoon.

A senior WRD official on condition of anonymity said that the repair work of the barrage requires complete drying of the river site for at least three to four days. “We have visited the site recently. The ready-mix concrete foundation has to be laid. The suggestion has been made to the KMC, however, we are yet to get the response. The repairs are important and if it is neglected the rest of the structure may get damaged and then it will be hard to get the new one constructed.”

According to the WRD officials, around 50% of the water reserved for the city is lost through various leakages. The damage to the barrage has further added to the leaking woes.

Last year, the KMC had set aside Rs 40 lakh for the work but the cost for the repair work would have increased. Due to the leakages, the water level at the barrage is not maintained at the level required to operate the pumps at full capacity.

This has lead to inadequate supply to the E ward and some other areas of the city, which forms around 60% of the total population. The capacity of the pumps is around 86 million litres however the supply is just 50%.

When questioned to the recommendation made by the WRD, a senior water supply official said, “It is not practical to stop the water supply for three to four days. We are finding other ways to get the columns repaired. To cut the water supply for the longer duration we have to take the citizens, corporators into confidence.”

CHARMINAR: Flash protests, candlelight vigil and demonstrations were held in parts of Old City on Wednesday night againstthe Citizenship Amendment Act ( CAA ), National Population Register (NPR) and National Register of Citizens (NRC).

Protesters gathered on the streets at Tolichowki, Yakutpura, and Hussaini Alam holding the National flag, placards and candles to raise their voice against the controversial Act implemented by the central government as well as mass detention of agitators by the city police. They also condemned the violence in Delhi.

“The women are taking out a peaceful rally and yet cops are trying to push us away. They are trying to suppress public voice and the government is silent. We urge the chief minister to take a clear stand on Citizenship Amendment Act,” said a protester at Yakutpura.

Students of Nizamia Tibbi College also demanded that the government should make its stand on the contentious law clear without any delay. “We began our protest 51 days ago and will continue our agitation till our demands are met,” said a student.

Similarly, blackout demonstrations were organised by traders at Chatta Bazaar and Barkas as well as Chandrayangutta Market between 7.15pm and 7.30 pm. The traders switched off the lights in their respective shops for 15 minutes as part of the protest.

“We have been organising blackout protests regularly and the agitation will continue till the demands are met,” a shopkeeper told TOI.

423,['27/02/2020'],VMRDA picks 7 mandals to develop 1-cent housing sites,"This story is from February 27, 2020

Visakhapatnam: Visakhapatnam Metropolitan Region Development Authority (VMRDA) is racing against time to prepare one-cent layouts for distribution to the homeless in Vizag city starting this Ugadi. Even though the land pooling exercise is being carried out in 10 mandals in the district for nearly 6,100 acres, officials have identified about 2,867 acres in seven mandals out of the pooled land to develop the housing sites for 1.54 lakh beneficiaries.

About 58,861 beneficiaries will be given one-cent plots in Sabbavaram mandal alone, including Gollapalem village (15,108 plots), Nanginarapadu (11,936), Yerukunaidupalem (3,363), Pydiwada (9,953) and Gangavaram (18,501). Housing sites will be allocated to nearly 38,000 families in Thangudubilli, Gandigundam and Ramavaram villages in Anandapuram mandal.

About 20,187 plots will be provided to the homeless in Mudapaka mandal. Nearly 13,000 housing sites will be developed in various villages of Parawada mandal. Other layouts will come up in Gajuwaka, Anakapalli and Pedagantyada mandal.

Visakhapatnam Metropolitan Region Development Authority estimates that basic infrastructural development works, including jungle clearance, site levelling, total station survey and peg marking with stones for the one cent plots, would cost the exchequer about Rs 57 crore. VMRDA called for tenders for the same two days ago. Civil works at these layouts are expected to begin around March 10 after finalising bidders. Visakhapatnam Metropolitan Region Development Authority metropolitan commissioner P Koteswara Rao said VMRDA engineering officials will prepare a daily report on the ongoing works at various layouts.

“VMRDA officials were asked to work in a coordinated manner to complete the works within the stipulated deadline to facilitate distribution of the housing sites to the poor,” said Koteswara Rao. VMRDA will get nearly 900 acres as its share out of the pooled land in compensation for the development of these one-cent layouts. The farmers (assignees/encroachers) will also be provided developed plots. But the size of the plots will be based on the legitimacy of possession and tenure.

While the development of one-cent layouts is estimated to cost about Rs 2 lakh per acre, expenditure on the layout development towards farmers’ share as well as VMRDA’s share is likely to hover around Rs 50 lakh per acre.

424,['27/02/2020'],MLA Thakre demands action against Sadar cops,"This story is from February 27, 2020

Vikas Thakre

Nagpur: West Nagpur Congress MLA Vikas Thakre on Wednesday criticized the city police for non-registration of FIR in cases pertaining to women. While speaking in the state assembly on Wednesday, he also demanded strict and exemplary action against erring officials.

Referring to an incident of Sadar police station on February 16, Thakre highlighted the plight of two sisters who were turned away by night officer API Mohan Dere without initiating any proper action. The husband of one sister had thrashed both under the influence of liquor. No medical examination too was conducted.

The women, who reached the police station at midnight, were rudely turned away. They were also told to get the medical examination done on their own from any hospital of their choice.

No action was initiated until Thakre intervened the following morning. The women were then sent for a medical examination at Mayo hospital. On February 18, they were given a copy of the non-cognizable offence registered against the husband.

Thakre expressed shock how women who wanted protection and justice at such an odd hour were sent away by the police.

Speaking to TOI, Thakre asked an offence should have been registered “without his intervention”.

State home minister Anil Deshmukh, responding to Thakre, said that he would ensure strict action is initiated against the accused once a detailed complaint is submitted. “We already have crime and criminal tracking network and system (CCTNS) in place which have made it possible to register complaint online. Also, every police station across the state would be covered under surveillance of six CCTV cameras. These systems would help us keep a check on the functioning of the police stations and also ensure that there ills like non-registration of FIRs are being monitored,” he said.

PI Amol Deshmukh, who was in-charge of the Sadar police station between February 14 and 18, said he was clueless about the incident.

Senior PI Mahesh Bansod of Sadar police station said the doctor at Mayo hospital had stated in his report that there was no fracture on the women’s hand. “One of them had declined to get the medical examination done but underwent one on our insistence. Neither had any serious injuries,” he said, adding that even the husband had lodged a counter-complaint.

CP BK Upadhyay said the entire matter would be thoroughly probed now. “Action would be initiated against anyone who may have failed to act,” he said.

More than 100 cars were torched

NEW DELHI: Six kilometres from the battle zone of Jafrabad-Maujpur lies Shiv Vihar in Karawal Nagar. The riots have so affected the locals that children showed reporters on Wednesday messages from their own friends taunting them to attack or back off. Amid smouldering houses and shops were also those that had been abandoned by frightened residents.

The magnitude of the hostility was clearly visible at the two paid parking lots near the Shiv temple. More than 100 cars there had been torched. An RAF official said, “Rioting took place throughout the night. Obviously, the mob had large amounts of arson material.” Anuj Sharma alleged that the skirmish began with stones being thrown at the temple in the area. “We pushed the mob back but they burnt the cars in the parking lot,” he claimed.

The destruction in this area abutting the Loni borde with UP is horrifying. TOI found many shops still aflame around 2.30pm on Wednesday. Sonu and his five brothers were combing the charred remains of their Radhe Radhe Confectionery Shop. “Hindus and Muslims both ate from our shop. We had no enmity with anyone. How will our families survive now with everything gone?” despaired Sonu, showing currency notes worth Rs 2,700 currency — the only remaining wealth of the family. Three fire tenders were trying to extinguish blazes in at least two locations.

The Rapid Action Force was clearly dominating the area, but unlike in Maujpur, Kabir Nagar, Jafrabad and Ghonda, no one in Shiv Vihar ventured out on the roads, which were strewn with rubble, stones and bricks. People sat at lane entrances with bamboo staves to deter anyone from going afield even as community elders sat outside places of worship trying to coax the residents into normality. As in Jafrabad, here too a canal divides the areas where the two communities have lived in harmony for decades.

Though the violence has abated, the tension hasn’t. Mohammad Azeem, an air conditioner repairman, recalled a sleepless night. “The area was quiet and we tried to sleep. But at 4am we heard a big blast. We ran to the terrace to see a ball of fire. Some women residents made frantic calls for help when their houses caught fire. We took the help of police to rescue them,” he said.

Basheer Ahmed, who works in Ghaziabad, worried about loss of income. “We are unable to go for work and I don’t know how I will sustain my family if this continues for long,” he said.

The elderly Mohammed Ikrammudin said he had experienced no disharmony in the 25 years he has lived here. “The perpetrators have come from outside, from UP. Their accents are different,” he alleged. Mohammad Umar said that rioters had used gas cylinders during the attack on homes and shops, including two mosques.

JANGAON: Ensuring basic amenities in towns and a plan to meet future demands is the main objective of Pattana Pragathi programme, the brainchild of chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao, municipal administration and urban development minister KT Rama Rao said on Wednesday.

During a surprise visit to Jangaon district on Wednesday, KTR inspected the progress of Pattana Pragathi programme at Dharmakancha basti . He said that the onus is on councillors and civic officials to bring a visible change in the towns, especially in regard with greenery and cleanliness. “As per the new Municipal Act, councillors will be held responsible if they fail to ensure greenery in their areas. They need to achieve at least 85% survival rate of plants,” KTR said.

The TRS working president also interacted with the sanitation workers and they told KTR about the problems they are facing. He directed district collector K Nikhila to resolve the issues faced by the sanitation workers.

Talking about garbage collection in the town, KTR told the municipal officials to procure Swachh autos and directed them to create awareness about the importance of segregating waste. The officials were also told to penalise residents if they dispose garbage on roads.

KTR further directed the officials to ensure that land owners keep their vacant plots clean or else they should be fined. The minister instructed officials to go tough on realtors who are resorting to illegal layouts.

He said that the 10-day Pattana Pragathi programme should become a platform to start construction of vegetable and non-vegetarian market yards, parks, open gyms, public toilets for women and men.

“Currently, if a university has to introduce a new course, it should first send a proposal to the Board of Studies following which it has to be approved by the higher education department,” Ranjan said, adding that a mechanism needs to be outlined in the draft PPTE to streamline introduction of new courses.

Stakeholders also emphasised on the need to have greater industry-academic collaborations to encourage apprenticeships. “Every institution should have two members from the industry on board who can guide students on apprenticeships,” said BVR Mohan Reddy, chairman of IIT-Hyderabad and executive chairman of Cyient Ltd.

KOLHAPUR: The Kolhapur Municipal Corporation (KMC) has issued notices to the government establishments asking them to clear the water tax dues totalling more than Rs 17 crore.

Meanwhile, the civic body has paid Rs 2 crore to the water resources department towards the water lifted from Panchganga river. However, the total principal amount of Rs 13 crore is pending.

Recently, the Chhatrapati Pramila Raje Civil Hospital, which has total dues of Rs 7 crore, made part payment after the KMC threatened to cut its water supply. The railways have Rs 6.52 crore dues.

The total dues of the water supply department are Rs 28 crore and most of them are with the government establishments such as educational institutes, offices of government departments.

A senior KMC official said that while the government establishments pay the bills of other services such as power, bills, fuel, however they do not pay the water tax bills regularly.

Prashant Pandat, water tax superintendent of KMC, said, “We have issued show-cause notices. Soon, we are going to meet the top officers and request them to pay the dues. We have more dues with the government departments than with the citizens. The poor revenue collection has severely affected the KMC’s finances.”

Pandat said that the KMC cannot disconnect the water supply to the government offices suddenly since most of the establishments, especially the hospitals, have a number of visitors.

The KMC had sought concession in the bills issued by the water resources department. Along with the principal amount of dues and the fine, the total dues with the KMC is around Rs 35 crore. The WRD officials claimed that many other local bodies pay the bills regularly and even the farmers for using water from Panchganga river, the KMC has not been able to pay the dues.

Rohit Bandivdekar, executive engineer of WRD, said, “The demand of KMC to waive the fine amount and provide concession in the bills has been rejected by Maharashtra River Water Regulatory Authority. We have time and again told KMC to recover the dues from the consumers regularly and improve the supply system.”

430,['27/02/2020'],Road contractor JP Enterprises blacklisted for shoddy work,"This story is from February 27, 2020

Nagpur: The Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) has blacklisted Mumbai-based JP Enterprises for poor quality work as well as delay in completing the project under Cement Concrete Road Phase-III Project. It is for the first time in NMC’s history that a contractor has been blacklisted for this reason.

Municipal commissioner Tukaram Mundhe on Wednesday issued orders for JP Enterprises to be blacklisted for a year and also slapped a fine of Rs8.11 lakhs on the firm.

JP Enterprises was to construct roads (package-8 under phase-III) covering Ekstambh Square to North Ambazari Road (road in front of Children Traffic Park) and Ekstambh Square to Zenda Chowk to Coffee House Square to Ram Nagar-Ravi Nagar Road.

Few months ago, NGO Civic Action Guild (CAG) had lodged a complaint with the then municipal commissioner Abhijit Bangar alleging poor quality of works in construction of footpath and laying of paver blocks on both sides of Ekstambh Square to North Ambazari Road.

CAG claimed that the paver blocks came out immediately after they were fitted. The NGO had also said paver blocks were placed without ensuring proper curing of cement concrete.

Bangar had ordered an inquiry which found quality of paver blocks and other works not as per tender conditions.

Two days after Mundhe assumed charge as municipal commissioner, he received the inquiry report. He issued notices to the contractor, project management consultant M/s Creations Engineers Private Ltd and NMC junior engineer Gajendra Shrivastav.

After receiving replies from all, Mundhe on Wednesday took action. Earlier, the contractors would be ‘excused’ whenever such inquiries were conducted. But Mundhe decided to blacklist the contractor. What action has been taken against Creations Engineers Private Ltd and Shrivastav could not be ascertained.

Despite the deadline of March 31, the contractor is yet to complete main cement concrete works between Ekstambh Square and Zenda Chowk. Various other works too are pending. The total cost of the package is Rs32.47 crore.

The contractor will now have to complete remaining works but will not get any new work from the NMC in the next one year.

NMC sources told TOI that Mundhe blacklisted JP Enterprises to send a warning bell to all contractors engaged in road works.

The NMC’s cement concrete road phase-I of Rs133 crore, phase-II of Rs324 crore and phase-III of Rs302 crore are replete with poor quality works and inordinate delay.

Many roads concretized under first two phases have developed cracks along with scaling of surface layer. Quality of paver blocks, footpaths, road-divider too are of shoddy quality. No action has been taken against any contractor in last nine years.

RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat, along with various spiritual heads, hailed late P Parameshwaran in Thiruvananthapuram... Read More

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Recalling his long association with RSS ideologue P Parameswaran who passed away last week, RSS sarsangh chalak Mohan Bhagwat here, on Wednesday, said Parameswaran was a model swayam sewak who very much like Dr Hedgewar would ever continue as a living presence.

“I used to keep regular touch with him. In the last seven years I made it a point to meet him every year, once at least. As someone rightly mentioned, he was an Ajathasathru; the one who has no enemies. He never harboured enmity towards anybody. Such a simple and erudite person, he spoke in short simple sentences. He was an embodiment of all nine qualities that a swayam sewak should aspire for. He has the strength, character and knowledge. He was a fighter who pursued his goal astutely. He is an example for how each sangh member should conduct one self,” he said.

Bhagawat said Parameswaran had enlightened him about the crux of Bhagawat Gita in simple sentences. “Once I had an occasion to ask him how we can talk in brief about Gita. He explained it to me in four or five sentences. First, don’t try to avoid problems in life. Second, don’t think about how difficult the challenges are ahead. Then, whatever you do, do it with love. Don’t fight because you hate, fight because you love. Fight because you are on the right side. Then, whatever the result, learn to distance oneself away from that. Parameswarji had told me. He could practise all these,” he said.

Incidentally, Bhagawat’s reference about the gist of Bhagavad Gita prompted many to draw a connection between the riot in Delhi and the claims about the glory associated with those fighting on the right side.

KOLHAPUR: The Kolhapur city and district citizens’ action committee has opposed state government ’s move of rationalising schools that have less than 20 students.

According to the committee members, due to this decision as many as 58 schools in the district will be merged and students will be transferred to other schools.

Ramesh More, member of the action committee, said the state government in its government resolution on February 20 has skillfully managed to avoid the mention of closure of schools in the name of rationalisation and providing transport allowance to the affected students.

“We will not tolerate closure of any school in the district even if there are less than 10 students studying in them. Education is the right of every child and nobody should be deprived of it,” he said, adding that they met the Kolhapur zilla parishad Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Aman Mittal regarding the issue and he has promised to look into the matter.

When contacted, Mittal said, “The GR does not mention closure of any school. But this has been observed that in many places there are two-three schools that need to be rationalised.”

He added that if there are no schools in the standard vicinity — 1-km for primary and 3-km for upper primary — the schools will not be merged and students will continue their education in that school only.

“I want to assure everyone that all schools in remote areas having less than 10 or 20 students will continue to operate,” he said.

433,['27/02/2020'],Salinity threatens Kuttanad paddy yields,"This story is from February 27, 2020

Alappuzha: Saline water intrusion into Vembanad Lake from the sea is posing a threat to the paddy crops of Kuttanad which are below sea level.

The presence of salinity of more than 2PPT (a measurement to check the presence of salt in 1kg of water) will destroy the paddy and will reduce the weight and quality of the crops.

Tinto K Edayadi, a farmer said that he had conducted puncha cultivation on 35 acres and his paddy is 80 days old. “So, if salinity increases, all my plans will get derailed. My paddy will get destroyed and the salinity level in my paddy fields are nearing 2PPT. Uma seeds will not survive more than this limit. We are expecting 2,000-2,500kg paddy per acre. But if salinity level increases, it will come down to 1,500-1,800kg. The paddy crops which covers 100 days, can only survive the salinity levels of 2PPT,” he said.

According to farmers, though the shutters of Thanneermukkom bund were closed for preventing arrival of seawater to Kuttanad, the saline water keeps entering Vembanad Lake. “The water level in Kuttanad ips continuously depleting. Kollam-Kottappuram inland waterway and canals like Pookaitha that are connected to the sea though various water bodies are some of the major mediums for the arrival of saline water to Kuttanad,” the farmers said.

District Congress committee president M Liju said that the presence of salinity should be reduced in paddy fields of Kuttanad by opening the shutters of Pamba Dam. “If fresh water comes to the paddy fields, the salinity level will reduce. Liju has sent a letter in this regard to chief minister, ministers and officials concerned. The paddy crops in 270 acres is getting destroyed in Veeyapuram panchayat of upper Kuttanad due to the intrusion of saline water,” he said.

The ‘puncha’ harvesting of Kuttanad began last week. The paddy harvesting will come into full swing by March. The harvesting is getting delayed in many paddy fields as sowing in several areas was done behind the schedule due to rain and a shortage of seeds.

Kuttanad peasants of 1,217 ‘padasekhara samithi’, famous for bio saline farming, have indulged in ‘puncha’ farming in 26,268 hectares.

A farmer needs 50 to 60 kg seeds per acre for ‘puncha’ farming. The cost of one kg of seeds was Rs 32 and the state government distributed 40kg of seeds to the farmers free of cost. The remaining seeds were bought by the farmers spending their own cash.

NEW DELHI: The government on Wednesday approved setting up of a National Technical Textiles Mission with a total outlay of Rs 1,480 crore. The mission will have a four-year implementation period from 2020-21 to 2023-24.

“The mission will aim at average growth rate of 15-20% per annum taking the level of domestic market size to $40-50 billion by the year 2024 through market development, market promotion, international technical collaborations, investment promotions and ‘ Make in India ’ initiatives,” an official statement said.

Technical textiles are futuristic and niche segment of textiles, which are used for various applications ranging from agriculture, roads, railway tracks, sportswear, healthcare, bullet proof jackets, fire proof jackets, high altitude combat gear and space applications.

The use of technical textiles in agriculture, aquaculture, dairy, poultry, Jal Jivan Mission, Swachch Bharat Mission, Ayushman Bharat will bring an overall improvement in cost economy, water and soil conservation, better agricultural productivity and higher income to farmers per acre of land holding in addition to promotion of manufacturing and exports activities in India, the government said.

The mission envisages export promotion of technical textiles, enhancing it from the current annual value of approximately Rs 14,000 crore to Rs 20,000 crore by 2021-22, and ensuring 10% average growth in exports per year up to 2023-24.

In India, the segment is estimated at $16 billion (about Rs 1.14 lakh crore) which is approximately 6% of the $250 billion (about Rs 17.75 lakh crore) global technical textiles market . The penetration level of technical textiles is low in India, varying between 5-10% against the level of 30-70% in developed countries.

Talking to reporters, Union textiles minister Smriti Irani said arrangements have been made under the mission for skill development of 50,000 people in the field of technical textiles. “We have mandated use of technical textiles in nine ministries and 92 products and our hope is that with convergence of efforts with the technology group we will see a new future for especially MSME and technologists in the field of technical textiles, thereby making India self sufficient specially in strategic fields like defence and aerospace,” she said.

The minister said that the trade deficit in this segment will be nullified in the next one year.

According to an official release, the mission will have four components including research, innovation and development with outlay of Rs 1,000 crore; promotion and market development; export promotion; education, training and skill development.

436,['27/02/2020'],Experts sound alarm over unscientific &amp; reckless methods of fishing in Telangana and Andhra Pradesh,"This story is from February 27, 2020

One of the major reasons of the decline is being attributed to unscientific and reckless methods of fishing

HYDERABAD: A serious decline in fish catch across Telangana and Andhra Pradesh since last monsoon has got experts worried. Besides climate change, one of the major reasons of the decline is being attributed to unscientific and reckless methods of fishing .

M Vijay Gupta, fisheries scientist, told TOI, “In trolling, which is widely used in Telangana and Andhra Pradesh, one or more fishing lines, baited with lures are drawn through the water in small and large water bodies alike. This results in trapping a large number of unintended species.”

Experts said that wherever there is such kind of fishing, there is a by-catch, the incidental capture of non-target species such as sharks, marine turtles, sea birds, and in some areas, dolphins.

The National Fisheries Development Board (NFDB), Hyderabad has been long running schemes to encourage fishermen to switch from conventional fishing techniques (trawl fishing) to longlining in India under the Blue Revolution programme.

Under the scheme, fishermen can claim up to Rs 15 lakh to convert conventional fishing techniques to longlining fishing and avail of training from National Fisheries Development Board.

A senior executive of NFDB, said: “Longlining is a commercial fishing technique using a long line with baited hooks attached at intervals. It helps in catching the intended breeds of fishes unlike other techniques where big nets and modern-day equipment trap other species as well.”

Trawl fishing is another inadvisable technique, which involves dragging nets across the sea floor to scoop up fish. This results in disturbing the seabed, while harming marine species, said officials.

“After consulting fishermen, and with the research over the years, we have found that a number of modern fishing gears, strong and unnoticeable, are not only efficient at catching the desired fish species but also anything else coming in its path,” said a principal scientist from Central Marine Fisheries Research Institute (CMFRI).

Experts have cautioned that a collapse in fishing sector is imminent, but avoiding trawling and impulsive techniques alike can help the case.

“There are proven solutions to deal with the issue. Fishing gear can be modified so that either fewer non-target species are caught, or if caught they can escape,” he said.

437,['27/02/2020'],Panel enforcing agenda of liquor lobby: Activist,"This story is from February 27, 2020

Chandrapur: Anti-liquor activist Paromita Goswami has alleged that the committee formed to evaluate prohibition in Chandrapur district is enforcing the agenda of liquor lobby . She stated this following reports that memorandums submitted to the committee seeking lifting of liquor ban are 20 times more than those favouring prohibition.

A sub-inspector rank officer of the excise department had reportedly disclosed the figures to a select media within an hour of deadline for submitting memorandums to the committee ended on Tuesday evening. According to the officer, 2.61 lakh memorandums favoured revocation of the ban while only 20,585 demanded its continuation.

The officer termed it as a referendum in favour of removing liquor ban and stated that more than 1.25 lakh memorandums were received on the last day.

“The officer who revealed the figures is not part of the committee and he was not authorized to speak to the media. I have directed the superintendent of the excise department to serve him a show cause notice,” said district collector and head of the committee, Dr Kunal Khemnar.

Questioning intentions of the committee, Goswami said how can confidential figures be disclosed within an hour after the deadline ends. “Firstly, guardian minister Vijay Wadettiwar is repeatedly stating that liquor ban has failed. Secondly, figures favouring lifting of prohibition have been leaked. This shows that public opinion is being built to suit agenda of the liquor lobby,” she said and demanded immediate action against the officer who disclosed the figures.

She announced to boycott the committee and demanded that CM should institute an all inclusive community comprising social workers, women leaders, experts in subject under retired high court judge if government really wants to evaluate the outcome of prohibition in Chandrapur.

“A memorandum to this effect has been sent to chief minister Uddhav Thackeray,” she said and claimed that anti-liquor activists are soon going to meet him to press the demand.

The nine-member committee had sought opinion on the ban in writing or by e-mail between February 10 and 25. It has come to fore that those favouring removal of prohibition undertook a signature campaign on a printed format of memorandum at public places.

WhatsApp message were circulated with an ‘e-mail address’ asking people for opinion against prohibition. TOI has copy of both the printed format as well as the WhatsApp message. Those favouring removal of ban brought such printed and signed memorandums in bundles for submission.

District collector Khemnar confirmed receiving complaints regarding some people moving around seeking signatures on printed memorandums. He claimed that the number of memorandum does not matter to the committee. “It is in no way a referendum. Committee will compile all opinions, gather figures related to liquor crime, domestic violence, accidents etc and submit a report to the guardian minister,” he told TOI.

“If government wants to a referendum, then it would do it as per provision in related law,” said Khemnar.

HYDERABAD: Milk consumers are hit yet again. In the last 10 days, milk prices of private dairies have gone up by Rs 2 to Rs 6 per litre. The rate of toned milk is sold at Rs 50 now and that of whole milk Rs 68 per litre.The state-run Vijaya Dairy toned milk costs Rs 48 per litre, while private dairies like Tirumala, Arokya, Dodla, Tirumala and Heritage are selling at Rs 48 to Rs 50. The price of Amul milk, which is sold at Rs 46 a litre, is also likely to go up in the next few days, said sources.Officials attribute the spiralling effect in prices to milk production seeing a dip in Telangana . With production taking a hit, the rates have been witnessing an upward trend. Officials said this phenomenon of milk shortage happens once five years.One main reason for the shortfall in the production, officials say, could be due to dairy farmers switching over to agriculture. “With ground water levels going up and irrigated water supply increasing, many dairy farmers got into farming as they thought it is more lucrative,” an official said.While this has led to reduction in milk production, officials point out that it has also caused less procurement of milk. “We are forced to increase the rates as farmers are expecting higher returns,” a representative of a private dairy said. Traders said the farmers were supplying milk to only those who are offering them a better price.The government-owned Vijaya Dairy has also increased milk procurement rate from Rs 2 toRs 4 in this month alone.There are about two lakh farmers who sell milk to dairies run by cooperative societies in Karimnagar and Mulkanoor.

The bridge where the incident took place had no railing to prevent the bus from falling off it

JAIPUR: Bundi district administration will write to the state government regarding the dismal condition of the bridges on rivers in the state. In the Bundi accident, where the bus lost control and fell into the river , the bridge had no horizontal component to prevent the vehicle from falling off it. The bridge only had small cement pillars, which barely served any purpose.

Antar Singh Nehra, district collector, Bundi said, “The bridge from which the bus fell into the river had vertical component but no horizontal ones which could prevent the vehicle from falling into the water body. The bus broke past the pillar which was completely shattered. The bridge was constructed nearly 40 years ago and since then, has been in the same condition.”

According to officials, there are many such bridges not just in Bundi but across the state which could also lead to similar incidents. “We have found that there are other bridges in the district which also have similar pillars and are dangerous. We will also look at the original plans of the bridges as to how they were planned with the pillars but no complete boundary,” added the collector.

According to the officials, the bridge was constructed by RIDCO many decades back and the collector added, “At present, no action can be taken against anyone as RIDCO had made this bridge years ago. Nowadays, they do not do this kind of construction, but we will try to get the original plans from them.”

Seeing the severity of the accident, which could have been prevented if there was a higher boundary wall, the official said, “We will be writing to the state government requesting them to ask the concerned department to review such bridges and possibly take some measures so that they can be upgraded so that such accidents can be prevented in future.”

KOLHAPUR: During a meeting with district collector Bhausaheb Galande on Wednesday, a delegation of the Aam Aadmi Party’s district unit demanded the completion of Warna dam’s canal work as well as water supply from the same for irrigation purposes.

They said that the Warna’s left irrigation canal has not been completed although the land has been handed over to the government 40 years ago. They said that the farmers who transferred part of their farmlands to the government for developing the canal have to depend on the irrigation schemes of co-operative societies which charge huge sum of money.

Sharad Patil, head of Shahuwadi tehsil unit of the party, said, “Over 150 acres of land was taken by the state government for rehabilitating the people affected by Warna dam and the construction of the canal. Then government had assured the farmers that they will get water from the canal. However, the canal has not yet been constructed and the farmers still await water supply from it. We have to depend on the lift irrigation schemes of co-operative societies for which Rs 60,000 per hectare is being charged. If the canal work would have completed, we could have got water for irrigation purposes at just Rs 4,000 per hectare.”

The members of the delegation, mostly farmers, demanded that the government should give their land back as the canal has not been constructed. They also demanded that the government should compensate for the charges that the farmers had paid to co-operative societies. The farmers claimed that Warna irrigation project was supposed to provide water in Shirala taluka of Sangli district as well as Hatkanangle, Shirol and Panhala talukas of Kolhapur district. The project was commissioned in 1985.

Thrissur: The forest fires severely affect the small species in the forest areas, said former KFRI director in charge Dr P S Essa.

Addressing a workshop about climate change and forest fire at Thrissur press club on Tuesday he said the present fire prevention methods by the forest department are not capable of preventing the forest fires.

“A study found that, when a forest fire occurs in an area the temperature of that area will rise to 300 to 800 degree Celsius and it will affect the vegetation of the entire area,” he said.

“Controlled burning is also not capable of preventing the fires. In most cases, officials can’t control it and it ends up gutting more forest lands. To prevent the forest fires, a more capable system should be developed,” he said.

Climatologist Gopakumar Cholayil said that climate change is clearly visible in our state.

“During the last Christmas season there was no dip in temperature. Then we expected that cool climate would arrive in February this year,” said Cholayil.

But the mercury continues to soar and highest temperatures were recorded in many districts in February. If the same situation continues the heat waves will be recorded in the state on March, he added.

“If the temperature rose over 40 degree Celsius it will be considered as a heat wave. We are now witnessing extreme events like floods and high temperature and it is the clear indication of climate change,” he said.

KFRI principal scientist Dr T V Sajeev said that if the forest fire occurs in a region it will affect the existence of the forest and nearby people.

“The canopy fire in the forest areas are more dangerous and it will affect the vegetation of the evergreen forest areas,” said Sajeev.

Thrissur Press club president K Prabhath, Secretary M V Vineetha also attended the workshop.

Nagpur: After the state government’s decision to shift to a five-day week for its various departments, two big associations representing government schoolteachers in Maharashtra say they don’t want their members to be left out.

The Maharashtra Rajya Prathmik Shikshak Sangh (MRPSS) and Maharashtra Rajya Shikshak Parishad (MRSP) say teachers must also get benefit of the new policy as they too are, government employees.

Rajaram Warute, president of MRPSS said, “We are demanding this specifically for teachers of zilla parishad schools. There are about 2.75 lakh ZP schoolteachers who will benefit from this decision.”

Warute said he is camping in Mumbai, due to the ongoing legislature session, and has given a memorandum to senior leaders from both MVA and the opposition. “This demand is in fact coming from parents as they now have a five day week and say the same should be applicable for their children,” said Warute.

Puja Choudhari, a senior leader of MRSP said there is nothing wrong is extending the benefit to teachers. “We had been supporting this demand since 2011. Our association is of the view that if there is no detrimental effect on the quality of teaching then there is no reason why schools can’t have a five day week,” said Choudhari.

Under Right to Education Act (RTE), schools are required to remain open for over 200 days and the five day week proposal is likely to clash with that. However Warute says they have found a solution to the legal problem. “The minimum requirement for schools being open is also calculated in hours. So for primary section schools need to be open for minimum 600 hours which can be fulfilled by increasing the daily school timings.”

MRPSS proposes to add anywhere between an hour to 90 minutes to the daily schedule to cover up for the time lost. “We believe that shifting to a 10.30am to 5.30pm or beyond schedule will be an effective solution. At least students get two days off which will help them to get refreshed,” said Warute.

446,['27/02/2020'],Surrogacy bill to benefit widows &amp; divorcees too,"This story is from February 27, 2020

Women and child development (WCD) minister Smriti Irani along with Cabinet minister Prakash Javadekar (ANI pho... Read More

NEW DELHI: Accepting key recommendations from a parliamentary select committee, the Cabinet on Wednesday approved the Surrogacy (Regulation) Bill, 2020 allowing a “willing woman” and not just a “close relative” to become a surrogate mother and proposing that widows and divorced women can also benefit from its provisions, besides infertile Indian couples.

The proposed insurance cover for a surrogate mother has also now been increased to 36 months from 16 months earlier.

The bill aims to regulate surrogacy while prohibiting commercial surrogacy and allowing altruistic ones, Cabinet minister Prakash Javadekar said after the meeting.

Women and child development (WCD) minister Smriti Irani added that only Indian couples, with both partners being of Indian origins, can opt for surrogacy in the country.

The 15 major changes suggested by the 23-member Rajya Sabha select committee, headed by Bhupendra Yadav, included omission of five-year wait period before opting for surrogacy, and allowing single women – either divorcee or widow – in the 35- to 45-year age group and Persons of Indian Origin (PIOs) to avail surrogacy.

The previous bill was passed by the Lok Sabha on August 5, 2019, but was referred to the select committee by the Upper House after members raised concerns over clauses such as allowing only altruistic surrogacy with a near relative as a surrogate and not allowing single woman or with the definition of infertility in the proposed legislation.

The Rajya Sabha select committee that examined the bill argued that restricting the surrogate mother to a “close relative” potentially affects the availability of surrogate mothers. “A willing woman shall act as a surrogate mother and be permitted to undergo surrogacy procedures as per the provisions of this Act,” the committee said in its report.

Advocating for the need to allow single woman, it said : “There are conditions under which a single person genuinely needs to avail surrogacy as an option to have a child. One such situation is a young aged widow, who is otherwise capable but cannot carry a child because of fear of social stigma attached to pregnancy of widows in our society.”

After the Cabinet meeting on Wednesday, Irani said PM Narendra Modi has led from the front with a liberal view on the issues of reproductive rights of women, be it medical termination of pregnancy, the Assisted Reproductive Technology Regulation Bill or the surrogacy bill . The Cabinet last week also approved the long pending ART Regulation Bill.

The Surrogacy Regulation Bill, , 2020 – which proposes to regulate surrogacy by setting up a National Surrogacy Board and State Surrogacy Boards along with appropriate authorities in the states and Union Territories – is likely to be tabled in the second half of the budget session beginning next month.

CHENNAI: Several people are walking into eye clinics with red, itchy eyes and opthalmologists say the season for conjunctivitis has just begun.While adults complain of watery eyes, children are showing symptoms of fever, cold and sore throat, along with conjunctivitis.“The viral disease, unlike what we saw last year, isn’t serious. Most people don’t require medication. It settles down in five days. But this time we are seeing many children with flu-like symptoms,” said opthalmologist Dr V Vasumathi of Radhatri Nethralaya. “They may need no medication for the eye, unless there is an associated bacterial infection causing eye inflammation or vision disruption,” she said.Childcare specialists call the condition pharyngoconjunctival fever. “We see this often in school children. It is caused by a virus, usually the adenovirus, and is contagious,” said Dr S Balasubramanian, medical director of Kanchi Kamakoti Childs Trust. This type of fever peaks in summer, particularly when children are in camps and swimming pools, he said. Some children may also complain of fatigue and and upset stomach.Most patients are treated as outpatient and advised to stay athome. They are askedto come back if they notice photophobia (unable to see light), swelling of the eye, vision disruption or a cloudy cornea. “The viral disease is contagious and can spread quickly in classrooms or closed office spaces,” said Dr S Soundari, head of medical services, Agarwal Eye Hospital. “We are commonly seeing at least seven to eight people a day, compared to the usual one or two, or none,” she said.However, unlike last year when most patients had bleeding and severe swelling of the eye, symptoms were milder. “The best thing to do is prevention.

449,['27/02/2020'],Gunman kills 5 at Milwaukee brewery before taking own life,"Police and emergency officials work at an active shooting scene at the Molson Coors headquarters in Milwaukee ... Read More

MILWAUKEE: An employee opened fire Wednesday at one of the nation's largest breweries in Milwaukee, killing five fellow workers before taking his own life, police said.The assailant who attacked the Molson Coors complex was identified as a 51-year-old Milwaukee man who died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound, police said.``There were five individuals who went to work today, just like everybody goes to work, and they thought they were going to go to work, finish their day and return to their families. They didn't _ and tragically they never will,'' Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett said.Authorities offered no immediate motive for the attack and did not release details about the shooter or how the shooting unfolded.None of the victims was identified. Police, who were still contacting relatives, said identities would not be released for at least 24 hours. No one was wounded beyond those who were killed, authorities said.Officers worked for hours to clear the more than 20 buildings in the complex where more than 1,000 people work. They announced at a late evening news conference that the work was done and all employees had been allowed to go home. Police Chief Alfonso Morales said authorities believe the shooter operated alone.President Donald Trump addressed the shooting before speaking at the White House about his administration's efforts to combat the coronavirus.``Our hearts break for them and their loved ones,'' the president said. ``We send our condolences. We'll be with them, and it's a terrible thing, a terrible thing.''The attack occurred at a sprawling complex that includes a mix of corporate offices and brewing facilities. The complex is widely known in the Milwaukee area as ``Miller Valley,`` a reference to the Miller Brewing Co . that is now part of Molson Coors.Molson Coors CEO Gavin Hattersley called the shooter ``an active brewery employee.''``Unfortunately, I am devastated to share that we lost five other members of our family in this tragic incident,'' he said in an email sent to employees. ``There are no words to express the deep sadness many of us are feeling right now.''He said the office would be closed the rest of the week and the brewery shuttered ``for the time being'' to give people time to cope.A group of brewery employees gathered at a nearby bar to talk about what had happened.``We are all a family. We work a lot of hours together, so we're all very sad,'' said Selena Curka, a brewery employee who was about to start her shift when the complex went on lockdown and she was turned away.``It's just weird, because nine times out of 10 you're going to know the shooter,`` said another employee Thomas Milner. ``It's a tight-knit family. Within the brewery we all interact with each other.''Milner was also on his way to work when the shooting happened, and he was turned away too.James Boyles told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel that his wife, Lasonya Ragdales, works at Molson Coors in the claims department. She was texting from inside the facility and told her husband that there was an active shooter and she was locked in a room with a bunch of co-workers, the Journal Sentinel newspaper reported.``Miller Valley'' features a 160-year-old brewery, with a packaging center that fills thousands of cans and bottles every minute and a distribution center the size of five football fields. A massive red Miller sign towers over the complex and is a well-known symbol in Milwaukee, where beer and brewing are intertwined in the city's history.The facility is also home to corporate customer service, finance, human resources and engineering departments. Tours take people to underground caves where beer was once stored, a saloon with intricate woodwork, a stein hall with stained-glass windows, a champagne room meeting hall with leaded-glass windows, and an outdoor beer garden that can hold 300 people.Molson Coors announced in October that it planned to close a Denver office as part of a restructuring to eliminate 400 to 500 jobs. The reorganization was to benefit Milwaukee, which was expected to see hundreds of corporate and support jobs relocated there.Before Wednesday's shooting, there had been three mass killings nationwide in 2020, with 12 total victims. All have been shootings. In 2019, there were 44 mass killings, with 224 total victims. The Associated Press/USA TODAY/Northeastern University Mass Killings database tracks all U.S. homicides since 2006 involving four or more people killed, not including the offender, over 24 hours regardless of weapon, location, victim-offender relationship or motive.The last mass shooting in the Milwaukee area was in August 2012, when white supremacist Wade Michael Page fatally shot six people and wounded four others at a Sikh temple in suburban Oak Creek. Page killed himself after being wounded in a shootout with police. The worst mass shooting in the area in the past 20 years was in 2005, when seven people were killed and four wounded at a church service in Brookfield, a Milwaukee suburb. The shooter killed himself.Shortly before word of the brewery shooting broke, Republican Senate Majority Leader Scott Fitzgerald told reporters in suburban Franklin that state gun laws would not be changing despite a push by Gov. Tony Evers, a Democrat, to do so, according to a report in the Journal Sentinel.Evers called lawmakers into special session late last year to consider expanding background checks and allowing guns to be taken from people deemed a threat. But the Republican-controlled Legislature adjourned without action. Fitzgerald later called the shootings ``an act of evil,'' the Journal Sentinel reported.At a news conference outside Molson Coors, Lt. Gov. Mandela Barnes said, ``We shouldn't accept this.'' He took up the issue later on social media, tweeting: ``Another avoidable uniquely American tragedy. It's not normal, we should never accept it, and we should never relent when 'leaders' offer hollow thoughts and prayers but choose inaction.``In Video: Gunman kills 5, self at Milwaukee brewery",world,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74327021,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-402997,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/gunman-kills-5-at-milwaukee-brewery-before-taking-own-life/articleshow/74326982.cms

TRICHY: A treasure trove of 505 gold coins weighing 1,716 grams surfaced when workers were digging the ground at the Akilandeswari Jambukeswarar temple at Thiruvanaikaval in Trichy on Wednesday. Temple officials said the coins, which had letters resembling Arabic etched on them, could date back to 1000-1200CE.

The temple workers engaged in renovation work stumbled upon a copper vessel with the coins near the Amman Sannathi. On being informed, officials of the Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowment (HR&CE) recovered the vessel and counted the coins in the presence of a policeman.

The officials said the temple administration was clearing the bushes and digging the ground for around 7 feet when they found the vessel.

Though the coins' period or antique value could not be determined yet, the HR&CE officials roughly estimated their value at 68 lakh.

""I have informed the state archaeology department to assess the coins and ascertain the period the coins belong to. Till then, they will be kept in the district treasury,"" collector Sivarasu told ToI.

Though the coins were found around 1 pm, the temple officials had kept it under wraps until 7pm. As soon as he was informed, the collector ordered the temple officials to immediately hand over the treasure to the tahsildar of the Srirangam taluk office.

Despite repeated attempts, executive officer of the temple Mariappan could not be contacted.

They barged into the mosque where at least 20 people were offering prayers. ""I was at the mosque when suddenly a huge group of people entered and started shouting slogans. We ran to save our lives,"" recalled Khursheer Alam, standing outside the remains of his house, which was among six ransacked and set ablaze by the rioters.Delhi violence: Live updatesThe mob also vandalised the mosque and set it ablaze. Mohammad Tayyab, a local, said the mob reached the terrace of the building around 1.30pm, and hoisted the tricolour and a saffron flag. These were removed by locals on Wednesday morning.Locals in the area kept asking the rioters not to damage any property, but they didn't listen. All of them were outsiders. ""Most of the men in the group had covered their faces and were armed with iron rods. Soon, they started burning down the shops in the area. We were afraid that we would be killed,"" said Rajesh Khatri, a resident of Ashok Nagar.After targeting the shops, the men headed towards the six houses.

We have been living here for the past 25 years and never in these years have we had a single discord with any of our Hindu neighbours. We all co-exist here like a family,"" said Rashid.Said Pintu, their neighbour: ""We will stand by them no matter what. We are also Hindus but can never even think of harming people or their property. Some of the shops that have been set on fire were owned by these families only. Now their homes and livelihoods both are destroyed.

Representative image

KOCHI: Reiterating that student organizations do not have the right to compel students to participate in strikes nor do they have the right to conduct strikes on school or college campuses, the high court on Wednesday ordered heads of all educational institutions to promptly report such disturbances to police and asked the state police chief to direct police officers to take prompt action.

Justice P B Suresh Kumar issued the order after considering a total of 26 petitions filed by schools and colleges, with the lead case being a plea by Raju Kuruvilla, manager of MS Higher Secondary School at Ranni in Pathanamthitta, through advocate Jacob P Alex.

In the judgment, the court referred to a 2017 decision (Antony Thomas vs Muhammed Rafique) in which it was held that it is the obligation of police to ensure that academic atmosphere in educational institutions are not disturbed and that educational institutions cannot be hijacked or converted into a political battle field. The court also cited a 2003 decision (Vijayakumar V vs State of Kerala ), which held that police can enter campuses to prevent or take action against students engaging in criminal activities.

The court order said: “…organizations of students do not have the right to disrupt or disturb the academic and other activities of students who do not want to partake in their strikes and agitations, or any right to compel such students to forego the aforesaid activities in their campuses. Similarly, it is also declared that organizations of students do not have any right to convene any meetings and resort to the modes of agitations like strike, dharna, gherao, processions, etc in the school or college campuses… It is also declared that it is the obligation of the police to ensure that the fundamental rights of the students to pursue their academics in the campuses are not thwarted by anyone...”

However, the judgment does not mean that students cannot voice their opinions on political issues and redress their grievances by recourse to various forums allowed by statutes and executive orders.

The court said educational institutions are forced to approach the HC for police protection despite several judicial pronouncements regarding the rights of students. The position of government and quasi-government institutions is that students have to forego studies until disturbances and disruptions settle down naturally, the court said. It is the students who become victims of student unrest in campuses, the court said.

Noticing that judicial pronouncements alone won’t suffice, the court ordered, “…I deem it appropriate to direct the director of collegiate education, director of higher secondary education, director of public instruction and also the registrars of the universities in the state to bring this judgment to the notice of the heads of the educational institutions under them, and direct them to bring external and internal disturbances affecting the conduct of the classes forthwith to the notice of the police... There will also be a direction to the DGP to bring this judgment to the notice of the police officers...”

Hubballi: Hopes are riding high on chief minister BS Yediyurappa ’s budget , slated to be presented in the next week. The people of Dharwad, and North Karnataka , who were instrumental in steering the BJP to power both during the assembly elections in 2018 and in the bypolls held late last year, are hoping for a veritable bonanza from the BJP government.

Former chief minister HD Kumaraswamy, who led the JD(S)-Congress coalition government for 14 months, had drawn flak for neglecting North Karnataka in his maiden budget speech in 2018. Now, with Yediyurappa set to present the budget after the collapse of the Kumaraswamy-led coalition government, expectations of a large corpus of funds being allocated in all sectors, particularly for infrastructure.

Among the longstanding demands of the people of North Karnataka is for the setting up of a special economic zone (SEZ), which they are convinced will give a fillip to industrial development in the region and help solve the problem of unemployment. The failure of successive governments to earmark funds towards this initiative has been a source of discontent among the people. Now, people are hoping for allocation of funds for an SEZ in Hubballi-Dharwad, in addition to announcement of three or four industrial parks in the rest of North Karnataka.

The lack of a visionary document such as the comprehensive development plan (CDP) for Hubballi-Dharwad, among the urban centres chosen for the Smart Cities project, highlights the ironical situation that the twin cities find themselves in. Stakeholders have reportedly appealed to Yediyurappa to make an allocation for a new CDP in this year’s budget. The CM has also been requested to divert funds to ensure an efficient solid waste management (SWM) mechanism is in place in Hubballi-Dharwad. Civic groups and stakeholders in the industrial sector are hoping that the mechanism emulates the one in Dubai and thereby serves as a model for the other cities of the region. There is also a demand for upgrading of all roads connecting Hubballi-Dharwad with other urban centres of the state. Pressure is also being exerted on the state government to ensure sufficient funds for the truck terminal proposed to be built in Hubballi. Those keen on the project pointed to Hubballi’s strategic location on the road network – it is a nodal point on five national highways – as the rationale for setting up such a terminal in the city.

President of the Karnataka Chamber of Commerce and Industry , Hubballi Mahendra Ladhad told TOI that allocation of funds for infrastructure, speedy internet connectivity and uninterrupted power supply would inspire confidence in the IT/BT sector to invest in the twin cities. “There is also a need to upgrade the bypass road to a four-lane road, and funds need to be earmarked towards this,” he added.

Ladhad also expressed the need for the state government to set the wheels in motion for the setting up of skill development centres for aerospace industries, and silk production in the region. “This will help many youngsters, including those enrolled in ITI courses to hone their skills. Also, the CM must announce the setting up of a Food Safety and Standards of India centre in Hubballi-Dharwad, which will eliminate the need for local manufacturers to go to Pune and Bengaluru to get their products certified,” said Ladhad, asking the CM to take note of the scope for growth of the food processing industry in North Karnataka.

Calling for reforms in agro-based industries, Ladhad added, “All agriculture produce market committee (APMC) units must be upgraded, and all facilities provided at these plants. Cess levied on agricultural produce must be reduced from 1.5% to 0.5%, and rules passed mandating holding a review meeting of the APMC once every three months.”

Pointing to the central government’s approval for setting up the Central Institute of Plastic Engineering and Technology in Hubballi-Dharwad, Ladhad said that the CM’s budget should ensure sufficient allocation for the centre. Setting up of solar parks in North Karnataka and establishing a maize processing centre in Ranebennur in Haveri district, in addition to pumping funds to boost tourism in the region are among the other demands.

Ladhad also highlighted the need for the state government to clear the decks for the implementation of the Dr Nanjundappa Report. “We are hopeful of the CM honouring our demands,” he added.

455,['27/02/2020'],"Officials’ errors have deprived flood victims of rightful compensation, says Vinay Kulkarni","This story is from February 27, 2020

Dharwad: Growing frustration with mistakes committed by officials in assessing damage to property during the floods that ravaged North Karnataka last year prompted victims of the natural calamity, and Congress workers to take out a rally to protest the inefficiency of the administrative machinery in Dharwad on Thursday. Former minister and senior Congress member Vinay Kulkarni was among those at the head of the protesters.

The rally, which started at Kadapa Maidan proceeded through several thoroughfares of Dharwad before concluding at the deputy commissioner’s office, where the protesters sat in a dharna.

Kulkarni said that the government had classified properties under three categories based on the extent of damage (A, B and C). “However, the surveyors have committed several mistakes and some victims who have suffered extensive damage have been denied their rightful compensation,” he added.

Pointing to the extensive loss of crops and property that North Karnataka had suffered owing to the spate, the former minister said, “Roads in various villages have been washed away nearly entirely. But the officials, instead of conducting a survey using strict scientific guidelines, appear to have succumbed to political pressure. They have disbursed funds meant for the victims to relatives of political leaders.”

Kulkarni alleged that Manjula Kallur, a flood victim, had taken the extreme step of ending her life a few days ago after she failed in getting the compensation rightly due to her. “The government must ensure that her bereaved family is duly compensated,” he added.

Kulkarni also expressed outrage with nationalised banks issuing notices to flood victims seeking repayment of loans. He questioned the rationale behind asking farmers, busy trying to rebuild their life after the floods, could be expected to repay their debts. “The banks must stop issuance of such orders immediately,” he said.

The senior Congress member, who submitted a memorandum addressed to chief minister BS Yediyurappa to the deputy commissioner seeking redressal for the flood victims’ grievances, also called on the central government to turn its attention to generation of employment.

Hubballi: The civic corporation office on Lamington Road, which is a heritage building, and Lamington School are set to get a green makeover soon, replete with solar panels and plantation on campus. The facelift will come at a cost of Rs 5 crore under the Smart City Project.

The park in front of Chittagupi Hospital will also be redeveloped.

“The buildings will have solar panels to generate electricity which will reduce their dependence on power companies. The Hubballi-Dharwad Municipal Corporation office and other buildings on the campus have set up rainwater harvesting systems already,” said SH Naregal, special officer of the Hubballi-Dharwad Smart City Limited (HDSCL). “We also plan to grow native vegetation in these locations. The makeover will be in keeping with Indian Green Building Council regulations.

“The campuses will be lit with solar-powered piezoelectric crystals. Smart dustbins will be placed and a smart waste disposal system will be adopted in these buildings,” Naregal said. “The HDMC main building, which is a major landmark in the city, and the park near it, will become must-visit spots.”

An HDSCL officer on condition of anonymity said the project has been in the pipeline for long. Tenders were invited thrice but vendors failed to meet the criteria in the technical bid, he said.

457,['27/02/2020'],KPSC applicants in a fix as Aadhaar not allowed for ID proof,"This story is from February 27, 2020

Hubballi: Applicants to the post of gazetted probationers are facing a hurdle in the very first step – the Karnataka Public Service Commission has not included Aadhaar as an eligible identity proof. Graduates from rural and rurban areas, who make up a majority of the applicants, say Aadhaar is the most commonly available document and this is not being accepted for submission of forms.

KPSC has listed voter ID, driving licence, passport and PAN card as admissible ID proofs. The last date for submission of applications is March 6.

Earlier this month, KPSC issued the notification for 106 gazetted probationers’ posts for 2017-18. These include the posts of deputy SP of police; assistant commissioner for labour and commercial taxes, tahsildar, and assistant director in several departments. Graduation is the minimum required qualification.

While applicants said they had called the helpline number and complained and would submit a memorandum, KPSC authorities said they had heard no opposition. “We have not received any complaint in this regard. We feel candidates will have a voter ID or driving licence for sure by the time they complete their degree. We cannot make Aadhaar card mandatory for recruitment because that might create a legal issue. We will check with the Union government and decide,” said KPSC secretary G Sathyavathi.

“Most graduates never get around to applying for a passport. They get a PAN card when they need to share it with the employer. By asking for these documents, KPSC is indirectly excluding rural youths and candidates from the middle and lower middle classes,” said Renuka Kanakammanavar, another applicant. “Arts and commerce graduates generally don’t apply for a passport or PAN card immediately after their degree,” said Rajeshwari.

Ambarish Bannikoppa from Gadag district said he got his bachelors degree from KKS College in Hubballi. “Students like me who have studied outside home have not got a passport, PAN card, voter ID or driving licence made. But we have had to provide Aadhaar number for admission and scholarship even at the school level. We will not be able to apply if KPSC does not allow Aadhaar,” he said.

“I cannot get a passport or PAN card done before March 6. I’m losing all hope of submitting my application,” said Santosh Naikwadi of Vijayapura.

Savita, Geetakka, Poornima, Venkatesh and Sanjeev said they had been to a cybercafe to submit their application but Aadhaar was not being accepted. “The KPSC helpline numbers are either switched off or they failed to address our grievance,” Poornima said.

File image used for representation

NEW DELHI: The Centre on Wednesday launched a newly designed Market Intelligence and Early Warning System (MIEWS) which is a ‘first-of-its-kind’ platform for ‘real time monitoring’ of prices of tomatoes, onions and potatoes (TOP) and generating alerts for intervention simultaneously.

The system will forecast wholesale prices of these three key vegetables for three months and alert the government to take timely intervention in case of price crash due to a production glut.

The portal, launched by Union minister for food processing industries Harsimrat Kaur Badal , will disseminate all relevant information related to TOP crops such as prices and arrivals, area, yield and production, imports and exports, crop calendars and crop agronomy in an easy to use visual format.

The MIEWS is launched under the ‘Operation Greens’ scheme which was announced in the Budget 2018-19, with an outlay of Rs 500 crore, to stabilise supply of TOP crops and to ensure their availability throughout the country round the year without price volatility. The ‘Operation Greens’ is also meant to promote Farmer Producers Organisations (FPOs), agri-logistics , processing facilities and professional management.

The alerts under the system will be triggered when prices of these three perishable commodities fall to a three-year low level at the time of harvest or when the price fall is more than 50% from the year ago or when the fall in rates is lower than the benchmark fixed by Centre/state government for a specified period.

The portal will show wholesale prices of these three commodities from 128 markets, monitored by private firm Agriwatch, and data of 1,200 ‘mandis’ tracked by Agmark. It will show prices of both producing and consuming centres.

Under the ‘Operation Greens’ scheme, Badal said the government has approved a grant of Rs 161 crore for creation of five clusters in these three crops at producing centres. The total cost of these five clusters is Rs 425 crore and will benefit 15,000 farmers, she added.

Three onion clusters will come up in Maharashtra and Gujarat, one each cluster of potato and tomato will be developed in Gujarat and Andhra Pradesh, respectively. A storage capacity of 90,000 tonnes and processing capacity of 3.36 lakh tonne will come up in these five clusters.

462,['27/02/2020'],CBSE schools wary of mandatory Marathi rule,"This story is from February 27, 2020

Nagpur: The bill to make Marathi a compulsory subject in all schools is all set to become a law on Thursday as it will be tabled in the state legislature’s lower house where the government has sufficient numbers to pass it.

On Wednesday, the bill cleared the upper house without any hitch, making it clear that no party would be opposing it. Once the bill is passed, Marathi will be compulsory from Std I to X in all schools operating in the state.

In Nagpur, CBSE, ICSE and international board schools are, however, unhappy with the ‘mandatory’ tag citing ground realities.

Not wanting to speak openly considering the political sensitivity, a school’s trustee said, “What happens if a student comes from Kerala in Std IX or X due to the transfer of a parent? Do we expect the child to cope with Marathi at that level even though the language is alien to it?.”

Another CBSE school principal said “I have Marathi till Std VIII in my school and now I have to plan properly on how to proceed with the higher classes. I am sure CBSE will inform us about the curriculum well in advance.”

State education minister Varsha Gaikwad told the state legislature that the new policy will be implemented in a phased manner. Her short statement suggested that in the first phase, it will be only the primary section in which Marathi as a mandatory subject will be implemented. And going by the same statement, it seemed that the implementation of the policy in totality, till Std X, might take a couple of years.

A senior CBSE school principal said this seemed more of a game of one upmanship. “It’s almost like the state government wants to show who’s the boss. I’m sure they also know that it’s going to be chaotic for those getting transferred,” said the principal.

Another trustee of a school said this could even lead to people avoiding admissions in the state. “If an army officer is moving from Jaipur to Nagpur when his son is in Std IX, he would prefer to keep his family back there for a couple of years,” she said.

For all schools, the ball is now in CBSE’s court. “If it’s mandatory in Std X then CBSE comes into play immediately. They have to intimate us with all the details as it will affect the grade sheet with an additional mandatory subject,” said a principal.

Presently, only graduates of modern medicines (MBBS) and ayurveda (BAMS) can be recruited for the government jobs.

More than 900 homeopathy practitioners from Vidarbha had a meeting at Antarbharti Homeopathic Medical College (AHMC) in Dabha recently.

Practising homeopaths also demanded that AIIMS Nagpur should have a separate homeopathy section.

“Nagpur is emerging as a medical hub of Central India, but we don’t have a government homeopathic college in city. AIIMS is now functioning and it has a separate AYUSH unit. We want homeopathy to get prominence in this unit,” said Dr Manish Patil of Orange City Homeopaths Association (OCHA).

“India has over 250 homeopathic medical institutes and around 2,50,000 homeopathic doctors. AHMC is one of the pioneering institutes in homeopathy.

Representative image

MUMBAI: Wrinkled faces with grey hair will soon man dedicated help desks for the elderly at police stations in Mumbai. In a first, the police department will handpick senior citizens and train them to help individuals their age tackle common grievances.

The volunteers may mediate in squabbles or offer counseling, but they will have to direct the aggrieved to police officers if it is a serious issue involving law. The volunteers can meet senior citizens at public places to hear them out. Activists working for the welfare of the elderly have welcomed the move.

As a pilot project, help desks will come up at Malabar Hill and Vile Parle police stations next month. The volunteers will be selected after taking physical and mental fitness into account. They will be trained on what questions to ask and how best to resolve issues. They will work in shifts at the police stations.

Over the years, Mumbai Police have been following a system where beat constables keep a record of senior citizens living in their jurisdiction and visit their homes once a month to check on them. Police have also been running a helpline (1090) for senior citizens in distress. This system will be supplemented with a force of trained elderly volunteers who can be approached by any senior citizen having a grievance.

""This is a good move and will provide meaningful engagement to elders, particularly those in their 60s, many of whom are active. Senior citizens are an unused asset and trained elderly volunteers can bridge the gap between police and public,"" said Sailesh Mishra of the NGO, Silver Innings. He added that there are more than 100 associations for senior citizens registered in the city. ""Members of these associations usually come together for yoga or spiritual discussions. They would be enthused to do social work,"" Mishra added.

Police are also contemplating creation of WhatsApp groups for volunteers from every locality, with one policeman added to the group in case assistance is required.

KOZHIKODE: P Sankaran , former minister and Congress leader who died on Tuesday night, will be laid to rest on the premises of his ancestral house at Perambra on Thursday.

Sankaran was admitted to the M V R Cancer Centre here a few months ago.

The body was taken to his house at Kadiyangad on Wednesday evening. Earlier, the body was placed at the house at Karikkamkulam , DCC office, Kozhikode Town Hall, Koyilandi Town Hall and the Congress office at Perambra for the public to offer tributes.

People from various walks of life offered tributes to the Congress leader who was active in Kozhikode's political circles for decades.

A member of the A K Antony cabinet in 2001, Sankaran was the minister of health and tourism. He became member of Parliament in 1998 by defeating M P Veerendrakumar.

He was also the general secretary of KPCC, president of the DCC, chairman of the district UDF, district president of the Youth Congress and member of the Calicut University Syndicate. Entering politics during the student days, Sankaran was a staunch follower of Congress stalwart K Karunakaran. It was the 'Leader' who persuaded him from joining police as sub-inspector and to continue in politics. Karunakaran was instrumental in getting him elected from the Koyilandi assembly constituency.

Poonamallee, the western gateway to Chennai, could soon emerge as the city’s second IT highway. The arterial road is attracting several realtors interested in developing IT parks.Interestingly, a new trend of housing projects being transformed into office spaces for IT firms is shaping up, with metro rail connectivity being the key driver to spark interest in real estate along the Mount-Poonamallee Road .At least two residential projects on land parcels at Porur and Poonamallee, which had applied for planning permission with the Chennai Metropolitan Development Authority (CMDA) for housing projects, were withdrawn to build multi-storeyed buildings to accommodate IT companies.R Murugesan, MD of ARAM Realty, said plans are afoot to convert a 15-acre plot at Poonamallee into an IT special economic zone. “We are developing an IT SEZ spread over 1.3 million square feet on the land parcel, which was earmarked for a residential- cum-mall complex three years ago,” he said.In fact, the developer had applied for planning approval to construct apartments, but changed his plans in the wake of the state government announcing a metro rail corridor linking Poonamallee with the rest of the city. “This has transformed the dynamics of utilising it for office space to house IT companies,” he said.A study conducted to explore the commercial potential of Mount-Poonamallee Road said that the metro rail line has made Poonamallee accessible for city residents as the travel time will be reduced. “Even rentals would be 50% lesser than IT parks on OMR and the core city that could attract mid-level multinational companies, BPOs, IT and ITES firms,” Murugesan, former CEO of Shriram IT SEZ said.The 15km stretch between St Thomas Mount and Poonamallee is witnessing an expansion of office space, with three IT parks offering 3.5 million square foot office space under construction at Porur.While the Mount-Poonamallee stretch has better groundwater availability as compared to OMR that depends on tankers for water supply, the proposed bus mofussil terminus for west-bound buses at Thirumazhisaiand the second airport at Parandur off Chennai - Bengaluru highway could prove to be the icing on the cake.Aslam Mohamed, joint managing director of Allied Investments and Housing Pvt Limited, who is executing a joint venture IT park project at Porur, said that their facility will be coming up in an area of 7,00,000 sq ft.“We sought planning permission from CMDA to construct an apartment complex in 2017. We switched over to building an IT park after the declaration of metro rail link to Porur,” he said. The development comes against the backdrop of the city recording high absorptions of commercial space in recent years -- more than 60 lakh square feet in 2019. Sanjay Chugh, city head, ANAROCK Property Consultants, said the rental yield at Poonamallee was 3.15% last year.“As long as connectivity via metro rail improves, there are higher chances of more projects coming up beyond Poonamallee,” he said.Another real estate consultant, Savills, said that there has also been a rising interest from co-living operators for this micro market given the sheer size of the workforce in the locality.“We are witnessing upcoming residential developments around these large IT parks, primarily to cater to the workforce, extending beyond Porur junction,” said Anup Vasanth, the firm’s Chennai managing director.With realtors showing preference for setting up IT parks in the suburbs, software companies could soon have a new address – OMR 2.0",chennai,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74327140,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1051427,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/tamil-nadu-mount-poonamallee-road-could-turn-into-omr-2-0-for-it-firms/articleshow/74327122.cms

The father of the arrested student being escorted away by police

CHENNAI: A second-year student of Madras Medical College , who was arrested along with his father on Wednesday in connection with the NEET scam , had used an impersonator who took the entrance exam at a centre in Bihar, investigators have found.

The student was expelled from the college last October, but could not be booked till now because of delay in establishing mismatch of fingerprints on the NEET answer sheet and other documents submitted to the college during admission.

Police said K Deivendran, 53, a businessman who hails from Hosur, had paid 20 lakh to a Bengaluru-based broker to arrange an impersonator for his son. The broker is yet to be apprehended.

Deivendran told police that he met the mediator in Bengaluru through a common friend. A police officer said, ""Once we arrest the mediator we may be able to get to many impersonators who wrote NEET on behalf of students from Tamil Nadu,"" said a police officer.

According to a press release, police arrested Deivendran and his son (name withheld) after scrutinizing documents submitted by the student to the Madras Medical College and the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE). A magistrate court in the city on Wednesday remanded them in judicial custody.

Police said the student enrolled in MMC in 2018 claiming that he had appeared for NEET at a centre in Gaya, Bihar, though he was born and brought up in Hosur. After the scrutiny found the papers suspicious, the college filed a police complaint which was forwarded to the CB-CID.

In October last year, news about a case of impersonation of a second year medical student in the Madras Medical College came up. College dean Dr R Jayanthi filed a police complaint at the Flower Bazaar police station, which was later transferred to CB-CID. There was so far no other complaint against anyone of the 2018 batch, said director of medical education Dr R Narayana Babu. Earlier he had asked all medical college deans to verify the credentials of first year students in MBBS and PG courses.

CB-CID police personnel have so far arrested 16 people including seven medical students, six parents and three middlemen.

476,['27/02/2020'],"Didi pens poem against violence, prays for peace","This story is from February 27, 2020

Bhubaneswar: Chief minister Mamata Banerjee has lamented over “…so many lives lost, not to return again” in a poem she wrote called ‘Hell’ that gave vent to her anguish over the Delhi communal violence. The poem also refers to a “storm raging the country at gunpoint” and a “search for an address getting lost”.

Banerjee, who is in Odisha on a four-day visit, earlier on Wednesday offered prayers at the Jagannath Temple in Puri seeking harmony and peace in the country.

Responding to a media query in Puri on the Delhi violence, the CM iterated her earlier statement. “We don’t want bloodshed, we want peace. I prayed for the same before Lord Jagannath.”

Banerjee is expected to meet her Odisha counterpart Naveen Patnaik at the latter’s home, Naveen Niwas, on Friday before the two attend the Eastern Zonal Council meeting here to be chaired by Union home minister Amit Shah later the same day.

Bihar and Jharkhand CMs Nitish Kumar and Hemant Soren respectively are also scheduled to attend the Shah-led meeting. Banerjee will come face to face with Shah and Naveen for the first time since the enactment of CAA, which the Odisha CM supports.

In the poem that she posted on her Facebook page, Banerjee wrote: “So much bloodshed, so many deaths, anger burning like fire, a Holi of blood, before the Holi of colours! Humanity a worst sufferer.”

“A peaceful country, turned violent, is it the end of democracy,” she asks in the poem and concludes by saying “The sacred land turns into hell”.

Before leaving Kolkata on Tuesday evening, Banerjee had told reporters: “Ours is a country where we need to stay together. I am deeply disturbed. I am deeply concerned. I do not know what is going on there. We, the people of India, want peace. I appeal to all, please restore peace.”

In Odisha, speculations are rife on the discussion points between Banerjee and Naveen since they are on the opposite ends of the CAA divide. “Mamata ji will pay a courtesy call to the Odisha CM. There is no fixed agenda in the one-on-one meeting,” said sources in the CMO in Bhubaneswar.

The sources added that the current political situations in the wake of violence in Delhi over CAA may figure in the brief meeting.

The same day, Shah is scheduled to address a pro-CAA rally at Janata Maidan in Bhubaneswar, the first such rally to be addressed by the home minister after the latest CAA violence in New Delhi.

Midnapore/Kolkata: From the man on the street to audiences in swanky auditoriums, Trinamool Congress chief Mamata Banerjee is comfortable with all. She connects with them at ease. But TMC this time has come up with a stunt that has sprung a surprise on party ranks.

TMC has issued a barcoded invitation card bearing the invitee’s name for the party programme at Netaji Indoor Stadium on March 2. Issued by name to party organisers from block party president to MLAs, MPs and ministers, it looks like a corporate card.

Captioned ‘AITC event launch’, the card bears Banerjee’s photograph and a barcode, and mentions the invitee’s name and organisational post. It also specifies the gate through which s/he should enter and the gallery where s/he should take the seat. An advisory, printed overleaf, says the invitee has to enter through the designated gate 15 minutes ahead of the 10am programme, collect the food coupon against the card and keep the counterfoil while taking a seat.

Banerjee is likely to present the civic campaign’s salient features to party organisers at the programme.

TMC seniors suggest the card was designed to ensure the invitees were in attendance. “There have been instances of the card being transferred to others. This should not happen,” said party spokesperson Partha Chatterjee.

TMC sources said party leaders are doing their best to tackle TMC-Yuva Trinamool squabbles that have hit the streets in several parts of Bengal. Party seniors don’t want any trouble during the March 2 programme. One of them said the barcode has been introduced to track the distribution of cards and quickly spot the zone and person in charge during an exigency.

Kolkata: CPM and other Left parties hit the city’s streets on Wednesday evening, raising slogans against the “divisive politics of religion” in keeping with the tradition of secular politics in West Bengal.

The rally was taken out against the communal conflagration in northeast Delhi that has triggered tension in certain areas of Kolkata and its suburbs. Left Front chairman Biman Bose led the march from Entally market to Park Circus Maidan, an area with a strong presence of the minority community.

Left functionaries sent out a word of caution against the Modi-Shah regime and its attempt to provide citizenship based on religious identity (CAA) followed by National Population Register (NPR) and National Register of Citizens (NRC). They said CAA-NPR-NRC are all part of a sinister design to drive a wedge between communities with the aim to polarise people on the lines of “us and them”.

CPM general secretary Sitaram Yechury has sought an appointment with President Ram Nath Kovind to apprise him of the opposition’s views on the “very disturbing situation prevailing in the country’s capital”. CPI, SP, DMK and NCP functionaries are likely to accompany Yechury to Rashtrapati Bhavan.

Work on developing Ram Gawande Udyan is on, say civic officials

MUMBAI: Soon, Mahim residents will be able to play volleyball , practise yoga and go for walks on a 25,000-sq-ft recreation ground that was earlier being 'misused' as a parking lot by locals for almost a decade.

Recently, the BMC took over Ram Gawande Udyan in Bhandar gully, which is marked as a recreation ground in the revised draft Development Plan-2034, and placed signboards asking locals not to park there. Work has started on developing the recreation ground, which will be ready in a few months, said a civic official.

The amenity plot was to be handed over to the BMC by the developer after completion of a Slum Rehabilitation Project (SRA) project nearly 10 years ago, but it never happened. ""Unfortunately, the location of the amenity plot is such that it provides the sole access path to a building. So, when drawing up the plan to develop the recreation ground, we had to keep in mind the convenience of the residents of this building,"" said the officer.

Kiran Dighavar, ward officer of G-North which covers Mahim area, said: ""We found that many local youths would play volleyball on the open space even when vehicles were parked there. So, we decided to incorporate a space for them in the garden plan. We are also working out a way for emergency services, like ambulance and fire engines, to reach the building that has access only from the ground.""

Local corporator Sheetal Gambhir from the BJP said she had been pushing to reclaim this space for public use since a long time. ""There is no recreation ground in the area, therefore reclaiming this plot to benefit the locals is important. We plan to create a designated space for walkers and joggers, a seating area for senior citizens and yoga lawns,"" she added.

NEW DELHI: Taking a cue from a similar project in Chandni Chowk, north corporation has initiated work on a multilevel-parking-cum-commercial complex at Qutab Road in Sadar Bazar . The concessionaire engaged for the job had begun excavation work at the site, a corporation official said, adding that the project was key to decongesting the Old Delhi area.

""The structure will have seven floors, including two basements and five upper floors. The ground and the first floors will be used by the concessionaire to develop a commercial complex. The remaining floors will have parking space for 174 vehicles,"" the official said.

Jai Prakash, north corporation standing committee chairman, said the project had been conceived on a public-private partnership basis and the civic agency would not have to spend a single penny on it. ""On the one hand, it will help reduce congestion on roads and, on the other, generate revenue for us. We have provided 1,300 sqm of land to the company that is developing the facility. It will pay Rs 30 crore in three instalments to the corporation by October 2020. In addition, we expect to get Rs 75 lakh annually as lease rent,"" he said.

As per the terms and conditions of the project, space for 130 vehicles will be transferred to the corporation after five years. ""We will arrange for running this parking lot on our own after five years. But the shops will be used entirely by the concessionaire,"" Prakash said.

A civic official said after the traders' association recently moved high court over the parking problems in the area, a meeting was called by MoHUA secretary where it was decided that the civic agency take up the project immediately.

The traders, however, have now pursued the civic agency to increase the height of the structure from the proposed 15 metres for the project to be successful. Dev Raj Baweja, general secretary of Confederation of Sadar Bazar Traders' Association, said: ""Parking is a major issue in Sadar Bazaar. The plan is good, but we need more space. When over 1,000 cars are parked on the road daily, how will making space for 174 vehicles help?""

KOLKATA: The level crossing at the Chitpore railway yard is likely to be thrown open on the first day of the next month. In case there is a sudden delay, the administration said it should be ready before the higher secondary exams that are scheduled towards the end of the second week of March.Once operational, the new alignment will provide relief to goods vehicles, who are currently not being allowed in the area for most part of the day. Though a detailed plan is awaited, good vehicles are expected to use the Strand Bank Road-Sarbamangala Ghat-Cossipore alignment.The cops and transport department are also planning an alternative auto route from Cossipore to Bagbazar using this alignment for maximum use of the new link in the day time. The move will also help decongest the highways and its approaches, where trucks are getting stuck after not being able to enter the city due to various prevailing restrictions on their movement.While the lane widening and strengthening, alongside concretization, which was required immediately near the railway tracks is mostly over, parallel work by railways on the tracks is almost reaching an end. The all-important rail gate and the necessary gateman’s room, too, have come up.While the railways concretized around 200m of the road around the railway tracks in order to allow movement of heavy trucks, the KMC has created around 300m of new road besides the widening of the existing road. Two shops and a couple of godowns, too, were pulled down to complete the work, claimed local sources.The proposed level-crossing will connect the Braja Dayal Shah Road located next to the Cossipore Bridge with Sethpukur Road and Pranakrishna Mukherjee Road on the Bagbazar side. Cops are making some last moment changes on the K C Chatterjee Road, which is expected to handle heavy traffic at night.Police said the road will be crucial for traffic flow in the morning as it allows two-way movements. “While trucks can use this to enter the Chitpur terminal, smaller vehicles can use it if the Belgachhia bridge witnesses too much jam,” said an officer.The state government had earlier consulted the railway to ensure there were no operational glitches and that necessary clearances were made available from the railway board before the level crossing was built across the tracks.The cops said they are also trying to see if the Khagen Chatterjee Road can continue handling the extra pressure. “Using this road has eased the traffic. Any new plan will involve a peak-hour traffic study. Every option is being studied in detail,” said a cop.",kolkata,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74327150,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-852125,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/chitpore-level-crossing-may-open-on-march-1-to-ease-tallah-traffic/articleshow/74326550.cms
484,['27/02/2020'],Docu film to focus on city Jews’ ‘identity crisis’,"This story is from February 27, 2020

Kolkata: Identity crisis plaguing Kolkata’s Jewish community is the subject of Ilmaz Syed’s forthcoming documentary. This is one of the smallest communities of the city, with just around 20 members.

Titled ‘Beginning of an End’, the documentary bypasses nostalgic references to the Nahoums bakery and the beauty of stained glass synagogues to focus on the untold story of questioned identities and what it takes to be or not to be a Jew in today’s Kolkata.

Through interviews of prominent members of the community, Syed has explored the dynamics involving identity issues, motives of converts, ambitions of community leaders and conspiracy theories. “In the teaser, the city Jews have spoken about how identity issues based on prehistoric religious practices are being raked up inside the micro-community to get some elderly members of the community disqualified as authentic Jews. Some alleged that non-Jewish people are claiming false Jewish lineage expressing their claim over the Jewish property. While making this documentary, I came across the friction within the community, which is basically related to power and property issues.”

The teaser of the documentary has already created a stir. At the centre of this identity crisis is 74-year-old A M Cohen, the general secretary of the Jewish Community Affairs and secretary of the Board of the Jewish Girls’ School. According to the Jewish religious laws, a person is a Jew if the mother is Jewish. “My husband was Jewish and I converted to Judaism after my marriage in 1970. My conversion was accepted by all members of my community down the years. Recently, questions have been raised because I have become a thorn in the efforts to sell assets,” said Cohen.

Complexities regarding conversion add layers to the movie’s content. “Once you renounce the Jewish faith, you can no longer be considered Jewish. Interestingly, those supporting that these people now be recognised as Jews are doubting my conversion. But, they haven’t even seen my conversion papers,” she added. In her opinion, the current identity crisis is a “tool” being used by some to “remove” her from the position she holds.

The teaser has video recordings of Ian Zachariah, a prominent community member who has “resigned” from all posts because he “didn’t endorse the way things were moving on the question of assets”. “Her conversion is now being brought up since she is coming in the way for many,” Zachariah told TOI.

Also lending his voice in the teaser is Shillong’s David R Ashkenazy. The honorary secretary of the Maghen David Synagogue and the president and trustee of Beth El Synagogue, Ashkenazy told TOI: “Earlier, those who were half-Jewish in origin were all working as a part of the community. The identity issue has weakened us further when the community members starting using arguments like who is Jew and who is not and who is a Kolkata Jew and who isn’t one. By doing this, we have created the opportunity for others to cease something that they can gain from us. I hope the frictions we have faced will be sorted out and apprehensions over Jewish identity issues will soon be laid to rest.”

485,['27/02/2020'],How cops in Ghaziabad stopped mob in its tracks,"This story is from February 27, 2020

Ghaziabad SP (rural) Neeraj Kumar Jadaun

GHAZIABAD: Just 100 metres from police barricades at the border, a slogan-shouting mob of 10 went from house to house in Delhi's Karawal Nagar on Tuesday afternoon, knocking on doors.

Moments before this group had turned into the alley, the police team stationed on the other side of the border - in Ghaziabad 's Lal Bagh - had seen a family secure themselves inside one of the Karawal Nagar houses.

In a sudden burst of violence, the mob set on fire like expert arsonists a bike and a Scooty, a car and an e-rickshaw parked in the alley.

When they got no response from the houses, they decided to hit back by smashing glass bottles filled with fuel into the walls. It didn't take long for the UP Police team to realise Molotov cocktails would be next. They only had a few seconds to save whoever was within those walls.

Ghaziabad's SP (rural) Neeraj Kumar Jadaun , who held charge at the border checkpoint set up to stop any movement between Delhi and UP, made the decision. He crossed the border and dashed towards the mob. Subdivisional magistrate (Loni) Khalid Anjum, circle officer Rajkumar Pandey and around 30 other policemen followed. They were in anti-riot gear. The mob retreated after cops threatened a lathi charge.

""We couldn't just stand and see a group of rioters come and set fire to houses before our eyes,"" Jadaun told TOI on Wednesday. ""When no one in the houses opened the doors, the mob was preparing to throw a bottle of petrol. Seeing this, we immediately made the decision to cross the border. I didn't think whether the house was in Delhi or Ghaziabad at the time or whether I have the jurisdiction to protect or not. As a police officer, it is my duty to protect every citizen of the country,"" he added.

Once the mob had retreated, the Ghaziabad police team went back to its post and did what protocol demanded: report the incident to Delhi Police. ""We called Delhi Police but they didn't respond to the situation. That was most surprising,"" Jadaun said.

Anjum said the Ghaziabad team got pelted with stones by the mob. ""But when police and the administration displayed unity to save the houses, the mob stopped and retreated. For the last two days, not a single cop from Delhi was deployed at the border to maintain law and order. When we called Delhi Police, they told us they were busy with security arrangements for the visit of (US President) Donald Trump. It was only on Tuesday night that senior Delhi policemen came to the Karawal Nagar-Lal Bagh border and appreciated the work done by Ghaziabad police and the administration,"" Anjum said.

But even after that, a fresh security threat cropped us as mobs from Delhi made multiple attempts to breach the barricades and create trouble in Lal Bagh. The first attempt was made around 10pm on Tuesday by a group of around 40. They were thwarted. Around midnight and 3am, two more mobs made similar attempts but were foiled both times. UP Police had increased deployment by then.

Ghaziabad SSP Kalanidhi Naithani told TOI, ""There are 10 major border points between Ghaziabad and Delhi. The sensitive areas are Tulsiniketan, Shalimar Garden, Loni and Lal Bagh."" No violence was reported in Ghaziabad where vigil has been stepped up in light of the Delhi riots.
