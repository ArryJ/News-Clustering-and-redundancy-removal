0,['1/02/2020'],We taught Auro to speak because he wasn’t barking: Rithvik Raja,"If you happen to scroll through the Insta stories of Carnatic musician Rithvik Raja and his classical dancer wife, Shweta Prachande , you would be certain to see more pictures of their darling pet Auro , a Golden Retriever , than of themselves. It doesn’t surprise us because when they speak about Auro, they come across as pet parents who are passionate about animals. We think that their calm nature has impacted Auro, too, as we hardly hear him bark during the course of the interview. “We were worried why he wasn’t barking. So, we taught him to speak (responding to sign language) because he wasn’t barking. And now, whenever we do a particular sign, he barks,” says Rithvik. Amid cuddles and lots of games, Rithvik and Shweta share their journey as pet parents...A friend of a friend had a litter of seven Goldens and Rithvik and Shweta had both decided to go there and play with the pups. “It just so happened that this guy (Auro) kept following me around. Seeing our love for pets , our friend asked if we wanted to adopt him. We wanted some time to think as we are artistes who travel a lot. Three days later, he sent four pups home, with Auro marked in a blue thread. While they all played with us, there was something about Auro, which made us decide to welcome him home,” says Rithvik.Shweta says, “Initially, we thought we’d get a trainer. But we wanted to give raising a pet a shot ourselves. We started reading and watching a lot videos to train him.” Rithvik acted as the trainer. “I am sure he thinks of me as a bullying monster,” he jokes. As for Shweta, she takes him on walks.“Auro is very intelligent. He is responsive to the atmosphere around him. A lot of students come home for classes. Some are OK with cuddling him, while others aren’t. He knows that and will just wag his tail as a sign of welcoming them home. Whenever I am practising, he will just sit next to the tanpura and begin to doze off,” says Rithvik.The couple says a lot has changed ever since Auro came home. “I am definitely more up on my feet,” says Shweta, “You start to work your schedule around him.” They also ensure he gets his regular exercise as Goldens tend to put on a lot of weight. “He loves Thayir Saadham and Sakkarai Pongal. No matter where he is, Auro will come near the refrigerator if someone opens the thayir paathiram. Sometimes, I give him boiled veggies. And he eats them only if I put a dollop of curd on them,” shares Shweta.Rithvik says he misses Auro the most when he is not in Chennai. “He’s always on my mind and I wonder if he’s had his food or if he’s sleeping well. I can’t really imagine a life without him. No matter what kind of a day I am having, when I get back, he brightens my day with his ‘welcome home’ love. Everything else becomes inconsequential when he’s with us,” he signs off.Rithvik says, “It is a myth they shed a lot. They will shed if they are unattended to. Once in 10 days, Shweta gives him a bath and combs with a furminator. It will hardly take 10 minutes of your time. Also, it is important to do research when you have a pet. What works for others may not work for you. The first two months are crucial and giving them the right food is a must.” He adds, “Also, please pick up your dog’s poop when you take them on walks on the road. There are some lovely devices. Lastly, ensure they get enough attention. They are just like kids.”Why the name Auro? “Just for the record, it has nothing to do with Auroville, in Pondicherry,” jokes Rithvik. He says they were looking for something more Indian and hyperlocal, but couldn’t settle on any particular one. They even thought of naming him after a raga. “But I don’t want to scream Kapi or Thodi on the road and no one responding to me,” laughs Shweta. In the end, it was she who came up with the name Auro, informs Rithvik. “Auro means gold-like in Italian,” reveals Shweta, who had been to Italy and was learning Italian at that point of time. “It refers to the character of a person. Given that he’s a Golden Retriever, it made absolute sense,” she explains.",entertainment,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73802157,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-1260996/73802157.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/tamil/music/we-taught-auro-to-speak-because-he-wasnt-barking-rithvik-raja/articleshow/73802172.cms

The actress has replaced Varsha, who quit the show for personal reasons. The soap opera, directed by Mussanje Mahesh , has Dileep R Shetty in the lead role.Speaking to us, Amrutha says, “I had been working continuously for the last seven years. After getting married, I wanted to spend some time with my family. Although I was getting offers to act in serials, nothing interested me.

She is a straight-forward girl, who speaks her mind.” When asked if it was challenging to portray a character, which was earlier played by Varsha, she says, “Not really.

2,['1/02/2020'],"My First Shot: For ADs, the formative years can become their identity, says SP Muthuraman","My first film as a director was Kanimuthu Paappa. It was written by VC Guhanathan, and was actually a multi-starrer — it featured Jaishankar, Muthuraman, Lakshmi, Jaya... Even Sridevi was a child artiste in the film. The first sequence that I shot for the film was a combination shot of Muthuraman and Jaishankar. Both were big heroes at that time and had equal footage in the film. We shot it in a studio in Chennai. Appollam ella padamumum studio-la dhaan eduppom.I started my career as an assistant director. Assistant directors and associate directors are like the right hand of a director. Whatever a director feels, we have to grasp it and convey it to the rest of the people on the set. Director Tirulokchandar is my guru. Whenever he had to go for a song recording, he would tell me, ‘Muthuraman, andha shot-a eduthurunga.’ So, even before I turned director, I’d canned so many shots as an assistant! And those days were truly a learning experience. I want those who are working as ADs to take their job seriously because these formative years can become their identity. I want to narrate an anecdote to supplement my statement. After Kanimuthu Paappa, Guhanathan had written a story for Jayalalithaa.Before he went to narrate it to her, he said that he was going to pitch my name as the director. I told him that she is a senior artiste and I was a newcomer, and if she was not comfortable with the idea of working with me, he should go ahead and rope in whoever she wanted to work with. Naan pudhusa vandhirukkaradhunala avangalukku oru thayakkam irukkalam. So, he went and met her and narrated the story, which she loved. When she asked who was going to direct it, Guhanathan mentioned my name. He said, ‘Muthuraman has directed Kanimuthu Paappa and has worked with AVM also. Aana ungalukku vera karuthu irundha sollunga.’ But she immediately told him, ‘Tirulokchandar oda assistant dhaane? I’ve seen him work on one of my films with Trilokchandar — Enga Mama. Avar nalla velai senjadha naan paathurukken. So, you give him the chance’. I got an opportunity to direct Jayalalithaa in Anbu Thangai only because she had seen me work hard as an assistant director. That’s why I want to tell all those who are working as ADs to give it their all, because they are being noticed for their work.",entertainment,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73803688,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-694084/73803688.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/tamil/movies/news/my-first-shot-for-ads-the-formative-years-can-become-their-identity-says-sp-muthuraman/articleshow/73803688.cms

10,['1/02/2020'],"I want to learn Sunil Chhetri's leadership skills, says Bala Devi","For an Indian athlete to break into the big league and make an international impression is quite a feat. And when it's a woman playing a sport that is traditionally thought to be male bastion, even more so. Naturally, 29-year-old Manipuri footballer and former national team captain Bala Devi's induction into the Scottish Women's Premier League is a big deal - something that she is both excited and nervous about. Getting to where she is today, though, she says is the fruition of a nearly two decade old dream. On the sidelines of the event announcing her move to the Rangers FC in Bengaluru, the footballer spoke to us about her journey in the sport, her dream come true and moreI am thankful and elated, as this has been my dream since childhood. I wanted to play football, reach a greater audience and play in a premier league someday. This contract is validation that I have got what I set out to achieve and I am, no doubt, glad.The 2002 FIFA Football World Cup set it up for me. I was 11 or 12 years old at the time and hooked to the television screen, as I watched Ronaldinho and Ronaldo score goal after goal. I knew I wanted to be like them and even had posters of them at my house for a while. .I come from a small village in Manipur. I still remember that when I started out, people used to tell my father that he should not let me play football and to instead get me to focus on studies. But I always knew that I would someday show them what I can achieve. Deep down I knew that I will bring my village and my country into the spotlight. And now, they all support me.Not at all. In my family, everyone is in sports. One of my brothers is a bodybuilder, while the other plays football. My twin sister used to play football like me, but gave up along the way. I used to play with the boys in my neighbourhood and beat them at their game. So, I was taught by everyone and sports was something that sort of defined all of us. In fact, my father used to coach me, so there was no issue in pursuing my passion at home. .When I started out, I used to play with seniors and learnt from their experience. Over the years, I have grown as a player and as a senior member of the teams I play for, I am able to impart whatever I learnt to the younger ones, while also handling team management, etc. I now know what it takes to represent one's country and teach that to the younger players. The technical wisdom of the years of experience apart, now, when I go to the field, I am always at ease and don't get agitated. Leadership is something that I am still learning.The government has been extremely supportive, in the sense that we don't have to take on work stress. We have to just focus on sports.The scene has changed drastically since 2002. Now, people know what a huge platform sports and government support has also been phenomenal - be it in terms of infrastructure, finance or other benefits.There's a lot of potential in the upcoming players, especially the U-17 players. They have what it takes to take India to greater heights at the upcoming U-17 Women's World Cup.Sunil Chhetri. He is extremely cool and composed and his leadership skills are something that I want to imbibe in my day-to-day activities.If not this then I would have joined the Indian Navy. I love the discipline and how cool and smart Navy personnel look. (Laughs).I am not looking at challenges. The only thing I am focused on right now is that I need to give my 100% there. I think it is going to be a great experience to meet and play with players from different parts of the world and be a part of Rangers FC as a family. If I begin to think about the difficulties and challenges ahead, I will limit myself, so I won't do that.I just love the city! I keep coming here for my fitness and performance training and I just love the weather and the food.

The model-turned-actress has now come out accusing Tharshan of harassing her mentally and physically. The Sawaari star says that they were engaged much before the show took off, but Tharshan started behaving rudely once he came out of the reality show.She explains, “I got engaged to Tharshan before the show started. At that time, he’d asked me not to talk about it, and I complied. We had made plans to get married in June. But he started behaving indifferently after the show. He avoided me, humiliated me, and I was harassed mentally and physically. I was also threatened by his family.

She adds that Tharshan kept accusing her of having affairs with her co-stars. “He knew that I’m an actress. It’s I who did everything for him.

16,['1/02/2020'],Women activists heckle Post Card founder Mahesh Hegde at MIA,"This story is from February 1, 2020

MANGALURU: After comedian Kunal Kamra ’s run-in with Republic editor Arnab Goswami in air, action returned to terra firma with women activists heckling founder of Post Card Mahesh Vikram Hegde at Mangaluru international airport on Friday. The activists – Kavitha Reddy, Amulya Leona and Najma Nazeer – took turns to heckle Hegde for more than 30 minutes as he waited to board an IndiGo flight to Bengaluru as the latter maintained his composure amidst this incident in public glare.

Noting that the incident took place sometime between 8.15am to 8.45am when he boarded the flight, Hegde told TOI that the women activists perhaps chose the airport than resort to a la Kunal Kamra type of approach lest they too be put on the no-fly list. Incidentally, the activists who had participated in an anti CAA/NRC protest rally at Town Hall on Thursday were on the same flight as Hegde and made no approach towards him in the flight or after they landed in Bengaluru.

Noting they asked him to sing ‘Nada Geethe’, Vande Matharam, Sare Jahan Se Achcha so that he could prove his credentials as a ‘nationalist’, Hegde said the incident was much more that the small 2-minute-odd clip that has gone viral due to the Tweet by one of the activists. Asserting that they bore a grudge for ‘torture’ they underwent because of him on Facebook , Hegde said he never individually attacked any of these three, but has gone full throttle against the ‘Tukde Tukde’ gang.

“I am always opposed to the likes of Kanhaiya Kumar,” Hegde said adding he too could have asked the trio lots of questions of his own. “This was neither the occasion nor the place for it,” Hegde said adding that their act was akin to batting maestro Sachin Tendulkar asking Indian skipper Virat Kohli to hit a six at an airport and not at the stadium. Even fans of comedian Kapil Sharma expect him to act out a comic scene wherever they meet him, Hegde said in defence of his silence.

With the incident going viral on Twitter and video clips on WhatsApp, both supporters and opponents of Hegde jumped to his support or hailed the activists for their boldness in showing mirror to the face of this journalist. Immaturity of the activists stood out in them asking him to sing Vandhe Matharam , Hegde said adding for person with common sense would know one who attends RSS shaka will know this song. They do not come to a shaka to see what happens and harbor their notions, he added.

18,['1/02/2020'],Zakir Hussain: Ustad Zakir Hussain: To be able to feel young again is like a new lease of life,"For someone who has been playing on stage professionally for almost six decades now, globally, Ustad Zakir Hussain ’s sheer enthusiasm for his craft, even now, is awe-inspiring. Seated comfortably in his pretty SoBo apartment, the legendary musician talks to BT about the events planned for Abbaji’s (his late father, the legendary Ustad Allarakha ) upcoming barsi (which is in its 20th year), why he marvels at the composers of today, how being a, “travelling musician” keeps him away from Bollywood, and what keeps him busy when he is not on stage. Read on…In its 20th year, the dawn-to-dusk event, A Homage to Abbaji – Ustad Allarakha , has always seen some of the greatest luminaries of Indian music on stage, and this year will be no different. What’s special is that Abbaji’s sons, Zakir-Taufiq-Fazal, who have not played together on stage for the last three decades, will perform at the upcoming event. Sharing his excitement, Zakir Hussain says, “Fazal, Taufiq and I are going to make a presentation in the second session, Taal Tapasya. It’s almost been 28-30 years since we have played together. I’m very happy that I will get to perform with my brothers on February 3.” The homage concert will also ring in the beginning of the centenary year of Pandit Ravi Shankar . Elaborating on this, he adds, “It’s great that one is finishing and the other is starting and it all coincides well. We are trying to figure out how to find more space on stage. There are so many musicians coming in, including Hollywood music composer Greg Ellis, Salim-Sulaiman, Louiz Banks, Sheldon, Gino Banks, Sanjay Divecha, Darshan, sitarist Purbayan Chatterjee and George Brooks. I will also be performing with Suresh Wadkar and his students.”Zakir Hussain feels that it is not easy for a classical musician to work in Bollywood. He explains, “Being an Indian classical musician, you have a certain amount of spontaneity in your DNA and you are impulsive in your creativity. And being an Indian classical performer, you also have a certain amount of vanity and ego, ‘I know what I am doing, I’m a composer and an artiste, etc.’ When you sit in a music room with a producer and an actor, and they hand you something that they have heard and say, ‘I want something like this’, then your sensibility as an artiste comes into question. For an Indian classical artiste, it is harder to be able to break away from that kind of mindset and say, ‘Yes, sure, I can copy this out’. For this, you require a special kind of person, who can not only maintain the integrity of his or her own creativity, but at the same time, be able to satisfy the needs of whatever the producer or director wants. I marvel at musicians and composers today; how they are able to deliver what is needed and what is wanted, keep their creative process in check and not feel like they are being choked. Shankar- Ehsaan-Loy (SEL), for instance. Shankar is a classically trained musician, Ehsaan is a great blues guitarist and so is Loy. They have found an incredible balance where they are able to sneak in at least one very interesting tune that is, you know, ‘aaah SEL’. Salim-Sulaiman and Vishal Shekhar , all these guys also do that. And that kind of temperament is something that an Indian classical musician has a hard time with. I saw that with Shiv-Hari ( Pandit Shivkumar Sharma and Pandit Hariprasad Chaurasia ), and they finally had to give up Bollywood. My father did music for about 40 Bollywood films, at a time when music was more classically oriented. But even he started facing situations where his integrity as an artiste, to him, came into question. And that was it. It was over. He just wanted to play Indian classical music. I totally admit my shortcoming, which is not being able to cope with the requirements of being a Bollywood film composer. I only do these independent, smaller projects like Aparna Sen’s movie or Rahul Bose’s film. In that situation, the collaboration is at a different level because it is a small project and the time sequences are in place. This has got nothing to do with the process that a Bollywood film goes through in order to create work. It is just the way I am.”Tabla players are no longer considered just accompanying musicians, they are as much lead as the vocalists and instrumentalists. Zakir Hussain believes that this was true even back in the days. “I think, 35-40 years ago, too, they were doing what they are doing now. Only that now, there is more visibility and far more focus on what artistes are doing. Today’s artiste is not just a performing artiste, but also a networking artiste and knows how to project his or her musical life, in a more magnified manner. Therefore, more and more people know what each musician is doing. That makes the information much more readily available, so the assumption is that this is happening now and that it never happened before. But that isn’t the case. My father, for instance. He played with so many great artistes as an accompanist, but at the same time, he also played an equal number of solo concerts. He was a leader. Then, he also did taal vadya concerts where he led the concerts. There were many tabla players who played a lot of solo concerts as lead artistes. Ustad Ahmed Jan Thirakwa did hundreds of solo concerts and so did Pt Kishan Maharaj and Pt Samta Prasad. The recognition of tabla players today is on a more all-round level than it was before.”While most of us know about Zakir Hussain the musician, not many know who he is when he is not on stage or in the media glare. “How a regular day in my life is, depends on where I am at that moment. If I am at home, in California, there is a certain amount of freedom in terms of doing things that involve the outdoors. I go to the hills, walk the trails, do five-six-mile hikes. I go to the beach, walk around, sit and watch sunsets. Sometimes, I go to the East side and look at the full moon rise. It is beautiful. Doing outdoor things is something that I really like. Apart from that, I love to cook. When I am in Mumbai, I am not even allowed in the kitchen, but abroad, I am not only allowed to cook, but also allowed to do the dishes (laughs!) In India, I’m mostly indoors, and I read, practise and compose. But what is really close to me is walking about in nature, soaking in the sun and realising that each sunrise and sunset is so different and beautiful that I am never going to see that one again.”The maestro, who is loved the world over, is a complete homebody at heart. Even while his calendar remains choc-o-bloc all year round, he ensures that for all the birthdays, anniversaries, New Year and Christmas celebrations, he is home. However, earlier, it wasn’t so. “In my younger days, I used to be gone for three-to-four months and my father was the same way. Once, when he left for a concert, my head was under his chin and when he came back, I was taller than him. When I was young, I couldn’t afford to come back home between tours. But now, even if I have three days off between tours, I go back home. I have a four-and-a-half-year-old granddaughter in Los Angeles and to be able to spend time with her is important to me. To be able to feel young again is a new concept to me, it’s like a new lease of life. And those kinds of things are precious and should be enjoyed to its maximum.”",entertainment,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73798913,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-78617/73798913.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/hindi/music/news/ustad-zakir-hussain-to-be-able-to-feel-young-again-is-like-a-new-lease-of-life/articleshow/73798913.cms

‘UP Cricket Association should conduct inter-school cricket tournaments’

Syed Mujtaba Hussain Kirmani (BCCL/ Farhan Ahmad Siddiqui)

‘Why team India doesn’t have a wicket-keeping coach?’

‘You can not be on top at all times, there have to be failures’

‘We never had a coach, but we still won the World Cup’

Veteran cricketer and former wicket keeper of the Indian cricket team, Syed Mujtaba Hussain Kirmani , was in Lucknow recently. The cricketer, who is full of praises for the city, recalled his last visit to Lucknow nearly two decades ago. “I have been to Lucknow on many occasions before also but as far as cricket goes, I have played the Indian veteran cricketers versus Pakistan veteran cricketers match here in Lucknow in the late ’80s. It’s a lovely city. Saari duniya mein yeh bohot hi mashhoor baat hai ki yahan pe khaane-peene ke jo lawazimaat bante hain, they are very tasty and very rich. Aur jo yahan ka nawabi culture hai, aur yahaan ki jo zubaan hai bohot hi fasih (popular) zubaan hai. Aur jo akhlaq yahan ke hain, manners, the respect and regards for seniors and elders is tremendous.” Then, giving a mock salute, he adds, “Lucknow ke log jo ek doosre ke liye respect aur regard rakkhte hain, usey maanna padega.”Talking about cricketers from UP and the potential of the youngsters here, Kirmani said there are many Indian cricketers from the state like Suresh Raina , Mohamad Kaif, Piyush Chawla and there could be quite a few more also. “But you could be rest assured that there is no dearth of talent in our country. The talent has to be initiated from the school level. The UP Cricket Association should conduct inter-school cricket tournaments in the age group of 12-16 and from that competition you will get a lot of hidden talent,” advises the veteran cricketer, adding, “And this is how it should start off to unearth and groom talent because this is the grooming place for the young cricketers to go and play the higher standards of the game and climb the ladder of success. From here, the right talent has to be picked, taken into the state academy like we have in Karnataka, the cricket academy.”Speaking about the changes in the game since he played active cricket, Kirmani says the biggest honour for him was when the team had won the World Cup in 1983. “My personal achievement was being awarded the Best Wicket Keeper in the world from 1979 to 1986 and it was given by none other than the all-time great wicket-keeper from England, Godfrey Evans. But it is very unfortunate that nobody mentions this. Everyone talks about the 175 knock of Kapil Dev in the Zimbabwe match which was unfortunately not recorded for television. That was the most crucial match for the Indian team during the 1983 World Cup matches to qualify for semis and the finals. This was the biggest and the most devastating and the best innings I have ever seen from the bat of Kapil Dev who scored 175, and everyone talks about that but nobody talks about who gave him the support; Yours sincerely,” says Kirmani, pointing towards himself.He goes on to add, “We were 17 for five and 120 for eight when I walked in. And we had the partnership going for the eight wicket of 128 runs. If I had not given that stand to Kapil Dev we wouldn’t have won the World Cup. Nevertheless, it does not matter to me as long as the country has won the World Cup. It is just that not many know that I had been awarded the Best Wicket Keeper in the World award.”Syed Mujtaba Hussain Kirmani (BCCL/ Farhan Ahmad Siddiqui)And while team India already has a bowling coach, a batting and also a fielding coach, there's no one to coach wicket keepers. Laughing out loud, the cricketer says, “I am asking the same question as to why team India doesn’t have a wicket-keeping coach, which is the most important place in cricket. Wicket keeping is not like batting or bowling or fielding. It according to me holds the most important place in cricket and so you got to have a wicket-keeping coach. When you can add these three areas, bowling, batting and fielding why not wicket keeping which is the most crucial place in cricket? Any team can walk in without a bowler without a batsman and without an all-rounder but they can not walk in without a wicket keeper. So on that count, I think that a wicket-keeping coach is a must. Because you can not get away by saying that it is a result-oriented thing so, no technique is required in wicket keeping,” says Kirmani, adding, “We have never been given an opportunity by the board of my own state to coach upcoming promising wicket keepers. This is the least that I can do to give back to this great game of cricket whatever little experience I have gained from my 50 years of experience. So now it’s my appeal to the president of the Board of Control for Cricket in India Sourav Ganguly , my dear friend, get me some place to share my experiences with the youngsters, particularly in the wicket keeping aspect. I would like to train these youngsters how to become good gentleman cricketers. This is the least I can do. The way I have been groomed, the way I have seen success.”Answering the question of why Indian cricket team has not been able to win the World Cup since 2011, Kirmani says that after the Indian team won the World Cup in 1983 – the first-ever World Cup won by the Indian team – it took 28 years for the next Indian team to win the next World Cup in 2011 where MS Dhoni was the captain. “You can not expect a team to be the world champion at all times. There were instances like West Indies, who ruled cricket for nearly two decades, they won the inaugural 1975, they won the 1979 World Cup and we broke the hoodoo by beating them in 1983. After 28 years India won and then it is a matter of luck, the matter of application and it is the matter of how you progress in the entire tournament. In 1983 nobody expected the Indian team to even qualify, even we did not think that. But there were some very finer points of the games through which we had a belief in ourselves. We believed in our capability. In this great game of cricket, this is the bottom line, which has its glorious uncertainties. You can not be on top at all times, there have to be failures which are part and parcel of this great game of cricket. So I suppose this was the part and parcel of the Indian team which could not win the World Cup which went by.”Talking about the techniques getting updated today and also increase in sledging on ground, Kirmani laughs and says, “Indeed from our time to this era of cricket, there has been a vast change in this game. We never had a coach, but we still won the World Cup. We just had a manager, we had an assistant manager to take care of our travel. And now you have got eight support staff. Globally, in each and every team, there is so much of technology which has gone into this game and in our times, I suppose, we played like gentleman cricketers. I can very proudly say that we never sort of abused any player, we appreciated each and everybody’s good efforts. We never cursed any bowler or any batsman. If you see the videos of our entire 1970 to 1986 matches, the bowlers were so well mannered, just taking wickets. Like when Kapil Dev took 8 wickets, he never ran around the ground with all the players running behind him. There was no television or such media in our time. So the time has changed but the gentlemanliness according to me, with due respect to the gentlemen who aäre globally in each and every team, the gentlemanliness is gone from the game, according to me. The proof is that fines are being imposed upon cricketers because they abuse, mics are put behind wickets or inside the ground, the third umpire is there. We never had such neutral umpires also and there was so much biased feelings among the umpires in our time. New Zealand umpires would not give out to Glenn Turner who was their best batsmen. Viv Richards, they would never give out to him when he was stumped by Bishan Singh Bedi even though he was yards out just because the umpire was a big fan of Viv Richards and wanted to see him score a 100. So there was partiality in our time. Yes, changes have to come in. In our time it was 60 overs to start with in the first World Cup in 1975.Then came 50 overs and now it is 20 overs, and talk of 10 overs is also going on. So good changes have taken place, there’s no two ways about it. But according to me, that gentlemanliness is gone from the team. Each tournament is like a war now and not appreciating each others’ good work. If a batsman hits you for a six on a good length delivery, the bowler gives a ride look at the batsman and then he bowls a bouncer to him trying to injure him. It’s now a game of one upmanship.”— With inputs from Farhan Ahmad Siddiqui",sports,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73804968,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-384948,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//sports/off-the-field/we-never-had-a-coach-but-we-still-won-the-world-cup-syed-mujtaba-hussain-kirmani/articleshow/73804912.cms

The film’s lead actor Aditya Roy Kapur , who was recently in Delhi with the rest of the team, does not disagree with the masala tag but adds that there is much more to the film. “I think it is easy to label it as masala and there is nothing wrong with that term,"" he says, adding, ""But I think there is also a lot of interesting stuff set in the real world. There are a lot of interesting characters; a lot of thought has got into the screenplay.""When we sit down with the star cast of the film – Aditya, Disha Patani Kunal Kemmu and Anil Kapoor – they stress that the film has something new and fresh, despite being, in their words, a ""romantic action-thriller"". Kunal says, ""You see a lot of action in the trailer of the film, but for all of us it was more emotional than physical at times. There is so much in the film that would emotionally and mentally drain you, but it’s so special for an actor to get an opportunity to do that.""Even Anil Kapoor, who has a much larger body of work as compared to the other actors, says there was a chance to do something new for him here. ""There are a lot of things in this film everyone is doing for the first time. As an actor I try not to repeat what I have already done. It might look a little jaded.""Sunny days are back: Kunal Kemmu and Anil KapoorThe veteran actor adds, ""When filmmakers make these kind of stories, they cast people who are new and fresh, which adds to the freshness to the film, and then surround them by people who are slightly more experienced. It is that kind of a film where it has got experience as well as freshness, so it becomes a good package.""Recently, Disha said that she was inspired by Angelina Jolie for her grey character in this film. Talking to us, all the four actors say they channel their favourite action stars while doing action. ""For me, it's Schwarzenegger, Stallone, Van Damme and Jackie Chan,"" says Aditya, elaborating on how he grew up devouring films by these action legends. ""I've watched their whole filmographies. I've even seen Jackie Chan's badly-dubbed Chinese movies. I grew up watching them and loved them,"" he says. Disha shares, ""For sure, Jackie Chan and Angelina (Jolie). I've grown up with Jackie Chan's films. I think nobody can touch what he has done. That's why he is a legend. It's not easy to do comedy with action. When you do action, the last thing you think about is your expression. It’s so hard to think about how to make it funny.""Ladki beautiful: Disha PataniFor Anil Kapoor, the definitive action star today is someone who he has worked with in the past – Tom Cruise. ""At the moment, when you think action and a leading man, someone who has remained a leading man for 30-35 years now, is Tom Cruise. He looks good, does all his stunts and he is still one of the biggest stars. I think Tom Cruise is someone I really look up to where action is concerned,"" he tells us.Kunal, however, finds his idols closer home. ""For me it's Dharmendra, Amitabh Bachchan , Sunny Deol and Nagarjuna. That's how I wanted to be as an actor,"" he says, going back to Nagarjuna's iconic fight scene from the 1989 hit Shiva. ""I remember in Shiva, when Nagarjuna takes out that cycle chain, it just became iconic,"" he says.When it comes to the younger actors, most online news articles on them use adjectives like 'hot', 'stylish', and 'chiseled'. But very rarely are words like 'talented' used. The actors say it's a direct result of them being active on social media more than the previous generation of actors. Disha says, ""When your film comes out, that's the only time when people can talk about your talent. But I think it's fine. That's how the world works."" Aditya adds that they have all become more vain as a result of trying to constantly look good for social media. He says, ""Instagram has changed the world in the last five years. It's gotten people to be more conscious about how they look. We are more vain, maybe, in general. Earlier, being vain was not seen as a good quality. But now, people unabashedly want to look good. That was looked down upon ten years ago. It's just a sign of the times. That's why people keep talking about how everyone is looking all the time. There's no use trying to fight it.""Kunal admits that initially, he tried posting pictures he had clicked instead of his own pictures on social media, only to be admonished by friends. ""Honestly, when Instagram came around, I thought it's for photographers to put stuff up and I started doing that. People asked me, 'What are you doing? Why are you taking pictures of buildings, doors, flowers? This is not what it is. The camera is supposed to be facing the other way,'"" he says with a laugh. Aditya adds, ""I think that’s how it started. Now it has turned into this beast. It's a lookbook of sorts. It's your personal portfolio. People say, 'You're so boring. Put up pictures of yourself na!' It's just the times we live in.""",entertainment,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73801373,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-273703/73801373.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/hindi/bollywood/news/team-malang-the-film-was-more-draining-emotionally-than-physically/articleshow/73801140.cms

‘UP Cricket Association should conduct inter-school cricket tournaments’

‘My personal achievement was being awarded the Best Wicket Keeper in the world from 1979 to 1986’

Syed Mujtaba Hussain Kirmani (BCCL/ Farhan Ahmad Siddiqui)

‘Why team India doesn’t have a wicket-keeping coach?’

‘You can not be on top at all times, there have to be failures’

‘We never had a coach, but we still won the World Cup’

Veteran cricketer and former wicket keeper of the Indian cricket team, Syed Mujtaba Hussain Kirmani , was in Lucknow recently. The cricketer, who is full of praises for the city, recalled his last visit to Lucknow nearly two decades ago. “I have been to Lucknow on many occasions before also but as far as cricket goes, I have played the Indian veteran cricketers versus Pakistan veteran cricketers match here in Lucknow in the late ’80s. It’s a lovely city. Saari duniya mein yeh bohot hi mashhoor baat hai ki yahan pe khaane-peene ke jo lawazimaat bante hain, they are very tasty and very rich. Aur jo yahan ka nawabi culture hai, aur yahaan ki jo zubaan hai bohot hi fasih (popular) zubaan hai. Aur jo akhlaq yahan ke hain, manners, the respect and regards for seniors and elders is tremendous.” Then, giving a mock salute, he adds, “Lucknow ke log jo ek doosre ke liye respect aur regard rakkhte hain, usey maanna padega.”Talking about cricketers from UP and the potential of the youngsters here, Kirmani said there are many Indian cricketers from the state like Suresh Raina , Mohamad Kaif, Piyush Chawla and there could be quite a few more also. “But you could be rest assured that there is no dearth of talent in our country. The talent has to be initiated from the school level. The UP Cricket Association should conduct inter-school cricket tournaments in the age group of 12-16 and from that competition you will get a lot of hidden talent,” advises the veteran cricketer, adding, “And this is how it should start off to unearth and groom talent because this is the grooming place for the young cricketers to go and play the higher standards of the game and climb the ladder of success. From here, the right talent has to be picked, taken into the state academy like we have in Karnataka, the cricket academy.”Speaking about the changes in the game since he played active cricket, Kirmani says the biggest honour for him was when the team had won the World Cup in 1983. “My personal achievement was being awarded the Best Wicket Keeper in the world from 1979 to 1986 and it was given by none other than the all-time great wicket-keeper from England, Godfrey Evans. But it is very unfortunate that nobody mentions this. Everyone talks about the 175 knock of Kapil Dev in the Zimbabwe match which was unfortunately not recorded for television. That was the most crucial match for the Indian team during the 1983 World Cup matches to qualify for semis and the finals. This was the biggest and the most devastating and the best innings I have ever seen from the bat of Kapil Dev who scored 175, and everyone talks about that but nobody talks about who gave him the support; Yours sincerely,” says Kirmani, pointing towards himself.He goes on to add, “We were 17 for five and 120 for eight when I walked in. And we had the partnership going for the eight wicket of 128 runs. If I had not given that stand to Kapil Dev we wouldn’t have won the World Cup. Nevertheless, it does not matter to me as long as the country has won the World Cup. It is just that not many know that I had been awarded the Best Wicket Keeper in the World award.”Syed Mujtaba Hussain Kirmani (BCCL/ Farhan Ahmad Siddiqui)And while team India already has a bowling coach, a batting and also a fielding coach, there's no one to coach wicket keepers. Laughing out loud, the cricketer says, “I am asking the same question as to why team India doesn’t have a wicket-keeping coach, which is the most important place in cricket. Wicket keeping is not like batting or bowling or fielding. It according to me holds the most important place in cricket and so you got to have a wicket-keeping coach. When you can add these three areas, bowling, batting and fielding why not wicket keeping which is the most crucial place in cricket? Any team can walk in without a bowler without a batsman and without an all-rounder but they can not walk in without a wicket keeper. So on that count, I think that a wicket-keeping coach is a must. Because you can not get away by saying that it is a result-oriented thing so, no technique is required in wicket keeping,” says Kirmani, adding, “We have never been given an opportunity by the board of my own state to coach upcoming promising wicket keepers. This is the least that I can do to give back to this great game of cricket whatever little experience I have gained from my 50 years of experience. So now it’s my appeal to the president of the Board of Control for Cricket in India Sourav Ganguly , my dear friend, get me some place to share my experiences with the youngsters, particularly in the wicket keeping aspect. I would like to train these youngsters how to become good gentleman cricketers. This is the least I can do. The way I have been groomed, the way I have seen success.”Answering the question of why Indian cricket team has not been able to win the World Cup since 2011, Kirmani says that after the Indian team won the World Cup in 1983 – the first-ever World Cup won by the Indian team – it took 28 years for the next Indian team to win the next World Cup in 2011 where MS Dhoni was the captain. “You can not expect a team to be the world champion at all times. There were instances like West Indies, who ruled cricket for nearly two decades, they won the inaugural 1975, they won the 1979 World Cup and we broke the hoodoo by beating them in 1983. After 28 years India won and then it is a matter of luck, the matter of application and it is the matter of how you progress in the entire tournament. In 1983 nobody expected the Indian team to even qualify, even we did not think that. But there were some very finer points of the games through which we had a belief in ourselves. We believed in our capability. In this great game of cricket, this is the bottom line, which has its glorious uncertainties. You can not be on top at all times, there have to be failures which are part and parcel of this great game of cricket. So I suppose this was the part and parcel of the Indian team which could not win the World Cup which went by.”Talking about the techniques getting updated today and also increase in sledging on ground, Kirmani laughs and says, “Indeed from our time to this era of cricket, there has been a vast change in this game. We never had a coach, but we still won the World Cup. We just had a manager, we had an assistant manager to take care of our travel. And now you have got eight support staff. Globally, in each and every team, there is so much of technology which has gone into this game and in our times, I suppose, we played like gentleman cricketers. I can very proudly say that we never sort of abused any player, we appreciated each and everybody’s good efforts. We never cursed any bowler or any batsman. If you see the videos of our entire 1970 to 1986 matches, the bowlers were so well mannered, just taking wickets. Like when Kapil Dev took 8 wickets, he never ran around the ground with all the players running behind him. There was no television or such media in our time. So the time has changed but the gentlemanliness according to me, with due respect to the gentlemen who aäre globally in each and every team, the gentlemanliness is gone from the game, according to me. The proof is that fines are being imposed upon cricketers because they abuse, mics are put behind wickets or inside the ground, the third umpire is there. We never had such neutral umpires also and there was so much biased feelings among the umpires in our time. New Zealand umpires would not give out to Glenn Turner who was their best batsmen. Viv Richards, they would never give out to him when he was stumped by Bishan Singh Bedi even though he was yards out just because the umpire was a big fan of Viv Richards and wanted to see him score a 100. So there was partiality in our time. Yes, changes have to come in. In our time it was 60 overs to start with in the first World Cup in 1975.Then came 50 overs and now it is 20 overs, and talk of 10 overs is also going on. So good changes have taken place, there’s no two ways about it. But according to me, that gentlemanliness is gone from the team. Each tournament is like a war now and not appreciating each others’ good work. If a batsman hits you for a six on a good length delivery, the bowler gives a ride look at the batsman and then he bowls a bouncer to him trying to injure him. It’s now a game of one upmanship.”— With inputs from Farhan Ahmad Siddiqui",lucknow,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73804968,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-384948,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/we-never-had-a-coach-but-we-still-won-the-world-cup-syed-mujtaba-hussain-kirmani/articleshow/73805085.cms

Multiple studies suggest that a balanced diet full of veggies, fruits and antioxidant-rich food can reduce stress & anxiety levelsWhat you eat affects not just our physical health, but mental health, too, by influencing our mood. A new study published in the journal European Neuropsychopharmacology established a link between poor diet and the worsening of mood disorders, including anxiety and depression. According to researchers, the link between diet and mental health can be firmly established in certain cases like the impact of Vitamin B12 deficiency on depression, among other things.Nutritionists and health experts tell us about the food items that one must incorporate in their daily diet for the overall well-being of an individual.Ashwagandha, also known as Indian ginseng or winter cherry, is a popular supplement with medicinal properties that can help in reducing stress and anxiety. Lovneet says, ""Indian adaptogens like ashwagandha and brahmi can be had in a fat medium, either in milk or coconut oil mixed in warm water (if you are lactose intolerant), or ghee. A single root of ashwagandha can help in tackling stress or anxiety, and improve your mental health by balancing the spiked up cortisol levels, which is a stress hormone.""Items of nuts and seeds family, pumpkin seeds, lentils, cashews and peanuts that are rich in magnesium help in relaxing muscles and act as a mood stabiliser, resulting in overall mental well-being.The deficiency of serotonin (a monoamine neurotransmitter, that contribute towards feelings of well-being and happiness) can lead to depression. Bananas are rich in tryptophan, which is converted to serotonin.Studies suggest that fish oil contains omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), and PUFAs are known to induce an antidepressant effect. Vegans or vegetarians can buy algae plant oil, which is packed with omega-3 fatty acids that help in fighting depression.You feel full and energetic for a couple of hours after having these complex carbs as they help in providing a sustained energy resource, which is needed when you are dealing with stress, anxiety and depression. Lentils are a rich source of magnesium, and the fibre helps in improving gut health. Having enough amount of soluble fibre soups ensures the environment inside your intestine is alkaline and helps in the absorption of other nutrients, which improves gut health. That, in turn, improves one’s mental health.Depression could be a condition because of an existing, underlying condition, it could be post-partum or because of the thyroid. The reasons can vary. ""So knowing the cause of your anxiety or depression helps in food intervention. If you have thyroid, and if you feel fatigued as soon as you wake up, and if that’s the reason for feeling blue, then having dairy products like milk and yogurt helps as it is rich iniodine and helps in beating stress and anxiety,"" says Lovneet.Nutritionist and health coach Tapasya Mundhra suggests people suffering from mental health issues should restrict the consumption of these foodStudies have shown that negative mood-related drinking can make people vulnerable to developing both major depression and alcoholdependenceSeveral studies suggest that the intake of sweet food, beverages and added sugars has been linked with depressive symptoms in several populationsCaffeine brings down the serotonin levels in the brain, studies suggest.

‘Effect of curbs opposite of what was intended’

NEW DELHI: The Economic Survey for 2019-20, released on Friday, continues the post-liberalisation tradition of pushing for pro-market reforms, but arguably with greater vehemence than ever before.More importantly, its source for inspiration in this direction is not, unlike in the past, the experience of other fast-growing economies like the Asian tigers but India’s own past. The author of the Survey argues strongly that India’s civilizational ethos has celebrated wealth creators and that this is what had allowed the country to be the “dominant economic power globally” for “more than three-fourths of known economic history”.India’s four-decade long ‘dalliance with socialism’, the Survey maintains, was an aberration from this norm of relying on “the invisible hand of the market for wealth creation with the support of the hand of trust”.Citing Kautilya and Thiruvalluvar liberally, the Economic Survey for 2019-20 makes a case that ethical entrepreneurship was India’s intrinsic genius and a return to it is what would allow it to once again shine on the world stage.The hands-off prescription extends to doing away with the Essential Commodities Act, government intervention in grain markets, and even drug price regulation, an area in which the current government boasts of having pushed the envelope. In each case, it argues, the actual effect of regulation was the opposite of what was intended, making controlled items costlier and in short supply. In the same vein, the Survey suggests that debt waivers were counter-productive.Acknowledging the slowdown in the economy, which it attributes to the financial sector dragging down the real economy, the Survey observes, “Considering the urgent priority of the government to revive growth in the economy, the fiscal deficit target may have to be relaxed for the current year.”It argues for an aggressive push to disinvestment in PSUs in the coming year, pointing out that the strong mandate to the government gives it the ability to undertake bold reforms. Public sector banks are cited as examples of inefficiency and wealth destruction. Yet, the Survey stops short of calling for their privatisation, instead suggesting steps that need to be taken to make them “more efficient so that they are able to adeptly support the nation in its march towards being a $5 trillion economy”.The Survey makes a bold statement, saying the government could explore the privatisation of education at all levels to augment capacity. It calls for a boost for labour-intensive exports by making ‘Assemble-in-India’ an extension of Make in India. The Survey coins the term “Thalinomics”, dedicating a chapter to the idea. It tries to establish that steps taken by the government to moderate inflation have made the common thali more affordable for working people than would otherwise have been the case.Beyond this broad thrust of enabling a market-driven economy with a strong underpinning of trust, the Survey exudes optimism about the future suggesting the economy would grow between 6% and 6.5% in the coming year. It also seeks to refute suggestions that India’s GDP numbers are questionable.Overall, the Survey makes it clear that wealth creators need not be viewed with suspicion and markets are best left to govern themselves with governments only making sure rogue elements don’t undermine trust. It attempts to “put to rest any scepticism about the benefits accruing from a market economy, both in economic thinking and policymaking” and emphasises the idea of “trust as a public good that gets enhanced with greater use”.Referring to trade agreements, the Survey departs from official thinking, saying exports have received a greater boost from such agreements than imports.",business,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73818916,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-591624,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/economic-survey-pitches-reforms-says-free-market-part-of-indias-ethos/articleshow/73818894.cms

Trial court cites prison rules, says 3 convicts can’t be hanged separately

NEW DELHI: Redress of grievances through procedure established by law is the hallmark of any civilised society, said a Delhi court on Friday and “postponed till further orders” hanging of the four convicts in the 2012 Nirbhaya case.Additional sessions judge Dharmendra Rana stated, “The courts of this country cannot afford to adversely discriminate against any convict, including death row convicts, in pursuit of his legal remedies by turning a Nelson’s eye towards him.”Special prosecutor Irfan Ahmed said that Mukesh had exhausted all his constitutional and legal remedies and the mercy plea of another convict Vinay Kumar Sharma was pending. In case of the other two, Pawan and Akshay, there weren’t any pleas pending. The state prosecutor, therefore, said that barring Vinay, the other three men could be hanged on February 1.Ahmed submitted that any relief to the three convicts apart from Sharma was tantamount to abuse of the process of law and lead to travesty of justice.The court, however, dealt with the prosecution’s contention stating that Rule 836 of the Delhi Prison Rules provided that if an appeal or an application is made by only one convict, the execution of sentence shall be postponed in the case of co-convicts. Appearing for the three convicts — Sharma, Gupta and Thakur — advocate A P Singh argued that while Sharma’s mercy plea had been filed, convict Thakur intended to file a mercy plea before the President of India.Amicus curiae Vrinda Grover and advocate Soutik Banerjee, who appeared for convict Mukesh, submitted that the convict had been “earnestly” and “sincerely” pursuing his legal remedies without any unnecessary delay.Grover stressed that since all convicts were held guilty for the same offence and were convicted by a common judgment their fate could not be segregated and convict Mukesh’s case couldn’t be dealt with separately.Grover relied on a precedent of the Supreme Court in the matter of Harbans Singh versus the state of UP to contend that the execution of the death sentence would lead to an “irreversible and irreparable” process. She also argued that in case the mercy plea of similarly placed convicts is favourably considered by the President of India, the change in circumstance would entitle Kumar to file a fresh mercy plea.Present in court were Nirbhaya’s parents, who paid close attention to the proceedings. Advocates Seema Kushwaha and Jitender Kumar Jha, who represented them, argued that the convicts were trying to thwart justice by adopting delaying tactics. Jha also stated that according to a provision of the Delhi Prison Rules, 2018, the jurisdiction to decide such applications, filed by convicts, lay with the government and not with the court.Unimpressed with the contention, the court observed, “I cannot agree with the contention of the counsel for the victim that the jurisdiction to dispose of the application at hand vests with the government and not this court.” Neither did the provision, it went on to add, confer any power upon the executive authority to cause the order of the death sentence to be carried into effect nor did it give any judicial power to the authority to deal with such applications.The court also pointed out that the execution of sentence shall in all cases be postponed pending receipt of orders of the President. The court, as a result, had no “hesitation in observing” that the execution of warrant with respect to convict Vinay ought to be postponed. The court held, “As a cumulative effect of the discussion, I am of the opinion that the execution of warrants issued by this court by order dated January 17, 2020 deserves to be postponed till further order.”In Video: Nirbhaya case: Delhi court stays hanging of convicts till further orders",india,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73819150,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-525145,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/court-defers-nirbhaya-case-hangings-no-new-date-set/articleshow/73819041.cms

NEW DELHI/BEIJING: Around 366 Indians evacuated from Wuhan , the Chinese city at the heart of the deadly coronavirus outbreak, and expected to land in New Delhi on Saturday morning, will be placed in complete lockdown for 14 days at two quarantine facilities set up by the Army at Manesar and by ITBP at Chhawla in Delhi.Not even military personnel and doctors and other staff will be allowed to leave the facility unless “compelled by extreme urgency”, an Army officer said.Air India on Friday afternoon sent a double-decker Jumbo 747 to Wuhan from Delhi. After a delay, boarding finally began at Wuhan around 10.30pm (IST). AirIndia said another special plane might be sent on Saturday.Meanwhile, six suspected novel coronavirus cases have surfaced in capital and are being kept under observation in Ram Manohar Lohia (RML) hospital. Apart from Army and ITBP isolation facilities where the returnees from Wuhan in China will be kept under observation for at least 14 days, a 50-bed isolation unit has been set up at Safdarjung Hospital for critically ill patients.Once the Boeing 747 carrying students from Wuhan returns to Delhi, the passengers will undergo initial screening at the airport by a joint team of Armed Forces Medical Services (AFMS) and Airport Health Authority (APHO), and then taken directly to the quarantine centres. About 280 male students are to be taken to the Manesar camp and about 90 passengers, comprising families and women, will go to the Chhawla camp, the health ministry said.The plane, with 15 crew and five cockpit members, has 423 passenger seats. It’s carrying five doctors from RML Hospital and one paramedical staffer of Air India, along with medicines, masks, overcoats, packed food and other equipment. “A team of engineers and security personnel are also in the special aircraft. The rescue mission is led by Captain Amitabh Singh, director (operations) at Air India,” said Dhananjay Kumar, the airline’s spokesperson.At Wuhan, nearly 400 Indians had reached the airport ahead of their evacuation. They had received their boarding passes and were expecting to fly early morning on Saturday.The returnees went through a check-up at Wuhan. Reports reaching Beijing indicated that none of the travellers was stopped at the time of giving boarding passes. Most of them are students studying medicine and other subjects in five universities in Wuhan. They were among students who had chosen to stay back during the Spring festival holidays.At Delhi airport, the Army said the evacuees will be classified into three groups. The first group of “suspect cases” showing signs of fever, cough or respiratory distress, will be directly transferred to an isolation ward at the Army Base Hospital in Delhi Cantonment (BHDC).The second category will be of “close contact cases”, which will include individuals who have visited a seafood/animal market or a health facility or have encountered a Chinese person with symptoms in the last 14 days. They will be escorted in earmarked vehicles directly to the quarantine facility. The third group of “non-contact cases” will also be clubbed along with the “close contact” category and sent to the quarantine facility.The facility near Manesar consists of accommodation barracks for the students, administrative and medical facilities areas. “To prevent any mass outbreak, the facility has been divided into sectors, each with a maximum capacity of 50 students. Each sector has been further subdivided into barracks. The students in different sectors will not be allowed to intermingle,” said the officer.All returnees and visitors, in turn, will wear three-layered masks. After 14 days, persons with no symptoms will be allowed to go home with their detailed documentation being sent to their district/state surveillance units for further observation.“Those suspected of having been infected with coronavirus will be discharged after clinical recovery and two successive negative samples tested for n-COV. No civilian or serving personnel detailed to work at the facility will be allowed to go outside unless compelled by extreme emergency,” an Army officer said.Meanwhile, the six individuals admitted to RML Hospital with suspected coronavirus symptoms have all recently returned from China, including a 24-year-old woman who had been staying in China since 2015 and returned on January 29.The rest are all men, including a 19-year-old youth who was in China from November 2019 to January 24, and 34-year-old who returned on January 16 after a 10-year stay in that country.While five of the six self-reported to the hospital on Thursday, a 32-year-old man who had visited China from January 4 to January 11 was admitted on Friday. “The samples of all the six patients have been sent for testing and the reports are awaited,” an RML official said.In Video: Watch: First batch of Indian passengers board Air India special flight in Wuhan",india,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73819435,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-567526,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/ai-lifts-366-from-wuhan-to-be-isolated-in-delhi-ncr-camps/articleshow/73819320.cms

The company’s share price, which has been trending down since 2013 except for occasional spikes, rose by 5% in opening trade in the US following the announcement.Indian-origin CEOs now lead tech companies that together command a market capitalisation of nearly $2.7 trillion. These include Satya Nadella of Microsoft, Sundar Pichai of Alphabet/Google, Shantanu Narayen of Adobe, Sanjay Mehrotra of Micron Technology , Nikesh Arora of Palo Alto Networks, and George Kurian of NetApp.Krishna, 57, son of an Indian army officer, joined IBM in 1990, right after university, and is currently IBM’s senior vice president for cloud and cognitive software, two of the company’s biggest focus areas. He led the company's $34-billion acquisition of open source enterprise software company Red Hat in 2018, a deal that was the biggest in IBM’s history, and on which a lot of IBM’s future rides.""Arvind is the right CEO for the next era at IBM,"" said Rometty. ""He is a brilliant technologist who has played a significant role in developing our key technologies such as artificial intelligence, cloud, quantum computing and blockchain.”Many would be watching to see whether he can do for IBM what Nadella did for Microsoft. IBM’s annual revenue fell steadily for many years from 2011, when it had touched a high of $107 billion, and has risen only slightly in the past couple of years. It was weighed down by its legacy businesses, and could not transition to newer digital offerings with as much agility as younger companies like Amazon and Google. Nadella rejuvenated Microsoft with his focus on the cloud and partnerships with companies that were once regarded as competitors.In IBM’s case, analysts remain divided on whether it can pull itself up in a sustainable way. The company’s decision to repose faith in a man who has been a researcher and core to IBM’s new-age offerings in cloud and AI has raised hopes. Krishna hold 15 patents, and perhaps because of his research focus, has been relatively low profile.Rometty described Krishna as a superb operational leader, “able to win today while building the business of tomorrow.” Arvind, she said, has grown IBM's cloud and cognitive software business and led the largest acquisition in the company's history. “Through his multiple experiences running businesses in IBM, Arvind has built an outstanding track record of bold transformations and proven business results, and is an authentic, values-driven leader. He is well-positioned to lead IBM and its clients into the cloud and cognitive era,"" she said.Alex Gorsky, chairman of the Board's executive compensation and management resources committee said Krishna “thinks and executes squarely at the intersection of business and technology.""Going by the track record of Indian-origin CEOs, there’s a good chance that Krishna will deliver.

Women shout slogans during an anti-CAA protest in Mumbai on Friday (PTI)

NEW DELHI: Acknowledging the apprehensions of NDA allies regarding some new fields introduced in the National Population Register (NPR) questionnaire, the government has offered to tweak the NPR form to include a disclaimer that not replying to questions relating to date and place of birth of parents shall not impact the respondents’ citizenship status or put them in the ‘doubtful’ list.

Sources said at the NDA meeting on Friday, allies like JD(U), LJP and Akali Dal flagged the apprehension among certain sections about the new NPR form, leading home minister Amit Shah to state that while dropping columns from the form may not be feasible at this stage, a disclaimer that providing date and place of birth of parents will be optional could be inserted. “The government has already made it clear that it won’t be mandatory for respondents to share these details and that there is no need to produce any documents,” a source said.

The meeting also saw PM Narendra Modi striking a forceful note on CAA and saying that NDA members need not be defensive about it even as he assured Muslims that they should not worry about any infringement of rights which were safe. “The PM assured all that every citizen from minority communities, including Muslims, have as much rights as he has. He said the Constitution is supreme and there is no room for discrimination among citizens,” LJP patriarch Ram Vilas Paswan told TOI.

Other leaders also said the PM urged them to fully support the CAA and back it strongly in Parliament. Sources said Akali Dal, which had demanded that Muslims from Pakistan should also be brought under CAA’s purview, too said that it was strongly with the decision, even though the party has its own ideology.

The NPR exercise is scheduled between April and September. While Paswan had hinted at changes in the NPR form while talking to reporters in Patna on Tuesday, JD(U) chief Nitish Kumar suggested the question could be left out, considering there was confusion among people that leaving the relevant columns blank may create trouble for them in future.

The government, meanwhile, is also considering allowing the NPR form to be filled online by around 60 crore residents whose Aadhaar details are available in the NPR database from 2010 and 2015.

The NDA allies passed five resolutions hailing the PM for the Bodo accord and settlement of Bru migrants in Tripura. The other resolutions passed were on nullifying Articles 370 and 35A and opening of Kartarpur corridor for Sikh pilgrims. The allies also hailed the government’s decision to give ownership rights to people living in over 1,300 unauthorised colonies in Delhi, which is expected to benefit nearly 40 lakh people.

35,['1/02/2020'],"Farrukhabad: Man who took 25 kids hostage killed by cops, villagers stone wife to death","A murder convict held 25 children hostage for several hours

KATHARIYA VILLAGE (FARRUKHABAD): Subhash Batham, a murder convict who held a fake birthday party for his daughter in UP’s Farrukhabad and then held 25 children who were his “guests” hostage for several hours, was shot dead by police early on Friday morning. His wife, Ruby, who was allegedly an accomplice to the act, died in a hospital soon after after angry local residents pelted her with stones, lynching her. Police on Friday filed an FIR against 300 unknown people under Section 302 (murder).Police, forensic teams and the bomb disposal squad ( Moradabad ) claimed they had recovered 145 crude bombs, including a cylinder bomb and a can bomb, along with wire, battery, tape, sutali (thread) that they said were used in a bomb hurled by Batham during the night, injuring two constables.Twenty live cartridges, 11 used cartridges of a country made pistol and a .315 bore rifle were recovered from his house, police said, along with the used cartridge of an AK-47. Some of the children who had been held hostage had, however, told TOI that they saw only a katta and another country made rifle with Batham.Police said Batham — who never attended school — acquired his “bomb-making skills” during a 12-year stint in jail after he was convicted of murder. The basement in which he held the children hostage doubled up as his laboratory where he painstakingly readied the crude bombs, cops added, suggesting he had been planning his act for a long time.But as far as his motives are concerned, there are different theories — anger at the residents for boycotting him for a long time for marrying a Dalit woman, allegedly being left out of government schemes, and enmity against those who testified against him in court in the murder case.According to police, Batham had claimed on the night of the incident that the gram pradhan of Kathariya village and a local MLA had falsely implicated him in his uncle’s murder due to which he had ended up wasting his youth in prison. The gram pradhan, Harvir Singh, told TOI that he indeed testified in court against Batham and that’s why the man held enmity against him. “Batham murdered his uncle in 2001 after he had caught him stealing valuables from a neighbour’s house and scolded him. I was a witness in the case.”Commenting on a letter that Batham had written to authorities — demanding a house and toilet under government schemes — and which he handed to police on Thursday night, the gram pradhan said his demands were baseless. “He had written the letter for a house under the PM Awas Yojana and a toilet under the Swachh Bharat Mission years ago.” The real motive, he insisted, was revenge against him and village residents.Bhojpur MLA Nagendra Singh — who was also the target of Batham’s fury — said that he didn’t know the man but had visited the spot to defuse the situation. “He wanted revenge as he was boycotted by the community for marrying a Dalit woman four years ago,” he said.SP (Farrukhabad) Anil Kumar Mishra said, “The hostage situation could have been created to extort money as he demanded Rs 1 crore for each kid. He also wanted all criminal cases expunged against him.” Batham had five criminal cases going on against him in local courts.Whatever the motive, he was well-prepared, claimed police. “The quantity of bombs was good enough to kill everyone in a radius of 50 metres if they went off at once,” said Farrukhabad special operation group in charge Dinesh Kumar Gautam .Batham was shot even as the crowd of 300 pelted stones at their house. “As they were attacking the couple at the front door, we entered the house from the back. When he saw his wife being attacked, he grabbed his country made rifle after which he was shot dead,” said Mishra.Some residents, however, alleged that policemen “encouraged local residents to pelt stones at the couple”. On Friday, the couple’s bodies were sent for autopsy, while their two and a half year old daughter Kusum was handed over to child authorities.In Video: UP Police rescue all 23 kids kept hostage in Farrukhabad, suspect shot down",india,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73820290,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-476721,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/man-who-took-25-kids-hostage-killed-by-cops-villagers-stone-wife-to-death/articleshow/73820264.cms
36,['1/02/2020'],Parties should justify fielding tainted politicians: SC backs EC,"This story is from February 1, 2020

Supreme Court of India

NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Friday turned down Election Commission’s stand for taking action against candidates facing criminal charges and political parties for fielding them, but endorsed the poll watchdog’s suggestion that a party which chooses to field a candidate with criminal background should mandatorily spell out reasons justifying its choice.

A bench of Justices R F Nariman and S Ravindra Bhat said it is in agreement with the EC’s suggestion that political parties be directed to publish the credentials, achievements and criminal antecedents of candidates in newspapers, social media platforms and the party’s website along with the reason for preferring a candidate facing criminal cases.

“It shall be mandatory for all political parties to upload on their websites details of individuals with criminal antecedents, who have been selected as candidates, along with reasons why other individuals without criminal antecedents could not be selected. The reasons shall have to (provide) qualifications, achievements and merit of the candidate concerned and winnability shall not be sufficient justification,” the Commission said.

Though political parties might address this requirement by noting that the candidate faces politically coloured cases, the condition does force parties to place their reasons on record. Perhaps, the expectation seems to be that the embarrassment over having too many criminals on its slate might impel parties to be more discriminating in the selection of its candidates.

The court’s order also reflects limitations of efforts to keep “tainted” candidates off the ballot, given presumption of innocence until convicted. Also, the task of separating “minor” infractions like arrests during protests and dharnas and more serious criminal charges can present a different set of problems.

The bench also took into account opponents resorting to malicious litigation to get a candidate benched.“Cases with political overtones get filed and it is easy to get charges framed against a political opponent by slapping sedition charges and accusing them of being anti-national. We have to be careful as you may knock out a good candidate out of election. It would become an instrument of oppression. If charges are framed on the last date of nomination, the aggrieved candidate would be remedy-less. We have to be keenly aware about those situations,” the bench said.

The EC’s suggestion was filed in compliance of an apex court order asking its counsel and senior advocate Vikas Singh to sit with senior advocate Gopal Sankaranarayanan , appearing for petitioner and BJP leader Ashwini Upadhyay , and frame a joint proposal. The court said criminalisation of politics continues unabated and something had to be done in national interest to deal with the menace.

The Commission further said political parties must put all information in public domain about a candidate within 48 hours of nominating him and the party must also submit a report regarding publication within 24 hours. Emphasising the need to curb political parties from fielding tainted people, the Commission said there has been an alarming increase in the number of criminals in politics and told the bench that 24% of MPs had criminal background in 2004 but the number went up to 30% in 2009, 34 % in 2014 and the present Parliament as many as 43%MPs with grave criminal cases pending against them.

The bench disagreed with the suggestion that the poll panel be empowered to take action against the political party and a candidate under Article 324, including cancelling the nomination in case of non-compliance.

NEW DELHI: In what was seen as a reference to protests against the Citizenship Amendment Act, President Ram Nath Kovind on Friday said laws passed by Parliament should be accepted by citizens and that violence weakened society.The President’s remarks during his address to the joint sitting of Parliament came amid slogans, placards and banners marring the ceremonial function that marks the start of the budget session. The NDA and opposition benches clashed in a rare commotion during the usually staid address that is written by the government.“Our Constitution also places an expectation that the decisions taken through democratic processes will be accepted by the countrymen,” Kovind said. While the President stoutly defended CAA and the decision to scrap Jammu and Kashmir’s special status, there was no reference to the National Register of Citizens.Kovind said Mahatma Gandhi had held that Hindus and Sikhs of Pakistan who did not wish to live there after Partition could come to India. “It is the duty of the government of India to ensure a normal life for them,” he said quoting Gandhi and added, “I am happy that both the Houses of Parliament have fulfilled this wish by enacting the CAA.”The President said BJP icon Syama Prasad Mookerjee had protested the special status to J&K during the Nehru government. “Today, after seven decades, the whole country is happy that the dream of crores of freedom fighters including Mookerjee has come true,” he said.The remarks elicited thumping of desks by BJP members, the applause turning inordinately long, with even the President having to pause. It turned into a provocation for the opposition as cries of “shame, shame” rent Central Hall, followed by loud slogans — resulting in scenes not witnessed in contemporary history of the joint address which is usually an unremarkable affair.The protesters included Congress, DMK, IUML and other parties. Though the President resumed, the disruption recurred a few times later. At one point, Trinamool Congress MPs stood in their places and unfurled banners with slogans in blood red denouncing CAA-NPR-NRC while some like Congress’s Assam MP Abdul Khaleque demanded “CAA be out of Assam”. He also accused BJP ministers of spreading violence.As a mark of protest, Congress wore black bands to Central Hall and sat at the back, with even veterans Sonia Gandhi , Ghulam Nabi Azad and Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury giving up their front row seats. Only former PM Manmohan Singh sat in the front row. Some 14 opposition parties sat as a bloc. Two Congress managers went to Singh to inform about the plan but he chose to stay in his seat.Among those present in the front row were PM Narendra Modi, home minister Amit Shah and defence minister Rajnath Singh.Seeking to quell doubts over CAA, Kovind said, “My government would like to clarify once again that the procedures, which have existed for people from all faiths of the world who believe in India and who wish to obtain Indian citizenship, remain unchanged. A person of any faith can follow these processes and become a citizen of India.”He also assured that precautions had been taken to buffer the north-east from any cultural impact of CAA.As the President focused on CAA and Article 370, he condemned the “atrocities on minorities in Pakistan”, referring to a recent incident in Nankana Sahib to buttress the point. “I urge the world community to take cognizance of it and take necessary steps in this regard,” he said.The President also urged people to “buy local for a better tomorrow”. He urged people’s representatives from panchayat upwards to help in making “buy local” a success, which he said would help small entrepreneurs.In Video: Wish of Mahatma Gandhi has been fulfilled through enactment of CAA: President Ram Nath Kovind",india,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73820992,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-584030,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/amid-protests-president-ram-nath-kovind-says-accept-laws-passed-by-house/articleshow/73820991.cms

NEW DELHI: All 37 central ministers who visited Jammu and Kashmir as part of the government’s outreach will submit feedback to the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) on the implementation of various development initiatives in the Union Territory , officials said on Friday.

So far, 14 ministers have submitted their assessment on implementation of the welfare schemes to the home ministry, which will be forwarded to the Prime Minister’s Office for follow-up action. The remaining ministers are expected to turn in their feedback soon, a home ministry functionary said. While the ministers had sent in their detailed reports earlier, PMO officials are said to have sought information to be recorded in a standard proforma, giving out precise details regarding penetration and impact of development and entitlement schemes.

The ministers had visited J&K earlier this month following a directive from PM Modi, who wanted an honest assessment of various welfare schemes being carried out in the newly-created UT.

Among those who visited J&K included law minister Ravi Shankar Prasad , sports minister Kiren Rijiju , ministers of state for home G Kishan Reddy and Nityanand Rai , among others. The ministers only spoke about development initiatives and there was no reference to political issues, an official said.

While interacting with local people, the ministers got first hand information about local roads, healthcare facilities, availability of LPG cylinders, power situation, functioning of academic institutions besides other issues.

There will be two sets of feedback — one on the initiatives taken by the UT administration and the other about the central government initiatives, the official said.

Most central ministers stayed overnight at the respective places that they visited in J&K like Baramulla, Ganderbal and Doda.

NEW DELHI: Make-in-India has got a makeover. The Economic Survey has advocated that the government make an aggressive ‘Assemble-in-India’ pitch, without jettisoning the Make-in-India anthem, to create four crore jobs in five years. The idea is to take advantage of the trade war and adjustments due to rising labour costs in China.The strategy, which has already yielded results in assembly of cars as well as mobile phones, is seen as the panacea for employment generation, especially in the manufacturing sector, at a time when job creation has become a major concern.The other focus seems to be on entrepreneurship, with government’s annual economic report card indicating that there is a massive activity at the ground level, seen in the establishment of 1.2 lakh firms in 2018, an over 70% rise over the 70,000 new entities set up in 2014.But India becoming home to global giants such as Apple, Samsung and Sony, much like China, is seen to be the main driver in addition to the focus on traditional sectors such as textiles and footwear.The underlying theme is availability of labour and the massive potential for exports, given the low share of network products such as telecom equipment, office machines, electrical machinery and road products. To to do this, India has to be part of a global value chain as developing countries find it tough to create a market for capital-intensive products in quality and brand-conscious richer countries. It will also require government to allow import of components at low tariffs.As an example, China received less than $8.5 for assembling every iPhone 7 , but the value added was very high given the large volumes, which make it a global assembly hub.Going by current projections, India’s export of network products is projected to rise from $32 billion in 2018 to $248 billion in 2025 and top $490 billion in 2030. As a result, direct employment is projected to increase from 4 4 lakh jobs in 2020 to 1.4 crore jobs in 2025 and over 2.5 crore in 2030. If the overall impact is included, the impact on jobs will be much higher, the Survey said.",business,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73821555,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-732267,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/from-make-in-india-to-assemble-in-india/articleshow/73821300.cms

MUMBAI: Middle-class investors will pay tax on dividend income from shares and mutual funds at lower rates, said finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Friday, adding that they will have more money in their hands to spend following the proposals announced in the Budget.

Sitharaman had proposed dividend income to be taxable in the hands of investors at their income tax slab rates and abolished the payment of dividend distribution tax, or DDT, by companies and mutual funds.

In the current system, after the deduction of DDT by companies and mutual funds, dividend becomes tax-free in the hands of investors. However, in the new system, the tax burden on investors in the higher income tax rate bracket increases, while it comes down for people in the lower slab.

The finance minister said changes proposed in the personal income tax also puts more money in the hands of the middle class and they are “capable of deciding where to put that without being directed by anyone”.

“Eventually, we want to have an income tax framework with low tax rates and easy compliance.” Sitharaman added that the government wants to decriminalise laws. “We started with Companies Act and now we are looking at the Income Tax Act. We want to ensure that civil offences are not treated as criminal offences,” she told newspersons in Mumbai.

Before addressing the media, the finance minister, along with her team, held a session with economists, financial services players and professionals for their feedback on the Budget proposals. The government has also proposed to list LIC on the stock exchanges which would “bring retail investors into the picture”.

“The IPO of LIC will make issues more transparent,” Sitharaman said. An IPO unlocks value in a company, offers the outfit access to capital markets and makes it disciplined. The LIC stock market launch, when it happens, will be India’s largest IPO.

The Budget has also increased insurance cover on bank deposits five-fold to Rs 5 lakh. Deposit insurance, provided by the Deposit Insurance and Credit Guarantee Corporation, an arm of the RBI, had been static at Rs 1 lakh since 1993. The government is working on the Financial Resolution Deposit Insurance (FRDI) Bill, but not sure when it will be tabled in the House, said Sitharaman before heading to Chennai for an interaction with industry captains.

The principals of the three schools were asked to furnish names of two teachers from their institutions by January 23 for training on the ongoing ‘NCR’ exercise.

The letter made a mention of personal details of the teachers being required for the ‘NRC’ and the principals were rebuked by the Mokama BDO Satish Kumar for “apparently being opposed to NRC at the instance of some particular political party”.

Sharing screenshot of the letter on his twitter handle, the leader of opposition in the state assembly Tejashwi wrote, “While lie of Nitish Kumar caught. Now you all have to decide who the real Sanghi is (sic)”.

Kushwaha tweeted, “@Nitish Kumar ji, you left even the BJP behind. PM@narendramodi says NRC has not been discussed and you got orders passed. And you have the temerity to accuse school principals of collusion with a political party (sic)?”

Defending the government, IPRD minister Neeraj Kumar said, “The opposition leaders would have done better by sharing the corrigendum issued by the Mokama BDO the very next day, whereby the earlier letter had been cancelled”.

“That the chief minister feels there is no need for NRC in the state needs no reiteration. Further, in the light of the averments by the Prime Minister, it is obvious that the reality of this issue is not lost on the opposition leaders, though if they want to enjoy themselves, it is their choice,” the minister said.

When contacted, BDO Satish Kumar said, “It was a human error, which was rectified the very next day. The correct letter was dispatched and also sent on WhatsApp of the principals concerned.” The BDO said that a show-cause notice was served to office clerk Santosh Kumar for the mistake.

PATNA: Amid recovery of dead crows from several areas in the city over the past few days, Patna zoo director Amit Kumar on Friday ruled out outbreak of bird flu in the zoo as well as in the city. “Disinfectants are used in the zoo throughout the year for safety of birds. It is a routine process,” he added.

Kumar’s statement came a day after reports in a section of media that the zoo staff have been warned about bird flu and asked to wear mask. “According to the guidelines issued by Central Zoo Authority, Union ministry of agriculture and farmer’s welfare and animal husbandry department for prevention of bird flu, samples from the zoo are sent to regional disease diagnostic laboratory in Kolkata every month,” Kumar said in a press release.

It may be recalled that the zoo was closed for 49 days from December 25 in 2018 following the death of six peafowls due to bird flu.

Acclaimed Kannada writer SL Bhyrappa was on Friday conferred the Ambikatanayadutta Award at Bendre Bhavan in D... Read More

Dharwad: A veritable colossus in the world of Indian letters, SL Bhyrappa , who has kept his pen firmly on the page for more than 50 years in the course of which he has authored more than 25 novels hinted that his long innings as an active writer was nearing its end.

Bhyrappa, in Dharwad to receive the prestigious Ambikatanayadatta Award instituted by the Dr Da Raa Bendre National Memorial Trust at the Bendre Bhavan in Sadhanakeri, cited his advanced years as being one of the reasons for contemplating a farewell to writing. Uttara Kaanda , which was a re-telling of the Hindu epic Ramayana published in 2017 was Bhyrappa’s last novel .

Admitting that he had been seized by an impulse to drop his pen for good earlier as well, Bhyrappa added, “But I was often gripped by another idea, another theme and I would set to work on those. This has not come to pass this time around since I have no theme to work on. Considering my age, I do not think Kannada literature can expect another novel from me.”

Sharing his thoughts on the rather contentious issue of introducing the mother tongue as a medium of instruction in schools, Bhyrappa said, “I have discussed this subject with Prime Minister Narendra Modi and impressed on him the need for the native language of the state serving as the medium of instruction till class IV. I suggested that the Supreme Court’s order on this issue needs to be overturned by means of a legislation.”

Bhyrappa said that the PM had concurred with his views on the subject. “However, he expressed helplessness pointing to the habit of the opposition parties to question each bill tabled in the Parliament. He told me that his party colleagues also spoke after the manner of the opposition parties,” Bhyrappa added.

‘Brahmins unjustly blamed for caste system’

In his illustrious career, Bhyrappa refused to identify himself with any particular literary movement , and on Friday, he underscored the perils of an artist’s association with a set of ideas. “Literary movements tie down writers to a particular ideology. A writer associated with such a movement will have to produce works that conform with its ideology,” he said. Training guns at the cliquish power structures at play in the world of letters, Bhyrappa said, “One will find that works adhering to an ideology will be reviewed favourably by critics who are also acolytes of the same. Similarly, when a writer deviates from this ideology, he or she is reproached. I believe that a writer must steer clear of any such movement.”

The doyen of Kannada literature opined that Brahmins had been unjustly been made to wear the yoke of being the perpetrators of the caste system. “In India, caste was tied to professional benefits. It was mutually beneficial for the daughter of a weaver to marry a man in the same profession. Today, you will find doctors choosing spouses in the medical profession,” Bhyrappa added.

The Ambikanayadutta Award bestowed on Bhyrappa carries a citation, memento and a cash reward of Rs 1 lakh. Despite the state government slashing funds to the trust, the members decided against reducing the purse for the award.

GM Hegde, Harsh Dambal, Sangamnath Lokapur, Shashidhar Narendra, Malati Pattanshetti and Venkatesh Machakanur were among those who participated the event. Chairman of Bendre Trust DM Hiremath proposed the vote of thanks at the event.

Transactions and clearing of cheques worth over 1,400 crore will not take place for next three days

Surat: Banking operations in the Diamond City were severely hit with public sector banks remaining shut as a part of nationwide strike for two days called by United Forum of Bank Unions from Friday.

Over 6,000 bank employees of 17 public sector banks, including State Bank of India (SBI), joined the strike under the banner of Gujarat Bank Workers’ Union (GBWU). About 350 branches of PSU banks across the city were closed.

It is estimated financial transactions and clearing of cheques to the tune of over Rs1,400 crore will not take place for next three days as Sunday happens to be a holiday.

The striking bank employees gathered outside Bank of Baroda (BOB) headquarters on Ghod Dod Road and participated in a demonstration. The bank employees shouted slogans against bank management for not accepting their long-pending demands including 20% pay hike, five-day work a week, merger of special allowance with basic pay, scrapping of new pension scheme etc.

Vasant Barot, organizational secretary of GBWU, said, “The strike was successful on the first day with about 350 branches of 17 public sector banks remaining closed. This will continue on Saturday as well. The banks will reopen only on Monday. Our demands for pay hike and five-day work a week are genuine, but the bank managements are not in our favour.”

Meanwhile, trading community in the city including textile and diamond traders were critical of the bank strike. Champalal Bothra, secretary of Federation of Surat Textile Traders’ Association (FOSTTA), said, “It is month-end and time for giving wages and salaries to employees. The strike has been called at a wrong time. The business in textile market has been severely affected as clearance of cheques will not take place for two days.”

Surat: Authorities at the Sachin GIDC are in a fix for spending lakhs of rupees for purchasing plants as as part of the industrial estate beautification project.

Several members have raised questions over Rs 42 lakh spent for purchase of 4,000 plants, when the plants were available free-of-cost from the forest department and the Surat Municipal Corporation (SMC).

Former secretary of the Sachin GIDC Cooperative Society, Mayur Golwala has demanded an inquiry alleging a scam and has written letter to the top authorities of the Gujarat Industrial Development Corporation (GIDC). Also, he has demanded that the new proposal for purchasing plants worth Rs 50 lakh be cancelled.

Sources said the decision to plant 4,000 trees in the estate was taken by the Sachin Notified Area Authority in its 38th board of management meeting in October 2018. The notified area had invited quotations from various nurseries in and around Surat for supplying the saplings. The lowest bidder who had quoted Rs 42 lakh for 4,000 trees was given the contract to plant trees in the open spaces of the GIDC estate till June 2019.

“For every single plant, the authorities have spent Rs 1,000. The authorities have not followed the tendering process. The price itself has raised questions against the GIDC authorities when the tree saplings are distributed free of cost by the SMC, forest department and other NGOs,” said Golwala.

Golwala added, “I have demanded an inquiry into the issue. Recently, the board of notified authority has passed a resolution to purchase plants worth Rs 50 lakh two months ago. I have demanded that the proposal be cancelled in the wider interest of the members of GIDC.”

Chairman of Sachin GIDC Notified Area Authority, Mahendra Ramoliya said, “We have purchased the plants as per the guidelines of the GPCB and the National Green Tribunal (NGT). Our purpose is to make the entire GIDC estate green in the next couple of years. The allegations levelled against us are totally baseless and we are ready to face any inquiry.”

Rajkot: A man was arrested on Friday for allegedly stabbing his cousin to death and injuring another cousin over an old dispute in Rajula of Amreli district on Thursday evening.

Police said the accused, identified Wasim Varaiya (26), had stabbed his cousins — Irfan Varaiya (23) and his brother Imran Varaiya (22) — in Ghanchiwad locality of Rajula.

While Imran was seriously injured, Irfan succumbed to his injuries at Rajula Civil Hospital.

Yunus Varaiya, father of Irfan and Imran, said in his complaint that Wasim and Irfan had been at loggerheads over a trivial issue and had been picking up fights with each other for the past four months. The issue was as trivial as ‘why you are giving me a stare?’

On the day of the crime, when Irfan and Imran came for lunch, Wasim called them out their house and stabbed Irfan. When Imran intervened, he, too, was stabbed.

Both the brothers were rushed to Rajula Civil Hospital, where Irfan died shortly after admission, while Imran was referred to Mahuva Civil Hospital as his condition became critical.

Wasim was arrested from his home on Friday.

Khargone: Forty armed robbers entered an under-construction plant of National Thermal Power Corporation (NTPC) in Selda Dalchi town of Khargone on Friday to steal construction material, prompting security personnel posted there to open fire. One person was reportedly killed after suffering the gunshots.

Khargone ASP Shashikant Kankane told TOI that 40 armed people entered NTPC plant early on Friday to steal scrap and cables. “As security guards tried to stop them, the armed people started pelting stones at them. This forced the guards to fire in retaliation. At the same time police patrol van passed by. On hearing its siren, the robbers fled from the spot. In the attack, one SAF jawan Jayant was also injured”, said Kankane.

After the incident, a man reached Khamkheda police post with the body of his brother - Ramesh Masania, 37 and told police that some villagers took him on Thursday night to be a part of their robbery bid. He said they left his body in front of his house in Umarbad. Kanakane said that the deceased was among those who tried to rob NTPC plant and there were bullet shots on his body.

Police teams of Sanawad, Kasrawad and Bedia have been deployed at the spot. SP Sunil Kumar Pandey said that the body was sent for postmortem examination and investigation has been started.

Bank employees demonstrate near Gandhi Maidan

PATNA: Banking operations were hit in the city and elsewhere in the state on Friday due to a two-day nationwide strike call given by the United Forum of Bank Unions (UFBU).

The UFBU, which comprises bank unions like All India Bank Employees’ Association (AIBEA) and Bank Employees’ Federation of India, saw active participation of thousands of bank employees. Several demonstrations were held at different locations in the city, including New Dak Bungalow Road.

The strike, which was limited to government and state-owned banks, also witnessed participation of private banks, many of which were shut for transactions and other operations. Ruby Verma, the manager of a private bank in Kankarbagh, told this newspaper, “Deposits, withdrawals, cheque clearance and other services at all branches were affected due to the strike. However, ATM services and online transactions were not affected.”

Meanwhile, many people visited ATMs on Friday as cash will not be refilled during the strike. “Banks will be shut on Sunday and refilling of cash will not take place. That will be a huge problem,” said Suman Yadav, a resident of Bans Ghat.

AIBEA general secretary J P Dixit said, “In a meeting held on Thursday, the UFBU had demanded a 20% hike in employees’ wages, including performance-linked incentive. The Indian Banks’ Association, however, agreed for an increase of 13% and the bank unions refused it. The issue is pending since 2017 and we have not yet found a solution.”

He added, “Some of our other demands include scrapping of new pension scheme, uniform working hours in every city and five-day workweek. Besides, the agenda of transforming mass banking to class banking is unacceptable as it will hit the people living in rural areas. The bank unions are totally against it.”

Raghuvansh Prasad Singh

PATNA: Two founding members of RJD – state president Jagdanand Singh and national vice-president Raghuvansh Prasad Singh – held an hour-long meeting at the party’s state headquarters in a damage control bid on Friday.

Sources said the two Rajput stalwarts of the party, who had been at loggerheads with each other, met following party president Lalu Prasad ’s intervention who told them to bury the hatchet and prepare for the upcoming assembly polls in the state.

Incidentally, Raghuvansh is scheduled to meet Lalu at Rajendra Institute of Medical Sciences (RIMS) in Ranchi on Saturday.

“The two senior party functionaries were asked by Lalu to sit together and prepare a blueprint for the upcoming assembly election. Raghuvansh will share the outcome of the meeting with Lalu on Saturday,” said a senior party leader.

Raghuvansh had recently raised objections over Jagdanand’s style of functioning and compared him with ‘Hitler’.

Raghuvansh had also written to Lalu on January 9 and marked a copy to Jagdanand, lamenting party’s “lethargic” approach towards formation of committees at the grassroots level ahead of the assembly election.

After Friday’s meeting, Raghuvansh said there was no tussle between him and Jagdanand. “We are committed to strengthening the party. Jagdanand has agreed to all the 11 proposals recommended by me at the meeting, including formation of committees at the grassroots level. We will also work at the booth level and focus on the grievances of the poor, farmers, elderly people and students,” Raghuvansh added.

Jagdanand also said he had no difference with Raghuvansh. “All of us are united and follow the same path. We all believe in socialist ideology. As far as Raghuvansh’s visit to the party office is considered, there is hierarchy in all the organisations. Being the vice-president of the party, he can come to the office and monitor the work being done. We will abide by his instructions,” Jagdanand said.

However, though both leaders refuted rumours of differences between them, they addressed the media separately from the same office.

PATNA: The city police plans to move court to seek an arrest warrant against retired DSP Uttim Singh , 63, for allegedly killing a 45-year-old Meena Devi with whom he had a relationship.

Singh had dumped the body in Gandak river in near Hajipur on December 5 last year. The body was never traced.

Patrakar Nagar police station SHO Pramod Kumar said the slain woman’s son, Piyush Raj (23), had lodged a missing complaint on December 5 last. “He later pointed at the retired DSP as a possible suspect and told the police that his mother had a relationship with him,” Kumar said, adding, she was killed on the same day by the ex-DSP, after he had called her to Hajipur.

“Singh is absconding so police would move court for an arrest warrant against him,” the SHO said, adding, the retired officer’s close friend Ramakant Singh and his wife Girija Devi were taken into custody on Thursday for aiding in the crime.

“Uttim had an illicit relationship with Meena. She was pressuring him to marry her. In addition, it has also emerged that the woman had also demanded a share of his property after which he decided to kill her,” the SHO said.

“Ramakant and his wife Girija were picked up from their residence at Choti Pahadi under Agamkuan police station area on January 29. During interrogation, the duo confessed that Uttim strangulated Meena and they had helped him commit the crime. Later, Uttim carried Meena’s body in his car and threw it into the river,” Kumar said.

The retired officer is a resident of Hajipur town in Vaishali district while Meena lived in a rented accommodation at Jogipur under Patrakar Nagar police station area in the state capital. The retired officer had served as SHO of Agamkuan, Gandhi Maidan and a few other police stations in Patna . He had retired barely a month after being promoted as DSP.

MANGALURU: Animal rescuer Rajni Damodar Shetty, 40, rescued a stray dog that had fallen into a 30-foot deep well near Ballalbagh on Thursday.Rajni told TOI that children found that a dog had fallen into a well. They immediately alerted locals and many people rushed to save the dog by using tyres.“The moment I received a call, I rushed to the spot. The dog may have landed in the well in the morning and it was already 2pm when I got there. The animal was scared. I was a bit nervous, but at the same time, I knew that I cannot allow the dog to die. I did not want to take a chance. Locals told me that I should get into the well only if I was confident, and should not risk my life,” she said.Further, Rajni explained that it is an unused well with at least 10 feet of water in it.“With the help of a rope tied to my waist, I got into the well. The dog had managed to sit in a corner of the well, and was initially scared; it even tried to bite me. The moment I petted it; it became friendly.

Thiruvananthapuram: The CPM and Congress on Saturday termed the Union budget as anti-public and anti-state while being pro-corporate. CPM state secretary Kodiyeri Balakrishnan said the budget ignored the state completely and it is a gross injustice that the Centre slashed its share to the state by Rs 5,000 crore, compared to last year.

The state’s share for all social welfare programmes, including the employment guarantee scheme, have been slashed. He said that the compensation for GST, increasing of the borrowing limits of the state etc have also been ignored in the budget. Also, the Centre has ignored the speedy implementation of national highway development and proposed rail corridor project in the budget.

Opposition leader Ramesh Chennithala said the budget is completely disappointing and the state has been totally ignored against which strong protest should come up. He said the country is facing the biggest unemployment rates in the last 45 years and there are no concrete steps to contain this problem in the budget.

The budget has embraced the corporates by ignoring the general public, said KPCC president Mullappally Ramachandran in a statement. Mullappally said the term most used in the budget was PPP, indicating privatization. Even the tax sops have stringent provisions attached, he said, adding that issues like joblessness and problems faced by the agricultural, industrial and service sectors have been completely ignored.

LDF convenor A Vijayaraghavan said that the Centre has continued the same policy of neglect towards the state which it had earlier shown in providing flood relief assistance.

57,['1/02/2020'],Neglect puts Hope Bridge’s replacement in peril,"This story is from February 1, 2020

The neglect of the bridge has killed the craze for it among people

Surat: Residents of the walled city and Adajan still reminisce about the evenings that they spent on the benches on Hope Bridge built in 1877 across Tapi River. They had lots of hope from the bridge that replaced this heritage structure in 2015, but it has simply failed them. In a bid to keep old memories alive, Surat Municipal Corporation (SMC) had constructed a heritage walkway resembling the old one on the new structure at a cost of Rs53 crore. The cast-iron benches on the new bridge remained damaged for long time, but now they have been stolen by thieves. The lighting on the bridge is not working at many places and decorative balloon lights either have been damaged or stolen. About 14 paintings depicting the historical importance of the erstwhile port city have also gone missing.

For about 88 years, Hope Bridge was the only link between two parts of the city-Chowk Bazaar and Rander. In 1999, the bridge was banned for vehicles and later for pedestrians as well after a feasibility study found it to be unsafe.

The heritage walkway beckoned people in hordes when it was thrown open for people on April 3, 2015 . The numbers swelled at dusk when residents would gather on the walkway to spend quality time with their friends and family amid the cool breeze coming from the river. However, the neglect of the bridge has killed the craze for it among people.

Akshay Pandya, executive engineer (bridge cell), told TOI, “We had tried to replicate Hope Bridge and were successful too. But, some elements stole cast-iron benches, damaged paintings, flower pots and decorative balloon lightings, thus throwing a spanner in the works. We have moved a proposal for installing conventional benches, which are unbreakable. People would be able to sit and enjoy their evenings again.”

The building is about 25 years old

Surat: A major accident was averted in a residential apartment at posh Athwalines area when the ceiling of balcony of a house on ninth floor collapsed here on Friday evening. There were no casualties.

Sources in fire and emergency services department of Surat Municipal Corporation (SMC) said the incident occurred at about 5:30pm at Sargam apartment. A portion of the concrete slab of the balcony of a pent house suddenly collapsed and got stuck in the balcony of the house below the pent house.

Fire officer Nilesh Dave told TOI, “The ceiling of the balcony of the pent house came crashing down. Some debris fell on the ground, while the remaining got stuck in the balcony of the house located below the pent house. No one was injured. A team was called from Athwa zone for safely removing the concrete debris. Residents of houses on other floors located below the pent house were asked to evacuate.”

Hiren Shah, a textile businessman and owner of the pent house, said, “We heard a loud noise in the balcony. The ceiling had collapsed. Just a few minutes ago, we had shut the balcony door. The building is about 25 years old and we never thought that such an incident would happen. Now, it is risky to live in this house as anything can happen. We will follow the directions of the civic body with regard to structural stability of the apartment.”

There was traffic jam on the road as commuters and pedestrians had stopped to see the collapsed ceiling. A police team from Umara police station cleared the road for traffic.

59,['1/02/2020'],PSU Banks Inefficient On Every Parameter,"This story is from February 1, 2020

Mumbai: In a strong critique of the performance of public sector banks (PSBs), the Economic Survey said while Rs 4.3 lakh crore of taxpayers ’ money has gone into PSBs , every rupee invested has lost 23 paise as on 2019. The survey also described Indian banks as suffering ‘dwarfism’, with only one bank in the top 100, while six are needed for an economy like India’s size.

PSBs should be asked to share corporate data among themselves through a GSTN-like entity ( PSB network) and undertake analytics of the data using fintech. PSB employees should hold stake through Employee Stock Option Scheme across all levels. “Part-ownership of PSBs by employees will reduce agency problems. This is because employees who own shares are incentivised to increase market value of equity.”

Assessing the performance of government banks after completion of 50 years of nationalisation in July 2019, the government’s report card on economy said on every performance parameter ‘PSBs are inefficient compared to their peer groups’.

As of January 2020, every rupee of a taxpayer’s money invested in PSB is fetching a market value of Rs 71 paise. As against that every rupee invested in a private bank fetches a market value of Rs 3.7, which is five times of the return in PSBs.

According to the report, if the market-to-book ratio of each PSB becomes equal to that of the second-worst new private bank, the improvement would gain the government Rs 9.1 lakh crore, which is about 8.5 times the disinvestment budget for 2019.

Highlighting the importance of banks, the survey said historically the top-five economies have always been supported by their banks. “India becoming a $5-trillion economy will require at least eight Indian banks to be large enough to belong in the top 100 globally.” However, credit growth in PSBs has been sluggish, largely because of their large stock of bad loans. In 2019, PSBs reported gross non-performing assets (NPAs) of Rs 7.4 lakh crore, which is 11.9% of their loans. “NPAs of Indian banks, particularly PSBs, could have been prevented if data and analytics were employed in corporate lending.”

While there have been arguments of the social impact of bank nationalisation, the survey said there have been multiple factors at work. Noting that rural branches have increased 10-fold and credit to rural areas rose 20-fold in the first decade after nationalisation, it said some caution is necessary in interpreting the above trends as being entirely caused by nationalisation.

“A key confounder in such an interpretation is the role played by other interventions around bank nationalisation. For instance, the government initiated a green revolution and anti-poverty programmes.” To further confound matters, the RBI had introduced directed lending programmes, which set priority sector targets for banks and the RBI used both formal means and moral suasion to persuade lenders to achieve its targets.

Explaining reasons for disproportionate share of bad loans among PSBs, the report card said a plausible explanation could be that in Indian economy’s growth phase between 2004 and 2011, PSU banks grew their loan portfolio but this credit growth was of suspect quality.

On outlook for banks, the survey highlighted the country’s demographics and the Jan Dhan-Aadhaar-Mobile combine as the two big driving forces.

As against the earlier reports that made a push for dilution of government stake, the survey made a strong pitch for employee ownership of PSBs. Even as the Indian Banks Association is negotiating a wage settlement with unions, it said the current flat compensation contracts and pressures from ex-post monitoring by the vigilance agencies, it is hardly surprising that the staff prefer safety and conservatism over risk-taking. So, there should be transfer of a portion of government stake to employees exhibiting good performance across all levels of the organisation through ESOPs. The report card pushed for lateral recruitment, stating that professionals with domain skills in technology, data science, finance and economics are required, given challenge from fintechs.

Surat: A dental surgeon has registered a case of dowry harassment in Puna police station against her husband, who works in the Indian Airforce , as well as her in-laws. She has alleged them of torturing her physically and mentally for bringing Rs20 lakh as dowry and have been putting pressure on her demanding Rs 51 lakh more.

According to the case details, the woman had married Abhisheksingh Vinodsingh Tanvar, wing commander in Indian Air-force based at Coimbatore in TN in 2017. He is a resident of Shahibaug in Ahmedabad. The dental surgeon runs a clinic in Khatodara area of Surat.

She alleged that her father-in-law Vinodsingh Rajput and mother-in-law Shashi who lived in Ahmedabad along with their elder son, Ankush Singh and his wife Shiba kept torturing her for more money. According to her complaint, all her in-laws constantly harassed her for Rs 51 lakh more.

The woman said that she had already given her husband Rs 20 lakh to buy a new car, but the in-laws made her life miserable with their constant demands. Not being able to withstand the torture any more, she approached the police.

An investigating officer of police said, “We have registered the complaint under IPC 498(A), 114 and anti-dowry Act sections 3 and 4 . We are in process of gathering evidences. The accused in-laws have also made some counter allegations. The families originally hail from Rajasthan,” the cop said.

Police further said that after all evidences are gathered and statements of the people are recorded to corroborate with the evidences, cops will act on the case. “Meanwhile, our investigations are going on,” the officer said.

A source in the police said that often the root cause of the case, particularly in educated families, turn out to be different than what the complaints project. “We can't act unless we have some concrete evidences of torture,” the officer added.

Surat: Meena Mehta , 62 , also known as ‘pad wali dadi’ (granny who gives pad) used to distribute kits containing sanitary pads and undergarments to poor adolescent girls studying in the primary schools run by the Surat Municipal Corporation (SMC) to help them maintaining menstrual hygiene.

However, she has stopped supplying pads to the girls, after the Nagar Prathamik Shikshan Samiti (NPSS) of the SMC recently asked her not to take videos of the girls during distribution. The NPSS also further ordered that the kits be distributed to girls only by the teachers.

President of NPSS, Hasmukh Patel said, “She (Meena) was taking videos of schoolgirls wherein she would ask about the colour of the underwear she was distributing. We found it objectionable and decided that the kits would be distributed by the teachers and did not allowed her to take any videos and photographs.”

Mehta, who has been distributing the kits monthly since 2013, had got inspiration after reading about the chairperson of Infosys Foundation and a social worker, Sudha Murthy, who had donated four trucks of sanitary napkins as relief supplies in Chennai after the 2004 tsunami.

Her organisation, Manuni Foundation, in last seven years has distributed kits to over 5,000 girls in 35 municipal schools.

Talking with TOI, Mehta said, “We were taking photographs and videos of the girls for our record. There was nothing objectionable. Still, the school authorities wanted us to give the kits to the headmaster and banned us from taking any video or photograph in the school.”

“After the direction of NPSS we decided to discontinue the work in the municipal schools,” she added.

62,['1/02/2020'],NBFC health check to limit borrowing,"This story is from February 1, 2020

Mumbai: The Economic Survey has suggested that policymakers should use a dynamic health index, which captures liquidity risks in non-banking finance companies (NBFCs), to avoid financial fragility in the sector. It added that the score could be used by the regulator for limiting the amount NBFCs could borrow from other institutions to reduce systemic risks.

The health tracker index would factor in re-financing risk, which would be determined by the extent of reliance on short-term financing and balance sheet strength of the NBFCs.

At a most fundamental level, the root cause of crisis in the NBFC sector could be traced to over-dependence of NBFCs on short-term wholesale funding market. A health score would have identified the fragility in the sector even during their high-growth phase. “Overall it was found that the health score for the housing finance sector exhibited a declining trend post-2014.”

After growing very fast in 2017-18 and the first half of 2018-19, the NBFC sector decelerated sharply since then. The growth of loans from NBFCs declined from 27.6% in September 2018 and 21.6% in December 2018 to 9.9% at September-end 2019.

The balance sheet of the NBFC sector grew by 17.9% from Rs 26.2 lakh crore to Rs 30.9 lakh crore during 2018-19. This growth was on top of a growth of 21.3% recorded during 2017-18 despite concerns over NBFCs. The third quarter of 2018-19 witnessed liquidity stress. The cost of funds for NBFCs declined by March 2019 and further by September 2019, as reflected in the three-month CP discount rate.

Rajkot: The body of a woman was found on the outskirts of Datarana village of Menderada taluka in Junagadh district on Thursday evening.

The family members of the victim, identified as 21-year-old Anju Mal, suspect one Nilesh Vaghasia of being involved in the crime. Police have launched a manhunt for Nilesh who has absconded ever since the body was found.

The police have also sent the body for forensic postmortem to GG Hospital in Jamnagar to ascertain whether it was sexually assaulted before the murder was committed.

Mal used to work as a farm labourer in the farm owned by Babu Vaghasia. “Nilesh was the owner of an adjoining farm. We suspect that he tried to rape the victim, but when she resisted the attempt, he strangled her,” said A B Desai, sub-inspector with Menderada police station.

The victim and her husband Kalpesh Mal had come from Balaiya village of Fatehpura taluka in Dahod district to work as farm labourers.

“We suspect Nilesh of having committed necrophilia as the victim was found half-naked. However, whether any sexual crime was committed or not, would be ascertained once the postmortem report is released. Our investigation has found that it was Nilesh who had called Mal to his farm,” added Desai.

PANAJI: Stakeholders have called for a coordinated effort to tackle the substance abuse problem in the state. Founder of Human Touch, Peter Borges, highlighted the need for a state drug policy and for looking at substance abuse in an integrated manner.

“We have not looked at substance abuse in an integrated manner. There is no agency which drives demand reduction programs in Goa apart from a few NGOs. The state needs to financially provide for demand reduction. We need to make a financial budget to address the problem of substance abuse,” he said, adding that the focus in the state is largely restricted to seizures of narcotics and role of police.

He was speaking at the Goa state consultation on drug abuse organised by the Goa Institute of Management, Sakhali.

Dean of Goa Medical College Dr Shivanand Bandekar advised students of healthcare management at the institute not to give in to peer pressure and not to take it for granted that their willpower would get them out of addiction. “Most addicts are introduced to substances by close friends and not unknown peddlers,” Bandekar said.

Sharing tragic stories of youth addicted to alcohol and narcotics, Bandekar busted some myths, like alcohol assures sound sleep, that there’s no harm in trying it out just once, and that it takes away one’s problems.

Founder of Kripa Foundation, Joe Pereira, stressed on the need to look at it as a human problem and not only focus on demand reduction. He urged students to help create a community of winners (former addicts), who could act as role models to get the message across to others.

KOLKATA: India’s first and only confirmed patient of the novel coronavirus (nCoV) — a student from Thrissur in Kerala — had travelled through Kolkata airport on January 23, four days before she showed signs of flu. She tested positive for the virus on Thursday. On Friday, Kolkata airport officials said the woman had not shown any symptom of nCoV when she was screened at the airport, but they had warned the Kochi airport about her upon learning that she was coming from Wuhan and was heading to her hometown via Kochi.“We had screened her with thermal guns and did all the necessary checks, but she had not shown any signs of infection at that point. But we alerted Kochi airport to keep tabs on the woman,” said a senior official of Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose International airport.According to records maintained by Kolkata airport, the woman came to the city on a China Eastern Airlines flight from Kunming on the night of January 23, the day the Wuhan airport was locked down. She had apparently come out of Wuhan along with some other Indian students the night before and was among the last batches of Indian nationals from Wuhan who could come back on their own. China Eastern Airlines has a direct flight between Kunming and Wuhan, but they suspended services on January 23.From Kolkata, she took a direct flight to Kochi on January 24, and then travelled by road to her hometown at Mathilakam. At Kochi airport, she was advised by officials to report to the nearest health centre if she showed any symptom of flu. She was asked to stay at home for the next 14 days, maintain personal hygiene and wear a mask.On January 27, she developed symptoms of flu and contacted the state health department, which sent a team of officials to her home and moved her to an isolation ward at the Thrissur General Hospital. Her body fluid sample was sent to the National Institute of Virology (NIV), Pune, the same day and on Thursday morning, the NIV informed that the case was positive.Following the first case, the Centre announced that all persons who have come from China after January 15 need to be tested for the virus as it has an incubation period of 14 days. It has also prescribed a 14-day home isolation procedure and advised citizens to avoid trips to China.“There could be scores of symptomless patients since signs of the virus take a week to 14 days to manifest. So, every individual who has travelled through the affected regions should be quarantined immediately after they reach India,” said Fortis Hospital’s internal medicine consultant Joydeep Ghosh.At Kolkata airport, passengers from China have to undergo thermal screening to check body temperature. Officials said that so far, 5,700 persons have been screened, but none have showed any alarming symptoms. The immigration and other staff members at airports have been sensitized and dedicated ambulances have been placed at ports. Drills to check preparedness and management of possible cases have also been practised at Kolkata airport and medical and para-medical staff have been kept on standby for emergencies.“However, no matter how rigorous the screenings are, we have to rely on self-declaration by passengers. We can never know if they visited Wuhan unless they declare it.

But on a sequential quarter basis, volumes were consistent since the June quarter.Faced with a double whammy of a steep rise in raw material costs and a de-growing soaps market, HUL plans to hike soap prices by 5-6%, beginning March this year. Although not strictly comparable, both sales and net profit numbers were sequentially lower in the December quarter as compared to the September quarter of the current fiscal.However, despite the market challenges in soaps and a delayed winter impacting growth in skin care, the FMCG bellwether reported a 12% rise in net profit in the December quarter of the current fiscal to Rs 1,616 crore, while growth in its domestic consumer business was up nearly 4% to Rs 9,696 crore. Tightening of belt in terms of costs is visible with growth in advertising and promotional spends muted in the December quarter. Cost of materials consumed in Q3 is down 13%.While rural market slowdown persisted in Q3 as well with rural growing below urban, a key highlight of the December quarter was a slowdown in the urban markets. “This quarter (December) witnessed an overall challenging market environment, mainly reflecting a sharp slowdown in rural and discretionary spends,” said HUL CMD Sanjiv Mehta.At the company’s third quarter (Q3) results update, HUL CFO Srinivas Phatak said the company will take prices up in a staggered manner. Cost of vegetable oils has risen by up to 30% over the previous year. While this could prop up the category’s value growth in forthcoming quarters, it may even backfire as consumer purchases have gone down in soaps. HUL had cut prices of soaps last year, and yet growth in personal wash has been elusive.Mehta said he hopes the Budget on Saturday boosts consumer confidence and puts more money in the customer’s hands.While home care and food and refreshments portfolios reported a 10% and 8% growths in Q3, respectively, the beauty and personal care portfolio declined 1%. Having a diversified portfolio, HUL was better positioned to navigate the challenging market conditions.Phatak said market growth continues to be sluggish and the near-term demand outlook remains challenging.

70,['1/02/2020'],Bihar: CPI(ML) plans to gherao state assembly on February 25,"This story is from February 1, 2020

Dipankar Bhattacharya

PATNA: CPI(ML) general secretary Dipankar Bhattacharya on Friday said the members of the party and its frontal organisations would gherao the state assembly on February 25 to press CM Nitish Kumar to get a resolution passed in the House against implementation of the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), National Population Register (NPR) and National Register of Citizens (NRC).

The budget session of the assembly is slated to begin from February 24 with the governor’s address to the joint session of the state legislature. Deputy CM-cum-finance minister Sushil Kumar Modi will present the state budget on February 25.

Dipankar, who was addressing the Jan Ekta meeting organized by Insaaf Manch at the open theatre of Bharatiya Nritya Kala Mandir here, said popular protests against the CAA, NPR and NRC that started from Shaheen Bagh in Delhi had spread to several cities and towns in the country as well as to institutions of higher education, including in Bihar , in the last one-and-a-half months.

Bhattacharya said though Nitish has admitted that some of the questions in the NPR questionnaire should be dropped, the issue is the withdrawal of CAA, NPR and NRC, as people have begun to realize the serious implications of the three instruments conceived by the Centre.

“Given the variety of proofs sought to prove one’s citizenship, the implementation of the three instruments would deprive more than six crores of people of the country of their citizenship,” Bhattacharya said, adding those shorn of their citizenship would not only be deprived of their civic and other rights, but also be disenfranchised and made become ineligible to own property or get into any kind of job in the country.

He said of the 19.5 lakh people deprived of citizenship in Assam due to implementation of the NRC on the orders of the Supreme Court, 56,000 had their roots in Bihar. The Assam government had sought details on 73,000 Biharis, but the Bihar government could provide details of only about 17,000 of them, he claimed.

KATHARIYA VILLAGE, FARRUKHABAD: When 25 children in UP’s Farrukhabad district entered Subhash Batham’s house on Thursday evening, apart from the missing confetti there was little indication that this wasn’t, in fact, a birthday party. They were welcomed by Batham’s wife into a 10 x 8 basement where several packets of snacks, biscuits, chocolates and milk were kept.The cold, mud floor was covered in mats for the kids to sit on. In the ensuing 10 hours in which the crisis unfolded, Batham and his wife reportedly took turns to check up on the kids, with the latter even serving them roti and sabzi.For these children in Kathariya village, most of whom were aged between one and 15, a birthday invite was as rare as it was alluring. Many hail from poor households, with their parents struggling to make ends meet. So when word spread around on Thursday afternoon that a party was to be held, they were eager to join the celebrations. Their parents too felt there was little reason to worry.Batham had a chequered past — he had spent 12 years in prison for killing his uncle — but he hadn’t displayed aggressive behaviour towards anyone in the village and as one villager said, “It had been years since that incident in 2001.” But within hours, as news came that Batham was armed and making demands to release the children, parents started assembling in front of the house, fearing the worst. Inside, the children were anxious but well-fed.A day later, many of the children TOI spoke to said they were still shocked with the turn of events but happy to be back home.The younger ones, however, showed little understanding that they had been at the centre of a raging drama that had everyone on tenterhooks. But most seemed to agree on one thing — their kidnapper was not out to harm them. “I don’t believe he (Batham) wanted to harm us. He warned us to keep quiet and said there would be consequences if we didn’t, but he didn’t hurt anyone,” said Anjali Kumari, the eldest among those who had been held hostage. Batham had a pistol and a rifle with him, said the children, but he never pointed it at them.On Friday, when TOI visited the spot, candy wrappers were strewn across the basement. Instead of a staircase, a ladder paved the way to the dingy space bereft of windows, with an LED bulb the only source of light. A metal door separated the basement from the rest of the house. It was this door that Anjali bolted shut after the children had been stuck in the room for hours and their patience started wearing thin. This cut off Batham’s access to the children and minimised their chances of getting caught in a crossfire. “After I locked the door, Subash uncle and his wife banged on the door several times, but I didn’t open it. Two hours later, we were rescued by police,” said Anjali.While initially scared, the children said they felt better once food was served. Arun Kumar, 10, said that the couple served everyone food and water. “We were given biscuit, chocolate, milk, water and some ate roti and sabzi. But when we wanted to pee, we were told to go in a corner and relieve ourselves,” added Soni Kumari, 12, who was confined along with two of her siblings. As there wasn’t much to do, some of the children went to sleep.When an infant wouldn’t stop crying, Batham decided to go outside to release her. That’s when Anjali shut the door from inside. The children didn’t have to wait long though. A couple of hours, later, police made their way to the building and shot Batham dead.Residents of the quiet village said they were still coming to terms with the incident that had shoved them into the limelight. But things could have turned out differently, said Babli Devi, whose house is next to Batham’s. “Three of my children were in there too. And I will always remember this traumatic night but would I have wanted them dead for it? I don’t think so. Perhaps, police could have caught Batham, instead of killing him.”A police officer said, “We negotiated with Batham for hours and went into the building to arrest him, but he brandished a gun. So we had to shoot.”In Video: Farrukhabad hostage drama: Unaware of trap children wanted to enjoy party",agra,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73828167,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-185234,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/he-gave-us-food-chocolates-some-of-us-went-off-to-sleep-kids-at-centre-of-up-hostage-drama/articleshow/73815355.cms

Urban development minister Ashutosh Tandon was here to lay the foundation of development projects worth over R... Read More

AGRA: Uttar Pradesh urban development minister Ashutosh Tandon on Friday said both state and the central governments are working on a plan on linking rivers.

The idea behind the interlinking of rivers is to deal with the problems of drought and floods affecting parts of the country, while decreasing farmer’ dependency on uncertain monsoon. The move is also aimed at curbing extraction of groundwater and developing an infrastructure for piped water supply to each household, he added.

Addressing a gathering at the Jal Sansthan here, minister Tandon said, “The underground water reserve is depleting rapidly. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has called for minimum usage of groundwater. State and central governments are working to ensure that piped water supply reaches each household. Soon, the work related to linking of the river will be initiated.”

The minister was here to lay the foundation of development projects worth over Rs 221 crore. Besides, Rs 33.25 crore projects of the civic body, those related with Agra Smart City, Jal Nigam and District Urban Development Agency (DUDA) were also launched.

Tandon said the river-linking project was mooted by the Atal Bihari Vajpayee-led NDA government in 1999. The proposal was modified to intra-basin development as opposed to inter-basin water transfer. By 2004, the then UPA government again opposed the project concept.

In February 2012, while disposing of a public interest litigation (PIL) on the matter, Supreme Court had refused to give any direction for implementation of “rivers interlinking project”. However, the apex court had directed the ministry of water resources to constitute an experts’ committee to pursue the matter with the governments concerned as no party had pleaded against the implementation of the project.

Regarding Agra, the minister said, “State government is focused on development of Agra. I am aware that lack of proper water supply infrastructure is a major problem in the city. We have been working in this regard. The officers of the urban development department have been directed to ensure all the houses in the city get piped water supply. Required infrastructure will be developed in a planned manner. Officials have also been directed to adopt time-bound repairs of the old water pipelines, which are subjected to wear and tear.”

In a ceremony organized at Agra Municipal Corporation, Tandon emphasized the need for public participation in the maintenance of sanitation and hygiene in the city. He also handed over keys of 50 houses to beneficiaries of the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojna of the central government and Asra scheme of the state government.

The minister laid the foundation of a plant which would have the capacity of processing 300 metric tonnes per day of biodegradable municipal solid waste into compost. The plant will be established at Kuberpur landfill site and is estimated to cost Rs 12 crore.

He also laid the foundation of the Rs 27.35-crore project for capping of waste at the Kuberpur landfill site, a Rs 175 crore work related to upgradation of water supply infrastructure and Rs 6.91 crore road, interlocking and drainage development works.

Tandon opened the Kanha shelter facility for cows and other destitute animals, a facility to process 120 metric tonnes per day of non-biodegradable waste, an automatic plant for processing waste collected from hotels, marriage halls and housing societies.

Under the smart city project, minister inaugurated smart classrooms developed at AMC’s inter college for girls in Tajganj locality, e-toilets developed at four places and four micro skill development centres.

The cubs inside the dilapidated school building in Rayadi village near Khambha in Amreli district

RAJKOT: When the sun gradually rose over Rayadi village on Friday and the villagers started moving around, these four little Simbas realized that they were in the middle of human habitation.

When mistaking them for dogs, a woman threw a stone at them, these lion cubs, aged three to 6 months, took shelter in an old dilapidated school building in the village.

Rayadi is a village surrounded by the forest of Rabarika in Tulsishyam range of Gir East of the Gir Wildlife Sanctuary. The nearest town is Khambha. This range is a home to about 25 to 30 lions. Lions are frequently sighted in Khambha and its surrounding villages.

It so happened that a lioness had entered the village on Thursday night with her four cubs.

The lioness had preyed on a cow and her cubs joined her on feast. Out in the open and under the sky over the village, the big cat and her cubs kept on feasting on the cow till early Friday morning. It was when the movements of the villagers started, the lioness abandoned her cubs and went back into the forest.

“The woman who had thrown a stone at the cubs, mistaking them for dogs, informed us, and we rushed to the spot. We rescued the cubs. As we knew the location of their mother, we took the cubs there. When we spotted the lioness, we released the cubs who went scampering towards their mother in the forest,” said a forest officer of Tulsishyam range.

MUMBAI: Indiabulls Real Estate, the listed arm of the Indiabulls group, and Bengaluru-based realty major Embassy, which is unlisted, have agreed to merge through a share-swap deal. After the merger, global private equity major Blackstone will infuse $200 million into the entity. As part of the deal, the merged entity will be controlled by Embassy and its promoter Jitu Virwani, while Sameer Gehlaut, the promoter of Indiabulls will become a passive shareholder. This will also mark the exit of Indiabulls Group from the real estate sector.

Exiting the real estate sector was part of Indiabulls Group’s plan when it was seeking to merge Lakshmi Vilas Bank with itself. The move was shelved after the RBI declined it the green signal.

The current shareholders of Indiabulls Real Estate will get the scrips of the merged entity, which will also be listed on the bourses. The share-swap ratio will be decided by independent valuers and merchant bankers, the company said. The promoters of Embassy Group and Blackstone will also hold shares in the merged entity.

After the merger, the company will become the development arm for the Embassy Office Park REIT, the first listed real estate investment trust in India which is a joint venture between Embassy Group and Blackstone. The REIT will benefit by getting more developed assets, thereby increasing the yield of the REIT, which intends to provide compounding returns to its unit holders by flow of regular assets in the instrument, company sources said.

Indiabulls group also has a strong relationship with Blackstone, which in the last two years have sold properties worth about Rs 12,000 crore to the PE giant. Currently, Embassy Office Park REIT has a market capitalisation of Rs 32,000 crore, while Indiabulls Real Estate is valued at Rs 4,865 crore. Since listing in April last year, Embassy’s REIT has given a 30% return to its investors.

Indiabulls Group founder & chairman Sameer Gehlaut said that the deal, which marks the exit of the group from real estate development business, is according to the plan that was announced in June 2019. “We will now fully focus on our financial services businesses,” Gehlaut said. Indiabulls Real Estate will have zero net debt at the time of the merger, the company said. After the deal was announced, the stock price of Indiabulls Real Estate on the BSE closed 5% higher at Rs 107.

PATNA: Urban development and housing department (UDHD) minister Suresh Kumar Sharma on Friday said the four-member committee formed to probe the causes for prolonged waterlogging in Patna in September last year, has found former Patna Municipal Corporation (PMC) commissioner Anupam Kumar Suman and former Bihar Urban Infrastructure Development Corporation (BUIDCO) managing director Amrendra Prasad Singh responsible for the menace.

Sharma told TOI over phone on Friday that necessary action would soon be initiated against the two officers based on the report of the probe committee.

“Anupam Suman and Amrendra Singh have been mainly found responsible for waterlogging in Patna and action will be taken against them. We have already initiated action against many engineers of BUIDCO, who were found negligent in performing their duties,” Sharma said.

Earlier, the four-member committee headed by development commissioner Arun Kumar Singh was formed by the state government on October 14 and it was tasked to submit a report based on its findings in a month.

“The committee had submitted its report on waterlogging in Patna to the home department more than a month ago,” development commissioner Singh said.

Home department additional chief secretary Amir Subhani said the report would be sent to UDHD.

UDHD secretary Anand Kishor said the department had not received the report till Friday evening.

Earlier, chief secretary Deepak Kumar had announced the formation of the high-level committee after CM Nitish Kumar held over a four-hour-long meeting on October 14 with top bureaucrats to discuss the waterlogging issue in the city.

Other members in the committee included principal secretaries of road construction department Amrit Lal Meena, disaster management department Pratyaya Amrit and finance department S Siddhartha. The committee members were tasked to find the reasons and lapses behind waterlogging and prepare a plan to address the issue of recurring waterlogging in the city.

Three days of torrential rain from September 27 last year had submerged many localities of Patna, especially Rajendra Nagar, Kankarbagh, Sanichhra and Pataliputra.

UDHD had earlier taken action against 11 senior officers of BUIDCO, including a chief engineer, two superintendent engineers and seven executive engineers for negligence. PMC had taken action against two of its executive engineers, a city manager and six sanitary inspectors. The state government had even transferred UDHD principal secretary Prasad to science and technology department in the same capacity and BUIDCO MD Amrendra Prasad Singh was made administrator in Bihar State Road Transport Corporation.

Mumbai: It’s been a volatile seven months for Dalal Street investors since the last Budget by finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman on July 5, 2019, with the sensex up 1,201 points or 3% to Friday’s close at 40,732, while some of the other indices have lost ground.

Riding the gains in blue chips like Bharti Airtel (up 36%), Asian paints (32%), ICICI Bank (20.5%), HUL (13.6%) and Reliance Industries (12%), investors’ wealth also jumped by a little over Rs 5 lakh crore with the BSE’s market capitalisation now almost at Rs 156 lakh crore.

The gains in the last seven months since the Budget had come mainly on the back of buying by mutual funds, which together bought stocks worth Rs 45,300 crore. Foreign funds, however, mostly remained muted with a net inflow at Rs 1,632 crore. One of the main triggers for the rally since the last Budget was the government’s September 20 decision to cut corporate taxes sharply that added a little over 1,900 points, or 5% to the index in a single session.

Outside of the index, stocks of insurance and mutual fund companies recorded stellar gains with HDFC MF up over 60%, ICICI Life up 28% and HDFC Life up 26%. Stocks of pharma and related sectors also showed good gains, BSE data showed.

Among the business groups, investors in Adani Group saw their total wealth rise by 19% or by nearly Rs 33,500 crore to almost Rs 2.1 lakh crore. The shareholders of HDFC group also saw their total wealth rise by nearly 6% or by almost Rs 70,000 crore to Rs 12.8 lakh crore. This professionally managed financial services group still remains the most valued business house in India.

Rajkot: A businessman lodged an attempt to murder complaint against four persons with the Malaviyanagar police station in Rajkot on Friday.

In his complaint, Hari Bambhawa alleged that the accused, identified as his cousin Vikram Shiyaliya, Hamir Shiyaliya, Lakhman Shiyaliya, and an unidentified associate tried to kill him by ramming his car twice with their car on Gondal Road.

86,['1/02/2020'],"SBI sees highest quarterly net of Rs 5,583cr in Oct-Dec","This story is from February 1, 2020

Mumbai: SBI reported its highest ever quarterly net profit of Rs 5,583 crore — up 41% from the corresponding quarter of the previous year. The gains were bolstered by a sharp jump in net interest income.

This was partly because of the recovery of Rs 11,000 crore following the resolution of the Essar Steel default due to its sale to ArcelorMittal under the insolvency process.

The bank managed to grow its net interest income (NII) by 22% to Rs 22,779 crore despite loan growth being subdued at less than 7%. This was because the bank managed to cap the increase in interest outgo to less than 1% despite deposits growing by 10%.

“For the quarter, our net interest margin (NIM) was 3.59%. If we remove the impact of the Essar Steel recovery, the NIM would be 3.37%. We are maintaining the cost of deposits very well and passing on the benefit to the borrower, which is how we have managed to maintain our NIM,” said chairman Rajnish Kumar .

Kumar said that in the current quarter, the bank was anticipating recovery from one large steel company and a textile company. “Going forward, it is now credit growth that is on my wish list. If there is credit growth, our NII will go up. If we can grow credit at 12% instead of 7%, it will mean an additional credit growth of Rs 1.5 lakh crore, which will improve NII by Rs 4,000-5,000 crore,” he said.“SBI reported results were in line with estimates on healthy growth and asset quality. One-time gain from Essar Steel resolution sale was utilised for a housing finance company (DHFL) provision, divergence and deferred tax asset adjustment (DTA) for lower tax adoption,” said ICICI Securities in a note.

According to Kumar, adjustments towards DTA were complete and, from next quarter, the bank would record full benefit of lower tax rates.

“Results for Q3 had several moving parts, but on the whole the performance was healthy. The management appeared confident and has taken the full impact of FY19 divergences, and still posted healthy operating performance. We believe SBI is well on its way of declining asset stress,” said Lalitabh Shrivastawa, deputy vice-president, Sharekhan.

The profits would have been higher but for the provisions on DHFL, which was classified as an NPA during the quarter. Besides loans to DHFL, SBI had also purchased a pool of home loans disbursed by the stressed housing finance company. Kumar said that the bank had done thorough due diligence before purchasing the loans. “We do very thorough due diligence at the time of purchase of the pool. We will have a relook in light of what the enforcement directorate has said,” said Kumar.

BHOPAL: Gandhi Nagar on city outskirts has emerged as the most unsafe area for minor girls with around 12 rape cases being reported in 2019. Habibganj and Kolar shared the second spot with nine cases each while six cases each were reported from TT Nagar, Govindpura and Shahjehanabad areas in 2019.Kolar, Habibganj, Ashoka Garden and Piplani topped in number of rape cases reported by women. A dozen cases each were reported in these areas during 2019. Chhola and Piplani topped in molestation of minor girls with 17 and 16 cases being reported respectively during the year.As per the data released by Bhopal police, out of 342 rape cases in 2019, 147 were of minor girls, a rise of around 10% than 2018. There was a spurt in abduction cases of women in 2019 with 674 cases being reported, a rise of around 80% as compared to 2018 when 373 abduction cases were reported.Senior police officers claimed that demographic and socio-economic disparity factors were the main reason behind rise in crime against minor girls in these areas. Officers maintained police along with NGOs have started interacting with people residing in the areas where the rate of crime against women is high and spreading awareness on sensitising people about measures to stop such crimes.Speaking on issue of rise in abduction cases, cops maintained that in most cases girl and boy elope, but since they are minors, a case of abduction is registered against the boy. In many cases sections of rape is also added. Cops claimed that it is a social issue and should be addressed accordingly. When asked why high number of crime against women and girls were reported in Gandhi Nagar, Chhola and Nishatpura area, CSP Lokesh Sinha said that police take incidents of crime against women and children very seriously and registers case in every incident reported, so there is rise in numbers.He said Gandhi Nagar is on city outskirts while Chhola and Nishatpura are densely-populated areas. All three areas have people mostly from economically weaker section. In most families, both parents work and leave their children at home with neighbours or relatives during daytime. CSP Sinha said police teams visit and interact with people in slum areas regularly and are spreading awareness to sensitise people on the issue.Speaking on rise in crime against women and girls in Piplani and Govidpura area, CSP Amit Kumar said there are many girls’ hostels and many students from other cities reside there. Many a times, boys stalk or make obscene phone calls to girls. In many cases it was found that the boy and the girl were friend and after a dispute the boy started harassing her.CSP Kumar said a large part of these areas fall under the BHEL township. There are several slum areas in the jurisdiction in which migratory labourers reside. Many cases of crime against women were reported from these areas.Speaking on rise in number of rape and molestation cases in Kolar, CSP Bhupinder Singh said the jurisdiction of Kolar police station is very wide. More than 40 slum areas are situated in the area and there is socio-economic disparity. The area is overpopulated and underdeveloped. Similar is the case with Habibganj area where many slum areas are located. Most of the cases were reported from these areas.CSP Singh added that increasing use of social media platforms have also led to increase in crime against women cases. Women and girls come in contact with strangers over social media platforms and become friends. Many a times, unidentified people exploit women and girls.A senior woman cop wishing anonymity said many cases of molestation and rape go unreported as people fear social stigma.“People need to be made aware that such incident must be reported as it happens,” she added.Director Childline Archana Sahay said the National Crime Record Bureau (NCRB) reports state that in cases of crime against children the involvement of known people was around 95 to 97%. It is important to teach the children differences between good touch and bad touch.DIG Irshad Wali said that police along with NGOs and social organisations have already started spreading awareness on measures to control crime against women and children by visiting in different areas of the city. Special focus is on economically weaker and slum areas from where such cases were reported in the past. The joint teams conduct counselling sessions and ask women to install MPeCop App on their phones which can be used in SOS situation.He said police have identified the spots with high rate of harassment complaints. ‘Maitri’ teams and Shakti Squads regularly visit in these areas, especially school and colleges and keep a check on miscreants.”",bhopal,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73838081,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-781137,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/women-safety-another-forgettable-year-as-rape-abduction-cases-rise/articleshow/73817090.cms
88,['1/02/2020'],Small savings hold up interest rate reduction,"Mumbai: Small savings rates are preventing rate cuts by the RBI from being passed on to the banking system, the Economic Survey indicated, reiterating a point made by the central bank in the past. Until rates on small savings like the public provident fund ( PPF ) fall, term deposit rates are unlikely to decline.Although there is a formula where small savings rates are reset by the government every quarter, the revision has not been very effective. In December 2019, RBI governor Shaktikanta Das had said in the context of monetary policy transmission that there is also a need for greater flexibility in adjustment in interest rates on small saving schemes.The survey has pointed out that while there has been a reduction in the savings deposit rate by 25 basis points (100bps = 1 percentage point) in 2019, the term deposit rate, which is more important, has seen a decline of only 16bps from January 2019 to October 2019. “An important limiting factor seems to be the rates on small savings schemes like PPF. In 2014, the weighted average term deposit rate was the same as PPF, however, the gap between them is 115bps at October-end 2019,” the survey said.Das had in his policy said the RBI has communicated its vieAccording to the survey, RBI’s monetary easing and release of liquidity have had some impact on short term interest rates. However, this impulse is not feeding through to longer-term maturities. Since beginning of the year, yields on short term government securities (364 days T-bill) have declined much faster than that of long-term government securities (10-year G-sec).Typically when the RBI cuts rates, yields on government bonds fall. A fall in yields hikes price of existing stock of government bonds held by banks, who make profit by selling these bonds. At the same time, it also brings down the cost of fresh government borrowings as the RBI can issue long-term bonds at lower rates.However, after August 2019 the yield on 10-year government bonds has not declined much, barring the small decline after special open market operations by the RBI. Despite a decrease in policy rates, credit growth in the economy has been declining since the beginning of this year. Bank credit growth moderated from 12.9% in April 2019 to 7.1% as on December 20, 2019.",business,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73838424,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-63390,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/small-savings-hold-up-interest-rate-reduction/articleshow/73818244.cms

Political parties use farm debt waivers as a key tool to win over farmers (Reuters)

NEW DELHI: Political parties use farm debt waivers as a key tool to win over farmers , but such an option does not get the support of the Economic Survey which on Friday said debt waivers not only disrupt credit culture but also choke formal credit flow to farmers.

Though the Survey did not reject government intervention outright, it suggested that government “must systematically examine areas of needless intervention and undermining of markets”. Referring to past debt waivers by states and the Centre, the Survey said, “The full waiver beneficiaries consume less, save less, invest less and are less productive after the waiver, compared to the partial beneficiaries.” It said eliminating such instances will enable competitive markets, spurring investments and economic growth.

The Survey noted that though the phenomenon of granting debt waivers to farmers just before or after an election had died down in the early nineties, the practice saw a revival after the large-scale farm debt waiver announced by the Union government in 2008.

Referring to studies which analysed impact of debt waivers in different states, the Survey said it was clear that “an unconditional and blanket debt waiver is a bad idea. It does not achieve any meaningful real outcomes for the intended beneficiaries while the costs to the exchequer are significant.”

Kerala has not implemented any of these acts. The budget does not inspire any hope for the state,” said Sunilkumar.

Finance minister Thomas Isaac said that the budget does not offer anything concrete for agriculture sector apart from pompous statements. The allocation under the sector is also the same as that of previous fiscal, he said.

Officials said that a proposal being mooted in the budget may evoke the state's interest; the one that proposes making use of self-help groups. The budget proposes a village storage scheme as a backward linkage run by self-help groups. This will provide farmers a good holding capacity and reduce their logistics cost.

He further said that residential buildings having an area up to 2,000sq ft and constructed before 2016 were exempted from the revised tax rate.

He further said that houses having 660sq ft need not remit any type of tax if the house owner only has a single house. The tax exemption is not applicable to house owners who have two residential houses in his name and carried out modifications before.

The raw water tanks made of concrete were found to be leaking.

AGRA: The Gangajal water treatment facility at Jeevani Mandi water works station here inaugurated by state urban development minister Ashutosh Tandon on Friday was found to be leaking at over a dozen places. The inlet and tube settler unit for supply of Ganga water in different parts of the city had been operationalized on January 21.

Under the Rs 2,887-crore Gangajal project, funded by Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA), Agra is getting 140 cusecs of Ganga water from Palra headworks in Bulandshahr's Upper Ganga canal. For this, a 130-km pipeline was laid. The project was launched in 2005 and its deadline has been forwarded several times.

Under the project, Jeevani Mandi water works station is being upgraded. In December 2019, the upgradation of 225 million litre per day (MLD) capacity raw water treatment plant was completed.

After inspection of the facility by the minister, who was accompanied by principal secretary Manoj Kumar Singh and managing director of the Jal Nigam Vikas Gothalwal, the raw water tanks made of concrete were found to be leaking.

On inspection, TOI found over a dozen leakages in the base of the treatment facility. The drain pipes were covered with rust. At several spots, sealants were applied to stop the leakage.

According to sources, over Rs 92 crore has been sent on upgrading the Jeevani Mandi water works station. A private company was contracted for development of the 225 MLD water treatment plant. The leakages have occurred due to flaw in design and use of sub-standard quality material in constructing the tanks, it is learnt.

When questioned about the leakages in the Gangajal treatment facility , minister Tandon said, “The matter has not come to my knowledge. I will talk to the officials in this regard. The matter will be investigated.”

Gothalwal said, “Usually leakages do not take place in a water treatment facility. The reason behind the leakages will be investigated. Suitable action will be taken.”

AGRA: Though the Aligarh Muslim University ( AMU ) administration has decided to reschedule examinations after commencement of classes in a few faculties, a section of students have intensified their protests in the campus on Friday and refused to resolve any issue without the resignation of VC, registrar and proctor.

According to administrative officials, the situation is getting worse by the day and if students don’t relent, the university could be closed for some time. The VC, Tariq Mansoor, has already indicated the possibility of shutting down the university, if the campus protest continue and call for a lockdown is not withdrawn. He has stated this in an open letter addressed to students earlier this week.

On Thursday evening, the VC again appealed to students and members of the teaching staff to help in resorting normalcy and functioning of academic activities in a peaceful manner. In a video released by the AMU administration, the VC expressed deep regret at the unfortunate incidents that took place on the intervening night of December 15 and 16.

He further assured, “As far as other grievances of students are concerned, all issues will be discussed, once normalcy is restored.”

Though the university reopened after a month-long winter break on January 13, protests against the ‘police action’ on CAA protesters have continued in the campus, with demands of resignation of Vice-Chancellor Tariq Mansoor, Registrar Abdul Hamid and Proctor Afifullah Khan for their “failure to protect the students”.

Other demands include withdrawal of all “false cases” registered against protesting students, no further police action or harassment against those who carry out peaceful protests on campus. The students are also seeking an assurance that no information related to students will be passed on to police and local intelligence unit, and in future, police won’t be allowed into the campus. Though the administration has agreed to most of these demands, the students are refusing to relent.

University spokesperson, Shafey Kidwai, said that the administration is making all efforts to restore normalcy in the campus. He said, “We are hopeful of bringing back normalcy by Monday.”

Thiruvananthapuram: With the ruling LDF taking a strong position against the notice served by opposition leader Ramesh Chennithala, the business advisory committee (BAC) of the state assembly decided not to allow the substantive motion under rule 130 requesting the President to call back governor Arif Mohammad Khan .

In the BAC meeting, opposition UDF leaders pressed for the notice but parliamentary affairs minister A K Balan disputed all arguments and conveyed without any doubt that the treasury benches were not willing to allow the motion. With the government detaching itself from the move to humiliate the governor, a truce between governor and the council of ministers , who had been at loggerheads over the Supreme Court suit filed by the state challenging the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, has been in place.

Speaker P Sreeramakrishan who had earlier said that the notice was in accordance with rules took a stand in BAC that discussion on the 130 notice could be held only with the permission of treasury benches. Minister Balan, said sources, disputed even the existence of the notice saying that the Speaker hadn’t accepted it. He also said there was no precedence of the assembly discussing such a notice.

Later Balan told reporters that the session would be running with a tight schedule and there wouldn’t be time to discuss the motion. He said that practical reasons as well as legal angles prompted the government to take a stand against the notice. “We also don’t want to allow the issues between governor and government to escalate”, he said.

Opposition leader Ramesh Chennithala alleged that the stand of the government once again exposed the tacit understanding between the government and the governor. He said the ruling front doesn’t have the courage to take on governor. “Had this resolution be discussed and passed, that would have been a lesson for entire country. Kerala assembly had set several models for other houses. This would have warned PM Narendra Modi and home minister Amit Shah against using governors to unsettle state governments,” Chennithala told reporters.

He also disputed the arguments of Balan. “The position that there was no precedent in the state assembly is not correct. In 1969, when EMS was the CM, the Kerala assembly passed a resolution condemning certain actions of West Bengal Governor. Later, when E K Nayanar was the CM, the then Speaker Varkala Radhakrishnan allowed a resolution that registered the dissatisfaction of the assembly over a decision taken by governor Ramdulari Sinha. The Tamil Nadu assembly had passed a resolution demanding to recall governor when Jayalalithaa was the CM,” said Chennithala.

Thiruvananthapuram: As first step towards integrating road safety lessons in the school curriculum, Kerala Road Safety Authority (KRSA), National Transportation Planning and Research Centre (NATPAC) and State Council of Educational Research and Training (SCERT) have jointly published a handbook on road safety for teachers.

‘Surakshithayatra’, published with an aim to inculcate the habit of following traffic rules among students from primary class, was released by transport minister A K Saseendran recently.

“The integration of road safety rules in school syllabus has been a long-term project and it is being implemented now. The handbook for teachers is just the beginning of this initiative, which is the first ever attempt in the country. Next, mapping will be conducted on how to include the lessons in the school textbooks, as the lessons has to be different for each standard based on their class level.

For example, road safety rules can be included in social science and first aid can be part of biology,” said Rajagopal K, director, communication and public relations, Kerala Road Safety Authority. “There have been enquiries from the Centre about the handbook and we are planning to translate it to English,” he added.

The 110-page book, which begins with a note to teachers, consists of details related to safety of motorists, passengers and pedestrians, traffic rules and first aid. The matter is explained with representative picture and there are questions and answers section and activities for teachers in the book.

Around two lakh copies of the book will be printed and distributed among school teachers across the state. The handbook will be part of vacation training classes for teachers to be held in the next academic year.

“The revision of school curriculum has started as per the directive from the Centre. Regarding the integration of road safety lessons in school textbooks, decision will have to be taken whether to include the lessons in textbooks or as a separate book for children to read,” said J Prasad, director, SCERT.

As part of the activity, road safety clubs will be formed in all government schools after school reopens in the next academic year. “Road safety lessons are likely to be introduced in the curriculum in 2021-22 academic year. Road safety is a matter to be dealt at the grassroot level and integrating it in the school syllabus is the apt way to reduce the number of accidents. There are notes and pamphlets on traffic rules, but it is the first time that a detailed book for school is published. It is proposed to start the training programme for teachers in schools located near national highway and state highway for the safety of students,"" said an official from SCERT.

KOLKATA: An international campaign to restore Satyajit Ray , Mrinal Sen and Ritwik Ghatak ’s ancestral homes in Bangladesh has been initiated. The decision was taken on Thursday at the central executive committee meeting of the Federation of Film Societies of India (FFSI), founded by Ray in 1959.“The matter will be taken up at the international level so that the Bangladesh government gives due importance to preserve all the three ancestral homes of the great masters of world cinema. The issue will be brought to the notice of the Indian government’s ministry of culture, Indian National Trust for Art and Cultural Heritage and Unesco,” said Premendra Mazumder, vice-president of FFSI and the Asia Pacific secretary of the International Federation of Film Societies (IFFS).Ghatak’s home in Rajshahi was leased by then military government of Hussain Muhammad Ershad to a private homoeopathy college in the 80s. A recent plan to demolish to make way for a bicycle garage raised a hue and cry among residents and intellectuals in Bangladesh and abroad, with protests being held in in Rajshahi, Dhaka and Toronto. Film personalities of Bangladesh, including Tanvir Mokammel, Morshedul Islam, Nasiruddin Yousuff Bachchu and Shameem Akhtar, staged demonstrations and signed a petition, asking the Bangaldesh government to save not only Ghatak’s home but also that of Ray and Sen. The demolition plan was stalled.While Ray’s ancestral home is at Mashua in Kishoreganj, Sen’s house is in Faridpur’s Jhiltuli. Ray’s ancestral house is in a dilapidated state now. “Film activists of Dhaka had appealed to the government through the district administration for its immediate renovation and preservation. Sen’s ancestral house has a private owner. Restoring it might prove to be a challenge, unless the current owner cooperates. Most of the property has been demolished to build a new structure. But parts of the original house still remain and can be renovated,” Mazumder added.Directors in Bangladesh have welcomed FFSI’s initiative. Bachchu told TOI from Dhaka, “The work on building the bicycle garage at Ghatak’s home was stalled. We are now trying to convince the government to build a Ritwik Cultural Centre there. Ghatak’s Dhaka-based niece, Aroma Dutta, an MP, is supporting the cause. We are happy with FFSI initiative.”Ghatak’s grandniece Ina Puri, who will visit Bangladesh soon, is equally happy: “Given that his twin, Pratiti Devi, died only weeks ago, the need to preserve the legacy of my granduncle’s ancestral home becomes more important now, than ever before. It will be wonderful if his house is preserved, and perhaps, made into a museum.” The Ray family has also welcomed the move.",kolkata,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73839013,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-483114,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/global-campaign-to-restore-satyajit-ritwik-mrinals-ancestral-homes-in-bangladesh/articleshow/73817163.cms
100,['1/02/2020'],Traders organise ‘budhi-sudhi yagya’ to protest against Agra Municipal Corporation,"This story is from February 1, 2020

Agra: On the eighteenth day of the indefinite strike, traders of Sanjay Place on Friday organized a ‘ budhi-sudhi yagya ’ to protest against the Agra Municipal Corporation over the issue of parking fee. Traders gathered at the dharna spot in the parking space raised slogans against the AMC administration and mayor Naveen Jain .

Meanwhile, Congress and Samajwadi Party leaders also participated in the trader's protest. Congress workers led by state secretary Shabana Khandelwal begged to register their protest against AMC. In support of the traders, national general secretary of Samajwadi Party Ramjilal Suman addressed the traders and declared support in the protest.

Since January 14, traders in Sanjay Place are on an indefinite strike against the Agra Municipal Corporation (AMC) administration for charging parking fee at 38 places in the market. They claimed that it violates norms as they had already paid a fee for parking at the time of purchasing the property.

President of the Sanjay Place market association, KN Agnihotri said, “The dispute over parking fee between traders of Sanjay Place and AMC is sub judice. We want AMC to cancel the parking contracts till the court delivers its final orders in the matter. In this regard, we had handed over a memorandum to the urban development minister Ashutosh Tandon at the circuit house. Few BJP leaders who were around the minister didn’t allowed us to explain the entire matter.”

Hiren Agarwal, secretary of the market association, said, “The AMC administration is trying to exploit traders by illegally charging the parking fee. We have already paid for the parking space. To muzzle the voice of the traders, a fake FIR has been registered. We will continue our fight against the parking mafia.”

Association’s treasurer Vinay Mittal alleged that despite the ongoing case at the sessions court, the AMC administration had issued parking contracts for three years to people associated with the BJP. “AMC officials also get a share of the parking fee illegally collected from the market. We will not withdraw our protest till the AMC rolls back its decision,” he said.

AGRA: The National Green Tribunal (NGT) on Friday directed the Uttar Pradesh government to probe the allegations of encroachment of public land, water bodies and heritage sites under the garb of social services by an NGO in Mathura’s Goverdhan. The NGT asked the UP to get the probe done by some central agency.

A bench headed by Justice Raghuvendra S Rathore said that they are of a considered opinion that a prima-facie case of encroachment of public land, heritage sites as well as water bodies is made out against the NGO. Therefore, the state government should have this case investigated by any central agency, which shall place a report before the competent authority for appropriate orders.

The bench said that this action is immediately warranted because of “continuous destruction of environment.”

The directions came on a plea filed by ‘ Giriraj Parikrama Sanrakshan Sansthan’ seeking directions to Uttar Pradesh government for conducting investigation against the “illegal” actions of the NGO.

102,['1/02/2020'],Goa meets January GST target with 14% increase in mop-up,"This story is from February 1, 2020

Representative image

PANAJI: Goa’s goods and services tax ( GST ) collections for the current financial year have shown an 8.76% year-on-year increase with the tax mop-up in January hitting the monthly target, even showing a 14% increase for the month over last, the authorities said. However, in comparison to the tax revenue under the VAT regime, the state is facing an over 30% shortfall in tax earnings.

Commissioner for GST Deepak Bandekar told TOI that the GST collection for the April-December period stood at Rs 1,668 crore against Rs 1,533.8 crore for the same period in 2018-19.

“In October we had negative collections, but November and December showed good growth. For December there was a 30.9% growth,” Bandekar said.

For January, Goa collected Rs 412.7 crore in GST as on January 28 and with the state meeting its monthly target, no compensation is due from the Centre for the month.

Bandekar said that while the growth in GST collections was encouraging, the state is still not meeting its annual GST collection targets. According to a senior finance department official, Goa has seen a 30% shortfall in GST collections in comparison to the tax revenue earned under the VAT regime.

In 2017-18, Goa pulled in an average of Rs 171 crore per month, which increased in 2018-19 to Rs 183.5 crore per month on an average.

“The GST rates for 250-300 items have been reduced and this is bound to affect the collections,” Bandekar said.

The reduction in GST rates for hotels has led to a Rs 100 crore cut in tax collections for the state.

The department of commercial taxes and state GST has also initiated action to plug tax leakages, especially from unregistered hotels and guesthouses. A special drive was organised to crack down on businessmen who are evading GST registration.

“We have identified and are initiating action against such evaders. Two hundred and twelve cases have been identified,” Bandekar said.

The department of commercial taxes has also penalised 153 vehicles for not filing e-way bills for inter-state transport of goods. It has collected fines amounting to Rs 90 lakh through fines for e-way bill violations.

103,['1/02/2020'],Mixed reaction from professionals over new income tax slabs,"This story is from February 1, 2020

Thiruvananthapuram: The new amendment in income tax, proposed in the Union Budget by finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman, evoked mixed reaction among professionals in the city. The choice to let go of the deductions or to opt for reduced slab of tax has led to confusion among the people.

“In a first look, it seems newly proposed income tax slabs will benefit people, but when we checked in detail, it was not the case. The new scheme removed all deductions and that would reduce the investments of employees. Earlier, mployees were forced to invest some amount or try to invest in different schemes to get the benefit of tax saving. That indirectly helped them to have some investments that’s unlikely with the new scheme. Industries like ours which don’t have any retirement benefits will get benefited from these savings. The government is trying to project this scheme as a benefit for tax payers, but actually trying to discourage long term investments, said Raneesh A R, president of Prathidhwani, a socio-cultural organisation of techies.

CA Ramakrishnan H, secretary of The Institute of Chartered Accountants of India, Thiruvananthapuram branch said that the amendments relating to income tax are mere eyewash as far as the individuals are concerned. “Because the new liberalised slabs are applicable only if they are willing to forgo the concession given for investments such as housing loan interest. It is of no use to people, if they want to avail 80C reductions, housing loan reduction, standard deduction of Rs 50,000. Concessions are applicable only if they forgo these concessions. Overall, the budget is good as it gives thrust to agriculture sector, manufacturing sector and rural area, the amendment in income tax could have been avoided,” said Ramakrishnan.

Progressive Techies, a forum of IT employees said that the old regime of income tax is a better option for them and new provision discourage people from investing.

“There is confusion on the new tax amendment among techies. Even though the income tax per slab has been reduced, the decision to exempt the deductions has caused confusion. So, techies who have invested as per the old tax regime are in trouble. And, those who doesn’t have any investment or housing loan may avail the new provision in income tax. Also, the new regime results in discouraging them from doing investments,” said Anand P, general secretary, Progressive Techies.

Ramakant Khalap

PORVORIM: Amid public outcry to protect Goa’s land and prevent its sale to non-Goans, MLAs cutting across party lines have failed to close loopholes in the law that allow farmers to sell their agricultural land to non-agriculturists and business entities, said former Union minister and legislator Ramakant Khalap on Friday.

He said the state’s land revenue code, the Goa Mundkar Act, 1975, and the Goa, Daman & Diu Agricultural Tenancy Act, 1964, need to be amended and implemented in a time-bound manner.

“Goa’s biggest defect has been these loopholes in the laws and the failures of the legislators to remain vigilant about what the law says and does not say and to close these loopholes through proper legislation,” Khalap said. He was addressing reporters at a workshop on assembly proceedings organised by the Goa legislature secretariat and Goa Union of Journalists.

The former Union minister said that despite the tenancy act and mundkar act coming into force in the 1960s and the 1970s, respectively, issues have not been resolved till date.

“Is it not the duty of the legislators to see to it that a certain sunset clause, a date by which even the last vestige of this slavery is removed? Amendment motions should be moved to that act, so that once and for all, this issue can be solved,” Khalap said.

He said Goa’s land revenue code does not contain provisions to prevent the sale of agricultural land to non-agriculturists and the law, which was rolled out in 1978, permits virtually any non-agriculturist, businessman, company or person to buy land in the state.

Khalap, who headed the Goa Law Commission, said that the state needs to separate the judicial functions of mamlatdars from their administrative and executive functions so that pending mundkar and tenancy cases are resolved quickly.

He also said that it is the duty of the legislators to ensure that the government updates land records in Goa.

Kerala CM Pinarayi Vijayan

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The state government has ordered the temporary attachment of the properties of an under-probe chit fund firm accused of cheating investors to the tune of Rs 16 crore.

Additional chief secretary (home affairs) Vishwas Mehta , on Thursday, issued the order to attach 2.53 acres of M/s Tathwamasi Chits and Investments Private Limited and M/s Tathwamasi Ayurday Resorts Private Limited.

The order to attach the property at Edavanakkad , Ernakulam was issued under Section 3 of the Kerala Protection of Interests of Depositors in Financial Establishment Act, 2013.

The section empowered the government to pass an interim order to attach the property of any financial establishment—and transfer it to a competent authority—if the firm defaulted in returning the deposits, with interest, after maturity. The government also entrusted the Ernakulam district collector to apply before a special court to implement the attachment order. The order was issued based on a recommendation by the collector. The recommendation followed a proposal by the superintendent of police, crime branch, Thrissur, who found the property was acquired by using the money collected by allegedly cheating the investors.

The firm has been facing 88 cases, registered across the state under sections 406, 420 and 34 of the IPC, relevant sections of the Chit Funds Act, 1982, and Kerala Protection of Interests of Depositors in Financial Establishment Act, 2013.

In Thrissur alone, 45 cases were registered. “Investigation revealed that the accused directors of the company, with the intention of cheating the public and extracting money from them, collected huge amounts under the guise of chit business and acquired movable and immovable properties,” the order said.

Students of Loreto schools in the city perform at the event at Allen Park

KOLKATA: It’s not enough to talk about violence against women only. Voices have to be raised against atrocities on minorities and the marginalized as well, and anyone who is feeling insecure in the current circumstances, when even something as basic as citizenship is coming up for questioning. This was the rhetoric at the three-hour One Billion Rising programme organised by the Loreto nuns at Allen Park on Friday.

Hundreds of students at Loreto schools in the city gathered to sing, dance and add voice to the “Rising”, the sixth celebration in the city of the global movement started in the US by writer-women’s rights activist Eve Ensler in 2012. The concept is based on the fact that one out of every three women worldwide is subjected to violence at least once in lifetime. The OBR organiser in the city, Kolkata Mary Ward Social Centre, is a unit of the Loreto order and this year, it collaborated with Loreto Elliot Road to bring the Rising to life. Every year, one Loreto school, along with the Mary Ward, carries the baton.

The slogan, ‘Rise, Resist, Unite,’ also included voices against CAA and NRC , following a resolution to this effect taken at the OBR Delhi headquarters. “At OBR, people are taught to respect women, but as things stand now, there is an atmosphere of fear and uncertainty in the entire civil society. OBR is a natural platform of protest and hence, we are using it as an umbrella to include minorities and their fears. Let OBR be the platform, where we can preach respect for the Constitution,” said Nandini Bhattacharjee, a teacher at Loreto Elliot Road who coordinated the programme.

The chief of the city’s OBR, Monica Suchiang, a Loreto nun, also the director of Mary Ward, felt women worldwide have been rising, pledging to stand by one another. “The conviction is uncanny… you have finally met your tormentor eye-to-eye and that is the magic moment when you know you have conquered him,” Sister Suchiang said. The Superior of Loreto order, Sister Sabrina, was also present at the event.

The high point of the programme was the discussion, Addressing Inequality Challenges, where ‘inequality’ transcended ‘gender issues’ and encompassed discrimination meted out to religious minorities and communities. The speakers included Nandita Pal Choudhury, Anchita Ghatak, Deep Purakayastha, Saira Halim, Madiha Ahmed and Nick Rampal. The talk was moderated by Anglo Indian MLA Shane Calvert. The speakers likened the current political situation to fascism. “Even a few years ago, the challenges of being a woman was there but I was not made to feel like a minority,” said Halim, a social activist and writer. Calvert pointed out that mankind progressed only when there was tolerance and congratulated the organizers for extending the scope of OBR this time.

110,['1/02/2020'],NGO for recovery of Rs 966 crore from mining companies for illegal operations,"This story is from February 1, 2020

PANAJI: After halting illegal mining in the state by approaching the Supreme Court seven years ago, NGO Goa Foundation has filed a petition in the high court of Bombay at Goa seeking recovery of over Rs 966 crore from mining companies involved in extraction of iron ore through illegal mining.

It has sought recovery from mining companies operating from 2007 to 2012 and between October 15, 2015 and March 15, 2018.

The NGO has sought direction to the state government to deposit the amount recovered from the mining companies in the Goa Iron Ore Permanent Fund.

Goa Foundation has sought prosecution of those persons (including officials) responsible for violating the Environment Protection Act, 1986 and provisions of the MDMR Act, 1957, as amended.

“Pending hearing and final disposal of this petition for an order restraining disposal of assets by mining companies and all owners, directors, key officers involved in such illegal mining should not be allowed to travel abroad,” the petition states.

The NGO has sought an interim order directing the state government to estimate the actual amount recoverable from mining companies.

The petition also seeks direction to the chief secretary to ascertain the circumstances in which mining operations were permitted in the absence of valid environmental clearances (ECs) and submit a report to the court.

The Goa Foundation petition states that all the ECs were not valid beyond 2010 or 2011, apart from the fact that many of these ECs had no validity from 2007.

“The mining companies and the authorities were aware that they did not have valid ECs when they re-commenced and carried out mining in the state after their leases were renewed post the Supreme Court judgment. So the companies could not have carried out extraction, mining and sale of ore from 2015 to 2018, even if they had a renewed lease. Neither could the authorities have permitted them to do so,” the NGO said.

Goa Foundation said the recovery amount is based on the payment of royalty at 15% and also takes into consideration payments made under different heads, including the District Mineral Foundation and the Goa Iron Ore Permanent Fund.

113,['1/02/2020'],"More you honk, the longer you wait! Signal to stay red if decibel level high","Honking causes noise pollution and has an adverse effect on health.

Horn not okay, please! Find out how the @MumbaiPolice hit the mute button on #Mumbai’s reckless honkers.… https://t.co/yJn4tf7d4U — Mumbai Police (@MumbaiPolice) 1580442358000

MUMBAI: The city traffic police have conducted trials of what could be a solution to the menace of needless honking—a punishing signal.Special decibel meters were connected to traffic signals at five locations and when noise exceeding 85dB was recorded, the signal timer would reset itself.This forced motorists to wait longer at the signal by “punishing” them for their impatience and teaching them to not honk the next time. A video clip of the experiment tweeted by Mumbai police ’s Twitter handle on Friday got 22,000 likes and was retweeted over 9,000 times.Honking causes noise pollution and has an adverse effect on health.“The trials were carried out for a few hours in November and December 2019. We selected locations that are most prone to congestion such as CSMT, Marine Drive, Pedder Road, Hindmata and Bandra Turner Road. In future, we will implement this at more signals,” said joint commissioner, traffic, Madhukar Pandey.He further said there could be congestion on some stretches as a result, but this would be managed by deploying additional forces.The video, made in partnership with private agency FCB Interface, gives glimpses of confused motorists who wait at a signal, honk continuously and learn it the hard way that honking is not the way out.Anti-noise activist Sumaira Abdulali commended the police for acting on on their own. “I hope the decibel meters will be put up permanently so that people become aware of the unacceptably high levels of noise from honking. At the same time, we have been demanding an enforcement campaign against honking, on the lines of the police’s helmet campaign, for a very long time. We hope that alongside the awareness created by decibel meters, they will take up an enforcement campaign which will continue over a sufficient period of time so that honking levels drop to within permissible limits,” said Abdulali.An RTI plea made by a media professional had revealed that only 1,293 motorists were booked for needless honking between January 2009 and September 2019. Deputy inspector general Harish Baijal, who was formerly with the traffic department, said, “We had the first ‘No Honking Day’ on April 7, 2008, and put up balloons and banners at Marine Drive, Bandra and Mahim Causeway and challaned 16,000 people. To drive home the point, I had challaned my own driver. After that, there was no major action taken by the traffic department and this video clip is really refreshing and reassuring,” said Baijal.Transport expert Hussain Indorewala has his doubts about the project though. One, said Indorewala, is how effective will it be in changing behaviour? It is likely that people will figure it out quickly and avoid honking where such a system is installed, but continue the practice where it isn’t. “People generally do not alter behaviour when they perceive they are being ‘tricked’ into doing things. So it may not work to alter social behavior, but simply make people smarter than the system,” he said. Two, added Indorewala, it seems Mumbai police is attacking a symptom, not the cause. Private transport on India’s precarious roads is an extremely stressful activity and forces people into sloppy behaviour, one of which is excessive honking, he said. “These kind of smart devices shift the burden of responsibility from public policy to individuals, and sidestep the more serious problem of traffic congestion by attacking traffic noise. Why not reduce stress by introducing traffic management instead?” he suggested. Three, he said, “such clever techno-fixes tend to create unanticipated problems. What happens if there is a fire truck or ambulance wanting to pass? A silencer gone bad? A Diwali night? Or what happens when some people deliberately create a din to arrest traffic?”Robby Mathew, chief creative officer, FCB Interface, said, “Sometimes, the stick works better than the carrot. And a signal that gave us a gentle rap on the knuckles for honking unnecessarily, seemed like a good idea to me”.",mumbai,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73829667,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-639087,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/more-you-honk-the-longer-you-wait-signal-to-stay-red-if-decibel-level-high/articleshow/73819813.cms

Representative image

KOLKATA: Almost seven months after two cops were arrested for masterminding a robbery in the Muchipara area, a detective department constable — Pranoy Roy of the dog squad — was arrested on Thursday for masterminding a similar gold heist in Chitpore . The incident took place in November last year.

Police said Roy had asked four of his associates — Shantanu Karar, Chandan Raut and Monojit Mondal from Howrah and Sk Akram from East Burdwan — to commit the November heist, posing as income tax officers. “We arrested Roy’s associates three days ago. We wanted to know why they chose Kolkata and learnt about the role of Roy. He was very much present near the crime spot,” said DC (North) Joyeeta Bose.

According to police, the November 11 incident took place when Chitpore jewellery shop employee Sk Hasibul Ali was returning to his shop with around 300 gm gold worth Rs 12 lakh. “It was evening and the five men identified themselves as I-T officials. They took away the gold and his mobile. Ali reported the matter to Chitpore police,” said an officer from north division. Sources said Roy might be part of an inter-state gang. “He will face a departmental inquiry too,” said an officer.

Cops said the accused were caught after the gang tried to use the same modus operandi to rob another jeweller near the same area on January 26. The cops said this time they had targeted 400 gm of gold worth Rs 16 lakh. “The CCTV footage matched and we managed to nab the accused,” an officer said.

Bose said the accused is now in police custody. Officers at Lalbazar said this was the third instance in a year that a cop from Kolkata and its surrounding commissionarates have been arrested for committing a serious crime.

MANGALURU: The Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP), Bajarang Dal and Durga Vahini will offer help to acid attack victim Swapna.

Vidyananda Saraswati, seer of Mathashree Shivajyana Mayi, Om Shri Mutt, said on Friday, “We are planning to help acid attack victims financially, and will donate Rs 1 lakh to them. Apart from it, we will also make plans to collect funds for medical expenses and rehabilitation of the family,” he said, adding that the VHP, Bajrang Dal and Durga Vahini condemn such acid attacks.

Swapna, in her complaint to superintendent of police B M Laxmi Prasad on January 27 had stated that her brother-in-law Jayanand was exhibiting lecherous behaviour whenever he visited her house on some or the other pretext. She has also stated that she had complained about this to the women’s police station at Puttur.

Vidyananda Saraswati alleged that after the death of Swapna’s husband, accused Jayanand was trying to exploit the victim sexually. However, she was facing all of it bravely. “Swapna had to keep silent since she had no support from anyone. On the day of the attack, Jayanand tried to kill her by using a sickle, but she managed to escape and locked herself inside the house. When she went inside, he opened a bottle of acid used for making rubber sheets, and threw it inside the house. The acid fell on Swapna and also her daughter, who has sustained minor injuries,” he explained. Swapna has received burns on her face and chest and lost an eye, while her daughter has sustained minor injuries on her legs and hands.

Surekha Raj, district vice-secretary of VHP, demanded that the case be tried in a fast-track court, and the government must sanction compensation to Swapna. After her husband Ravi’s death two years ago, she was taking care of her family.

BICHOLIM: The three mining firms operating in Shirgao have refused to pay pending water bills of the villagers.

A meeting was held on Friday between villagers and officials of the mining companies at the office of Bicholim deputy collector. Locals claimed that water bills of 371 houses, amounting to Rs 20 lakh, have been pending since March 2018.

The officials, however, said that since their respective companies were already contributing to the district mineral fund, it would not be possible for them to pay off the water bills of the villagers too. This refusal resulted in a tense situation.

Later on Friday evening, the villagers convened a meeting during which they decided to continue their agitation until the water bills are paid. “We will continue to agitate until we get justice,” Shirgao sarpanch Sadanand Gaonkar, said.

Thiruvananthapuram: The benefits that may trickle down to Kerala from Bharat Net programme for which the Union finance minister has set apart Rs 6,000 crore in the latest budget may be insignificant if not nil, at least during the current fiscal.

The Rs 6,000 allocation the Union finance minister announced in her budget proposes to ensure internet connectivity to 1 lakh more gram panchayaths in the country. Bharat Net, an ongoing programme, has till date not benefitted Kerala as the state has already established internet connectivity when the programme was rolled out in 2017.

The state government, however, is in constant talks with the Centre with the demand that the state should not be denied the central assistance for establishing broadband internet connectivity because it already has achieved the objective. “We are in talks with the Centre and we have been promised that Kerala would be considered for the allocation once the basic objective of establishing connectivity in panchayats across the country is established. We made the request for assistance to our KFON project through which we plan to establish high speed internet connectivity all across the state at an affordable pricing. We don’t know how much assistance we may get and when we would be getting the same,” IT secretary M Sivasankar said.

Bharat Broadband Network (BBNL), touted as the largest rural broadband project under the Ministry of IT and Telecommunications, is the agency assigned for establishing the broadband network in rural areas. In Kerala, BBNL established the broadband connectivity in gram panchayat level with the assistance of BSNL. However, BBNL later chose a private partner over BSNL for the operation and maintenance of its broadband service.

up

Bhopal: In an attempt at image makeover, Barkatullah University has decided to make a documentary about the facilities and history of the varsity. Madhyam will make the documentary, which is likely to be released by March.

For the past few years, the university has witnessed several controversies. According to officials, as the university is desperate to upgrade its grade in NAAC, there was a need to use both audio and visual media.

Asked about the need for a documentary, registrar Bharti said, “After joining the university, I was surprised to see that there is nothing in the university to depict our image in the public. On several occasions, it was embarrassing for us whenever they asked us to share any video or audio highlighting about the university campus.”

“BU has been an important campus in the state capital and has produced several talents. However, its image was also tarnished on several occasions in the past. Our attempt is to tell the youths that they can make a good career by studying in the university,” said registrar Bharti. The executive council has given the green signal to registrar in this regard.

About the documentary, Bharti said Rs 8 lakh will be given to Madhyam. “As I wanted full transparency, it was better for us to ask Madhyam for making the documentary. It will be a 10-minute documentary, focusing on the university’s achievements,” said Bharti.

Madhyam was created as a platform, on which communication needs of the government of Madhya Pradesh and its various departments and agencies could be fulfilled with a high degree of professionalism and freedom of creativity. Data has been collected from different BU departments for making the documentary. “The documentary will show the available infrastructure, students, teachers, employees and achievements. I have directed the departments of the university to provide authentic and true data for the documentary. We will also try to use small clips of our students, teachers as well as players who study here and play at the national and international level,” said Bharti.

126,['1/02/2020'],"Delhi’s Naidu gang member killed, another hurt in infighting","This story is from February 1, 2020

Meerut: Honey, a member of Delhi-based Naidu gang, was killed while another member Tilak Raj was shot at in what is seen as a fallout within the gang, largely owing to internal rivalry.

According to police, the incident occurred on Khirwa road under Kankerkhera police station in Meerut on Thursday night when onlookers alerted police over shootout involving occupants in a car.

As per the preliminary interrogation, it is revealed that Shiv Shakti Naidu, one of Delhi’s most notorious gangsters and kingpin of Naidu gang, and others opened fire at Honey and Tilak and later fled from the spot. Honey who succumbed at the spot had sustained five bullet wounds while Tilak is currently in a critical condition with four bullet injuries.

A local property dealer Rituraj has also come under the scanner. “He (Rituraj) was detained on Friday evening and a thorough interrogation is underway to establish the motive behind the shootout to get to the bottom of the case,” said Meerut SP City Akhilesh Narayan Singh. It was learnt from the local sleuths that a meeting was held at a flat in Kankerkhera area on Thursday evening and later they went towards the highway where the shootout took place.

“When the police reached the spot, they found a man lying dead on the driver’s seat while another victim who had sustained four bullet injuries was also lying close by. A pistol and several cartridges were also recovered from the car’s back seat,” Meerut SSP Ajay Sahni said. The injured was identified as criminal Tilak Raj while the deceased was identified as Tilak’s nephew Honey, according to cops.

Meanwhile, according to senior police officials, the gang was planning to assassinate a senior Delhi cop who had slapped stringent Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act (MCOCA) on Shakti Naidu and others following a Rs 7.8 crore dacoity in Delhi’s Lajpat Nagar in 2014.

“Tilak during interrogation claimed that Naidu and others were planning to assassinate a senior Delhi cop of the rank of additional commissioner of police. Naidu allegedly went berserk after Tilak and his nephew Honey refused to be part of the assassination plan,” a source close to TOI in the department said.

Shakti Naidu, who was out on bail, had come to limelight following the Lajpat Nagar dacoity and is considered one of the most notorious gangsters in Delhi. In November 2017, three members of the gang, including two of Naidu’s relatives, were arrested from south Delhi.

127,['1/02/2020'],"After 570 deaths last year, Allahabad police to do road accident analysis of each case","This story is from February 1, 2020

Representative image

ALLAHABAD: In the light of 570 deaths in over 1,300 cases of road accidents last year in the district, traffic police authorities have taken up a Post Accident Analysis (PAA) exercise of every road accident reported in the city, Trans Ganga and Trans Yamuna pockets of the district.

As many as 570 people lost their lives and 913 others were injured in 1,365 road accidents in the city in 2019.

Allahabad SSP Satyarth Anirudh Pankaj told TOI, “A team of traffic police officials have launched Post Accident Analysis exercise of each road accident case separately to find out the exact reason behind them.”

“The exercise has been launched in both rural and urban areas of the district. The team will then prepare a detailed chart listing the reason behind road accidents in fatal and non-fatal categories. A list of accident prone areas (black spots) will also be included,” he added.

“Once the final report arrives, the decision on the status of black spots will be reviewed accordingly. The PAA report will be out by the end of February,” said the SSP.

In the exercise, the road accidents cases will be categorized based on various factors including over speeding, rash driving, road structure design, forced entry into no entry zones, wrong side driving and tipsy driving.

As per the data released by Allahabad police last year, around 63% of fatal and non-fatal road accidents recorded were attributed to rash driving and violation of speed limits.

The 2019 road accident statistics show that the highest number of road accident deaths were reported in June (71) followed by 68 in March, 59 in May, 56 in February, 47 in April, 44 in November, 43 in October, 42 in January, 38 in August, 35 in July, 33 in December and 30 in September.

The traffic police authorities had, in December last year, prescribed speed limits of heavy/commercial four and two-wheeler vehicles for 56 identified roads.

“We are making sincere efforts to arrest the graph of road accidents. Directives have also been issued to traffic cops to tighten noose around speed limit violators and rash drivers,” said the SSP.

129,['1/02/2020'],Yug killer also behind theft at Chandak clinic,"This story is from February 1, 2020

Nagpur: There is a fresh twist in the kidnapping and murder case of eight-year-old Yug Chandak , which would now be heard before the Supreme Court (SC) on February 11. One of the two convicts has been charged with burglary for allegedly tipping off a thief who had stolen valuables from the clinic of Yug’s parents at Darodkar Square.

The SC counsel for Maharashtra has now written to the Nagpur Central Jail and also Lakadganj police station seeking background and behaviour report of the two convicts Rajesh Daware and Arvind Singh who have appealed in the SC against their death sentence.

While Lakadganj police has already sent the report, prison officials are waiting for some formalities to get over before they can reply to the counsel’s mail.

The duo was held for kidnapping and murder of Yug, a Std II student, for ransom on September 1, 2014. Their death sentence was upheld by the Nagpur bench of Bombay high court in 2016.

It’s learnt, Daware and Singh were kept at the lock-up of Sadar police station after their arrest. In the custody, the two had met two burglars. Daware, the mastermind behind the kidnapping and murder, befriended one of the burglars and briefed him about the cash and other valuables kept at the clinic of Yug’s parents Dr Mukesh and Dr Premal.

Daware, a former employee of Yug’s father, was miffed with the dentist for having fired him from the job.

The burglar and his accomplice decamped with substantial valuables from the clinic in 2015. Though the burglars were arrested by Lakadganj police station, the then investigation officer did not mention about Daware’s role in the crime.

Last year, an additional supplementary charge sheet filed in the burglary case named Daware as one of the accused.

Meanwhile, when the kidnapping and murder case came up for hearing before the SC in 2018, the bench wanted report of the background and behaviour of the two appellants lodged in Nagpur Central jail. As the case is set to now come up again, the counsel for Maharashtra state has sought a similar kind of report in advance with latest updates.

130,['1/02/2020'],Parties concerned over Kerala cops’ partisan approach,"This story is from February 1, 2020

Kozhikode: Concerns have been raised from various corners over the perceived pro-Sangh Parivar attitude of the Kerala police in dealing with the developments after the introduction of the Citizenship (Amendment) Act ( CAA ). The allegation is that police are taking a partisan approach while dealing with a section of the community.

The latest example cited is the case registered against SDPI workers who protested when Sangh Parivar activists took out a march in Vadakara on Thursday. The Sangh Parivar staged a protest alleging that there was local support for the accused in the Kaliyikkavila case. Vadakara police registered cases against both the groups but Section of IPC 153 (wantonly giving provocation with intent to cause riot) was charged against SDPI workers.

Similarly, Mannuthy police registered a case against Welfare Party of India state secretary K Sajeed under Section 153 of IPC for a Facebook post against police. “My post was on the incident of a person named Babu attacking a middle-aged woman Jameela at Mullakkara in Thrissur, asking her to leave the country. In the post, I said police are trying to make the accused a mentally unstable person. Now, police have registered a case against me too,” Sajeed told TOI.

Thrissur police, however, said Babu has been charged with Sections 323, 341 and 354 of the IPC. A case was registered against Sajeed for posting a baseless comment that the accused had shouted at the woman to go to Pakistan. The accused was violent when he was brought to the police station and he was sent to mental health centre, police said.

“The government says one thing and police are moving in another direction. Pinarayi Vijayan and the CPM said they are against the UAPA, but police slapped the law on Allan Shuhaib and Twaha Fasal. There is something mysterious about the pro-Sangh Parivar attitude of the Kerala police,” said Musthafa Kommeri, secretary of the SDPI.

Ashwani Lohani

Vadodara: Air India has started to evacuate Indians from Wuhan, China on Friday. And if necessary another flight may depart on Saturday.

This is what chairman and managing director (CMD) of Air India Ashwani Lohani told media persons here. Lohani was in Vadodara to attend 69th foundation day ceremony of National Academy of Indian Railways (NAIR).

“We will evacuate Indians from Wuhan, the site of outbreak of coronavirus,” said Lohani, former chairman of Railway Board, who was conferred with the distinguished alumnus award during the ceremony. Professor Errol D’Souza, director of IIM-Ahmedabad, was the chief guest.

A special flight — double decker jumbo with 15 cabin crew and five cockpit crew — departed from Indira Gandhi International Airport, New Delhi for Wuhan for evacuation of Indians on Friday noon. The flight may return to New Delhi from Wuhan (China) on Saturday morning.

NAIR’s director general (DG) S P S Chauhan informed that the academy had received the prestigious 'Golden peacock nation training award’ in 2019. Lohani said the greatest resource of an organization- especially of Indian Railways- is its manpower. Recollecting his days as Railway Board chairman, he said he had banned bouquets and culture of gifts.

“I think that culture has started returning. It did not get deeply ingrained,” he said, stressing that all officers of Indian Railways are ‘servants of Indian people.’

Medals and awards were given away to 60 officers of different levels of seniority for their outstanding achievements in various fields and activities during training at NAIR. The DG medals for Group-A and foundation courses (2018 and 2019) went to Akshay Gangarwal and Rajeev Chaudhari, respectively. DG’s medals for Group- A and medical foundation (2018 and 2019) went to Dr Shivangi Shukla and Dr Asha Kalwar, respectively.

133,['1/02/2020'],Man murdered after brawl at liquor den on dry day,"This story is from February 1, 2020

Nagpur: A 27-year-old man was stabbed and thrashed to death following a brawl at a liquor den at Minimata Nagar in Kalamna on Thursday, which was declared dry day by the district administration on account of Mahatma Gandhi death anniversary.

The prime accused is brother of a woman with whom the victim, Roshan Chourasiya, allegedly had an illicit relationship.

Kalamna police, despite the arrest of the prime accused Raj Bharti, are under scanner as the crime took place at a notorious liquor den of bootlegger Meenabai. Sources in the locality said the den is known for making liquor available in black market, especially on dry days, in connivance with local policing network.

Kalamna police have refuted the allegations of liquor being available in the area on dry day.

The victim had an affair with Meenabai’s married daughter who is a mother of three. “Chourasiya and Bharti were at loggerheads over the victim’s relationship with Meenabai's daughter. They had got into scuffles during the last couple of days,” said a source close to Chourasiya.

Chourasiya was murdered when he was celebrating a friend’s birthday at the liquor den. Chourasiya had purchased liquor worth Rs1,500 at the den and was openly enjoying with music.

Chourasiya had left home with Rs2,000. “He had purchased each bottle for Rs250 from the den,” said Chourasiya’s friend.

Sources said that Chourasiya was seated with Meenabai’s daughter and trying to persuade her to leave her family when Bharti spotted them. Bharti and Chourasiya got into a heated argument, leading to a drunken brawl. Bharti's sister fled the spot when the murder took place. Her slippers were at the spot when police reached there, said sources.

Bharti, along with his friends Akash Mehta and others, thrashed Chourasiya to death before smashing his head with a boulder. Mehta is on the run.

It’s learnt Chourasiya too was allegedly involved in the murder of his friend-turned-foe Raja Ghantala at red light area of Ganga Jamuna in 2016. He was released from jail around a year ago. After release, he had been driving auto-rickshaw to earn livelihood.

Chourasiya’s elder brother Ajay too was externed twice in the past.

Zonal DCP Neelotpal said that he would look into the issue of availability of liquor on dry day.

Vijayawada: Very soon women in Andhra Pradesh can send a distress signal to the police just by shaking their mobile phone thanks to the technological advancements made by the state police. Apart from bringing Disha Act to ensure justice to rape victims within 21 days, the state government is also bringing in various preventive measures for women safety.

As part of the preventive safety measures, the state police have designed a state of the art mobile application with advanced features through which women can send a distress signal just by shaking their mobile phone. The feature that is available in Andriod and IOS smart phones will send an SOS to the control room with location coordinates, and a ten seconds video footage from the time the SOS call originated. The app was designed in such a way that the phone’s camera will activate and records the video and send it to command control centre so that cops to have an idea about the status of the victim.

The police have taken certain measures to avoid false signals. The shake trigger will activate only after shaking the phone five times. There is also an option of disabling video recording to avoid privacy issues. All control rooms across the state will be integrated with the Disha App and specially-trained personnel will be designated to deal with the complaints coming from Disha App.

A senior official who played a major role in designing the app said that the app is aimed to ensure safety of the women. In many cases, the victims may not get a chance to unlock their phone and call the police. “The shake trigger and video recording feature will ensure safety even without calling police directly. Our teams will be deployed based on the coordinates we receive even though we could not be able to talk to the victim directly,” the anonymous senior official said.

Apart from the shake trigger feature, cops have also included a feature in the mobile application to share a route map while travelling in private transport vehicles which will alert the police if the vehicle deviates from the route. Users can also access information about and phone numbers of nearest police stations, nearest hospitals and blood banks, in case of an emergency. The app, which is in advanced stages of testing, will be launched by chief minister YS Jaganmohan Reddy soon.

138,['1/02/2020'],Govt to build 22 new fishing harbours along the coast,"This story is from February 1, 2020

Amaravati: In a move to create better avenues for fishermen, the state government will build at least 22 new fishing harbours along the coast and develop the existing facilities.

The fisheries department has readied a blueprint for the development of fishing harbours. A study was conducted to identify locations to construct major and minor harbours.

In the first phase, four major harbours would be taken up and another four harbours in the second phase. Each harbor would be constructed at a cost of Rs 350 crore. The government is planning to secure 50% funds from the Centre as Andhra Pradesh is the highest producer of marine products giving massive revenue to the exchequer.

“The Centre is willing to help the state as increased avenues for fishermen is indirectly helping the Centre raking up huge revenue through export of marine products,” said fisheries minister Mopidevi Venkata Ramana.

He said that the Centre had responded to give Rs 100 crore for renovation of Visakhapatnam fishing harbour .

The construction of major harbours at Machilipatnam (Krishna), Vadarevu (Prakasam), Juvvaladinne (Nellore) and Uppada (East Godavari) would be taken up in the first phase during the current fiscal itself. The works on the remaining four major harbours one each at Kothapatnam (Prakasam) Pudimadaka (Visakhapatnam), Edduvanipalem (Srikakulam), Budagatlapalem (Srikakulam) would be taken up under second phase in the next fiscal.

The government had identified another 14 locations for construction of minor jettys to help fishermen increase the operations. “The CM has directed us to take up all measures required to improve infrastructure after fishermen were released from Pakistan and Bangladesh jails. The creation of more facilities would help fishermen to focus on their livelihood along the AP’s coast instead of going elsewhere,” said Ramana.

He said that the department was planning to encourage fishermen to go for cage-culture for providing better returns.

Employees of PSU banks protest at RBI Square (Pic by Ranjit Deshmukh)

Nagpur: More than 4,000 government bank employees took to the streets on Friday as part of two-day all-India strike seeking pay hike.

This was the second bank strike in a month, first being on January 8.

With the agitation scheduled to continue on Saturday also, transactions worth more than Rs6,000 crore in all PSU banks’ branches in Vidarbha are expected to be hit, say union sources.

Even as there have been independent estimates of 4,000 employees taking part in the protest rally, bank unions have claimed that nearly 7,000 were present.

“Before this, a strike against government’s economic policies was observed on January 8. However, the crowd that gathered on Friday was unprecedented,” said Jaiwant Gurway, general secretary of Eastern Maharashtra Bank Employees Association (EMBEA).

The strike has been called to press for a 20% hike in the payslip components. The unions are also demanding hike in family pension, defined working hours for offices and equal wage for equal work to contract workers apart from five-day week etc. The unions say that wage revision is due since 2017. As against the demand of 20% hike, the Indian Banks Association (IBA), which represents management, has offered increase at 12.5%.

According to union sources, cheques worth Rs2,800 crore on an average are cleared in a day in all PSU bank branches in Vidarbha. Apart from it, bills worth Rs500 crore are also discounted. All the functions had come to a standstill due to the strike on Friday and work will be hit on Saturday too.

Unions in State Bank of India (SBI) generally remain away from the strike calls. However, this time even the SBI unions have joined the agitation leading to a major impact on banking business, said sources.

140,['1/02/2020'],Industries wants sops to revive economy,"This story is from February 1, 2020

Nagpur: Industries of the region want a variety of sops to grow at a good rate and help revive the economy. Local industry captains have pegged a lot of hope on the 2020-21 Union Budget.

Nitin Lonkar, president of Butibori Manufacturers Association (BMA), said that more funds should be made available to micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs). “Banks do not entertain MSMEs. They should be set a target for lending to this sector. Moreover, the interest rate for the sector should be reduced,” he added.

According to Lonkar, ease of doing business should be improved for the sector, and the ambit of government e-marketplace (GeM) portal should be increased, so that MSMEs get a platform to market their products.

Chandrashekhar Shegaonkar, president of Hingna MIDC Industries Association (MIA), said that the rate of goods and services tax (GST) should be reduced and personal income tax (IT) exemption limit should be increased to Rs5 lakh.

“Agriculture should be given the status of an industry. Small farmers are often unable to manage their farms, so if industrialists are allowed to undertake corporate farming, corporates can buy their land and do farming profitably,” Shegaonkar added.

Suresh Rathi, president of Vidarbha Industries Association (VIA), said that he did not have much expectations from the budget, as the government did not have enough money after the slowdown in economy. “However, if the government invests Rs100 lakh crore on infrastructure, it will boost the economy. Personal IT should be reduced so that people have money in their hands. Exports should be stimulated,” Rathi said.

“Corporate dividend tax must go, if you want people to invest. Ease of doing business for industries should be real and tangible at the grassroots,” he added.

Madhusudan Rungta, president of Chandrapur MIDC Industries Association, said that IT exemption should be increased to Rs10 lakh. “Banks should do discounting for MSMEs if their payment is delayed. Agro-industries should be given 30% transport subsidy, so that units far away from big cities get a level playing field,” he added.

Umesh Malu, president of Akola Industries Association, said that all tax payment should be faceless, along the lines of IT; and that the rate of interest for MSMEs should be between 2% and 3%. “Countries like South Korea are able to export a lot of goods because their industries get very cheap loans. They agree to take payment three years later. We cannot do that,” he added.

Malu further said that there should a comprehensive audit for all taxes and compulsory payments like provident fund. “I should not be required to go to the chartered accountant ten times a year for different compliances. They should need to do it only once for all departments,” he added.

SALIGAO: Aggrieved stakeholders and depositors of Mapusa Urban Cooperative Bank (MUCB) across all branches will hold a peaceful protest in front of the bank’s headquarters at Mapusa on February 3.

In a press release, the stakeholders have stated that the meeting to be held from 10.30am to 12.30pm, “is to express the unwarranted grief and misery imposed on them due to the financial irregularities and mismanagement by the board of directors that led to Reserve Bank of India (RBI) imposing sanctions on the bank’s operations”.

MUCB needs around Rs 50 crore as share capital infusion in order to come out of RBI’s financial sanctions that end on February 18, or else the bank faces liquidation.

“Unlike the Punjab and Maharashtra Cooperative Bank case, it is incomprehensible to the depositors why RBI has delayed to initiate similar criminal investigations for financial fraud against the MUCB’s board of directors. These unwarranted hardships are forced upon the depositors, depriving them of their funds due to mismanagement by the board. The depositors, comprising senior citizens, small-time traders, entrepreneurs, teachers, etc, are in urgent need of their hard-earned money due to various personal exigencies,” the stakeholders stated.

BHOPAL: After the Governor of Kerala Arif Mohammad Khan , Madhya Pradesh Governor Lalji Tandon too stated that Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) cannot be stopped from implementation by the state government, thereby fueling speculations of a conflict-like situation with the Kamal Nath government if it decides not to implement the new law.

“There is a Laxman-rekha (restriction) in the Constitution for state governments,” he said speaking to reporters during the inauguration of the new media room in the Raj Bhawan here on Friday.

“Any Bill passed by the Lok Sabha , Rajya Sabha and thereafter, with the assent of the President becomes a law. So, which state in the country can deny implementing it?” the Governor asked.

There are ten states including MP that have refused to implement the law including West Bengal , Punjab, Maharashtra, Kerala. On December 25, chief minister Kamal Nath told the media, “So long as Congress is running the government in Madhya Pradesh, no anti-Constitution, anti-people and anti-religion law will be implemented here.”

Addressing a public meeting recently, the chief minister had said, “Our country’s identity is our culture to unite in diversity. The attack today is not just on our Constitution but on the rights of every citizen. Our patriarchs like Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar framed the Constitution to unite the diversity and multiplicity of our nation under one flag. Today, that has been attacked. The kind of law that has been passed endangers our rights and the future. Let us all raise our voices to protest it.”

Speaking about the role of the Governors in case of conflict with the state government on the issue, Tandon said, “After taking over the office of Governor, one is committed to work within the provisions of the Constitution, no matter which political background he comes from. A Governor works according to the Constitution.”

When asked, what he appreciates most about the Congress government in the state, the Governor said chief minister Kamal Nath is upholding the “Sanatan culture” and I like him for that. He welcomed the state government’s decision to construct the Ram Van Gaman Path from Chitrakoot, the grand Sita temple in Sri Lanka and the recitation of the Hanuman Chalisa on Mahatma Gandhi death anniversary.

Meanwhile, state Congress spokesman Narendra Saluja took a dig at the BJP. He tweeted, “Today His Excellency the Governor praised the state government’s decisions taken for welfare of the people in the past one year and the construction of Ram Van Gaman Path, Sita Mata temple and recital of Hanuman Chalisa. Don’t know when BJP’s good sense will prevail.”

Nagpur: The beauty of painted faces and amazing postures in performing Kathakali dance takes everyone’s breath away, but what goes behind to put this act together is the script and story selected from mythology.

People, especially non-Malayalis, often fail to understand the essence of these stories since it is narrated in Malayalam. Now, here is an opportunity for all Kathakali lovers to understand the story as the songs will be accompanied by Hindi and English commentary.

Kathakali dance drama ‘Narakasuravadham (the death of Narakasura)’ will be performed at 7pm on Sunday as part of the ongoing three-day All-India Classical Dance Competition and Festival being held at Sai Sabhagruh.

Janardhanan Nair of Pratibha Natya Mandir believes the commentary will attract all dance lovers. “The narration is always in Malayalam. As Nagpur is a multi-lingual city, we wanted people to understand the storyline so that they could enjoy the performance to the fullest,” he said.

Manish Nair, who will be doing the commentary, said,“Kathakali reflects Malayalam culture. Hence, we decided to use Hindi and English to make the performance more people friendly. The story of Narakasura will sure be liked by Kathakali lovers,” he said.

The act will be performed by Kalamamdalam Adthiyan and troupe from Kerala. The story of Narakasuravadham revolves around demon king Narakasura who deputes Nakrathundi to capture damsels from heaven. The demoness travels to heaven, nabs a few and starts her return journey.

“On her way, Nakrathundi meets young and handsome Jayantha, son of Indra. Attracted to him, the demoness approaches Jayantha in the guise of beautiful Lalitha. She reveals her longing for Jayantha, but he turns down her proposal for marriage,” said Manish, explaining the story.

A disappointed Lalitha then turns into ferocious Nakrathundi and tries to abduct Jayantha. In the tussle that follows, Jayantha mutilates Nakrathundi by cutting off her ears, nose and breasts. The rest of the story is about the revenge of Narakasura who defeats Indra, but is later killed by Lord Krishna.

“The performers are on their way to present their art in all its glory. However, the songs will be in Malayali,” said Rajan Nambiar, president of NSS.

Diwali sybolizes the victory of Lord Krishna over Narkasura--good over evil.

ALLAHABAD: A day before the presentation of the Union budget on Saturday, the all India Kisan Majdoor Sangh (AIKMS) has demanded reduction in input prices of agriculture , diesel, seeds, fertilizers, insecticides and electricity by half. While input costs have risen by 33 to 100 % in last five years, the cost of living has more than doubled, said AIKMS .

General secretary, AIKMS, said that input support through PMKISAN at Rs 6,000 per year is too meagre and should be raised to Rs 6,000 per acre per crop. Budgetary support is required to pay a profitable minimal support price (MSP) of 1.5 times the cost of production for all crops and assured government procurement of all crops. In the last one year, distress sale of vegetables, pulses, oilseeds, wheat, rice, millets, milk, sugarcane, cotton caused huge losses and debs to peasants.

Budget should allot adequate funds for debt waiver. “The government has waived more than 2 lakh crores of bad debts of corporate and given them an additional tax concession of Rs 1.45 lakh crore. It should announce freedom from debt for all peasants including agricultural workers and including their private loans,” said Mittal.

AIKMS has also demanded that crop aggregation and marketing should be done through the government allocation of funds for building storage houses, cold storages, procurement, food processing facility which can be rented by farmers.

Wind direction and cloud cover are key factors for the drop in mercury

PANAJI: The mercury dropped to 20.1C on Friday morning as the pleasant chill was felt once again after some warm nights in an erratic winter season marked by higher minimum temperatures .

However, while the weather is likely to get even cooler, it may not remain constant for long. “We are not expecting it to go beyond 19C. But after February 2, the minimum temperature may start rising again,” Rahul M, scientist at the India meteorological department (IMD), Panaji, said.

December last year witnessed the warmest nights since the 1970s as the mercury did not drop below 21C even once. As the month is regarded to be the peak period of the mild winter season, temperatures below 20C were usually recorded by the meteorological department quite often in the past. December 2019, however, logged minimum temperatures of 24C on eight days and 23C on seven days.

In contrast, January 17, 2020, recorded a minimum temperature of 18.3C — the lowest of the season. But the mild chill was short-lived as minimum temperatures soon began rising due to overcast conditions and change of wind directions.

Earlier this week, the mercury even rose to 24C, while clear skies during the day triggered a rise in maximum temperature. In fact, IMD, Panaji recorded temperatures of over 35C on a couple of days.

Wind direction and cloud cover are key factors for the drop in mercury. While northeasterly winds bring in the chill from northern regions, easterly winds are warm.

CM performs a ritual in the Ganga in Kanpur on Friday

KANPUR: The two Ganga yatras, which began from Bijnor and Ballia, culminated at Atal Ghat of Ganga in the city on Friday.

Chief minister Yogi Adityanath and his cabinet ministers welcomed the members of two yatras. They first took part in the ‘Aarti’ and later worshipped Ganga amid chanting of Vedic ‘mantras’.

Addressing a gathering, the CM said that residents of Kanpur knew that the city used to be the most critical point of Namami Gange Mission.

“Things have changed now. Earlier, aquatic life in Jajmau was in danger and could not survive but now they are breeding successfully. The Namami Gange Mission has made the river clean and clear. People are now taking a dip in the river”, Yogi said.

He said the two teams during the 1,338 km long five-day yatra have done many constructive works. He has appealed to the inhabitants of the Ganga bank not to use chemical to maintain the cleanliness of the river. He asked them to take a pledge to ensure the river’s cleanliness and its continuous flow.

Speaking on the occasion, deputy chief minister Keshav Prasad Maurya said that the Prime Minister and the chief minister, who had pledged to make the river clean, have achieved success up to some extent in their mission. Around 24.56 crore devotees had taken a dip in Ganga on the occasion of Kumbh 2019 and more than 48 crores are expected to take a dip in 2025 Kumbh, he said.

Jal shakti minister Mahendra Singh said Ganga was brought on the earth by Bhagirath and now two ‘Bhagiraths’ were trying to make it clean. State BJP president Swatantra Dev Singh said, “All of us should pledge to make Ganga clean and pollution-free.”

An empty office at a bank in Bhopal on Friday

Bhopal: Banking operations were completely paralyzed on Friday, the first day of the two-day nationwide strike of bank personnel. Even the locks could not be opened in a majority of about 4,500 bank branches in Madhya Pradesh.

Bank business worth several thousand crore was affected by the strike, that was called by the United Forum of Bank Unions (UFBU), an umbrella organisation of nine unions of bank employees and officials. These unions cover almost all the major banks, including some private banks.

The nationwide strike will also cost the baInk personnel dear as their two-day salary would be deducted. “It would collectively amount to be about Rs 300 crore in the two days,” a bank union leader said.

Spokesman of the UFBU in Bhopal, Gunshekharan, said, “If the issues of the bank personnel are not resolved, more such strikes will happen in the coming days.”

For the past 26 months, bank unions have been negotiating with the India Bank Association (IBA) to resolve their issues related to salary, pension and working days. They also want IBA to define the working hours of bank officials.

“Nothing has been done so far to resolve the long pending issues,” Gunshekharan said.

People were inconvenienced on the first day of the strike as they were not able to operate lockers or carry out NEFT operations. Cash deposits and withdrawals were also not done. Operations related to foreign currency and bank loans were also affected completely. People may also face cash crunch in the next two days as ATMs will also not be replenished and in case of any technical snag in the machines, there would be no back support of the banks because of the strike, a bank union leader said.

After the strike, banks will open on February 2.

If the deadlock continues, the bank personnel have proposed another strike on March 11, 12 and 13. “Effectively, the banks will be closed for six days. The proposed three-day strike will be preceded by Holi on March 10 and followed by second Saturday and Sunday on March 14 and 15.”

Whistle-blower bureaucrat Sanjiv Chaturvedi (File photo)

NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Friday agreed to hear a plea by whistle-blower bureaucrat Sanjiv Chaturvedi seeking disclosure, under the RTI Act, about corruption complaints received and action taken by the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) against Union ministers between 2014-17.

A bench comprising justices L Nageswara Rao and Hemant Gupta issued a notice to the central public information officer (CPIO) of the PMO and sought a response. Chaturvedi, a Magsaysay award winner, approached the apex court after his plea for disclosure of the information was rejected by the Delhi high court on September 6.

Chaturvedi, in his RTI application filed with the PMO in 2017, had sought details of corruption complaints against Union ministers, inquiries conducted into complaints and action taken against them. He had also sought information on the amount of black money brought from abroad which were illegally parked there by the influential and rich people of the country.

He said the high court order strikes at the very root of democratic rights of a citizen to know about transactions/ businesses being carried out in the government, and more specifically in this case about status of action taken on corruption complaints of its own elected representatives, and promises made during elections regarding black money.

TRICHY: Onion farmers from Thuraiyur, Mannachanallur and Uppiliapuram are demanding compensation from the government as pests have damaged their crop raised on hundreds of acres, at the grievance day meeting held at the collectorate here on Friday. A section of farmers have also urged the government to ban Andhra Ponni paddy seed as their crop have been affected by pest and rice blast disease.

They have appealed the officials to commence enumeration of farmers who have been affected and staged a protest by bringing the damaged crops on their head.

Speaking at the meeting, Tamilaga Vivasayigal Sangam (affiliated to CPM) state secretary R Raja Chidambaram said that 5,000 acres of onion crop was completely damaged due to downy mildew pest. “Farmers had spent Rs 50,000 to raise the crop per acre.”

“Considering shortage of water, farmers usually cultivate short duration onion crops. The cold storage facility established at Chetticulam in Perambalur has failed to yield benefits but the facility in Tuticorin is functioning well. Agriculture department should construct such cold storage to help onion farmers,” he added.

“Following downy mildew pest which was caused by fungus-like organism Peronospora destructor, the pest first damages the leaves and later the bulbs of small onions. As the weather was humid in November 2019, 80% of small onion cultivated in Thuraiyur, Uppiliyapuram, Mannachanallur and Pullambadi blocks in Trichy district and major areas in Perambalur district were infected by the downy mildew infection. Incessant rains was also stated to be the reason for the crop loss,” agriculture officials said while replying to farmers.

District collector S Sivarasu has assured to commence the enumeration of crop loss and assured to recommend compensation to the affected farmers.

The farmers’ wing of Tamil Manila Congress brought damaged crop of Andhra Ponni paddy and showed it to the collector. “Farmers who raised Andhra Ponni (BPT 5204) lost their crop due to pest and rice blast disease attack this year.

Vijayawada: Andhra Pradesh will be hosting the third edition of Aquaex India 2020—which showcases Indian fisheries and aquaculture growth—from February 6 to 8, at Peda Amiram area of Bhimavaram mandal in West Godavari district on Friday.

The event is touted to be South Asia’s largest aqua conclave, with over 25,000 people set to participate in the the three-day event which will see leading exhibitors from the fishery and aquaculture industries from across the world showcase their expertise.

Announcing the objective behind Aquaex India 2020, founder of Aquaex Venu Dantuluri said: “As the appetite for seafood is growing globally, our idea is to create a global platform for Indian fisheries and aquaculture by bringing the latest technologies, services, equipment and machinery across the globe for their benefit.”

“Through this expo we want to showcase Andhra Pradesh fishery’s trade potential and open the doors to thousands of seafood professionals from around the globe seeking to grow their businesses in the Indian fisheries market.

Representative image

TRICHY: As finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman prepares to present the Union budget in Parliament on Saturday, railway associations are hoping that there will be announcements on infrastructure development in the delta districts. The establishment of a railway production unit and coach maintenance facility in Kumbakonam and a MEMU shed at Mayiladuthurai in Trichy railway division are some of the expectations.

The provision for establishing the unit in Tirunageswaram near Kumbakonam utilizing the 40 acres of vacant railway land will provide many direct and indirect employment opportunities and improve the economic condition of this agrarian region. Railways has many production units to make coaches, wagons, wheels, concrete sleepers etc, apart from reconditioning workshops, advisor of Thanjavur District Rail Users Association, A Giri said.

“Unlike other divisions in Southern Railway , coach maintenance facility exists only in Trichy division at Trichy and Villupuram. There is a long-pending demand for a coach maintenance facility in the 144-year-old Thanjavur-Villupuram mainline section,” he said.

A MEMU (mainline electric multiple unit) shed at Mayiladuthurai will enable the operation of such trains in lieu of presently operated conventional passenger or DEMU trains, he said. “Mayiladuthurai which is centrally located in Trichy division and having adequate land space will be the ideal place to establish a MEMU shed to serve the entire division.”

“Villupuram - Thanjavur - Trichy section is highly passenger oriented and has many important tourist and pilgrimage centres. As one of the important sections in Southern Railway, doubling of Thanjavur - Villupuram section (193km) with necessary fund allocation in the budgetary proposals of 2020-21 must be announced,” Giri said.

Meanwhile, deputy general secretary of Dakshin Railway Employees Union (DREU) D Manoharan said that Rs 20,000 crore annual fund for railway safety should be allotted from the exchequer instead of the existing practice of allotment from internal resources. After the budget merger, dividends of railway public sectors go to the exchequer. It should be credited into the railway account, he insisted.

“For employees, income tax ceiling should be raised to Rs 15 lakh and the standard deduction should be Rs 5 lakh. The fund should be allocated to execute staff welfare programmes like a hostel for railway employees’ children in major cities, construction of crèches at 20 divisional offices as announced in previous budgets,” Manoharan said.

10 Jan 2005 --- Gavel at board meeting --- Image by © Bruno Ehrs/Corbis

Bhopal/Jabalpur: A division bench of MP High Court on Friday allowed the MP Public Service Commission (MPPSC) to continue with the process of selection and recruitment of candidates, stating the final result would be subject to court’s order on petitions challenging hike in OBC quota to 27% from 14%.

A day after the same bench asked MPPSC to retain OBC quota at 14% for recruitment of 400 posts of civil servants in place of 27% as provided in the amended Act on provision of OBC quota in the state, advocate general, Shahashank Shekhar, had filed an application before the court seeking modification in its order in response to petitions challenging 27% reservation for OBCs in medical college admissions passed on March 19, 2019, through which the court had stayed 13% hike in reservation for OBCs, thereby taking the OBC quota to 27%.

It was based on this interim order that civil service aspirants had sought a similar order for MPPSC exams, which the court allowed.

Shekhar, however, in his application on Wednesday had contended that the petitioners in the case have challenged the validity of the amendment Act 2019 by which reservation to the OBC category has been increased from 14% to 27% and the court’s interim order was contrary to settled principle of law that operation of a piece of legislation during pendency of challenge to its validity can’t be stayed but can only be set aside and declared ultra vires.

He had urged the court to allow the application and modify the interim order of March 19, 2019 “in the interest of justice”.

Hearing the application on Friday, the division bench of Chief Justice A K Mittal and Justice V K Shukla didn’t modify its previous order as prayed by the state government, but passed another order allowing the PSC to proceed with recruitment process subject to condition that final selection list would only be declared after the court order on petitions challenging 27 % reservation for OBCs in place of 14 % as existed earlier.

In their brief order, the judges said “Counsel for the petitioners didn’t have any objection to the continuation of the selection process, but urged that it should be subject to final outcome in the writ petition and no final list be published without the prior permission of this court. Accordingly, it is directed that it shall be open for the PSC to go ahead with the selection process. However, the same will not be finalized and no appointments shall be made without the prior permission of the high court”.

158,['1/02/2020'],Gujarat: Man’s shoulder dislocated 30 times fixed with 3D surgery,"This story is from February 1, 2020

Doctors at GMERS Hospital in Gotri perform the complex surgery

VADODARA: A dislocated shoulder proved to be a real pain for 24-year-old Arjun Mali, who not only had to endure physical discomfort, but also had to lose his job owing to the recurring problem.

In the last seven years, Mali had to face shoulder dislocation at least 30 times.

However, that is history after Mali underwent a complex surgery at GMERS Hospital at Gotri to fix his problem.

According to doctors, a 3D model of the shoulder was prepared to identify the exact defect.

It is for the first time that 3D technology was used in a government hospital in Gujarat to treat a patient with such a peculiar condition.

“We had tried to reduce the relocated shoulder. But in rare conditions, the dislocation of shoulder continues for long. This patient too had to face it multiple times,” said Dr Tejas Chovatiya , senior resident at GMERS Gotri Hospital.

The doctors made a 3D model of shoulder bones. “Through this, we could learn the dynamics of dislocation and where exactly the defect lay – in the socket and the ball of the shoulder. We could also ascertain whether we should opt for soft tissue repair or go for bone graft transfer,” he said.

Using 3D model, the doctors identified that there was bone loss of nearly 20% in Mali’s socket and another 10% bone loss in the ball of the shoulder.

“We then decided bone transfer surgery through which we took another bone (coracoid bone) from the same shoulder and transferred it to the defective socket. We also saw everything through arthroscopy right from the beginning of the surgery,” said Chovatiya, who performed the main surgery with the support of Dr Smit Shah and Dr Rakesh Srivastava.

In private hospitals, such a surgery costs anywhere around Rs 2 lakh whereas at Gotri Mali had to spend less than Rs 10,000.

BHOPAL: With boards just a month away, students are seeking the help of counsellors to sort out exam stress related issues.

Since January 1, students from across the state made over 7,000 calls on the Madhya Pradesh Board of Secondary Education (MPBSE) helplines. Students asking subject-specific questions are put in touch with experts. Most of the doubts related to Math and English, said the counsellors.

“Children are facing lots of problems in Math and English. Students are also calling to clear doubts in Physics and Chemistry . Students from arts are seeking tips and techniques to memorize the topics,” said director MPBSE, Hemant Sharma .

“This is the time when students mostly ask about particular subjects, deal with stress and are unable to focus. Many students face problems in retaining what they have studied. For this, the counsellors advise them to take a 10-15 minute break after each hour of studying, to let the mind relax and be fresh for a new sitting.”

Now that only a month is left for the exams, it is advisable for students to thoroughly revise everything they have already studied, and not to take up a new topic.

“This is the time to solve previous years’ question papers, sample papers to gain more confidence, and solve the questions in allotted time. Solving papers is a good way to manage time and speed, and length of answers according to the allotted marks,” added Sharma.

Students are also calling up to ask the counsellors about their roll numbers and exam centres to avoid the last-minute hassle.

Vadodara: Lakhs of residents of northern and eastern parts of the city have been spending sleepless night as a strong stench wafts through these areas. The foul smell resembling to some gas caused irritation to many and even triggered panic among the locals in some areas.

This is the fourth time in as many yeas that these areas have reeled under ‘mysterious’ foul smell which has brought the role of chemical industries on the northern end of the city under the scanner.

The areas which were worst affected included Gorwa, Gotri, Nizampura, Chhani, Karelibaug and Harni.

Environment activist Rohit Prajapati said that the exact cause of this stench is still a mystery.

“It may be due to industrial pollution on the northern end of the city or due to discharge of effluents in storm water drains. The GPCB has to do systematic monitoring of air quality round the year but it doesn’t do it and hence we aren’t able to find the exact cause of the foul smell,” Prajapati told TOI.

The stench became stronger by late evening in Gorwa and soon spread to other areas. These six areas combined have a population of nearly three lakh.

Chandrahash Desai, a resident of Chhani, said, The stench was so intense and we faced bit difficulty in breathing even inside our home. I have been staying here for last 40 years, but the smell and pollution seems to have gone up over last few years.

Ami Ravat, who also runs an NGO working for environment, added, “The stench has now become a regular phenomenon during winters. Environmental experts say that this gas is harmful for pregnant women, children and senior citizens.”

Ravat has written a letter to GPCB, municipal commissioner and district collector, demanding full investigation in the nagging issue.

Prajapati’s team is also monitoring the air in these areas for some days and try to find out the exact cause. The stench problem mostly aggravates during winters due to wind direction and the air getting heavier.

GPCB regional director, R B Trivedi, “It is yet to be seen if the stench was due to some fault in any industries’ system or it is a regular phenomenon. We will monitor both Nandesari GIDC and the petrochemical complex areas.”

“We have started monitoring air quality from Thursday night using equipment to find out the component of the gas along with the source. We have also asked some industries to submit reports of the air quality in their premises,” he added.

YS Jaganmohan Reddy

AMARAVATI: The setting up of select committee to look into the bills regarding three capital cities and CRDA repeal is heading towards another showdown between YSRC and TDP as the process is yet to begin.

Sources said that senior officials at legislative council have not sent any official communication to whips of political parties seeking names to constitute the panel.

Legislative council chairman M A Shariff had announced the bills would be referred to a select committee on January 22. He had used discretionary powers under Rule 154 despite knowing that the case did not merit such a call. Subsequently, the chairman asked legislature secretary to send letters to whips of TDP, YSRC and PDF to suggest names for the panel.

A week later, the committee is yet to be formed. Sources said the council secretariat officials are revisiting rules on the procedure. It is not clear whether the officials could say no to chairman’s directive.

Sources said the senior officials were in a tight spot after YSRC raised objection about the formation of the select committee.

The leader of the council and deputy CM Pilli Subhash Chandra Bose wrote to assembly secretary asking him not to initiate any action on the chairman’s decision as it was against the rules. “The chairman has no powers to refer the bills to the select committee by using his discretionary powers. The select committee could not be constituted till the House is reconvened and voting is taken on the issue,” Bose said.

He said the chairman had not put the issue of referring the bills to the select committee for voting irrespective of the fact as to who had the majority. Bose said the chairman announced his decision under pressure from Chandrababu Naidu and left the House. “Can the chairman dissolve the House by using his discretionary powers? Rule 154 has its own limitations and it can’t be used in this case,” said Bose.

Vijayawada: It looks like trouble is brewing for chief minister Y S Jaganmohan Reddy in his home turf – Rayalaseema region. A section of leaders from the region are holding consultations to launch a separate statehood agitation. A sub-regional party is also being considered to take forward the demand.

Though Jaganmohan Reddy had promised to shift the high court and other legal bodies of the state government, including the department of law from the secretariat to Kurnool in the region, these leaders are not happy with it. “The crux of our demands is to give more funds to the region and focus on the irrigation projects,” said M Purushotham Reddy, convener of the Rayalaseema Intellectuals Forum.

A preliminary meeting of senior leaders from the dominant Kotla, Gangula and KE families of the region had felt the need to start the movement, along the lines of Telangana Rashtra Samiti (TRS). These families from the region, who represent Congress and TDP, are now trying to start the movement, even if the high court becomes a reality for the region. Former minister and senior leader from the region, M V Mysoora Reddy, took the initiative, in holding this preliminary meeting of the leaders.

It was decided to start a regional party for Rayalaseema and the process is likely to be completed in the next six months. The leaders have decided to meet in the next two weeks with the draft proposal to move forward, raising the demand for separate Rayalaseema state.

The leaders have felt that there is a political vacuum in the region, though the former chief minister and the present chief minister are from this region. “The former chief minister and the present chief minister are locked in a battle over Amaravati and not raising the issue of Rayalaseema,” a senior leader who was part of the meeting said.

“The chief minister talks about the Sri Bagh Pact and had promised us the high court. But there is ambiguity in the decentralisation Bill,” Purushotham Reddy said.

The chief minister had promised that all legal bodies, including the commissions for SCs, STs, BCs, minorities and women would be located in Kurnool along with the high court. The legal and quasi-judicial bodies of the state government too would be headquartered in Kurnool. All the judicial commissions of the government would also be moved to Kurnool.

“We are asking for our due share in development. That does not mean we are against Amaravati,” Purushotham Reddy told TOI.

Nagpur: The beauty of painted faces and amazing postures in performing Kathakali dance takes everyone’s breath away, but what goes behind to put this act together is the script and story selected from mythology.

People, especially non-Malayalis, often fail to understand the essence of these stories since it is narrated in Malayalam. Now, here is an opportunity for all Kathakali lovers to understand the story as the songs will be accompanied by Hindi and English commentary.

Kathakali dance drama ‘Narakasuravadham (the death of Narakasura)’ will be performed at 7pm on Sunday as part of the ongoing three-day All-India Classical Dance Competition and Festival being held at Sai Sabhagruh.

Janardhanan Nair of Pratibha Natya Mandir believes the commentary will attract all dance lovers. “The narration is always in Malayalam. As Nagpur is a multi-lingual city, we wanted people to understand the storyline so that they could enjoy the performance to the fullest,” he said.

Manish Nair, who will be doing the commentary, said,“Kathakali reflects Malayalam culture. Hence, we decided to use Hindi and English to make the performance more people friendly. The story of Narakasura will sure be liked by Kathakali lovers,” he said.

The act will be performed by Kalamamdalam Adthiyan and troupe from Kerala. The story of Narakasuravadham revolves around demon king Narakasura who deputes Nakrathundi to capture damsels from heaven. The demoness travels to heaven, nabs a few and starts her return journey.

“On her way, Nakrathundi meets young and handsome Jayantha, son of Indra. Attracted to him, the demoness approaches Jayantha in the guise of beautiful Lalitha. She reveals her longing for Jayantha, but he turns down her proposal for marriage,” said Manish, explaining the story.

A disappointed Lalitha then turns into ferocious Nakrathundi and tries to abduct Jayantha. In the tussle that follows, Jayantha mutilates Nakrathundi by cutting off her ears, nose and breasts. The rest of the story is about the revenge of Narakasura who defeats Indra, but is later killed by Lord Krishna.

“The performers are on their way to present their art in all its glory. However, the songs will be in Malayali,” said Rajan Nambiar, president of NSS.

Diwali sybolizes the victory of Lord Krishna over Narkasura--good over evil.

Aurangabad: MPs , MLAs and ZP presidents from the region cutting across party lines, as well as experts, will meet in the city on February 4 to discuss the water grid project and demand that the government continue it, said Gangapur MLA Prashant Bumb of BJP on Friday.

The announcement comes a day after deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar expressed doubts over the feasibility of the water grid project.

Bumb said that public representatives from Marathwada will try to convince the government to continue the project. “This is the fourth such meeting of region’s public representatives in the last 10 years. If the demand is valid, the government will listen to us,” he told reporters.

Bumb said the current state government is sensitive towards implementing measures to pull Marathwada out of backwardness.

Bumb said the acute water shortage, lack of industry, unemployment, poor education standards, lack of good roads, inadequate health machinery and irregular electricity supply continues to keep Marathwada in a poor condition.

“Even today, women in rural areas of the region have to travel 2 to 3km to get drinking water. Water availability would also allow industrial settlements in every district, ” the BJP MLA said.

Mesh installed into the abdomen

AURANGABAD: The department of general surgery at the Government Medical College and Hospital ( GMCH ) performed its first laparoscopic umbilical hernioplasty surgery on a 35-year-old man on Wednesday. The patient was discharged on Friday and did not suffer from any post-operative complication.Doctors at the GMCH said that the patient was diagnosed with umbilical hernia. Following diagnosis, it was observed that the case would require surgery.According to head of department of surgery at GMCH Suresh Harbade, umbilical hernia occurs at the time of the birth when the foetus is separated from the umbilicus. “The opening of umbilicus should close soon after birth but, in some cases, the opening stays, causing a bulge in the abdomen. This causes pain and, at times, strangulation of small intestine in some cases,” Harbade said. This defect requires a surgery in 0.5 to 1% of individuals due to the severity.Earlier, due to the lack of technology, umbilical hernia was treated by conducting an open surgery that required 5-6 centimetre long incision. However, the GMCH surgeons recently attended medical conferences at Odisha, Amrawati and at Aurangabad and acquired the skill for conducting laparoscopic umbilical hernioplasty surgery. The hospital also recently procured kits required for conducting the surgery under Mahatma Jyotiba Phule Jan Arogya Yojana.Subsequently, on Wednesday, a procedure was performed under the guidance of S.P Jadhav by surgeons Suresh Harbade, Junaid Athar and assisted by Vakil Khan, Kapil Dev Patil, Harsh Mehta and Shailesh Patil. Two incisions of 5 mm were made on the abdomen of the patient and the defect was repaired by installing a mesh into the abdomen.The doctors at the hospital said that the surgery was conducted for the first time in GMCH and was successful.",aurangabad,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73832024,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-246535,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/gmch-conducts-first-laparoscopic-hernia-repair/articleshow/73815752.cms

MUMBAI: Motorists Atul Khatau and Joaquim Reis were in for a shock when the toll booth at the Bandra-Worli Sea Link deducted the toll amount twice at one go—through both their new FASTag stickers and old ETC tags fixed on cars.

Though the amount was refunded later, hundreds of motorists with both old and new tags have been facing the problem, admit officials. Toll booth staffers have therefore advised motorists to not put up FASTag on window screens till the ETC tag is fully exhausted.

Complaint log books at the sea link plaza are filled with refund requests, said Khatau’s father Harsh.

On Mumbai-Pune Expressway , too, motorists have been facing similar issues. Pune’s Prashant Patil was charged twice last week.

A senior MSRDC official said complaints of double deduction are being resolved by not charging motorists on their return or next journey. MSRDC joint managing director Vijay Waghmare said till two days ago, there were 76 complaints out of 4,000 transactions on the sea link and the process was on to refund the wrongly deducted amount on return journey in genuine cases. “All ETC passes will expire in February and then on only FASTags must be bought and used. We hope to resolve the matter soon. Also, double deduction complaints on the E-way have reduced as the system is getting synchronised well now,” he said.

Rajiv Singh, chief general manager, NHAI, Mumbai Circle, said complaints at NHAI booths are being resolved through a helpline on ‘myfastag’ app. “People who have bought FASTag through any of the 24 banks can register complaints on the respective websites as well as on Indian Highways Management Company Ltd website or helpline (1033), NHAI’s own endeavour.”

Bhopal: A single-judge bench of MP high court has ordered Anuppur collector Chandramohan Thakur to be personally present in court in connection with a contempt petition for non-compliance of a court order by which it had stayed transfer of the petitioner.

The court took strong exception to collector writing in his note-sheet that the court has stayed transfer of the petitioner without examining the transfer order.

The bench of Justice Sanjay Dwivedi while asking for personal presence of the district collector said “From the document Annexure-C/4, the note-sheet written by the respondent/collector, it is a clear case of contempt.Collector Anuppur is directed to remain present before this Court on February 4, 2020.”

Counsel for the petitioner, P N Chaturvedi, told the court that despite the interim stay granted by the high court over his transfer from Anuppur to Gwalior, the collector and other officials concerned didn’t allow him to join at Anuppur again. Besides, a fresh transfer was issued on December 6, 20`19, thereby, transferring the petitioner to Badwani in place of Gwalior. The operation of modified transfer order was also stayed by the court.

Yavatmal: Fate of all six candidates vying for the MLC seat from local self-government bodies was sealed in the ballot boxes on Friday even as the bypoll recorded 100% voting. Counting of votes will take place at the district collectorate on February 4.

Nagpur: History is being repeated as discriminatory laws devised 100 years ago are brought back into force to discriminate against citizens on the basis of their religion. In order to stop this, one needs to closely study Mahatma Gandhi ’s approach to such situations, said senior journalist and thinker Suresh Dwadashiwar at Sanskrutik Sankul, Vidarbha Sahitya Sangh, on Thursday.

He was delivering a lecture on ‘Gandhi’s thinking needed for social cohesion’. The event was organized by Jagtik Ahinsa Din Aayojan Samiti and Swayam NGO to pay homage to Mahatma Gandhi on his death anniversary.

Dwadashiwar said, “In all of the world’s history, there has been only one personality to respect every religion equally and distinctively while advocating unity in the name of humanity. And that was Gandhi. His ideology can be learnt through his way of life and the journey he traversed in the freedom struggle.”

He noted, “Whenever Gandhi was asked about his religion, he would claim that he is a Sanatani Hindu. Sanatani means eternal. He saw all religions as equal and accepted all the beliefs impartially. At the core, he believed in truth and humanity and spent his life guiding the path of non-violence.”

Turning the pages of history, Dwadashiwar revealed lesser known facts about Gandhi’s conduct during revolutionary movements. Delving into the origin of Hindu, Buddha, Islam and Christianity religions, he said, “There have been wars on the basis of religion and sub-groups which lasted for years together.”

“There has been a significant difference among those who advocate a religion and those who lost lives in the name of religion in these wars,” he added.

“Gandhi was not someone who just preached lessons. He was the one to rise to the moment to face any obstacle that followed. It is this country’s honour that a personality like Gandhi was born in this land.”

Present at the programme were former MP Vilas Muttemwar, MLA Vikas Thakre, Girish Gandhi and Baban Taywade.

Muttemwar said, “Gandhi’s thoughts are not orthodox. His notions are relevant today considering the discriminatory situation prevalent in the country. Everyone should take a pledge to emulate Gandhi’s ideology.”

Swayam NGO president Vishal Muttemwar, who anchored the programme, said, “The young generation must perceive Gandhi’s ideas and understand the current divisive game plan.”

A committee, headed by the chief secretary, interviewed five shortlisted candidates earlier this week. The names have been forwarded to the chief minister’s office and the chairperson’s name is expected to get finalised any day.

In all, 29 environmental experts were in the fray for the MPPCB chairperson’s post. The scrutiny committee, comprising officials of the environment department, Environmental Planning & Coordination Organisation (EPCO) and designates, shortlisted five candidates and their interviews were conducted by the committee.

“A state government official meeting criterion for the post may be appointed as the chairperson,” said a official who was a part of the selection process.

In September last year, the state government had framed guidelines for appointment of the MPPCB’s chairperson — almost three decades after it came into existence.

MPPCB has been running without a full-time chairperson for the last five years. In case there is no full-time chairperson, the principal secretary, environment, is the ex-officio chairperson of MPPCB. The state government had to frame the appointment rules following directives of the National Green Tribunal (NGT).

The procurement of equipment worth Rs 36 crore from last financial year (2018-19) has not yet been completed. The GMCH authorities gave a presentation regarding the equipment procurement to district guardian minister Subhash Desai on Thursday.

In 2017-2018, funds worth Rs 53.83 crore were approved and received for GMCH and GCH but equipment worth Rs 29.18 crore was received. In 2018-2019, Rs 36.30 crore were provided for the two hospitals but not a single equipment has been received.

GMCH acting dean Kailash Zine said equipments such as ventilators and department specific instruments crucial for diagnosis and treatment are awaited.

The GMCH’s paediatric department has only four ventilators. The doctors have to use the ventilators based on the severity of the case and other patients needing ventilator support are kept on manually-operated ambu-bags.

“The directorate of medical education and research, under which, the institution runs has been informed about the delay in procurement,” Zine said.

They, however, left their friend, Alok Ranjan (21), in the ambulance on reaching the campus of a private hospital at Kankarbagh after realising that he was dead.

The ambulance driver, Lallan Kumar, then took the body to Patliputra police station on the intervening night of Thursday and Friday. The dead youth was a resident of Gola Road under the Danapur police station area. He was preparing for engineering examinations. Alok’s father Ashok Kumar is an LIC agent.

SHO of Patliputra police station Kamleshwar Prasad Singh said efforts were on to locate the two youths – Himanshu Kumar and Abhishek Kumar – who had left Alok’s body at the Kankarbagh hospital. “The duo first reached a private hospital near Patliputra roundabout in a bike along with Alok. They later hired an ambulance and visited two more private hospitals. Finally, the two disappeared after doctors at Kankarbagh hospital declared Alok brought dead,” the SHO said.

He added that the bike used by the two youths was seized from road number 6 of Indrapuri. “The victim’s father has told police that the bullet hit his son accidentally while he was playing with a pistol along with his friends,” the SHO said, adding it was still not clear how the youths got the pistol.

Vijayawada: Social activist Swamy Agnivesh on Friday said urged people to protest against the Citizenship Amendment Act ( CAA ) and the proposal to implement National Register of Citizens ( NRC ) and National Population Register ( NPR ).

The Alliance Against NRC, CAA and NPR organised a public meeting at Makineni Basava Punnaiah Stadium here on Friday.

The meeting was attended by Dr Rajaratnam Prakash Ambedkar, the grandson of Dr B R Ambedkar, Jamia Islami Hind state president Md Raffiq, former JNU student Umar Khalid and others.

Agnivesh said BJP and RSS were promoting violence to bring in a fascist regime in the country. He said the Jamia Milia incident was an example of how the BJP was instigating violence and added that the party was trying to split society along caste and religious lines.

Dr Prakash Ambedkar said the protests against CAA will not stop till it was rolled back. He said the BJP was trying to cancel reservations for Dalits. He appealed to people to rise above caste and religion to oppose the CAA and said that they would build more Shaheen Baghs across the country.

HYDERABAD: As four more persons with symptoms of Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) were admitted to state-run Fever Hospital on Friday, the health authorities urged people to avoid crowded places. “People should not panic about Coronavirus, but be careful and avoid crowded places as a precaution,” read a statement issued by the health department.In a huge relief for authorities, the much-awaited testing kits arrived from Delhi and the state government said they would begin testing samples within 48 hours in Hyderabad. The samples of the four persons, including a woman, were sent to National Institute of Virology (NIV) Pune, along with two more samples for tests.These four persons are between 25 years and 40 years of age and travelled to China in the last fortnight. “With new suspected cases reported on Friday, we have a total of 15 suspected cases, of which nine have been tested negative. The report of six other samples are awaited from NIV Pune,” said Vijay Kumar, state nodal officer.Officials at Gandhi Medical College, where testing for Novel Coronavirus will begin, said that sufficient number of kits have arrived in the first batch. “Once the tests are done here, they will be sent to NIV Pune to check that the tests have been done correctly. After getting a go-ahead from NIV, all tests will be done locally,” said an official.Experts suggest maintaining high level of personal hygiene, exercise and self-isolation for 14 days in case people, who had travelled to China, witness symptoms. “Please do not send children to school if they feel sick.

188,['1/02/2020'],Maharashtra: Longer wait this year for good supply of Alphonso,"This story is from February 1, 2020

By March, markets receive mangoes in good quantities (File photo)

PUNE: Mango lovers will have to wait for nearly one-and-a-half months more this year for their favourite Alphonso to reach the markets in good quantities.

A horticulture department estimate revealed Ratnagiri was likely to produce around 1,30,000 tonnes of the fruit this March-April as against 1,53,000 tonnes during the same period last year. The dip in supplies during the initial period of the mango season has been caused by a delay in the flowering process due to last year’s extended rainy season.

Unlike in the past, mangoes are not expected to flood the markets this March and growers said there would be almost an 80% shortage of the fruit during the month because of the delay in flowering in the Ratnagiri-Sindhudurg mango belt. Mangoes usually start reaching the markets after mid-February. By March, the markets receive mangoes in good quantities.

Vidyadhar Joshi, director of Devgad Taluka Mango Growers’ Association, told TOI that not even 10% flowering of mango trees has so far started in Konkan — right from Raigad to Vengurla. “Konkan recorded heavy and prolonged rain last year. The extended rainy season stopped the flowering stage in mango trees and caused a vegetative flush. The flowering started only recently and the rate is slow. The flowering process is expected to continue during almost the entire February and March,” he said.

Mango fruits begin to develop only after the flowers are pollinated. “This means that there will be almost 80-90% shortage in mango supplies during February end and March in comparison to what these months normally get. Supplies will be almost 50% less than normal in April too, while a glut will hit the markets in May,” Joshi said.

Vivek Bhide, president of the Konkan Mango Growers and Sellers’ Association, said, “This seems to be the first time in many years that the arrival of mangoes in normal quantities into the markets may be delayed so much. The result will be 70-80% less supplies in March. Three conditions are needed during end of October to November 10 for mango flowering— ‘waaphasa' (mixture of 50 % air and 50 % water vapour in the cavities between two soil particles), night temperatures below 20ºC and appropriate wind flow. These conditions have to occur simultaneously. This did not happen in 2019 October-November.”

Mandar Desai, an Alphonso grower in Ratnagiri, said, “In comparison to last year, we may see a 70% shortage of the fruit in March this year. Usual mango stocks may start trickling in after April 20. People may face a shortage of mangoes during the two major festivals — Gudi Padwa (March 25) and Akshaya Tritiya (April 26) — when the demand for the fruit is high in Maharashtra .”

S K Godse, a retired professor of Balasaheb Sawant Konkan Krishi Vidyapeeth, said, “For the mango trees to flower, constant cold temperatures are needed for 10-15 days. This has not happened since November-December last year.”

189,['1/02/2020'],Our achievements are really a disadvantage,"This story is from February 1, 2020

For Kerala, the Union Budget for FY21 is a dampener – glaringly, it didn’t get any notable project that is of specific benefit to the state or its people. However, there is a more disturbing aspect that is going to undermine the state’s own capital and revenue expenditures that fund developmental activities as well as usual administrative works and it is the decline of Kerala’s share of the tax revenue from the central government from Rs 17,872 crore in FY20 to Rs 15,236 crore in FY21.

A cocktail of reasons is behind Kerala’s dwindling tax share from the Union government – political as well as Finance Commission’s Terms of Reference (ToR) change and also Kerala’s achievement in social sector reforms.

Economists and policy wonks had only noticed this decline in Kerala’s share of ‘divisible pool’, the central government’s revenue from income tax and corporation tax, triggered by a change in the ToR used by the Finance Commission, an autonomous and constitutional body that works as an arbitrator between the Centre and states regarding sharing the revenue.

“The change in ToR has caused a decline in Kerala’s share of divisible pool,” said D Narayana, former director, Gulati Institute of Finance and Taxation. According to him, till the 12th Finance Commission, the share of each state was decided based on the population figures of 1971 and from the latest 14th Financial Commission, it is based on 2011 figures.

Between 1971 and 2011, the population of north Indian States like UP, Rajasthan, Bihar and Madhya Pradesh grew significantly while that of Kerala was almost stable. As the population share of northern states were high, they are getting more allocation. As a result, Kerala’s share of divisible pool came down from 2.5% last year to 1.93% this year.

According to K K Krishnakumar, fellow, Centre for Socio-Economic & Environmental Studies, Kochi, apart from the ToR change, there is another reason that is hurting the flow of resources from the Centre. “Kerala’s share of resources from almost all the flagship projects of the central government are relatively low compared to the northern states, because the state had already achieved considerable levels of development, especially in education and healthcare,” he said.

“Take the case of Samagra Shiksha, which funds opening new schools, where Kerala received only Rs 206 crore in FY19, instead of the original indicative allocation of Rs 413 crore. While Kerala’s actual allocation was only 49.84% of the indicative one, Tamil Nadu received 100%, Madhya Pradesh 103%, Odisha 105% and Bihar 106%,” Krishnakumar said.

“We have been penalised for our own advancement in social sector. We had been facing this issue since the 1990s,” he said.

Except for the employment guarantee programme MNREGS, Kerala’s share in all other flagship schemes like Samagra Shiksha, National Health Mission, PMGSY and Social Security Pension, is low, Krishnakumar said. High population density, land cost and environmental awareness are other factors that hinder allocation of flagship infrastructure projects in Kerala, he said. Bringing down the width of NHs from 60 metres to 45 is an example.

Amaravati: Making an attempt to broker peace with farmers in the capital city region, YSRC MP Lavu Srikrishnadevarayalu visited dharna camps in Mandadam and Velagapudi villages on Friday.

He said he would negotiate with chief minister Y S Jaganmohan Reddy and said the CM is a pro-farmer leader. Krishnadevarayalu is the first YSRC leader to enter the protest zone and address the farmers.

Krishnadevarayaulu said that farmers should come out with their demands for an amicable solution with the government. “We know that your anger is genuine. We never found fault with your protests. The chief minister is more concerned about bailing out the farmers from any crisis, and not just in the capital city. He is a pro-farmer leader,” said the MP amidst Jai Amaravati slogans.

He cautioned the farmers not to fall in the trap of the vested interests that might drag the without resolving it. Farmers were raising their voice as agriculture land given for the capital were not earned through speculation, he said.

He said the state government was willing to resolve all issues of local land-owning farmers if they were ready to negotiate. He asked the farmers to get ready for talks. The CM would not go ahead on any issue if it meant a loss to farmers, the MP said and added the YSRC got 151 seats only due to support of all sections of society and the party would not ignore anyone. The process of rendering justice to farmers should begin soon, he said.

While local YSRC legislators V Sridevi (Tadikonda), Alla Ramakrishna Reddy (Mangalagiri) have kept themselves away from the farmers, local MP Galla Jayadev of TDP has been leading the protests from the front.

193,['1/02/2020'],Maharashtra: Census training to curtail summer break for teachers,"This story is from February 1, 2020

Representative image

PUNE: Government school teachers in the state will have fewer days of summer vacation this year. Their training for gathering census data will begin from June 1 and go on till June 15.

Schools close officially on May 1 for teachers, but post-exam and results’ work go on till May 15, and they reopen in the first week of June. Teachers can thus expect a mere 15-day break.

The Maharashtra Primary Teachers’ Samiti president Uday Shinde said the government was told to conduct the training before Diwali vacations.

“The last four months of the academic year have sports events, annual gatherings, science exhibitions and completion of the syllabus. Once the annual exams are over, teachers are into paper correction and results related work. The census training will ruin summer vacations for all teachers,” he added.

Bhau Chaskar, a teacher, said, “We had to face a similar situation during elections. We will have to sacrifice our summer vacation. Such trainings must be well-planned so that teachers are not burdened.”

Teachers’ associations said many teachers are involved in board exam related work during this period. The second phase of census work will be in October which again is examinations time.

Bhiwandi MLA Kapil Patil, who met director of Census Operations Rashmi Zagade on Thursday, demanded that teachers should be the last resource for census work.

“Teachers on deputation for census work should get 45 days of earned leave. It was approved and implemented during the last census,” he said.

Those above 55 years of age, pregnant woman, physically disabled, women whose children are below one year of age should be exempted from census work.

The Census department wants the Maharashtra government to provide 2.5 lakh teachers for the decennial headcount and collection of National Population Register (NPR) data across the state.

Census officials said the teachers would be helpful for the work once the formal notification was issued.

Nashik: The Nashik Municipal Corporation (NMC) and city police on Friday undertook a special anti-encroachment drive in several areas including, Shalimar , Nepali Corner, Dhumal Point, Raviwar Karanja and Dwarka .

Under the guidance of commissioner of police Vishwas Nangare-Patil, police personnel have been working on clearing congestion on city roads over the last few weeks.

The anti-encroachment drive was carried out following Nangare-Patil’s visit to the Dwarka junction where he inspected the flow of traffic. Subsequently, the municipal corporation, in association with the city police, conducted the drive to clear congestion on roads.

In the morning, ACP Pradeep Jadhav and senior PI of Bhadrakali police station Sajan Sonawane conducted a meeting with the hawkers at the Nepali corner and informed them about the anti-encroachment drive. Later in the day, the entire Nepali corner area was cleared of encroachments.

PI Sajan Sonawane said that encroachments from Dhumal Point to Raviwar Karanja were also removed as part of the drive.

The hawkers were given the option of relocating to the backside of the Regional Referral Hospital. However, many of them objected to the proposal.

Meanwhile, at Dwarka, some hawkers rushed to the nearby subway to secure a spot for conducting business. The police, however, said that it was upon the civic body to decide whether the hawkers can operate from the subway.

Led by Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP), for five days now, protesting students have been demanding that the authorities’ roll back their decision.On Friday, hundreds of students gathered outside the main gate, as they unanimously boycotted classes. They said that the government’s decision to stop aid to 67 colleges, including AV College, promotes privatisation of education .“The government has transferred many faculty members to government colleges. It is unfair for many students as the fee structure for four courses has been enhanced from Rs 600 to Rs 22,500,” said Mahesh Kosgi, a student.Many students have also raised concerns on social media using the hashtag avcollegebachao (save AV College). Shiva Kumar, a student, tweeted, “Many years ago, AV College was established. It is aided college which is built by freedom fighters. Now it is going to convert into private college, fees will be increased and many poor students lose their education and bright future. Hence, please convert into government college (sic) #avcollegebachao.”As a mark of protest, hundreds of students from aided colleges across the state have also sent postcards to governor Tamilisai Soundararajan. Students are wearing black badges to their classes as well. There are many other aided colleges, such as Bhadruka College, Kasturba Gandhi College, Andhra Mahila Sabha College, where protests are likely to be intensified.Terming the protests as uncalled for, officials said that there was no change in the government’s decision. “The protests seem politically influenced, as there are barely two courses from a pool of 40-50 courses, which are aided.

Bhopal: Amid the spread of Coronavirus in China, Madhya Pradesh has taken up the issue with the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) about students from the state being stranded in China.

Chief minister Kamal Nath said on Friday that the government has asked the MEA to immediately arrange for the safe return of the Indian students.

“Information has been received about three students of Khargone district of the state being trapped in China, and asking for help. We will request the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) today to immediately arrange for the safe return of these students,"" tweeted Nath on Friday. An Air India flight was sent to Wuhan on Friday to bring back Indian students stuck in Hubei province, the epicentre of coronavirus.

The students, Shubham Gupta and Abdul Mateen Khan, in a video message released on Wednesday, had said that they had been confined to their rooms and risk of contracting the disease was so high that they covered their mouths throughout the day and spoke to each other on mobile phones, despite being in same hostel room. They had even contacted Indian embassy for their evacuation, they had said in the message.

Talking to TOI on Friday, Santosh Gupta, Shubham’s father said that his son informed him in the evening that he along with Abdul Mateen Khan were listed for evacuation back to India.

Gupta said that as flights had been started to evacuate Indians from coronavirus prone areas, Shubham and Mateen would hopefully be back in India within a day or two. ""The citizens should not be worried about the infection of Coronavirus. The state government has already issued comprehensive guidelines for control and prevention from the virus. We have issued instructions to make special arrangements for this in all hospitals of the state,” stated the chief minister in a series of tweets.

203,['1/02/2020'],"RSS chief in MP; hope he will will promote unity, says Cong","This story is from February 1, 2020

Bhopal: Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) chief Mohan Bhagwat reached here on Friday for his weeklong visit to the state. Bhagwat will take stock of the organisational activities during his visit, said sources.

Bhagwat’s visit has sparked a debate between BJP and Congress with the latter alleging that RSS was provoking youths in the name of Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA). The BJP has also hit out at Congress for “misguiding” people on CAA.

“RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat will be in the state. I welcome him. I also expect that during his visit, he will deliver the message of peace, unity and brotherhood,” said state higher education minister Jitu Patwari.

While the public relations minister PC Sharma said, “Bhagwatji will be in MP. I request him not to provoke youths during his stay in the state.” A day before, chief minister Kamal Nath had also welcomed RS chief to MP. “Bhagwatji is free to visit Bhopal anytime. We expect that he would give a right direction to the state and the country,” he had said on Thursday.

The chief minister also raised questions over the need of bringing CAA instead of focusing on economy and unemployment in the country. “What is the need for bringing CAA now, when the country is grappling with severe problems? Now they are roaming around to garner public support and misguiding people away from burning issues,” Nath had said.

BJP hit back at Congress.

“It is the Congress, who is spreading confusion and provoking people on CAA. MP chief minister will not decide what would be the next step of BJP and RSS on the CAA. The BJP and RSS do not require Kamal Nath’s certificate on any issue,” said BJP state president Rakesh Singh.

Sources said Bhagawat reached RSS regional headquarters Samidha in Bhopal on Friday afternoon and left for Guna after meeting some party cadres. On Saturday, he will inaugurate a three-day convention of college-going youths in Guna, which is being organised by the Sangh Parivar. The RSS chief will address 2,000 student volunteers in organisational activities. Senior RSS office-bearers, including Akhil Bharatiya Prachar Pramukh Arun Kumar will also participate in the camp.

Bhagwat’s three-day visit to Bhopal from February 4 assumes significance as in the political circles it is believed that he would discuss party’s public awareness campaign on CAA and the future plans to gain public support on ideological issues with BJP leaders. The BJP has also involved intellectuals and select social activists to hold discussions with the RSS chief during his stay. The BJP leaders are also preparing for a discussion over ideological issues during Bhagwat’s visit, said sources.

206,['1/02/2020'],Aurangabad: Police register five more offences for child pornography,"This story is from February 1, 2020

Representative image

AURANGABAD: Almost 20 days after the Aurangabad city police registered three cases against unidentified suspects who used Facebook and other social media platforms to upload child pornography content, five more offences were registered under sections of Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act on Friday.

City police commissioner Chiranjeev Prasad said based on complaints lodged by cops serving with the cybercrime police station, the offences were registered with Jinsi, Waluj, Osmanpura and City Chowk police stations.

Police authorities said 10 ‘Tiplines’ have originated from Aurangabad city. Out of these, three offences were registered on January 10 and 11, while out of the remaining seven, five were registered on Friday.

Cyber police said that following the technical analysis of the uploaded content, their source was found to be from the limits of different police stations in the city.

Highly placed sources said that the offences are a result of a memorandum of understanding (MoU) between the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) of India and the National Centre for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC) of the US. As per the pact signed in the first quarter of 2019, the US will help India in receiving Tipline reports on online child pornography and child sexual exploitation content from NCMEC.

A cyber crime officer said police swung into action after a citizen sent an alert about the content. “Such tips sent to law enforcement agencies through helpline numbers or websites automatically get converted into a report for action and it is called Tipline report.”

The officer added that there is a unique identity number generated for each of the Tipline report and its status can be checked by punching the said number.

The agreement enables law enforcement agencies to remove child pornography and child sexual abuse material from cyber space, and initiate action against those uploading such content.

207,['1/02/2020'],Wife of man who held 25 kids hostage in UP's Farrukhabad lynched,"This story is from February 1, 2020

Subhash Batham (L), his wife Ruby

KATHARIYA VILLAGE (FARRUKHABAD): Subhash Batham, a murder convict who held a fake birthday party for his daughter in UP’s Farrukhabad and then held 25 children who were his “guests” hostage for several hours, was shot dead by police early on Friday morning.

His wife, Ruby, who was allegedly an accomplice to the act, died in a hospital soon after after angry local residents pelted her with stones, lynching her. Police on Friday filed an FIR against 300 unknown people under section 302 (punishment for murder).

Police, forensic teams and the bomb disposal squad (Moradabad) claimed they had recovered 145 crude bombs, including a cylinder bomb and a can bomb, along with wire, battery, tape, sutali (thread) that they said were used in a bomb hurled by Batham, injuring two dial 112 constables and SHO Mohammdabad.

Twenty live cartridges, 11 used cartridges of a country-made pistol and a 315 bore rifle were recovered from his house, police said, along with the used cartridge of an AK-47. Some of the children who had been held hostage had, however, told TOI that they saw only a katta and another country made rifle with Batham.

Police said Batham — who never attended school — acquired his ""bomb-making skills"" during a 12-year stint in jail after he was convicted of murder. The basement in which he held the children hostage doubled up as his laboratory where he painstakingly readied the crude bombs, cops added, suggesting he had been planning his act for a long time.

But as far as his motives are concerned, there are different theories — anger at the residents for boycotting him for a long time for marrying a Dalit woman; allegedly being left out of government schemes and enmity against those who testified against him in court in the murder case.

According to police, Batham had claimed on the night of the incident that the gram pradhan of Kathariya village and a local MLA had falsely implicated him in his uncle’s murder due to which he had ended up wasting his youth in prison. The gram pradhan, Harvir Singh, told TOI that he indeed testified in court against Batham and that’s why the man held enmity against him. “Batham murdered his uncle in 2001 after he had caught him stealing valuables from a neighbour’s house and scolded him. I was a witness in the case.”

Commenting on a letter that Batham had written to authorities — demanding a house and toilet under government schemes — and which he handed to police on Thursday night, the gram pradhan said his demands were baseless. “He had written the letter for a house under the PM Awas Yojana and a toilet under Swachh Bharat Mission years ago.” The real motive, he insisted, was revenge against him and village residents.

Bhojpur MLA Nagendra Singh — who was also the target of Batham’s fury — said that he didn’t know the man but had visited the spot to calm down the situation. “He wanted revenge as he was boycotted by the community for marrying a Dalit woman four years ago,” he said.

Anil Kumar Mishra, SP (Farrukhabad), said, “The hostage situation could have been created to extort money as he demanded Rs 1 crore for each kid. He also wanted all criminal cases expunged against him.” Batham had five criminal cases going on against him in local courts.

Whatever the motive, he was well prepared, claimed police. “The quantity of bombs was good enough to kill everyone in a radius of 50m if they went off at once,” said Farrukhabad special operation group in charge, Dinesh Kumar Gautam.

Batham was shot even as the crowd of 300 pelted stones at their house. “As they were attacking the couple at the front door, we entered the house from the back. When he saw his wife being attacked, he grabbed his country-made rifle after which he was shot dead,” said Mishra.

Some residents, however, alleged that policemen “encouraged local residents to pelt stones at the couple”. On Friday, the couple’s bodies were sent for autopsy, while their two-and-a-half-year-old daughter Kusum was handed over to child authorities.

HYDERABAD: Impressed with Mumbai police’s innovative concept of ‘The Punishing Signal’, Telangana minister KT Rama Rao advised the top officials of municipal and police departments to launch similar enforcement initiative to reduce noise pollution at traffic signals.To curb honking menace and reduce noise pollution on crowded city streets, Mumbai police have launched ‘The Punishing Signal’ initiative. Mumbai police installed decibel metres at select traffic junctions and connected them to signal timers. When the cacophony at the signal crosses decibel level of 85, the signal timer resets forcing the honking motorists to wait more.Sharing a video of the initiative taken by the Mumbai police, KTR tweeted, “Let’s get this done in our Hyderabad too. Need of the hour.” The minister tagged Telangana DGP M Mahendar Reddy, Hyderabad police commissioner Anjani Kumar and GHMC commissioner Lokesh Kumar in the tweet.Responding to KTR’s tweet, police officials said they are ready to launch the initiative. “It is a good initiative to curb noise pollution. We will do it in the city,” Hyderabad police commissioner Anjani Kumar said.Punjagutta, Khairatabad, Jubilee Hills Check Post, RTC X roads Paradise and Patny X roads are some of the crowded junctions in the city.Though police have not carried out any survey about contribution of honking to noise pollution at junctions, they seem to be certain that cacophony due to honking is a problem at few traffic junctions. “We are fining motorists for noise pollution using Sound Level Meter. To prevent honking at traffic signals, decibel metres have to be installed and awareness need to be created, before the enforcement. We have some of the busiest traffic junctions like Gachibowli, Cyber towers, Kothaguda, Aramgarh, Allwyn X roads, Miyapur X roads and BHEL X roads in the city,” Cyberabad DCP Vijay Kumar said.Rachakonda commissioner Mahesh Bhagwat, under whose jurisdiction fall crowded junctions like LB Nagar and Uppal X Roads, said once GHMC procures and installs decibel metres connected to timers at the traffic signals, they will start the initiative to prevent honking.",hyderabad,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73824906,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-424390,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/ktr-wants-punishing-signal-in-hyderabad-to-curb-honking-menace/articleshow/73815832.cms

The jumbo jet, which landed in the epicentre of the deadly coronavirus , is expected to reach Delhi at 7.30 am Saturday. The government had expected 366 Indians evacuees on this flight. Some were not allowed to travel due to high fever and stopped at Wuhan airport.The special flight on Boeing 747 “Ajanta” had left Delhi on Friday afternoon with four pilots, 15 cabin crew, a team of doctors from Delhi’s RML Hospital, medical equipment and other support staff. It landed there at 7.46 pm (Wuhan time), with the pilots exclaiming in the cockpit “khaali airport, khaali roads” during final approach to the ghost town — a bustling economic centre till a few days back. Ajanta was supposed to take off at 10 pm (IST) but delayed due to factors like passengers not being able to make it on time and then screening taking more time.This is the first of the evacuation flights by India for Wuhan and AI could operate the second one on Saturday. Special arrangements have been made at IGI Airport and no person and baggage from this aircraft will need to go inside the terminal. Ajanta will be parked at a remote bay (no aerobridge) where customs and immigration will set up special counters for doing the required clearance. Passengers will board an ITBP bus from the ramp and head to their quarantine centres. Crew and other personnel on this aircraft will also remain in isolation for about a week at their homes.With AI’s director (operations) Captain Amitabh Singh on board to supervise this evacuation flight, the 423-seater aircraft took off with four pilots — two commanders Captain Kamal Mohan, Captain S H Reza; and two first officers Captain Sanjay Achalkar and Captain Bhupesh Narain. Everyone onboard the Delhi-Wuhan flight wore full protective suit on landing in Wuhan, before opening the aircraft door there.“No service will take place on the flight. Food packets and water bottles will be kept on each. There will be no interaction (between cabin crew and passengers),” said an AI official. Two lavs will be kept only for crew. AI chairman Ashwani Lohani, who was at Delhi Airport to meet the crew of this special flight, said masks have been arranged for the crew and passengers. “For our crew, we have also arranged complete protective gear,” he said.All the personnel volunteered for this flight, and subsequent ones, despite the risk of spending hours with possibly infected people in the closed environ of an aircraft, with cash-starved AI — which is unable to pay salaries on time — carrying out this operation from its resources. To be sure, all the crew and other staff will wear full protective gear during the flight back to India.Lohani tweeted: “The national carrier once again comes to the rescue - this time to evacuate Indians from Wuhan, the site of the outbreak of coronavirus. This mission begins today with a Jumbo 747 operating between Delhi and Wuhan.

AURANGABAD: Four people, including a journalist with a vernacular newspaper, were killed and five were seriously injured on the spot after their jeep rammed a parked truck on the Aurangabad-Jalna highway, near Gadhejalgaon phata, at 3am on Friday.

According to the Karmad police ( Aurangabad rural), the victims were returning from Igatpuri after paying obeisance at a temple. The injured, including a woman, are battling for life at different hospitals.

The victims were heading from Aurangabad in the jeeb when the driver, who probably could not spot the heavy vehicle parked on the left side of the road, crashed into it.

The deceased were identified as Kashinath Devrao Mehtre (62), Ravi Baban Jadhav (32), both hailing from Nasirabad of Sindhkhedraja; Sangita Ganesh Bunde (45) of Tandulwadi, also in Sindhkedraja; and Rushidhar Devrao Tidke (55) of Gondegaon in Jalna.

Karnad police said they have registered an offence and that a probe is on to ascertain facts. “Depending on the findings, a charge sheet would be filed.”

On December 25 last year, a major accident had occurred on the same highway that connects Nagpur with Mumbai.

Five of a family were then killed after a speeding car lost control and hit the divider before turning turtle and ending up ramming an autorickshaw coming from the opposite direction.

The accidents have raised questions over measures to control speeding and haphazard parking on the busy highway.

PUNE: Fergusson College ’s management on Friday constituted a committee to inquire into a second-year political science student’s allegation of being beaten up inside the institute by some students , who he claimed represented the Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP).

“On Wednesday, there was a pro-Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) event on the campus. I asked the organizers if they had the permission to conduct the event. This led to an altercation and I was beaten up. I have registered a non-cognizable offence against them. One of them is a college student and the other one is an ‘outsider’. Both of them belong to the ABVP,” Santosh Rasve said while addressing a news conference.

“The college authorities can check the CCTV camera footage and take action. They have not yet urged the police to take cognizance of the matter or conduct any inquiry,” he said.

Sharad Kunte, chairman of the Governing Body and Council of the Deccan Education Society, said, “The allegations are baseless. We treat all students equally. This is a place to study and we do not give permission for any political activity on the campus.”

Fergusson College principal Ravindrasinh Pardeshi said, “We are formulating a committee to inquire into the issue. We will also look at the CCTV camera footage. Students who are at fault will be punished.”

“We treat all students alike. We want the students to maintain peace on the educational campus,” he added.

HYDERABAD: On the lines of TS-iPass determining industrial policy of Telangana , the government is planning to roll out TS-bPass for quick approval of building plans and self-certification. The government will also come out with new parking policy to address the problem of parking space shortage.

On Friday, municipal administration minister KT Rama Rao said the much-awaited Metro rail service on Jubilee Bus Station to Mahatma Gandhi Bus Terminal would be inaugurated within a week. “In next few days, the Metro rail corridor will be thrown open for commuters, after which Hyderabad will be second largest city in India, after Delhi, in terms of Metro rail connectivity,” he said, after inaugurating Credai property show.

He said the government’s aim is to ensure that people get building approvals in a time-bound manner and in a corruption-free environment. “The way TS iPAss has become a role model, TS bPass will also become a role model in the country,” he said. KTR had earlier said TS-bPass would allow a citizen to construct a house through self-certification if dwelling unit is to be built within 75 square yards.

He appealed to builders, developers and real estate promoters to look beyond Hyderabad so that tier-II and tier-III cities would also develop. “We will provide the required infrastructure.” On investments on infrastructure projects, he said capital infusion should be a continuous process.

KTR said the government is planning to develop a IT hub towards Pet Basheerabad and Kompally in the north of the city. “IT sector is presently concentrated in western parts. We want it to grow in all four corners of the capital.”

He also appealed to the developers and builders to hire good consultants and designers so that aesthetic and beautiful designs are given to the façade and elevation of buildings. “I had gone to Mangaluru and was impressed with the designs there. Stop building routine (dabba-type) buildings. You are constructing structures that would be dotting the landscape for a long time. They must have good designs,” he said.

“Some people have been trying to spread fear among public by circulating fake information about coronavirus. So we decided to issue an alert. The cyber wing of the city police is also on alert and any complaint regarding fake news will be dealt with seriously,” police said.

Meanwhile, the state police have also issued a circular warning social media users from spreading fake news as incidents of forging letterheads of medical officers were reported during Nipah outbreak in 2018. Police have urged social media users to stop forwarding messages without verifying its credibility. “We are planning to book people for spreading such messages.” an officer said.

More than 12 people were booked for circulating messages to create public scare during Nipah outbreak. The move was well-received by public. The propagation of fake messages over hartals was also stopped by enforcing strict action.

“Some people have been trying to spread fear by circulating fake news. Messages are being circulating saying a person from a particular area has been infected with coronavirus. Their motive is to create panic among people,” a police officer said. “So far we have not received any written complaint against fake news. However, we will keep vigil and ensure action against those trying to create fear among people,” he added.

Haridwar: A 28-year-old man lost his life after the auto he was travelling in allegedly colliding with a swamp deer (barasingha) in Sector 1 of BHEL, Haridwar, and turned turtle on Wednesday night. This was followed by a rare incident in which, a biker was gored by the deer. He suffered stitches on the chest and was rushed to the nearest hospital along with the injured auto-driver.

BHEL area shares boundary with Rajaji Tiger Reserve (RTR) from where animals often come into the BHEL residential area and get into conflict with humans.

Big bushes around the area and unkempt solid waste have also turned the area into a perfect habitat for wild animals of Rajaji, which further leads to such incidents. Recently a man-eater leopard had to be killed after it had taken refuge in BHELs unkempt forest.

Confirming the incident, inspector of Ranipur police station Shankar Singh Bisht said, “Ravindera Agrawal (28) died after the auto collided with the deer while another person Chandra Prakash, a resident of BHEL Sector – V was gored by the same animal. He suffered five stitches as the barasingha attacked the victim by its horns.”

Meanwhile, Haridwar DFO Akash Verma said that it is not possible for the swamp deer to attack anyone as it is a very shy animal and never in the past any such case has been reported.

“It is a strange story being cooked-up by the people. According to eye witnesses, the auto driver had applied breaks suddenly while the biker was speeding and they both collided.”

Sighting of swamp deer in BHEL area and in fact other areas of Haridwar is quite common. Recently, the animal was seen entering Roshanabad court premises while earlier it had entered former Haridwar DM’s house, from where it was rescued by forest officials after hours.

COIMBATORE: As many as 13 out of the 35 micro composting centres in the city have started functioning and the corporation has assured to put the remaining centres to use before the end of March, chairperson of the regional monitoring committee (south) of the National Green Tribunal (NGT) P Jyothimani said here on Friday.

Speaking to reporters after a review meeting with corporation officials, the official said that the city generates 1,000 tonnes of waste a day. “Of that, 60% is compostable. Adopting the decentralized concept to treat compostable waste, the corporation had decided to construct as many as 69 micro composting centres in the city,” he said.

Talking about the opposition from public on constructing the centres at open space reserve (OSR) sites, Jyothimani said it could not be avoided as there is not enough space in the city for building the structures. “The centres will not cause discomfort as they will not produce bad odour as widely believed.”

Decentralized waste treatment is considered as one of the best solid waste management methods and Tamil Nadu is the first state to implement it, the official said. “After it was implemented in the state, local bodies in Bihar are planning to adopt the method.”

Speaking about the lakhs of tonnes of legacy waste at the Vellalore dump yard, he said that the corporation has assured to scientifically dispose the waste accumulated at the yard through biomining process within 24 months once the work begins. “Rs 65 crore was allotted for implementing the process. The corporation will float a tender to identify a suitable bidder to implement biomining process in February. Professor Kurian Joseph of Anna university will certify the process.”

He visited the dump yard and listened to the grievances of people living around the place, Jyothimani said. “I told them that the problems they face will be solved once the biomining process begins.”

It was the third review meeting conducted by the committee in the city after NGT directed the corporation to scientifically dispose 15.50 lakh cubic metres of accumulated solid wastes at the dump yard in October 2018.

COIMBATORE: A person with learning difficulties , who had scaled the pillar of Valankulam flyover between Ukkadam and Sungam, was rescued by fire and rescue services personnel on Thursday.

The man, in his early 30s, was sent to a home for mentally ill in the city. Fire and rescue services personnel said that he stay put in the small space atop the pillar underneath the span of the bridge for the past two days.

“The pillar must be at least 20 feet high. Nobody knew how he scaled up that height,’’ said an officer from fire and rescue services. Officials presume that he must have got there when a vehicle was stationed close-by. He was lying there atop the pillar in a small space.

Motorists who passed by the way noticed him and asked him to get down. But he was neither able to scale further to the bridge nor get down. Since the public felt that the man could jump down and injure himself, they informed the fire service personnel. Once down, they gave him food and water. But the man was incoherent and was unable to give his identity. Subsequently, he was sent to the home.

224,['1/02/2020'],No maulana helped Muslims like Modi did: RSS leader Indresh Kumar,"This story is from February 1, 2020

yyyyyyyyyyyyyy

Dehradun: While speaking at an event held to spread awareness regarding the Citizenship Ammendment Act (CAA), Indresh Kumar, head of Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh’s Muslim wing, said that the amendment doesn’t threaten citizenship of any Muslim and that the community must not get misguided by “Jamia professors”.

The seminar, held at Dehradun Municipal Corporation’s town hall on Friday, was attended by several people from the minority community. Kumar, who spoke for over 40 minutes, accused the Congress and other Left parties of inciting violence in the name of the Act.

“When Prime Minister Narendra Modi assumed office in 2014, some people claimed that Muslim colonies will be destroyed and they will be deprived of jobs and other facilities. Today, six years have passed and nothing bad has happened to Muslims. In fact, Muslims were given gas connection and other facilities. No maulana has ever helped Muslims like Modi has. The fear being spread in the name of CAA is ridiculous and wrong,” said Kumar.

During his speech, the right-wing leader explained the citizenship procedure followed in the counrty. “In India, citizenship is given on the basis of 11+1 rule, which means that a person has to stay as a refugee for 11 years and then on the basis of a report, he/she gets the citizenship in the 12th year. Hundreds of people have been given citizenship on the basis of this law. India has always given citizenship to the needy. Irani Muslims and Parsis, Balochs of Pakistan, Tibetans, and Sindhis, and people from other persecuted communities have been given asylum in the country. People from any religion can still apply for Indian citizenship under this 11+1 rule,” added Kumar.

Kumar also pointed out the atrocities being committed on minorities in Pakistan, saying “Minorities in Pakistan are treated as second class citizens.” He stressed that people from persecuted Muslim sects like Ahmadiyya, Shia, and others, can also apply for Indian citizenship. “The incumbent government is the only one working for minorities. Congress didn’t do anything for the upliftment of minorities in the past 70 years,” said Kumar.

He urged people to not oppose the Act and not subscribe to violence. “No one dreams in Arabic or any other foreign language. We dream in Hindustani languages because we are all Indians and no power can change it,” Kumar added.

In its statement, the society’s office bearers said that the Press Information Bureau (PIB) has released a statement recommending members of the public to use untested ayurveda, homoeopathy and unani medicines to prevent and treat the illnesses caused by coronavirus.

Even as the World Health Organisation (WHO) has only advised the public to stick to basic preventive measures like avoiding contact with people suffering from cold, washing hands, staying away from crowded places, farm or wild animals etc, Indian government after giving similar hygiene recommendations has also advised people to take to ayurvedic practices, homoeopathic drugs and unani medicines, it said.

A homeopathic drug namely Arsenicum album30, unani medicines like Sharbat Unnab and ayurvedic preparations like Shadang Paniya are advised to be taken either as preventive medicines or for symptomatic management against coronavirus infections. But there are no supporting evidence that these medicines are effective against the virus, the statement said. It further said that how are these drugs even relevant in the fight against novel coronavirus (2019-nCov), which is itself a new organism is not clear. In the absence of proper studies on the effectiveness of these medicines the government advisory on coronavirus is irresponsible, misleading, dangerous to the public health and against medical ethics, the statement said.

The coronavirus (2019-nCoV) has already claimed 132 lives. It has affected over a dozen of countries. According to the health ministry, 9,150 passengers have been screened for the coronavirus.

The sordid saga began in June 2017, when Selvaraj was arrested for the murder of G Vinodh Kumar, 36, a resident of Selvapuram and was lodged in the Coimbatore Central Prison. Selvaraj had killed Kumar as he was having an affair with his friend Gunduraja’s wife, police sources said. “Both Selvaraj and Gunduraja were arrested. When they came out on bail in September, the five convicts, who were Kumar’s friends, decided to take revenge on them,” a police officer said.

The five men began watching Selvaraj and Gunduraja and got a tip that the duo was coming to IUDC Colony in an autorickshaw on September 22. “They waylaid the auto, which only had Selvaraj. They hacked him and auto driver Anandh Kumar to death using sickles,” the officer added.

Judge T Malarvalantina also slapped them with fines ranging from Rs 11,000 to Rs 12,000.

232,['1/02/2020'],PTR seeks nod to translocate tigers living in Pilibhit’s Amaria cane fields,"This story is from February 1, 2020

BAREILLY: Pilibhit Tiger Reserve (PTR) authorities have written to principal chief conservator of forests (wildlife) for translocating tigers that have made the sugarcane fields in Amaria block home. Forest officials said 10 tigers are living amid the cane fields and fear that if the big cats are not shifted, it may lead to human-tiger conflict in the area. Of these, four are sub-adults.

According to forest officials, nearly 50 tigers, including the 10 in Amaria, are living in the cane fields in Pilibhit district .

Giving details, chief conservator of forests, Rohilkhand zone, Lalit Verma told TOI, “If our proposal is approved, it will be first time that sugarcane tigers will be translocated. However, it is yet to be decided where the tigers will be shifted.”

Though forest officials have proposed translocation of tigers, experts said tranquilizing and shifting the big cats will be a challenge. Verma said, “I will request PCCF (wildlife) to conduct a study on viable population of tigers that should remain in Pilibhit. Besides, the study should focus on the impact in the area if the tigers from sugarcane fields are translocated from there and if it will lead to a rise in population of wild boars or nilgai. Besides, we will ask senior officials to take help in the translocation process.”

Officials said tigers were first spotted in Amaria, an agriculture belt, in 2012 when a tigress with three cubs strayed there. Located about 18 km from Pilibhit Tiger Reserve (PTR) and 20 km from Surai range of Terai East forest division of Uttarakhand , Amaria’s sugarcane fields offer a perfect refuge for tigresses for breeding. The reasons: A thick cover of tall cane crop, easy availability of prey and water and complete protection from other male tigers who mostly prey on cubs to be able to mate with their mothers afresh.

It is no wonder that over the years, the number of big cats has increased here.

As the number of tigers has increased here, forest officials fear that if big cats are not shifted elsewhere, it may increase the risk of man-animal conflict. “We have adopted a few precautionary measures to minimize man-tiger conflict. Our forest staff regularly checks on Amaria. Besides, we have been conducting workshops with farmers to make them aware about living with tigers in the vicinity,” said Verma.

233,['1/02/2020'],Mela management hopeful Kumbh preparations will be completed in time,"This story is from February 1, 2020

Haridwar: The Haridwar Kumbh Mela 2021 administration said it was hopeful that the central and state government will release funds in time for completion of the event’s preparations. The Centre is yet to release funds, while the state has given a part of its share. Contractors, however, are not as upbeat and have threatened to not accept tenders in the future if the present state of affairs continues.

Mela officer Deepak Rawat told TOI on Thursday, “Government orders have been issued for 44 Kumbh works worth Rs.210 crore but the actual amount released is about Rs 80 core. Although no funds have yet been released by the Central government, we are hopeful that adequate grants, in the form of special assistance will be provided by the Centre.”

Chief minister Trivendra Singh Rawat recently met the Prime Minister in Delhi and requested Rs 1,000 crore for Kumbh preparations.

In Haridwar Kumbh of 2010, the mela administration had received a grant of Rs.594.46 crore. The Kumbh of 2021 is expected to see a footfall of 15 crore, which is five crore more than the number of devotees who visited the 2010 Kumbh. This time, the management expects a turnout of two crore on the day of “snan” alone.

Contractors said that mela works might not be completed in time due to delay in payments and low availability of construction material. “Construction of eight Ganga ghats and a few roads has already been halted by contractors,” said Contractor Welfare Association president Ved Prakash Gupta.

Gupta added that contractors had to purchase building material from Haryana and Uttar Pradesh and pay the additional price for transportation, as mining in Uttarakhand is closed most of the time. The mela officer, however, dismissed the charges and promised to allay any difficulties contractors might be facing.

234,['1/02/2020'],Govt to finally consider banana in ‘fruit’ category,"This story is from February 1, 2020

Nashik: State agriculture minister Dada Bhuse on Friday said that the government was planning to give banana the ‘ fruit ’ status so that farmers get the desired subsidy from the state government through their various schemes.

Bhuse said that many farmers were pressing the status of banana to be changed. “The district guardian minister of Jalgaon, Gulabrao Patil, during the meeting, has demanded that the government should take steps to help the banana-growers as they were suffering immensely from the lack of decision. They were not getting the subsidy given by the state government through the various schemes and hence the demand has been made,” he said.

Since 1985, the farmers have been demanding yet the governments have failed to take a step towards it. “Through our agriculture department we will ensure the justice is done to the farmers,” he further said.

The farmers are not only losing the government subsidy in the plantation of bananas but also in transportation as well. “The government also gives subsidy in exporting of the bananas by air and by ship, but the banana-growers do not get even that as the bananas are not included in the category of fruits. As a result, the farmers have to bear the plantation cost, the transportation cost and still provide the fruit at a competitive price to stand in the market,” Dnyandev Mahajan, president of ‘Mahabanana’, the Jalgaon-based state-level association of banana growers.

Mahajan also pointed out that the government has the scheme of taking up plantations of fruits through the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA) in which not only the government offers a huge subsidy but at the same time the government also has a provision of providing labour payment for the ones who are working on the scheme.

The government, on the other hand, believes that since banana plantation has to be done at the most every 2 years – as against the orchards plantation which can go up to eight to 15 years once they are planted, it would be difficult for the government to provide subsidy for the same.

Box:

The state agriculture minister Dada Bhuse said that earlier government had discriminated between Vidarbha and Rest of Maharashtra and Maha Vikas Aghadi was for the overall development of the state. “Earlier farmers from Vidarbha got special treatment for power connections, while the farmers in the other parts of the state were still waiting for power connections and hence resorting to power thefts. We are now changing the picture and ensuring that all farmers get the power connections at the earliest,” Bhuse said.

236,['1/02/2020'],Microbiologist finds link among inflammatory diseases,"This story is from February 1, 2020

Dr P Appa Rao, microbiologist

Visakhapatnam: In 1984, a general practitioner from Bobbili, Vizianagaram, Dr P Appa Rao made an important observation while treating asthmatic patients. Some asthma patients, he noted, who were treated with anti-histamine antibodies were relieved of arthritis pains, which was not why they were receiving treatment.

On applying the same treatment to arthritis patients, he observed that most of them made a full recovery.

Observations over subsequent years showed that a few patients who earlier suffered paralytic attacks, also recovered from paralysis, as well as from arthritis.

Similarly, an arthritis patient with a venous ulcer recovered from both the ulcer and arthritis.

One observation led to another and further research by Dr Appa Rao led to the discovery of a common link among all inflammatory conditions—a biological cycle that is referred to as the histamine vicious cycle.

“This hypothetical central dogma of inflammation is explained better by understanding experiential immunology. The human body has IgEb cell, which produces IgE antibodies. These IgE antibodies attach to mast cells. These mast cells liberate histamine (a chemical released by the immune system),” said Dr Rao.

A former professor at Osmania Medical College, Dr Appa Rao is currently professor and head of the department of microbiology at Andhra Medical College.

“To further explore the science behind my observation, I studied for an MD in microbiology, and undertook two trainings—one in immunology and another in rheumatology. I identified a common biological cycle in all inflammations, called histamine vicious cycle (Rao’s vicious cycle) and applied for patents for about 150 indications. This cycle has a potential role in healing or controlling many physical and psychological diseases such as depression, stress, dementia, autism, arthritis, paralysis, endocrine disorders, urinary, renal and other infections, cancer pain and certain types of cancers,” he said.

At Medical Microcon—a workshop held by AMC on Friday, Dr Appa Rao also presented case histories of many of his patients who recovered from various ailments, based on the hypothesis of a link between various inflammatory diseases .

DEHRADUN: In a major respite to the people living in the hills of Garhwal region, the government is all set to start chopper service to Gauchar in Chamoli district and to Chinyalisaur in Uttarkashi district from February 8. A chopper would take two trips a day. Rs 4,120 would be the fare for Gauchar and Rs 3,350 for Chinyalisaur.

Under the Ude Desh ka Aam Naagrik (UDAN) scheme of the Centre, CM Trivendra Singh Rawat will flag off the chopper services to the two routes — Sahastradhara-Gauchar-Sahastradhara and Sahastradhara-Chinyalisaur-Sahastradhara — from Sahastradhara helipad on February 8.

Aviation advisor to Rawat, Captain Deep Srivastava said that the chopper service is a result of the CM’s efforts. A double engine six-seater helicopter of a private firm would be used for the service.

While Chinyalisaur is around 120 km from Dehradun , Gauchar is 205 km from the state capital. It takes over five hours to reach Chinyalisaur and over seven hours to reach Gauchar, which is famous for the fair it hosts in November. With the chopper services, the journey can be reduced to a mere 30 odd minutes.

CMO sources said that the success of the heli services will motivate them to start choppers for others routes as well.

Dehradun resident Rajesh Purohit said that the chopper service was long overdue and it will be extremely helpful for the people of the two districts in case of any emergency. “Patients are either rushed to Dehradun or Rishikesh and it takes a long time to bring them. The chopper will drastically reduce the time. For others also, it will be extremely useful,” he added.

Speaking to TOI, residents who have formed an umbrella group named Samvidhan Bachao Manch said that they will collect the signature and will also prepare a memorandum explaining why the Act is discriminatory and goes against the very principles of the constitution. “We held a meeting with several residents under the banner and have decided to take the movement forward by garnering support of locals through signatures and also preparing a memorandum,” said Kailash Pandey, CPI(ML) leader.

Pandey added that the memorandum and the signatures would be addressed to the President, PM and CJI. “We want the government to know that people are against the Act as it is against the constitution and it will not be approved by the people. They should listen to the citizens and therefore should repeal the CAA and clear their stance in the NRC,” he said.

The group has also announced that it will hold camps every Saturday to procure the signatures in large numbers. “We will hold camps as well as street plays to garner support against CAA and to also inform the people on why the Act is discriminatory. These camps will be organised every Saturday starting from February 1,” said Irfan Rasool, Imam of the Badi Masjid in Haldwani.

The group had earlier held a three-day dharna in Haldwani during Republic Day which saw active participation of several women and comparisons were being drawn to the similar protest in Delhi’s Shaheen Bagh.

The Mavelikkara police said that the present union office secretary Rajesh has lodged a complaint with the police on Friday evening after Vasu and his supporters entered the office. “A case will be registered in this connection soon,” said the police.

Kollam principal sub court has ruled that Vasu and Babu could continue with the day-to-day functioning of the Yogam union committee. Principal sub-judge Doni Varghese, however, ordered that they could not take any policy decision.

The court order was on a petition filed by Vasu and Babu challenging the dissolution of their committee and the appointment of Sinil Mundappally as administrator. They have complained that no notice had been issued to them before dissolving the committee.

246,['1/02/2020'],Coronavirus scare: Crew of 3 ships denied permission to disembark at Paradip port,"This story is from February 1, 2020

Kendrapada: Paradip port authorities have since Monday refused disembarking permission to the crew members of three commercial ships that have sailed through China, Hong Kong and Singapore in the wake of the spread of novel coronavirus. Until now, the deadly disease has killed more than 200 people and infected thousands in China, leading the World Health Organisation to declare a health emergency.

On Friday, one ship was denied permission to allow its crew to disembark in Paradip. The ship is anchored 2 kilometres away from the port area. Dr Prahallad Panda, chief medical officer of Paradip Port Hospital, said, “On Monday and Thursday, crew members of two more ships were prevented from disembarking as the vessels had also anchored in countries hit by coronavirus before reaching Paradip port.”

Port authorities, though, refused to disclose the details of the ships or where they were coming from and how many crew members were present inside.

Sources said healthcare members would screen all crew members of the ships to detect if anyone is sick before deciding on whether to let them deboard. It is learnt that the process to screen the crew members could start on Saturday.

“The measure is being taken to check the spread of the deadly coronavirus that has already reached in 22 countries. Due to that we, too, are on high alert in the port area and have to examine the health of all crew members since they have sailed through the affected countries,” Dr Panda said.

“A special help desk has been set up at Paradip port on Monday to detect if anyone has been affected by coronavirus and to provide information to crew and others about the disease,” he added. An isolation ward has been set up at Paradip Port Hospital to treat any showing symptoms of the disease.

Leader of opposition in Rajya Sabha Ghulam Nabi Azad (File photo)

NEW DELHI: Opposition parties attacked the Modi government for “lowering the dignity” of the President by making him deliver a speech in which the “highly controversial and divisive” Citizenship Amendment Act was listed as among the government’s key accomplishments.

Taking turns to criticise the government over pushing a divisive and polarising agenda through the citizenship law, members of Congress, RJD and Left said the Centre lacked compassion for those demonstrating against the controversial law.

Leader of opposition in Rajya Sabha Ghulam Nabi Azad said, “Today is an unfortunate day. It is expected from the President that he will not praise the government for the problems that afflicts the county. President is the custodian of the Constitution of the country. The Constitution is being affected by the wrong law that the government passed using its majority. His address was like an insult to the scores of people protesting against CAA across India.”

His party colleague Anand Sharma slammed the government for creating fault-lines through CAA. “It is a sad day on which the President of India listed as an accomplishment the attack on the Indian Constitution through the Citizenship Amendment Act. By including the contentious law of CAA in the President’s address, the government has lowered the dignity of the office of the Rashtrapati,” he said.

CPM general secretary Sitaram Yechury echoed Congress’s views and said he was concerned about what was happening in the country. “The government has not even signalled that it wants a dialogue with people protesting against the CAA-NPR-NRC. Instead, we are seeing them resort to state-sponsored violence in front of the police,” he said, referring to the shooting at anti-CAA protesters at Jamia Millia University on Thursday.

Congress’s prime focus of criticism, however, remains NPR. This was reflected in the protests in Parliament and will follow in the coming days. The party will also brief state in-charges and MPs on NPR on February 4. The enumeration exercise is to begin across the country from April. While Congress-governed Rajasthan has announced its non-cooperation on NPR, other states where the party is in office are likely to follow suit.

CHENNAI: A Defence Security Corps guard on duty at the Heavy Vehicles Factory , Avadi, shot dead a colleague just after midnight on Thursday, police said. While the reason behind the killing is yet to be ascertained, police identified the deceased as Gargesh Kumar of Himachal Pradesh and his killer as Nilambar Sinha of Tripura.

At 12.23am, a police officer said, Gargesh Kumar, along with three others, was resting at the guard quarters when Nilambar Sinha walked in. He immediately opened fire with his 5.56 rifle, striking Gargesh multiple times on the body. The other three men immediately ran and hid under some wooden benches before alerting the seniors. Police said Nilambar fired at least seven rounds.

Soon, 10 other personnel reached the scene and surrounded Nilambar, ordering him to drop the weapon. When he complied, they brought him under their control. A police team later arrested him.

Gargesh’s body was moved to the Government Kilpauk Medical College and Hospital for autopsy. The Avadi Tank Factory police registered a case and began investigations. A senior police officer who talked to the accused said he appeared to be under depression and that it could have triggered the incident. “He [Nilambar] joined the force here only three days ago and there seems to have been no enmity between the two,” the officer said.

Personnel of the DSC, who are responsible for providing security at all defence ministry installations in the country and are drawn from various disciplines, are part of the security detail at HVF, Avadi, too.

Police said Nilambar, who was on duty between midnight and 3am, is married and has two children who live with their mother in their native Tripura.

The shooting sent shock waves among staff at the HVF campus. Officials said the place was put on high security as hundreds of defence vehicles, including Army tanks and their components, are assembled and manufactured here.

Meerut: A day after a youth opened fire at anti-CAA protesters in Delhi, BJP MLA from UP, Sangeet Som, said on Friday that people like JNU student ‘Sharjeel Imam who want to break India’ should be hanged and shot dead publicly. Imam has been booked under several cases for allegedly delivering inflammatory speeches against Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) and National Register of Citizens (NRC). He was arrested by Delhi Police from his hometown Jehanabad in Bihar on January 28.

""People like Sharjeel Imam who try to divide the country should be hanged publicly and shot dead. They should not be spared at any cost,"" the Sardhana MLA Som said. Earlier, Union minister Anurag Thakur had been censured by the Election Commission for a similar utterance during a poll rally in Delhi.

Som's remarks came during his visit to Deoband where thousands of protesters, especially women, from Muslim community have been staging protests for the past three days. The MLA claimed that these protests had been funded by political parties and foreign groups and and a thorough probe will expose the 'conspiracy' behind the protests.

""All these women sitting on dharna have no work to do. They are being funded by political parties and sponsors from abroad. They have no idea what CAA is. I believe the day these protest in Delhi, Deoband, Bareilly and Lucknow are probed, cases would be lodged against these people and they would eventually be sent to jail,"" Som said.

After April 2019 bombing of a Sri Lanka church, Som, who is also an accused in 2013 Muzaffarnagar riots, had dubbed ""burqa"" as ""symbol of terror"". “The black attire that Muslim women wear has become a symbol of terror and is responsible for hundreds of deaths in Sri Lanka,"" he had said. His comments had drawn criticism from several quarters. Later, BJP had also distanced itself from his remark.

Representative image

COIMBATORE: The Tamil Nadu Vivasaigal Sangam has petitioned the district collector seeking to stop smuggling of subsidized fertilizers from the state to Kerala.

The association has also asked the district administration to file cases against those caught transporting subsidized manure to other states under the Essential Commodities Act instead of handing them over to the civil supplies department.

Farmers suspect the fertilizers are smuggled to be sold to industries.

“In the last two months, there have been two instances of fertilizers being smuggled to Kerala – one from Coimbatore district and other from Perambalur ,” state secretary of the Tamil Nadu Vivasaigal Sangam P Kandasamy said.

“However, instead of being charged under the Essential Commodities Act, which would have resulted in a jail term, they were handed over to the civil supplies department which levies fines,” he said. “For people who smuggle for profits running into lakhs, only prison can act as a deterrent,” he added.

Farmers said that it was unfair that subsidies which the government gives, with tax payers money, is diverted towards profit making traders.

“Unsubsidized urea will not be bought by farmers even in Kerala, so the urea is being smuggled to industries which require urea, like chemical manufacturers, corroborated sheet manufacturers among others,” said the petition. “It is happening only by traders tying up with some agriculture department officials,” it added.

Farmers said that they have also written to the agriculture produce commissioner and appealed to the district collector to closely monitor subsidized fertilizer distribution in the district and its movement near the borders.

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Carnatic vocalist and social activist TM Krishna has termed the decision by Chennai-based Kalakshetra Foundation to withdraw permission for the official launch of his new book ‘Sebastian and Sons: A Brief History of Mridangam Makers’ on its premises, as extremely unfortunate.

“I believe Kalakshetra lost a wonderful opportunity to be a part of the attempt to celebrate the lives of Mridangam makers. It’s their loss,” he said here on Friday at the Ka - Mathrubhumi International Festival of Letters, the event which witnessed the release of the book.

Kalakshetra withdrew permission for the launch after Krishna published excerpts from the book, which dealt with beef-eating practices from Vedic period and the killing and skinning of cows for making Mridangams played by Brahmins. The foundation pointed out that the content of the book would instigate political, cultural and social disharmony, and asserted that as an institution under the Union ministry of culture, it has to keep away from such controversies.

However, the official launch will be held at Asian College of Journalism in Chennai at 6.45pm on February 2, said Krishna while announcing the change of the venue.

“I see this book as a celebration of people, celebration of Mridangam makers, a celebration of so many generations over decades spread across South India . It’s a complicated book. It’s going to be a book which will trouble people of privileged classes, especially Brahmins. It’s going to be uncomfortable,” he said.

“But I don’t see a problem in anything I have said in this book. These are things we need to think about. For me writing this book was also questioning myself and not just other people,” he added.

Dehradun: Authorities of Dehradun ’s one of the oldest and only girl’s college, Mahadevi Kanya Pathshala (MKP) college have issued a unique diktat for its students that states that there would be disciplinary action against them if they were found taking selfies on the terrace.

The diktat also mentions that if the students have free time, they should go to library and study. The diktat comes weeks after the higher education minister mooted an idea of conducting student poll to ban mobiles in classes.

“All students are being informed that they are requested not to climb to the terrace of the college and if any student is found taking selfi on the terrace, the college will take disciplinary action against her. Go to the library instead in spare time,” the circular reads which was issued on January 29.

While college authorities cited reason of security of students, the students feel that the circular is derogatory. The diktat has irked the students who feel that they have all the right to decide what they want to do when they are free. After drawing criticism from the students, the college authorities made correction in the circular which reads, “If anyone is found on terrace taking selfie or doing anything….,”

“Nowhere in the circular is it mentioned that the terrace is dilapidated. The circular could have clearly said that it could be risky to climb on to the terrace rather writing that don’t go there to take selfies and go to library during free time. The circular is derogatory, it seems as if all girls are taking selfies in college rather than studying,” said a final year student who did not wish to be named.

Maneesha Rana, president of MKP students union said that the college administration is thinking about the welfare of the students as girls make Tiktok videos on terrace which could turn fatal at times. “People may find the language of the circular weird but the message is correct. They should study and should never climb on to the terrace as the college building is too old and this may lead to any accident,” she added.

Talking to TOI, principal Rekha Khare said, “Our college has no boundary wall on the terrace. Students go there to take selfies and there are ample chances for mishaps. Students are unhappy with the circular as they know that they do waste time. College is a place for studies and if they want to soak in the sun, they can go to the garden.”

Bijnor: Forest officials on Friday managed to prevent farmers from killing a leopard they had spotted in a field. Though the leopard eluded capture, the foresters team set up a cage and two camera traps at Dharampura village under Haldaur police station area, 14 km from the district headquarters.

After spotting the leopard, villagers armed with lathis and sharp objects surrounded the field with the intention to kill it. The forest department arrived in the nick of time after someone informed them. They took charge of the situation.

This winter, leopard sightings have increased in Bijnor. Over the past two days, a leopard each was killed in a road and train accident. Earlier, a leopard was beaten to death by villagers after it mauled a student to death in Bijnor’s Bhogpur village in Najibabad tehsil. A few days ago, villagers had surrounded a big cat at Fatehpur Sabhachand village.

Since November 27, six people have been killed in leopard attacks in the district, instilling fear among villagers.

To prevent another ugly man-leopard confrontation, a forest team rushed to the scene and laid the net around the field where the big cat was spotted. The newly formed forest task force installed a cage and set two cameras in the area,

Despite a seven-hour operation, forest authorities failed to catch it. But they mollified the villagers.

Talking with TOI, a village elder, Dharamveer Singh, said, “Leopard fear can be seen on the faces of villagers. They will spend the whole night wide awake to detect its presence. Forest authorities must capture it.”

According to sub divisional forest officer Hari Singh, “We got a tip-off that some villagers had cornered a leopard in a sugarcane field at Dharampura village. Our team reached there and laid a net around the farm and put a cage in the field with a goat tied inside as bait to lure the big cat. Cameras were also installed. Initially, the animal was seen running from one side to another. Then, it escaped from the field under the cover of darkness. Efforts are on to catch it.”

Dehradun: Opposition Congress accused the ruling BJP of robbing local bodies of their authority after the state government moved to bring an ordinance that would enable it to shut down any slaughter house in the state. Congress contended that the state was encroaching on the municipal corporation’s department.

Congress state chief Pritam Singh said, “Finally they have taken a decision and it is against the local bodies of the state.” He also said that the move was not required.

Notably, the construction of a slaughter house in Manglaur, Haridwar district had brought the two parties at loggerheads. The project had been approved by the previous Congress government in the state, amid protests from BJP legislators like Swami Yatishwaranand and Sanjay Gupta. Congress legislators, including Qazi Nizamuddin, had supported the decision.

Commenting on similar lines, Congress vice president Surkyakant Dhasmana said, “If such acts continue, the role of civic bodies will be greatly reduced in the future. It appears to be a planned move to push the agenda of the ruling party.”

265,['1/02/2020'],Madras HC seeks government counter on plea for CBI probe into TNPSC scam,"This story is from February 1, 2020

Representative image

MADURAI: Madras high court has directed the state government to file a counter on a plea seeking CBI inquiry in the Tamil Nadu Public Service Commission (TNPSC) group IV exam scam. I Mohamed Razvi, a resident of Ramanathapuram district, stated in his petition that lakhs of candidates had appeared for the exam conducted in September 2019. After the results were published, TNPSC filed a complaint before the CB-CID director general of police on a suspicion that 99 candidates had indulged in malpractice to clear the exam.

He stated that based on the complaint, a probe was ordered by forming special teams. The CB-CID sleuths arrested a few people in this connection and found that the candidates involved had used pens with evaporative ink to mark answers which were subsequently corrected by corrupt officials. Most of the candidates involved in the malpractice appeared at select centres in Ramanathapuram district and some even secured ranks within the top 100. He submitted that if such candidates get jobs then genuine candidates would lose their opportunity to get employment. Since there were possibilities of higher officials being involved in the scam, the CB-CID, which is a state agency, would not be able to bring them under probe.

The CB-CID sleuths have arrested only some candidates and middlemen. Since only a CBI probe would ensure free and fair investigation, the petitioner moved the HC Madurai bench seeking the same. When the case was taken up for hearing on Friday, the state government submitted that the investigation was on the right track and sought time to file counter.

266,['1/02/2020'],HC dismisses plea to conduct Big Temple consecration in Tamil,"This story is from February 1, 2020

Representative image

MADURAI: Observing that no special status has been given to Sanskrit and due prominence is given to Tamil language as per agama principles as done in earlier years, the Madras high court has dismissed petitions which sought to perform the consecration ceremony of Brihadeeswara Temple (Big Temple) at Thanjavur in Tamil.

A division bench of justice M Duraiswamy and justice T Ravindran passed the order while hearing a batch of petitions seeking to conduct the consecration of the temple in Tamil. The judges observed that the petitioners have come forward with the petitions only on the ground that the ceremony which is to be held on February 5 would not be conducted in Tamil and the same would be conducted only in Sanskrit.

In the counter affidavit submitted by the Hindu religious and charitable endowments (HR&CE) department it was stated that importance is given to Tamil language in the practices adopted during the ceremony and it would be performed both in Tamil and Sanskrit as per agama dictum and as followed during the previous years.

The judges also cited that as pointed out by the temple authorities, the petitioners have not placed any reliable and convincing proof other than barely mentioning that the ceremonies have been conducted exclusively in Tamil according to the agama principles by King Raja Raja Cholan I, who had built the temple.

The judges further rejected the claim of the petitioners that the fire accident which took place during 1997 occurred only due to violation of agamas by performing the ceremony in Sanskrit, citing that there is no connection between the accident and the rituals performed at the temple.

Since it was stated in the counter that dhanam or gift is not confined to any particular community and it is distributed to all the people involved in the ceremony irrespective of caste or creed, the court does not find any infraction of the provisions of the Constitution, as alleged by the petitioners, the judges said.

“By considering the above said factual matrix, we (judges) are of the considered view and opinion that the court should be hesitant and reluctant to interfere with the religious practices, unless a strong case has been made out and established that the religious practices and functions of the temples are violative of the provisions of the Constitution,” observed the judges.

Hence, the judges dismissed the petitions and directed the authorities concerned and temple authorities to file a compliance report on the conduct of the ceremony within four weeks after the completion of the ceremony.

268,['1/02/2020'],"Maharashtra: Onion glut at Lasalgaon, 70% drop in average wholesale price","This story is from February 1, 2020

Representative image

NASHIK: The onion supply at the Agricultural Produce Market Committee (APMC) at Lasalgaon has doubled in January compared to what it was in December last year.

According to APMC officials, around 4.35 lakh quintal of onions were auctioned at Lasalgaon APMC in January against 2.37 lakh quintal auctioned in December.

The rise in supply of onions has also led to a drop in the average wholesale price of onions by almost 70%. From Rs 8,625 per quintal on December 16 last year, the average wholesale price recorded at Lasalgaon APMC on Friday was Rs 2,600.

The minimum and maximum wholesale price was recorded at Rs 1,200 and Rs 2,932 per quintal respectively. Around 22,000 quintals of onions were auctioned on Friday.

The unseasonal rainfall in October last year had badly affected the kharif onions. Fresh kharif onions usually arrive from mid-October. However, the delay in the arrival of showers during the retreat of monsoon delayed onion plantation. Moreover, 75% of the plantation had got rotten due to the continuous rains between August and September last year. This led to a shortage of onions in December last year.

However, despite all these factors, upto 45,000 hectare of area is under late kharif onion plantation as against the average plantation area of 30,000 hectare. “Usually, supply of late kharif onions begins in December. The arrival of late kharif onions was also delayed by a month. The arrival of onions began in the first week of January and the supply has now picked up at large,” said APMC officials.

In retail markets, good quality onions are being sold between Rs 30 and Rs 40 per kg.

“There had been a scarcity of onions in the last three months, which significant increased the wholesale onion prices. Onions have started arriving at the markets in almost all the onion-growing pockets in the state. The supply has increased as compared to the demand. This is the reason the wholesale onion prices have dropped significantly in the last one month,” said Bharat Dighole, president of Maharashtra Onion Growers Association.

A HALFWAY HOME IS A RESIDENCE-CUM-SKILL UPGRADATION CENTRE WHERE PROGRAMMES ARE RUN TO HELP THOSE WHO’VE RECOVERED FROM MENTAL ILLNESS IN THEIR TRANSITION TO INDEPENDENT LIVING. HERE ARE A FEW CASE STUDIES:

Ramulamma | 24 years

Sukku | 45 years

Vishnuvardhan | 49 years

Vijaya Kumari | 45 years

HYDERABAD: Yashwanth Kumar, 40, was admitted to the Institute of Mental Health Sciences at Erragadda in Hyderabad four years ago. A patient of schizophrenia , he was roaming on the streets of Khammam when police took him into custody and the district court referred him to the hospital at Erragadda.He was cured and reunited with his family in Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh, in February 2019. It wasn’t easy to trace his residential address and contact the members of his family, because Yashwant could only remember that he was from a place in Lucknow.However, not all the patients who have been treated of schizophrenia (a long-term mental disorder) are as fortunate as Yashwanth. There are about 130-odd patients, including men and women, who have been cured of their mental illness but either their families are not willing to take them back or some of them do not remember anything about their home.For such people, the Telangana government, in compliance with Supreme Court directions, is constructing a halfway home where they will be trained to help them get jobs and join the mainstream. Over three acres on Erragadda campus has been earmarked for the halfway home. The state government is set to complete its construction by this March.M Umashankar, superintendent, Institute of Mental Health and social worker Padma took special interest in tracing Yashwanth’s residential address.“We searched on Google and zeroed in on major commercial establishments and showed it to Yashwant. Finally, were able to contact his family members with the help of Lucknow police. The joy of his family members knew no bounds,” Umashankar told TOI.Yashwant was a farmer and went missing 17 years ago. His daughter was three years old when he went missing from home. She was 20 when he returned. Though cured of his mental illness, Yashwant does not remember how he reached Khammam. Doctors at the Institute of Mental Health said he could have boarded trains and got down at Khammam while he was mentally unsound.“There are several families who have refused to take back their family members though they have been cured of their mental illness. There are various reasons such as social stigma attached with the person or history of nuisance created by the patient. Some families could have moved on in life while others want to stay away from the additional responsibility of taking care of those people who have been cured. There can be various other socio-economic reasons too. We try to counsel them and send back as many as possible by reuniting them with their families,” said Umashankar.She wants to go back home and take care of her three daughters. But her husband, Ravi, an auto driver, is not willing to take her back. “If not my husband, my daughters will come for me after they grow up. I had run away as my husband used to beat,” Ramulamma said.“The Anantapur magistrate referred her to the institute in 2014, and she was cured in one-and-half-years,”said R Padma, a social worker at the institute. The hospital authorities contacted Ravi after Ramulamma gave them the name of her village in Karnataka.But Ravi doesn’t want to take her back.Guntur district court referred him to the institute in 2013 and within a year he was cured. But he only remembers that he is from Bihar. “I don’t remember anything about my family except that I don’t have parents,” he said. Doctors at the institute said Sukku takes care of other patients. Though the court ordered his rehabilitation, Sukku refused to go to any rehabilitation home.He stopped taking food and protested peacefully for 15 days till hospital authorities withdrew the plan to shift him to a rehabilitation home.He is a father of two daughters and resident of Kalwakurthy. His wife, Sharada, has stopped taking calls from the hospital authorities. He used to beat up his wife following which she had gone to the local police. When the cops took him into custody for questioning, he allegedly beat them up and escaped. “I am a changed man now. I am sure that my wife and daughters will come for me,” he said.Social worker R Padma said his wife had initially promised to take him back but now don’t take calls either.She was referred to the institute by the Kurnool district magistrate in 2013 and was cured in 2015. Now, she wants to stay with her daughter. She recalls the name of her father as Subbanna and her husband as Venkat Swamy. She also remembers that her husband is a labourer. Though not clearly, she says her son died when he was very young. However, neither does she remember the name of her village name or her state. “She helps other inmates. She suffers from mild hearing impairment,” said social worker R Padma.",hyderabad,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73834019,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-344853,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/cured-but-waiting-for-social-acceptance/articleshow/73816252.cms

Madurai: The Tamil Nadu Chamber of Commerce and Industry (TNCCI) has hailed the new direct consent to operate (CTO) scheme announced by chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswami on Friday, which enables industrial units operating under the “green category industries” (with pollution index between 21 and 40 fixed by the ministry of environment) to obtain faster clearances from the government to commence operations.

TNCCI president N Jegatheesan said that under the scheme, green industrial units will get certification of the agricultural department in 30 days and reclassification of land for industrial purposes will be completed within 50 days as against the present time frame of six months to two years sustained by the entrepreneurs for completion of such processes.

If the approval is not received within the time limit, it will be considered as deemed approval and industrial units can go ahead with the project work. This efficacious initiative will largely benefit industrial units, especially in micro, small and medium industry sector in the state.

With the country witnessing downward trend in industrial production and sliding GDP growth rate, the present initiative by the government to remove one of the main obstacles faced by the industrial entrepreneurs will go a long way in setting up of more such units and additional employment generation. He said the chief minister’s visionary outlook and proactive initiative is laudable and would benefit many.

A video grab of the BMTC bus driver manhandling the biker in Mahadevapura.

BENGALURU: Bangalore Metropolitan Transport Corporation (BMTC) on Friday suspended a Volvo bus driver after he was caught on camera repeatedly slapping a two-wheeler rider for allegedly coming in his way in Mahadevapura on Thursday.

The bus (KA 57F822) was plying on route 500D (Central Silk Board-Hebbal) when a man astride a bike (KA53 EF 7538) with a woman on the pillion allegedly moved from one edge of the road to the other, blocking the bus. The driver screamed at the two-wheeler rider and got out of the vehicle. He later slapped the biker. The man and woman were not wearing helmets.

The incident was shot by Hamid K, a passenger on the bus, who uploaded a 45-second video on Twitter. The post went viral. “This horrible incident happened today morning on my way to office dis morning. Does BMTC personnel have the rights to take law into their hands and beat up a private citizen in public? (sic),” Hamid tweeted.

In the video, Hamid is seen confronting the driver, Santosh Badiger, from Hebbal BMTC depot, over his action. In response, the driver continues his unruly behaviour and goes on to threaten the passenger. “Who are you to ask? You should speak in Kannada,” the driver is seen shouting back.

Hamid is seen replying in Kannada that he too can speak the language. Responding to Hamid, BMTC tweeted: “Regret the inconvenience caused. Taking note of this, serious action will be initiated against the erring crew (sic).”

Later, Hamid told TOI: “The two-wheeler rider didn’t overtake the bus. He crossed the road in front of the vehicle. The bus was about to move and the driver stopped it almost immediately.”

BMTC managing director C Shikha said, “The driver was a trainee. An investigation has been launched and he has been placed under suspension pending inquiry. Such incidents will be taken seriously and disciplinary action will be taken any such employees.”

However, a BMTC source said, “According to the driver, the two-wheeler rider was speeding and would have hit the bus. He was scared he may lose his job in case of an accident.”

Further, Hamid tweeted: “We need safer Bengaluru roads. Please see this incident and think about necessary corrective actions. The biker crossed over the bus. It caused the aggressive driver to stop the bus in the middle of the road and manhandle the biker. A few BMTC drivers drive as if they own the roads. Safer roads are a bigger responsibility of bigger vehicles (sic).”

Responding to a tweet, police commissioner Bhaskar Rao wrote: “This is institutional road rage, could you share location, law and order police will take immediate action.”

Participants at the nightlong protest against the Jamia firing and CAA, at Maurya Circle in Bengaluru.

BENGALURU: Two miscreants on Thursday night threatened students in the city who were protesting the firing incident near Delhi’s Jamia Millia Islamia, telling them they would meet the same fate as the injured student.

A minor had opened fire at students protesting the Citizenship (Amendment) Act near the Delhi varsity, injuring one. The Bengaluru incident took place at Maurya Circle, where the nightlong demonstration against the Jamia firing and CAA began around 7.30pm. By 11pm, the number of protesters reduced to 30 but the group decided to stay back after getting the news of another alleged attack on women and Jamia students by Delhi police.

According to Adrian, a student who was at the scene, the small group of protesters stayed within a barricaded area on the road, chanting slogans, singing patriotic songs and playing music. “While we were raising anti-CAA slogans, two men from among us began shouting pro-CAA slogans. The duo was unknown and when we looked at them, they quietly moved away,” said Adrian, adding they were drunk and returned after a few minutes.

Saqib Idrees, another student protester, said the duo began to issue verbal threats. “They threatened us in Kannada that they would repeat the Jamia incident in Bengaluru,” said Saqib, adding the duo also taunted them saying ‘it’s not CAA down down, but you all will be brought down’.

When the students questioned the miscreants, cops stationed at the spot detained the duo. “Police were very cooperative. Almost 20 personnel were with us till 5am,” said Saqib.

Meanwhile, a friend of the duo watched the drama from a distance and approached the protesters to apologise on their behalf. “He said they belonged to the working class and FIRs would destroy their lives. He apologised to us and we decided to let the matter go. After all, we are Gandhians,” added Saqib.

Adrian said though the two men were drunk, their threats exposed their ideology. After the duo was detained, the students continued their protest till 5am and dispersed after singing the national anthem.

According to High Grounds police, the men are bank employees and were detained for disturbing the protesters at Maurya Junction. “They are from Andhra Pradesh and work in a PSU bank in the city. One of them is set to get married in February. He had thrown a party for his other friends for the same reason. The duo was drunk when confronted by the protesters. We booked a case of public nuisance and let them off after a warning,” police said.

Dharwad: Many people who lined up at some of the ATM kiosks in Dharwad on Friday returned disappointed as there was no cash to dispense at these centres. Although functioning of ATM kiosks was unaffected, by and large, the lack of cash at some of the facilities was a sign of the impact that the strike called by bank employees had on everyday financial activities in the city.

The protesting employees gathered at the main branch of the State Bank of India in Dharwad and raised slogans demanding fulfillment of their demands, which include a hike of 20% on payslip components, reduction of the number of working days in a week to five, shelving of the new pension scheme and incorporation of special allowance with the basic pay.

The protesters said that they had been waiting for a hike in salary since November 2017. “But the central government has failed to respond to our demand. That is the reason we have decided to strike work to bring some pressure to bear on the Centre,” they said.

Activities at banks are expected to be affected on Saturday as well with the strike continuing for another day.

Meanwhile, in Hubballi, employees of nationalised banks gathered in front of the Union Bank of India branch near Dr BR Ambedkar Circle to protest against the central government’s failure to acknowledge and fulfill their longstanding demands. The protesting employees warned the Centre of launching a three-day stir in March and an indefinite agitation in April should their demands continue to be ignored.

Nashik: Maharashtra Natural Gas Ltd ( MNGL ) on Friday said that they will provide compressed natural gas (CNG) for 200 city buses by March-end.

According to MNGL officials, CNG stations will be operational at six locations in the city. These locations have been leased out by the Nashik Municipal Corporation ( NMC ).

MNGL’s promises came during a joint meeting of officials from MNGL and NMC. Mayor Satish Kulkarni and NMC’s standing committee chairman Uddhav Nimse were present during the meeting.

“We are launching city bus service from April 1 with 200 CNG and 50 diesel buses that will be deployed in phases. MNGL will lay 103km pipeline from Mhaskal-Titwala and has agreed to make CNG available through tankers by March-end,” said Nimse.

Initially, MNGL will transport liquefied natural gas (LNG) through tankers to the city and then convert it to CNG. LNG will be transported by roadways from the nearest import storage location (Dahej) and will be stored in containers in Nashik.

The six locations identified for the proposed CNG stations include Adgaon, NMC’s fire brigade station in Panchavati, Truck Terminus at Chehedi, Pathardi, Tapovan and Sinnar Phata. MNGL has already signed a lease agreement with the NMC for first four sites while agreement for the remaining two sites — Tapovan and Sinnar Phata — will be signed within a week.

The minister said that the maternity centre will continue to function at Palanganatham with the required facilities and doctor as well as nurses will be made available round the clock. Following the assurance, the people thanked the minister and corporation officials. The maternity centre has been functioning on 1.5 acres of the sprawling campus of the primary health centre. Residents said it was used by a large number of pregnant women from Palanganatham and surrounding areas. However, officials started neglecting the centre in the past two years and three months ago delivery services were stopped and shifted to Pykara a few kilometres away.

Residents say that an additional building was constructed 10 years ago at a cost of Rs 35 lakh, but it was not utilized. After the maternity and delivery services were shifted, only outpatient treatment is being provided at Palanganatham. P Jothibasu, 50, who spearheaded the cause for the last one month, said, “At Palanganatham, the centre had bigger space and was easily accessed by a large number of people. There was no reason to shift it and merge with Pykara urban primary health centre.”

A former functionary of CPM, Jothibasu had quit the party recently after its leaders did not take up the issue when he approached them, said Jothibasu, who was born at the maternity centre. The corporation commissioner told TOI that medical services will continue at the centre. The required man power will be deployed and adequate drugs stocked, he said.

292,['1/02/2020'],City to get a public garden bigger than Central Park,"This story is from February 1, 2020

Jaipur: The residents of Jaipur will soon have another public garden, 10 acres larger than the present Central Park. The park will come up on the 52.42 acre land in the middle of VT Road and Aravali Marg, constructed under the Mansarovar scheme by Rajasthan Housing Board.

This new park has been named as ‘City Park’ and CM Ashok Gehlot has already given his assent for the project.

The work orders will be issued soon. Central park is constructed on 42 acre land but the new ‘City Park’ will be bigger in area and will have more facilities for the residents.

Commissioner Rajasthan Housing Board Pawan Arora said that they are targeting to have green cover in major portion of the park. “We have planned to develop this park based on public gardens in developed countries. We want citizens to have a personal experience when they visit the park.

This will not just be a park for morning exercises, but there would be recreational facilities and interactive features for the people. There will be a children’s park, a food court, juice centre and other facilities. Almost 90% of the park area will have green cover,” said Arora.

He further said that the plantation for the park will begin this monsoon but other construction will take some time.

“The area is identified and map is finalized. Once the DPR is prepared, tenders will be invited. It will take a year-and-a-half to complete the construction, but the plantation in the park has to be started this monsoon,” Arora added.

As per the map provided by the officials, there will be six entrance gates, five parking lots, a three-km track, national flag post, butterfly garden, haat bazaar, a lake, a pond, an open air theatre, carnival house, an outdoor gym and other facilities. There has been a confusion for a long time about the type of construction at VT Road, which has now been resolved.

A painting by Zhang Yuwei on jallikattu

MADURAI: Chinese artist Zhang Yuwei, who has captured the spirit of bull tamers with brush strokes of water colour, wishes to exhibit his illustrations of the traditional Tamil sport jallikattu to the world. Madurai Kamaraj University (MKU) is set to display 22 of his paintings permanently on its campus.

Yuwei has drawn around 30 jallikattu paintings. In January, we had invited him for an international Tamil conference organized here.

During the event, 22 of his paintings were exhibited at the university and was inaugurated by the university vice chancellor M Krishnan,” said B Sathyamoorthy, head, department of Tamilology at MKU.

“As an illustrator, I always choose themes, which are directly related to my personal artistic experience and life. I felt jallikattu’s stories are particularly suitable for illustrations and I like to choose unique themes as inspiration. I believe it is fate and destiny that I got to do these paintings and I couldn’t be happier,” said Yuwei, who is also the national curator of Watercolour Illustration Association, China.

Yuwei first came to know of Tamil Nadu and jallikattu through his colleague and friend Neelakandan, an assistant professor at Shaoguan University, who is from Madurai. “Yuwei came for my wedding in 2018, travelling for the first time to Madurai with his family. I told him about jallikattu then and he was very intrigued to witness it. This year, he came for a second trip,” said Neelakandan.

“When I first learned about it, I was overwhelmed by the bravery, excitement, speed, and strength. I did not expect that there could be such a sport in the world that could directly hit the human heart. The colours are beautiful. A thrilling display of handsome warriors and wild cattle, almost characterizing our origins,” said Yuwei, reminiscing. He also mused upon Indian and Chinese cultures, explaining the common pursuit in art.

“When it comes to countries and cultures, I think they are different only in race, colour, and language. The pursuit is the same. As long as it is beautiful, everyone in the world should know about it (jallikattu) and they should like it. China and India are both ancient civilizations with a long history. I want to express and convey my knowledge of the world through my art, and tell a story to affect more young people,” observed the artist.

Yuwei has already taken his jallikattu works to China, where he was also honoured with a national award for the paintings. He also presented a watercolour illustration exhibition about jallikattu at Bournemouth University, England.

Officials said that chief electoral officer (CEO) of Delhi Ranbir Singh and a team of election and police officials visited Shaheen Bagh on Friday, to assess the law and order situation ahead of a crucial review meeting on poll preparedness. Officials said the delegation found the situation “conducive” to conduct the polls on February 8.

“The delegation was keen to see whether there was proper access for voters to reach the polling booths since a portion of the area had been closed by the protesters. The officials found that the roads to the polling booths were not closed and the voters could easily cast their votes. Alternative routes were also identified if there was a problem later,” said an official, requesting anonymity.

Another official said there were 20 locations across the capital where anti-CAA protests had been under way, but Shaheen Bagh was the only area where a road had been blocked. “The polling booths in Shaheen Bagh were included in vulnerable locations and additional security would be deployed,” he said.

Sharad Pawar

PUNE: Former Union agriculture minister Sharad Pawar on Friday said meeting the increasing demand for sugar and dealing with uncertainty in the sector were the key challenges the sugar industry was facing.

He was speaking at the second international conference and exhibition on sustainability — innovation and diversification in sugar and allied industry. He said the estimated demand for sugar in the country by 2025 would be around 30 to 33 million tonne. “Taking into consideration the national commitment to security and requirement of land for foodgrain , there are constraints to increase the area to grow sugar cane. Thus, the demand can be met only by increasing productivity per unit of land by increasing sugar recovery,” Pawar said.

He said the stagnant yield of the sugar cane per hectare was around 70 tonne, whereas the potential yield was over 250 tonne per hectare. The industry would have to bridge this gap. The average sugar recovery was stagnant at 10.5% and it could be improved to 11.5 to 12.%. The government would have to support the researchers for developing varieties with high yield and high sugar content, Pawar said.

Jose Orive, the executive director of International Sugar Organisation (ISO) said the world market would depend on how much more India was expected to export.

The court while quashing the cognizance taken by the lower court upheld the process of allotment of land associated with the Jal Mahal Lake. The court had reserved the verdict on January 29 after the parties concluded their arguments in the case.

In the petitions on behalf of the applicants, it was said that the complainant in the case Bhagwat Gaur had filed a case alleging foul play in the tender process, while the High Court had cancelled the lease deed of the land itself.

After the trial was taken up by the lower court on the basis of the High Court's decision on September 9, 2011, the Supreme Court quashed the High Court order and considering land allocation process to be “correct”, reduced the 99-year lease to 30 years.

The bench of Justice SP Sharma was told that the allotment process of land was done with complete transparency and the firm of applicant Kothari was allotted the land as he was the highest bidder. Hearing the arguments of the parties, the single bench quashed the cognisance taken by the lower court.

The 100-acre disputed land worth around Rs 3000 crore initially belonged to the Jaipur Development Authority(JDA), Jaipur Municipal Corporation (JMC) and the Public Works Department (PWD) but was transferred to the Rajasthan Tourism Development Corporation (RTDC), which then leased it to Kothari’s M/s Jal Mahal Resorts Pvt Ltd in 2005.

Kothari issued a statement on Friday, saying, “I always had the belief that at the end truth prevails. I had to face lots of challenges while facing the court trials. Since Jal Mahal project is very close to my heart I will do my best to complete it as it is planned to augment the travel and tourism quotient of Jaipur.”

Nagpur: School Headmasters Charitable Association (SHCA) is planning to create awareness among students about the deadly coronavirus, so that they do not fall for rumours floating on social media. The association is planning to approach the Indian Medical Association (IMA) for help with expert speakers, who can provide medically correct information to students.

Zafar Khan, president of SHCA, said “Due to social media, false news spreads fast and vulnerable young minds get influenced easily. Being academicians, we are against the spread of unscientific messages that have potential to create panic among citizens. Doctors are the only qualified people to speak about this issue hence we are thinking of an initiative to make kids aware of the same.”

The IMA, which has already done a couple of workshops with SHCA, is open to suggestions on how this can be taken forward. Dr Laxmi Shrikhande, chairperson of IMA’s Adolescent Health Committee, said, “The idea sounds good and we are definitely open to having such an interaction. We look forward to meeting the principals and understanding in what format we can take this forward.”

Dilip Bose, another senior academician and office bearer of SHCA, said multiple fake news about coronavirus are spreading fast and affecting kids. “What happens is that kids panic when they hear news like mass deaths happening due to the virus and that it spreads through such and such way. And in today’s generation, what they read or see on social media is considered true by default. Recently, a WhatsApp forward said drinking cold drinks causes cancer and many took it seriously. Such myths need to be busted and with coronavirus, we need to step up our efforts,” said Bose.

Though nothing is finalized yet, some SHCA officials are thinking that a ‘master trainer’ approach would be more feasible. The draft plan is to ask IMA to conduct a myth busting seminar on coronavirus and also talk about precautions to be taken.

The women farmers have demanded that the Centre announce a minimum slab of support to farm widows (File photo)

PUNE: Women farmers across the country are hoping for a comprehensive relief and rehabilitation package in the Union Budget to be presented on Saturday.

Vidya More, a 38-year-old farm widow from Osmanabad district, said the women farmers had been putting across their demands for the last two years, but to no avail. “Why can’t they pay heed to our demands?” More asked at an event organized recently by Makaan, a Pune-based group.

The women farmers have demanded that the Centre announce a minimum slab of support to farm widows, allocate funds and reopen all pending cases, even those that were not investigated since 2010. According to them, only 20-50% of the farm suicides get official recognition and support.

While More’s husband committed suicide around eight years ago, the state government refused to recognize his death as a farm suicide as he had not taken an institutional loan, making her ineligible for the ex-gratia of Rs1 lakh. While More got the farm land transferred in her name, she failed to get the Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi (PM-Kisan) payout of Rs6,000 a year, despite having all the documents.

Seema Kulkarni, a key functionary of Makaan, said, “We strongly recommend the government announce a package for women farmers from farm suicide-affected districts,” she said. “Whatever the Centre announces, the state can add to it and follow the best practices,” she added.

The suggestions included a uniform policy across states and all departments to address farm suicides that would include tenant farmers, women farmers, farmers with non-institutional debt, streamlining data put out by the national crime records bureau in urban and rural categories and comprehensive policy specifically with reference to women farmers from the farm suicide-affected areas. The women farmers also wanted at least Rs7 lakh compensation across all states. They stated the amount should be sanctioned and transferred into the woman’s account in a time-bound manner (within three months of the farmer’s death).

AHMEDABAD: A 22-year-old sales executive from the Vadaj area of city on Friday filed an FIR at Vadaj police station, alleging that three women, including her former lover’s wife, stuffed chili powder into her private parts and assaulted her.

In her FIR, the woman stated that she worked for Girish Goswami — the husband of Janu Goswami — four years ago at a garments shop in Naranpura . During her stint there, the complainant and Girish fell in love.

The complainant and Girish had a relationship for two years after which the complainant broke it off and started working at a garments store in Vastrapur.

Two months ago, Girish called the complainant and they got talking to each other again. One month ago, Janu learned that they had patched things up and she called and threatened the complainant, the FIR states.

At around 9.45am on Thursday, when the complainant was walking to Pragatinagar from her house in Vadaj, Janu and her friend Rinka Goswami drove up on a scooter and forced her to on the vehicle between them, the FIR adds.

They took her to Janu’s place, where another friend of theirs, Thakuri Goswami, was present.

“They locked me in a room and Thakuri told Janu and Rinka to disrobe me and stuff chili powder in my private parts. Which they did. While I was screaming in pain, they shot a video on a mobile phone,” the complainant stated in the FIR.

Janu then told the complainant to pay her Rs 50 lakh, alleging that Girish had spent that sum on clothes for the complainant. Janu also threatened to throw acid on complainant’s face if she ever met Girish again, the FIR states. They later released her and she went home.

Inspector J A Rathwa of Vadaj police station said all three accused women were arrested and charged with abduction, causing hurt and criminal intimidation.

On January 17, police were informed about an altercation between security guards and children at the juvenile home in Transport Nagar area, following which policemen reached the home and severely beat up the children, Child Protection Commission Chairman Sangita Beniwal said.

She alleged that the policemen had entered the home without marking their presence in the entry register which is not allowed as per the norms. The commission subsequently formed the panel on January 19 to look into the incident. Further action will be recommended to the state government after the committee submits its report, Beniwal said. Transport Nagar SHO Gyasuddin, however, denied the allegations, saying police only spoke to children at the home.

JAIPUR: A 16-year-old girl, who was student of Class X, committed suicide by hanging herself from the ceiling in city’s Mahesh Nagar on Friday morning. The reason for the suicide is yet to be confirmed as no suicide note was found. She stayed here along with her brothers, while her parents stayed in a village in Dholpur.

The deceased has been identified as Kavita Gujjar.

Bala Ram, SHO, Mahesh Nagar police station, said, “On Friday morning, Kavita told her younger brother that she will not go to school and did not give any reason for not going. Her brother said that he will complain to their uncle who lived close by. He went to the washroom and when he came out after 15 minutes, he saw the girl hanging.”

At the time of incident, the girl was alone at home with her younger brother while the eldest sibling had gone to their village in Dholpur for his mother’s surgery.

“The reason for the suicide is still not clear and it could be due to academic pressure or possibly she got agitated when her younger sibling questioned her about not going to school. We checked everywhere but found no suicide note. The family could not shed any light as to why she took her own life. We will question them further to see if we can find any reason,” added the official.

The girl’s post-mortem was done and the body handed over to the family.

This comes just a day after a 16-year-old girl allegedly jumped to death from terrace of her apartment in Udaipur on Thursday evening.

The girl Shodashi Patel, daughter of Milind Patel, was a student of DPS School here who was also enrolled in a coaching institute in Kota for medical entrance. She had come home few days back for some examination.

318,['1/02/2020'],"Fasting for 47 days, woman seer picked from Matri Sadan","This story is from February 1, 2020

Haridwar: In a high-voltage drama that unfolded at Matri Sadan on Thursday night, woman seer Padmavati, who had been on an indefinite fast for the cause of ‘Clean Ganga’ for over 40 days, was lifted forcibly by the police and admitted to Doon medical college hospital amid tight security. The seer refused to take any medical treatment at the hospital and all her vitals were reported to be normal. Thereafter, she was sent back to Matri Sadan late on Friday and she reached the ashram safely.

Another Ganga crusader and Matri Sadan seer Aatmabodhanand sat on hunger strike beginning on Friday in her place. Aatmabodhanand had earlier last year concluded his 194-day-long hunger strike on May 4 after getting assurance from the National Mission for Clean Ganga director that all the demands of professor GD Agrawal would be met.

Padmavati who had reportedly been fasting for 47 days looked stable while she was being taken into an ambulance. The seer refused a stretcher or wheelchair and walked till the ambulance. “I urge all Indians to help me get justice. I am absolutely fit. I will also be killed like professor GD Agrawal. The state administration is after my life,” Padmavati alleged while she was being taken in the ambulance.

“The act of lifting a woman seer from her tapasya at night is violation of the Supreme Court order which prohibits police from picking up a woman post sunset or before sunrise. A case has been registered by us at Haridwar CJM’s court on Friday. Padmavati is fit. She didn’t cause damage to anyone and was peacefully sitting on a protest inside Matri Sadan, when she was forcibly lifted by police,” said Matri Sadan seer Brahamachari Dayanand.

“It was not an arrest, the seer was shifted. It was a combined operation by the district administration, chief medical officer’s team and police. The seer’s reports stated that she needed medical attention else it could be life threatening for her. To save her, we had moved the seer from Matri Sadan to the hospital. After getting district magistrate’s order as per protocol, the seer was taken to the hospital for medical attention in the presence of the entire team,” said Haridwar SSP S Senthil Avoodai Krishnaraj.

Dr KK Tamta, medical superintendent of Doon hospital, said, “Her vitals are stable. She refused to take drip or any kind of treatment and also refused to give blood sample for tests. Though her urine test report is normal, ketones are negative, so the physician who was seeing her has recommended her discharge.” On January 25, seers of Matri Sadan had expressed apprehension of a conspiracy by the state government to end the ongoing fast-unto-death by its woman seer Padmavati by using force and a possible attempt to kill her as well as the ashram chief Swami Shivanad Saraswati.

JAIPUR: There was no respite from shivering cold for the third consecutive day on Friday when majority of the places witnessed its temperatures below the normal notch. Fatehpur ( Sikar ) remained coldest in the state where a minimum temperature of 1.6 degree Celsius was recorded, the Met reports said.

Attributing the continued dip in the mercury to the active northerly winds and vanishing of factors like western disturbances and upper air cyclonic circulation, Jaipur Meteorological office said that minor respite from the shivering cold would be witnessed in the coming days.

People in Jaipur woke up to another chilly morning as a minimum temperature of 8.1 degree Celsius was recorded in the city. In the past three days, Jaipur had witnessed a dip of almost 4 degree Celsius in its minimum temperatures. Due to the revival of the cold wave in past three days, the roads witnessed an empty look during early morning and late evening hours. People were confined to their homes while the footfall at city’s parks was also been affected. Since no fog and mist were witnessed in and around the city, the air, road and rail traffic from Jaipur were smooth.

Many places witnessed its minimum temperatures below 5 degree Celsius which affected normal life. Mild fog in the morning in the districts including Sikar, Churu, Sriganganagar and Bikaner also affected the road traffic on the national and state highways connecting these districts.

Fatehpur (Sikar) was followed by Sikar where a minimum temperature of 2.5 degree Celsius was recorded, Sriganganagar 5 degree Celsius , Churu 5.2 degree Celsius, Pilani 5.9 degree Celsius, Udaipur 6.2 degree Celsius, Kota and Bikaner 7.8 degree Celsius each, Ajmer 8.3 degree Celsius and a minimum temperature of Jaisalmer 8.9 degree Celsius, Jodhpur 9.2 degree Celsius and a minimum temperature of 9.5 degree Celsius were recorded in Barmer .

Though majority of the places in the state witnessed its minimum temperatures below 10 degree Celsius, the Jaipur Met office said that due to the active western disturbances and upper air cyclonic circulation, the temperatures will start dipping from Sunday onwards. There is likely a rise of almost 4 degree Celsius in the minimum and maximum temperatures across the state in the next 48 hours.

NEW DELHI: Calling Delhi a “family of two crore people” of which he is the “elder son”, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal urged people to vote for AAP if they wanted the water-electricity subsidies to continue.

Complete coverage on Delhi elections

“BJP has come out with its manifesto and they have not promised free electricity. If you vote for BJP, you will have to pay these bills. Their manifesto also does not have free bus rides for women. Till Arvind Kejriwal is your chief minister, all these things will be free,” he said at Chandrawal in the Chandni Chowk constituency.

“Kejriwal is zero without you; nobody knew me five years ago. You have put me on this chair and I am like your elder son,” the AAP convener told the crowd. “For the first time in the history of Delhi, all these parties have come together with just one goal — defeat Kejriwal. (Uttar Pradesh CM) Yogiji will be here on Saturday. Instead of sorting out problems in their own states, they have come here to attacks us,” he added.

The chief minister said his parents had been deeply hurt by BJP calling him a terrorist. “I gave up everything to take part in the anti-corruption movement. Despite being diabetic, I sat on a hunger strike for 15 days. If you think I am a terrorist, don’t vote for us.”

Kejriwal promised that he would take a dip in the clean Yamuna in the next five years. AAP will also ensure a complete clean-up and beautification of Delhi, he claimed. “There are garbage dumps and open drains everywhere. We will force the corporations to work,” he said. The government will buy 11,000 buses and after deploying marshals, it will do so in all colonies and mohallas, he added.

Terming the education sector revival as unprecedented in India’s history, Kejriwal said, “No state has been able to ensure 96% results. When (BJP’s) Amit Shah attacks our schools, he attacks their hard work. Abuse me but don’t say anything about our kids, parents, teachers.”

Reacting to the manifesto comment, Delhi BJP president Manoj Tiwari said the existing free schemes would continue.

Spot where accident took place

AHMEDABAD: Two construction labourers , who had no safety gear, got buried and died on Friday afternoon while laying the drainage line for AMC near Motera cricket stadium. Ahead of the inauguration of the world-class cricket stadium, the AMC has begun rushed development of basic amenities around it, and preliminary investigation by police suggests work safety protocol was not followed.

When questioned about the negligence, DCP Zone-2, Dharmendra Shrama said that he was unaware of all facts and just knew that two labourers had died at the AMC’s drainage line construction work.

The two construction labourers who died were Pravin Kumar, 27, and Gautak Kumar, 45. Both stayed near Motera and hail from Rajasthan, said inspector B K Gamar of Chandkheda police.

“The work of laying drainage line was going on between Asaram Ashram crossroads and Sardar Patel stadium where a JCB machine was being used to dig out the soil,” said Gamar.

He said the pipes were being laid at a depth of nearly 10 feet. The labourers fell in the pit and a pile of mud fell on them.

An official of Ahmedabad Fire and Emergency Services (AFES) said that the incident took place at around 3.15pm. “It took around half an hour to dig them out and then they were taken to a nearby hospital by ambulance,” said the official.

Gamar said that the two were declared brought dead at the hospital after which a case of accidental death was registered.

There will be private investment. We will only facilitate them by creating infrastructure like jetties. The heritage clock tower and Indenture Museum are attractions for people. Our aim is to develop a river cruise terminal by repairing the existing jetty at the Indenture Memorial. There are also some old Tea Transit (TT) sheds that we will revamp to create space for private operators to set up restaurants, amusement parks or other attractions. Plots will be let out on lease,” said Vinit Kumar, chairman, SPMPT.According to Kumar, there can be an amphitheatre along with gardens and fountains to attract both city residents and tourists. The idea is to throw open the city’s riverfront to all, ensuring them leisure and entertainment in a safe environment.“The location is also close to the heart of the city. People can move through Hastings and then cross the swing-bridge to reach the spot. There is also tremendous potential for cruise tourism along the river.

NEW DELHI: Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Friday disparaged a Pakistan minister's calls to defeat Narendra Modi in the Delhi assembly elections , saying polls in the capital were an internal matter of India and any interference by “the biggest sponsor of terrorism” would not be tolerated.Complete coverage on Delhi elections“Narendra Modi is the Prime Minister of India. He is my PM also,” Kejriwal said on Twitter after Pakistan science and technology minister Fawad Hussain Chaudhry’s tweet started receiving vitriolic response. “The Delhi elections are an internal affair of the country and we cannot tolerate the interference of the biggest sponsor of terrorism. However hard Pakistan may try, it cannot attack the unity of the country.”Chaudhry had posted a tweet saying, “People of India must defeat #Modimadness. Under pressure to lose another State Elections (Delhi on Feb 8th), he resorts to ridiculous claims and threats endangering Region, Mr Modi has lost balance after internal and external reaction to Kashmir, Citizenship laws and failing economy (sic).”PM Imran Khan’s minister has always been a controversial politician, according to reports from Pakistan. Earlier this month, Mubahsar Luqman, a TV anchor, filed a police report against Chaudhry for slapping him at a wedding of a provincial minister’s son. He had similarly slapped journalist Sami Ibrahim at a wedding in June last yearThe mischievous tweet came at a time when references to Pakistan, Shaheen Bagh, and the ‘goli maro’ remarks of a minister have roiled the city’s political air. In such an atmosphere, allegations and counter-allegations are flying thick, and political parties are taking to issues and narratives normally not associated with assembly polls.Manoj Tiwari, Delhi BJP chief, said, “Pakistan’s support for Kejriwal, who is the supporter of the tukde-tukde gang, is a matter of concern.

Kolhapur: The Kolhapur district consumer redressal forum on Thursday sentenced a builder to two years simple imprisonment and imposed a fine of Rs 10,000 for failing to hand over three bungalows to two customers as per the agreement.

In addition, the forum has also asked the builder to pay compensation of Rs 50,000 to each of the two customers, who had filed the complaint.

Pushpanjali Amol Patil, a resident of Mahadik Colony, had approached the consumer forum in 2014 against builder Sunil Shamrao Tate, alleging that he had not completed the construction of two bungalows as per the agreement signed between them. Patil had booked two bungalows at Mauje Nerli in June 2013 and paid Rs five lakh to Tate.

In its order then, the consumer forum had ordered Tate to complete the construction, give occupancy certificate and other legal documents to Patil. However, Tate failed to carry out the order.

At the same time, another woman, Usha Kishor Shingare, lodged a similar complaint with the forum against Tate regarding non-delivery of one bungalow she had booked. The forum had issued similar orders to Tate in this case too. The forum had asked Tate to complete the formality within 30 days.

When Tate failed to comply with the consumer forum’s orders, the two filed fresh complaints against him for failing to execute the forum’s order under section 27 of Consumer Protection Act in January 2016. Combining the two complaints, the forum held Tate guilty in both the cases and ordered two years simple imprisonment. The forum also imposed a fine of Rs 10,000 on him.

BOX: 15k complaints addressed

Kolhapur district consumer redressal forum has addressed 15,467 of the 16,777 complaints it has received till date. Savita Bhosale, chairperson of the forum, said the forum is authorized to handle cases up from Rs 10 to Rs 25 lakh. She said the complainant is not needed to deploy a lawyer as per the provisions of Consumer Protection Act. Forum can handle criminal and civic recovery

Kolhapur: Three-members of Bishnoi gang , who were injured in the police encounter at Kini toll plaza will be booked under Maharashtra Control of Organized Crime Act ( MCOCA ) by the Kolhapur police.

District superintendent of police Abhinav Deshmukh said that he had sent a proposal recommending MCOCA against three-gang members to special inspector general (Kolhapur Range) Suhas Warke. The trio are likely to be sent to either city’s Kalamba or Pune’s Yerwada jail. The police further said that as many as 19 members of the gang are likely to face stringent MCOCA, police said.

Police sources said that the gang is facing as many as 48 serious cases like murder, extortion, kidnapping, and robbery in Rajasthan. Further investigations are being done to check if the gang had any connections with the Maharashtra underworld. “Preliminary investigation has revealed that Bishnoi had some connections with criminals and interests in running a gas agency and material shops in Nashik and Pune,” said a police source.

Shravankumari Bishoni, who was admitted to Chhatrapati Pramilaraje Hospital after the encounter, was discharged on Friday and will be produced before the court on Saturday. He had sustained bullet injuries to leg during the encounter. A team of Rajasthan police is camping in the city and coordinating with Kolhapur police for the investigation.

337,['1/02/2020'],Rajasthan expects Nirmala Sitharaman to provide relief to micro and small enterprises,"This story is from February 1, 2020

Nirmala Sitharaman

JAIPUR: At a time when the insecurity of job losses is rising, economy is showing no signs of revival and the industry, especially the micro and small enterprises , has scaled down operations in the absence of credit and demand, people have a long-list of expectations from the budget and the urgency is hard to miss. TOI spoke to cross sections of people in the state to understand what they expect from finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman , who will present the Union Budget on Saturday.

Job losses have become the most worrying concern. Many said they don’t know when they will be in the line of fire. “The reality of losing one’s job has become so immediate that every single bad news about the economy shakes your existence,” said Sameer Vyas, who works in the beleaguered telecom sector. Sameer’s fear is not misplaced given the hard times the employers are negotiating to keep themselves floating. “When big companies announce job cuts, they grab headlines. But thousands of micro and small entreprises have silently been letting people go. They cannot operate at an optimum level because they have neither the working capital nor demand for their products,” said Suresh Agarwal, president of Federation of Rajasthan Trade and Industry (FORTI).

Agarwal said credit to MSMEs has dried up because their loans have been classified as NPAs. “We want the finance minister to redefine NPAs for MSMEs and increase the repayment limit from current 90 days to 1 year as a temporary relief. This will hugely benefit MSMEs. If the government can waive off farm loans, delaying the repayments to banks by the MSMEs should not be such a big issue and what it will do is huge, saving thousands of jobs,” added Agarwal.

Given the fact that the fault lines of the economy are so glaring and diverse, the suggestions were equally passionate and plenty. “There is a need to enhance priority sector lending target for micro enterprises from current 7.5% of adjusted net bank credit to at least 12%. Rajasthan’s industry mostly revolves round MSMEs and they are in urgent need of support,” said Atul Sharma, director, FICCI-Rajasthan.

Shrinking demand has been identified as one of the reasons for economy losing growth momentum. Anand Mishra, chairman, CII-Rajasthan, said that if people have disposable income in their hands, they will be able to spend which in turn will spur demand. “We are hopeful that personal income tax rates should be reduced which will lead to household savings. We suggest that tax litigations must be reduced. Investment in infrastructure sector will lead to government spending and this will bring money in the market leading to boost in economy,” added Anand Mishra.

Similarly, there is also a feeling that real estate industry holds the key to any growth revival. Digvijay Dhabriya, chairman of PHDCCI-Rajasthan said, “Any growth revival hinges on the recovery of real estate industry. The budget needs to give stimulus to the sector. Besides, the auto sector is also critical to the recovery of economy. We hope the finance minister puts money where the mouth is.”

Representative image

JAIPUR: As the Rajasthan High Court gave directions on Thursday that lotteries drawn to reserve seats of the panchayat bodies, ahead of the elections to the remaining ones, ‘should not be given effect without seeking prior permission from it’, the state commission (SEC) will put forward its position before the court on February 3, with panchayati raj department urging it to “present its case strongly before the court and get immunisation in the matter.”

The high court in its order stated, “The plea raised that the said exercise is required for determination of the fact that qua how many panchayats there will be variation in the reservation, is also spacious, in as much as, the said calculation without even drawing the lottery could be made and a decision in this regard could always be taken by the government/election commission.” “However, as the election commission has not responded to the above aspect and the version of the election commission on the entire circumstance is necessary, list the petitions on February 3,” it said.

“In the meanwhile, if any lotteries are drawn by the respondents pursuant to the order dated, January 24, the same shall remain subject to the final outcome of the present writ petition and shall not be given effect without prior permission of the court,” the court said.

Petitioner Vijay Singh had challenged the initiation of lottery schedule in the state. The panchayati raj department had written to the district collectors on January 24 directing them to complete the process of delimitation (wards and other bodies) and to conduct lotteries to reserve seats of sarpanch, ward panch, zila parishad members/pradhans and members of panchayat samitis at the earliest and also asked the districts to send final reports to the state election commission (SEC) and the panchayati raj department before February 5. It also stated that lotteries shall be conducted again in all the panchayat samitis that were affected by notifications issued on December 1 and 12.

The panchayati raj department wrote to the commission (SEC) on January 31 and urged it to “present its case strongly before the court and get immunisation in the matter. An election commission official said, “The commission will put forward its position before the court on February 3 stating that, “It will take a decision on polling (in the remaining panchayat bodies) and other issues related to elections only after receiving information with regard to ward determination and lotteries conducted to reserve seats from the panchayati raj department.”

The SEC also urged the panchayati raj department to send information regarding ward determination and reservation of seats by 5 pm on February 6. “The state election commission will clarify its position on February 3. After that the court may modify its order,” said an official.

Another official said, “When the matter is pending in the Supreme Court, the high court should not have passed this order.”

PUDUCHERRY: Jawahar Navodaya Vidyalaya (JNV), Puducherry, an autonomous institution under the Union ministry of human resources development maintained its impressive track record in cracking one of the toughest entrance examinations JEE-IIT.

This year, all 31 students from JNV cleared the JEE-IIT main examination and have qualified for the advanced examination.

A jubilant JNV principal P Ramachandran said 25 of the 31 students scored above 90 percentile in the exam. Aprameya Girish Hebbar of Karnataka, who joined the JNV in Class XI stood first in the school in the examination securing 99.83 percentile.

“I take this opportunity to congratulate and appreciate all the students and teaching and non-teaching faculty members on their achievement. The students must now take the JEE-IIT advanced exam in the same spirit and clear it and prove themselves as the best among the best,” said Ramachandran.

Last year too all the students cleared the main exam. All 23 students in 2018, 20 out of 21 in 2017 and all 23 students in 2016 cleared the JEE-IIT main exam.

Ramachandran, students and teaching and non-teaching staff members attributed the achievement to the training extended by Avanti Fellows, a non-government organisation established by former Indian Institute of Technology students Akshay Saxena and Krishna Ramkumar.

Ramachandran said Avanti in collaboration with five or six JNVs, including Puducherry, has been offering two-year online coaching classes for the students. “Everyday, subject experts from Avanti will offer online training from 11.30am to 12.30pm to help them crack the exam. Apart from the online training, mentors from IIT, Madras, will visit the residential school during weekends and motivate the students,” he said.

Each mentor will interact with a batch of four to six students on all Saturdays and Sundays and clarify their doubts besides giving them vital tips for faring well in the exam.

Protesters at Clock Tower

LUCKNOW:Barely 20 days after their release on bail, senior lawyer and Rihai Manch president Mohammed Shoaib and poet-activist Deepak Kabir, were booked again on Friday by Thakurganj police for participating in anti-CAA protest.

Thakurganj police lodged an FIR against 14 named persons, including Shoaib and Kabir, and 100 unidentified people for taking out a candlelight march in violation of prohibitory orders on January 30.

Police arrested seven named accused from Clock Tower in Hussainabad early Friday. They were identified as Mohammed Tahir, Jugnu Qureshi, Mohammed Shaan Khan, Rehbar, Dawood, Shavez and Tufail.

All accused were charged with rioting, danger and obstruction to public passage, assault on a public servant to deter him from discharge of duty and entering a prohibited area.

Additional deputy commissioner of police (west zone) Vikas Chandra Tripathi said, “The arrested persons were trying to vitiate the atmosphere where women were protesting peacefully. On January 30, the named persons reached Clock Tower and distributed candles while instigating protestors against CAA and proposed NRC.”

The officer said despite several reminders about prohibitory orders, the protestors continued to stage sit-in.

So far, Lucknow police has registered eight FIRs since the beginning of anti-CAA protests from January 18 in which around 1,000 people have been booked.

Rubbishing claims of the police, Mohammed Shoaib said protestors only paid obeisance to Mahatma Gandhi by lighting a candle.

“Nobody took out a march or held protest. We rather observed silence. Cops are trying to divert the issue and create fear among women protestors by lodging FIR,” he said.

Mohammed Shoaib and Deepak Kabir were arrested in December for their alleged role in violence during anti-CAA protests.

341,['1/02/2020'],"Nirbhaya case: Safeguards, laxity extend wait for justice","This is for the second time that the execution of the death warrants has been deferred.

(The victim's identity has not been revealed to protect her privacy as per Supreme Court directives on cases related to sexual assault)

NEW DELHI: A trial court’s decision on Friday to postpone, “till further orders”, the execution of the Nirbhaya convicts underlines how safeguards introduced by Supreme Court rulings expanding death penalty jurisprudence can be exploited. The dilly dallying by Tihar administration, experts say, is by no means any less responsible for the delay.As far back as 1982, the apex court had acted to prevent “judicial vagaries” in imposing death sentence. In the Harbans Singh vs State of UP case, the court ruled that till the time the convicts exhausted all their legal options, none would be hanged. The court inserted the protection after it emerged in this case that one convict was executed, but a second person was awarded life imprisonment even as the third was set to be hanged.This ruling is reflected in Delhi’s revised jail manual as Rule 854, and was cited by the convicts’ lawyers on Saturday in the trial court, which postponed their execution indefinitely, giving the condemned prisoners a reprieve for the second time in two weeks. Going by the strategic manner in which the four men have exploited loopholes to file mercy, curative and review pleas in close succession, such dilatory tactics may well push the date of execution to March or beyond, since two of the men are yet to file a mercy plea.This is for the second time that the execution of the death warrants has been deferred. The first order, issued on January 7 for January 22, was stayed on January 17. The second warrant, issued on January 17, for February 1, was stayed on Friday.A 2014 ruling by Supreme Court on capital punishment in the Shatrughan Chauhan vs Union of India case also figures as a major factor in deferment of the death warrant. It provides a 14-day window to a condemned person to make “peace with God” and accept his fate, after the rejection of mercy by President. In Mukesh Singh’s case, President Ram Nath Kovind rejected his mercy plea on January 17, well before the scheduled hanging date of January 22. Yet, the Tihar administration expressed its helplessness in carrying out the sentence as that would have breached SC’s mandate.There is, however, merit in the allegations that the jail administration failed to act quickly in July 2018, once Supreme Court dismissed the review plea of three convicts. With the judicial process having got over, experts said that it was when the jail and the trial court concerned could have gone ahead and issued a death warrant. “The process of availing the remedies would have started after July 2018 itself. The prosecution sat for almost two years in carrying out a sentence confirmed by all levels of the judicial hierarchy. There is no rule that says that a death warrant can’t be issued before filing of the mercy plea. After all, the situation remained unchanged between July 2018 and January 7 this year,” a senior judge said.Interestingly, the jail administration changed its stance on Saturday and challenged the application for a stay, arguing that the death-row convicts could be hanged separately. Earlier, before Delhi high court , it had conceded that the rules forbade separate execution of the convicts sentenced to death in the same case.The trial court, however, rejected this argument and partially agreed with advocate AP Singh, the counsel for the three convicts — Pawan, Vinay and Akshay — that their legal remedies were yet to be exhausted.In Video: Nirbhaya case: Delhi court stays hanging of convicts till further orders",delhi,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73823917,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-23731,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/safeguards-laxity-extend-wait-for-justice/articleshow/73818215.cms

343,['1/02/2020'],Activists term dvpt approval at Jayprabha site ‘illegal’,"This story is from February 1, 2020

Kolhapur: A delegation of film activists and corporators on Friday claimed that the approval given to develop the open space of Jayprabha Studio is illegal.

The delegation led by activist Sanjay Patil and senior corporator Surekha Shah met additional commissioner Nitin Desai terming that the city heritage conservation committee (HCC) to a private developer is wrong.

Patil and Shah stated that a resolution has been accepted by the Kolhapur Municipal Corporation (KMC) to declare the studio and the site as grade 3 heritage building and accordingly it has been included in the heritage site list. They claimed that even the Bombay High Court has given the verdict that the site is a heritage structure. The studio is owned by veteran singer Lata Mangeshkar.

Patil said that the report given by the HCC is wrong. “They have ignored that the site is declared as a heritage of grade 2. A developer has approached the town planning department seeking development permission on the site of the studio. We allege that the members of the committee and the officials of the department have nexus with the developers. They all are trying to sell the land keeping everyone in dark. We demand that as per the development plan, the site should be developed into a garden and no non-film activities are permitted in there.”

Senior corporator Bhupal Shete claimed that the developer has sought Rs 21 crore from the KMC if the land is to be kept undeveloped. “After our opposition, the civic administration is considering various ways to save the land of 3.5 acres. As per the law, the developer cannot develop anything on the land. We will oppose any proposal which will be brought before us in the general body meeting which will lead to encroachment on the site declared as heritage one,” said Shete.

The activists threatened to hold the street agitations if the KMC’s GB approves the proposal which is at present before civic chief Mallinath Kalshetti for consideration. The town planning department can table the proposal in the GB only after Kalshetti’s approval.

Kolhapur: The festival of rays ( Kirnotsav ) started from Friday, saw sun rays covering entire Mahalaxmi idol in its full glory at 6.17 pm at the temple.

The festival witnesses sun rays falling directly on the deity’s idol at the time of sunset. This phenomenon takes place twice a year -- between November 9 and 11 and between January 31 and February 2.

Milind Karanjkar, associate professor of astrophysics at the city-based Vivekanand College, who has undertaken a study of sun rays, its intensity and possible hurdles, said the idol saw ray intensity of around 35 lux in the sanctorum, which was more than enough to cover the deity’s idol. The minimum intensity requirement is at least 15 lux.

“There were no pollutants or cloud cover, which would obstruct the rays. Hence, the festival witnessed one of the most beautiful views on Friday. The illegal constructions and obstacles removed consistently by the Pashcim Maharashtra Devsthan Samiti (PMDS) and the Kolhapur Municipal Corporation (KMC) played an important role,” he said.

According to the PMDS officials, for the devotees’ convenience, LED screens have been installed at the Mahalaxmi temple premises, which will function throughout the festival. Hundreds of devotees witnessed the event live in the temple premises on Friday.

It has to be noted that hundreds of devotees crowd the temple to get a glimpse of the architectural marvel, where rays steadily reach the sanctorum of the temple on particular days of the year. The festival is celebrated when the sun rays fall directly on the deity’s idol at the time of sunset.

345,['1/02/2020'],Karnataka braces for likely cut in share of central taxes,"This story is from February 1, 2020

Representative image

BENGALURU: There are strong indications that the 15th Finance Commission will reduce states’ share of tax devolution, a prospect that would adversely hit Karnataka, which is already reeling from a shortfall in central grants due to the state.

State finance department sources say, due to the economic slowdown, there is a strong likelihood of the 15th Finance Commission headed by NK Singh, recommending a drastic cut in states’ share from the divisible pool of taxes. The panel’s recommendations are applicable for the next five years beginning 2020-21.

While the exact percentage decrease is unknown, sources say devolution is expected to decrease by 6% — from 42% to 36%. This will have serious consequences on growth in the state as it will lose about Rs 30,000 crore over the next five years.

It may be recalled that the 14th Finance Commission had increased tax devolution to states from the central divisible pool from 32% to 42% for the five-year period 2015-2020. As a result, Karnataka, which had a 4.7% share in the divisible pool of Rs 39.5 lakh crore — the total tax collected by the Centre — receivable Rs 1.9 lakh crore.

""The irony is that Karnataka, despite its good performance on the economic front and achieving targets on tax collections, is poised to suffer a fund crunch,"" said a senior finance department official. ""Since the shortfall will be felt over the next five years, we will have to make corresponding cuts in expenditure. Both welfare schemes and developmental works are bound to suffer.""

The 15th Finance Commission has already submitted its first report to the Centre and it is expected to be tabled in the Lok Sabha during the budget session that began on Friday. ""The commission’s job is only to make recommendations. It is up to the central government to accept or disregard it,"" said Kota Ravi, joint secretary of the 15t Finance Commission, while declining comment further on the issue.

Domain experts and economists also pointed out that projected GDP growth of

6%- 6.5% in the economic survey presented on Friday may do more harm than good for the state. ""Anything between 4.5 % and 5 % would have been realistic. Considering this, the total amount of the divisible pool of taxes is expected to be way below what is expected and the cut in devolution would be an added problem. The state will suffer,"" said BDA Satya Babu Bose, executive director of Budget Centre and Governance Accountability.

M Govinda Rao, member of 14th Finance Commission and a member of the advisory council of the 15th Finance Commission, said he fears growth estimation may lead to conflict between the Centre and states in the next five years.

""Both the Centre and states must rely on realistic estimates when they prepare their budgets. While overestimates are reasons for the current shortfall, the reports about reduction in tax devolution are worrisome as it would add to the crisis,"" said Rao. ""I hope [Union finance minister] Nirmala Sitaraman addresses these issues in her budget on Saturday.""

NEW DELHI: Nirbhaya’s mother , Asha Devi , broke down after a trial court on Friday deferred the execution of the four convicts till further orders. She said the courts were destroying the trust that she had reposed in them over the years. “I don’t have a big problem with the hanging date being postponed, but I have a problem with how the lawyer of the convicts behaved with me today after the order was passed. He challenged me and said, ‘yeh faansi anantkal ke liye tal gayi (this hanging has been delayed till eternity)’,” a tearful Devi told TOI.Devi said she wanted the courts, Delhi government and the Centre to see what had transpired on Friday. “Day after day, they make us face the rapists. I am in court since 10am. If all they had to do was postpone the hanging, then what was the need for them to keep us waiting? They could have just told us what the order would be so that we could have gone home. We have been waiting for justice for seven years. And above all this, their lawyer challenged us openly,” she said.Devi accused the governments of giving the convicts a chance to exploit the loopholes in the system.“All this because they are men.

LUCKNOW: A 41-year-old man has died of swine flu in Uttar Pradesh — the first death from the deadly H1N1 virus in the state this year. The patient from Gorakhpur died while undergoing treatment in Lucknow on January 24, but the death was confirmed seven days later on Friday.

Ironically, the patient’s report for H1N1 confirmation came on the day he died while undergoing treatment for bilateral pneumonia at a private medical facility in Lucknow.

The death was confirmed by the swine flu control unit in Lucknow district. “We have sent a letter to Gorakhpur health department to register the death in their records as swine flu death of that district,” said in-charge, swine flu control unit, Lucknow district , Dr Manoj Yadav.

However, joint director communicable diseases Dr Vikas Singhal said, they were yet to receive a death audit of the patient.

“There has been no swine flu death so far and we are yet to receive an audit of the Gorakhpur patient. If that is true, this will be UP’s first swine flu death this year,” Dr Singhal said. The patient was admitted at a private hospital in Gorakhpur on January 16 after he complained of fever and breathing problems. As his condition deteriorated, doctors referred him to KGMU, but he was put on ventilator at a private hospital in Mahanagar area on January 22.

Director of the private hospital, Dr BP Singh told TOI, “Patient came to us with bilateral pneumonia— an infection of both lungs. His condition was critical since the tiny air sacs in lungs were filled with fluid and puss. We tried to stabilize him, but his condition kept deteriorating.”

“Simultaneously, we also sent the patient’s blood samples to PGI’s lab for swine flu testing. As per the report received on January 22, he tested H1N1 positive,” he added.

Meanwhile, a second positive case of swine flu was reported in Lucknow on Friday. The patient is a seven-year-old girl from Daliganj area of Lucknow. The girl had visited the KGMU OPD following flu-like symptoms on Thursday and was detected with swine flu. A pregnant woman had also tested positive to the deadly virus in the city last month.

Ahmedabad: Vadaj police on Thursday filed a complaint of molestation against a 40-year-old schoolteacher for allegedly molesting an 11-year-old Class VII student, at the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) School No. 3 on Tuesday.

In his FIR with Vadaj police, the victim’s father states that the accused, Ashwin Patel, used to pass lewd comments about his daughter and he had earlier made a representation to the school principal, Malti Patel.

Rather than acting against the teacher, Malti told the victim’s father to take his daughter and enrol her in some private school. The victim’s father then told Malti to issue his daughter’s leaving certificate, but she told him that she could not do so during the academic year.

On Tuesday, the girl told her father that Ashwin had molested her during the recess and had bitten her cheek. “On Tuesday, Ashwin had been sent to a primary teachers’ training programme. As it was his birthday, he went to the school to give the children sweets. When he found girl alone during the recess period, he molested her,” the father stated.

Though the girl was scared as Ashwin had allegedly threatened to kill her parents, she still told them about the incident. Her father then raised the issue with Malti, but she still did not act against Ashwin, the FIR states.

A Vadaj police official said the schoolteacher was charged with molestation, causing hurt and criminal intimidation, along with charges under the POCSO (Protection of Children from Sexual Offences) Act. Ashwin is at large.

KOLKATA: Baren Gayen, caretaker of the apartment , where the 34-year-old Sandhya Maloo had allegedly murdered her two-month-old son, has been let off after questioning but kept “under scrutiny”.

Police sources said there was discrepancy in the caretaker’s statements. Initially, he had claimed that he was cooking at the rear end of the house and had not seen the woman dump the baby’s body in the manhole near the main gate of the apartment. Later, Gayen changed his statement, saying that he was present near the spot but had not seen the woman with the baby’s body. The police have also completed interrogating Sandhya Maloo’s family members in the past 48 hours.

“We have recorded the formal statements of her husband Sudarshan, father-in-law Hemant and mother-in-law Madhu. There were certain issues, for which we needed clarity. We could not speak at length initially as they were in extreme shock. Madhu has hinted that Sandhya had been avoiding to attend to her daughter in the past couple of weeks before the crime. We will now speak to the two lone residents of the apartment, who were in their flats at the time of the crime,” said a police officer.

Police sources said that the forensic experts, who recreated the scene of the crime, have also sent some clarifications. “We will reply to the queries. The chargesheet will focus only on the murder — the scene of the crime and the fact that Sandhya was the only one inside the house at that point of time. The forensic reports are expected to be prepared in the next few weeks,” said the officer. Police sources said that Sandhya has all along been a soft spoken person. “She has clamoured up and psychiatrists have asked us to ensure that she relaxes a bit. Then, she might open up more. We are seeking expert opinion and asking the family to explain what financial constraint (a claim of the family) led her to abort her child two months ago. We will speak to the doctors who have treated her. We have allowed her to interact with her eight-year-old son a couple of times,” said the police.

Madras high court

CHENNAI: It is unfortunate that three former judges of the Madras high court participated in a ‘ protest ’ organised on Thursday inside the court premises without permission, the first bench of the high court said while requesting the security committee of the court to take up the issue urgently.

The issue pertains to a ‘peace rally ’ organised by a group of advocates on January 30 on the occasion of Mahatma Gandhi’s death anniversary, which is observed as Martyrs Day. Though the advocates called it a peace march, the deputy commissioner of police, high court security, in his report to the registrar-general of the court, termed it as ‘unauthorised assembly and procession’.

“On January 30, at 10.30am a group of advocates including Vaigai, Sudha, Subha, Girirajan, Milton, Bharathi, Parivendhar and retired high court judges Justice Haribaranthaman, Justice Kannan and Justice Akbar Ali assembled near Aavin parlour, walked in procession to North Gate via Kuralagam, reached B2 Esplanade Gate, entered inside and finished at Dr Ambedkar statue. They were stopped and advised for their unauthorized activities. But they refused to listen to the police officers who were on duty,” the report said.

Referring to the report, the first bench of Chief Justice A P Sahi and Justice Subramonium Prasad said: “Having noticed the report, what is of more concern is that the incident involves and names three former high court judges of having entered the premises and joined the protest that was going on.”

The gravity of the incident, therefore, puts on guard the entire judicial system, as this may have a large impact on the future security measures that may be required to be undertaken by the high court. The incident, therefore, requires an immediate concern to be taken up on the administrative side, it said, adding: “We, therefore, request the security committee of the court to take up the matter urgently along with its suggestions and report the matter back for taking appropriate action on the judicial side or otherwise by the next date fixed.”

The bench issued the directions while hearing the suo motu plea initiated a few years ago for providing Central Industrial Security Force protection to the court premises.

351,['1/02/2020'],99% data migration done: SUK,"This story is from February 1, 2020

Kolhapur: The Shivaji University, Kolhapur ( SUK ) on Friday claimed that 99% migration of students’ data has been completed.

Earlier, during the senate meeting, it was revealed that academic details of students that were available with Maharashtra Knowledge Corporation Limited (MKCL) have been migrated back to university systems.

“There have been more than 2.5 crore entries related to the academics from the year 2007 to 2015 with the MKCL. The exam-related work from the said period was then managed by the MKCL, but from 2015 onwards, the university has taken over the work with the help of its IT cell,” GR Palase, acting director of Board of Examinations and Evaluation at SUK, said.

Notably, the university after taking over the exam work had to face many issues in data migration which often resulted in glitches and pending results for many students. And the data was migrated gradually over a period of four years.

“When data of some students could not be fetched resulting in withholding of their result, the university managed to get their data from various sources including their college and MKCL authorities,” an official from the varsity said.

“Such students were often given provisional admission until their data was fetched. With the migration of the data now, it won’t pose many issues to the university or the students,” he added.

Another SUK official said that the university has decided to take over the exam-related work as the issues with the MKCL were on the rise back then in 2015. The senate information stated that information verification was done by the IT department.

The Shivaji University, Kolhapur (SUK) is one of the prominent state universities in South-western Maharashtra with 293 affiliated colleges across Sangli, Satara, and Kolhapur districts.

Urbanisation in the state stood at 48.5% in 2010 and it only grows with each passing day

CHENNAI: In a bid to better public transport, the state transport department has embarked on a study to understand the status of urban transport with the support of private experts. It comes against the backdrop of transportation demand being largely met through private modes, leading to slowing vehicle movement speed and higher travel time.

The state has been witnessing rapid urbanisation in recent decades resulting in high travel demand and rapid growth of private transport modes. The consultant has been engaged to look into increasing share of private vehicles, falling share of public transport, inadequate/ unsafe last mile connectivity and pedestrian/ non-motorised transport infrastructure to provide better services to commuters. In Chennai, the average vehicle movement speed fell from 30kmph to 19kmph from 1993 to 2017, and even peripheral roads suffer. “The primary purpose of the government is to promote public transport in a big way. The survey is going to give a bird’s eye view on the status of transportation. It will tell us about the areas where we do well and the ones where we need to do better,” transport secretary B Chandra Mohan said. The report will be available in a few months.

Urbanisation in the state stood at 48.5% in 2010 and it only grows with each passing day. More private vehicles in Chennai have resulted in fatal accidents increasing from 582 in 2009 to 1,264 in 2017, and total accidents from 5,060 in 2009 to 7,257 in 2017, sources said. Improper planning of public transport services, operational inadequacies, lack of funding, government-related issues and institutional capacity are some of the reasons attributed to slow growth of public transport. With the STUs in the red, the state could not replace 4,646 over-aged buses until September 2019. The plan is to induct 2,000 new buses by March.

Increasing urban population leads to greater stress on urban transport, but the transport department data suggests there is a declining trend in MTC’s daily ridership – from 0.55 crore in 2011 to 0.49 crore in 2016. With 25% of its input, transport sector is a major contributor to air pollution in Chennai. “Chennai’s Streets for People initiative to improve walking and cycling, and the recent influx of city buses are welcome steps to improve the mobility of people. However, steps must be taken to discourage the use of personal motor vehicles,” says Shreya Gadapalli, South Asia programme lead of Institute for Transportation and Development Policy.

Nashik: Commissioner of police Vishwas Nangare-Patil said on Thursday that a police team, with a special inspector and 15 personnel, would be deployed at the Dwarka Chowk — one of the busiest junctions in the city — for a week to streamline traffic.

Speaking to mediapersons, Nangare-Patil said, “Police have already issued notifications banning the passage of heavy vehicles in Dwarka Chowk to streamline traffic. We have now asked private tour operators not to stop their buses at Dwarka junction at any cost and instead, use the space near Kannamwar bridge or Tapovan to pick up or drop passengers.”

Deputy commissioner of traffic Pournima Choughule-Shringi said, “There are many notifications which have already been announced by the police. Now, they will be put in practice.”

Choughule said that there would be one police unit manning the chowk from 6am to 3pm. Another team of police personnel would be deployed from 3pm till midnight.

The police personnel will use ropes and barricades to prevent pedestrians from walking on the chowk and ask them to use the underground crossing constructed by the National Highway Authority of India (NHAI).

Police have already readied the pedestrian underpass and put in place bright lights. The underpass too will be patrolled by the police as well as some NHAI officials.

About reviving the notifications that were issued earlier, police said that vehicles would be allowed to ply only one-way on the service roads leading to and coming out of Dwarka.

“There’s no question of two-way traffic on the service roads. Even smaller vehicles will not be allowed in the opposite direction on the service roads,” said police.

Kolhapur: The officials of the civic boy observed a no vehicle day on Friday, the last day of the month.

Since the last month, the Kolhapur Municipal Corporation (KMC) has started observing the no vehicle day on the last day of every month.

The officials and the corporators do not use the officials or private vehicles. They travel either by Kolhapur Municipal Transport buses or auto-rickshaw. The chowk of the KMC, Vitthal Ramji Shinde Chowk, is congested at all time. The officials residing in the same localities shared an auto-rickshaw and those residing nearby preferred to walk to the office.

A senior KMC official requesting anonymity said, “The decision was taken to increase environmental awareness among the people. The order is issued to every department a week before the day. We have put up the boards across the city appealing to the citizens to participate in the initiative. It will help reduce the pollution caused by vehicles and reduce congestion. At the same time, it will help increase the revenue of the KMT buses.”

The official said that at present, not many citizens are participating in the drive. However, he said it is just the beginning and the awareness is being created slowly.

A senior official said in coming days, the number of meetings will be held with citizens forum and an appeal will be made to make this initiative a mass movement.

“After discussing with them, we will roll out the plan to get them involved in the initiative through several means. Sharing the auto-rickshaws or providing a separate bus to them can be the ideas that can be used to make the no vehicle day a mass movement. We are also going to study the initiatives adopted in other cities as well,” said another senior official of KMC.

AHMEDABAD: Four of a family, including an alleged woman loan shark was arrested by Gomtipur police after a post office employee Mahendra Parmar, 52, of Gomtipur, lodged an FIR against them. Mahendra accused his distant niece, Gita Parmar, her husband Vasant Parmar, Gita’s sister Rekha Parmar and one Jitu Parmar of abduction, criminal intimidation, extortion and abetment.

He stated in the FIR that his niece was into illegal moneylending business. According to the FIR, Mahendra, who works at the parcel office in Shahibaug, had twice taken Rs 1 lakh from Gita — once during Mahendra’s daughter’s wedding and the next time for house repairs. Allegedly, Gita had lent the money at 5% monthly interest to Mahendra. The loans were taken in January 2019 with condition of repayment within six months.

After paying two instalments of Rs 5,000 each, Mahendra stopped further payment due to his poor financial condition. Thus Gita often came to his house to ask for the money, and then being thwarted, began threatening him for the money.

The accused told Mahendra that he should transfer his house to their name if he was unable to repay the money he had borrowed.

Mahendra has stated that fed up with their harassment, he had locked his house and gone to live in Odhav on rent.

Mahendra has alleged in the FIR that on January 29, 2020, when he was at his office in Shahibaugh , Gita called up on his boss’s phone. “According to the FIR she threatened Mahendra that if he didn’t come out of the office and met them they would come in. Mahendra told them that he would come out and meet them at 8.30pm during recess,” said inspector Chirag Tandel of Gomtipur.

When Mahendra came out, Gita and her associates compelled him to sit in an autorickshaw and took him to Gita’s house. “Mahendra has alleged that he was forced to sign a paper promising that he will transfer his house to Gita’s name if he didn’t pay back the loans within a month,” said a police official.

After Mahendra was released by the accused, he called up Rajnikant, his brother. “Rajnikant called the police control room. Based on that we lodged an FIR under sections 365,384,506(2) and 114 of IPC and have arrested all four,” Tandel said.

Bengaluru: In huge relief for Prajwal Revanna , Hassan MP , the Karnataka high court dismissed another petition questioning his election. The petition was dismissed on technical grounds on Friday and comes just weeks after the court had dismissed an election petition filed by A Manju, the defeated BJP candidate.

Justice John Michael Cunha dismissed the petition filed by G Devarajegowda, a voter from Hassan constituency, observing that the petitioner has not complied with the mandatory procedure prescribed under section 81(3) of the Representation of People Act, 1951. The section deals with attesting annexures appended to the petition.

Justice Cunha noted that non-attested annexures cannot be relied on by the court while framing issues against the returned candidate. He said the court cannot proceed further as section 86 mandates dismissal of a petition which does not comply with provisions of section 81 of the Act within the scheduled 45 days. Incidentally, Deverajegowda had rectified the omissions/defects after filling the petition.

Devarajegowda had contended that Prajwal was involved in corrupt practice and hence the 6,76,606 votes he received should be declared as improper reception and void and BJP candidate A Manju should be declared elected.

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: A three-year-old boy died tragically after allegedly being knocked down by a SUV driven by his own father. The unfortunate incident happened at Thottavarambu under Palode police station limits. Vaibhav , son of Santhosh and Shari of Santhosh Bhavan, Thottavarambu is the deceased. The police booked Santhosh under Section 304A of IPC for causing death by negligence.

According to police, the accident occurred around 8.30am on Friday. Santhosh, who is a driver by profession, was returning home after a short trip in his Mahindra Jeep when the toddler ran in front of the vehicle and was knocked down. The child was first rushed to the district taluk hospital at Nedumangad from where he was referred to SAT Hospital for Women and Children inside Thiruvananthapuram Government Medical College Hospital complex. But, Vaibhav died around 11am.

Vaibhav, the younger of the two sons of Santhosh and Shari, was allegedly suffering from speech impairment. On Friday morning, Santhosh and Shari were supposed to take him to a doctor for consultation for the same. In the morning, Santhosh went out of home telling Shari to be ready so that they could leave for the doctor’s clinic as soon as he returned after his trip.

Additional sub-inspector M Hussain of Palode police station said that Santhosh’s residence was located beside an inclined road. He was coming down the slope in his SUV when the child ran in front of the vehicle.

“We suspect that the child tripped and fell down in front of vehicle and Santhosh didn’t see him. He continued driving forward and stopped the vehicle hearing the child screaming in pain,” Hussain said. The child suffered serious injuries on head, face, and chest. The surgeons, who conducted the postmortem examination told the police that the injury on the chest could be the reason for death, the ASI added.

Santhosh’s neighbour Saju told TOI that before entering the sloped road to his house, Santhosh had stopped his vehicle to speak to Saju on the main road. Saju too did not see the child outside when they were speaking.

“The child might have run in from the left side of the road, where the house is located and hence, he must have been in the blind spot of the driver,” Saju said adding that Vaibhav usually had the habit of running out of the house to receive his father whenever the latter came home from work.

Body of Vaibhav was handed over to relatives after postmortem. Vaibhav has an elder brother, Vaishnav, aged nine.

The elevated road, a Rs 12 crore project, will be ready by December

PANAJI: While the Kadamba bypass may have helped decongest the route leading towards Old Goa , traffic coming from the bypass hits a bottleneck where the road ends, at an intersection at the Haat Katro Khambo at Old Goa. To get rid of this bottleneck, PWD has taken up construction of a half kilometre long elevated road at this junction.

The six-lane elevated road will begin near the Sunshine School and will land near ICAR. It will be constructed at a cost of around Rs 12 crore and will be ready by December 2020, PWD principal chief engineer Uttam Parsekar said.

This intersection has one road that leads towards Ponda , one to the Karmali railway station, while the third road goes towards the Old Goa heritage complex.

To further ease traffic congestion in the vicinity, Parsekar said a vehicular underpass is also in the process of being constructed near Kadamba Fern. This underpass will serve as a service road for those living in the new and growing residential colonies and schools at Bainguinim.

Another congested intersection is the point where the Kadamba bypass starts, on the Panaji side. Here too, an overbridge is planned connecting Chimbel to Ribandar by bypassing traffic going onto the bypass. This work, however, has remained stalled for a long time as residents of a house that needs to be demolished for the work have raised objection.

“Until the time this issue is resolved and the new structure is constructed, we have widened the road at this intersection,” Parsekar further said. The Chimbel to Ribandar overbridge will be half kilometer long and will consist of two sections of three lanes each.

Kolhapur: Taking cognisance of the request made by activists, the district collector has called a meeting with officials of Kolhapur Municipal Corporation (KMC), city traffic police, the regional traffic office (RTO) to discuss and come out with a solution to reduce traffic congestion in the city.

The meeting is going to take place on Saturday at Rajarshi Shahu Sabhagruha of district collector’s office. Civic chief Mallinath Kalshetti has been asked to attend the meeting with officials of the departments concerned.

Last week, the activists had given a petition to the district administration stating an urgent need to work out an immediate solution to reduce traffic congestion. The activists and some of the experts had suggested measures, such as moving government offices from the congesting areas to other locations. The large number visitors to these offices was leading to traffic, they felt.

The activists also maintained that there are inadequate parking places for visitors at tourist destinations in the city. “We have also suggested opening new parking lots behind Rajaram High School and shifting of Kalamba Jail to decongest internal localities. The grain traders from Lakshmipuri area too are reluctant to shift to the shops opened at Teblaiwadi. We expect all these aspects to be discussed,” said Ramesh More, one of the activists.

Desai, in his letter to the officials, states that they had received a petition which claims that around 60% of the offices built away from the congested areas are lying vacant. The petitioners have suggested that many of the government offices can be shifted to the central administrative building located along Kasba Bawda road, where the parking space is also adequately available. A sustainable solution to ease the increasing traffic chaos in the city is urgently required, the letter states.

Kolhapur: The Kolhapur Municipal Corporation (KMC) is yet to waive the property tax on houses affected by floods in August last year.

A decision to waive the property tax was taken by the civic body immediately after the floods. Civic officials had claimed that they will carry out a survey of houses affected by the floods to grant the tax waiver.

A survey was later carried out by the tehsil office and was completed in November last year and the compensation for damages was given directly to the owners. However, the property tax department is yet to crosscheck the data provided by the tehsil office.

A senior property tax official said, “We have received the data which has been forwarded to the divisional ward office for identification. The process will complete in couple of weeks. Around 60% of the task has been completed.”

Meanwhile, corporators have complained that despite the decision taken by the KMC, owners from the properties affected by floods have received the property tax bills.

According to a primary estimate, around 250 houses were completely damaged and over 300 got partially damaged. A decision was taken to waive 100% property tax for the totally damaged properties and 50% concession for partially damaged properties.

The financial year is coming to an end and the corporators claimed that they expected that bills with the concession for partially damaged properties would have been sent much earlier so that property owners could get the concession for early payment as well.

Meanwhile, the water tax department is also yet to replace the water meters and pipelines damaged in the floods. Officials claim that most of the water meters are replaced and proposal for the funds to replace the pipelines has been sent to the state government.

Chairman of standing committee Sharangdhar Deshmukh had made the suggestion to waive the property tax and water bills for one month of the flood affected citizens. “The waiver will not have major impact on KMC’s revenue. Waiving the taxes was at the top of our priority list as we don’t have any authority to give compensation of other sorts to the citizens,” he said.

KOLKATA: Smoke emission from under an air-conditioned Metro rake between the Netaji Bhavan and Rabindra Sadan stations resulted in panic among passengers on Friday evening. Railway Protection Force ( RPF ) personnel used a fire extinguisher to control the smoke at the Rabindra Sadan station. After the passengers were evacuated, the rake was sent to the carshed for inspection and necessary repairs.

“It was an older AC rake. The Dum Dum-bound train left Netaji Bhavan at 4.17pm and a passenger pulled the alarm chain inside a coach immediately after noticing the smoke. A team was waiting when the train entered the Rabindra Sadan station at 4.19pm. They boarded the coach 3414 and the passengers pointed them to a wall panel near the vestibule, behind which the smoke was emitting. While passengers were asked to vacate the coach, an RPF constable immediately picked up a fire extinguisher from inside the coach and tried to control the smoke. A decision was taken to move the empty rake to the carshed. The rake left the station at 4.27pm,” said Metro Railway CPRO, Indrani Banerjee. While some passengers claimed that they had spotted flames under the coach, the person who pulled the alarm chain told Metro staff that he had seen some sparks .

According to another Metro official, sparks are possible when there is a problem with the couplers under the vestibule. “We shall look into the matter and ensure that such incident is not repeated,” he said.

Bengaluru: Chief minister BS Yediyurappa is likely to induct 13 ministers — 10 newly elected MLAs and three old-timers — into his cabinet after finally securing the nod from BJP’s central leadership on Friday to expand his cabinet.

Though Yediyurappa said the date on which the new ministers will be sworn in will be decided in a day or two, sources say it could happen on Monday or Tuesday.

Currently, there are 18 including the chief minister in the cabinet, which has a sanctioned strength of 34. Of the 16 vacancies, Yediyurappa is expected to fill only 13, including 10 who had defected from Congress and JD(S). But sources said the possibility of inducting all 11 turncoat MLAs cannot be ruled out.

""Most of our suggestions have been accepted by the party leadership and I’m going home happy,"" Yediyurappa told reporters in Delhi, soon after his 25 minute-meeting with Union home minister Amit Shah and BJP national president JP Nadda at Parliament Complex. His younger son BY Vijayendra had accompanied him.

Except for ""one or two"", he said, most of the MLAs who won the bypolls will be made ministers, while reiterating there will be no additional deputy CMs. This could dash the hopes of Ramesh Jarkiholi and B Sriramulu, who were eyeing the post. ""If there are differences, we will discuss them in Bengaluru and finalise it,"" Yediyurappa said, anticipating a backlash.

Yediyurappa was keen on completing the expansion exercise quickly, but was left waiting for approval from BJP’s central leadership. Aspirants, meanwhile, were exerting pressure on the CM for more than a month. Opposition parties have also been critical of the BJP and Yediyurappa over the delay in expanding the cabinet, accusing him of being ""weak"".

The exercise is certain to leave several legislators unhappy. The CM will have his task cut out pacifying at least a dozen MLAs, who are hoping to make it to cabinet.

370,['1/02/2020'],Hike in standard deduction high on list of expectations,"This story is from February 1, 2020

Nagpur: On the eve of the budget, tax practitioners expressed the hope that the government eases the burden on individual tax payers, as has been done for corporates. There have been demands to increase the standard deduction from Rs40,000 at present to at least Rs75,000 and reduce the peak tax rate for individual taxpayers so that it is at par with corporate entities.

Chartered accountant Naresh Jhakotia said even as a standard deduction of Rs40,000 has been introduced the net effect comes down to only Rs5,800 as the earlier exemptions available on medical and conveyance allowance have been removed. The peak level of income tax for individual tax payers needs to be reduced to 25% as against 30% at present, he said.

Jhakotia said threshold period for tax on notional rent deemed to be received by builders on unsold units also must be extended. Under the current laws, units that remain unsold attract a tax on deemed rent after a year of construction. The tax is applicable even if the unit is not actually let out. The finance minister must either do away with the tax or at least increase the period to five years from the date of construction, he said.

Sanjay Moriani, a tax lawyer, said standard deduction should be increased to ease the salaried class’ burden as there is no scope for tax evasion. Even the deduction on interest paid on home loans should be taken to Rs4 lakh so that it matches the current rate of properties and size of loans.

Kailash Jogani, a chartered accountant and also former president of Nagpur Chamber of Commerce Limited (NCCL), said it is expected that the government will do away with the dividend distribution tax (DDT). This is because the company that pays dividend has already paid tax on that income, but again the person receiving it has to pay tax afresh.

Jogani said it is hoped that the government will also ease the penal provisions on alleged tax evasion introduced after demonetization. He said if the standard deduction is not increased, at least the rebates should be increased.

Tejindersingh Rawal, also a chartered accountant, called for removal of the tax on long-term capital gains on shares. “This has not led to any major increase in revenue. Rather the grandfathering clause introduced for calculating the loss or profit has only complicated the work,” he says.

Former chairman of Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI), Rajesh Loya said the tax rate of 20% on income of Rs10 lakh should be increased to Rs20 lakh instead. Expanding the slabs will help increase tax compliance. The 60% tax charged on unexplained cash credit and investment is too harsh. The provision introduced after note-ban continues to be applicable even today.

Mysuru: Before purchasing tickets through IRCTC, the official website of Indian Railways, it’s better to check with the National Train Enquiry System (NTES) on train timings. According to regular passengers, these websites mention different timings for at least three trains between Mysuru and Bengaluru.

The biggest worry is different timings of Talaguppa Express used extensively by tourists to reach Bengaluru to catch onward buses and trains. As per the IRCTC website, this train is scheduled to reach KSR Bengaluru City railway terminus at 10.30pm. But, as per the NTES website, it reaches the station at 10.55pm. Actually, this train reaches beyond 11.10pm.

Different timings are mentioned for Mys Udz Humsafar Express and Mailduturai Express too. All the three trains are daily express trains.

Divakar S, a regular commuter said South Western Railway authorities must clear the air. ""Talaguppa Express passengers are the worst victims. Most passengers catch this train to reach Bengaluru to catch buses, trains and flights to other destinations. But, it reaches Bengaluru way beyond the scheduled arrival time,” he said.

Shoba Sudhakar, a tourist said SWR must look into integrating details on both websites. ""NTES is a popular app among passengers. The timetables on the official websites should be the same,"" she said.

When contacted, SWR PRO E Vijaya said she would look into the issue.

Nagpur: The Union budget on February 1 is creating a buzz for the Aam Admi (common man), right from income tax slabs to managing the kitchen budget, the recent status of our GDP as well as the economy has left many citizens a worried lot. They have a long list of expectations and want the government to use this budget as an opportunity to rectify financial mistakes.

Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman is expected to announce several measures to revive the ailing economy.

Nitesh Bobde, an employee of the Food Corporation of India (Nagpur), feels that the tax structure needs to be much simpler. “There are too many complications in our tax systems. Most of our income goes in paying hefty taxes.Tax rates for income earners from 500001-1000000 should be reduced from 20% to 10%,” he said.

Vijaya Waindaskar, a local businesswoman, is concerned about farmer issues. “There is a need for innovation in the agriculture sector and those innovations would be incomplete without incorporating the warehousing sector and agricultural finance. Groceries have become extremely expensive due to less agricultural produce and lack of modernized equipment with farmers,” she said.

Kiran Mundhra, a homemaker, says, “Each time a budget is announced, people assume it to be negative, but that’s not true. There are numerous schemes available and one must make the most of them. I’m hoping that the prices of vegetables won’t touch the skies anymore.”

Poonam Khatri, another homemaker, said, “I struggle to pay for gas connections and the education fees of my children. I expect the government to plan an efficient budget for the middle-class in particular,” she said.

Sheela Khandare, an artisan residing in Vaigadpeth village, 24 kms from the city, wants the government to do something for local artisans to boost their income and exports. “We make very little money by selling pottery. The government has allocated no funds for local artisans and day by day, the cost of purchasing raw materials is increasing. The price rise affects our grocery consumption and sometimes, we have to cut down on our meals,” she said.

According to Dr Onkar Nalgundwar, the government must focus on health and women safety “More technologically advanced solutions are expected to be introduced in areas of women safety in both rural and urban areas, ” he said.

“ Medical procedures should also be made pocket-friendly for the poor, who cannot afford even a CT scan,” he added.

NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Friday agreed to examine validity of the Right to Information (Amendment) Act , 2019 which gives power to the Centre to prescribe tenure , allowances and salary of information commissioners and sought response from the Centre on a petition by Jairam Ramesh of Congress.

A bench of Justices D Y Chandrachud and K M Joseph issued notice to the Centre and asked it to file response within four weeks on the petition filed by Jairam who alleged that the new law and the RTI Term of Office, Salaries, Allowances and Other Terms and Conditions of Service Rules, 2019 “collectively violate” the fundamental right to information of all citizens.

The plea said the provision of the amended Act “alters the erstwhile fixed tenure” of five years of CICs and SICs, to a “tenure to be prescribed by the central government”. “Section 2(c) of the amendment Act grants absolute power to the central government to prescribe the salaries, allowances, and terms and conditions of service of the central information commissioners that in the pre-amended Act was fixed to be on par with election commissioners under section 13(5) of the RTI Act,” the plea said.

He said the amended Act and rules give “unbridled and uncanalised” discretionary power to the Centre which could “jeopardise the independence of information commissioners”.

The ARD order states that “It has been brought to our notice that employees loiter around leaving their office during working hours. It is the responsibility of the department’s heads/joint secretaries/deputy secretaries to ensure that the employees don't leave their seats during office hours and complete the work assigned to them.""

“If an employee leaves his office, then he/she should make an entry in the movement register and also mention the reason for going out before leaving. This should be ensured by the heads of all the departments, municipal bodies, boards and other institutions that the employees don’t leave their workplace without permission,” it added.

Additional Chief Secretary (ACS), ARD, R Venkasteswaran, said, “During the working hours (9:30 am to 6 pm), if the employees are moving out of their office, it should be known to the office and, hence, must make an entry in the movement register before leaving the office.

It is an old system. But the practice of maintaining movement register is slowly going out of fashion.”

384,['1/02/2020'],"Address climate concerns, have a green budget is demand of environmentalists","This story is from February 1, 2020

With climate change and environment degradation becoming more palpable in the country, environmentalists and wildlife conservationists have called for a ‘green budget’.

The last few budgets drew flak from experts for being rhetorical and not giving priority to the pressing issues of increasing air pollution and protection of wildlife.

The last year’s budget allocated 10% increased funds to the Union environment ministry but cut it for bio-diversity and wildlife by 10%. “While the extra allocation was used towards various initiatives from climate change point of view, other crucial areas like forests, bio-diversity and wildlife took a beating. Many state-funded wildlife sanctuaries have a perpetual fund crisis which needs to be addressed,” said Nitin Desai, Central India director of Wildlife Protection Society of India.

To have financial accountability of the benefits derived from environment, Natural Resource Accounting should be introduced in the budget. “This should be accompanied by an assessment of the loss of natural capital as a percentage of GDP. Following this, a sum at least equal to the loss of natural capital should be allocated to the environment ministry and the forest departments to enable them to repair the environmental damage,” said Debi Goenka, executive trustee of Conservation Action Trust.

Pointing out that Rs350 crores were sanctioned to tiger reserves in the last budget, assistant director of BNHS Sanjay Karkare said, “Relocation and human-free landscape continue to be big challenges. Also, small but ecologically important fauna requires huge attention, so do birds like the Great Indian Bustard, vultures and many endemic species in Himalayas.”

Karkare further added that climate change, air pollution, poor management of waste, growing water scarcity, falling groundwater tables, water pollution, and soil degradation are also major issues which need budgetary allocations.

In her maiden budget speech last year, Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman had allocated Rs460 crore for pollution control schemes including National Clean Air Programme (NCAP).

Highlighting that many cities apart from New Delhi are grappling with the crisis of air pollution, Sunil Dahiya said, “We expect that the budget provides more allocations for NCAP implementation across India. Also, coal cess which is proposed to be diluted and decreased, should instead be increased keeping in view the rising air pollution, health and climate emergency. The funds collected should be used aggressively for renewable energy infrastructure, capacity and research development.”

In the clean energy arena, the country has set an ambitious target of installing 450GW of renewables by 2030. According to Vibhuti Garg, an energy finance analyst at the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis, the government’s focus should be on creating an environment where investors’ confidence increases, and deflation in solar prices continues.

“Out of the set target, 100GW of solar is mandated to come online within next two years. The decision on imported solar panels is yet to be taken. While extending the safeguard duty and introducing new customs duty could protect Indian industry, it will be a huge setback for the solar sector due to higher price for imported solar and shortage of domestically produced solar panels,” said Garg.

Economic slowdown has provided government with an opportunity to redirect efforts in future proofing its cores. “A $5tr dollar economy, under business as usual, won’t be sustainable; it will have heavy emissions from the core sectors such as cement, steel, infrastructure. If the emissions go unabated, it will sink our economic goals before they are even afloat. Luckily, we have the technology that could reduce emissions,” said Aarti Khosla, director at Climate Trends, adding that these ambitions should be reflected in budget 2020.

Representative image

PANAJI: The high court of Bombay at Goa on Friday acquitted tiatrist Anthony Fernandes, who was charged for murdering, dismembering and trying to destroy his wife ’s body in 2016, in Margao.

The prosecution’s case was that on March 24, 2016, at 3pm at Moti Dongor in Margao, Anthony murdered his wife Fiona and in early hours of the next day chopped off her legs, packed her body along with the dismembered legs in a traveller bag. He then took it on a scooter and dumped it at the TB hospital property at Monte in Margao where he set it on fire to destroy evidence.

Anthony was convicted by the sessions court to life imprisonment.

Counsel Arun de Sa representing Anthony argued that the prosecution relied almost entirely on the evidence of the brother of the deceased, who spoke nothing about his presence at the time of the panchanama.

De Sa also argued that the prosecution, realising its predicament, applied after almost 18 months for leave to re-examine him, who then claimed to have been present at the morgue at the time of the inquest panchanama.

The court held that it was constrained to hold that “there is no legal evidence on record” to establish that the dead body was indeed that of Anthony’s wife.

“Curiously, in this case, the prosecution has failed to undertake any blood tests or DNA profiling in order to identify the body. This was easily possible and there is no explanation as to why this was not done. The two witnesses, who are alleged to have identified the dead body, were also not examined by the prosecution without there being any reasonable ground or excuse even placed on record,” the order passed by Justice Mahesh Sonak and Justice M S Jawalkar stated.

The court also found no credible material to connect the knife to the crime.

KOLKATA: The number of units registered under West Bengal Housing Industry Regulation Act (WBHIRA) has doubled in just over one year. This was disclosed on Friday by state housing minister Chandrima Bhattacharya who was the chief guest at Home Front 2020, organised by Credai Bengal in association with The Times of India . Bhattacharya said that 61,000 projects, including existing inventories and new projects, were registered under HIRA till December 31, 2018. The number of projects has jumped to 1.23 lakh by January 31, 2020.

“This is a major achievement. HIRA is the best property act in the country. It is most transparent and has instilled confidence among home buyers,” she added. Housing secretary O S Meena pointed out that registration under HIRA is no longer restricted to the project in Kolkata only.

Apart from the city, there are registrations from North 24 Parganas, South 24 Parganas, Hooghly , Howrah, Burdwan and Siliguri as well.

Meena said that under HIRA, all the problems have been resolved within the stipulated period of 60 days. There were 225 complaints, out of which 160 have been disposed.

“Most of the complaints are from old projects. The number of complaints for the projects registered under HIRA is less,” he added. Earlier, Bhattacharya had asked all the real estate developers, including the brokers, to register under the act. “Even our Housing Board is registering its projects under HIRA,” she added.

388,['1/02/2020'],No new rly projects but hike in funds expected,"This story is from February 1, 2020

Nagpur: When the Union Budget is presented a few hours later on Saturday, there are unlikely to be any detailed announcements for Indian Railways.

Only the ‘pink book’, which gives a financial overview of various works and projects, revealing the detailed allocations for various new and ongoing projects is expected.

The Economic Survey tabled in Parliament on Friday by Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman, who will present the budget, focuses on increasing freight, safety, cleanliness and sanitation. However, railway analysts and experts in the sector expect good funding for ongoing doubling, tripling and quadrupling projects around Vidarbha, a freight traffic heavy region.

“We demand 5-10% rise in funds compared to last allocation and have no idea what is going to come. As it is the railway budget has become a low-key affair after its merger with the general budget,” said railway officials.

Alok Patel, who is closely associated with railway affairs, said, “As part of the National Infrastructure Plan (NIP), the government plans to spend around Rs14 lakh crores till 2024-25. This means investment of around Rs2-3 lakh crore per year in the railway sector. We expect sufficient funds for projects in Vidarbha.”

Patel said a good part of the NIP spending will go towards funding of dedicated freight corridors (DFCs) and network capacity enhancement. A significant part will also be spent on pushing rail connectivity.

“We expect better passenger transport and amenities and strong intercity network. More needs to be done to increase speeds on existing networks as well as development of new terminals in congested cities,” said former Zonal Railway Users Consultative Committee (ZRUCC) member Pravin Dabli.

Patel hopes the budgetary focus will now continue on providing funds for existing projects. New projects are now announced throughout the year, and no longer need any mention in the Union Budget.

Three days ahead of the Budget, the Railway Board has identified six sections for high speed and semi-high-speed corridors. One of these corridors includes Mumbai-Nashik-Nagpur (753km).

Basant Shukla, founder of the Bharatiya Yatri Kendra (BYK), said, “Similar announcements to run trains at maximum speed of over 300 kmph and semi-high speed (160kmph) though are not new, the board should prepare detailed project report (DPR) in a year as promised.”

“Instead of announcing new infrastructure projects, we expect railways to focus on fast-tracking construction of third lines between Nagpur-Bilaspur, Nagpur-Ballarshah and Nagpur-Itarsi to ease congestion,” said Brijbhushan Shukla of Rail Yatri Kendra.

A section of recognized railway union leaders feared the budget would see announcements to fast-track Bibek Debroy Committee recommendations, which suggested corporatisation of the railways in 2015. “The restructuring has already started by merging cadres,” they added.

HYDERABAD: Come April 1, you may have to pay more towards taxes and registration fees. With revenues dwindling and economic slowdown impacting the state’s growth, the Telangana government is planning to jack up property tax , property registration fee and power tariff .Though the TRS government has been contemplating increasing tax and other measures to mop up revenues, it did not go ahead in view of the municipal elections. Now, with results coming in its favour, the government is likely to go for the jugular. The government often claimed that the growth was badly hit by GST and demonetisation, besides economic slowdown. The state was also undone by lack of financial support from the Centre.Chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao recently made his intentions clear to hike property tax in gram panchayats and municipalities but hastened to add that the poor would be spared. The rich and commercial establishments will have to pay more to make the urban local bodies self-reliant, he said at the presser after TRS’s win in the recent elections.In several municipalities, property tax has not been increased though there is a provision to enhance at least 5% on the existing tax every year. Nearly 70 panchayats have been upgraded to municipalities, but many of them lack basic amenities like roads and drainage facilities.The government has been planning to increase property registrations since a few months. Official sources said the hike could be a minimum of 30% and go up to 50% in some cases on the existing land value for registrations. The present rates were fixed in 2013 and have not been revised since then.A senior registration official told TOI that land rates would be revised in Hyderabad metropolitan region, cities like Warangal and Karimnagar and surrounding districts of Hyderabad where real estate has been flourishing. Chief secretary Somesh Kumar held a meeting with real estate developers and builders and informed the government’s plans to enhance the land value for registrations, the official said. Already, committees have been set up to work out enhancement of land rates.There is also a proposal to hike power tariff for both domestic and industrial consumers. The discoms have not submitted annual revenue requirement (ARR) to the Telangana State Electricity Regulatory Commission (TSERC). The hike is expected to be a minimum of Rs 1 per unit to Rs 5 for industrial users.“The energy department is purchasing power and providing 24x7 supply to all categories of people, including agriculture. There is a huge gap between revenue requirement and earnings. The government may permit us to enhance the tariff,” a chief general manager of Telangana southern discom told TOI.",hyderabad,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73834260,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-566727,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/from-april-1-brace-for-higher-taxes-more-registration-fees/articleshow/73816870.cms

COIMBATORE: At a time when doctors hesitate to use the scalpel on patients in their 90s and even on those in their 80s, a 104-year-old farmer from Palakkad district in Kerala underwent a major intestine surgery at a Coimbatore hospital. He recovered in 48 hours and got discharged on the fifth day. Now he is back in his farm bossing around.Earlier in January, Kittuchami of Velanthavalam near Palakkad was brought to city-based Liver and Gastro Care Hospital with complaints of severe stomach pain and vomiting. “Our CT scan showed that a third of his intestine was in his scrotum, and that the intestine was obstructed due to a narrow internal hernia ring,” said Dr S Vijaykumar, who performed the surgery. “We had to do a surgery to remove the block.”Kittuchami’s children were initially hesitant and doubted whether he would be able to undergo the surgery at this age. However, since he had no comorbidities such as diabetes, hypertension or asthma and had well-functioning organs, they decided to go in for the surgery. This was the first time Kittuchami has gone under the scalpel. “But I was not scared,” he told TOI.Dr Vijaykumar said, “The 90-minute surgery involved opening up the hernia ring and removing the block. Since old people take longer to recover from anaesthesia, we used more local anaesthesia and less general anaesthesia for Kittuchami. We also used clips instead of sutures because of his wrinkled and fragile skin.”Kittuchami was on liquid diet and began walking 48 hours post-surgery, leading to his discharge on the fifth day. “Now, I can eat normally and get up and inspect my land,” he said.Kittuchami, who had been working on his land till the age of 102, is a teetotaler, non-smoker and does not chew tobacco. “Kittuchami is a clear example that good health can be achieved with a healthy lifestyle, and good health automatically brings about longevity,” Dr Vijaykumar said.

Berhampur: The famous shrine of Tara Tarini in Ganjam district is likely to get a facelift with senior officers led by 5T secretary V K Pandian on Friday visiting the 17th century temple. Apart from reviewing the ongoing projects, he interacted with the members of the temple development committee.

A development package for the famous temple is likely to be declared after the visit of chief minister Naveen Patnaik to the shrine, date of which is yet to be decided. Before filing of his nomination papers from Hinjili constituency, Naveen performed a puja at the temple.

Pandian asked the district administration to expedite all major ongoing projects of the temple before the Chaitra mela starting on March 10. The mela will be held on every Tuesday in the month of Chaitra.

A slope will be constructed near the temple to protect it at an estimated cost of Rs 23.46 crore. To be executed by the rural works department, the slope will be divided into two sections of 130 metres length and 15 metres height and 130 metres length with 18 metres height. It is expected to be completed by May.

“We have given the proposal for a permanent bus stand and beautification work of the temple,” said secretary, Tara Tarini Development Board (TTDB), Pramod Kumar Panda.

Tara Tarini, the twin goddesses are considered the presiding deity of Ganjam. Thousands of people from far off places visit the temple on every Tuesday in the month of Chaitra and on sankrantis.

After reviewing the temple works, Pandian during his day-long visit to Ganjam also visited over 25 government-run high schools in Hinjili block and Hinjili municipality under the chief minister’s constituency. He held discussions with the locals, teachers as well as students for better school infrastructure and also ate the mid-day meal with students at Makarajhol.

At several places, people and students came forward to put forth their grievances for construction of additional school building, toilet complex and demanded filling up of teacher posts.

The 5T secretary was accompanied by Ganjam collector Vijaya Amruta Kulange, project director, district rural development agency(DRDA) Sidharth Sekhar Swain and other officers.

Nagpur: Former guardian minister Chandrashekhar Bawankule has urged the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government not to reduce the allocation of the Nagpur district planning committee (DPC).

Recently, deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar had told the media that he would reduce the allocation by Rs299 crore.

Addressing a press conference on Friday, Bawankule said that the BJP-Shiv Sena government had increased the allocation from Rs502 crore in 2015-16 to Rs776 crore in 2019-20. “I urge the government to increase it to Rs850 crore instead of reducing it. I urge the three cabinet ministers of the district — Nitin Raut, Anil Deshmukh and Sunil Kedar — to use their good offices to ensure this,” he added.

The BJP leader said that the party workers would stage a demonstration at the collector’s office on Monday to press for not reducing DPC funds. “I will personally meet chief minister Uddhav Thackeray and Pawar in this regard. I have already written letters to them,” he added.

The former minister said that if the general plan size was reduced, it would impact the special component plan (SCP) as well as the tribal sub plan (TSP) thus affecting the welfare projects for SCs and STs. “Overall, all the works in the district will be affected — rural roads, water conservation, drinking water supply, special grants to gram panchayats, etc”

Pawar had claimed that Nagpur had been given additional funds by reducing the allocation of some districts in western Maharashtra and Marathwada. Bawankule strongly denied this. “It is not possible to reduce the allocation of any district. Nagpur was given special funds as it is the second capital of the state. Injustice was not done to any district,” he said.

Pawar has increased the allocation for Pune, Satara, Sangli and Bid districts. Bawankule said that he has nothing to say on this and only Nagpur’s share should be increased instead of reducing it.

HYDERABAD: Residents of the city’s IT corridoor have urged senior officials of municipal corporations and municipalities to become tech-savvy and launch an effective grievance redressal system through Twitter .

Most of the techies in the city live in and around Manikonda, Nizampet and Adibatla and they urge the civic bodies to make contact numbers and Twitter accounts of senior officials available on their websites.

“I live in Gachibowli and my previous office was in the same area. I used to often file complaints about water shortage, water-logging and commuties woes through Twitter and officials of Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation ( GHMC ) were active on Twitter and used to send workers to solve the issues immediately. But, it’s not the same anymore,” said Pratik Dalal, an employee of TCS in Adibatla.

A resident of Panchavati Colony in Manikonda said that accountability for grievances reported over phone is less. “For example, phones and websites of officials are flooded with complaints of water-logging during downpour. It becomes easy for officials to not keep their assurances made over phone. But if the complaints are raised on Twitter then there is accountability as we can tag the respective department heads and local ministers,” said Jayanth M.

Meanwhile, commissioner and director of municipal administration T K Sridevi said the department is already addressing grievances registered on Twitter as well as a mobile app and website.

He said, they have floated and opened the tenders for manpower for maintenance work activities and added that ‘managing the work to go on smoothly is only the way out to for revival of the company in present situation.

401,['1/02/2020'],Andhra Pradesh chief secretary faces CAT heat for not following order,"This story is from February 1, 2020

Nilam Sawhney

HYDERABAD: The Central Administrative Tribunal (CAT) on Friday directed AP chief secretary Nilam Sawhney to explain by February 7 as to why she failed to implement the orders of the tribunal on paying salary and arrears to IRS officer J Krishna Kishore, currently on deputation with the state.

The bench of tribunal chairman Justice L Narasimha Reddy and administration member BV Sudhakar was hearing a plea by the aggrieved IRS officer, who charged the state with harassing him with suspension and criminal cases.

He was brought in by the state four years ago on deputation to head its economic development board. But the YSRC regime stopped paying him salary ever since it came to power in May 2019. It also transferred him to the state secretariat and then suspended him.

It also ordered CID and ACB probe against him for certain alleged irregularities he committed during his stint with the economic development board. The CAT bench earlier described the situation as part of a sinister design hatched by the state authorities and stayed the December 12 suspension of Krishna Kishore, and also directed the state to clear the salary dues within two weeks.

On Friday, when the bench resumed hearing, Krishna Kishore’s counsel Neeraj Malhotra told the bench that even though it has been five weeks since the court ordered the state to pay salary and arrears, it was not implemented. The bench turned critical and said that it would summon the state’s chief secretary to know the reason for her failure in this regard.

The state brought in senior counsel D Prakash Reddy to argue its case. He sought time to know the facts of the case and argue. The bench passed over the hearing to afternoon. Prakash Reddy informed the court in the afternoon session that the authorities have cleared Krishna Kishore’s arrears. The bench did not appreciate the turn of events and sought an affidavit from the CS explaining the reasons for the failure.

403,['1/02/2020'],HC files PIL to ensure that lawyers maintain decorum,"This story is from February 1, 2020

Ahmedabad: The Gujarat high court on Friday filed a PIL suo motu on how to make the lawyers maintain court decorum and to make them courteous while addressing the court by holding continuous training programmes for people in black gown every month.

After filing a PIL itself, the bench headed by the Chief Justice Vikram Nath issued notices to the Bar Council of India, the Bar Council of Gujarat and the state government seeking their replies by February 25.

The HC filed the PIL on the basis of an order passed by Justice Bela Trivedi on December 19, 2019 for initiation of continuous education and training programmes for advocates.

Justice Trivedi imposed a fine of Rs 10,000 on an advocate Girish Das for his allegedly unwarranted arguments during a hearing. The HC insisted that the Bar Councils and the government should conduct continuous training programmes for advocates so that “the cause of administration of justice may not suffer because of incompetence of the advocates”.

In its PIL, the HC said that there cannot be a strong judicial system without an independent Bar. Lawyers are supposed to be fearless, but they should maintain dignity of judiciary at the same time, and the judges should reciprocate.

There is no room for arrogance either for a lawyer or for a judge.

However, lawyers should not waste court’s time. In case an advocate causes disrepute to judges or involves himself in misconduct, then he/she would destroy the legal system.

Hence, such persons should be removed from the profession.

“An advocate/lawyer is supposed to be governed by professional ethics, professional etiquette and professional ethos which are a habitual mode of conduct. He/she has to perform himself with elegance, dignity, and decency,” the HC’s PIL said and added, “Therefore it is necessary to direct the authorities to carry out continuous education and training programmes because the administration of justice should not suffer because of few advocates”.

HYDERABAD: In a bid to make washing hands, dental hygiene , and cleanliness interesting for kids, Butterfly EduFields has designed hands-on experiments and games.

Speaking at the Ink Wash Summit, K Sharat Chandra, CEO and founder-director of the firm, stressed on the importance of teaching children about cleanliness at an early stage.

“Children understand the issue better through games and 3D kits. Also, we are making them take a pledge to wash hands and keep their surroundings clean,” Chandra said, adding that they have distributed kits to around 10,000 schools in 18 cities.

The entrepreneurs also talked about the importance of water treatment and using the method to overcome shortage.

Gowthaman Desingh of Transwater System, who has built an IoT-based monitoring solution for water treatment projects, explained how treating water at the source can reduce the cost by at least 50%.

“When water is supplied through tankers to be used as coolants, it costs about 14 paise to 18 paise per litre. But, by operating treatment plants, we are able to supply water at 7 paise to 9 paise per litre,” Desingh said, adding that so far they have supplied 46 million litres of water.

They also used the platform to raise awareness on menstrual hygiene, manual scavenging, access to clean toilets, and rainwater harvesting among other issues.

Meanwhile, MAUD minister KT Rama Rao on Friday announced that Sanitation Hub (S-Hub) — an incubator for promoting start-ups and innovations in water, sanitation and other areas — will be established in the state. A seed fund of Rs 25 crore will be earmarked for this initiative, he added.

Addressing delegates at the valedictory session of Ink Wash Summit in the city, KTR stated that S-Hub will undertake incubation of ideas and build an ecosystem for innovations, knowledge dissemination, capacity building in Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH) sector.

KTR said that the state proposes to house the S-Hub at Administrative Staff College of India for two years and then establish a dedicated facility at the proposed Centre for Urban Excellence.

He stated that the government has prioritised the sector and is deeply committed to achieving the set targets well ahead of the globally agreed timelines.

409,['1/02/2020'],"Cotton, castor prices fall as virus clouds export prospects","This story is from February 1, 2020

Ahmedabad: Prices of cotton and castor seed have eased in local markets, as the novel coronavirus outbreak in China has clouded export prospects. While China is a major buyer, Gujarat is a leading supplier of these commodities.

Castor prices have declined to Rs 4,050 a quintal from Rs 4,180 a fortnight ago. Prices in tghe futures market are even lower, due to the uncertainty, market players say. China imports 2 lakh tonnes of castor oil worth Rs 2,500 crore every year, which is 40% of India’s castor oil exports.

“There is no impact on exports currently. However, business sentiment has been dampened due to the coronavirus outbreak. If this situation persists and derivative product makers in China are compelled to shut factories, it will certainly reduce our exports,” said B V Mehta, executive director, the Solvent Extractors’ Association of India (SEA).

According to Arun Dalal, a cotton broker from Ahmedabad, cotton prices have dipped by Rs 500 per candy (356kg) over the past week. The price of the Shankar-6 cotton variety has come down to between Rs 39,800 and Rs 39,900 from Rs 40,300-40,400 per candy.

“Cotton exports to China have also slowed mainly because of the Lunar New Year holidays and the shutting down of a dozen Chinese cities to contain the coronavirus outbreak. Payments are being delayed and letters of credit (LCs) are not being honoured as banks are closed due to the holidays,” said Nirav Patel, a city-based cotton exporter.

“Consignments are lying at ports and exporters are in a quandary as whether to ship goods to China or not. So far 5-6 lakh bales of cotton have been shipped to China from India and 3 lakh bales are presently stuck,” he added.

“60% of the total exports of cotton yarn from spinning units in Gujarat goes to China. With production affected in Chinese factories due to the virus, demand has declined significantly. As a result, the price of 30 combed hosiery cotton yarn, which is exported to China, has gone down from Rs 207/kg to Rs 200/kg,” said Dr Bharat Boghra, chairman, All Gujarat Spinners’ Association (AGSA).

“Several chemicals such as H-Acid, vinyl sulphone, J-Acid, Tobias acid, beta naphthol, naphthalene, gamma acid, K-Acid, among others are imported from China. With the outbreak, prices of these chemicals have risen significantly,” said Bhupendra Patel, chairman, Chemexil Gujarat region.“The prices are expected to remain high as the virus has crippled various provinces of China such as Hebei and Guangdong, where various factories are located,” he added.

20% raw material shortage expected

Several Indian manufacturers are heavily dependent on China for raw-material imports and the coronavirus outbreak and resultant shutdown in China is expected to affect Indian manufacturers in a big way.

Ritesh Goenka, director of an electronics OEM manufacturing company in China, said, “Due to the Chinese New Year, industrial units were to remain shut till February 2. However, based on the notification form the Chinese government, this has been extended to February 10 and it is expected the last even till February 20. As Indian industry is heavily import-dependent on China, a raw-material scarcity to the order or 20-30% of requirement is expected over the next three months.”

“The shortage of raw materials will also lead to a significant increase in prices in the Indian market which will affect demand, as local players will wait for prices to fall. Overall, this is expected to hurt sales by at least 30%,” said Goenka.

Paver block works leave a lot to be desired

Nagpur: The nexus between contractor, project management consultant and Nagpur Municipal Corporation engineer in substandard paver block work has surfaced in Phase-III cement road works in Dharampeth area.

Following directives from municipal commissioner Tukaram Mundhe, NMC’s executive engineer Amin Akhtar on Friday issued show cause notices to the construction firm JP Enterprises for installing substandard paver blocks on the patch between Ekstambh Chowk to North Ambazari road.

NMC entrusted the contractor with the work of white topping 570-metre road patch at a cost of Rs4.12 crore. The work was supposed to be completed by March 31, 2020.

A delegation of Dharampeth residents under the banner of Civic Action Guild (CAG) met the then municipal commissioner Abhijit Bangar and informed him about the substandard work in footpath construction. Following this, Bangar initiated an inquiry. The report found the contractor had failed use M-45 grade quality paver blocks. The company also fitted blocks before completion of curing period.

“As a contractor, it is your prime responsibility to execute the work as per specification of tender regarding quality of material and execution of work. However, your failure to execute the work as per specifications has led to receipt of complaint. On testing, the paver blocks have not been found as per specification, it has maligned the image of NMC,” the show cause notice stated.

It sought explanation from the firm within three days from the receipt of the notice and reason why it should not be blacklisted. Similar notices have also been issued to Project Management Consultant (PMC) M/s Creations Engineers Pvt Ltd, the firm engaged to monitor the quality of the work, and NMC’s junior engineer G Shrivastav.

PMC was appointed as NMC’s quality assurance and quality control for works under cement concrete road project Phase III. “It is the responsibility of PMC to verify the ongoing works in respect of its quality as per specification and inform NMC in case of any lacunae regarding quality of material and execution of work,” the notice stated. It too has been given three days to submit its say why it should not be blacklisted.

The executive engineer’s office also sought explanation from the junior engineer why disciplinary action should not be initiated against him for monitoring and ignoring quality of works despite being informed about substandard work.

415,['1/02/2020'],Schools vary as April 3 proposed as a ‘local holiday’,"This story is from February 1, 2020

Nagpur: Though state assembly speaker Nana Patole has proposed declaration of holiday in Nagpur division (except Gadchiroli) to mark birth anniversary of spiritual guru and social reformer Baba Jumdevji on April 3, educational institutes are hoping that the holiday tally does not go up.

Baba Jumdevji was a popular spiritual guru and social reformer from Nagpur, who passed away in 1996 but his legacy lives on through his followers. Government of India had released a postage stamp in his honour in 2013.

A senior CBSE principal , who did not wish to be identified as the issue involves a spiritual guru, said, “With due respect to Baba Jumdevji, we feel academics will suffer if holidays are increased. Yes, if it can be adjusted against some other holiday then it will be fine.”

Another state board principal said, “April is basically the last leg of the academic session for all of us and final exams are being conducted. Given the logistical constraints of spacing the papers, weekends and then freeing up teachers for board evaluation, adding a holiday will make it difficult.”

As per government rule, schools are required to be open for anywhere between 210 to 230 days depending on which level (primary, high school) the institute is.

For Patole’s proposal, state’s general administration department (GAD) has put the onus on Nagpur divisional commissionerate as the holiday demand is only for Nagpur, Chandrapur, Wardha, Gondia and Bhandara districts.

The GAD letter also mentions that the list of public holidays has already been finalized in December itself. The district administration can declare three local holidays, which take care of festivals or major events that are specific to a region. And these, like public holidays, also have been decided in December, which practically leaves no wriggle room for the local administration at least for this calendar year.

Nagpur divisional commissioner Sanjeev Kumar said, “I will meet my officials and see what can be done.”

417,['1/02/2020'],Promoting knowledge centres can help strengthen fundamentals,"This story is from February 1, 2020

Nagpur: Research institutes and academicians have called for more focus on development of scientific methods and technology in agriculture sector as well as making base of youths stronger through knowledge centres instead of innovation hubs.

Physics professor and head of knowledge centre at Priyadarshini Institute of Engineering and Technology (PIET) Sanjay Jain said every college and school must have knowledge centres. “If the government wants to build scientific temperament, liberal funding must be done. In general, this sector gets very less funds. Instead of innovation hubs, knowledge centres must be promoted so that fundamentals are strengthened. We have Raman Science Centre (RSC) but we should have PPP model so that accountability will increase. The gap between arousing interest and teaching science is big,” he said.

Principal of Abha-Gaikwad College of Engineering Prashant Kadu said this is the dream year of Dr APJ Abdul Kalam, where he had given a vision of India2020. “The vision was of making India a sustainably developed country. The FM shall provide special provisions for agriculture, it can include subsidies for use of modern technology in creating better agri infrastructure. Provide funds for promotion of farmer’s producers organizations and MSME clusters for agriculture business. We must strengthen PM-Kisan, MNREGA, etc schemes for rural development,” he said.

Officer in-charge & Principal Scientist at Ginning Training Centre SK Shukla said, “Skill development programme in different areas of cotton processing are needed. Power generation from biomass pellet is being utilized in major countries. The reason is UN has declared that whosoever is using power from biomass will get carbon credit and tagged pollution free. If world over power plants are switching to pellet, India should also give up coal. Government will have to promote use of pellet to cut emissions. Instead of burning biomass, it can generate power,” he said.

Shukla also said there is lack of storage facilities for farmers which must be set up beside agricultural mechanization. “At taluka level, government must invest in bank of machines for farmers,” he said.

MS Ladaniya, Director & Mission Leader (Technology Mission on Citrus), ICAR — Central Citrus Research Institute, said scientific temperament among youths must be propagated. “To generate more interest about science and technology among youths, government should spend more on strengthening schools and science colleges across the country through better lab equipments, facilities and faculty. This will go a long way in building a society with scientific outlook in New India. Presently, our schools and colleges lack trained staff and desired facilities,” he said.

421,['1/02/2020'],"Give states power to decide on CAA, TRS MPs tell PM","This story is from February 1, 2020

Hyderabad: States should be given the power to decide whether to implement legislation like the Citizenship (Amendment) Act ( CAA ). This was stated by TRS MPs K Keshava Rao and Nama Nagehswara Rao during an all-party meeting with Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Lok Sabha speaker Om Prakash Birla in Delhi on Thursday. The meeting was held ahead of the budget session in Parliament.

“Many state assemblies have passed resolutions against CAA. We said during the meeting that a detailed discussion should be held if the Centre legislates an Act and states pass resolutions against it,” Keshava Rao, who is a Rajya Sabha MP, told TOI. “Now a peculiar situation has arisen as thousands of people are out on the streets protesting against CAA, NPR and NRC. Federalism lies in states getting more powers.”

Telangana chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao has said his government will move a resolution against CAA in the upcoming assembly session.

If the Centre has the power to bring a bill, states have the right to express their opinion in the form of a resolution, he added. “We asked the Centre to think over the situation in the country. Apart from this, we asked for removing doubts on NPR and NRC as some Union ministers had made contradictory statements on NRC,” the TRS MP, who is also secretary general of the party, added.

Referring to GST and IGST dues, he said the present trend of increased centralisation of powers by the Union government was forcing the states to knock the doors of the Centre with a begging bowl for their legitimate funds. “Telangana was entitled for over Rs 50,000 crore dues which were not cleared,” Keshava Rao said.

TRS Lok Sabha floor leader Nama Nagehswara Rao said, “We also raised issues related to the economic slowdown and unemployment and their impact on the state. Besides, we want a discussion on issues pending over the bifurcation of Andhra Pradesh in 2014. Even after six years, many promises, like having a steel plant at Bayyaram have not been fulfilled.”

422,['1/02/2020'],Implementation of zero budget farming can ease farm distress,"This story is from February 1, 2020

Nagpur: In the Budget speech of 2019, finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman had made a push for zero budget farming, calling it a means to tackle the country’s agrarian problems. This year too, farm activists and experts are hoping for a similar approach for easing the farm distress.

Amravati’s Subhash Palekar, proponent of zero budget farming who has christened the method after his own name, says a lot of planning took place in the last one year. He hopes for some implementation to happen now. Not much could happen on the ground as it takes time for a large-scale conversion to an altogether new system, he says. Palekar hopes that some measures on zero budget may be announced on Saturday.

“The agricultural practice that I have been propagating does not need any budgetary allocation. Instead, the government needs to carry out promotional activities and all that a farmer needs to have is one cow of indigenous breed,” Palekar told TOI.

As Palekar hopes for some measures to be announced on what he calls as Subhash Palekar Natural Farming (SPNF), other farm activists have demanded a bailout package for the sector. There have been demands for loan waiver schemes too.

“The prime objective is to ensure cash flow into the rural economy leaving disposable income in the hands of farmers. The farmers’ income also needs to match the rising living standards. Even the wages under Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MNREGA) have gone up leaving more money in the hands of farm hands. The rates of agricultural produce too need to go up,” said Vijay Jawandhia, a veteran Shetkari Sanghatana activist.

Kishore Tiwari, chairman of Vasantrao Naik Shetkari Swavalamban Misison (VNSSM), said the government should declare a bailout package of Rs3 lakh crore, which can include a loan waiver plan too. VNSSM is Maharashtra government’s thinktank on farm crisis.

He also called for changes in the Prime Minister’s Crop Insurance Scheme. “The area for calculating losses should be brought down to an individual farm holding as against a block of villages or even a single village. At present, insurance companies grant compensation only if the losses are recorded in a block which includes 20 villages. This leaves many without any compensation,” said Tiwari.

Vijay Ingle, an award winning farmer from Akola district, says the government should increase subsidy for drip irrigation equipment. Referring to herbicide tolerant cotton seeds, he also demanded that government liberalize use of technology.

Meanwhile, Palekar said he had held meetings with Niti Aayog throughout the year. “The last meeting was held three months ago. I am not sure, but certainly hope that the government would come up with some more measures this time. I feel both chemical and organic farming are hazardous,” he says.

Ahmedabad: A 30-year-old jeweller from the Satellite area of city had on Monday filed a complaint stating that two men sprayed something on him after which he fell unconscious and they stole jewellery worth Rs 56 lakh from him. This has turned out to be a fabricated story, which he said he made up because he was in debt due to the slow down in the jewellery market.

A satellite police official said the jeweller, Bhaumik Shah, had alleged that two men had robbed him of ornaments worth Rs 56 lakh on Monday afternoon. Police had formed seven teams to nab the perpetrators.

When the cops asked for CCTV footage, Shah told them that his camera was not functional. Police later checked his mobile phones and found that various moneylenders had called Shah demanding money. Due to his suspicious behaviour, police questioned him about the incident and found discrepancies in his statements.

When the cops asked about his financial transactions, he broke down and told the cops that he had borrowed lot of money from various moneylenders. He told the cops that he had also thought of committing suicide, but on seeing his family dropped the idea.

To get himself out of the financial mess he found himself in due to the slowdown in the jewellery market, Shah decided to fabricate the robbery story to claim insurance of Rs 90 lakh.

Rajeshwari Rane with her husband’s medals

PUNE: Octogenarian Rajeshwari Rane has always wanted that her husband Major Rama Raghoba Rane ’s Param Vir Chakra , a valued possession, stay with the family.

She will hand over the cherished medal to Chief of Army Staff General Manoj Naravane at Bombay Engineering Group (BEG) and Centre during the bicentenary parade of the Bombay Sappers on February 1.

“The Bombay Sappers have become a part of our family over the decades. So my husband’s medal should remain with the family forever. It will inspire generations of sappers to sacrifice everything for the nation,” she told TOI at her residence in Bhosalenagar.

Major Rane was decorated with the award in 1950. He had cleared a road block and anti-tank mines in Noushera-Rajouri road in Jammu & Kashmir despite being wounded in the mortar firing from Pakistan troops on April 8, 1948.

The armoured regiment could then launch its operation in the crucial sector the next day.

He was the first army officer to receive the award when alive. Rane was also the recipient of a record Five Mention-in-Despatches in operations, recommended by senior officers.

Rajeshwari’s association with the Bombay Sappers began on February 3, 1955, when they got married in Karwar in Karnataka.

“Our school had invited ‘Saheb’ (as she called Major Rane) for a felicitation. I was one of the five girls from the school who sang the welcome song in his honour. He saw me on stage and liked me instantaneously. When my parents got his marriage proposal, my father thought he had a bad leg. Saheb, when visiting our house for the first time, jumped across the well near our home to prove that he had good legs,” she recalled.

Major Rane was strict and disciplined, immaculate in his dressing and his food habits and an avid follower of all sports.

“Even after retirement, he would always wear a tie and polish his shoes before leaving home. He would wear the same attire to visit our farms in Daund . He had maintained this throughout his life,” she said.

Major Rane had shared a close association with Lt Gen PS Bhagat, the recipient of Victoria Cross, the highest gallantry award of the British forces.

Captain Rane was to arrive at Pune railway station on July 30, 1950 after he received the PVC from President Rajendra Prasad. The then BEG and Centre Commandant Colonel Bhagat went to receive him.

A rare Films Division footage shows army officers and the people surging at the Pune railway station to receive Captain Rane. He was garlanded and escorted in a procession in an open jeep through Sassoon Road and Bund Garden bridge.

“Colonel Bhagat was a highly decorated officer. But, he honoured Saheb throughout his career. I see this unique character in all the officers of the Bombay Sappers even today,” the octogenarian said.

Just two months before he died on July 11, 1994 at the Command Hospital, Saheb made a request to his wife. “He said he wanted his last rites performed at the BEG Centre. It was done so with full military honours. I am repaying the respect to that gesture and the affection by handing over the medal to the centre,” she added.

TRICHY: The traffic wing of Trichy city police has refused to disclose information on a query sought by a petitioner under the Right to Information Act (RTI) 2005 seeking statistics of cases booked for various traffic violations and penalties collected. The petitioner said that the plea was filed to ascertain whether the city traffic police are giving equal weightage to all traffic violations and not just helmetless riding, something which has been pointed out in complaints from the public. Ironically, he received answers to a similar RTI query posed to the Chennai traffic police for the corresponding period.

K P Rangaprasad, joint secretary of Satta Panchayat Iyakkam (SPI), filed the RTI query in September last year seeking answers to 17 questions including action taken against rash driving and signal jumping which are rampant in Trichy city. Since the traffic police did not provide a reply, he filed an appeal in December. He got a reply on January 13, but the data that he sought — on traffic violations and penalisation between January 2018 and October 2019 — was missing. Instead, the traffic police refused to share the information citing section 8 (1)(h) of the RTI Act which reads “information that impedes the process of investigation or apprehension or prosecution”. “We asked only the number of cases and penalty collected for various violations and certainly not any individual case details. Trichy traffic police have unlawfully denied a reply since they fear that their inefficiency in enforcement may get exposed,” Rangaprasad told TOI.

“If section 8 (1)(h) applies to Trichy traffic police in refusing the information sought on traffic violations, it should also apply to the Chennai traffic police. However, Chennai police furnished the information we asked,” Rangaprasad added. The petitioner said his organisation will take legal recourse in this regard against the city traffic police by approaching the State Information Commission. “We denied reply for the RTI queries only after consulting with our legal experts,” an official with city traffic police wing said.

SCB workers demolish the illegal structure in Kakaguda, Lalbazar

SECUNDERABAD: Ahead of Secunderabad Cantonment Board (SCB) elections, officials are conducting drives to tackle the issue of illegal structures under their jurisdiction. As part of one such drive, the SCB demolition squad razed an illegal structure at Kakaguda in the Lalbazar area of Secunderabad Cantonment.

“On receiving a tip off, SCB engineering officials visited the property at Kakaguda and found that the property owner had built nine pillars on G+2 structure, and was dumping building material on the roof in a bid to raise a third floor. We immediately verified our records to check if any requests had been submitted by the property owner to construct these pillars. But so such request was made and no permissions were sanctioned by the engineering wing to the owner,” SCB additional engineer, B Balakrishna told TOI.

“With the permission of SVR Chandra Sekhar, SCB chief executive officer, we deployed a demolition squad and razed the entire illegal structure. We also warned the property owner that severe action would be initiated as per the Cantonment Act, if he tries to rebuild the structure later,” he said.

Authorities said that it was difficult to curb such illegal additions to existing structures as property owners build the primary structures as per rules and construct the illegal additions much later, on the sly.

“Most property owners initially build the structures as per Cantonment law with all permissions and documentation. After a few years, the same property owners construct illegal structures by raising the floors,” a senior SCB engineering wing official said.

While residents claim that official apathy is the root cause for the increasing number of encroachments, SCB authorities said that they have been making consistent efforts to address the problem. Officials said that they were conducting systematic drives in all areas to identify defaulters and were attending to any and all complaints on illegal construction.

Officials appealed to people to approach SCB with evidence of illegal structures in their locality and assured that the informant’s details and whereabouts would be kept confidential.

AHMEDABAD: Rapid urbanization has either shrunk or altogether wiped out open spaces and playgrounds. As a result, demand has grown for sports facilities in city clubs. And most clubs that are in the expansion mode are batting for developing sports facilities. City-based developer Savvy group will inaugurate Sports Sanskaar, a dedicated sports-centric club in Ahmedabad on Sunday.

“The sports club has been set up to provide an international-level sports academy in Ahmedabad,” said Jaxay Shah, the managing director of Savvy Infrastructures.

“It will offer facilities and training to sports and health enthusiasts.” The club will house a 500 metre swimming pool and practice and kids’ pool; a football field, a cricket pitch; tennis, badminton, squash, and basketball courts; and a 400 metre relay track.

Some of the older and established clubs in the city — Gujarat Sports Club , Rajpath Club, and Karnavati Club — which have already acquired land for expansion are laying special emphasis on developing more sports facilities.

“There is a space constraint on the current premises which will not be the case in the upcoming clubs and thus, more sports-centric facilities will come up,” said Naimish Marfatia , the honorary secretary of Gujarat Sports Club. “The facilities include three tennis courts, four badminton courts, and a large swimming pool.

Cumulative investments to the tune of a couple of hundred crores are estimated as these facilities get developed. “Rajpath Club plans to invest Rs 50-70 crore for the new premises which will focus on sports facilities,” said Rajpath Club secretary, Mishal Patel .

“Majority of the younger members demand and use sports amenities. A dedicated cycling track in addition to a nature park are also in the offing.”

Karnavati Club is expected house a dedicated children’s park and rifle-shooting range, in addition to other sports amenities on its upcoming premises on Sanand-Kadi Road.

Trichy Corporation Commissioner S Sivasubramanian addressing the college students on swachh survekshan

TRICHY: Despite the large-scale proxy voting pursued by Trichy corporation in submitting feedback to evaluate its performance in maintaining the city’s cleanliness, the urban local body has slipped to rank 3 among the cities in the state on the number of feedback submitted.

As part of Swachh Survekshan 2020 (SS2020), the ministry of housing and urban affairs has been receiving feedback from residents of all participating cities since January 1. As the feedback recording process concluded on Friday, statistics on the official website of SS2020 revealed that Trichy is behind Coimbatore and Madurai among the Tamil Nadu cities in this regard. The feedback will be obtained by the agency entrusted by MoHUA in multiple modes including face-to-face interviews, outbound calls, Swachhata application, SS2020 web portal and “vote for your city” application seeking responses for questions asked on grading the performance of the local body in maintaining public hygiene.

While it is mandatory for the residents to submit their own feedback, Trichy corporation in the past few weeks registered proxy feedback posing as residents. By obtaining the mobile numbers of the residents, employees and people entrusted by the corporation have been recording feedback for a set of questionnaire, all in favour of the civic body. “During the oral polio vaccination, corporation workers obtained our mobile number and asked us to submit the one time password received in a text message. It seems that the civic body submitted favourable feedback for SS2020 on behalf of us,” H Ghouse Baig, a resident of Khajamalai said. While the survey is conducted for a total of 6,000 marks, 25% of the marks are earmarked for the citizen feedback category.

HYDERABAD: A newly-married woman hung herself to death in her Vanasthalipuram residence on Friday. Police said S Pallavi took the extreme step following harassment by her businessman-husband and in-laws. A dowry death case was registered. Police, however, are yet to arrest the offenders.

Pallavi, who worked in HSBC before her marriage two months ago, was just 28. “At the time of the marriage, the woman’s family gave Rs 2 lakh cash along with jewellery and household items as dowry. Soon after the marriage, her in-laws started harassing her physically and mentally demanding additional dowry,” said Vanasthalipuram inspector A Venkataiah. Pallavi was an MBA graduate.

Soon after her in-laws went out for a hospital check-up and husband Santosh for business work, Pallavi hung herself to the ceiling fan at her Sri Srinivasapuram Colony residence. “She must have taken the extreme step between 8am and 9 am,” the inspector said.

When the in-laws — Srihari and Vijayalakshmi — came and knocked the door, she did not respond.They broke the door only to find her hanging from the ceiling fan.

Police shifted her body to a hospital for an autopsy.

Following a complaint from Pallavi’s parents, a case was filed against Santosh and the in-laws.

(From left) Lt Gen Michael Mathews, Lt Gen SN Sharma (retd) & Major David Young (retd)

PUNE: Major David Young is 98 years old, but the World War II veteran, a Military Cross awardee who lives in England , came all the way to the Bombay Engineering Group (BEG) and Centre, his alma mater in Khadki , to be a part of his unit’s bicentenary celebrations.

Young who participated in the heritage walk said his visit to the centre on Friday was after 77 years and the centre’s progress had surprised him.

Like him, many veterans of the Bombay Sappers were overwhelmed by the artefacts, wall paintings, medals, and flags inside the renovated museum. Former Engineer-in-Chief Lt Gen SM Sharma (retired), the seniormost veteran, and youngest recruit, Charanjit Singh, inaugurated the museum.

Young, who commanded 30 field company of the Royal Engineers of the British Army in the Burma sector, told TOI, “It’s a wonderful feeling to be here and to spend the morning with officers and sappers of my unit. I am proud of this historic occasion.”

He said the unit had remembered him even though he was in England and had invited him for the bicentenary celebrations. “Remembering our brave men is the core ethos of the Bombay Sappers. Hence, I am here today,” he said.

“In early 1942, we were sent to the Burma sector and were there till July 1945. Post-war, our unit carried out infrastructural works in Malaysia. I was awarded the medal for my contributions in the Southern Burma sector,” Young recalled.

After returning to England in 1946, he said, former Indian Army Chief General KV Krishna Rao, who had also fought in the Burma sector, kept him updated about the Bombay Sappers.

The museum has sections like the martyrs’ gallery, generals’ stand, sappers’ room, sports wing and others.

“We have renovated our old buildings and converted them into the museum. There 75,000 names stored in the electronic kiosk. Each sapper and officer will find his name at a click of a mouse. The remaining will also be included,” Brigadier MJ Kumar, Commandant of BEG and Centre, told TOI.

The martyrs’ gallery has records of the brave sappers along with records, pictures and information about the Bombay Sappers in pre and post-independence.

The heritage walk culminated at the memorial of second Group Subedar Major Savee Erappa Satoor. On Friday evening, Chief of Army Staff General Manoj Naravane attended an orchestra at the Centre.

MUMBAI: The matrimonial dispute between Jaidev Shroff, global CEO, UPL, and his estranged wife Poonam Shroff came up before Bombay high court on Friday with the final hearing of her plea for monthly maintenance of Rs 1.3 crore.

His counsel team of Navroz Seervai and Vineet Naik launched a response on law before a bench of Justice Ajay Gadkari. Seervai read out from Poonam’s petition to argue hers was a “luxury lifestyle,” by her own admission, on pages 170 to 184. He argued while she had emphasised on the expenses incurred during travel and shopping, she was yet to account for or establish an entitlement for her claim of Rs 1.3 crore per month.

She had based her plea on monthly expenses, including maintaining her child. Seervai said she was “ridiculously inflating the figures,” but had “not been able to establish even to an extent of zilch” to justify her claim and had challenged the order of the trial court seeking to enhance an already more than sufficient alimony pendante lite to her.

Justice Gadkari asked her counsel Rohit Kapadia to declare under which provision they would proceed. It was declared the matter proceed under Special Marriage Act. It will be heard next week.

440,['1/02/2020'],Backward class students launch protest against hostel mess contractor,"This story is from February 1, 2020

Students protest at Babasaheb Ambedkar Social Welfare Bhavan near Deekshabhoomi on Friday

Nagpur: Over 100 socially backward class students staying at the state social welfare department ’s Manish Nagar boys hostel are up in arms after being served inadequate, poor quality and contaminated food by the private mess contractor. They accused the contractor’s staff of threatening them for objecting to the food issues at the hostel, and accused officials of asking them whether they are here for “food or education”.

After the inmates declared an indefinite hunger strike outside the department’s office at Babasaheb Ambedkar Social Welfare Bhavan on South Ambazari Road on Friday, authorities set up a panel of three assistant social welfare commissioners to probe the allegations.

The assistant commissioners of Chandrapur, Gondia and Bhandara will conduct the probe and submit a report in a couple of days, said Nagpur’s assistant commissioner (hostels) Babasaheb Deshmukh. “The guilty should be identified and will be dealt with as per law,” Deshmukh said.

The premises witnessed tension when the students, mainly from SC/ST categories, refused to leave, and demanded immediate sacking of the contractor. Cops were called, after which some of the students were asked to accompany them to the assistant commissioner’s office. The students refused to meet the officer but left the premises when cops informed them about the setting up of the inquiry panel.

BA-LLB final year student Pundalik Pathale said the issues have gone unresolved for the last four months. “We were promised a new contractor would be appointed in September. We waited till January and on the 20th we met the divisional commissioner at this department. He said by January 31 all issues will be resolved. We have been missing classes but authorities are not bothered,” he said.

Pathale said the commissioner has told them to do whatever they want, and asked if “they come for education or food”.

The inmates claimed they have been facing drunk hostel mess staffers who threaten them, kharra residue in cooked rice, and non-veg stuff in vegetarian food. “The problem has increased now. We can tolerate poor quality food but not threats. When we request them not to eat kharra while serving or cooking food, they intimidate us by asking us to meet them outside. They also threaten to hold back our Rs800 monthly stipend,” said BE final year student Vikas Khetre.

The inmates, enrolled for different courses in city colleges, said they even asked for direct transfer of mess funds in their accounts but were told that they will get only 50%. “We want to eat out. The government allocates Rs4,800 per student. But they refuse to give full amount to us,” said Sagar Lanjewar.

BA student Harshal Sontakke also said the contractor’s men told them that they can eat only twice a day while they are entitled to three meals.

441,['1/02/2020'],"Ahead of budget, Telangana eyeing bigger central pie","This story is from February 1, 2020

Telangana CM K Chandrashekhar Rao

HYDERABAD: As all eyes are on Saturday’s Union budget , Telangana is looking for a bigger central pie. Telangana is among four states in the country which account for higher contribution of state revenues to the central pool but get far less fund transfers from it. Experts said the budget presentation on Saturday will also have an impact on budget estimates of Telangana for next year.

Telangana along with Haryana, Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu has over 70% share of state revenues in the central pool. States like Bihar, J&K, Himachal Pradesh and north-eastern states, however, depend heavily on central fund transfers to manage their revenues.

Haryana tops the list of the states which has 77% of receipts from the state revenues, while the rest accrues from the central share. Haryana is closely followed by Maharashtra with 74% of state receipts, while Tamil Nadu and Telangana share the third place with 70% of state revenues. “This would mean that Telangana has only 30% dependency on the central share of fund transfers. This is certainly not a good sign for a state which was born just five-and-a-half years ago,” a senior official pointed out.

Total revenue receipts of states comprise revenues from own sources and transfers from the central pool. During 2015-20, 53% of revenue receipts of states had come from own sources, while 47% accrued from central transfers.

Own revenue sources consist of tax revenue (45%) and non-tax revenue (8%). Central transfers consist of share in central taxes (28%) and grants-in-aid from Centre (19%). As per the recommendations of the 14th Finance Commission, the share of states in Union taxes was increased from 32% to 42%.

During the 13th Finance Commission period (2010-15), the share of devolution of central taxes and grants-in-aid from the Centre in the revenue receipts of states was at 22% and 17% respectively.

442,['1/02/2020'],"Health care ‘unwell’, so repeat dose of demand for more funds","This story is from February 1, 2020

Nagpur: More allocation for public health sector, better infrastructure in government hospitals, funds for more medical colleges, tax relief on life-saving medicines, affordable joint replacement surgeries, cheaper diagnostics services and so on — the list appears repetitive but the health sector of Vidarbha is still expecting the same from the government.

Those in the health care sector said the midterm Budget presented by NDA 2 was disappointing. “What can we expect from the Budget that allocates 1% of the total GDP for entire health care sector of the country having 130 crore plus population? Last year, the allocation was about Rs62,000 crore which is nearly 1.1% of the total GDP,” said Dr Deepak Vaishnav , senior executive officer of a corporate hospital in city.

“Central Government has mentioned in its National Health Policy that it will earmark 2.5% of the total GDP for health care. This figure comes to Rs1.50 lakh crore. I expect this Budget to at least come closer to this figure,” he said.

Citizens expect some cut in their monthly expenses on medicines. “More than 40% of the urban population purchases medicines for hypertension and diabetes. These medicines are to be taken for lifetime. So, they should be cheaper,” said Rekha Manwatkar, a housewife.

Private sector shoulders more than 80% burden of India’s health care. The economic slump has affected this sector badly. “The usual 13% to 15% profit margin has shrivelled to 7-8% which not even covers burden of high bank interest rate. Commercial bank interest rates, minimum salary benchmarking, and other government norms are adding to the per bed expenditure leading to significant losses for hospitals,” said Dr Anup Marar , director of a leading private hospital in city.

“Moreover, rates under government schemes are very less. Cashless services, subsidized charges are increasing fiscal crisis. I expect health care sector should come under the 5% slot of GST which may provide some relief,” he said.

Doctors working in government set-up were not willing to be named but their expectations too focused around more allocations to health sector. AIIMS Nagpur is shaping up fast but it needs more allocations from the Centre to recruit staff and teachers for super speciality section.

Other institutions are mostly linked to state government, so they expect that Budget should fill state’s kitty with more money for health sector expenses.

Doctors of AYUSH section too expect more funds. “Entire AYUSH budget for the year 2019 was Rs1,938.76 crore. During the same period, turnover of Patanjali Ltd was more than Rs8,000 crore. Many such companies are making huge money in the name of AYUSH but the sector which is backbone of this economy is in crisis,” said Dr Mohan Yende, organizer of Maharashtra State National Integrated Medical Association.

Yende also wants Ayurveda to be declared as National System of Medicine and promoted in all government and private sectors.

Health insurance is important for salaried class. “Government wants more citizens to get covered with health insurance, but charges 28% GST on its premium. This can’t be a way to encourage people to go for insurance. Cut GST rates and make health insurance affordable,” said insurance adviser Abhishek Ingle.

Mangaluru: Mangaluru Smart City Limited (MSCL) has changed its plan prepared for the construction of a multi-level car parking (MLCP) complex in the city.

The MSCL had planned to build an MLCP on 2.2 acres at Hampankatta, and a tender in this regard was already finalised. However, MSCL could not come to an agreement with landowners, who possess 60 cents in the area.

Hence, the plan has been changed and the MLCP will be built on 1.6 acres owned by the Mangaluru City Corporation (MCC), said MSCL managing director Mohammed Nazeer .

The MSCL had planned to take up the project of constructing an MLCP with commercial complex and other facilities at an estimated cost of Rs 94 crore though the Smart City mission.

“We held several meetings at the local levels and through the deputy commissioner and chairman of MSCL. However, we could not finalise the project since owners of 60 cents in the nearby areas are not agreeing to the terms and conditions we laid. Meanwhile, the conditions laid down by the landowners are not agreeable for us. Hence, we have decided to redesign the project by limiting the MLCP complex to 1.6 acres owned by the MCC,” Nazeer said.

In fact, the MSCL had in September 2019 awarded the contract to build the proposed MLCP to a company. However, now the plan will have to be changed based on the availability of land, he said, adding that the work is expected to begin in the first week of February.

Initially, the MLCP project was planned through Mangaluru Urban Development Authority (MUDA). However, in 2014, a council meeting of the MCC decided to implement the project on its own through PPP.

However, after Mangaluru city was selected under the Smart City mission of the central government, the MLCP project was included in it.

446,['1/02/2020'],Gujarat to have website for cadaver organ donation,"This story is from February 1, 2020

Representative image

AHMEDABAD: A year after setting up the State Organ and Tissue Transplant Organization (SOTTO), Gujarat will now launch a dedicated website for coordination of cadaver organ donation. Dr Jayanti Ravi, principal secretary, health, informed the same on Friday to participants of the 3rd roundtable on organ donation organized by The Times of India (TOI) and Kokilaben Dhirubhai Ambani Hospital (KDAH) in Ahmedabad. Ravi said the website will be launched in February, within a month.

“The development is in final stage. After deliberations, it was decided that it would be modelled on the NOTTO website and hosted by the National Informatics Centre (NIC) to address safety and privacy concerns,” said Dr Ravi. States like Tamil Nadu and Kerala already have such websites in place.

The roundtable was also attended by Jai Prakash Shivahare, commissioner (health); Dr Somnath Chattopadhyay and Dr Santosh Shetty from KDAH, Mumbai; Dr Rajesh Chandwani from IIM Ahmedabad; Dr Dhiren Shah, heart transplant surgeon; Dr Chirag Desai, liver transplant surgeon; Dr Kavita Parihar, nephrologist; and Bhavna Chhabria from Shatayu.

While Dr Chattopadhyay deliberated on hand-holding of smaller centres and hospitals by major hospitals to create a cohesive ecosystem, citing example of Mumbai, Dr Desai advocated a system of transplant coordinators at both transplant and non-transplant hospitals that can work closely with relatives of brain-dead patients.

Dr Parihar put forth the issue of non-representation of private hospitals in SOTTO and said that the robust model should have organ-specific committees involving all stakeholders. Dr Shah seconded her, adding that steps such as generation of common waiting list have not been implemented so far.

“The hospitals affiliated with medical colleges have been authorized for declaration of brain stem death in the state. Extensive training workshops have been organized for the doctors and staff which is yielding good results,” said Shivahare, adding that they will be working on awareness campaigns to dispel myths.

Dr Chandwani said that organ donation is a complex process and at initial stage should focus on organ retrieval. For the same, training and transparency can do the trick. Chhabria mentioned that non-transplant hospitals in Gujarat have no transplant coordinators or ‘grief counsellors’ who could work with doctors and relatives and also stressed on early-stage education initiatives.

The participants said that Gujarat has a chance to learn from good practices from India and abroad with government and health sector-led initiatives including better identification of brain-dead patients, coordination between various agencies, transparent organ retrieval and distribution system and better awareness among citizens.

HYDERABAD: ACB sleuths arrested a GHMC tax inspector on Friday for demanding Rs 75,000 bribe to transfer the title of house ownership of a retired Army Major General . ACB officials said the accused official, P Jagan , insisted on the bribe.

The sleuths trapped Jagan red-handed on Khairatabad main road at 2.45 pm when he accepted the tainted money from Degala Raju, who represented the former Army officer Satish Chandra Nair. Jagan is a tax inspector in circle 18, zone-5, Khairatabad, GHMC.

“The retired officer wanted to transfer the title of ownership of Jubilee Hills house on Road No. 10 from his deceased wife to his son and sent an application with necessary documents through Raju to GHMC office,” said an ACB official.

ACB officials said Jagan demanded bribe from Raju to hand over the mutation proceedings and to continue old tax pertaining to the house in the name of Nair’s wife. After completing the mutation work, Jagan demanded Raju to pay Rs 1 lakh to receive the proceedings and to not increase the house tax.

It was then Raju approached ACB following Nair’s instructions. “Jagan agreed to hand over the documents for Rs 75,000. We caught him while accepting the bribe,” said an ACB official.

He was arrested. He will be produced before the ACB special court on Saturday for judicial remand.

448,['1/02/2020'],Economic slowdown shadow on Telangana budget,"This story is from February 1, 2020

K Chandrashekhar Rao

HYDERABAD: The economic slowdown has had an impact on Telangana budget with the allocation pegged at Rs 1.48 lakh crore in 2019-20 though the estimates had put the figure in excess of Rs 2 lakh crore mark.

Looking at the revenue receipts by the end of December in 2019, Telangana has performed well on a few parameters, experts aver. They, however, point to the state receiving far less from the central pool.

The finance department is estimating that revenues for the state would improve in the last quarter of the financial year and budget estimates could look up. However, the state’s own tax revenue growth is not much to talk about.

Sources said the state government is looking at the reasons for shortfall in growth and the budget estimates would be prepared based on this. Thankfully, the grant-in-aid receipts could reach the budget estimates by December-end.

Revenue from excise and stamps and registrations is another worry. In what could cheer up the state, the Centre gave Rs 1,400 crore recently towards GST compensation to Telangana. However, the revenue growth stands at 3.5% as against 16% Telangana had recorded at one time.

Senior finance officials said the budget estimates for the state would depend on what the Centre would grant for projects like Mission Bhagiratha and Mission Kakatiya.

Hyderabad: BJP has decided to keep the heat on recent Tukkuguda municipality chairperson election by calling the bluff of TRS. A BJP delegation will submit a memorandum to President Ram Nath Kovind and Vice-President M Venkaiah Naidu. BJP also urged governor Tamilisai Soundararajan to seek an explanation from TRS government on malpractices and irregularities committed during the election of municipal chairpersons and mayors for corporations. It demanded a high-level inquiry into misuse of power and violation of constitutional norms by TRS.

A delegation led by state BJP president K Laxman met the governor on Thursday and submitted a memorandum highlighting irregularities and misuse of official machinery by TRS during and after the polls.

Laxman said TRS went all-out to take control of municipalities and corporations by violating constitutional norms. “It used ex-officio members to win chairman and vice-chairman posts neglecting mandate of people who voted for BJP,” he said.

BJP won nine out of 15 wards in Tukkududa and TRS bagged only five wards. “Yet, it managed to get posts of chairman and vice-chairman using illegal means,” he said. He said TRS MP K Keshava Rao should be suspended from Rajya Sabha membership for violation of constitutional norms.

In the memorandum, BJP said ex-officio member Sabita Indra Reddy was shifted to Tukkuguda in violation of the Municipalities Act though she had chosen Badangpet.

451,['1/02/2020'],Need more funds for better quality &amp; infra in edu sector,"This story is from February 1, 2020

Nagpur: Academicians are hoping that Budget 2020 will bring in more money for education sector to help improve not only the quality but also infrastructure.

MLC from teachers constituency Nago Ganar has been a strong proponent of increasing budgetary allocation for education. “We need to spend at least 6 to 8% of GDP on education without which quality of existing set-up cannot be sustained, forget about upgrading it,” said Ganar.

Madhusudhan Mude, president of Headmasters Association, said, “What we need to focus on is school education because that is the foundation of creating quality human resource. Funding is needed for introducing technology in all schools.”

Rajendra Dayma, president of Independent English Schools Association, said, “Central government should ensure that ample funding is available for all schemes floated by it. Money for schemes like RTE etc must be given to beneficiaries on time as well at the level it is supposed to.”

Mohd Shahid Sharif, an education activist, said integrated funding for education is needed. “Right from early childhood to higher education, we must have a comprehensive plan. Else what happens is that you have lot of funding going to higher education while schools starve for funds,” said Sharif.

Zafar Khan, founder-president of School Headmasters Charitable Association, said, “At any cost, you cannot ignore upgradation of school education because we need funding for training teachers, upgrading their skills and introducing technology in schools to bridge the urban-rural gap.”

Higher education too is in dire need of attention from the government, say academicians.

Baban Taywade, senior academician and former Nagpur University (NU) senate member, said, “Universities are dependent on quality faculty and infrastructure. And these can happen only if government ensures a steady stream of funding. We need to open more government education institutes as private ones are extremely costly,” said Taywade.

Former NU registrar and noted academician Mahesh Yenkie says faculty is the key. “Lack of faculty is evident in many universities and that’s where the problem starts. We need quality faculty at the helm for which the government needs to provide funding. If you have top class faculty then quality research and development (R&D) will follow,” said Yenkie.

Sanjay Charalwar, former principal of Mohota Science College and NU senate member, said, “There is an urgent requirement for funding of infrastructure. When you build word class institutes and facilities, an environment of excellence is created. Also, salaries of all teachers should be at par and they must be well paid. Funding for regular training is also needed.”

452,['1/02/2020'],Kolkata netizens wary of posts ‘celebrating’ Jamia firing,"Representative image

KOLKATA: The minor, who shot at the anti-CAA protesters at Jamia Nagar in Delhi, had reportedly uploaded numerous posts berating the movement and openly threatened the participants. The brazen act has been criticized across the country but what has alarmed Kolkatans is that a handful in the city seem to be “justifying and celebrating” the act.Concerned netizens in Kolkata have, thus, now started reporting all such social media profiles to the Kolkata Police cyber cell. On Friday, at least two citizens — Aiyub Khan and Pablo — tagged the messages that have been “celebrating” the violent act that left a Jamia Millia University student injured.Pablo, an engineering student residing at Sealdah, for example, has decided to approach police after another Facebook user put up a status hailing the minor as a ‘hero’. “I am hoping you would take action,” he said. The cops have acknowledged the awareness among netizens but have not detailed on whether they will probe specific cases.“We will not like to comment on individual posts. We need to look into the legal implications where end ramifications matter a lot. However, we are keeping a watch on online trends through the social media cell,” said an investigating officer.Talking to TOI, an IPS officer stated that they have a standard operating procedure (SOP) of dealing with such cases. According to him, each case is taken up for legal vetting and sometimes, counselling is offered to the accused. This necessarily involves explaining the private and public domain and a distinction between beliefs and clear threats.“Once we get the initial complaint through email, we forward it to Facebook, WhatsApp, Twitter or Instagram authorities, marking out the exact complaint. It usually takes some time for them to respond. Then we launch an initial inquiry. Not all cases can be clubbed under the Information Technology Act. Based on the written and the signed statement — it is compulsory under CrPC — we slap sections of IT Act or IPC sections. But for all such cases, the initial inquiry is most vital to fix responsibilities and gauge the seriousness of the complaint,” said an investigating officer.Bivas Chatterjee, an expert in cyber laws, who is also a special public prosecutor, said the posts show lack of maturity.“Often, fake profiles are used to put out such posts. In a diverse country like India, sensitivity is important. That comes through maturity in internet use. That is missing here. But then, merely putting out views cannot be a crime. The conduct, motive and end purpose are all important in deciding the criminality involved in a post,” he said.",kolkata,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73830193,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-225037,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/netizens-wary-of-posts-celebrating-jamia-firing/articleshow/73816961.cms
453,['1/02/2020'],"Will take 2 days to fully restore water supply, says KWA","This story is from February 1, 2020

Kochi: People affected by the ruptured pipelines near Vyttila Junction will have to wait longer for undisrupted water supply. Even with the Kerala Water Authority focused on repairing the three damaged lines, officials said it would be a couple of days before supply is fully restored. The affected portions are on the eastern and southern sides of NH-66 near the junction.

KWA assistant executive engineer Prakash Chandran is confident of completing the work by Friday midnight. “One of the damaged pipelines has already been repaired. Work of the remaining two lines can be completed by midnight. However, it will take a couple of days to completely address complaints relating to shortage in supply of drinking water,” he said.

The authority maintained that it would be able to meet the demand with water from the Aluva treatment plant. While some residents have complained of taps going dry, others have raised the issue of mucky water.

Water supply to Vyttila, Kadavanthra, Elamkulam, Chilavannoor, Poonithura, Gandhi Square, Petta, Champakkara has been completely disrupted since Wednesday.

Meanwhile, traffic cops are having a tough time re-routing traffic, especially heavy vehicles. As the service road on the eastern side of NH-66 has been dug up to repair the pipeline , heavy vehicles are banned from using the Ponnurunni NH underpass to proceed towards Kaniyampuzha Road, Vyttila Mobility Hub or Vyttila Junction. The entry point of Vylopilly Road near Vyttila Junction has also been dug up.

“Construction of the Vyttila flyover has created enough and more traffic management issues. Now, with pipeline repair work being carried out on both the eastern and western sides of NH-66, only small and medium vehicles can pass through Ponnurunni underpass. Buses and trucks coming from the south will have to move through the national highway and take the nearest U-turn head for the Kaniyampuzha Road, mobility hub or Tripunithura regions,” said a traffic cop at Vyttila Junction.

Kochi corporation councillor PS Shine said that once work on the pipelines is completed, the roads will have to be relaid to facilitate smooth movement of vehicles. “While undertaking such works there should be proper co-ordination among the various government departments,” he said, adding that have been several complaints of leaking pipelines at Vyttila Junction ever since the construction of the flyover began. “All these indicate lack of proper co-ordination,” said Shine.

454,['1/02/2020'],City expects Vid statehood or special projects,"This story is from February 1, 2020

Nagpur: With the BJP losing power in the state, many people, including public representatives, are expecting announcement of Vidarbha statehood with city as capital, or special projects for the city from the Union Budget. Chances of budgetary provisions for execution of pending projects, including Metro Rail phase-II, Nag-Pili Rivers Pollution Abatement Project etc, and continuation of existing projects including Swachh Bharat Mission, AMRUT are high.

Congress city president and West Nagpur MLA Vikas Thakre said it’s high time the BJP announces separate statehood to Vidarbha or special status for the city. “BJP at the centre and state have done nothing much for the city and other parts of Vidarbha in last six years. Existing MIDC clusters are on the verge of closure. Mihan is pending since a long time. Many industries are plunging into list of sick industries. Vidarbha statehood or any special status for the city can help regain lost glory of the city,” he said.

Mayor Sandip Joshi said the Modi government has sanctioned a slew of mega projects in last five years and city will get more in the Budget and coming years. “Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) hopes continuation of funds for ongoing projects like water supply scheme for unauthorized layouts under AMRUT, Smart City Mission, Swachh Bharat Mission etc. City had got series of premier institutes under Modi government and more are expected,” he said.

Activist Prashant Pawar too expects announcement of statehood for Vidarbha. “Upgradation of hospitals, including GMCH, are much needed. Special packages should be announced to boost orange cultivation. Metro Rail phase-II should not be cleared before completion and successful operation of phase-I. The funds meant for phase-II should be given for other urban mobility projects,” he said.

Architect Virendra Khare expressed a need to bring realty sector back on track. “System of input tax credit to builders should be revised on the lines of VAT system. Many people are not getting benefits of PMAY. Flat buyers should get subsidy of Rs2.5 lakh directly and not through banks. Many of the buyers are not able to get subsidy as banks disqualify them,” he said.

RTI activist TH Naidu said funds should be approved for proposed Sports Authority of India (SAI) Centre for its completion within a year. “A special project to develop all playgrounds like Patwardhan ground, Reshimbagh ground, Chitnis park etc should be announced. A policy should be framed for special say of people in urban local bodies. New revenue sources should be provided to cash-strapped NMC. A policy to levy hefty penalties on unauthorized constructions and encroachments should be announced to ensure balanced development of the city,” he said.

Hotel owner Aman Samundre said projects and schemes to generate employment in the city should be launched. “There are no more jobs left in the city. Self-employment is not feasible. Many young people are leaving for other cities to get jobs. Some special initiatives should be taken for upliftment of youth,” he said.

Students participate in a dharna highlighting anti-CAA, NRC, NPR sentiments at Samvidhan Square on Friday

Nagpur: A group of students belonging to different colleges on Friday evening presented street play ‘Omit Shah ka Bharat’ during the protest against CAA/NRC and police atrocities on students at Samvidhan Square . They were initially denied permission, allegedly over its title, which was perceived to be derogatory towards Union home minister Amit Shah.

Two earlier titles suggested for the play were rejected by the police as too controversial.

Beside the title, the cops were reluctant to allow the 10-minute drama as the organizers had not informed them about it while seeking permission for the protest, organized under the banner of Youth Federation for Humanity.

The protest ‘Youth Against Fascism’ was held against government inaction in cases of attacks on students, the most recent one being the shoot out at Jamia, and police excesses.

The play was written and directed by BA student Simeen Kausar. Six other girl students; Zaamin, Mantasaha, Farhat, Shahina, Nabeela and Alfaria, played the characters representing student voices against the issues. It was produced by the Aksa Group, formed in the backdrop of the ongoing protests.

Aksa Group’s Junaid Sidiqque said the play highlights the penetration of communal disturbance in schools and colleges. “Everyone is bringing his or her religious beliefs to educational institutions. Now, kids too are getting communal. The play ‘Omit Shah’s Bharat’ showcases our society will be divided,” he said.

The solution is to have cultural exchanges, he said. “We will have to hold a dialogue with each other.”

A candle light march to condemn the Jamia shooting was held after the play. Some students from Jamia too had joined the protests.

Junaid said at the end they pledged to hold workshops on educating masses on digital activism and how to bury differences. “We are launching project ‘Torch’ to educate people on CAA and NRC. Other aim is to make people understand how to identify fake videos or communally sensitive content. Digital nuisance is one of the reasons for the communal tension. We will reach out to students of city and go to their localities and homes with the messages,” he said.

Dilip Ghosh

KOLKATA: The 23-year-old Sanskrit University student (her name is being withheld due to the molestation complaint), who had protested at a BJP pro-CAA rally in Patuli on Thursday, walked into the Patuli police station on Friday morning to file a complaint against MP and BJP state president Dilip Ghosh and other BJP workers for wrongful restraint, criminal intimidation and insulting her modesty by using foul words. The student said she will not be cowed by the threats and will keep participating in anti-CAA, NRC and NPR protests.

Patuli police has registered an FIR against Ghosh and others under several penal sections. No immediate reaction was available from Ghosh, who had left for Delhi to attend the Parliament session. On Thursday itself, the student had indicated to TOI that she would file a complaint against Ghosh. “I went to the police station and lodged the complaint. Police accepted my complaint and I have been told that an FIR has been lodged,” she said on Friday. The student has received support from several locals and together they will stage a protest at the same spot at Patuli on February 3.

On Thursday, Ghosh had said, “Onar choddo purush er bhaggo bhalo je khali poster chhera hoyechhe, onno kichhu kora hoyni (It is her forefathers’ luck that only the poster was torn off and nothing else was done). There are many Baghs and Circuses to protest, why do they come to our meetings? To get publicity, or to get martyred? I say this again, this is no child’s play…we have tolerated enough, will not tolerate any more.”

On Friday, several locals, led by Trinamool Congress minister Aroop Biswas, protested against the incident. The protesters walked from Patuli to Baghajatin, holding each other’s hand as a symbol of solidarity. Biswas said, “We won’t let them divide Bengal. They should apologise for their deeds.”

“Dilip Ghosh should learn to be polite and be a gentleman. We do not speak to anyone in this manner. I believe they are scared. Are they even competent to run the country?” wondered Dipak Kumar Basu, a Jadavpur resident, who participated in the rally.

“We are really scared of going out of the house as the comments that are being passed are really dangerous. He has forgotten his age. The student against whom he spoke would be his daughter’s age,” said Indrani Banik Chowdhury, one of the protesters who took part in Friday’s rally. “We will continue with our protest because they have started treating us like animals,” said Sonali Guha of Bijoygarh.

457,['1/02/2020'],Goa given 100 days to take over coal block,"This story is from February 1, 2020

Representative image

PANAJI: The Union coal ministry has issued a stern warning to the Goa government saying that Goa could lose a coal block for the second time if it does not complete the formalities to take over the Dongri Tal II coal block at Singrauli in Madhya Pradesh.

Industries minister Vishwajit Rane, who met with the Union ministry officials, has sought a grace period of 100 days to arrange the funds required to pay the performance guarantee for the coal block that Goa Industrial Development Corporation (GIDC) plans to operate.

“The coal ministry has warned Goa to take possession of the coal block within 100 days,” Rane said.

Rane had earlier announced that the state would sign the agreement for this block by October 30.

The corporation has already identified a committee to spearhead the process to formally utilise the coal block, which was allocated to the state through a bidding process.

TOI had reported on October 4, 2019, that the corporation intended to rope in validated consultants to help the state with the coal block utilisation and with the auction of the industrial land returned by the special economic zone promoters.

The Dongri Tal II coal block at Singrauli was allotted to Goa as part of the fifth tranche of allotment by the coal ministry.

However, the cash-strapped corporation needs to pay Rs 196 crore to exploit the coal block, sources said.

Coal mines have been allotted to state governments for sale of coal under the Coal Mines (Special Provisions) Act, 2015.

The Centre said it will accept upfront payments in three instalments from successful bidders, along with the performance guarantee — equivalent to a year’s royalty — prior to the formal signing of the Coal Mine Development and Production Agreement (CMDPA).

The corporation had also applied to Coal India for yet another coal block as part of the sixth tranche of coal mines allocation.

Smooth-coated otter in Nalgonda

HYDERABAD: After north Telangana and Kapra lake in the city, smooth-coated otters have now been spotted near Gundlapally of Nalgonda district. The mammal is listed as an endangered animal by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN).

The state forest department’s wildlife wing has decided to conserve the water body where the otters were spotted as sightings have reduced recently indicating threats to the fish-eating mammal.

Zoologist and professor of Osmania University, C Srinivasulu told TOI, “In Telangana, Smooth-Coated Otters were reported as a common species found in the Godavari and Krishna river basin two decades ago. From 1995 to 2000, our team has conducted an extensive survey and recorded the population of otters in eight to 10 locations. But since then, the sightings have gone down.”

For this Prof Srinivasulu mentioned two reasons. “Unchecked fishing activity in the waterbodies harm otter habitats. They often get entangled in the nets and the fishermen hunt them as well. Due to this, otter population is restricted to major river systems in protected areas where fishing activity is regulated,” he said.

Three years ago, Smooth-Coated Otters were spotted in Kapra apart from Udayasamudram in Nalgonda.

“We thought it will make the lake its habitat,” Prof Srinivasulu said, adding, “The sighting is reported due to increased awareness and maybe the otters are also exploring new territories.”

460,['1/02/2020'],Tipeshwar control moves from Pench to Melghat,"This story is from February 1, 2020

Nagpur: In a first, Tipeshwar (149sqkm) and Painganga (425sqkm) wildlife sanctuaries in Yavatmal district have been put under the administrative control of Melghat Tiger Reserve (MTR), Amravati.

MS Reddy, additional principal chief conservator of forests (APCCF) & field director of MTR, has been asked to take over the control of two sanctuaries with immediate effect. A GR to this effect was issued on Friday.

Reddy, who already controls over 3,058sqkm area, which includes 8 wildlife sanctuaries and 1 national park in 3 districts, will get an additional control of 574sqkm now. The total area under his administration will be 3,633sqkm. However, Isapur wildlife sanctuary (121sqkm), which is under Pusad territorial division, has been left out.

The logic behind handing over both the sanctuaries to Melghat is that these protected areas (PAs) fall under Amravati revenue division. Till now the PAs were under the Nagpur revenue division. The divisional forest officer (DFO), wildlife, Pandharkawda, used to look after Tipeshwar and Painganga. Now he will report to the Melghat field director.

The area under Melghat now will be nearly close to what APCCF (wildlife), East Nagpur, HS Hooda, looks after. It will be like virtually having two parallel APCCFs for wildlife in Nagpur and Amravati revenue divisions.

Hooda, who has Tadoba-Andhari, Navegaon-Nagzira, Bor, and Pench tiger reserves and Umred-Karhandla sanctuary under his control, will no more be in-charge of Melghat and other sanctuaries which he used to administer till now.

As per the new GR, Reddy will straightway report to PCCF (wildlife) Nitin H Kakodkar, who will be his controlling officer.

Talking to TOI, Kakodkar said, “The new decision is part of the pending proposal sent to the government last year. Both, Tipeshwar and Painganga sanctuaries have been put under Amravati revenue division, which were till now under Nagpur revenue division. We will also hand over control of Isapur sanctuary to Melghat soon.”

“The fresh move will help expediting relocation of villages in which the revenue department has an important role to play. Both the divisional commissioner and the field director, who will be based in Amravati can coordinate better,” said Kakodkar.

Till now Tipeshwar and Painganga, which is 180km and 300km respectively from Nagpur, were under the control of the field director, Pench Tiger Reserve (PTR), Maharashtra. Earlier, there was also a proposal to attach these sanctuaries to the Bor tiger reserve by putting them under new field director but that plan did not auger well with the senior officials.

The state move comes at a time when forest minister Sanjay Rathod, who is three-time MLA from Digras in Yavatmal, wants to expedite the proposal to notify the Tipeshwar sanctuary as a tiger reserve by extending it.

Melghat field director Reddy said, “Getting the tiger reserve status to Tipeshwar will be his priority. We will also implement Dr Shyamaprasad Mukherjee Jan Van scheme in villages around Tipeshwar. I will be taking charge of these sanctuaries on Saturday.”

On the tiger reserve proposal, Reddy said, “When Navegaon-Nagzira and other sanctuaries attached to it can become a tiger reserve, why not Tipeshwar-Painganga?”

461,['1/02/2020'],Kolkata: Lake security stepped up after back-to-back crimes,"Winners cops patrol the area

Times View This zone (along with the Maidan) is one of the city’s two most-visited open spaces. This also makes it vulnerable to crime as there are multiple points of entry and exit. Cops have, by and large, been successful in securing Rabindra Sarobar but a couple of problem spots remain. More focused policing on these areas may help.

KOLKATA: In one of the back-to-back crimes reported at Rabindra Sarobar since Wednesday, a sub-inspector was assaulted at Rabindra Sarobar so badly that his hand fractured. Realizing how the south Kolkata green zone, especially popular among morning and evening-walkers, was under threat, the South-East division top brass pressed the emergency button and launched a special anti-harassment and anti-crime at the Lake on Friday evening.In the raid, carried out with the help of Lalbazar cops between 6.30pm and 7.30pm, cops from the all-woman Winners team and the south-east division patrolled the area and hauled up troublemakers. While some were cautioned, a few were detained. Police pointed out that crimes had increased ever since a wall was being built at the Lake, bordering the Tollygunge station. Trouble-makers and residents of local slums would jump over the raised boundary from the station and take a short-cut through the Lake premises, an officer said.Around 6pm on Wednesday, when the city was celebrating Sarawati Puja, six people allegedly molested two women and assaulted their male friend, Abdul Mustaq, a student of Herambachandra College, who went to the Lake for a stroll. Barely three hours later, trouble again broke out with eight youths refusing to leave the Lake premises even after it shut. When sub-inspector Sanjay Pandey intervened, one from the group, Tanmoy Dey, reportedly attacked him, fractured his hand and tore up his uniform. On Friday, a resident, Subhra Mukherjee, posted on the Kolkata Police Facebook page that she and her husband were stalked by half-a-dozen minor boys, commenting on their skin colour and race.In less than 24 hours since Wednesday’s incidents, cops from the Rabindra Sarobar police station made two arrests: Sk Firoz for the molestation of the women and Dey for the cop assault. Two others, Akash Das (19) and Subrata Das (18), both residents of Shahid Smriti Colony in Panchasayar, were arrested on Friday for the first case. “We have stepped up patrolling inside and outside the Lake,” said DC (south-east) Debasmita Das. Around 15 to 25 cops from the Rabindra Sarobar police station will be on duty at Rabindra Sarobar at different points of the day. The Tollygunge police station will patrol the road outside the Tollygunge station, reportedly a “trouble zone”. The current shifts of Lake patrolling, 6am to 10am and 4pm to 10pm, now see 15 men on duty. More cops would be deployed, hinted top Lalbazar officers.When TOI visited the Lake on Friday evening, only one cop was found inside the Lake, while most of the personnel were huddled at the gate near Menoka Cinema. “A wall is coming up at the Lake, bordering the Tollygunge station. Nearby slum residents jump over the wall from the station and take a short-cut through the Lake. People from Gholam Mohammad Shah Road and Lake Gardens are also using the illegal access,” an officer said.Cops said they would slap charges against peeping Toms, booking them under the ‘look case’ (Calcutta Police Act Section 68). If found taking photos or videos of anyone, more stringent action might be taken, an officer said.",kolkata,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73825083,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-625424,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/lake-security-stepped-up-after-back-to-back-crimes/articleshow/73817057.cms
462,['1/02/2020'],MIAL may get Cidco notice for Navi Mumbai airport delay,"This story is from February 1, 2020

MIAL wants encumbrance-free land to start Navi Mumbai airport work

NAVI MUMBAI: Worried over non-commencement of construction work for Navi Mumbai airport runway and terminal building, Cidco managing director Lokesh Chandra has reportedly asked his officials to examine if a notice can be served to Mumbai International Airport ( MIAL ).

Cidco holds 26% equity in Navi Mumbai International Airport (NMIAPL) as the nodal airport development authority, and MIAL 74%.

At the core is the issue of an encumbrance-free airport land. Cidco has claimed there are less than 200 structures, including 70-odd government buildings on airport land that have been handed over to the concessionaire. On the ground, though, officials said there are close to 300 structures, apart from high tension lines and mobile antennae.

MIAL wants encumbrance- free land to start work.

Cidco officials admit the concessionaire may be facing problems even from its bank, as it might not be ready to disburse funds without encumbrance-free land.

“Cidco has handed over approximately 1,156 hectares of land to the concessionaire and there are about 94 structures eligible for compensation. Besides these, there are about 70 government buildings and community temples. There may be some illegal cellphone structures too,” said a Cidco official. A drone survey was carried out jointly by officials of Cidco and the concessionaire. The survey is said to have confirmed the concessionaire’s claims of close to 300 structures.

“Though Cidco has made sizeable progress in getting the land freed of project-affected persons (PAPs) and structures, unless the concessionaire gets land free of encumbrance, how are they supposed to start work? How can the concessionaire ask its contractor to commence construction work? Apart from structures and PAPs, there are high tension lines that are yet to be shifted. Besides, there are mobile antennae. A majority of pre-development works like levelling of land and diversion of rivers are complete,” said an official.

“Though there are differences over the number of structures, some are illegal and many are unoccupied. We will sit with MIAL officials and work out a solution,” said a Cidco official.

Cidco MD Lokesh Chandra did not respond to calls or texts from TOI. GVK officials refused to comment.

Meanwhile, sources said, Chandra held a meeting with Cidco and police officials to ensure villagers near the airport site do not create a hindrance to removal of high tension lines.

CM Pramod Sawant

PANAJI: Industry bodies on Friday appealed to the state government to investigate Goa Industries Development Corporation ’s decision to pay Rs 28 lakh to the five special economic zone ( SEZ ) promoters.

Verna Industries Association (VIA) held an emergency meeting of its executive committee on Friday where the issue was discussed and where industry representatives said that they would explore legal options if GIDC went ahead with the payment of the amount. “This issue is very serious in nature which needs utmost attention of chief minister Pramod Sawant to investigate the incidents at GIDC and to do the justice to the industry and the state,” said VIA president Blaise Costabir.

Goa State Industries Association (GSIA) also met to discuss the issue, and members felt that the state government should issue directions to GIDC regarding the payment of the funds to the SEZ promoters.“GIDC should seek directions from the state government for payment to the SEZ promoters and the decision should not be brought before the board members. The managing director is acting without directions from the government,” said GSIA president Damodar Kochkar.

Industry stakeholders are concerned as they fear that GIDC will try and recover the funds by imposing higher taxes on local units.

464,['1/02/2020'],"Dense fog at Kolkata airport leads to flight cancellations, delays","This story is from February 1, 2020

The airport covered by fog on Thursday night

KOLKATA: Flight operation at the airport came to a grinding halt late on Thursday and early Friday due to dense fog. While visibility started to plunge rapidly from 11pm, it hit a low of 25m at 2am before improving gradually. Flight operations at Kolkata airport are suspended when visibility drops below 50m.

The fog led to cancellation of two international flights and delay of nine others, including three domestic flights. Most international flights in Kolkata operate at night.

Fog is a visible aerosol consisting of tiny water droplets or ice crystals suspended in the air near the earth’s surface. It is a low-lying cloud and is heavily influenced by nearby bodies of water, topography and wind conditions.

The chief of meteorology at Kolkata airport, GC Debnath, said the heavy fog formation on Thursday-Friday was an unusual phenomenon and took everyone off guard. “Usually, fog is related to low temperature and occurs early in the morning. But the thundershowers on Thursday afternoon set into motion changes in the weather condition that finally precipitated into fog. Once the sky cleared after the rain, the temperature fell rapidly. This led to moisture in the vegetations in the airport condense to form fog. It is only after after 3am, when north-northwardly breeze set in, that the fog cover lifted and formed cloud,” he explained.

AirAsia’s 1am flight to Kuala Lumpur with 142 passengers and Thai Airway’s 2am flight to Bangkok with 160 passengers were cancelled. Among the delayed flights was Malindo Air and Air Asia’s flights to Kuala Lumpur; China Eastern Airline’s flight to Kunming; Thai Airways, Thai Air Asia and SpiceJet’s flights to Bangkok. In the domestic sector, early morning flights to Delhi, Bangalore and Hyderabad were delayed.

On Friday, two domestic flights to Mumbai and Delhi run by IndiGo and two international flights run by Bhutan Airlines flight to Paro and Bangkok were cancelled because of operational reasons.

Agra: Aligarh district administration has declared two former AMU students as “Goondas” and expelled them from the district for six months for their alleged involvement in crimes in the district. Besides, three other ex-students of the varsity have also been issued notices.

The two, who had been expelled from Aligarh, were identified as Nadeem Ansari, former AMU students’ union vice-president, and Amir Mintoe alias Mohammad Aamir, who is also an ex-student of the university. Those who were issued notices for invoking the Goondas Act include Huzaifa Amir, former secretary of the students’ union, Hamza Sufiyan, former vice-president of students’ union, and Vakar Naga, an ex-student.

Barring Nadeem Ansari, all other were named in the FIRs registered against protesters, including AMU students, for their alleged involvement in the violence that erupted on the university campus on December 15. Vakar Naga, who was named in two FIRs in the December 15 violence, was remanded to judicial custody for 14 days on January 28.

A case under the Uttar Pradesh Control of Goondas Act, 1970, was being heard in the additional district magistrate (city) court, which ordered their expulsion on Thursday.

Confirming this, Aligarh DM CB Singh said that the two have been expelled from Aligarh for a period of six months, as they have “become a threat to the general public due to their criminal activities”.

According to an administrative official, Nadeem Ansari was booked four times under various sections of IPC in 2017, 2018, and 2019. This brought him under the category of a habitual criminal. Similarly, Mohammad Aamir was booked for three consecutive years under various sections of IPC, including attempt to murder, in 2015, 2016 and 2017.

Singh said that the district administration is committed to ensuring continuous strict action against people with a criminal history. Therefore, similar action will be taken in the future against the mafia and criminals under the Goondas Act, besides considering their expulsion from the district.

Nadeem Ansari told reporters that such steps are being taken by the authorities to weaken the movement against CAA/NRC. “In order to end the protest in the district, they are invoking the Goondas Act against people actively involved in such protests,” he said. Mintoe said that he has not received any notice so far, but if it is true, then he would like to thank the government for putting him in the category of revolutionary leaders, who were expelled from the district during the British period.

Chandrapur: Terming the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) as a black law, thousands of women staged daylong sit-in near Ballarpur Municipal Council office on Friday. The protesters also condemned the Centre’s proposed move to go for National Register of Citizens (NRC) despite strong opposition to it throughout the country.

The sit-in was staged under the banner of Women Against NRC, Muslim Ekta Manch and other organizations.

Addressing the all-women protest, Aam Aadmi Party leader Paromita Goswami said the CAA and NRC are not just about Muslims, but also against the OBCs and Scheduled Tribes. “Women will be worst sufferers of this black law as they will have to face Herculean task of proving their citizenship based on their name, which changes after marriage. Many people don’t have any proof of their birth date or birth place etc. Such people will face the daunting task of proving their citizenship,” said Goswami.

Lamenting that so far only Muslim women have stepped out against the government’s move in large numbers, Goswami warned that the anti-CAA/NRC protests would not gain momentum unless women from other communities too join it.

Other leaders highlighted the deceptive nature of the CAA. They claimed that the CAA in its present form poses threat to the Constitution of India and sows seeds of discord between communities living harmoniously since ages.

Women leaders Shaheen Hakim, Nahida Kazi, Shaista Pathan, Shaheen Sheikh, Samina Sheikh, Dr Abhilash Gauture, Pragati Bhosle along with Prof Javed Pasha, Adv Farhat Baig and Amjad Sheikh also addressed the protesters.

Visakhapatnam: With the port city proposed to become the executive capital of the state, officials have started looking for a suitable location to house the DGP’s office. Till then, the new building of the police commissionerate , work on which began three years ago and has now been expedited, is likely to serve as the interim office of DGP Gautam Sawang till a permanent place is built.

The location of the DGP’s office would depend on where the government decides to set up the secretariat. Sawang’s present office in Mangalagiri town, near Guntur, is spread over six acres and is situated inside the sprawling sixth battalion of APSP (AP special police) premises. The five-storied building, with an area of over 1 lakh sqft, was constructed with an estimated cost of Rs 40 crore and inaugurated in August 2017.

The Vizag police commissioner’s office, which is under construction at police barracks, has four floors with an area of around 50,000 sqft. It is likely to be completed in the next four-five months. If the capital decentralisation proposal is passed in the assembly, around 15 IG and ADG rank officers, besides more than 400 ministerial staff, would be housed in this building.

City police chief Rajeev Kumar Meena said if the department needs it they would be happy to house the DGP’s interim office. “We expect the new building to be ready by June. But we haven’t got any communication in this regard ( DGP office ) so far,” he added.

VISAKHAPATNAM: The Greater Visakhapatnam Municipal Corporation (GVMC) is planning to construct four new 4-lane flyovers in Gajuwaka, Maddilapalem, Hanumanthuwaka and Car Shed junction near PM Palem on the NH to ease traffic congestion in the city. A rail overbridge at Gopalapatnam crossing is also on the cards. The GVMC is currently in the process of appointing a consultant to prepare a detailed project report for these projects.The Chennai-Kolkata national highway network from Kurmannapalem to Kommadi, spanning about 40 kilometres and passing through the core city, has been witnessing heavy traffic congestion. Some of the major intersections in this 40km network like Gajuwaka, NAD junction, Maddilapalem, New Venkojipalem junction, Hanumanthuwaka junction and Car Shed junction are struggling to cope with the increased vehicular traffic, which has grown manifold in the last one decade.To tide over the situation, Visakhapatnam Metropolitan Region Development Authority (VMRDA) has already started construction of a multi-level grade separator at NAD junction, the major bottleneck along the NH. Rs 120 crore will be spent on the project which is expected to be completed in the next four-five months.On the funding and completion deadline of the flyover projects, a GVMC official said they will explore the funding options only after the DPRs are prepared. “Once the DPRs are ready, we can take up these works in a phased manner or on an ‘as and when required’ basis,” he said. He added that the consultant has to prepare a feasibility study, soil analysis, cost and inception report, geotech report, designs, drawings, financial analysis etc for all the five locations.The consultant will also need to do a social and environmental impact assessment, traffic, land use and road inventory surveys, land acquisition proposals required for the project and utility shifting plans for each location, the GVMC official said. The consultant, while preparing the DPRs, should also consider the alignment of the proposed 140km metro rail project, besides assisting the civic body in bidding process and other works, he added.",visakhapatnam,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73836338,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-304597,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/civic-body-mulls-four-new-flyovers-to-ease-traffic-in-city/articleshow/73815748.cms

Kerala governor Arif Mohammed Khan (File photo)

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The Kerala assembly will not discuss the notice for resolution moved by the leader of opposition Ramesh Chennithala asking the President to recall governor Arif Mohammed Khan over his stand on the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, sources said.

The matter was taken up by the Business Advisory Committee (BAC) of the House on Friday and it was decided not to take up the matter for discussion. “The opposition had asked for time to discuss the content of the resolution. The BAC came to the conclusion that due to the short session of the assembly there was lack of time to discuss the matter,” assembly sources said.

The government had not agreed to the content of the debate, the sources said, adding in effect the discussion will not happen. The resolution had sought recall of the governor for “violating all democratic principles and publicly questioning the pride of the legislature”.

Law minister A K Balan told reporters that the government wishes to go only by rules and did not want to go against the spirit of the constitution.

Assembly Speaker P Sreeramakrishnan earlier had held that the notice for UDF resolution was permissible under law and a final call will be taken after discussing it in the BAC.

Reacting to the development, Chennithala said he would demand discussing the matter in the BAC once more.

The government decision was a challenge to the people of the state, he said. “If this government respected the people's sentiments, it would have allowed the discussion on the resolution,” he added.

Visakhapatnam: With the city on its way to become the executive capital of Andhra Pradesh, officials of the prison department are chalking out plans to run the headquarters of the prison department from Vizag Central Prison temporarily.

Currently, the department is headquartered in Amaravati. The department of prisons in Andhra Pradesh is divided into two— coastal Andhra and Kadapa ranges. Each range is headed by deputy inspector general (DIG) of prisons.

While one of the headquarters is located at Rajahmundry in East Godavari district, the other is located in Kadapa in Rayalaseema.

Speaking to TOI, a senior official of the prison department said that if the capital is shifted from Amaravati to Visakhapatnam, the central prison located in Adavivaram area in Visakhapatnam will be the headquarters temporarily.

As per the preliminary plan, the office of the director general of prisons and correctional services will function from the guest house of the department, located near the central prison. It is being expected that at least 50 officers from Amaravati will be shifted to Visakhapatnam.

Meanwhile, once the city becomes the executive capital, the prison department is expected to be set up in Bheemili in the area where the unused Bheemili sub-jail now stands, the official informed.

Work is also on for a Borstal School at Kondavelagada village under Nellimarla mandal in Vizianagaram district. This will be the first Borstal School in Andhra Pradesh and is expected to house 100 inmates. The school is expected to be inaugurated in the coming months, informed Dr Indla Sreenivasa Rao, DIG of prisons, coastal Andhra range.

The state government has allotted over 25 acres land at Kondavelagada for setting up a Borstal School and a new district jail in Vizianagaram in 2017. The entire project will cost the exchequer around Rs 20 crore.

“The state government had planned to set up a prison either in Vijayawada or in Amaravati for it felt that the capital should have a prison. However, now the government seems to have dropped the proposal due to the three-capital theory,” said another senior official.

Nagpur: Devotion to Mary , the mother of Jesus, is as ancient as Christianity itself. This is because God himself has shown through many signs that Mother Mary, as she is known, is the greatest of all saints ever born.

Her apparitions have been most common in the world. Of the most popular of her apparitions was the one at Lourdes, France, where she appeared as a little girl named Bernadette several times and gave messages to her and the world. She cured many sick. Mother Mary is honoured in the city at Lourd Mata Grotto.

The annual feast, known as Lourd Mata Mahotsav, commenced with the hoisting of a flag at Seminary Hills grotto on Thursday. The theme of the flag hoisting was ‘Mary, star of evangelization’ and it was conducted by St Francis De Sales Cathedral.

In preparation of the annual feast that will be celebrated on February 9, Novena prayers are scheduled for nine days at 6.30am and 5.30pm, respectively.

Churches from around the city will organize novena prayers on the themes like repentance, Marian devotion, holy Eucharist, our lady of good health, pray the rosary for world peace, return to God in love, immaculate, the brown scapular and universal motherhood.

Novena prayers will be held at St Antony’s Church, St Pius X Church, Our Lady of Fatima Church, Infant Jesus Church, Holy Family Church, Queen of the Apostles Church, and others.

477,['1/02/2020'],Road accidents: Cashless hosp support without time limit likely,"This story is from February 1, 2020

NEW DELHI: The government is likely to provide free and cashless treatment facility to road accidents victims till their condition stabilises rather than setting any time limit such as first 24 or 48 hours. The road transport ministry is currently framing the rules under the amended Motor Vehicle Act to provide quick and seamless access to accident victims under the Cashless Treatment Scheme.

Sources said a panel set up by the road transport ministry is working on the definition of “golden hour” and how a Motor Vehicle Accident Fund will be created to take care of treatment of injured persons and compensation to kin of a person who died in a hit and run case. The issue of nation-wide rollout of cashless treatment of accident victims came up for discussion at a conference on vehicle insurance last week.

TOI has learnt that the government is exploring different options to get enough fund in the corpus and methods to replenish it to meet the requirement. One of the options is to provide seed money and then allowing insurance companies and corporates to contribute for this cause. “The idea is to ensure that no road accident victim is denied of getting treatment, if he/ she is transported to a hospital. While the expenses of those having insurance cover can be borne by the insurer company concerned and this can be settled easily, options are being explored whether government insurance schemes such as Ayushman Bharat and PM Suraksha Bima Yonja can be linked to this scheme,” said a source.

According to a Law Commission of India report, nearly 50% of those killed in road accidents could be saved by providing timely medical assistance. In 2018, over 1.51 lakh persons lost their lives in road accidents.

NEW DELHI: Use of mobile phone “solely for navigation” while driving won’t attract fine, the road transport ministry has proposed in an amendment to the Motor Vehicle (Driving) Regulations. The ministry has also proposed another change, giving option of carrying documents in “physical or electronic form” instead of the original ones.

Mobile phones will be allowed with a rider that device doesn’t disturb the driver’s concentration. Currently, the law prohibits use of “any hand-held mobile phone or other communication device” while driving. It also says that no trainer or supervisor shall use a mobile phone or other communication device while training or supervising a learner driver. Sources said the changes are being made considering that in most cases, drivers are using mobile phones for navigation .

Director General of Police and chairman of Telangana Road Safety Authority T Krishna Prasad said CCTV cameras can’t capture whether a driver is using a phone only for navigation or talking, if it is put on the dashboard. “If one is holding it and making a call while driving, cameras can catch it. At a time when we are going for IT-based enforcement, it’s better to allow only in-built navigation feature provided by the vehicle manufacturers. While framing any rules, we need to see how and whether it can be enforced,” he said.

Regarding documents, the onus will be on traffic police or the transport department. “After inspection of the documents in electronic form, if they are found to be valid and in force, physical forms of such documents shall not be demanded for inspection, including in cases where there is an offence made out necessitating seizure of any such documents,” the draft notification said.

Farmers in villages of Khanapur taluk have incurred massive losses owing to raids by elephants on their fields

Belagavi: In a bid to escalate a local problem to the highest echelons of the government, the children of sugarcane farmers have written to Prime Minister Narendra Modi , seeking his intervention to solve the persistent problem of elephants invading their fields in the Mahadayi River basin in Belagavi.

Elephants camping on the banks of the River Mahadayi in Khanapur taluk have been raiding sugarcane fields for the past three months, leaving a trail of destroyed produce in their wake. The elephants are reportedly camping near Maskenahatti, Gastooli, Karikatte, Chunchavad, Goravanki and other neighbouring villages in the taluk. Sources said that most of the elephants were in Maskenahatti. The failure of the officials of the forest department to address this problem has left sugarcane farmers in these villages clutching a massive loss.

Children of these farmers, most of whom are teenagers grew increasingly frustrated with their inability to help parents. Despairing over the plight of their parents, these tech-savvy teenagers decided to communicate their pressing concerns to PM Modi. Using the ‘ MyGrievance ’ app, the children have sought to bring the problem of the Belagavi farmers to the notice of the PM, and are hoping that this will result in the officials concerned being directed to take necessary measures to put an end to the menace.

Jothibs Bendigeri, one of the affected farmers, said that he had been losing sleep for the past three months lest his fields be raided by the jumbos at night. “Initially, we had no inkling as to what was under way, and it was only when we found dung on our farms that we realised that elephants were raiding the fields. We have run into elephants on numerous occasions and have frightened them away using firecrackers,” said Bendigeri.

Another farmer lashed out at the forest department for their failure to understand the gravity of the problem, and take corrective measures. “All of us appealed to the department, asking the officials to come up with a permanent solution, but we did not get a positive response. The elephants have destroyed some amount of paddy crop as well,” he rued.

Nikhil Gundapakar, Sanjay Marapkar, Girish Kolkar and Praveen Bhalbar are the four teenagers who have brought this issue to the notice of the PM. They said that an acknowledgement had been sent from the Prime Minister’s Office confirming the receipt of their plaint. “We have requested the PM to install solar fences on the borders of the forest to prevent elephants from invading our villages,” they said.

Range forest officer Shreekant K, while admitting to the prevalence of the problem, said that the department was putting its best foot forward to tackle the menace. “We have already installed a 12v solar fence in some spots and have loud speakers to ward off elephants. The villagers must cooperate with us to in solving the problem,” Shreekant told TOI.

483,['1/02/2020'],300 long-route buses to operate from new Hosur terminal in Hubballi from next week,"This story is from February 1, 2020

Hubballi: The swank bus interchange terminal at Hosur will be inaugurated on Sunday and within a week, about 300 long-route buses will originate from here. Currently, the buses operate from the Old Bus Stand, leading to heavy congestion.

The new terminal, with modern passenger amenities, has been developed at a cost of Rs 60 crore under the BRTS project. It comprises 28 platforms, including six for BRTS feeder buses. The terminal has six lifts, two escalators and four air-conditioned lounges . The terminal was to be operational last year but was delayed due to technical reasons, sources said.

“Once the Hosur terminal is inaugurated on Sunday, the formalities for shifting long-route buses will be expedited. Within a week, all long-route buses will be diverted to Hosur from the Old Bus Stand,” Santosh Kumar, chief traffic manager of NWKRTC’s Hubballi division told TOI.

For some years now, the Old Bus Stand had been grappling with increasing traffic. Long-route buses bound for various destinations from Hubballi go via the Old Bus Stand from New Bus Stand as passengers were reluctant to travel to the latter to board the buses. This led to traffic congestion and huge crowds at the Old Bus Stand as it handled hundreds of trips every single day.

With the new terminal in operation, buses bound for Koppal, Raichur, Kalaburagi, Gadag, Bagalkot, Vijayapura, Davangere and Haveri, among other routes, will originate from here. In the first phase, 300 long-route buses will be shifted; this will not include those bound for Bengaluru. In the later phases, Kumar said, roads will be upgraded and all buses will be shifted to Hosur.

Eventually, the terminal is also likely to serve as an interchange for city-bound buses.

“Over the next week, we will announce and publicise the shifting of about 300 long-route buses to Hosur so that passengers are not inconvenienced or caught off-guard,” Kumar said. “Once the terminal starts functioning, we will monitor it closely to deal with other problems that might rise, such as a potential bottleneck at Hosur junction,” he said.

484,['1/02/2020'],"Delay in widening of Dharwad road frustrates residents, increases health hazards","This story is from February 1, 2020

Dharwad: Residents are understandably growing more frustrated with the delay in completion of work on a project to widen the road between Alur Venkatrao Circle and Narendra Cross in Dharwad. The authorities have been dragging their feet on the project, and this thoroughfare, formerly a stretch of the National Highway-4 but now a part of the state highway linking Dharwad and Belagavi, is among the busiest roads in the city and ongoing work has resulted in the creation of additional bottlenecks along the way.

Unsurprisingly, pedestrians have had to bear the brunt of the mess. Throughout the day, clouds of dust hang above the surface of the road making travel on the thoroughfare a hazardous exercise, considering that it exposes commuters to a host of pulmonary disorders. Reports of accidents on the road have only served to make residents more apprehensive about using the road.

The district administration appealed to Union minister for road transport and highways Nitin Gadkari to approve the widening of the 5.62km-stretch after operations started at the completed central bus stand in Dharwad. The central government subsequently greenlighted the project and work commenced two-and-a-half years ago. The Centre sanctioned Rs 78 crore towards the project, while entrusting the responsibility of executing it to the state government.

Inspecting the condition of the road in September last year, Union minister for parliamentary affairs and Dharwad MP Pralhad Joshi attributed the delay in its completion to the JD(S)-Congress coalition government ’s lackadaisical attitude towards the project.

On the other hand, officials charged with the responsibility of executing the project on the ground said that relocation of utilities at key nodes between Alur Venkatrao Circle and KVG Bank was to blame for the delay. The authorities are widening the stretch from one edge to the other since they are keen on avoiding acquisition of land. “Pavements will be built on either side of the thoroughfare, which will be a four-lane road once completed,” said an official.

Although Joshi had asked the authorities concerned to complete the project before the start of 2020, the road is yet to be widened between Kittur Channamma Park and Alur Venkatrao Circle. Meanwhile, doctors are growing increasingly worried about the consequences that the constant exposure to dust is likely to have on the health of regular road users.

Dr Shivkumar Mankar, a district surgeon Dr Kavita Kore, a pulmonologist, said that they received thousands of patients complaining of breathing troubles and skin problems contracted owing to the amount of time spent on the roads.

Besides the road users, inhabitants of houses on roads living on the road, and those running commercial establishments are among those fed up with the delay in the completion of the project. “We have to close our doors and windows throughout the day to prevent inhaling the dusty air,” said Krishnamurthy, who owns a shop on the road.

485,['1/02/2020'],Mega meet on February 2 to push demand for Yeragera taluk,"This story is from February 1, 2020

Raichur: The clamour for a separate taluk in Yeragera is likely to shift political gears with a public gathering on February 2 to chart out a strategy to step up pressure on the government. Campaigners say the region has lagged behind, especially on education and irrigation, as the administration is centred at Raichur .

Scores of residents of Yeragera and Gillesugur hoblis are expected to gather for the brainstorming with panchayat members and political leaders.

The proposed taluk would be the eighth in the district, alongside Raichur, Manvi, Devadurga, Sindhanur, Lingasugur, Maski and Sirwar. Yeragera and Gillesugur together have a population of nearly 1.4 lakh. Residents say they have to travel to the Raichur taluk headquarters for all government-related work, leading to delays and loss of work days.

Raichur is about 25km from Yeragera while the residents of Gillesugur have to travel about 42km one way.

“There is no office of the education department here due to which the sector is lagging. School buildings are in poor shape and the shortage of teachers is worse here compared to other areas in the district,” said MD Nizamuddin, who is spearheading the movement for a separate taluk. “Government school children are missing out on quality education due to this apathy and neglect. A dedicated block education officer can ensure students get the attention they deserve.”

Laxmipati, who is also part of the movement, said there are 16 gram panchayats in Yeragera and Gillesugur border areas of Andhra Pradesh but even for an encumbrance certificate, villagers have to travel to Raichur. “The taluk headquarters is about 45km from villages like Talamari but there is no other option. Farmers need the certificate to avail loans,” said Laxmipati. “These hoblis need a tahsildar office, block education office, sub-registrar office and other government facilities at Yeragera hobli headquarters. This will improve their lives.”

Activist Syed Hafizullah said since 1998, water from the Tungabhadra does not reach the canal. “Villages falling along the Tungabhadra Left Bank Canal (TLBC) and arable lands are notified for irrigation. But people are now forced to depend on groundwater for both irrigation and drinking. If we get a separate taluk, we can voice our demand strongly to bring water to the tail-end of TLBC,” he said.

Raichur has a population of over 5 lakh while other taluks have over 2 lakh people each and this has led to disproportionate attention to these areas, added Hafizullah. “Most facilities are denied to people living in the far-flung areas of Raichur taluk. To sort this out, a new taluk is the need of the hour.”

MUMBAI: China’s coronavirus outbreak has resulted in stocks of N95 masks disappearing from chemist shops in Mumbai, but doctors say the high-end mask may not be as effective as presumed. Moreover, it may be unnecessary outside healthcare settings and hospitals.“Only people in healthcare settings who are going to be constantly around infected people need an N95 mask,” said infectious diseases specialist Dr Om Srivastava.Experts say data from China suggests the virus, when airborne, can go a distance of up to three feet as it is relatively large. Chennai-based internal medicine specialist Dr V Ramasubramanian said he doesn’t advise the general public to use a mask at all. “Only if you travel to an affected zone, use a triple-layered surgical mask,” he said. Infectious diseases specialist Dr George Oomen said just this preventive measure isn’t enough: “One also needs to wash hands regularly.” Doctors say washing hands frequently to break any transmission chain — such as an infected person touching lift buttons, door knobs or computer keyboards — could be the most effective preventive method.Dr Oomen pointed to a 2019 study published in Journal of American Medical Association which showed that facemask type didn’t make a big difference in the spread of flu. The study among 2,862 medical health workers across seven health centres in the US concluded that “wearing N95 respirators versus medical masks” resulted in no significant difference in the incidence of lab-confirmed influenza.In another study published in the Journal of the American Dental Association in 2009, surgical masks appeared to be nearly as effective as N95 respirators in preventing influenza among healthcare workers in Canada. Between September and December 2008, influenza occurred among 24% nurses in the surgical mask group and 23% in the N95 group.“There is no need to panic and rush to buy masks. This isn’t ebola. It is a coronavirus outbreak that should die down in the coming weeks if not in a month,” said Dr Parvaiz Kaul, head, pulmonary medicine department, Shere-i-Kashmir Hospital, Srinagar. He said the virus’s genetic code is already known and vaccines and drugs are in the pipeline. “There also are reports from Wuhan about patients responding to anti-HIV medication nelfinavir and lopinavir,’’ he said.",mumbai,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73823182,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-572580,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/coronavirus-outbreak-heavy-duty-n95-mask-not-necessary-outside-hospitals/articleshow/73823177.cms
487,['1/02/2020'],SC notice to UP on plea against riot damages,"This story is from February 1, 2020

Supreme Court of India

NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Friday issued notice to the Uttar Pradesh government on a plea seeking quashing of notices sent to alleged protesters by district administration for recovering losses caused by damage to public properties during the anti-CAA agitation in the state.

A bench of Justices D Y Chandrachud and K M Joseph sought response from the UP government on a petition alleging that the state administration had issued notices in “illegal and arbitrary” manner. The petitioner alleged that recovery notice was issued to “harass innocent people” and pointed out that notice was also issued to a person who had died six years ago.

The counsel appearing for petitioner Parwaiz Arif Titu said notices were issued as per the Allahabad High Court judgement delivered in 2010 but the verdict is itself “in violation of the guidelines” laid down by the top court in a 2009 verdict which was later reaffirmed in a 2018 order.

The petitioner contended that the state government has appointed additional district magistrate to deal with the process of notices for recovering damages but as per the apex court guidelines, a sitting or retired HC judge or a sitting or retired district judge should be first appointed as a claims commissioner to estimate the damages and investigate liability.

“The contradiction is that while the Supreme Court in 2009 put the onus of assessment of damages and recovery from the accused on high courts, the Allahabad High Court had issued guidelines in 2010 that let the state government undertake these processes to recover damages, which has serious implications,” the petition said.

MUMBAI: Electric bikes will soon provide last-mile connectivity at Bandra-Kurla Complex , Bandra and Kurla with the Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority ( MMRDA ) planning to roll out the project on a pilot basis in partnership with the bike operator.MMRDA and Yulu Bikes on Friday signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) in the presence of chief minister Uddhav Thackeray and public works department minister Eknath Shinde.As per the MoU, the e-bike operator will provide a total of 500 e-bikes at 25 different locations in BKC and at Bandra(E) and Kurla stations, where commuters can avail the facility 24x7.An MMRDA spokesperson said, “Since the bike has been categorized as nonmotorized transport, users will not require a licence.”As per the initial plan, the fare system will be Rs10 to unlock the bike and Rs 10 for every 10 minutes. Various recharge vouchers will be available with benefits thrown in for ‘loyal’ customers. Commuters will have to drop the e-bikes at designated docking stations at the three locations. The operation of these e-bikes is entirely app-based.Shinde said, “MMRDA is committed to the objective of providing last-mile connectivity and the operator will provide a public bike-sharing system in Bandra-Kurla Complex, Bandra (east) and Kurla (west) suburban railway stations.”Metropolitan commissioner R A Rajeev said, “The MMRDA will scale up the service in future for all Metro lines. This initiative will improve not only firstand last-mile connectivity, but also extend the reach of public transport to promote space efficiency, improve urban environment, reduce congestion and improve air quality.”The lightweight bikes —claimed to be lighter than a scooter and faster than a bicycle—are designed for urban traffic conditions with a maximum speed of 25 kmph.Commenting on the move, Kurla resident Roy Jacob said, “It is a good initiative, but the MMRDA should ensure only those above 18 years of age are allowed to ride these bikes as teenagers could end up using them to do stunts, thereby causing mishaps and derailing the novel project.”",mumbai,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73823198,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-742039,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-soon-take-an-e-bike-to-your-bkc-office/articleshow/73823193.cms

NEW DELHI: The Special Investigation Team (SIT) probing cases of clashes at Jamia Millia Islamia on December 15, arrested a youth — Illyas — who was seen in a photograph throwing a burning tyre at policemen .

Police sources said that Illyas worked at a wheel alignment workshop in a petrol pump near Amar Colony. He was caught from Garhi village where he stayed with a relative.

During questioning, Illyas said that he had joined the protests along with two of his friends. When the protesters were marching, someone had spread rumours about cops opening fire on the protesters due to which seven people had been allegedly killed. This allegedly made the protesters violent and during this police started dispersing them. Illyas was caught on camera setting fire to a discarded tyre and throwing it at the policemen. Cops are probing whether he had carried the tyre along with him and waiting for violence to break out. He was being questioned regarding his role.

Police sources said that Illyas was one of the protesters whose photo was published in a notice along with 68 others by the SIT earlier this week. In the notice, cops had appealed to the residents to identify the men from the images and report them to the SIT. Cops had also sought footage and photographs from all media houses to identify the rest of the troublemakers.

While the government expects 366 Indians evacuees on this flight, the exact number of evacuees will be known when boarding is completed.The special flight on Boeing 747 “Ajanta” had left Delhi at on Friday afternoon with four pilots, 15 cabin crew, a team of doctors from Delhi’s RML Hospital, medical equipment and other support staff. It landed there at 7.46 pm (Wuhan time), with the pilots exclaiming in the cockpit “khaali airport, khaali roads” during final approach to the ghost town — a bustling economic centre till a few days back. Ajanta was supposed to take off at 10 pm (IST). But till well past that time, boarding hadn’t begun as many of the evacuees had not reached the airport, said AI officials.This is the first of the evacuation flights by India and AI could operate the second one on Saturday. Special arrangements have been made at IGI Airport and no person and baggage from this aircraft will need to go inside the terminal. Ajanta will be parked at a remote bay (no aerobridge) where customs and immigration will set up special counters for doing the required clearance. Passengers will board an ITBP bus from the ramp and head to their quarantine centres. Crew and other personnel on this aircraft will also remain in isolation for about a week at their homes.With AI’s director (operations) Captain Amitabh Singh on board to supervise this evacuation flight, the 423-seater aircraft took off with four pilots — two commanders Captain Kamal Mohan, Captain S H Reza; and two first officers Captain Sanjay Achalkar and Captain Bhupesh Narain. Everyone onboard the Delhi-Wuhan flight wore full protective suit on landing in Wuhan, before opening the aircraft door there.“No service will take place on the flight. Food packets and water bottles will be kept on each. There will be no interaction (between cabin crew and passengers),” said an AI official. Two lavs will be kept only for crew. AI chairman Ashwani Lohani , who was at Delhi Airport to meet the crew of this special flight, said masks have been arranged for the crew and passengers. “For our crew, we have also arranged complete protective gear,” he said.All the personnel volunteered for this flight, and subsequent ones, despite the risk of spending hours with possibly infected people in the closed environ of an aircraft, with cash-starved AI — which is unable to pay salaries on time — carrying out this operation from its resources. To be sure, all the crew and other staff will wear full protective gear during the flight back to India.Lohani tweeted: “The national carrier once again comes to the rescue - this time to evacuate Indians from Wuhan, the site of the outbreak of coronavirus. This mission begins today with a Jumbo 747 operating between Delhi and Wuhan.

The owner of the printing press will soon be detained for questioning.According to police sources, Sharjeel told the cops during questioning that the road blockade at Kalindi Kunj and putting women at the forefront were part of a strategy. He had studied several protests across the world, and was influenced by some social science theory, they claimed.Sharjeel was being questioned by a joint team of the crime branch and the special cell.
