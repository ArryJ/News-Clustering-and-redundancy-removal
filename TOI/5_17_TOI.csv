His Telugu song Butta Bomma has become a viral craze - especially during the lockdown. He was also the first Indian singer-songwriter to be featured on the Times Square Billboard for his English debut, Control . He chats about music, his love for languages and the lockdown in a video interview.I have been very busy making a lot of new music. I have also been promoting my music, especially my English single - Control. With video interviews and everything going digital, I am trying to get used to the new normal.I have a home studio, where I have been creating new music and singing new songs. Film song work is on hold due to the current situation. But I am looking at releasing a lot of non-film songs in English and Hindi in the next few months. I have been quite busy keeping my creative juices flowing. It is a little tough to keep myself inspired, given what is going on around us, but I am trying my best.I find inspiration from my parents and home. All of us are going through a lot and the only thing that can help me escape from a sad situation is music. It has always been a saviour for me. It has been the same for many listeners to. I just need to play a chord on my guitar or a note on my piano and it changes my mood and inspires me to do something.There were comments that said it is unbelievable to see an Indian singer singing so well in English. People have this notion that Indian singers can't really pronounce English words well or can't sing as well as the Westerners. But I think that's a compliment that I really liked, as it was also one of the things I wanted to debunk. A lot of Indian singers who sing in English are not taken as seriously because of that notion. If that changes with this song, then I am glad. I have always wanted to break out as a global singer and Control did that. As an Indian singer, we don't get as many opportunities and I had to literally create this for myself.I had lost touch of producing music. Luckily, my home studio got done before the lockdown. So, all the equipment was there. I have always wanted to create beats and produce new music, but I was busy either touring or recording songs. This lockdown has helped me reignite some lost passions and music production is definitely one of them. I've also started meditating. There are good things and bad things that this lockdown has brought. The bad things include the stress and anxiety. The good things, of course, include the fact that it has helped us do things we have always wanted to do.I have been doing guided meditation online. Then there are a few playlists called Calm and Sleep. I listen to them before sleeping. I have trouble drifting off, like a lot many around us, as our sleep cycles are ruined. So, I listen to these soft playlists just before sleeping, as it calms my mind down.Honestly, I have been waiting for something like Butta Bomma to happen. I have been an active regional language singer. I have always considered myself an Indian singer and not just a part of the Bollywood playback scene. I was waiting for a regional song to become a national hit. Now, because David Warner and Kevin Pietersen danced to it, it has become a crossover global hit as well. It’s amazing how a song unites the whole country, irrespective of the language it is in. I knew this song was catchy and peppy, but I never knew it would become such a big hit. Every day, I am discovering newer things that are making it an even more monumental hit than it already is. Kudos to composer SS Thaman and Allu Arjun , who is magnificent in the video.I think I have this natural gift, I can't really explain it to people; maybe it’s the way I’m wired. There's no process that I have followed. I have been singing in different languages for as long as I can remember. When I was 10, I would sing ad jingles in Hindi. The producers would then ask me if I could also sing them in Tamil or Telugu. It used to come out perfectly. That was when I got the confidence. Over the years, my diction started improving. I began understanding a few words here and there. I still do not understand all the languages that I sing in. I learn about the song and the lyrics just before I get into the recording booth to understand its feel.I have favourites in different languages. In Hindi, Tiger Shroff pulls off my voice really well on screen. Allu Arjun in the Telugu film industry. In Kannada, it has to be Sudeep and Darshan.",entertainment,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-75779831,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-111932/75779831.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/kannada/music/armaan-malik-talks-about-the-viral-hit-butta-bomma-and-his-new-music/articleshow/75779831.cms
1,['17/05/2020'],National portal to track migrants' movement by trains and buses,"NEW DELHI: A central online repository on migrant workers moving by Shramik Special trains and buses to reach their native places has been developed by National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) to facilitate their seamless movement across states and also help the sending and receiving states use the ‘National Migrant Information System (NMIS)' dashboard for better coordination, movement monitoring and contact tracing.In a letter sent to all chief secretaries on Saturday, home secretary Ajay Bhalla urged them to use the online portal NMIS for capturing the information on movement of migrants and for better inter-state coordination.States can upload batch file of individual migrants' data on the portal. As many states have already collected migrant data, this can be integrated through Application Programming Interface, Bhalla told the chief secretaries. The key data pertaining to the persons migrating has been standardised for uploading such as name, age, mobile no, aadhaar number, originating & destination district, persons accompanying, date of travel etc, which states are already collecting.States/UTs, Ministry of Railways and other stakeholders would be able to access the portal for decision support.By having all information relating to movement of migrants -- each to whom will be allowed a unique ID to be used for all transactions -- on a single online platform, states will be able to visualise how many people are going out from where and how many are reaching the destination states. The mobile numbers of people can be used for contact tracing and movement monitoring during Covid-19, said Bhalla.The portal will enable the receiving state/district to ask for and give their acceptance in an online format seamlessly. This system will help in speedy communication between states without creating additional work at the level of the field officers. It has additional advantages like contact tracing, said the home secretary.There are many issues involved in the movement of migrants including contact tracing, planning of trains, planning of quarantine facilities in destination states, planning of return when the migrants want to return etc. ""So far, it is expected that about 3.5 lakh migrant workers have been moved in 350 trains. More such journeys are being planned. Further to provide facility of contact tracing, both individual particulars and spatial identifiers (origin, destination address) need to be captured. A ready database can be of help in planning such return Journeys in a systematic manner,"" said the home secretary.NMIS portal will have various dashboards such as public dashboard, logistic management, risk index, and quarantine alert etc which are being used by states for containment of spread of corona virus.Listing the benefits of NMIS, the home ministry letter said that as the transportation levels of migrant workers increase, manual system will become difficult to implement and may lead to delays. On line centralised portal will give seamless connectivity.NDMA central repository can be used to plan and also keep in touch with the migrants for giving them benefits by states (if any), or plan their return journeys.",india,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-75782441,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-379804,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/national-portal-to-track-migrants-movement-by-trains-and-buses/articleshow/75782413.cms

3,['17/05/2020'],IOA wants plan B in place for delayed infrastructure,"Panaji: It’s not really a surprise that the Indian Olympic Association (IOA) do not believe in the timelines set by Goa for the 36th edition of National Games , scheduled to be held later this year.There have been so many postponements since the Games were allotted in 2008 that one has lost count, and with the Games now just five months away – unless postponed again – the IOA is understandably jittery.The IOA has demanded monthly progress reports from the state government, and with Goa delaying in sending these reports –because no work has taken place due to the coronavirus pandemic –IOA has been forced to send reminders, according to information made available to TOI.There are question marks whether, despite the umpteen postponements, Goa will be able to meet the deadlines to complete the necessary infrastructure.Mukesh Kumar, chairman of the games technical conduct committee (GTCC), has sought progress report on five projects which are found to have been lagging behind. The swimming pool (Campal), tennis facility (Fatorda), hockey turf-ground (Peddem), squash courts (Chicalim) and lawn bowl facility (Chicalim) have all seen delays. The turf at Peddem has to be re-laid after being found faulty.“All infrastructure work needs to be completed before the start of the rainy season in July. A detailed report on the above (five projects) is required as GTCC would like to explore ""Plan B"" for the above facilities (in case there are problems in timely completion of the infrastructure),” Kumar said in an email to VM Prabhu Desai, executive director of Sports Authority of Goa (SAG) and joint CEO for the National Games.The IOA has also raised concerns over procurement of sports equipment.“It has been observed that the work orders for procurement of equipment for nine sports disciplines has only been issued so far. The decision on procurement of all other disciplines is still pending on account of one or the other reason.“This issue has been highlighted by GTCC many a time in the past, and it was conveyed that by March/April end all sports equipment will be procured by the organising committee. The progress in this regard is not satisfactory,” said Kumar.The state government, on its part, said all infrastructure will be completed by August 30 after some of the timelines were being reworked “considering suggestions at the stadium by various stakeholders.”The problem of procurement of sports equipment, too, has been sorted, according to the organising committee.“All required formalities for crucial sports equipment that was to be imported have been completed. The rest of the equipment is to be domestically procured, the processes are much easier and can be operated with a fixed window period,” Prabhu Desai said in his email to IOA last week.Prabhu Desai also said ten hotels having a capacity to serve about 1000 persons on a daily basis have been provisionally reserved for the Games.The National Games are scheduled to be held from October 20 to November 4.",goa,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-47529300,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-110164,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/ioa-wants-plan-b-in-place-for-delayed-infrastructure/articleshow/75782587.cms
4,['17/05/2020'],135 BSF personnel recovered from Covid-19,"NEW DELHI: In a heartening turnaround, number of daily recoveries of para-military personnel who were detected as Covid-19 positive, have begun to far exceed the new cases added everyday. This is true for BSF , CRPF and ITBP and comes after the ministry of health and family welfare recently relaxed its guidelines for discharge of Covid-19 patients from healthcare facilities.In BSF, 135 personnel have recovered so far, bringing down the number of active cases in the force to 208. Since Friday, 16 new Covid-positive cases were reported in the force. While 37 BSF personnel — including 24 in Tripura, 5 in Delhi, 6 in Kolkata and 2 in Tekanpur — were cured earlier, 98 more — 42 in Jodhpur , 31 in Tripura and 25 in Delhi — were discharged from the hospital on Friday after testing negative. The 98 have been placed under quarantine as per protocol.In CRPF, 44 personnel of the 31st battalion —which had turned a Covid-19 hotspot after many personnel tested positive — have recovered and been discharged. In contrast, only 5 positive cases were reported in the last 24 hours. Total recovered cases in CRPF now total 51, and active cases, 233.ITBP did not report a single new positive case in the past 24 hours. So far, 22 ITBP personnel who had contracted Corona virus have recovered. This brings down the tally of infected personnel in ITBP to 151.As per the new discharge policy framed by MoHFW, mild and pre-symptomatic Covid-positive patients can be discharged after 10 days (considering from the day symptoms appeared) if they did not have any fever for 3 days. Before the discharge, Covid-19 test (RT-PCR) is not performed. For moderate cases admitted to DCHC (Oxygen beds) too, no RT-PCR test will be done before discharge. If the fever resolves in three days and oxygen saturation is maintained above 95% for minimum 4 days, the patient can be discharged. Where the patient demands oxygen and fever is not resolved within 3 days, discharge can only be given after the clinical symptoms are resolved and the patient is able to maintain oxygen saturation for 3 consecutive days.",india,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-75782605,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-428569,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/135-bsf-personnel-recovered-from-covid-19/articleshow/75782500.cms

NEW DELHI: Union minister Ram Vilas Paswan on Saturday termed the instances of migrant workers walking back home and getting killed on road and rail track as ""terrible situation"".

The minister said now migrant workers desperately want to reach home and they are least bothered about work and food. “They will think about job once they are settled after reaching home,” Paswan said while referring to the telling photographs and videos of people walking hundreds of kilometers and mothers carrying children.

Paswan, who had earlier served as a railway minister, said there was a possibility that stranded migrants were following rail tracks since states have put restrictions on movement.

“The rail ministry has issued guideline to run Shramik Special trains to ferry stranded migrant labourers and these trains are plying. There are huge number of migrant labourers and the government is relaxing social distancing norms to transport more migrant workers in these trains. Despite this a large number of people are gathering outside stations and they are not sure whether they can return home,” the minister said.

Though both the Central and state governments have been appealing stranded migrant workers to stay where they are and not to walk on roads, a large number of labourers and daily wage earners are walking home with their families and belongings.

6,['17/05/2020'],Taliban accuses India of playing 'negative' role by supporting Kabul govt,"Representative image (File photo)

NEW DELHI: The Taliban has lashed out at India, accusing it of playing a “negative” role by supporting the government in Kabul .

In an interview to Azm, a news website, Sher Mohammad Abbas Stanekzai, deputy head of the Taliban's political office in Qatar and head of the negotiating team with the US, was quoted as saying that “if the Indian government wants to take positive steps in the Afghan peace process and in rebuilding a new Afghanistan, we are counting on it, but according to him, India has been inside Afghanistan for the last 40 years. It played a negative role and maintained economic, military and political ties with a ""corrupt"" group instead of the nation.”

Sources here said the recent urgent Khalilzad mission to New Delhi was not so much about asking India to talk to the Taliban, as to get New Delhi to persuade the Kabul government to release the Taliban prisoners. The Ghani government is believed to be dragging its feet, presumably, as sources say, because they don’t believe the Taliban is actually interested in an intra-Afghan dialogue.

In a recent interview to the Daily Times of Pakistan , Stanekzai asserted, “Intra-Afghan cannot start unless 5000 of our prisoners are released and there would be no ceasefire and reduction in violence unless intra-Afghan dialogue starts. The US and the Kabul administration are responsible for this situation.”

In a recent press conference, Zalmay Khalilzad underscored the importance of the release of prisoners, which appears to be becoming a deal-breaker. “We have pushed to get both sides, the Afghan Government and the Taliban, to release prisoners. Already some 1,011 prisoners have been released by the government, Talib prisoners, and 253 Afghan Government prisoners have been released by the Taliban.""

India’s point to the Khalilzad delegation was that India could help only if India was in the room on Afghanistan’s future. The US, according to India, has been playing the Pakistani game by keeping India out of recent consultations on Afghanistan’s future. That, according to Indians involved in Afghanistan has been the US game for years now. India has resisted US pressure before, and they say, unlikely to give up its gains in Afghanistan at this point, when the game is still open.

On talking to the Taliban, the Indian government remains cautious. Sources here say there are unofficial contacts with Taliban, but there appears to be no concerted view among the Taliban themselves about engaging with India. There are differences within the Taliban regarding India — therefore India is not going to rush in to start talking to the Taliban.

India is one of the most visible supporters of the Kabul government, both during Karzai’s time and now with Ghani. This has given India a good deal of leverage particularly when India has been kept out of regional formulations on Afghanistan’s future. To the clamour asking India to talk to the Taliban, Indian policy makers believe they have a stronger position being Afghanistan’s development partner, rather than making nice with a terror group like the Taliban, which continues to take orders from Pakistan.

The government in Kabul is convinced they would not survive if the Taliban were to take a piece of the power structure. In recent days, the Ghani government has been targeting both Taliban and ISKP positions. Taliban too have stepped up violence and refuse to consider a ceasefire before talks with the Afghan government, so as to maintain a position of strength.

In addition, the divisions between Ghani and Abdullah Abdullah have added to the inaction, say sources.

Stanekzai’s core complaint is directed against the US, which, he said had been unable to get the Kabul government to release the 5000 Taliban prisoners that had been promised as part of the peace deal with Zalmay Khalilzad. That was one of the big deliverables for the Taliban in the US peace deal. The Taliban prisoners were supposed to have been released by March 10, according to Stanekzai.

The US has gone out of its way to pin the responsibility of recent terror attacks on the ISKP, not the Taliban. Khalilzad said, “We believe that ISIS and the Taliban are mortal enemies, and in the war against ISIS, Taliban have played an important role. Of course, the government has as well, and we have played a vital role in that fight. And that fight is not finished, and we believe that our assessment currently is that the attacks that took place against the hospital and the attack in Nangarhar on a funeral procession was the work of ISIS...”

Indian officials remain sceptical — recent attacks on Indian interests, like the gurdwara in Kabul, showed that the planning of the attacks, execution and claiming responsibility were being done by the LET, Haqqanis and the ISKP respectively. This makes it difficult for India to believe the US when it says that Taliban and ISKP were “mortal” enemies.

7,['17/05/2020'],"For faster distribution of free pulses, Govt to give 'chana' to migrants","Representative image

NEW DELHI: The Centre on Saturday urged states and UTs to pick the 8 lakh tonnes of foodgrain from FCI expeditiously and distribute them to 8 crore migrants within next fortnight. Learning from the difficulties in free distribution of pulses , the Centre has decided to provide two kg “whole gram” (chana) for free to the migrants for May and June.

Chana can be distributed quickly as it doesn’t require milling. Union food and consumer affairs minister Ram Vilas Paswan said, “We are not seeking the details of beneficiary migrants who don’t have ration cards from the states as the focus is to bring quick relief to these vulnerable people. If we ask states to start identifying, it will take months,” Paswan told reporters through a video conference.

The food ministry has made the allocation of wheat and rice estimating that states would require around 10% more foodgrains of the allocation under National Food Security Act (NFSA).

So, while this extra free grain and pulses would benefit about 1.42 crore in Uttar Pradesh followed by Bihar (86.45 lakh) and Maharashtra (70 lakh). In West Bengal, the numbers are around 60.1 lakh.

Similarly, the estimated migrants to benefit in Madhya Pradesh is pegged at 54.64 lakh, followed by Rajasthan (44.66 lakh), Karnataka (40.19 lakh), Gujarat (38.25 lakh), Tamil Nadu (35.73 lakh), Jharkhand (26.37 lakh), Andhra Pradesh (26.82 lakh) and Assam (25.15 lakh). In Delhi, about 7.27 lakh migrants are likely to get free 5 kg food grains per person and 1 kg chana per family for May and June.

However, Paswan said Centre is ready to provide more foodgrain, if the numbers increase. But states will have to validate the numbers.

Responding to whether these 8 crore migrants would also be eligible to get ration cards, Paswan said the number on beneficiaries under NFSA has been fixed as per the 2011 Census. It will be reviewed again after 2021 Census and Niti Aayog will come out with the numbers.

Food secretary Sudhanshu Pandey said states can send their preference of grain by May 18 and states can directly supply free ration at shelter camps or issue distressed coupons as well.

She admits that staying put in one place for such a long period of time feels a little strange. “In fact, I have never spent so much time in Mumbai at a stretch,” she reveals. During the lockdown, she is trying to learn a few things from her mother, Rajani Bhatia. “I have also been working in the South Indian film industry for a while now and can speak Tamil and Telugu fluently, but not my mother tongue, Sindhi. So, these days I make it a point to talk to my mother in Sindhi. I am also learning to make some traditional dishes,” says the Baahubali actress.She adds, “I have realised that there is so much that we can learn from our parents, and can eventually pass on to the next generation. My mother is very spiritual and religious. These days, I often sit with her and try to learn and understand the scriptures. I can’t read as fast as she does, so I do it at my own pace while understanding the meaning of it all.”Though Tamannaah has her parents to keep her company, she says that she misses her brother, Anand, who stays in New York. Recently, she posted a throwback picture on social media, giving a glimpse of the bond that they share. She says, “While growing up, isn’t it everyone’s goal to irritate their sibling? My brother would watch wrestling matches on TV and try those moves on me. And my mom would freak out (laughs!).” Talking about her other family members, who live in the US, she adds, “Apart from Anand, we also have other family members living there, who are medical professionals and are at the frontline.

9,['17/05/2020'],"Govt opens doors to greater private role in defence, power, space","NEW DELHI: The government on Saturday announced a major opening up of defence production, power, space and coal and mining sectors for private participation as part of finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman ’s fourth set of announcements aimed at spurring investment and buffering the economy against the Covid-19 shock.Though the reform moves do not immediately address concerns over the need to spur demand, Sitharaman said steps to provide funds to MSMEs as well as tax refunds, which is money that belongs to taxpayers, and deferred payment will leave more money in the hands of individuals. Saturday’s measures were intended to signal India’s readiness to pro-actively seek investment and instil confidence in business circles.“I am not saying I have done everything possible, we are trying to help people so that they can have money in their hands now and that is definitely going to help in boosting demand,” she told reporters adding that the measures being announced by the government will create a better environment for investment and enable companies to get back to business as soon as the lockdown is relaxed.The reforms across several sectors, led by defence, have been previously discussed but the severe stress in the economy seems to have provided the goad to reconsider the reluctance to let in the private sector even in areas like space development. In a major boost for the ‘Make in India’ initiative, the government is now issuing a list of items where imports will be banned and indigenisation of spares promoted. Sitharaman said this list will be expanded every year.At the same time, to address concerns related to inadequate foreign-holding, the government has decided to increase the FDI limit for defence production under the automatic route to 74%, from the current 49%.Along with the defence sector, the government also decided to push privatisation of power distribution companies after a gap of over a decade and said discoms in Union Territories will be privatised, an experiment that has previously helped consumers in Delhi. The move will open lucrative markets such as Chandigarh and Pondicherry, with the possibility of power distribution in Jammu and Kashmir also being run by the private sector. But to ensure that consumers are not short-changed, the FM said the step will come with the new tariff policy, which will ensure that inefficiencies of discoms do not burden consumers.The move to privatise the discoms again signals the Modi administration’s efforts to get the government out of areas where it should not operate. While Air India and BPCL privatisation initiatives were steps in this direction, Covid-19 has impacted the initiative and the discom move is unlikely to see aggressive bidding, immediately.Nevertheless, the FM’s announcement to auction blocks for coal and other mining were again meant to attract private participation in areas which have hitherto been dominated by Coal India and other public sector entities. Some of the steps in mining and coal sector were a reiteration of earlier announcements although the government indicated that it will provide a fresh impetus to coal gassificaiton and coalbed methane extraction.A big change in policy came in the space sector, where the government for the first time announced its intent to allow the private sector to be a co-partner in future planetary exploration and outer space travel initiatives such as Chandrayaan and Mars mission. This came with the promise to provide a level-playing field for private companies in satellites, launches and space-based services.",india,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-75783025,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-331096,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/govt-opens-doors-to-greater-private-role-in-defence-power-space/articleshow/75783007.cms

KANPUR: Yet another desperate journey has ended in tragedy on the side of a highway. Twenty-six more migrant labourers fleeing joblessness and hunger will never see home again. They died when a trailer truck carrying sacks of lime and 50 people drove into the back of a stationary DCM truck carrying another 20 people on National Highway 19 in Auraiya district , Uttar Pradesh , around 3.15am on Saturday. Thirty-six were injured.

The DCM truck, carrying migrant workers from Ghaziabad, had stopped at a roadside eatery near Chirhauli village. The trailer truck driver didn’t see the stationary vehicle. He appeared to have fallen asleep, ASP Kamlesh Kumar Dikshit told TOI. The majority of the victims were those on the trailer truck.

Reports said that around 50 migrants on the trailer truck were from Bihar, Jharkhand, West Bengal and UP and had been travelling from Rajasthan. The DCM truck, carrying 20 migrant labourers, had been heading towards Sagar district of Madhya Pradesh.

Of the 36 injured, 20 were shifted to Saifai Medical University in Etawah as their condition was stated to be critical, while 16 were admitted to the district hospital in Auraiya.

Three SHOs, of Fatehpur Sikri-Agra, Kosi Kalan and Mathura, have been suspended with immediate effect on the directions of CM Yogi Adityanath who also sought reports from the SSP, IG, and the ADG.

On Friday, at least 15 migrant workers had been killed in three separate incidents in UP, Madhya Pradesh and Bihar. The UP government had announced on Friday that district authorities must ensure that migrant workers do not walk or cycle home and are provided transport.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Adityanath and leaders of several opposition parties expressed grief over the loss of life. The CM has announced an ex gratia of Rs 2 lakh for the families of the deceased and Rs 50,000 for the injured.

“The trailer truck was also carrying migrant labourers from Jaipur and Bharatpur districts of Rajasthan to UP’s Kushinagar, Bihar, Jharkhand and West Bengal. The DCM truck was carrying labourers from Delhi via Ghaziabad and was heading towards Sagar via Auraiya district,” ASP Kamlesh Dikshit said.

“The trailer truck collided with the DCM from behind. The impact was so severe that both vehicles overturned and fell into a roadside ditch. Nearly 42 labourers sitting on the trailer and 20 on the DCM truck were injured. Of them, 26 died before reaching hospital,” Dikshit added.

IGP Mohit Agarwal said the police would investigate why so many people were travelling on just two vehicles.

The accident spot was littered with backpacks and belongings of the dead and the injured. A senior police officer said many labourers were crushed to death under sacks of lime. The bodies have been sent for post-mortem and efforts are on to contact their family members.

Auraiya DM Abhishek Singh said investigations were on to establish the exact cause of the accident. “As of now we have been able to ascertain the identities of 18 victims. The identities of seven others are yet to be ascertained,” Singh added.

An official said the 26 deceased included 12 migrant labourers from Jharkhand. “The death toll is likely to go up,” he said.

The CM directed senior officials to visit the site. “The chief minister has also directed that all the injured be provided medical care immediately and the commissioner and IG Kanpur visit the site and immediately file a report on the cause of the accident,” said UP additional chief secretary (home) Awanish Awasthi.

Opposition politicians, including BSP chief Mayawati, SP’s Akhilesh Yadav and Congress’ Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, questioned the government over the accident.

This announcement comes as a huge blow to the 20,000-odd people working in the industry, who are already grappling with uncertain future since shootings came to a halt on March 18. However, other popular channels told CT that they are ready to resume shooting once the restrictions are lifted. “The post-production work has already started at some places, but we don’t know when we can start shooting again. The lockdown has to be lifted for that to happen,” said president of Federation of Cine Technicians and Workers of Eastern India (FCTWEI) Swarup Biswas.Meanwhile, considering the growth in television viewership — with more children and male viewers tuning in — channels said that the industry will not be the same again and some serials will be replaced to make space for new content based on changing demand.

12,['17/05/2020'],Delhi: Series of quakes danger sign? Experts debate,"Representative image

NEW DELHI: Are four minor earthquakes in Delhi in almost a month a sign of danger for the region? Officials at the National Centre for Seismology (NCS) do not believe so, saying Delhi is unlikely to be the epicentre of a strong earthquake. The greater threat, they say, lies closer to quake-prone Himalayan region.

The succession of minor tremors originating in Delhi has led to fears of a bigger quake hitting the region. Particularly so because some studies abroad point to the possibility of low-intensity earthquakes preceding a bigger one. A study by USA’s Los Alamos National Laboratory last year had found smaller quakes were recorded days or weeks before earthquakes of at least magnitude 4.0 struck the Californian region.

Led by author Daniel Trugman, the study analysed data from south California of at least 4.0 magnitude earthquakes between 2008 and 2017, and found that some 72% of these were preceded by smaller quakes.

However, J L Gautam , head (operations) at NCS told TOI that Delhi’s quakes have been fairly minor and were not the result of a particular fault. These were minor adjustments underneath the earth’s surface, which is not alarming, he said.

Gautam said the quakes were nothing to be concerned about. “These can occur from time to time. The intensity and the scale of these quakes were not much. Delhi is not considered a high seismological risk zone and it is rare to have earthquakes with their epicentre here. A greater risk lies towards the Himalayan region,” said Gautam, pointing towards the recent Nepal earthquake as an indicator that seismic stress was building up in the region.

All four of Delhi’s earthquakes, which first began on April 12 have been of 3.5 magnitude or less, with the latest being only 2.2 on the scale.

Experts say buildings built in Delhi, especially the newer ones and adhering to zone-IV regulations can withstand earthquakes ranging from 6 to 6.6 in magnitude, while older buildings can withstand shocks ranging from 5 to 5.5.

The Bureau of Indian Standards has classified the entire country into four seismic groups – ranging from zone II (low intensity) to zone V (very severe). Delhi falls in zone IV (severe), according to this categorisation, with three fault lines running through it — the Sohna, Mathura and Delhi-Moradabad.

Even as Covid-19 cases surge across the country and quarantine centres run by state governments begin to overflow, tales of woes at these centres in many states continue to spill over.A number of cases of people fleeing quarantine centres to commit suicide has been pouring in. While a labourer in Yavatmal in Maharashtra hanged himself from a tree after fleeing a centre on Saturday, a person in Odisha’s Mayurbhanj also committed suicide on Thursday.Many are also fleeing to escape sordid conditions and lack of facilities.It has been 48 hours since Sundararaj (43) fled from Tamil Nadu’s biggest medical facility — Rajiv Gandhi Government General Hospital — and police are yet to trace him. What worries authorities is that he is part of the notorious ‘Koyambedu cluster’ which is responsible for infection of more than 2,000 people in Tamil Nadu.In Latehar in Jharkhand , over 100 migrants escaped from a quarantine centre on Friday to escape from poor facilities there. They were later brought back by the police.Several incidents of migrants fleeing quarantine centres have been reported from many districts in Bihar. On Thursday, 17 inmates of a centre in Nalanda escaped.And, while those in quarantine struggle to cope with unhygienic conditions, the stigma of being in quarantine is adding to the woes of many. A woman who has been in a centre in Pune, said: “When the hostel in charge comes to distribute food packets, he kicks the door open and throws food packets at us. We are not untouchables.”“The guards and employees at our quarantine centre push or throw food packets at us. This is inhuman. Even if we are suspects, we deserve some respect,” said a man at a quarantine centre at a private university in Rajasthan.Lack of basic amenities and cleanliness is leading to ruckus at quarantine centres. There were problems at quarantine centres in Rajasthan when people complained of mismanagement, especially unclean washroom and delayed supply of meals.Dirty toilets and insufficient quantity of food have been the most common complaints from quarantine centres in and around Mumbai, where over 12,000 people are in institutional quarantine.In Mumbai, when a Breach Candy resident put her domestic help, who tested Covid positive last week, in civic quarantine, the patient texted to say the bedsheets hadn’t been changed, the toilets were stinking and there was a menace of mosquitoes.Lack of medical care has also been the bane of many.A family that was placed in quarantine in a housing colony in Bhiwandi complained that their father, a diabetic, had been asked to bring his own medicines from home. “In the rush, we didn’t pack enough and are worried about running out of tablets. The doctor sits on the ground floor and rarely comes up for rounds,”' said one of the relatives.But, it isn’t just the government-run centres where people are suffering.

NEW DELHI: The final draft of the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020 has proposed an overarching Higher Education Promotion Commission (HEPC) with four separate verticals —regulation, accreditation, funding, and academic standard— as part of complete overhaul of the present regulatory system. At present, there are separate regulators for different sets of institutions. Technical institutions are under the AICTE, universities and colleges under the UGC , medical colleges under the Medical Council of India , etc.

Under the proposed regulatory system, distinct functions of regulation, accreditation, funding and setting academic standards will be performed by independent and empowered bodies irrespective of the branch of study.

HEPC will have four independent verticals—National Higher Education Regulatory Council (NHERC) as common, single regulator for the entire higher education sector; National Accreditation Council (NAC), a ‘meta-accrediting body’; Higher Education Grants Council (HEGC) for funding and financing of higher education; and General Education Council (GEC) to frame expected learning outcomes for higher education programmes.

These verticals will have powers for punitive action to shut down or penalise higher educational institutions (HEIs) for dishonesty in self-disclosures or for not conforming to basic minimum norms and standards.

According to an HRD official, these four verticals will subsume the present regulatory bodies as their specific roles will be redistributed. For example, UGC’s functions relating to academic standards will be subsumed under GEC, while its funding powers will go to HEGC. Similarly, National Assessment and Accreditation Council will be incorporated in NAC. The document advocates for greater autonomy to all HEIs and the responsibility will rest on its Board of Governors.

The document advocates for greater autonomy to all HEIs and the responsibility and accountability will rest on its Board of Governors. The new regulatory regime will also make setting up of new institutions easier.

Under the section ‘Transforming the Regulatory System of Higher Education’, the vision document states: “Ironically, this rigid inspectorial regime has also had a consistently poor record of weeding out poor practices and institutions... The regulatory system is thus in need of a complete overhaul in order to re-energise the higher education sector and enable it to thrive.”

In line with autonomy granted to the premier IIMs, NEP 2020 also projects similar freedom for all HEIs and has a dedicated a section on ‘effective governance and leadership for higher education institutions’, where it states that “through a suitable system of graded accreditation and graded autonomy, and in a phased manner, all higher educational institutions will aim to become independent self-governing institutions pursuing innovation and excellence”.

18,['17/05/2020'],"After HC notice, UP withdraws order extending working shifts to 12 hrs in manufacturing units","Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath (File photo)

NEW DELHI: The Uttar Pradesh government has withdrawn its order increasing daily work hour shifts from the existing 8 hours to 12 hours in manufacturing units, a day after the Allahabad High Court issued a notice to the state on a PIL which challenged the decision.

On May 15, the state government, in an order signed by Principal Secretary ( Labour ) Suresh Chandra, directed the state counsel to inform the High Court in the next hearing on May 18 that the controversial order stands withdrawn.

On May 8, the UP government had ordered increase in duration of working shifts to 12 hours by diluting certain sections of the Factories Act of 1948. The order had also said payment for additional hours of work will be “in proportion of the existing wages”, a clause that was opposed by trade unions on grounds that any overtime should be “double” the wages.

Speaking to TOI, AITUC general secretary Amarjeet Kaur said, “Ten states have increased working hours from 8 to 12 hours. UP’s hurried withdrawal after the decision was challenged in court will prompt other states to follow suit. We have also written to the International Labour Organisation in this regard, and it has said in a statement that the state government’s decision is in contravention of the ILO convention, to which India is a signatory.”

The withdrawal of the labour department’s order, however, has no bearing on the ‘Uttar Pradesh Temporary Exemption from Certain Labour Laws Ordinance, 2020’, which seeks to put all but three labour laws in the state in abeyance for three years, and increasing daily work hours to 10 hours.

In the ordinance, UP has invoked Section 5 of the Factories Act which is called in during national emergencies or war situations. Here too, UP has provisioned for payment for extra hours in proportion to existing wages, instead of double wages as has been done by states like Punjab and Rajasthan.

Other states which have diluted their labour laws to encourage economic activity in the wake of coronavirus-triggered lockdown include Maharasthra, Rajasthan, Gujarat, Goa, MP, Uttarakhand, Assam, Punjab, Haryana and Himachal Pradesh.

The ministry officials said they are capable of scaling this up to three lakh passengers. Till Thursday, 14 lakh stranded migrants had taken these trains to head home.In a series of tweets, Goyal urged district collectors to prepare lists of stranded labourers and their destinations and “apply to the railways through the state nodal officer” so that more trains can be pressed into service to transport them. ”Meanwhile, the West Bengal government has said it will bear the rail fare of migrant labourers who were returning home by special trains. In a communication to railway board chairman Vinod Kumar Yadav on Saturday, state chief secretary Rajiva Sinha said, “Instructions may be issued to officials concerned that non costs may be claimed from those boarding these trains destined for West Bengal at station of origin.”However, sources said as per the norm, the sending state will pay the ticket amount to the railways.On Friday a Twitter war had broken out between rail minister and CMs of Rajasthan, Jharkhand and Chhattisgarh after Goyal had alleged that three states and West Bengal were not giving approval for more Shramik Specials.

But at least 381 had died in 1,200 road crashes, according to data compiled based on media reports by SaveLife Foundation . This translates to a fatality rate of nearly 32%.Even during 2019, the fatality rate per 100 road crashes was around 30. “Based on the media tracking and de-duplication done by our organisation, 145 out of the 381 road deaths between March 24 and May 16 were migrants,” said Piyush Tewari of SaveLife Foundation.Road safety experts have been demanding measures including keeping one lane free from vehicles for safe passage of migrant workers who are walking back home and thorough briefing to bus drivers with regard to emergency protocols, identifying rest areas where food and water can be provided to travellers, engaging drivers well trained in long-distance driving and familiar with particular terrains.Road Safety Network, a coalition of road safety experts and organisations, has also sent recommendations to the Union home secretary suggesting the need to include temporary lanes for cyclists and pedestrians on highways and urban roads.Seeking immediate intervention from the road transport ministry, Harman Singh Sidhu of ArriveSAFE has urged Union minister Nitin Gadkari to “issue directions to keep one lane ‘vehicle free’ as soon as possible.”The road deaths during a nationwide lockdown have stumped experts and government officials as well. Speeding is being seen as the main reason behind such fatal crashes and it has once again reinforced how road users’ behaviour is responsible for a majority of crashes and fatalities in India.Taking note of the vulnerability of pedestrians on major roads and highways, the home ministry has issued advisories asking states to ensure that migrants are walking on roads to reach home.",india,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-75783238,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-389229,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/a-road-crash-is-10-times-more-likely-to-kill-than-coronavirus/articleshow/75783239.cms
21,['17/05/2020'],"Give all families, irrespective of ration cards, free food for three months, says economist Renana Jhabvala","What has this lockdown revealed about the situation of workers?

SEWA has been looking at the impact on women workers. What have you found?

What do workers need now, in terms of social assistance and security?

What do you make of recent changes in the labour laws, in terms of working conditions and bargaining power?

How are informal workers placed in this regime? What do you foresee for their immediate future?

Has an inflexible labour law really been the big obstacle for ease of doing business in India?

Renana Jhabvala, a social worker and economist, has spent over four decades organising informal women workers with the Self Employed Women’s Association (SEWA) which has 1.7 million members across 14 states. She is chairperson of SEWA Federation . She tells Amulya Gopalakrishnan her view of how the lockdown has impacted workers, and what can be done nowIt has been quite devastating. Most workers, as we know, are in the informal sector: either self-employed or working as wage workers on contract, casual or daily wages. About 80% of the non-agricultural sector is informal and, of course, most agriculture still remains informal. In the non-agricultural sectors, most work has stopped and the workers have no incoming wage or income. A study done by Chicago University in April found that over 70% of households would not be able to survive on their existing incomes and savings beyond May 2020. In a study done on SEWA members, we found that 78% are already borrowing from family, community or moneylenders. Most families have cut down on food expenditure.We found some of the following effects: Construction workers are completely unemployed. Home-based workers also have lost all work as their orders from contractors and shops have dried up, however a few have turned to making masks, with low payments; domestic workers have not visited their employers for nearly two months and many have not been paid even for month of March; and street vendors have lost their employment although some are able to continue work by selling vegetablesor fruit.One of the main things that government declared was immediate distribution of rations. However, in our study we found that 30% of the families of workers did not have ration cards. Some states have tried to distribute rations to non-ration-card holders also, but this has been patchy. Our main recommendation is that for three months, all families, irrespective of ration cards, should get free food. This should be a complete package of atta or rice, pulses, oil, sugar, tea and soap.The government has also announced direct benefit transfers of various types. About 59% of eligible women interviewed said that they have received Rs 500 in Jan Dhan accounts. It is our recommendation that all Jan Dhan accounts should receive a sum of money which would allow them to survive for at least 3 months, that is, about Rs 5,000 per month.The lockdown has revealed the vulnerable situation of the workers, namely that they have no social security net and that at times of crisis, they have neither food nor cash to tide them over, nor any governmental support.But instead of helping these vulnerable workers by providing a social security net, many state governments have announced that workers will have to now work 12 hours a day, 6 days a week. This is inhuman: how can any person work such long hours of manual labour without breaking down? Should workers’ bodies have to bear the full burden of revival?The UP government has gone further and suspended all labour laws. The intent is against the welfare of the workers. For example, suspending Minimum Wages Act means employers can pay exploitative wages to workers, while suspending the Trade Union Act means workers cannot organise or bargain even if they are being heavily penalised.I would like to highlight the plight of self-employed workers. According to NSSO, there are 6.3 crore such non-agricultural workers who have unregistered micro enterprises, mostly run by family, where they earn just enough to survive. These little businesses are all shut down and the worker has to use the capital for the family’s food and essential expenses. When the economy opens, these self-employed people will have no capital left and may have gone into debt, many of them will have to shut down leading to immense hardship. In the MSME packages announced by government, these little enterprises are not being covered.No, I don’t think so. Most workers are anyway on contracts and labour laws are avoided; even the Minimum Wages Act is not implemented in many places. In many ways, China’s workers are more protected than Indian workers. Ease of doing business can be hindered by many things, including inflexible bureaucracy and insufficient infrastructure.",home,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-75779663,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-265327,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//home/sunday-times/give-all-families-irrespective-of-ration-cards-free-food-for-three-months-says-economist-renana-jhabvala/articleshow/75779556.cms

MANDYA: The proposal to privatise MySugar Mills in Mandya district has always been a highly delicate issue, with activists and local farmers opposed to the idea of the state government giving up ownership of the facility, which has been defunct for long. Chief minister BS Yediyurappa , reportedly under pressure against giving his nod to privatising the mill, is believed to have directed senior bureaucrats in the government to explore the option of handing over operation and maintenance (O&M) to private entities, while the state retains ownership.

Among those opposed to completely privatising the mill are elected representatives from Mandya. However, the CM believes that by entrusting crushing operations and maintenance to private entities, and keeping the government’s stake in the mill intact, might be a solution acceptable to all.

Thinker and activist MB Naganna, among those who has been opposing the idea of privatising MySugar Mill in Mandya from the start, feels that the O&M formula would be the best solution to the longstanding problem.

Naganna said that, under the O&M model, the private entrepreneurs tasked with the mill’s operations would share in the profits of the facility. “The model must, however, also look to bring in transaparency in the finances involved in the mill’s maintenance,” he added.

Lapses, if any, in dealing with the co-morbidity factors should be addressed, lest it become a major health challenge,” he warned.Addressing reporters on Saturday, Khader, said only carrying out such types of analysis will help the health department combat the spread of the novel coronavirus in the future. “At present, the only data available with the health authorities here and in the state war room, is the number of people tested and number of positive cases,” Khader said.“Any strategy to combat Covid-19 must be built around scientific analysis of causes of how the disease is spreading and to do so, concrete efforts must be made to find the source of the cluster at the First Neuro Hospital in Padil.

On Sunday, the 24-year-old donor Harsh Gandhi’s stem cell will be transplanted into this little girl in a hospital in Maharashtra.

In fact, this will be the first stem cell transplant after the nationwide Covid-induced lockdown was clamped on March 23, said Jalpa Sukhanandi, regional head, DATRI, India’s largest unrelated blood stem cells donors registry.

On Saturday, Gandhi travelled all the way from Bhavnagar to Ahmedabad for the process of donating his stem cells that was done in a private hospital. The stem cells were then dispatched through a special vehicle that would travel non-stop to the Maharashtra hospital for transplant into the 14-year-old on Sunday.

“I am very happy that my few hours of travelling will save someone’s life. Though the situation is not advisable for travel, everyone is trying their bit to help the society in this difficult time. So, I to stepped out to save a life,” said a beaming Gandhi, who was accompanied by his wife to Ahmedabad on Saturday.

A staunch believer in the doctrine of Jeev Daya ((compassion towards living beings), Gandhi added that the patient’s condition is critical and the successful transplant would be the most satisfactory moment of his life.

The probability of finding blood stem cell matching donor is only 1 in 10,000 to one in over a million as the total number of voluntary donors registered are very low. There are only a little more than 4.5 lakh blood stem cell donors registered with DATRI, which is less than 0.33% of the total population of India.

Blood stem cell transplants across the country have been stalled due to the lockdown. ""There are at least 14 patients who have got matches for blood stem cell across the country, but due to restrictions on movement of vehicles and flight operations, they are stalled.”

During the stem cell donation, all the safety measures in respect of Covid-19 were followed and the DATRI team ensured safety of Gandhi and his family at every step.

“The course would offer advanced interdisciplinary education in molecular, cellular, biochemical, biophysical and pharmacological fundamentals in biology and also in bioinformatics ,” said Dr Mrinalini Nair, who is coordinator since 2015.

“The MSc biotechnology programme had initially started as one of the first five DBT supported centres in 1985 by late Dr V V Modi. It has run successfully for over the past 30 years, where over 60 % of the students clear national eligibility tests with high placement records in top national and international institutes. The programme has fostered the foundation of several bright scientists across the globe,” she said.

DBT had recently initiated an exercise to revisit and revamp all the existing PG teaching programmes. It had recommended fresh applications for approval of programmes through rigorous reselection of universities/ institutes. “The recognition and selection for a second time are due to feedback from students, high success of the programme, strong research culture with quality publications and infrastructure that had been developed through extramural funds,” said Nair.

This testing before exiting the lockdown is aimed at collecting specific data on the trends of transmission, based on real-time evidence. We will analyze the data and study the trend, based on which a post-lockdown preventive strategy will be prepared,” said a health department official.Swasthya Bhawan sources said the surveillance would throw up information, like the presence of infection, if any, among low-risk population in districts that have not reported any Covid case. While for districts that already have Covid cases, the survey report will help analyze the trend of infection on weekly basis. “Such data will help decide whether to lift the lockdown in specific districts or not. If the restrictions are eased, we have to figure out a method for it,” said the health department official.Among low-risk categories, swab samples will be tested for asymptomatic pregnant women reporting to antenatal clinics or undergoing institutional delivery and asymptomatic OPD patients as well hospitalized patients. From every district, 50 samples of pregnant women and 50 of asymptomatic OPD and admitted patients will be tested over a week. “Examining people belonging to the low-risk category is important as it serves as a marker for general community prevalence of the infection,” said the official.Healthcare wokers will fall in the high-risk category. Samples of 100 such health workers, including doctors, nurses, Group D staff, Asha workers and ANMs, will be tested in every district.A nodal officer has been assigned for each district for the purpose. Collections and testing of swab samples in many districts already started on Friday. Each district is expected to collect and test 200 samples by Sunday.

33,['17/05/2020'],AUM of equity mutual funds drop by 6.5%,"Outlook for May, June

AHMEDABAD: Radhika Shah (name changed to protect identity), a corporate professional used to make an investment of Rs 20,000 per month in a systematic investment plan. However, due to the lockdown, she faced a 20% deduction in her take-home salary. “A 20% cut in salary is not sustainable; I have loans to repay and a family to take care of. At this point, survival is more important than savings and thus I stopped the SIP deductions,” said Shah.Shrinking individual incomes due to the lockdown have severely hit the SIP inflows into equity mutual funds. This, coupled with reduction in net asset value of existing investments due to volatility in stock market indices has caused a decline in the overall assets under management (AUM) for equity-linked mutual funds. In Gujarat, the AUM fell from Rs 69 ,994.2 crore in March 2020 to Rs 65,418.3 crore in April 2020 – a decline of 6.54%. The AUM for equity-linked mutual funds investments (MFIs) continued to fall for the second consecutive month, witnessing an erosion of Rs 4 ,575.5 crore.“Fall in people’s income is one of the clear reasons for a decline in SIP investments and that has led to stoppage of several SIPs. That apart, the volatility of the Indian equity markets also caused the net asset value of existing investments to fall, which also dented the overall AUM in equity-linked MFs,” said Jayesh Vithalani, a city-based financial analyst.Analysts also said given the situation, that most schemes have introduced a pause option i.e. the periodic deductions would be temporarily halted and resumed when the investor is comfortable with one’s source of income.“This option is indeed a relief to retail investors whose incomes have been temporarily impacted owing to the lockdown and has been widely utilised. The trend of stopping SIPs grew stronger in the second half of April, by when people took salary cuts or business incomes got hampered. Therefore, decline in SIP inflow may also be visible more strongly in May and June as well,” said Mumukshu Desai, director of a city-based financial advisory firm.According to industry experts, while most investors have sought pausing or stoppage of SIP deductions, people have not withdrawn funds. “Investors are behaving smartly. They have not withdrawn funds at a point when the market is down thus converting their notional loss into an actual one; unless a given investor is in dire need for liquidity,” said Desai.Apart from equity-linked MFs, overall AUM in Gujarat too continued its downward trend. The total AUM witnessed an erosion of Rs 14,040 crore, falling further by 8.1% from Rs 1.72 lakh crore in March to Rs 1.58 lakh crore in April.Analysts attribute this decline to the major erosion seen in debt-linked MFs and liquid schemes. The reduction of AUM in debt-linked schemes can be attributed to the withdrawal of six schemes by Franklin Templeton and the subsequent embargo on withdrawals.· If incomes continue to shrink, retail investors will continue to stop SIP deductions and the inflows for May and June are expected to get affected.· The situation in the equity markets is expected to gradually improve over the next few weeks. The stimulus measures announced by the Union finance minister have had little impact on the stock market indices as the relief was centred around MSMEs and agricultureAt the same time, analysts are closely watching whether corporates who primarily invest in debt funds, withdraw funds and put them into low-risk avenues like bank deposits, given the uncertainty and concerns triggered by Franklin Templeton’s announcement of withdrawal of six schemes last month.",ahmedabad,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-75787070,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-672545,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/aum-of-equity-mutual-funds-drop-by-6-5/articleshow/75782090.cms

AHMEDABAD: Gujarat high court has permitted a 19-year-old rape survivor to undergo medical termination of 24-week pregnancy after the later requested for the same arguing that the continuation of pregnancy may affect her physical and mental health.

The rape survivor belongs to Navsari district in south Gujarat. She approached the HC for directions to the medical authority to abort her fetus complaining that since it is a medico-legal case , the doctors turned down her request for abortion in absence of HC order.

It was submitted that the pregnancy was of 24 weeks, therefore, medical practitioners cannot on their own terminate the pregnancy. If they terminate the pregnancy without the order of the court, the act of the doctor amounts to an offence punishable under the Indian Penal Code or under the Medical Termination of Pregnancy Act, which prohibits abortion beyond 20 weeks of pregnancy.

After getting medical opinion, Justice V H Patel permitted the rape victim to terminate her pregnancy at the earliest. The court ordered concerned doctors at the hospital in Surat to follow the procedure and report the court in a week’s time.

According to additional public prosecutor Himanshu Patel, the HC has ordered the medical superintendent of New Civil Hospital, Surat, to hand over, in scientific manner, the tissues drawn from the fetus for DNA identification to the investigating officer in the rape case as registered in Vejalpore police station.

37,['17/05/2020'],Bihar: Cop-turned-poet wows all with piece on Covid-19,"PATNA: On the field he is considered a tough task master. Off duty, he is a literary writer.Meet Rajesh Kumar, a 2003 batch IPS officer , whose poem on Covid-19 pandemic is doing the rounds on social media these days. Posted as DIG of Begusarai range, Kumar turned so emotional after going through the sufferings of people that he penned a poem recently.The lyrics of the poem goes like this, ‘Corona bhi na jane kya karne laga hai, aadmi ab aadmi se darne laga hai. Shahar hain viran se, gaon hain sunsan se, har taraf na jane kyun marghaton sa maun hai, jeevan kitna bemani sa lagne laga hai, aadmi ab aadmi se darne laga hai’.Kumar got inspiration to pen his poem during the first phase of lockdown announced by PM Narendra Modi on March 24. “Since Begusarai figured on the list of Covid-19 affected districts in the initial days of the pandemic, I had to visit places where people were kept in quarantine. I came across several such people whose lives became a source of inspiration for me as a writer,” he said.The poem also deals with significant changes in the nature during the lockdown. Describing the changes, the poet says, “Par panchhiyon ki kalrav kyo sunne lagi hai, hawa kyon mastani si dikhne lagi hai, nadiyan ab kuchh khulke kyon bahne lagi hai, kuchh achha bhi anjaane hi hone laga hai, kyon aadmi se aadmi darne laga hai.”Through his poem, Kumar has also tried to create awareness among people about the far-reaching consequences of the pandemic. Referring to the dangers posed to the humanity by the deadly virus, the poet says, “Wajood ab khatre mein hai aaj hamara, jeevan ko bachana hi hai uddeshya hamara, ab saath milkar aao corona ko hara den.”The poet says the people have to maintain social distancing and self-discipline to defeat the virus.A native of Haryana, Kumar has a penchant for writing poems since childhood. “I have been reading and writing poems since my childhood,” he said.This is not the first time that 1976-born IPS officer has composed a poem. Last year, CM Nitish Kumar had released his collection of 62 poems titled ‘Jee Le Zara’.",patna,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-75786417,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-75622,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/cop-turned-poet-wows-all-with-piece-on-covid-19/articleshow/75781508.cms

SURAT: A 31-year-old cardiologist has alleged of being harassed by police at a check post, which the police are denying.

In his written complaint with Katargam police, Dr Bhavesh Talavia has said that cops even tore his shirt during the argument. Police, however, claim that the doctor first entered in a lane meant for two-wheelers and when asked to switch to the correct lane, he drove his car at high speed.

While Dr Talavia wants strict action on the errant cops, he did not register a police complaint but requested departmental actions only.

According to the case details, Talavia was going in his car with his assistant to Amroli from Katargam area when he was asked to stop before the bridge at a check point by the police. “The cop had raised his hand signalling me to stop and when I reached close to him and applied breaks, the car inched forward. This annoyed him and started abusing me,” Talavia alleged, adding that more cops joined in the argument.

“As I came out from car they started threatening me of arrest and taking me to police station. I requested them to take me to the police station during which, they even tore my shirt,” he added.

B N Dave, assistant commissioner of police, traffic, however, clarified that police have separated lanes for two wheelers and four wheelers at Amroli bridge to manage traffic better. “The doctor was trying to enter in the wrong lane and was asked to switch to proper lane. He went to the four wheeler lane and then drove at high speed when police stopped him,” said Dave, adding that he started arguing with police when he was stopped again for speeding in the narrow lane.

SURAT: Compared to adult Covid-19 positive patients , children below the age of 12 years have shown faster recovery rate of 92% in the city.

When Covid-19 hospital built on New Civil Hospital (NCH) campus is overflowing with adult patients, positive news has trickled in from its paediatric ward. Out of the total 40 Covid-19 positive children, 35, including a three-month-old girl, one of the youngest patient in Surat, defeated the deadly virus and were discharged in the last one month. Hospital authorities said condition of five remaining Covid-19 positive children is stable and that they too will be discharged soon. Out of the 40 children, 17 were girls and 23 boys and their age ranged from three months to 12 years.

Dr Panna Bulsara, nodal officer of Covid-19 paediatric ward, told TOI, “Most of the children were asymptomatic and had tested positive during community sampling drive. The winning spirits of the children, dedication of the health staff and doctors at the NCH were responsible for the recovery of the children.”

The children were provided with healthy and nutritious meal, medicines including antibiotics and vitamin supplements. A positive environment also helped them to fight back, he said.

“Our nursing staff and doctors used to play with the children to remove the fear of disease from their minds. Mothers of many small children were staying with their kids in the ward,” said Dr Bulsara.

Two cousin brothers-four-year-old Jeet Rana and five-year-old Vadik Rana- residents of Maan Darwaja tenements defeated the deadly virus within seven days. They were admitted in the paediatric ward on April 20 and got discharged from the hospital on April 27.

Dr Vijay Shah, head of the paediatric department at NCH, said, “It is very difficult to manage children with Covid-19 and keep them in the ward for days together. We had to attend to each one of them personally. Our team of nurses and doctors took utmost care of the children, which resulted in their faster recovery. From time to time, the children and their parents were counselled that the virus can be defeated. ”

KOLKATA: Unrestricted kite flying in the Park Circus-Tiljala area ever since the beginning of the lockdown — especially on the approach to Maa flyover at both ends —claimed a life on Saturday evening.

Akhtar Khan, a 40-year-old resident of Kabitirtha in Kidderpore , died after the Chinese thread of a flying kite got tangled around his neck and knocked him off his bike. The incident was reported on the AJC Bose Road flyover-Maa flyover connector at 5.15pm. He was taken to CNMC Hospital where doctors declared him dead.

Though similar accidents have been reported on the twin flyovers for the past three years — leading to about 25-odd accidents, some of them serious — this is the first fatal accident of its kind. The incident was also the first recorded fatality in the Kolkata Police area since April 3, thus ending the accident-free run of Kolkata Police during the lockdown.

Police sources said the man was riding at a speed a little higher than allowed when the thread caught his neck at a crucial bend. A case in this regard has been initiated at the Beniapukur police station.

KMDA had planned several measures to tackle the kite-thread menace at this spot but could not implement them. Earlier, three back-to-back accidents took place between April 1 and April 5 on the Maa flyover stretch here, where two of the victims happened to be a special branch cop and a banker. The cops launched a drive to control such accidents. Saturday’s incident shows the relief was a short one.

According to the study on ambient air quality conducted by the Gujarat Pollution Control Board (GPCB), the PM10 and PM2.5 concentrations in Vapi and Anleshwar reduced by 40% and 34% respectively, making the air breathable for the residents. Also, the Air Quality Index (AQI) has improved from 160 (moderate) to 79 (satisfactory) in Ankleshwar, whereas in Vapi it improved from 177 to 102.

The GPCB carried out the study to find and evaluate the average value of air quality parametres data generated Continuous Ambient Air Quality Monitority Systems (CAAQMS) stations located at Vapi and Ankleshwar for the pre-lockdown period—March 15 to March 21—and national lockdown period—March 22 to March 28.

In Ankleshwar GIDC area, few essential services based industries were operational, while other industries were completely shut. Moreover, there was negligible movement of vehicles including commercial and private, which resulted in the improvement of air quality.

In Vapi, the findings revealed reduction of 40.4% in PM10 and 34.9% in PM2.5.

About 950 units were in operation during pre-lockdown period and once the national lockdown was imposed, about 46 industrial units comprising of pharmaceuticals, pesticides and disinfectants and sanitiser manufacturing units were in operation.

GPCB study stated that the drop in average concentration values of coarse and fine particulate matter is due to the restriction on construction activities, less road re-suspension and curb on industrial combustion activities.

“The reductions in values of ambient air quality parametres can thus be attributed to the complete restrictions on non-essential vehicular movement and commercial activities, the emissions from construction activities and industrial activities,” said the report.

“The long term benefits of the air pollution reduction depends on whether the impacts are sustained or there are chances of reversal once the Covid-19 challenge ends,” added the report.

However, when the final count of passengers to alight at the station came to just 282, they knew nothing could go wrong.

South Goa collector Ajit Roy, who personally monitored the activities at the Margao railway station, said that arrival of a fraction of the expected number of passengers had eased the situation quite a bit. “Yes, some relief,” Roy said, when questioned.

He attributed the lesser quantum to probable last-minute cancellation by some passengers for whatever reasons. “Everybody might not have boarded the train. This is the only stop in Goa, and 282 people have come to Goa by this train,” Roy said.

All the 282 passengers were taken to South Goa district hospital for the Covid-19 test. A swab collection facility and testing centre has been set up at the hospital. After their swabs were collected, the passengers were ferried by Kadamba buses to the Jawaharlal Nehru stadium, Fatorda, where they were quarantined until their test reports were out.

Some anxious moments were witnessed at the railway station after a few passengers refused to pay for their Covid-19 tests. A sum of Rs 2,000 was collected from all passengers, including Goans, before they exited the station.

Manohar Bicholkar Teli, a resident of Bicholim, said he had no money to pay for the test, and dared the authorities to refuse him entry into the state. “I have no money on me. I have no one here from whom I can borrow money. How can they refuse me entry?” he said. A seven-member Chodankar family from Verem, also expressed their indignation on being asked to pay up for the tests, claiming they had no money left.

Earlier, 33 passengers alighted at Margao by the Thiruvanantpuram-Delhi train. All 33 were sent to the new district hospital for the test, and quarantined at the Fatorda stadium until their results were obtained.

Sources said that most of them who arrived by both the trains were either Goans or those employed in Goa.

Though adequate arrangements were put in place for swab collection of the passengers at the South Goa district hospital, many were seen protesting against the delay in completing the process.

As many of the passengers are residents of far-off places, sources said, they will have to stay overnight in the quarantine facility.

54,['17/05/2020'],Kolkata: Private hospitals counsel nurses to stay back,"KOLKATA: Nurses planning to return to their home states are being counselled to stay back by private hospitals in Kolkata who are faced with the threat of a severe service disruption in the middle of the pandemic. With more than 500 nurses having returned to Manipur, Odisha and Tripura , and more slated to follow, hospitals that are attempting to scale up operations in a bid to return to normalcy have hit a roadblock. Hospital authorities point out that in-patient services and surgeries will again have to be rolled back if more nurses quit.AMRI Hospitals, which lost 80 nurses this week, claims to have counselled 50 others into staying back. “We are addressing their concerns and they have agreed to stay back. We will continue talking to the rest and are also bringing back those who have just retired,” said CEO Rupak Barua . He added that an online recruitment process will soon be started to replace those who have quit. AMRI has around 140 nurses from the northeastern states.Medica Superspecialty Hospital, that saw an exodus of 75 nurses, has been counselling the rest. “We have transferred 75 nurses to Kolkata from our Jamshedpur unit,” said chairman Alok Roy.Contrary to reports in some sections of the media, the Manipur government had no role in calling back nurses from Kolkata. It was the nurses’ personal decision and the government had only arranged transportation for the stranded state residents in Kolkata.Woodlands Hospital has started counselling its nurses from Kerala, Odisha and Tripura. The counselling will be done one-on-one in three stages, according to CEO Rupali Basu, who pointed out that services could collapse if the exodus continues. “We are on the way to resuming normal services after a month-and-a-half-long break and this threatens to turn the clock back. We have already lost two nurses from Tripura. While everyone has the right to work where he or she wants, this is not the right time to poach healthcare workers. So we hope that state governments will take up the issue even as we persuade our nurses to stay back,” said Basu. Half of Woodlands’ 400 nurses are from other states.Nine nurses from Manipur have resigned at RN Tagore International Institute of Cardiac Sciences (RTIICS).“They have not yet left and we are counselling them to continue to stay and work here. We have just started elective cases and once those numbers go up, we will feel the strain on the system due to the shortage of nurses. So we will need to look for replacements,” said RTIICS zonal director R Venkatesh.“We are concerned that this will set a precedent for other states. We will be facing a major shortage of nurses and will not be able to offer regular services nor face the pandemic effectively,” added Venkatesh.Charnock Hospital, which had to shut down last month after several doctors and nurses tested positive, has started discussions with nurses.“We have just resumed our services and are about to scale up operations through elective surgeries and outpatient services. If nurses continue to leave at this juncture, things will go back to square one. More importantly, Covid patients will be affected since normal services are key to ensuring they receive good care,” said managing director Prashant Sharma Nurses, on the other hand, said absence of proper safety protocol, parental pressure and food issues had prompted them to go home. They said that since they did not have ration cards, many had to go without food on certain occasions. MIK (Manipuris in Kolkata), a closely-knit group of people from Manipur working in diverse professions, is trying to assess the exact reasons for the nurses’ exodus while counselling the rest not to leave Kolkata unless necessary.",kolkata,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-75784641,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-97198,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/pvt-hosps-counsel-nurses-to-stay-back/articleshow/75782420.cms

A resident of Park Circus, the infant was only 55 days old when he was admitted with his mother who had also tested positive for the disease. Both mother and baby were kept at a secluded isolation room and a core team of doctors, including paediatricians, pulmonologists and chest physicians, was formed to take care of them.The efforts bore fruit as the baby recovered within 10 days and his mother followed soon after. “The baby had undergone the then-mandatory consecutive double-negative test and was rendered free of the infection. But since the mother was still under treatment he could not be released. The two were released together last week and are doing well,” said a senior official of the hospital.Doctor Sisir Naskar , superintendent of MR Bangur Hospital — the state’s largest Covid hospital — told TOI that the case was a challenge for the attending doctors. “Since the boy was very young — the youngest patient we had handled till now — the situation was extremely challenging and we needed to take extreme precautionary measures. Because of his tender age, he could not even be kept in isolation away from his mother, who was also undergoing treatment. But we are happy that both recovered in quick time,” said Naskar.Doctors said the best thing about the child was that he had a very mild infection and was mostly asymptomatic. “His speedy recovery has boosted our morale and we are now more confident about dealing with critical patients,” said Naskar.On May 4, the state’s oldest novel coronavirus survivor, 88-year-old Sarojini Mukherjee , had recovered after being treated at the hospital for two weeks.

MANGALURU: With 20 passengers who came on the Vande Baharat Mission Air India Express repatriation flight from Dubai testing positive for Covid-19 and other issues faced at the time of their arrival, the Dakshina Kannada district administration has been forced to make changes at the airport.

According to sources, the district administration came under fire after many repatriates, especially pregnant women, alleged several discrepancies and ill-treatment, after landing at the Mangaluru International Airport on the night of May 12. The second repatriation flight to Mangaluru from Dubai will land on Monday. “The district administration has made several changes before the second repatriation flight lands here. One of the major changes is that details about hotels and their fares, where repatriates can get quarantined, will be made available at the Dubai Airport itself, so that evacuees have enough time to decide where they want to stay,” added a source, who is a government official.

When STOI contacted Rahul Shinde, probationary IAS officer, who is in charge of the quarantine facilities for the repatriates, he said that several changes have been made. “The changes are not due to what happened earlier, or several repatriates testing positive for Covid-19, but for everything to happen smoothly at the airport, when repatriation flights land,” he stressed.

He said that porters have been deputed at the Mangaluru International Airport. Secondly, more counters for hotel bookings for institutional quarantine have been arranged. A list of hotels and their fares will be made available for repatriates at the Dubai Airport itself. “This will allow repatriates ample time to decide their preferable accommodation, before they land at Mangaluru. It will also minimise confusion,” he said, and added that all the passengers must sign an undertaking for institutional quarantine before boarding their flight. However, for those cannot afford to pay for quarantine, the district administration has arranged free stay for them at hostels of government educational institutions, he said.

It can be recalled that during the first repatriation flight, which had brought about 38 pregnant women and ailing passengers to Mangaluru, it had been alleged that they had been mistreated, and made to stand for several hours without food and water. Sources added that the second repatriation flight that will land at MIA will also have several pregnant women on board.

59,['17/05/2020'],Bihar: Local industries gear up to explore global market,"Representative image

PATNA: With the Centre announcing Rs20 lakh crore economic package under the Atmanirbhar Bharat Abhiyan and Union finance minister announcing makhana cluster in Bihar on Friday, industrial units in state are gearing up to grab the opportunity to survive and thrive amid global crisis owing to Covid-19 pandemic. The industries are also looking forward to utilise thousands of migrant workers returning home during the lockdown. Archi Rani & Faryal Rumi take a look into the business plans of state industries, which will try to get the maximum of PM’s “vocal for local” call:

Makhana industry : Deputy CM Sushil Kumar Modi said Bihar produces at least 80% of the makhana (fox nuts) in the world. Satyajit Singh, a leading makhana exporter in Bihar, said CM Nitish Kumar and PM Narendra Modi identified makhana as a global health food in 2005 and 2019 respectively. “Now that the FM has announced its promotion from Bihar on the global level, we are looking forward to the state government for the crop’s promotion,” he said.

Cottage industry : Bihar Mahila Udyog Sangh president Usha Jha said local entrepreneurs were being encouraged to prepare edible items like pickle, papad, sattu, atta (flour), spices and even herbal products made of tulsi, neem and haldi. “People don’t go for local items mainly because of its packaging. We have now trained around 200 families in packaging of food items,” she said. Manju Devi and Neelam Singh, who prepare papad with their brand names, have huge orders to prepare the item for marketing. Sanoj Kumar and his family were busy making herbal products. “We are preparing soaps, handwash, derma cream and shampoo by using neem, tulsi and haldi,” he said.

Handicraft & handloom : Upendra Maharathi Shilp Anusansadhan Sansthan (UMSAS) director Ashok Kumar said around 400 artists registered with the association make Madhubani painting, tikuli art, paper-mache, block printing, appliqué work and jewellery on consignment basis. “They work on getting 50% advance for the consignment. All our artisans are working hard for living,” he said. Pramod Kumar, minister of art, culture and youth affairs, said the state government will give a platform to handicraft artists to sell their products. “In Madhubani, we are training 100 artists in different art works,” he said.

Hygiene products : With the rising demand of self-hygiene products, several industrial units are planning to manufacture masks, gloves, PPE kits, handwash and sanitizers. While some of them have already set up manufacturing units, others are training their workers to start production. Devesh Kumar, manager (non-farm and micro enterprise), JEEVIKA, said JEEVIKA didis had a business of over 27 lakh masks. “We have decided to extend it from 20 to all the 38 districts in Bihar. Besides, the didis are being trained to make medicated masks and alcohol-based sanitizers,” he said.

Cotton gamcha (towel) : Jeet Lal Prasad, owner of a Gaya firm that produces gamcha, said the product’s demand has increased after the government identified it as an alternative for face masks. “We recently delivered the product to several other states. We are also hopeful of extending the business globally in the near future,” he said.

Mushroom cultivation : Rahul Ranjan, who has a farm of oyster mushrooms in Madhubani, is planning to extend his business. “The current situation has increased the demand of mushrooms. In fact, I have been receiving at least two-three calls per day from people who wish to start mushroom cultivation,” he said.

Honey business : Bihar is second in honey production and first in its productivity. There are 9,000 bee farmers in the state. With the provision of Rs500 crore for bee farming announced by the Centre, the farmers dealing in this produce in Samastipur, Muzaffarpur and other districts will be benefited, says deputy CM Sushil Kumar Modi. State agriculture minister Prem Kumar also said, “The state government will promote the farmers for honey cultivation.” Anuj Kumar from Vaishali said, “We are now changing the packaging of honey boxes to make it more enticing. Earlier, we used to import boxes from Kolkata. Now, we are making at local level.”

Floriculture : With temples closed owing to the lockdown, the flower business in the state has suffered huge losses. Now, the flower producers are hopeful of getting some support from the Centre’s package. Ved Prakash, a nursery owner in Rajendra Nagar , said: “I have planned a few things like starting online business and increase the market,” he said. Agriculture, animal & fisheries resources minister Prem Kumar held videoconferencing on Saturday to discuss the losses the floriculture sector has suffered due to the lockdown.

Tea estate : Manish Daftari, director of a tea estate in Kishanganj, said tea manufacturers in the district are working on export quality production in order to increase its demand. “With the government’s initiatives, we are also looking forward to the export market. Besides, we are planning to start a green tea factory, which will provide employment opportunities to local workers,” he said.

VARANASI: A huge crowd of over 25,000 migrant labourers seeking entry in Bihar at Naubatpur border in Chandauli district crammed both the lanes of national highway-2 with queues of vehicles stretching to 15 km.

Even goods carriers ferrying essential supplies were stranded following which divisional commissioner Deepak Agrawal and IG Varanasi range VS Mina reached Naubatpur and talked to their counterparts from Bihar.

Migrant labourers travelling on foot, trucks and other vehicles from Maharashtra, Gujarat and Delhi have been reaching Naubatpur via UP in thousands per day since a fortnight. The migrants are being allowed entry only after proper health screening by Bihar officials at a camp in trans-Karmnasha area.

The rush of migrants increased on Saturday and over 25,000 amassed at the border. Initially, due to their movement only the lane of vehicles heading to Bihar was choked. But, since Saturday morning, the opposite lane of highway was also blocked with queues of vehicles stretching to over 15 km.

Divisional commissioner Deepak Agrawal said, “We met district magistrate Kaimur and senior police officers from Bihar and asked them to shift the checking and screening camp few km inside their territory so that the highway jam is cleared and essential supplies are not hit. They agreed to shift their screening camp. The highway opened by late afternoon.”

The officials worked to solve this problem on immediate basis as the vehicles carrying essential goods and building material were stuck in jam.

Officials said that checking of overloading by vehicles is also done at Naubatpur and is necessary since it is damaging the bridge on river Karmnasha.

HUBBALLI: Even as the country readies to ease restrictions on movement further in Lockdown 4.0 and Karnataka looks to open up most of the state, the northern districts are grappling with a surge in Covid-19 infections, especially following the return of residents from other states. The 11 districts of North Karnataka account for 50% of the cases — 533 of 1,092 — reported as of Saturday, and authorities fear the curve is showing no sign of flattening anytime soon.Of the total number of cases reported from across the region, 250 have been reported in May, when the central and state governments relaxed curbs and allowed movement of goods and people. Belagavi, Davanagere, Kalaburagi, Bidar, Bagalkot and Vijayapura have borne the brunt of the spike in Covid-19 cases in the region. Davanagere, in fact, was classified a green-zone district at the beginning of the month. A fortnight later, it has hurtled into the red zone.The number of infected has also been steadily rising in Dharwad, Haveri, Yadgir and Gadag districts, which had very few or no cases till last week. Among the districts in North Karnataka, Belagavi is the worst-hit by coronavirus, with 114 cases. It is followed by Kalaburagi, with 94 cases, and Davanagere with 89. The good news, however, is that nearly 40% of the patients (205) have been treated successfully and discharged.Senior bureaucrats in the region attributed the spurt to the easing of the lockdown, and influx of residents who were stuck in other states. Most of the people who have tested positive in the region had travelled to Ahmedabad, Mumbai or Ajmer. The other common factor, official said, was that the returnees were asymptomatic on arrival in their home districts; tests confirmed that they were infected.In Belagavi, a majority of the patients are linked to the Tablighi Jamaat congreation in Delhi — either attendees or their contacts. In Davanagere, a nurse at a primary health centre and a 69-year-old man, who subsequently succumbed to the infection, accounted for most infections among contacts.Davanagere deputy commissioner Mahantesh Bilagi said the district administration has stepped up measures to contain the infection. “As many as eight localities in Davanagere city have been completely sealed, and declared containment zones. All people entering the district are being subjected to tests and are being quarantined in accordance with the norms,” Bilagi said.- (",hubballi,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-75783303,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-68760,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hubballi/with-533-cases-n-ktaka-accounts-for-50-of-states-covid-tally/articleshow/75781769.cms

VARANASI: As the probe team looking into the May 7 Kashi Vishwanath temple’s Shaptarshi Aarti row has submitted its report to the district authorities, the temple administration has allowed eight priests of different states to enter the temple for performing rituals as per tradition.

However, the entry of temple’s former mahant and his family members to perform the rituals of Shaptarshi Aarti has not been allowed as they did not reply to the notices issued to them, KVT chief executive officer Vishal Singh said on Saturday.

Talking to TOI on Saturday, district magistrate Kaushal Raj Sharma said, “The ADM City and SP Security, who had been assigned the task to probe into the May 7 incident of performing of Shaptarshi Aarti on road near at gate-4 of temple, have submitted their report to me on Friday evening. This report has been forwarded to the principal secretary (religious affairs), divisional commissioner, temple administration and also temple truck to initiate further action with the finding of investigation and recommendations.”

The DM said that during the investigation it was found that some photographs, which were taken when the house of former mahant was getting vacated in March, were issued by terming as current photographs to prove that portions of a temple inside KV corridor are had been damaged.

“The investigators found that these photographs were released with ill intention to instigate religious sentiment of people at a time of lockdown enforce in view of Covid-19 epidemic,” he said adding, as it seems to be conspiracy, recommendation had been made by investigators to initiate action against a member of former mahant family who led the entire episode.

“The livelihood of former mahant family depends on temple, but instead of performing their responsibility at a time of lockdown this act was like disloyalty for temple and breach of trust,” said the DM on the basis of the recommendation for appropriate action made against the member of former mahant family responsible for it made in the investigation report.

He said that course of action in this regard would be decided by the religious affairs department, divisional commissioner, temple administration and trust. He said that as a case had already been lodged against the persons performed rituals on road by violating lockdown had already been taken by administration further action against them was left on temple administration.

Regarding action against the priests who took part in the rituals performed on road on May 7, the temple’s CEO said that eight priests from different states had given their reply to temple administration against the notices issued to them for their act.

He said that satisfied with their reply, the temple administration had allowed them to perform rituals in temple like past. But, he said, former mahant and his family did not give any reply against notices given to them hence no decision to allow their entry in temple to perform rituals of Shaptarshi Aarti had been taken.

On May 7 evening an awkward situation was created in and around the KVT when two parallel Shaptarshi aartis of Lord Vishwanath performed in evening on daily basis, took place. While a group of priests belonging to family and group of former mahant of temple performed the aarti on road near gate-4 another aarti was performed inside temple’s sanctum sanctorum by the priests arranged by the temple administration.

Having paid almost double the airfare, some say they expected better social distancing norms.While grateful for having reached India, Vinod Sundarraj, who arrived in the city on Monday from the US, said he paid Rs 1 lakh to get to India. “I initially thought they are charging double because the flight was coming empty from India and there would be social distancing. But it was a disappointment to see the flight was completely packed and had carried passengers from India to the US, so it was not empty both ways.” Average fare from the US to India would be in the range of Rs 50,000 to Rs 60,000 one way in the pre-lockdown era.Sundarraj, who is among 10 people from Tamil Nadu who flew into the city and will be quarantined here, is waiting to head to his state. “We are looking for clarity as to how we will travel home after quarantine ends. I am waiting to see my daughter, who was born on April 17 in Coimbatore,” he added.Bothered by the fare, Srinivas (name changed) also arrived in Hyderabad on Monday. “Everyone feels that if we can pay to travel abroad, we are privileged and can pay the higher fares. But we have put in our savings to meet family in the US. The quarantine cost —though not high — is an added burden.”He said that while protocol was followed, sitting on a long flight in proximity to others, was concerning.Travelling from Kuala Lumpur to the city, which landed on Thursday night, was Jashuva V, who paid Rs 19,085, also said there was no social distancing. “Initially, we thought they would be charging us close to Rs 35,000, but the final fare wasn’t that high. I suppose that is why they could not maintain social distance.” But happy overall, he said, “The airline staff provided us kits with masks, sanitisers and gloves. The flight was packed, but people were asked to board and settle down in groups of five-six.” The average fare from Kuala Lumpur to Hyderabad, depending on the airline, could vary from Rs 8,000-Rs 15,000 one way.Air India sources said they had followed the protocol set by government regarding social distancing norm and this was not a call the airline was taking. They added that running half empty flights was not a viable option. About the fare, the sources said a single standard fare had been collected as per the government’s decision.",hyderabad,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-75783354,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-194145,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/vande-bharat-flights-hit-social-distancing-air-pocket/articleshow/75782422.cms

HYDERABAD: Scientists at Hyderabad Research Centre Imarat ( RCI ), a Defence Research and Development Organisation lab, have stepped forward to donate groceries to senior citizens residing in five old age homes during the lockdown. Dry goods, including rice, atta, red gram, green gram, black gram and edible oil, are being supplied.

“It has become very difficult for old age homes to procure groceries during the lockdown. We collect goods from donors and deliver them to these homes in Bandlaguda, Karmanghat, Badangpet and adjoining areas of RCI, through our ‘ Defence Security Corps ’ (DSC) of the RCI-DRDO for the past few weeks. Few scientists also donated cash to purchase the material,” defence sources in DSC told TOI.

The material was procured after collating the data of number of people residing in these homes. The scientists found that around 60 to 90 senior citizens are staying in each old age home. QRT trucks were then used to transport goods to the doorsteps of these old age homes.

“We thank the RCI scientists for their goodwill as it had become really difficult for us in these situations to continue providing food to the elderly for breakfast, lunch and dinner,” said Srinivas Rao, an organiser at the Arshita Old Age home in Badangpet.

G Giri, who runs the Mathru Devobhava Ashramam said, “I thanks the blessings that have come out way. The scientists and their families came to our rescue when we least expected it.”

The prolonged lockdown and strict movement restriction had led to a shortage of various essentials for these homes. People had also been struggling to get vital medicines. Certain good samaritans from the city had come forward in situations like these to help the elderly in need.

AHMEDABAD: It seems the wait for the announcement of the new vice-chancellor for Gujarat University has just got a bit longer. With the three-year term of Himanshu Pandya as vice-chancellor coming to an end on May 16, he has stepped down from the post with the charge being temporarily given to Jagdish Bhavsar, pro VC of GU, said sources close to the development.

Bhavsar will hold the position of in-charge VC till a full-time candidate is finalized for the post, sources said.

The reason cited for this delay is that the search committee formed three months ago to shortlist names for the post of VC, could not complete the task due to the Covid-19 pandemic and the lockdown situation, sources said.

“The committee could only hold a couple of meetings and that too online in the past three months due to the ongoing nationwide lockdown,” said a GU official in the know of the matter.

Bhavsar took over the charge from Pandya on Saturday, he added. Earlier a professor in the science department, Pandya took charge of the post on May 16, 2017. Pandya, who himself remains one of the contenders for the post, is hopeful of getting a second term.

Once believed to be close to the Bharatiya Janata Party in Gujarat, his candidature is currently opposed by members of BJP-backed Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP) after they faced a crushing defeat from Congress’s student wing National Students’ Union of India in GU students’ union elections held earlier this year, sources said.

The three-member search committee formed for choosing the new VC for GU is headed by Gujarat governor Acharya Devvrat. It includes Kamlesh Joshipura, former vice-chancellor of Saurashtra University whose name was chosen by GU. Parimal Vyas has been chosen by the Joint Board of Vice-Chancellors (JBVC) is the third member of the committee.

VIJAYAWADA: The decision of the Andhra Pradesh State Road Transport Corporation ( APSRTC ) to utilise the services of regular employees in place of outsourced workers has sparked a row.

While worker unions and opposition parties have alleged that the RTC is trying to lay off more than 7,000 outsourced employees, the state government has said it is only a temporary arrangement as bus services are yet to be restored and outsourced employees will be taken back once normalcy is restored.

The APSRTC had issued an office order stating that services of regular employees would be utilised in places where outsourced employees were in service. The decision will affect more than 7,600 outsourced employees, workers unions have alleged.

General secretary of the employees union (EU) Palisetti Damodar has urged the management and transport minister Perni Venkatramaiah to roll back the decision. Damodar said that while the Union government has directed to not lay off employees during the lockdown, the management of APSRTC is trying to remove outsourced employees who are already suffering due to non-payment of salaries.

State secretary of Communist Party of India K Ramakrishna criticised the government over the decision and demanded all outsourced employees be taken aborad and their salaries cleared.

Transport minister Perni Venkatramaiah said the government is not laying off any employee. APSRTC management has decided to utilise the services of regular employees as bus services are yet to be restored, the minister said. “It is only a temporary arrangement till things get to normal and all outsourced employees will be taken back once the corporation is fully operational,” the minister said.

Meanwhile, APSRTC has deducted one day’s salary of five employees in West Godavari district for a protest demanding wages to outsourced employees be cleared, insurance for RTC workers, personal protection equipment for workers on duty and to not allot duties to RTC staff at liquor stores. In its order, the RTC stated that the action of the employees who sat on dharna amounted to gross indiscipline. Workers unions have protested the move to deduct salary.

On an average more than 1,000 laboureres are passing through the district to reach their home towns in Odisha, Chhattisgarh, Bihar, Jharkhand and West Bengal.Speaking to a few of them, it was found out that lack of information on train schedules and fear of being quarantined are two of the main reasons why many of them are choosing to walk than take the trains.“More than 10,000 migrant workers passed through Visakhapatnam in the last 10 days either on foot or bicycles. We have seen many youth crossing the check post at the cricket stadium,” said one of the police constables. So far the district administration has arranged three special trains for migrant labourers, more trains would leave from the city in a few days.“I had Rs 10,000 when the lockdown began.

SECUNDERABAD: The fund-starved Secunderabad Cantonment Board ( SCB ) is staring at a Rs 2 crore water bill, even as the prolonged lockdown has slowed down all economic activity for the past seven weeks.

The SCB has to pay Rs 2 crore per month to Hyderabad Metropolitan Water Supply Board and Sewerage Board (HMWS&SB) towards the supply of potable water. Water board is supplying 60 lakh gallons of water per day (LGPD) to SCB under ‘bulk’ category and is collecting consumption charges.

However, the outbreak of Covid-19 has adversely impacted the water bill collections. “As per our calculations, the SCB is supposed to collect of Rs 85 lakh to Rs 1 crore in a month towards water supply. But we earned a meagre Rs 3 lakh in April and so far we have collected of Rs 5 lakh this month,” said SCB water wing superintendent, M Raj Kumar.

According to the official records, monthly bills are issued to 15,000 consumers, including domestic and non-domestic (commercial) premises. “For slum dwellers Rs 210 is charged and Rs 410 is collected from domestic consumers. As we don’t have water meter system in the cantonment it is difficult to assess the accurate supply and consumption,” he said, adding that several residents are not permitting bill collection due to restricted movement during the pandemic.

“Our staff are advising them to pay through our SCB portal www.scb.gov.in,” added the official.

PRAYAGRAJ: A Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) jawan, working as a driver, shot dead his wife and two kids and then committed suicide by shooting and hanging himself early Saturday morning. The incident occurred at CRPF Group Centre at Padila under Tharwai police station in Prayagraj.

ADG Prem Prakash said, “Vinod Kumar Yadav (41) was a driver in 224th Battalion of CRPF. He hailed from Sirsa area of Meja tehsil in Prayagraj and lived in a type-II quarter of the CRPF Group Centre in Padila with his family.”

“On Saturday, between 5.30 am and 6 am, Yadav first shot dead his wife Vimla (36), his 14-year old son Sandeep and 12-year-old daughter Simran. He then committed suicide by hanging himself. He shot himself also. The door of the house was locked from inside,” the ADG added.

Senior police and CRPF officials rushed to the spot on getting the news. Police also found a bullet injury on Yadav, but since the main entrance was locked from inside, police believe that he must have shot himself somehow.

“It is also learnt that Yadav used to get drunk and pass objectionable comments on a woman living in the opposite quarter. The woman, whose husband is posted outside, had reported the matter to senior officials and the deputy commandant of centre had summoned Yadav on Friday for giving his statement on the written complaint against him,” said ADG.

“On Friday night, Yadav started quarrelling in his house. When neighbours tried to intervene, he warned them to stay away from his personal matters. This could have triggered the incident,” he added. The bodies have been sent for post-mortem examination and the relatives of Yadav have been informed.

HYDERABAD: The Telangana high court has issued notices to the state BC welfare department commissioner to explain by June 15 as to why the authorities entrusted with the task of inquiring into the alleged misappropriation of funds meant for Mahatma Jyothiba Phule Jayanthi celebrations were failing in their duties.

The bench of Justice M S Ramachandra Rao and Justice K Lakshman gave these notices to the state and its ACB along with an alleged beneficiary Kundaram Ganesh Chary while hearing a PIL filed by Shivupalli Rajesham of Secunderabad.

Arguing the case of the petitioner, senior counsel S Satyam Reddy told the court that the state has released funds to an extent of 13 lakh for holding these celebrations in Hyderabad.

It named one individual as chairman of these celebrations committees in districts and released funds to them. They were all misused and were never spent for the intended purpose, he said. In Hyderabad, the misappropriation was more pronounced. The petitioner has been making representations to the state, its BC welfare officials and even the ACB. But none of them are responding, he said.

In Hyderabad, the celebrations committee chairman misappropriated 80 per cent of the funds, Satyam alleged.

The bench noticed that the officials did not respond in this case despite receiving notices in this case a few months ago and issued notices to them again. BC welfare commissioner was directed to file a report on the funds allocated and also on the way they were spent by June 15.

Despite completing their stipulated number of months on the ships, seafarers are having to stay put. As changing of crew is not being facilitated at many ports, those who have completed their training and are spending up to Rs 5 lakh are unable to join ships.

Most of the seafarers affected are from Srikakulam, Vizianagaram and Vizag in AP and Hyderabad in Telangana. At least 1,000 Telugu seafarers are stuck on different ships and another 2,300 are waiting to get on board. “The issue has been taken up and it is being facilitated at some ports.

Congress condemned Rao’s move to issue warning letters to headmasters five months after issuing show cause notices. The party has demanded a thorough inquiry into the department’s expenditure and sought Rao’s suspension till the inquiry is complete.

“The entire teaching community is being harassed by the department. He (Sawant) is harassing and hounding the headmasters, teachers and other staff of education department along with management,” Congress spokesperson Vithu Morajkar said.

He added that Rao was acting “vindictive” at the instructions of the chief minister.

He said that instead of spending money on online training classes, the government should resolve genuine issues such as releasing school maintenance grants, and paying teachers, both contract and permanent staff, who have not got salaries for a long time.

Doctors cite several examples where patients could have been saved from paralysis had they sought medical attention a couple of days earlier.Unlike previously, when even slightest symptoms were taken with utmost seriousness, since lockdown the tendency has been to delay going to hospitals due to fear of Covid-19 and unavailability of transport options, doctors reiterate.“Heart attacks and brain strokes are leading causes of death and disability. They should be treated within the golden hour,” said Dr Sudhir Kumar, senior consultant neurologist, Institute of Neurosciences, Apollo Hospitals referring to a recent case, where he received a call from a 65-year old man who developed mild weakness on his right hand and leg for 30 minutes. “Suspecting a brain stroke, I advised him to be rushed to hospital for urgent CT scan of brain. An hour later, I was informed that patient is reluctant to go to hospital due to fear of contracting Covid-19. About six hours later, his weakness worsened. He was unable to stand, walk or speak. When he finally came to hospital, CT scan showed a large clot in his brain. Clot-buster treatment could not be given as the golden hour was lost. Timely treatment could have resulted in rapid recovery, however, now, he is likely to remain disabled for months,” the doctor added.At NIMS, a patient was taken to hospital two days after onset of symptoms of brain stroke. “Patients with symptoms suggestive of paralysis, fits, brain fever, and unconsciousness should be rushed to hospital,” said a resident doctor.According to experts, attacks and brain strokes are the leading causes of death and disability today.

PRAYAGRAJ: Motilal Nehru National Institute of Technology-Allahabad ( MNNIT ) will conduct semester exam for its final year students online in view of the lockdown enforced due to the novel coronavirus (Covid-19) outbreak.

The move, which is first of its kind in the institute’s history, is likely to benefit 550 final-year students who have already landed job offers and have to join their respective firms by July.

MNNIT director Rajeev Tripathi said, “The decision to conduct exams online for final year students was taken in the wake of the prevailing situation and the need for maintaining social distancing. It would also help in quick evaluation and declaration of results.”

“Though we are still working out the modalities, the plan is to conduct a 30-mark online exam, while setting aside 30 marks for students’ previous performance. The marks students scored in their mid-semester and sessional examinations would account for the remaining 40 marks, which is the rule otherwise as well,” said Tripathi.

When they reached Chakeri in Kanpur, someone recorded their plight and uploaded the video on social media. The clip went viral.

Rajesh (15), the son of daily wager Raj Kumar, had his neck injured and could not walk. His father, however, could not arrange a vehicle.

Undeterred, he found a way out and travelled with a group of 18 villagers, carrying the cot for most part of the 800km route on foot. They reached Kanpur on Friday evening.

“I first tried to carry my son on my shoulder but it was difficult. So, I arranged a cot and gave it the shape of a palanquin. Except for a stretch of 50km covered on a truck, we carried the cot on our shoulders, taking turns, from Ludhiana to Kanpur,” said Rajkumar.

To their relief, a police team led by Chakeri inspector Ram Kumar provided them with food and water, and arranged a vehicle.

“After ensuring their well being, we sent the group in a vehicle to their village in Singrauli,” said Kumar.

Having come under criticism for slackness on road, especially during the third phase of lockdown, city police have now decided to register more offences rather than take coercive actions. On Friday, 76 offences were registered against violators and 20 were detained.

Joint CP Ravindra Kadam said many people had started taking undue advantage assuming that the lockdown has been relaxed. “There are relaxations in some sectors apart from the order of unhindered flow of the essential commodities and emergency services in the market but it does not mean that the citizens can step out without reason.

CHENNAI: The number of Covid-19 cases in Royapuram (zone 5), the initial hotspot in the city, has crossed 1,000. As on Saturday morning, the number of cases there were 1,047 — 18% of the total cases in the city.

Special nodal officer for Chennai J Radhakrishnan said they have devised a specific plan for Royapuram and it has been effected since Friday. “We have chosen ten clusters in Royapuram. Apart from regular awareness about the do’s, don’ts and hygiene, we have identified community halls to shift people living in most affected areas, which are densely populated,” Radhakrishnan said. “We have identified 10 localities within the zone and for each of them we have one area specific plans.” SM Nagar, Thideer Nagar, Anjaneyar Nagar, PK Raja Nagar and Sathya Nagar are some of the localities.

“Most of them are slums and getting people to even wear masks has become a difficult task,” said a zonal staff.

Officials said mass screening will be undertaken in the zone in the coming days and the residents will be given immunity boosters like kabasura kudineer, zinc tablets and other healthy foods.

On Saturday, residents from SM Nagar were shifted to a community hall nearby, where they will be monitored and provided with the herbal drink and healthy foods.

According to a zonal official, there are 12 community halls in the zone, apart from the government and corporation schools, which will also be used. “The community halls were used to house guest workers. Five of them are vacant now,” the official said.

While the initial cases in Royapuram were linked to the New Delhi conference cluster, the rise has been attributed to lack of physical distancing in the slum areas, which has forced authorities to rethink their plans.

“In areas where we were able to do effective containment, like in V R Pillai Street, we were able to control the amplification of cases. This has been difficult in the slums and so we have intensified our awareness programmes. Unfortunately, some of them still believe that they will not be infected,” a senior official said.

Apart from Royapuram zone, Kodambakkam (zone 10) and Valasaravakkam (zone 11) are challenging zones for the authorities. Kodambakkam follows Royapuram with 919 cases.

While Thiru Vi Ka Nagar abutting Royapuram witnessed a surge in cases overtaking Royapuram for a brief while, it has largely been stabilized and the number of cases in the zone stands at 737.

116,['17/05/2020'],"Protect livelihoods during lockdown, outfit tells govt","Coimbatore: Members of the Social Democratic Party of India (SDPI) on Saturday protested at several places in the city, urging the state to safeguard the livelihoods of people who have lost jobs to the nation-wide lockdown. They said the financial assistance of Rs 1,000 was not sufficient for two months of lockdown.

They protested at around 30 places in the city, by ensuring physical distancing.

Pointing out that many people haven’t had any jobs or means to livelihood for the past 50 days, Raja Husain, a district representative of SDPI, said, “The aid of Rs 1,000 would in no way be sufficient for running their families. Instead of helping the people with their livelihood, the state is now opening Tasmac outlets.”

He said there was a tendency among both the Centre and state to spread hate against a particular community during the Covid-19 pandemic. “The Centre has not provided the required funds and GST dues to the state.”

Husain said the BJP government at the Centre has been undermining the state’s rights under the cover of lockdown. “The state’s right in the Cauvery riparian issue has been undermined as the Centre has taken a decision to bring the Cauvery Water Management Authority under the Union Jal Shakti Ministry.”

The protesters also condemned the Centre’s move of using the lockdown to persecute activists under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Amendment Act.

As many as 286 outlets – 130 in the south zone and 156 in the north zone – were open for business a day after the Supreme Court stayed the high court’s direction to shut liquor shops and permitted sales through online platforms.

The number of people in the queue came down within hours after the shops opened. As per the guidelines, the outlets functioned from 10am to 5pm.

A Tasmac official said token system was followed in all outlets. “Only 70 tokens were distributed per hour. They were given only to those who were wearing masks and maintaining physical distance. Police personnel were deployed to prevent untoward incidents,” he said.

The outlets were allowed to sell liquor to 500 people per day, the official said. “Most of the shops had 350 to 450 customers. Only a few shops distributed all the 500 tokens. We experienced low customer turnout because most of the shops were open.”

While tokens were distributed to those in the queue at some shops, buyers were asked to collect tokens first before forming a queue at other places. Only 10 to 15 buyers were allowed to stand in front of the outlets.

While most of the tipplers were excited after buying their favourite brands, others complained about the price hike.

118,['17/05/2020'],Tamil Nadu: See-through face masks to ease stress for the hearing impaired,"CHENNAI: Living through the pandemic has been quite an ordeal, especially for those with speech and hearing impairments. Since the face masks available in the markets cover almost half the face, people who rely on lip-reading have been having a hard time communicating. In a move to remove the barrier, the state department for the welfare of differently-abled people has designed a special transparent mask with plastic sheet instead of cloth covering the lips.

This pilot project was initiated by the department’s secretary C Vijayaraj Kumar, making Tamil Nadu the first state in the country to provide such masks. They will be provided to workers and educators in early intervention centers, special schools, children, their parents, caregivers, and other stakeholders.

Johny Tom Varghese, director of the department, said 81,000 masks will be distributed to 13,500 children and adults who are hearing impaired and have speech difficulty. More will be distributed based on the response and need. “Parents as well as teachers who interact with the children will also need such masks. So we are providing them to not just people who are differently-abled but also to their dear ones.”

The masks were made in consultation with the hearing impaired and differently-abled associations in Tirupur. The material and comfort level of the masks were also tested on teachers and students with the disability.

Jesintha Rosalind, principal of the Little Flower Convent Higher Secondary School for the deaf, lauded the initiative and said the masks would help them teach their students without any hassle and also help the children live normally during this pandemic. “Since the lockdown was imposed, we found that many of our children found it challenging to carry out basic chores like going to a nearby grocery store because they couldn’t communicate. This deeply affected their confidence and made them more anxious. They will find these masks very helpful,” she said.

Dipti Karnad, principal of the Clarke School for the Deaf and the Mentally Retarded, said while the masks would help the hearing impaired, it would still be a challenge to reach out to those with visual impairment and multiple disabilities. “This is the group we are more concerned about since they depend on tactile signages and they need to be in close contact with us. With the safety and social distancing norms, we are worried about how we will manage them in the coming days,” she said.

MUMBAi: Police from two different states joined hands with the railways to transport medicines across 1,300km from Lucknow to Mumbai for an ailing filmwriter.Ankur Verma had tweeted to Uttar Pradesh police’s emergency helpline on May 10 that he was in urgent need of medicines for an anxiety disorder. The medicines were not available in local pharmacies nor on any portals. Within four days of his tweet, the medicines were delivered at Verma’s doorstep, thanks to some quick coordination among multiple agencies.Verma, who lives in Andheri, said he had been consulting a neurologist in Lucknow for a year. “I visit the doctor twice or three times a year. The medicines are couriered from Lucknow by my relatives. But with the lockdown, courier companies stopped delivering. I ran out of medicines and started desperately hunting for fresh supply,” he said.The filmwriter dialled a number of helplines but to no avail. “I was panicking. Anxiety disorders can give one suicidal thoughts. During my darkest hour, a radio jockey saw my post on social media and alerted UP police’s ‘112’ helpline,” said Verma. By then, the helpline operators had also seen Verma’s tweet. Sub-inspector Karuna Shankar Singh, in-charge of the helpline’s media cell, dialled Verma on the night of May 10.“I could sense something was amiss...Verma was answering my questions in monosyllables. I assured him of help and that he shouldn’t give up,” said Singh. Verma told the cop his mother, who lives in UP’s Unnao district, suffers from the same disorder and needed medicines too.Within 24 hours, UP police purchased the medicines from Lucknow and got them delivered to Unnao. When Verma learnt his mother had got her medicines, his stress levels reduced a little.“Verma’s medicines were already purchased by his uncle. We approached the railway police in Lucknow to inquire which trains were leaving for Mumbai. But only goods trains were plying and we were not sure if they would reach in time,” said Singh. Railway police suggested sending the medicines to Delhi first as trains were leaving from Delhi for Mumbai more regularly. A cop fetched the medicines from Verma’s uncle, took them to Delhi, and handed them to another constable who was to travel to Mumbai. Singh had already spoken to Mumbai police and two of their personnel picked up the medicines when the train reached Mumbai. Cops delivered the medicines right at Verma’s home on May 14. The film writer said he was overwhelmed and tweeted his appreciation for all the agencies. “I spoke to Verma after he had his meds and he sounded far better. We had a long conversation about yoga and fitness,” said Singh.",mumbai,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-75783413,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1987823,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/police-rlys-get-on-same-track-to-deliver-anxiety-meds-to-city-film-writer-from-up/articleshow/75782516.cms

The university syndicate approved to conduct the PhD viva-voce through video conferencing after considering the issues faced by PhD scholars. As per the existing norms, the scholars need to defend their thesis in public viva-voce to get the doctorate degree.

“Still, the public and interested people can participate in the online viva-voce by obtaining meeting ID and password. The date and time of the viva-voce, venue of examination, app or software to be used for the video conferencing with meeting ID and password will be uploaded on the university website 15 days in advance,” said P Duraisamy, university vice-chancellor. The university had to cancel viva-voce in March and April.

“More than 25 research scholars have submitted their thesis and have been waiting for viva-voce for more than two months,” he said.

The research supervisor, examiner and the candidate must, however, be physically present for the viva-voce. In a circular to all colleges, the university asked them to take all necessary precautions and safety measures such as social distancing, use masks.

The university also relaxed norms for submitting thesis evaluation reports. It used to accept evaluation reports from foreign and Indian examiners only through post after detecting manipulations by some examiners. “Under the present circumstance, it is not possible to send the reports through post. They can email the evaluation reports to the controller of examinations office,” Duraisamy added.

DEHRADUN: Uttarakhand ’s chief minister Trivendra Singh Rawat has directed officials to ensure thermal screening facilities at all district borders .

Currently, thermal screening is being conducted at state borders and long queues due to the process prolong travel time for passengers.

In view of this, the CM has asked to conduct thermal screening at all district borders and reduce burden on state borders.

Regarding locals returning to state, CM Rawat has instructed the district magistrates to make sure that teams keep an eye on them to ensure that home quarantine norms are being followed.

HbA1c test indicates the average blood glucose level over a period of three months and is recommended for the control of diabetes.“People who were part of the assessment in Hyderabad on an average were of the age of 52 years, out of which, 52% were male and 48% female. The average postprandial glucose level in the group was 244 mg/dl in the quarter and the average fasting glucose level was 172 mg/dl,” said the study, conducted by Novo Nordisk Education Foundation.Experts in the city second the findings of the survey and have said that the patients who previously had blood sugar under control, are now dealing with an imbalance. “At least 60% to 65% of the patients have seen a rise in their blood sugar levels. I see patients who earlier had controlled their HbA1c level around 7, but now have it around 9-10,” said Dr Sanjoy Paul, a diabetologist at Apollo Sugar Clinics.“Apart from inactivity due to lockdown, stress and phobia of Covid-19, and not getting insulin is a major reason for increase in blood sugar levels,” added Paul.The rise in HbA1C level comes at a time when medical studies are pointing towards an increased risk for severe complications arising from Covid-19 in people living with diabetes. “People living with diabetes are more likely to experience severe symptoms and complications if they get infected with the virus and this may even worsen if their diabetes is not managed well,” said Dr KD Modi, senior consultant endocrinologist at Care Hospital.“It can also lead to more fatalities.

135,['17/05/2020'],"Kolkata: No fare revision for private buses, autos, cabs for now, says government","KOLKATA: The state government on Saturday refused to approve a special lockdown fare hike to compensate for reduced passenger capacity in buses and autos. The decision puts into question the fate of private bus and autorickshaw operations from Monday when demand for transport is set to rise as more offices start functioning.Metered taxis, too, may stay off the road as their demand for a hike has also been turned down. The taxi operators had joined the fare hike bandwagon despite the social distancing norms not directly affecting their revenue. Private transport operators said the only way they could now hit the roads is if the government made good the loss by providing a ‘viability gap funding’.Setting aside suggestions of a three-fold fare hike demanded by bus operators, who wanted the base fare to go up from Rs 7 to Rs 20, state transport minister Suvendu Adhikari said the existing fares would persist despite buses being permitted to carry only 20 passengers at any given point of time and autos allowed only two persons instead of four. Demand by taxi operators to increase the minimum fare by a third from Rs 30 to Rs 40 was also turned down.“Our chief minister Mamata Banerjee always takes a humanitarian approach. When economy is under stress and people are losing jobs, we cannot allow such hike in fares. The Centre can provide relief by reducing fuel price at a time when the international crude oil price has touched an all-time low,” Adhikari said at the state secretariat.With the prospect of private operators now staying off the road, the minister promised more government buses from Monday. “People can avail of a bus every half an hour instead of one hour now. Some 1,000 app-cabs will also hit the road. We hope people will not face much problem,” he said. Around 20 trams will also start operations.Whether enhanced services by (state transport undertakings) STUs and cabs would suffice the heightening travel need can be gauged on Monday. Just by statistics, on an average weekday, under normal circumstances, private buses ferry 42.8 lakh commuters while STU buses carry 15.6 lakh passengers. If private buses remain off the road, there can be great commuting trauma.“In case of contract-carriage like cabs and other pre-paid transport mode, social distancing does not affect their business. So, there is no question of an upward revision of fare,” Adhikari said.However, the same does not hold true for stage-carriage where the fare is kept low and break-even or profit depends on passenger volume. “If the fare is not hiked, we cannot run bus. Forget the recovery of operating cost, at old fare with 20 passengers at a time, each bus operator will bleed to death. Even fuel cost cannot be recovered. If fare cannot be hiked, let the government make viability gap funding,” said Joint council of Bus Syndicates general secretary Tapan Bandyopadhayay Earlier on Thursday, Adhikari had asked the private bus operators to decide special lockdown fare, which would have been approved by the state government, keeping in mind the fact that a reduced number of passengers would be ferried at a time in each bus. Accordingly, the bus operators prepared a fare table and sent it to the transport department for approval and notification. But on Saturday, state government decided not to raise fare, keeping in mind the current state of the economy.",kolkata,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-75783612,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-187214,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/no-fare-revision-for-pvt-buses-autos-cabs-for-now-says-govt/articleshow/75782568.cms

137,['17/05/2020'],Waste generated by families in home quarantine not segregated,"Dehradun: The disposal of masks and gloves used by people in home quarantine, labeled as “domestic hazardous waste” by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), is not being handled with proper care in Uttarakhand.

A total of 49,000 people are in home quarantine in the state, 4,500 of them in Dehradun, of whom six have tested positive for the coronavirus. While the health department is segregating and safely disposing of biomedical waste generated from quarantine centres and hospitals and the civic body is taking care of hazardous waste generated in containment zones, the disposables discarded by those in home quarantine elsewhere is getting mixed with other waste, increasing the risk of Covid-19 spread.

A total of 3,531 persons are in self-isolation in Haridwar, the state’s only remaining red zone. In Chamoli, 6,515 people are in home quarantine, 5,276 in Tehri, 7,210 in Udham Singh Nagar and 4,460 in Pauri. As per CPCB, local authorities must maintain a list of homes where people are in self-quarantine and hazardous waste must be collected from these doorsteps in separate bags. Such waste should only be handled by trained workers equipped with protective gear. “My neighbour is in home quarantine. The practice of mixing all kinds of waste poses a great risk,” said Umesh Karanwal, a resident of Old Survey Road.

Anoop Nautiyal, founder of Dehradun-based research organization ‘Social Development for Communities” (SDC), believes that the issue of collection and disposal of “hazardous waste” generated by people in quarantine is being taken lightly.

“We have come to know that in the hills, there is no concrete policy for waste collection from those serving home quarantine. I would request the government to formulate a strict policy for the management of such waste, as it can trigger spread of the infection,” he said. While director general (health) Dr Amita Upreti couldn’t be contacted by TOI,despite repeated attempts, a senior health department official, who did not wish to be named, said that the department is ensuring proper disposal of biomedical waste from quarantine facilities and hospitals. “We have already shared guidelines of waste management with the Nagar Nigam. The civic body has to ensure the disposal of waste generated by people in home quarantine,” he said.

Kailash Joshi, chief municipal health officer, on the other hand said that the health department should be collecting hazardous waste from homes where people are in quarantine, as there was no way for the civic body to identify such homes. “In containment zones, we give protective gears to our workers and make sure to separately collect masks and gloves used by people who might be infected. We sanitize such waste and expose them in the sun for sterilization. However, it is impossible to identify the homes where people are in quarantine in the rest of the city. With limited manpower, it is not feasible for us to collect masks and gloves separately,” said Joshi. He added that those in home quarantine must themselves collect hazardous waste in separate bags before handing it over to sanitation workers, so they can handle it with proper care.

Yugal Kishore Pant, additional secretary health, said, “The families can also leave such waste at nearby hospitals, from where it will go to medical waste management plants. Otherwise, they can separate the waste and alert sanitation workers while handing it over,” he added.

NEW DELHI: Delhi recorded the highest number of domestic violence cases during the nearly two-months-long lockdown period, lagging behind only Uttarakhand and Haryana.

In a first of its kind effort to document who needed legal aid during the lockdown, the National Legal Services Authority (NALSA) has documented cases till May 15 under various categories, including domestic violence, in which Delhi saw 63 cases where distraught women reached out to counsellors seeking immediate help.

NALSA, that reports to its executive chairman, Supreme Court Justice N V Ramana, compiled the paper after collecting data from 28 different State Legal Services Authorities (SLSAs). On domestic violence, the report shows only Uttarakhand (144) and Haryana (79) are the two full fledged states that witnessed more cases of domestic violence than the capital during lockdown.

Detailing the break up of legal help extended, the report says NALSA units reached out to tenants facing eviction, migrants, labourers denied wages and prisoners.

For instance, around 60,000 inmates (under trial prisoners and convicts) were released on bail or parole during the lockdown, in a bid to decongest jails to lower coronavirus threat where NALSA and state units played an active role. As per the report, a total of 42,259 undertrial prisoners were released from jails across the country during the lockdown period where Uttar Pradesh released highest number of 9,977.

Delhi’s legal aid services worked to secure release of 2,177 UTPs and 1,010 convicts, apart from deputing legal aid lawyers for 250 newly arrested persons at remand stage.

The report said due to extraordinary times, extraordinary measures were taken and pointed out that legal representation has also been provided to 9,558 persons at the remand stage in different States and Union Territories across the country. NALSA says during the lockdown period, several poor and needy persons approached it with grievances relating to denial of wages/salaries by employers on behalf of themselves as well as, other daily wagers.

“Out of the same, 1,822 people were provided with legal aid and assistance by the Legal Services Authorities. The highest number of such cases were reported in Uttarakhand (226) followed by Haryana (221), Punjab (166), Himachal Pradesh (77) and Mizoram (38). Legal aid and assistance was provided in all such cases,” it said, adding that legal aid and assistance was provided to 1,018 people of Bihar.

144,['17/05/2020'],End of licence Raj as monopoly on coal goes,"Representative image

NEW DELHI: The government will immediately offer 50 coal mines for commercial mining by private sector without end-use restrictions, removing one of the last vestiges of the licence-quota Raj of the 70s with a view to unlocking the sector’s potential to substitute imports and drive growth.

The government’s move is expected to boost domestic production and lead to reduced coal imports, resulting in estimated savings of Rs 1.7 lakh crore or more. Private investments in new mines will also create thousands of jobs and big earnings for coal-bearing states.

Unleashing a wave of reforms in the sector that counts as one of the largest employers in the country, finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman said the mines will be auctioned on revenue-sharing basis under a simplified regime to increase ease of doing business.

Government will not put any eligibility restriction but only upfront payment with a ceiling with a view to attracting wider participation and creating competition. In other words, companies can bid even if they do not have experience in coal mining and sell the output in the open market. Addressing a major concern of prospective investors, successful bidders will be allowed to raise production by up to 40% from a mine every year without seeking green clearance afresh.

The announcement, part of the Rs 20 lakh-crore stimulus promised by PM Narendra Modi , is seen to complete the process of unshackling coal mining from the nationalisation of 1973 and opens doors for large private investments by ending public sector Coal India Ltd’s (CIL) monopoly in the market. How far investments will come in at a time of a stressed economy is unclear, but the signal to capital is clear.

Currently only CIL is allowed to sell coal to end-users. Private coal mining is allowed only for captive mining with restricted end-use such as generating power or making cement and steel. In 2018, they were allowed to sell 25% of the output but it failed to attract much investment.

The minister announced a Rs 50,000-crore investment plan for creating infrastructure such as railway tracks and conveyors to evacuate coal from old and new mines and support CIL’s plan to raise production from 600 million tonne to a billion tonne in 2023-24. Rights to extract gas trapped in seams of coal (CBM) in CIL’s mines will also be auctioned to diversify investment opportunities in the sector. According to Essar Oil & Gas Exploration & Production CEO Vilas Tawde , the two initiatives will help unlock 90 TCF (trillion cubic feet) methane trapped in CIL’s lease area.

Providing relief worth Rs 5,000 crore to non-power consumers of CIL, the reserve price has been reduced.

The foundation of these reforms was laid in 2015 by adding an enabling clause in the Coal Nationalisation Act during the Narendra Modi government’s first term. But it was in February 2018 that the government started turning the clock back on nationalisation of the coal sector by opening up commercial coal mining to private sector. In October the same year, it allowed captive coal miners to sell 25% of their output in the open market. While both these decisions technically ended state-run Coal India’s monopoly on commercial coal mining, the situation on the ground did not reflect this as the private sector mostly stayed away from auctions.

Finally on January 9 this year, the government cleared an ordinance to introduce relaxed norms for entry of private sector through amendments to the Coal Mines (Special Provisions) Act of 2015 and Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulations) Act of 1957.

147,['17/05/2020'],"Goa: Now, government gives farmers better access to market, offers e-nam","Photo used for representational purpose only

PANAJI: The Goa government, through an ordinance, has brought about changes to the Agriculture Produce Marketing Committee ( APMC ) Act , eliminating the services of middlemen and giving farmers direct access to the market to sell their produce for better returns. Incidentally, the notification to this effect came on Friday, the same day on which when the Centre unleashed crucial and long-pending reforms to reshape the architecture of farmer-market ties and allowing them to sell their produce without any restrictions.

Farmers will now be exempted from paying the market fee and allowed to sell their produce to private players. They will be able to directly sell farm produce to any private entity or food processing company from farm-gates and registered warehouses without the licensing mechanism of registered ‘mandis’ (agri markets) currently run under the Agricultural Produce Marketing Committee (APMC) Act.

The move aims at securing better income to the farmers and giving a big push to the agriculture sector and help state become self-reliant.

“There will be no agriculture tax on the produce sold. This will benefit farmers having cashew plantations , coconut groves, okra and betel nut kullagars in Goa,” said registrar of cooperative societies, Vikas Gaunekar.

He said earlier the Goa agricultural marketing board used to generate a revenue of about Rs 4 cr per year in the form of tax. “Now, this money stays with the farmers,” he said.

However, market fee on notified agricultural produce will still be levied only on produce which is brought into the state by traders. Farmers from any part of the country who wish to sell their produce to Goa will be exempted from the fee of 1%.

“This way, the farmers will be able to carry out end-to-end marketing without the need of middle men. Also, they’re not restricted to a certain ‘mandi’ and trading can be carried out at yards or at private markets. The choice is up to the farmers,” said Gaunekar.

The Act now also includes livestock, making it the Goa agricultural and livestock marketing board. Earlier livestock was merely considered to be an agricultural produce.

The trading regulation issued by the state government read that all notified agricultural produce including livestock shall ordinarily be sold in the principal market yards, sub-market yards and market sub-yards licensed under this Act.

“We have complied with the 2017 model law of the central government. The entire Act needs to be amended subsequently, but for now, these changes have been made in the ordinance,” Gaunekar said.

The amendment also largely covers the legal backing required to facilitate the electronic national agricultural market ( e-nam ).

Here, the farmers can directly feed details of the produce on the portal and without any middle men pay a nominal commission to the facilitator and sell the produce directly to the buyer online. Here, registration, buying and selling, billing, booking, contracting and negotiating are carried out online.

“The Goa Agricultural and Livestock Marketing Board is already in the process of setting up an RKKY mandi in Ponda where it is being proposed to facilitate this service,” Gaunekar said.

BHOPAL: Ahead of lockdown 4.0 from Monday, chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan has hinted at the much-awaited cabinet expansion in the coming week.

Sources in BJP disclosed that Chouhan is constantly discussing with the party high command on the possibility of cabinet expansion and once he gets the go-ahead, he will be ready to expand his ministerial team in the first week of lockdown 4.0 itself.

“The CM had on Thursday during an interview with a local television channel confirmed that after lockdown 3.0, he will talk to the party high command on the possibility of cabinet expansion. At present, he is busy in preparations for lockdown 4.0 and if the party gives a go-ahead, the cabinet expansion will be done immediately,” disclosed BJP state spokesperson Rajneesh Agrawal.

BJP state in-charge Vinay Sahasrabuddhe also made clear that the cabinet expansion will be done at the right time. “The cabinet expansion is taking time since the government is busy in tackling the ongoing Covid crisis. It will be done at the right time,” he said.

Sources in BJP disclosed that the state leadership is also making preparations for a possible rejig in the coming week and hinted that 22 Jyotiraditya Scindia loyalists, who had resigned as MLAs on March 10, will get berths and tickets for the upcoming bypolls.

BJP leaders have also made it clear that the formation of the new government took place with the support of former Union minister Scindia and his supporters. The party high command has clearly indicated that they will be adjusted first, added sources.

Chouhan took oath of office as chief minister amid the Covid-19 crisis and decided to form a mini-cabinet after 29 days when the party leadership gave a green signal. Five ministers were accommodated in the mini cabinet of which two are from the Scindia camp.

With lockdown 3.0 nearing its end, the CM is seeking the high command’s nod for another expansion so that the functioning of the government amid the coronavirus crisis becomes effective.

The CM also met governor Lalji Tandon and RSS regional head Deepak Vaspute recently. Sources in BJP disclosed that the new cabinet will accommodate 24 members with more than 8 members as ministers of state.

The party leadership has also hinted that those who served as ministers in the previous Congress government will be included. Decision on other members, including senior MLAs, will be taken after discussions with the national leadership.

According to an official spokesperson, the advisory committee of department of water resources, river development and Ganga rejuvenation (DoWR, RD&GR) accorded approval in its 144th meeting, which was chaired by secretary to the Government of India, DoWR, RD & GR, MoJS, U P Singh.

Keeping in view the strategic importance of the project — for the utilisation and regulation of waters flowing across the border and for potential use of the stored water in an optimal manner in the future — the committee accepted the project proposal, subject to certain conditions.

Pertinently, Ujh multipurpose project was declared a national project in 2008 and its DPR was initially prepared by Indus Basin Organisation of Central Water Commission in 2013.

The DPR was considered in the 131st meeting of the advisory committee, which was held on November 16. Subsequently, the DPR of the project was revised so as to address the concerns regarding submergence of land.

Official spokesperson said, “The revised DPR of the project was accepted by the advisory committee in its 139th meeting, which was held on January 7, 2019.”

The Culturable Command Area (CCA) to be irrigated under the project was proposed as 16,743 hectare with proposed irrigation intensity of 187%.

Meanwhile, the irrigation and flood control department, J&K, framed a modified proposal of Ujh multipurpose project for the inclusion of the additional CCA of 23,973 hectare — beyond the scope of the Ujh MPP already approved in the 139th meeting of the advisory committee.

NEW DELHI: Direct flight routes by making hitherto restricted airspace available to commercial airlines, which will lead to savings of about Rs 1,000 crore annually in operating cost for airlines, was among three major announcements made by finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman for India’s critically ill aviation sector on Saturday.

The other two are six more Airports Authority of India (AAI) airports will be handed over for being run in public-private partnership and aircraft maintenance centres will be facilitated in India.

She said, “Only 60% of Indian airspace is freely available. Restrictions on (its) utilisation will be eased so that civilian flying becomes more efficient. This will bring a benefit of about Rs 1,000 crore per year for the aviation sector through lower fuel burn and crew cost by way of reduction in flying time.”

AAI had last year decided to hand over six more airports — Bhubaneswar, Varanasi, Raipur, Indore, Amritsar and Trichy — to PPP players. Bidding was held in 2018 for six airports and Adani Group had emerged as the highest bidder for all of them.

All these announcements were made when PM Modi had reviewed aviation sector on May 1.

154,['17/05/2020'],Ministry’s bid to merge NTCA offices faces criticism,"Nagpur: Union environment ministry’s move to restructure its offices and centres, especially National Tiger Conservation Authority ( NTCA ) offices by merging them with MoEFCC regional offices, has come in for sharp criticism from conservationists and wildlife activists.

The issue was discussed at length in a meeting headed by director general of forests (DGF) Sanjay Kumar on May 2 and accordingly course of action is being planned. Both, Kumar and environment minister Prakash Javadekar did not respond to TOI e-mails on the issue.

Sources told TOI this entire exercise was kept a secret and even officials in regional offices were not aware about its objectives. They said the MoEFCC was particularly interested in subsuming the regional offices of NTCA, Wildlife Crime Control Bureau (WCCB), Forest Survey of India (FSI) and Central Zoo Authority (CZA). The stated objective is to improve efficiency and better coordination.

“Each of these organisations has a different mandate and purpose with some convergence– tiger conservation, tackling wildlife crime, zoo management etc— and merging these will weaken focused efforts while also losing autonomy which is critical to each task,” said wildlife author and conservationist Prerna Bindra.

“The need is to strengthen and empower NTCA, WCCB, FSI, & CZA to ensure transparency and efficiency to safeguard our environment and protect forests and wildlife, whose relevance has been further underscored at this point in time,” she said.

Recently, MoEFCC officials were on a controversial project clearing-spree during lockdown period affecting wildlife and now it seems they are busy restructuring regional offices. Conservationists have asked clearances granted during lockdown be stopped.

Senior officials told TOI on anonymity, the reorganization exercise promoted by a section of babus of the ministry misses the wood for the trees. Agencies such as NTCA, WCCB & CZA were created by the amendment of Wildlife (Protection) Act (WPA), 1972 with a clear mandate to protect wildlife and biodiversity.

“The proposed reorganization is in direct violation of the provisions the WPA and defeats the very purpose for which these specialized agencies were created by the lawmakers,” they said.

DP Bankwal, ex-PCCF & IG of NTCA, Guwahati, said the intended restructuring of regional offices was fraught with risk for statutory organizations like NTCA. At practical level, under a boss who is poorly sensitized for wildlife conservation but highly driven for clearing developmental projects, the office business will ‘improve’ at the expense of conservation.

“The voice of lowly AIG level officer for integrity of wildlife habitat and reducing the stress and interface between wildlife and human beings will either go unheard or be smothered,” said Bankwal.

Talking to TOI, NTCA member-secretary Anup Kumar Nayak said, “Though things are yet to be decided, we have given it in writing and also clearly told even if merger takes place, NTCA’s line of command should not be disturbed. We don’t have any problem in sitting in one office. ‘Project Tiger’ has been hugely successful as India witnessed increase in tiger numbers from 1,411 in 2006 to 2,967 in 2018, mainly due to NTCA’s management inputs, village relocation and eco-tourism activities.”

However, minutes of the meeting (copy with TOI) held with DGF on May 2, doesn’t reflect the stand taken by Nayak.

Why NTCA should not merge

* It implements ‘Project Tiger’ that has helped tiger numbers go up

* Proposed reorganization may end up creating multiple hierarchies leading to administrative confusion and chaos

* NTCA is perceived as anti-development it has been objecting to destructive projects across India

* Reorganization may be another step to grant speedier clearances to detrimental projects

* If proposed land diversion falls in tiger reserve corridors, NTCA will not be able to do an independent assessment

* India is a global leader in tiger conservation due to NTCA. Reorganization may result in losing that status

The agency has informed contractors to undertake the repair work of the highway stretching from Kalyan to Igatpuri, Nashik and Malegaon. They are expected to complete the work before the arrival of the monsoon season.

The important work is at prominent ghat sections at Igatpuri and Kasara, as they are more prone to landslides during heavy rain.

In fact, few cracks opened up near Kasara ghat the last monsoon as vehicle movement was stopped for a few days.

“These contractors used to engage migrant workers from Bihar, UP, MP, etc for the pre-monsoon work. But since a large section of the workers have returned back to their villages due to the lockdown, the contractors are facing a shortage of manpower to carry out the work smoothly,” said NHAI officials.

The highway officials said that it would ensure that despite shortage of men the contractors will complete the pre-monsoon work before the arrival of rain.

162,['17/05/2020'],Chouhan writes to 7 CMs for info on migrant workers,"Bhopal: Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan wrote letters to the chief ministers of seven states on Saturday seeking details about information of labourers passing through Madhya Pradesh to other states. He said if timely information is available adequate arrangements can be made for their onward travel and food.

In the letter, Chouhan has written to the CMs of Maharashtra, Gujarat, Rajasthan, Karnataka, Telangana, Jharkhand and Chhattisgarh that is that since MP does not get to know how many labourers from other states are reaching the state borders and at what time it is becoming to make logistics available.

Chouhan said in the letter that free arrangements for food, vehicles and medicines are made by the MP government. Due to lack of prior information about the movement of the labourers, many times the system gets disturbed when large number of labourers come and create law and order situation due to panic and the labourers also have to face difficulties.

In the letter, Chouhan has said that during the nationwide lockdown announced to tackle Corona, large number of migrant labourers from different parts are leaving for their respective states. Due to the geographical location of MP being in the heart of the country, the labourers going to Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Rajasthan, Jharkhand and many other states from different states are crossing MP.

MP government is providing vehicles, food, medicines free of cost to these migrant labourers coming to their border, besides providing them bus facility to those walking and dropping them at the borders. About one thousand buses have been deployed to ferry the labourers of other states from the border of MP to the border of other states. MP government has ensured that no labourer walks on the soil of the state.

163,['17/05/2020'],"Huge drop in income, work for Delhi’s native workers: Study","Nagpur: Almost two months into the lockdown, most poor and non-migrant workers in New Delhi have seen their incomes and working days drop by at least 57% and 73%, respectively.

This was revealed in the latest study of non-migrant workers done by researchers at the University of Chicago and the University of British Columbia . Researchers found widespread compliance with public health directives important in reducing the spread of the virus, as rates of mask usage, handwashing, and social distancing increased.

By early-May, nine out of 10 survey respondents stated that their weekly income had fallen to zero. Despite this unprecedented job loss, the study finds widespread compliance with public health directives. Compared to levels before the arrival of Covid-19, mask usage rose from 20% (during the air pollution season) to 90%, time spent indoors increased from 44% to 95% and regular handwashing rose from 88% to 98%.

“Even for non-migrant workers in Delhi, the lockdown has been devastating economically. It also brought about a massive change in behavior. People started wearing masks more, they started staying indoors and socialized less, they washed their hands more regularly, there were even fewer reports of smoking. These habits are crucial for limiting the spread and the health impacts of the virus,” said Dr Ken Lee, executive director of the Energy Policy Institute at the University of Chicago in India (EPIC India) and the lead author of the study.

The researchers pointed to the role of extreme fear and media coverage in driving these unprecedented behavioral changes. “Throughout the lockdown, 80% of people reported feeling extremely concerned about Covid-19. To demonstrate the unparalleled media coverage of Covid-19, the researchers used Twitter data to show that since March 25, Covid-19 coverage has accounted for more than 56% of all media coverage,” a release by EPIC India stated.

“For this particular group of mostly non-migrant workers in Delhi, we have not yet seen alarming changes in rates of hunger, access to health care, scarcity, or security. A lot of people reported benefiting from the Delhi government’s food assistance programme. That said, the latest projections expect a surge in infections in the coming months and so the government should prepare itself to rapidly expand these types of assistance programs,” said Dr Lee.

Apart from this, the study noted there were relatively high rates of mental and emotional well-being problems, ongoing challenges in food supply chains, in terms of higher prices and lower quantities, and dwindling levels of reported savings.

The study was based on data collected from 1,392 non-migrant workers, many of whom live in the capital’s informal settlements. The data was collected in 2018, 2019, and during the lockdown, between March 27 and May 13.

LOCKDOWN EFFECT

- Incomes of non-migrant workers dropped by 57%

- Working days dropped by 73%

- Mask usage rose from 20% to 90%

- Time spent indoors increased from 44% to 95%

- Time spent indoors increased from 44% to 95%

PANAJI: The Goa Common Entrance Test (GCET) can be expected to be held in the first week of July, officials in the directorate of technical education (DTE) said.

The exam is held for admissions to engineering and pharmacy degree programme seats in Goa. GCET was to be conducted originally on May 5-6, but had to be deferred due to the pandemic and the resultant lockdown.

Pending semester exams for diploma programmes in the state too are likely to begin from June 15, said officials.

“DTE has proposed to have GCET in the first week of July. We are hoping that everything will be fine by then. But the dates are yet to be confirmed. Once we get confirmation, the admission schedule can be fixed. The admission schedule, with dates for each admission round can be expected to be declared by June 15,” said a source. The admission rounds for professional degree programmes, based on GCET scores, are mostly likely to be held in August, official said.

The GCET will be held in physics, chemistry and mathematics across 15 centres in the state.

Last year around 3,400 students registered themselves to appear for the GCET.

DTE was waiting for the state board to declare the dates for the three remaining Class XII exam papers to be able to decide on the new schedule for GCET. Last week, the board announced that the remaining Class XII papers will be held from May 20-22.

Also, exams of different semesters for the diploma programmes in engineering, pharmacy and hotel management could not be held this year as scheduled in March-April due to the lockdown.

“Semester exams for diploma programmes may also will be held from June 15 to July 15. We have five polytechnic institutes in the state, besides two hotel management schools, one each in Verna and Curchorem ,” said the official.

166,['17/05/2020'],Odia migrants in Kerala in dire straits,"Bhubaneswar: At least 96 stranded Odia migrant workers at two different places — Kozhikode and Kottayam — in Kerala urged the Odisha government to help them return home. As they don’t have money and ration, they are desperately trying to return, said a labourer.

Bhabagrahi Barad, 35, a native of Dihakhauruni near Rajsunakhala in Nayagarh district, is stranded along with 75 others at Koothali in Kozhikode of Kerala. “We had come here seven months ago to work in a construction company. Some of us are working as masons while others are construction labourers. We came here because this Kerala firm gives Rs 600 as wage per day. The wage is high. But now we don’t have any job here so we want to return home,” he added.

The workers belong to Khurda, Nayagarh and Cuttack districts. “We had last received our wages on March 20. Though the company had provided food for some days, the construction work has not yet started. Our family members are worried. We have registered our names in Odisha government’s portal. We also met local police, but in vain,” he added.

Manas Kumar Pradhan, 32, a native of Begunia in Khurda district, said they don’t have money to arrange buses to return home. “Only three Shramik Special trains have been run between Kerala and Odisha. We request the government to run more such trains and provide us tickets for travelling,” he added.

He said they have many aged people among them and their family members are calling them to return. “We don't know how to get tickets for Shramik Special trains. Nobody gives proper information about the special trains and the procedure to get tickets,” he added.

Jitendra Behera, 32, a native of Champatipur in Nayagarh district, said he along with 19 people from Khurda and Nayagarh districts came to Kottayam seven months ago in search of work. “We were working as construction labourers in a real estate company. Our work was stopped on March 21. We do not have any job and we spent our money in purchasing ration and food. Anyhow we have to return home,” he added.

He said they don’t want to walk or cycle back to Odisha. “We saw migrant people are dying on roads. We don’t want to take any risk. I am the only son of my parents, that’s why they are calling me everyday and insisting on my return. We are also feeling nervous as we don’t have money to hire a bus. We request the government to give tickets for travelling in special trains,” said Behera.

167,['17/05/2020'],Remdesivir vs Favipiravir &amp; other repurpose drugs for Covid-19,"India needs to urgently decide on a course of medicines for Covid-19 treatment. The virus is here to stay, at least in the near-term. A vaccine too, is a while away.

There are at least 50 different drugs, from HIV protease inhibitors to anti-virals to ACE inhibitors, anti-inflammatory, pneumonia, respiratory, malaria, TB, arthritis, leprosy, alcohol dependence, immune modulators, and anti-diarrhoea that are being tested.

But the Indian Council of Medical Research has approved a Lopinavir-Ritonavir fixed dose combination (FDC), that was originally prescribed for the treatment of HIV/AIDS, for Covid-19 patients. Clinical studies in drug repurposing and FDC, involve the testing of optimal dosage on limited number of patient cohorts. When time is of the essence, drug dosage and efficacy as well as side effects are clearly known for repurposed drugs. These drugs also offer the advantage of typically being off-patent (the older ones) and are already being manufactured by Indian generic pharmaceutical companies. The Task Force for Repurposing of Drugs ranked Favipiravir and Tocilizumab as the most promising to fight the disease.

The fresh arrival in the treatment armoury is Remdesivir, an RNA polymerase inhibitor; it stops the coronavirus from replicating. Gilead Sciences, USA, discovered Remdesivir to combat the 2014 Africa Ebola virus outbreak. It has now resurrected this molecule through an accelerated solidarity clinical trial.

Gilead owns the patent rights for Remdesivir, granted by the Indian Patent Office on February 18 this year. The manufacture and sale of Remedesivir will require terms to be negotiated between Indian drug firms and Gilead. Important observations made by the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) and US Food and Drug Administration (US-FDA) are that Remdesivir can shorten recovery from 15 days to 11 and improve death rate from 11.6% to 8%. Remdesivir is administered intravenously, which implies that patients will need to be in a hospital setting.

Favipiravir is a purine nucleic acid analog and potent RNA dependent RNA polymerase inhibitor approved for use in influenza. Both “virs” act by a similar RNA virus cell disruption mechanism. A few Indian firms have been granted permission for clinical trials on Favipiravir, including the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR).

Published results of a clinical trial of Favipiravir show that out of 80 patients, 35 who got the drug demonstrated significantly shorter viral clearance time compared to 45 in the control arm (those who didn't) - with median recovery of four days compared to 11. The 7 days' clinical recovery rate also increased from 55.86% to 71.43% in the drug arm.

Favipiravir is a bioavailable pill marketed as Avigan by Fujifilm in Japan. Patents were filed in India around the year 2000 and its manufacturing process for economical production is largely in place. The molecular complexity of Remdesivir (formula: C27 H35 N6 O8 P), together with chirality of the molecule or a single-handedness, mean that its synthesis difficulty and manufacturing process will be a bigger challenge and with a higher cost than Favipiravir (C5 H4 F N3 O2). Remdesivir is a new drug with its synthetic route and a scale-up unoptimized as of today.

Favipiravir could be an affordable COVID-19 drug, subject to favourable outcome in human clinical trials.

""The test does not look for the current, but past infection or exposure to the virus. For the sick, a molecular test called PCR continues to be the gold standard,"" Abraham told TOI.But does the detection of the IgG antibody mean the person is now resistant to reinfection? ""No, it is solely dependent on the concentration of the antibody in the blood - it's called the 'antibody titer'. It is yet to be studied for Covid-19,"" Abraham said.The presence of some antibodies in the blood does not guarantee protection from recurrence. There has to be that optimum concentration of the antibodies in the blood. In other words, it is the strength and longevity of the antibody in the person's blood that will determine protection against the virus to some extent, experts said.""That longevity of the antibody can be determined by our Elisa test. We can fairly predict how long the Covid-19 antibodies will last in the human body. However, the strength of the antibody needs to be determined by other assays. It is yet to be studied for Covid-19,"" Abraham said.One reason the development of serological or blood tests for Covid-19 has lagged behind molecular (PCR) tests is that the process requires a supply of blood from recovered (convalescent) patients. But the team of ICMR-NIV researchers, led by scientists Gajanan Sapkal and Pragya Yadav, developed the Elisa-based blood test in a record one month.The collection of blood samples from recovered patients (and negative patients) was a challenge. ""Scientists at ICMR-NIV took efforts by personally interacting with Covid-19 patients in the hospital to collect blood samples,"" Abraham said.The Elisa test can help answer big public health questions - including how many people have actually been infected - by carrying out mass testing/surveillance activity in hotspots or particular demographics. ""It was an urgent national priority to develop the Elisa test for Covid-19 and hand over the technology to an Indian firm for mass production after many imported rapid test kits were found faulty. The specificity of the ELISA test is generally higher than the rapid tests,"" Abraham said.One of the main challenges in containing the spread of SARS-CoV-2 is the diagnosis of a large population. ""The majority of asymptomatic cases might have remained undetected due to limited resources for molecular (PCR) diagnosis. Random screenings using our Elisa test, even at specific locations that are still naive to the disease, will help determine the actual burden of the disease. It will help estimate the virus spread in the community,"" Abraham said.",pune,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-75783340,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-59903,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/niv-test-can-trace-covid-19-antibody-just-days-after-infection/articleshow/75783018.cms

PANAJI: Goa police have fined over 11,000 people for not wearing masks in public, and 6,500 for spitting. Wearing a mask in public places has been compulsory in Goa since April 27.

Goa police has also registered around 40,000 violations since lockdown began. This includes 1,335 arrests — 554 in North Goa and 781 in South Goa. Also, 738 FIRs have been registered pertaining to lockdown violations. Police patrolling has been intensified across the state.

A government order issued last month had said that violators would be fined Rs 100 for non-compliance. Additionally, those refusing to pay are liable to be prosecuted under Section 188 IPC, which involves six months imprisonment and a fine of Rs 1,000, or both.

The government had said that face covers, which include masks, are available with chemists, and homemade masks can also be used and reused after proper washing and disinfecting.

The government order had states that face covers must be used in all public places and work places — including streets, hospitals and at working sites. Meanwhile, after confidential lab reports about Covid-19 were circulated on social media, IGP Jaspal Singh cautioned the public against sharing such information, failing which they would face action. He also said that for any verification of authenticity, citizens should call the 112 helpline.

Over six lakh migrants have arrived in the state jobless can fill the vacuum of workforce created by the departure of outbound migrants. It will help the industries and manufacturing units to get the much needed workforce.

The decision came during a review meeting with the labour department by the CM. The CM has also announced to create online labour exchange platform for migrant workers returning to the state. “The online platform will help in mapping these labourers. As per their skill set they will be absorbed into sectors in the state,” said the release from the CMO.

“These workers should be given training on different skill sets which are required by our units so that they can get employment and industries get a workforce to start production,” said the release.

The department of labour has informed the CM that they have provided skill training to around four lakh people in the last few years with different skills . The database of these skilled people has been provided to the industries and the health department to offer them jobs in their sectors.

Gehlot during a meeting also hinted about a change in labour laws to suit the changing scenario in the pandemic era. Instructions have been given to work on the reforms in the labour laws in the state.

Also, in a significant move, the government has approved the formation of Non-Resident Rajasthani Workforce Welfare Fund to provide assistance to state’s workers residing in other states. The fund was announced in the state budget.

176,['17/05/2020'],Gujarat high court tells lawyers to use real names,"Gujarat high court

AHMEDABAD: The Gujarat high court has gotten confused by the online identities of many lawyers and has asked them to change their usernames on Zoom to their real names, so that their real identity is displayed on the screen when they request the HC to allow entry into the virtual courtroom.

As the high court is hearing cases during the lockdown period through video conferencing on Zoom, its administration finds it a real challenge to allow people with ‘abstract display names’ or mostly ‘Admin’ to be part of the case hearing. Confused by these online identities, the HC has requested lawyers to see that when they call their actual, correct full name is displayed on screen when joining the court session on Zoom.

The chief justice directed the HC’s registrar general to not allow any lawyer without correct identity – the actual full name – inside the virtual courtroom. The registrar general has issued a circular saying, “If the display name of a participant to join VC hearing session does not display full proper name of the advocate, such advocate will not be allowed entry in the VC hearing session.”

Before issuing this warning, the HC requested all lawyers to identify themselves by their real full names by changing their usernames. “Many advocates do not have their actual correct full name as display name on the screen while joining the sessions. Many a times, the name displayed is either some username or just the first name without surname, or ‘Admin’ or some abstract display name which might have been used for joining Zoom sessions for some other purpose from the same device. This creates hardship for both the court as well as the advocates, as it becomes difficult to identify who is intending to join the video conferencing hearing session,” the HC circular reads.

177,['17/05/2020'],Rains likely to hit Goa by June 10 after late landfall at Kerala,"Panaji: Be prepared to bear up with the summer heat for a bit longer this year. Officials at the India Meteorological Department ( IMD ), Panaji said that the onset of southwest monsoon in Goa is likely to be delayed by a few days with arrival now pegged at June 10.

On Friday, IMD Pune announced that the monsoon, which normally hits the Kerala coast by June 1, will be delayed till June 5.

The southwest monsoon generally arrives in Goa within a week after it hits Kerala. Weather experts say the monsoon currents arrive as pulses each time and proceed further into the Indian landmass. The arrival of monsoon is therefore based on the strength of the current.

“Considering data from 1961 to 2019, June 5 is the arrival date for the Goan coast. This means that it takes about five days for the monsoon currents to cover the distance from the south Kerala coast to Goa. Based on this, we presume that this year, the monsoon will reach Goa around June 10,” IMD Goa scientist, Rahul M, said.

He said the northward progression of the monsoon, after it hits Kerala, is monitored based on by parameters such as rainfall, wind direction, height up to which westerly winds are observed and water vapour content over a region observed via satellite imageries. Only when these features are set as per the criteria, the arrival of the southwest monsoon can be declared.

On April 15, when IMD released new reference dates for arrival and withdrawal of the southwest monsoon in the country, the normal onset date for Goa remained unchanged, this despite the state having received rain nearly two weeks late in 2019.

In 2019, the state witnessed one of the most delayed onset of monsoon in over three decades, after it arrived on June 20. Prior to that, the most delayed onset of monsoon was observed in 1983, when it also arrived on June 20.

However, the withdrawal date for the state has been delayed by four days to October 14 as against the original October 10. In 2019, the official monsoon withrawal date was October 16. About a week later, the state was hit by the cyclonic storm Kyarr resulting in a few more days of intense rainfall.

The normal monsoon onset dates have been revised based on data from 1961 to 2019 and the normal withdrawal dates based on data from 1971 to 2019. The IMD Pune has now released a detailed report which lists Goa’s onset date as June 5 and withdrawal date as October 14.

The guidelines were prepared by a team headed by ADGP (training) B Sandhya and ADGP (administration) Manoj Abraham.All the units and offices have been instructed that only 50% of manpower of each unit will be on duty on a given day, and arrests and remands should be avoided in minor and bailable cases.In the case of arrests, the accused should be asked to wear mask and glove, and should be made to sit one metre away from police officers in the vehicle. In lock-ups and interrogation rooms, social distancing needs to be maintainedPolice have been asked not to conduct routine checking for document verification, and even if a vehicle has to be intercepted, the officer should maintain a safe distance from the vehicle. A vehicle, if confiscated, should be disinfected before taking it to the station.The mediation and talks between police and petitioners and the opposite party in a case, would be through online platform, or video conferencing. Also, the document transfer by petitioners will hereafter be through email or WhatsApp to avoid direct contact between police and petitioner.Even if a person needs to be summoned to station, safety measures should be taken, and the matter should be disposed soon without making the person to wait for long.One of the biggest challenges faced by the police is regarding protests and riot control. In such cases, they have been asked to wear masks and gloves in addition to riot gear, and use maximum barricades to avoid physical contacts with the protestors. The protestors should be warned in advance about the Covid-19 spread in a crowd, and arresting of protestors should not be a routine exercise as in normal circumstances.“If arrests are to be made, violent mobsters should be separately targeted, overpowered, and arrested by a separate squad of police officials who should wear a fully covered PPE,” the guidelines say.",thiruvananthapuram,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-75783484,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-56469,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/post-covid-19-contactless-policing-likely-to-be-norm/articleshow/75781198.cms

BHOPAL: In a step towards systematic surveillance for SARS-CoV-2 infection in all districts and increase routine testing as per current testing guidelines, the MP health department is to procure more RNA extraction machines from a South Korean manufacturer, according to sources.

Around 16 such machines are to be supplied by the manufacturer. Two more RNA extraction facilities would be increased with the help of the Aziz Premji Foundation this month, said sources. So far, MP has 17 laboratories which are testing for Covid-19. Around 3,500 Covid-19 tests can take place in Madhya Pradesh each day, according to the Directorate of Medical Education (DME), which monitors the testing facility in these labs.

The testing machines would be automated and can be pre-programmed.

Another set of measures is to improve testing at the district level. It can be done with TB testing facilities with high-end machines like CBNAAT.

Also, cartridge-based nucleic acid amplification test (CBNAAT) was introduced in the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) based method for detection of TB. It also detects rifampicin resistance as it targets the rpoB gene of mycobacteria. PCR testing also determines Covid-19 presence in swab samples.

There are also some alternatives such as the TrueNat test, which is cheaper as it has been developed in India. Guidelines for the same are expected to be released soon, according to an AIIMS official.

181,['17/05/2020'],"After armed police outpost near border, Nepalese Army officials visit area","Pithoragarh: Two days after an armed police outpost was set up by the Nepalese government near Kalapani at Chhangru, around 18 km from the Lipulekh Pass, a visit by Nepalese Army officials was reported in the area.

Sources confirmed to TOI that a team of Nepalese Army personnel including a senior official visited Darchula, which borders Indian territory on Saturday, but added that they were not aware about the purpose of the visit or about any activity undertaken by the personnel there.

Meanwhile, Pithoragarh’s district magistrate Vijay Kumar Jogdande told TOI, “We have found out that no construction activity has yet been started at Chhangru but a team of armed police personnel has been deployed there by the Nepalese government.”

Notably, Chhangru is the last Nepalese village before the border.

The increased activity by the Nepalese government near the border with Pithoragarh comes days after defence minister Rajnath Singh inaugurated an almost 80-kilometre link-road near Lipulekh Pass. During the inauguration on May 8, Singh had said that the Tawaghat-Lipulekh road would cut travel time to Kailash Mansarovar significantly.

Reacting to the development, Kathmandu had expressed “regret” over India’s “unilateral” decision of constructing the road. The Lipulekh Pass is marked by the Kalapani river, one of the headwaters of the Kali River in the Kumaon Himalayas at an altitude of 3,600–5,200 meters and is claimed by the Nepalese as their territory. The Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) in New Delhi has reiterated that the area lies “well within the Indian territory.”

task force

The prolonged lockdown has helped reduce the spread of coronavirus and mortality due to it, but it has also brought all economic activities to a grinding halt. Stark economic consequences coupled with a grim realization that this new normal is no longer sustainable will force the government to allow a phased reopening of business activities. New hotspots of infection are mainly in the urban areas which are also hotspots of economic activities. Absence of a proven anti-viral drug and the non-availability of a potent vaccine in the near future means we are very much on the defensive against the virus. The only scenario that emerges is one in which the common man has to learn to co-exist with the virus, unhurt and strong.The lockdown is equivalent of a crash diet, effective but not sustainable. Crash diets inevitably fail because they are not accompanied by a sustainable change in daily dietary patterns. Once the diet ends, we go back to digging into our chocolate cakes, pastries and gulab jamuns, instantaneously undoing all the gains we made over the past month. This is more true for the fight against corona. Unless we incorporate healthy living habits, basic tenets of social distancing , hand hygiene and use of masks in our daily routine, the hardships endured during the lockdown would have been in vain.Doctors protect themselves from infected patients while performing their duty. Similarly, teachers are responsible for the physical and mental safety of students. Security personnel are expected to enforce law and order to prevent lawlessness. This overt reliance on certain small sections of the society to keep the majority safe and under check is grossly inadequate in the current scenario. TV screens were recently filled with images of humungous crowds of migrant labourers at railway terminals and serpentine queues outside liquor stores. It was left to the local administration to vainly enforce social distancing between warring individuals. Self-preservation is the strongest and most primitive of all human instincts — a will to survive, at any cost. Historically, that has meant putting selfish interests over the general good of the species. In the past few months, we have learnt that it is easier and more meaningful not to infect others than to merely protect oneself from getting infected.We need to change our mindset. We have to act as if we have the virus and we have a mandate to protect others. We have to understand our social responsibility , an unwritten law that we have to take all precautions of observing cough etiquette, wearing masks and maintaining social distancing to protect others from getting infected. In doing so, we will achieve all we want for ourselves.We, as a society, must realise that our selfish interests of protecting ourselves can only be achieved if we work as a collective group and not as individuals. We would be wise to follow the wisdom of our Shastras — “Paramarth hi param swarth hai”. As more and more individuals undertake and share this collective responsibility and understand that it is only through protecting others that they themselves can be safe, we may reach a tipping point in our fight against corona.Our first step should be make the means available to the general public to fight this virus through universal distribution of three-layered masks. Home masks may be equally good but should be validated by scientific bodies before these are recommended for wider use. The Covid warriors who are putting service before self should be supplied with N-95 masks regularly. Vending machines could be installed for providing masks at most economical rates as well as for their disposal.We have to graduate from the concept of social distancing to the more effective one of social responsibility. Of course, for non-abiding citizens, we will need enforcement and penalties, like confinement at house for 14 days.We must pledge that the basic tenets of social distancing, hand hygiene and universal adoption of masks are followed in their true spirit and not as a form of punishment inflicted by an authority. We should not require the presence of a police officer to pull our masks over our faces or to move back three paces from the person standing next in line.Patients coming to health care facilities should take the onus and make a conscious effort not to infect unsuspecting contacts and healthcare workers. Data suggests that youngsters are often asymptomatic and may become super spreaders. They can transmit the virus mainly because of their lifestyles and rapid mobility. It is time that we mentor the young.We must be the change to bring about a change. It is only through protection of the community at large that the individual will become safe.",delhi,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-75783865,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-254549,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/lets-act-as-if-we-have-the-virus-and-a-mandate-to-protect-others/articleshow/75783192.cms

The driver failed to see the ditch in the darkness, sources said.Passengers, most of whom are students and working professionals, said that the journey was jinxed right from the very onset, turning the ideally 12-hour trip into an over 30-hour ordeal involving two buses.The journey began with a an unpleasant, almost 8-hour-long wait for the bus, in the scorching summer heat at the Kempegowda bus station in Bengaluru , followed by a health scare as there was no screening of passengers for Covid-19 symptoms or even temperature, before boarding. The passengers were originally asked to report at the terminus at 8am on Thursday, but the bus was held up at the Tamil Nadu-Karnataka border for hours, as the authorities were verifying approvals.“There were two nuns and two senior citizens from Goa among us,” the passenger said, adding that they waited in the heat, surviving on biscuits and fruits.The bus arrived by late afternoon and it was only at 4.30pm that it left for Goa. “We were not screened by the bus staff before boarding the vehicle nor were we told to maintain social distancing. Some passengers even sat next to one another during the journey due to limited seats,” he said.After a long day’s wait, when the passengers drifted to sleep, the accident occurred. And then, the shaken lot had to camp on the side of the road all night, in the middle of nowhere, waiting for assistance. Sources said that the highway patrol vehicle arrived first and the ambulance followed soon after and took the young woman who sustained a head injury to hospital. Police arrived only around 7am. They were then informed that they would have to wait for a KTC bus, which was headed to Gadag to drop migrants stranded in Goa.The passengers then decided to walk in serach of help, and found a petrol station a kilometre away, where they could buy water. For the second consecutive day, they waited in the heat, for a relief bus, that finally arrived at 2 pm. “It was not an AC bus, but was much more spacious allowing us to maintain social distancing,” the passenger said.

On September 10, 2019, the NHRC had directed the chief secretary to take action on a long-pending demand for a high court bench in the Koraput region, within eight weeks, on the basis of a complaint filed by Jeypore-based rights activist and advocate Anup Kumar Patro. Six months later, he received a letter from the home department, which led him to file a fresh complaint.

In the letter, dated March 19, a deputy secretary said, “I am directed to say that the question of taking a decision in respect of the feasibility and desirability of a place for establishment of a permanent bench of the high court comes within the purview of the Union government. The state has been pursuing the matter with the Union government but the latter has not taken a definite decision.”

Patro’s complaint contends that the people of Koraput region, mostly tribal, poor and illiterate, are deprived of access to justice due to distance from the high court bench in Cuttack. The region, since its bifurcation over two decades ago, constitutes Koraput, Malkangiri, Rayagada and Nabarangpur districts.

The high court is located 647 km from Malkangiri, 550 km from Koraput, 512 km from Nabarangpur and 431 km from Rayagada. While the minimum time to travel to Cuttack by road from these places is 12 hours, the cost is as high as Rs 800 on one side.

187,['17/05/2020'],Officials of 3 states coordinate pregnant woman’s passage to village,"Woman and her child were picked up from Agra and taken safely to their home in Dholpur district in Rajasthan

AHMEDABAD: There was an example of sensitivity displayed by administrative officials of three states as an eight-months-pregnant woman, based in Ahmedabad , was reunited with her family in Rajasthan. Ahmedabad district administration officials got the woman aboard a Shramik Special train bound for Agra in UP on Friday night. Officials of Dholpur district in Rajasthan got an ambulance ready at Agra station, which took her Badagam, her village in Dholpur district on Saturday.

Priti Kushwah’s husband, Pintu Kushwah, and brother-in-law had left for Rajasthan to drop off their mother just before the lockdown. She was left alone at her house in the Khodiyarnagar area of Nikol, as her husband was unable to return to Ahmedabad due to the lockdown.

Even as Ahmedabad district collectorate officials were making plans to send the woman and her two-year-old child by a special ambulance to the Rajasthan border, they got in touch with the Dholpur district administration. “We coordinated with the Rajasthan officials as well as with the Agra administration about this case. Arrangements were made for her transportation from Agra to Dholpur,” district collector K K Nirala said.

Dholpur district collector R K Jaiswal said the officials were constantly in touch with Priti, and told her to switch off her phone at night to conserve battery power for the morning.

“We had an ambulance posted at Agra with special permission. A team of doctors and the woman’s brother-in-law accompanied her back to Dholpur. We provided them ration kits and dropped them off at her village.”

Collectorate officials said Amit Dhaka, special secretary to Rajasthan CM Ashok Gehlot, played a crucial role in ensuring the safe passage for the woman. “When we contacted him, he made immediate arrangements to ensure that the woman and her child were picked up from Agra and taken safely to their home in Dholpur district,” said a collectorate official.

188,['17/05/2020'],Karnataka: Health department carries out ‘surgical’ strike on Dakshina Kannada over cluster outbreak,"File photo used for representational purpose

MANGALURU: Did state health department carry out ‘surgical’ strike on the district health authorities? It seems so, if varying accounts on the probe that the state government had ordered on First Neuro Hospital , supervised isolation centre located in Padil, are anything to go by.

While the district administration on Friday maintained that the team is yet to come, the authority that constituted the team said the report has been submitted. The government has ordered the probe with regard to the identification of P-0 at this cluster outbreak.

The health department had directed Dr S Sacchidanand, vice-chancellor of Bengaluru-based Rajiv Gandhi University of Health Sciences (RGUHS) to set up a team to probe the turn of events at the hospital. The two-member team, set up by Dr Sacchidanand, visited the hospital and submitted its report to the government. “The team comprised two doctors from a local medical college,” Dr Sacchidanand told STOI.

Not going into the contents of the report or the committee’s brief, Dr Sacchidanand said that he had merely followed the directions given by the government. “It is for the government to comment and act on the report,” he said. The team’s visit was also not known to local elected representatives, including Mangaluru City North MLA Y Bharath Shetty. The legislator said he only knew about the team being asked to probe the hospital.

District health and family welfare officer Dr Ramachandra Bairy told STOI that he came to know about the RGUHS probe team through a WhatsApp forward on May 12, the day the health authorities were busy with handling the first flight under Vande Bharat Mission at Mangaluru International Airport. “I have no knowledge about their visit or their report,” he said, adding they would have presented all details that they had collected as part of their own probe had the team sought them.

DC Sindhu B Rupesh, who confirmed the probe by a team under RGUHS at a press briefing on Friday, said the administration was not kept in the loop about the team’s visit nor was it aware about the team submitting the report to the government.

In its interim report, a six-member expert committee led by Dr Bairy had sought time to examine reports of patients from Kerala who had undergone treatment there. “We have sent a request letter to the health department to seek concurrence of their counterparts in Kerala. Once that is approved, the committee will work its way towards identifying P-0 as far as First Neuro Hospital is concerned,” he added.

192,['17/05/2020'],"From direct sales to overcrowding, liquor vendors still violating norms","Nagpur: Several liquor shop owners in city were found furtively selling to customers without checking permits on Saturday, the second day of liquor sale.

Following heavy crowding at many shops in the outskirts of city, collector Ravindra Thakare permitted only home delivery of liquor permissible in entire police commissionerate. At this, police also withdrew their deployment from liquor shops paving the way for illegal activities.

It is learnt two flying squads of the state excise department were pressed into action but they took no action despite blatant violations throughout the day.

Keeping shutters down, some shop owners were found supplying liquor directly to customers from a concealed place in the vicinity instead of delivering at home. This led to crowding at many places violating Covid distancing norms.

Collector Thakare said he would ask officials to be vigilant. Joint CP Ravindra Kadam also said there would be strict action now on the errant shop owners and customers.

Apart from rampant violation of the instructions issued by the collector regarding home delivery of liquor, there was none to even control the crowds outside the liquor shops.

SP, state excise Pramod Sonone, said he would cancel the licence of liquor shops if they were caught engaging in violations. “We have issued 150 licences to home deliver liquor which is highest in the state,” he said.

TOI also witnessed several shop owners selling through their delivery boys. At Indora, there was substantial crowding outside a beer shoppee with cops standing less than 100 metres away. The beer shoppe owner would lift the shutter to make deliveries after directly accepting cash from customers.

Many customers were also found outside the shoppe without masks.

In north Nagpur, a liquor shop owner was seen taking orders from customers. He would walk back into a lane beside the shop and bring the customer their choice of the liquor.

Another shop owner at Pachpaoli was found supplying bottles to his customers from a place in the adjacent lane. A constable was also present outside the shop when several customers visited for making clandestine purchases.

One passenger sustained a minor head injury, while others, including the driver and conductor, had a lucky escape.“We were sleeping when the accident occured. I woke up to people screaming, and found myself lying on top of another passenger,” one traveller on the bus told TOI after arriving in the state in the early hours of Saturday.Sources on the bus said that in a bid to avoid a speeding vehicle that was coming head-on on a one-way stretch, the driver was forced to swerve sharply to the right, which is when the vehicle slipped into a ditch and overturned. The driver failed to see the ditch in the darkness, sources said.Passengers, most of whom are students and working professionals, said that the journey was jinxed right from the very onset, turning the ideally 12-hour trip into an over 30-hour ordeal involving two buses.The journey began with a an unpleasant, almost 8-hour-long wait for the bus, in the scorching summer heat at the Kempegowda bus station in Bengaluru , followed by a health scare as there was no screening of passengers for Covid-19 symptoms or even temperature, before boarding. The passengers were originally asked to report at the terminus at 8am on Thursday, but the bus was held up at the Tamil Nadu-Karnataka border for hours, as the authorities were verifying approvals.“There were two nuns and two senior citizens from Goa among us,” the passenger said, adding that they waited in the heat, surviving on biscuits and fruits.The bus arrived by late afternoon and it was only at 4.30pm that it left for Goa. “We were not screened by the bus staff before boarding the vehicle nor were we told to maintain social distancing. Some passengers even sat next to one another during the journey due to limited seats,” he said.After a long day’s wait, when the passengers drifted to sleep, the accident occurred. And then, the shaken lot had to camp on the side of the road all night, in the middle of nowhere, waiting for assistance. Sources said that the highway patrol vehicle arrived first and the ambulance followed soon after and took the young woman who sustained a head injury to hospital. Police arrived only around 7am. They were then informed that they would have to wait for a KTC bus, which was headed to Gadag to drop migrants stranded in Goa.The passengers then decided to walk in serach of help, and found a petrol station a kilometre away, where they could buy water. For the second consecutive day, they waited in the heat, for a relief bus, that finally arrived at 2 pm. “It was not an AC bus, but was much more spacious allowing us to maintain social distancing,” the passenger said.

They had arrived at the border check post by 8pm.They were then taken to a hospital in South Goa for testing at 1am on Saturday, and thereon to the quarantine centre at Margao Residency.“The centre was willing to take only eight people, so we decided to move to another centre,” he said.The passengers were then taken to a quarantine centre at Colva Residency in the same KTC bus, and finally reached by 5am.",goa,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-47529300,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-110164,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/amidst-already-hellish-journey-relief-bus-bound-for-goa-overturns-at-gadag/articleshow/75783196.cms

COLVA: Huge amounts of garbage lie strewn along the Colva-Benaulim beach stretch, left uncleared by the beach cleaning agency for over a month now. On April 10, TOI had reported that the garbage deposited by the sea was not cleared from the beach.

Later, the Karnataka Commercial and Industrial Corporation (KCIC), which is contracted by the government to maintain the cleanliness of the beach, collected the garbage off the shore, but dumped the waste in piles amongst the shrubbery at the foot of the sand dunes along the same stretch.

Tourism director Menino D’Souza had then said that the garbage collected was kept for drying and it would be segregated into plastic and other waste and then would be transferred to the garbage treatment plant. He also had said that tree branches and wood would be stacked there, as it is not accepted by the plant.When contacted, D’Souza said he is unaware of the garbage not being cleared .

The government had engaged Karnataka Commercial and Industrial Corporation (KCIC) to collect wet waste from shacks from Arossim to Cavelossim and maintain cleanliness on the beach.

Presently, there are no shacks operating along the beach stretch, so there is no generation of garbage, yet the agency has failed to keep the beach clean, said a shack owner, whose has not dismantled his shack yet, as it houses his employees.

Migrant workers who have returned to their native places comprise the second largest cluster of infections confirmed in the past 48 hours.

While 24 of the inmates have been admitted to SMS Hospital because of age or co-morbidities, the rest are being monitored at a treatment facility set up on the jail premises. A senior jail official who tested positive on Saturday has been hospitalised, too.

Much to the relief of health officials, none of the samples collected from the larger Jaipur central jail next door, which has 1,172 inmates, came out positive for the virus.

“When the first case was reported in the district jail on May 11, we started mass screening and testing of all staff and inmates. With a treatment centre on the jail premises itself, we are hopeful of containing further spread of the virus,” said chief medical health officer (Jaipur-I) Narottam Sharma, who has been camping at the prison with his team for two days now.

The district jail currently houses 423 prisoners, of whom a few are recent entrants. One of the first two inmates to test positive for Covid-19 is from Jamwarangarh in Jaipur district and had been brought to the jail on April 13.

The other inmate to test positive along with him had been arrested by Bajaj Nagar police on May 9 and put in a cell with 18 other prisoners on May 10. He was diagnosed with Covid-19 the very next day.

Of the 18 who had shared the cell with him, two have tested positive.

As per guidelines issued by ministry of railways, empty rakes were sanitised following the standard protocols. Six Railway Protection Force personnel will be escorting each train. IRCTC has made arrangements for supplying food and water to passengers of these trains.

Senior officials of the Mysuru division of South Western Railway were present both at Ashokapuram (Mysuru) and Kabakaputtur. Mysuru deputy commissioner Abhiram G Sankar and superintendent of police CB Ryshyanth were also present during the departure at Ashokapuram.

The migrant workers were first brought to Bannimantap Torchlight Parade Grounds from various parts of Mysuru district on special buses before their departure to Ashokapuram railway station.

Officials collected their address, end-to-end destination and other details. “They were taken to the railway station in buses after having their medical check-up, collecting their address, end-to-end destination details. Only medically fit persons were allowed to board train and food packets were also distributed by the state government to the migrants,” said assistant director of labour Thammanna.

Earlier this week, a Shramik Special left Kabakaputtur for Bapudham Motihari in Bihar, taking the total number of such trains originating from Mysuru division to three, Priya Shetty, divisional commercial manager and PRO, said.

202,['17/05/2020'],Gujarat: Academic sessions in schools by June-end,"Representative image

GANDHINAGAR: The government of Gujarat has initiated discussions with school managements of the state to begin the academic year by June end with stringent social distancing and hygiene measures in place. However, the government is yet to open a dialogue with parents’ bodies.

A key source in the state education department confirmed that discussions have begun between the government, GCERT, teacher’s bodies and school authorities on when the academic year in schools can be initiated. “We have proposed the idea of running schools in two shifts to ensure social distancing, running schools on an odd-even pattern, making masks compulsory, changes in the syllabus, regular sanitization of schools and even holding online sessions to whatever extent possible,” sources in the government said.

“We are beginning to gather feedbacks and suggestions from school managements on the possible measures that can be adopted so that schools can begin functioning even while the safety of students is maintained at all costs. The government will take a decision on this issue in the next few days,” the sources said.

Archit Bhatt, president, Ahmedabad Progressive School Management Association however said that the government has still not consulted the body.

“Our CBSE school members have begun online courses from April itself and these will continue so that education of the students does not get compromised. Under normal circumstances, schools start from June 8, but since vacations in colleges has been extended, we expect extension in school vacations as well,” said Bhatt.

Schools are of the opinion that maintaining social distancing might turn out to be a very challenging task in schools. “Classrooms in most schools are small and maintaining social distancing might be difficult to implement. Moreover, measuring temperatures of students on a daily basis will be very challenging. Sanitizing the entire school premises on a daily basis is not an affordable option,” Bhatt said.

Schools feel that all these issues need to be discussed in detail before any directions are issued by the government. “As far as syllabus is concerned, the CBSE decides it. However, the government needs to have wider consultations with all stakeholders before finalizing anything,” Bhatt said.

Bhaskar Patel, president, Gujarat state school management association said that earlier, a class had 45 students, which has increased to around 65 now. “Cost of doubling shifts for social distancing, using masks, sanitization of schools and all such measures have major impact on fee structure. The government needs to clear all these issues and even announce support measures to schools,” he said.

He finally managed to take his father, Yesudas (54), to Sassoon General Hospital in a vegetable delivery pickup van with the help of constable Deepak Tate from the Samarth police station. But doctors declared Yesudas dead on arrival around 4.15am on Friday.Yesudas was a heart patient. After he complained of chest pain, Max with the help from neighbours, made him sit in a chair and brought him to the road so that they could take an autorickshaw to the hospital. Unfortunately, Francis being overweight, could not get into the autorickshaw.Max immediately called the 108 ambulance service but could not get through. His call to police yielded response and constable Tate reached the spot in 10 minutes, Even Tate’s calls to the 108 and other ambulance services did not yield any positive response. Many private ambulance service providers asked if the patient had a medical certificate to prove that he was not a Covid-19 patient.Pune municipal commissioner Shekhar Gaikwad told TOI that he had ordered a probe into the incident and sought an explanation from the “108 ambulance service” provider.Baramati MP Supriya Sule said in a message on a social media group, “This was a ghastly story. I have spoken to the administration and taken it up.”Max said, “How can the ambulances not come at a time of emergency? Everybody tried calling the ambulance, but either we could not get through, or when we did, the service providers said it would take an hour to reach our place or just refused to come citing that they did not know if my father was infected with coronavirus . The KEM Hospital is nearby and Sassoon is just 10 minutes away from my home. Yet, I lost my father just because ambulances refused to come.”Constable Tate had reached the spot by 12.30am on Friday after he received a call from the police control room while he was doing the rounds. “Apart from calling the ambulance service providers, we tried hailing three-four ambulances plying on the road. While a couple of their drivers said they were on way to pick up a patient, the others refused help citing that they did not know if the patient was coronavirus positive. Finally, we saw the pickup van around 4am on Friday,” said Tate.Social activist Sudhir Dhawale, present at the spot right from the beginning, said, “The driver of the pickup van going to Market Yard from Nigdi finally stopped. The moment we told him what the problem was, he agreed to help. All the systems have collapsed in the containment zones. The barricades are one of the reasons for many ambulances not coming in and the other factor is coronavirus fear.”Azhar Sayyed, a neighbour of Max, said Yesudas was not the only person in the area to have died because of delay in reaching the hospital on Friday. He said, “The entire area is barricaded and there is no space even for an ambulance to ply. One of my neighbours, around 50-year-old, felt chest pain around 1am on Friday. We took her to the hospital in an autorickshaw. KEM Hospital is just half-a-kilometre away from our place and it usually only just five minutes to reach there. But it took us 15 minutes to reach the hospital on Friday because of the barricades. She was dead by then.”Sayyed had posted the video of Francis’ death online.

PANAJI: Taxi operators in the state have given a representation to the transport department demanding Rs 12,000 as monthly allowance till their businesses run at pre-lockdown status. The operators said that they have bank installments to pay but don’t have any business due to the lockdown.

“Taxis receive maximum business from hotels and tourism in Goa. How can we resume operations if the hospitality industry is not active?” said Laxman Korgaonkar of the North Goa Tourist Taxi Owners’ Association.

The association has also demanded relief in road tax, passenger tax, renewal of vehicle permit, renewal of authorisations, renewal of driving licence, fitness certificate, PUC certificate, among others.

“Unless tourism resumes, we will not be able to stand on our feet again which is why we require relaxation on these taxes. Locals do not rely on taxis on a daily basis,” Sanjay Vengurlekar, executive member of the association said.

205,['17/05/2020'],"Removing stock limit is better for farmers, consumers: Experts","JAIPUR: Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman’s proposal to deregulate pricing and stock limit of agriculture produce and opening the market for retailers, traders and processors is a pragmatic step which aligns with many of the decisions recently taken in Rajasthan.

Many of the sectoral experts that TOI spoke to said liberalising the market from the clutches of cartels operating in mandis will help farmers get better price for their produce and the scope for monopoly in the current environment is not a potential threat.

Ramesh Mittal, senior director at National Institute of Agriculture Marketing under the ministry of agriculture said, “Removing the stock limits will allow farmers discover better price for their produce. In the existing policy regime, even if the farmer has more produce and wants to sell, the wholesaler cannot buy after a limit even if he desires so. This leaves the farmer no option but to sell at distress rates as he keeps on approaching buyers.”

Mittal said currently there are not many buyers as food processing units are closed and arranging logistics for transportation is not easy.

While some raised the issue of rising monopoly, a government official said the expansion of storage infrastructure has increased vastly over the past few years. “The private sector has built huge storage capacity. What used to be an advantage for them is now available to everybody. There could be some retail hoarding but they cannot have the capacity to influence the pricing. In addition, the electronic trading of farm produce is gaining strong ground, especially in Rajasthan,” said the official preferring anonymity.

The finance minister also said the Centre would bring in reforms for marketing of agriculture produce to give more choices to farmers to sell. Today, mandis operate through members and cartelization is deep-rooted.

“Reforms have been taking place like the introduction of electronic trading portal, National Agriculture Market (eNAM). But the membership structure in mandi committees, which allows cartelisation should go. Mandis should be liberalised which will benefit farmers and consumers,” said Pradeep Mehta, secretary general of CUTS International.

The state government has amended the Agricultural Produce Marketing Committee Act. Now the food processing units or the bulk users do not need to buy from mandis and can directly purchase from the farmers. But they need to get licences from the state government.

There are around 1,900 buyers who have been given licences by the state governments. But the Centre’s reforms, details of which are yet to be announced, may go one step further by not making it necessary to have licences.

Agriculture is a state subject but trade and commerce of the produce across the country can allow the Centre to prescribe broad guidelines that the states can legislate.

Rajasthan has been the first state to introduce eNAM trading platforms in all its 144 mandis. It also has allowed private warehouses to operate as mandis. To lure them, the state recently exempted them the Rs 15 lakh fees and the criteria of 40 bigha land.

“We wanted to give the farmers more choices to get better prices and that’s why gave incentives to private warehouses to operate as mandis,” said the government official.

The online admission process is expected to benefit students as it will do away with the need of visiting colleges to obtain application forms and submitting the same. Students will be able to apply to as many colleges as they wish to.

The higher education council has directed universities to obtain information with regard to affiliated colleges in order to pave way for online admissions. Council chairman Prof K Hemachandra Reddy said that there are around 2 lakh seats in 1,500 colleges in the state.

“The undergraduate admissions will be conducted online from the next academic session. There is also a proposal to implement the same for postgraduate courses from the 2021-22 academic year,” Reddy said. The chairman further appealed to students to follow all Covid-related precautions and practice social distancing.

“This will help reduce the risk of contamination, cut down the chain of transmission and bring down the chances of the rapid spread of the novel coronavirus,” said Prof Reddy.

Meanwhile, the council has deferred processing of proposals for sanctioning new or additional undergraduate and postgraduate courses including change in media of instruction, conversions and withdrawals of courses.

The higher education council has made it clear that its focus right now is to conduct the required examinations and subsequently the evaluation processes once the lockdown in lifted.

The council is working on a skill-based curriculum and an online admission process to be implemented from the 2020-21 academic year.

It was viewed that processing applications, inspections and rectification of deficiencies may not be possible before the commencement of the new academic year due to the lack of time, the on-going lockdown situation, the threat of Covid spread, etc. The proposals are likely to be considered for the next academic year 2021-22, the council said.

211,['17/05/2020'],Online wedlock for Rajasthan groom in coronavirus hotspot and bride in Maharashtra,"UDAIPUR: Coronavirus lockdowns and travel restrictions have forced people around the world to delay their nuptials but this couple from two states, 650 kilometers away from each other, were too ‘desperate’ to get married that they took the virtual way.

Saurav Jain, the groom from Adarsh Colony in Nimbahera town of Chittorgarh and bride Shraddha Kothari, daughter of Heeralal Kothari from Aurangabad in Maharashtra, entered into wedlock through live streaming on Friday. A pandit in Aurangabad read aloud the mantra from his home, while the bride and groom, in their respective homes with parents and close relatives, connected through video conferencing and performed the marriage rituals. A day before wedding, other programmes like Ganapati sthapana, mehndi, haldi and ladies sangeet too were performed the same way.

“Ours is a love marriage and we were engaged in November last year. We have been in a relationship for 6-7 years and inspite of being from the same caste, Shraddha’s family was a bit hesitant in accepting our union because of the distance between our cities, they wanted her to settle in Maharashtra only,” Saurav told TOI.

The couple managed to convince their families and the wedding was decided for May 15 at Nimbahera. The lockdown, however, played a spoilsport.

“We thought everything would be normal maybe within a month and hence did not cancel the bookings but as Nimbahera too turned into a corona hotspot, our families suggested to postpone the wedding,” Saurav said.

The couple feared that the delay in marriage could cause complications further if any of the elders in the family changed their mind and reconsidered the alliance. To avoid such a situation, Saurav suggested the online wedding idea, which was agreed to after initial reservations.

The families have accepted the virtual wedding as a real one. “The pandit solemnized the wedding as per the vedic rituals. Few things like jaimala, mangalsutra, sindoor bharai and saptapadi (pheras) would be performed later on in our reception which we plan to organise in Udaipur soon after the lockdown is lifted,” said Saurav.

The groom owns a production house and makes documentaries and short films, while the bride is an actress working in serials aired on Marathi channels. Saurav’s father Sushil Jain has pledged to donate a percentage of the amount, which he had planned to spend on the wedding, for social cause.

“As always, saving lives is our priority. We should put our best efforts to save every precious human life,” chief minister Naveen Patnaik said while reviewing the state’s preparedness in a video-conference with senior officials and collectors of the districts likely to be affected by the cyclone.

Quoting the IMD, chief minister Naveen Patnaik said the districts of Ganjam, Puri, Jagatsinghpur, Kendrapada, Bhadrak, Balasore, Mayurbhanj, Jajpur, Cuttack, Khurda, Nayagarh, Gajapati could be affected by strong wind and heavy rainfall. Government authorities anticipate the impact may be very severe in the districts of Balasore, Bhadrak, Jagatsinghpur and Kendrapda.

A statement from the chief minister’s office said preparations are on to accommodate 11 lakh people in 567 cyclone centres and 7000 other concrete buildings. Three teams of National Disaster Response Force (NDRF), 12 teams of Odisha Disaster Rapid Action Force (ODRAF) and 355 units of Odisha Fire Services personnel are being deployed to tackle the situation.

Chief secretary Asit Tripahy said standing crops in lakhs of hectares, particularly paddy ripe for harvesting, pulses, oil seeds, cashew, mango, coconut and vegetables are likely to be damaged in the heavy rainfall and wind that the cyclone is expected to bring.

An IMD Bhubaneswar bulletin issued at 5.30 pm said the depression over southeast Bay of Bengal and its neighbourhood is likely to intensify into a cyclonic storm during the next 12 hours. It is expected to turn into a severe cyclonic storm during the subsequent 24 hours and rapidly turn into a very severe cyclonic storm by Monday morning.

It is very likely to move north north-westward initially till Sunday and then re-curve north north-eastward across northwest Bay of Bengal towards West Bengal and adjoining Odisha coasts between Monday and Wednesday. The IMD said wind speed on the Odisha coast could be between 45 km to 55 km per hour (gushing up to 65kmph) on Tuesday and may increase to 75 km to 85 km per hour (gushing up to 95 kmph) on Wednesday.

The chief secretary said 403 cyclone shelters have already been identified in the areas likely to be affected. Around 105 such shelters are presently being used as temporary medical camps and quarantine centres for Covid-19 care.

“Covid test of those staying in these centres are being done expeditiously so that persons testing negative can be sent to home quarantine. As a contingency, alternative buildings have been identified for use as cyclone shelters, in case the need arises,” said Tripthay who has conveyed the developments to cabinet secretary Rajiv Gauba.

Meanwhile, following discussion with the Centre, the state has decided not to allow Shramik special trains to coastal Odisha between Tuesday and Thursday, an official said.

214,['17/05/2020'],"Allow markets, malls in safe zones to open: Madhya Pradesh traders","Picture used for representational purpose only

BHOPAL: Paralysed after almost two months of coronavirus-triggered lockdown , the industry, trade and service sector is restless ahead of the Lockdown-4.0 beginning May 18. There has been a growing demand to revive “earnestly” the businesses and markets to put the economy back on the track.

Business organisations have also recommended several steps to the government to revive the production in factories and reopen the shopping complexes, markets and malls. The business community is demanding to open the markets with an argument that if the trade of essential commodities and pharmaceutical sector could start, then other shops could also start as well.

The state unit of the Shopping Centres Association of India (SCAI) has also “requested” the government to revive the business of malls and shopping complexes.

While malls and markets wait for the government’s nod to restart their businesses, the industrial estates, many of which got the permission to operate units, face an all together different problem. The problem is contradictions in government orders.

Referring to the issues faced by the industrialists of Madhya Pradesh , president of the Confederation of MP for Industry, Service and Trade (COMPIST) Govind Goyal said, “On one hand, the government issues circulars — one after another — to open the industries, on the other hand district administrations deny. The government must chalk out strategy to revive the business as soon as possible as the unemployment will create an altogether different problem.”

A recent survey of Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FICCI) has also recommended “Smooth movement of raw material and finished goods; ensuring availability of trucks, drivers and loaders among others .”

It has also recommended “Approvals to mobilise workforce from non-containment zones of Red Zone cities like Bhopal , Indore to nearby notified industrial areas.”

FICCI said that 80% of industries come under Red and Orange zones defined for the Covid19 — 54.7% in red while 25.6% in orange zones.

President of the Federation of MP Chambers of Commerce and Industry Dr RS Goswami said, “Sincere efforts are required to start the industrial areas. The government should also renew the licences of all the industries for the next 10 years and the fees can be deducted from the subsidies given to the MSMEs”.

Gautam Bhandari, president of Pithampur Audhogik Kendra said, “The government orders to open the industrial areas are not implemented in letter and spirit. How would skilled workers, managers and supervisors move out of Indore, a red zone?”

More than 500 industries have got permission, but hardly 200 are working. “Even those units which are opened, they are opened for maintenance of machines and equipment,” he said.

“There are many demands from the government, but then you need someone to give a positive response. Even in the last meeting with the MSME department, we asked for waiving off the minimum and fixed heads of the power charges and defer the state GST for one year among others.”

There is a huge problem of labourers, looking at the crisis, many of them are demanding advance payment of three months of wages as one of the conditions to return from places in Madhya Pradesh.

The SCAI urged the government to consider the graded opening of shopping centres and malls in Madhya Pradesh, which are not situated in containment zones.

“The SCAI members drawing on their collective experience over the years, have devised state-of-the-art and comprehensive standard operating procedures (SOPs) that address each and every process and aspect of efficient and safe functioning of shopping centres and malls amidst such testing time,” the MP writes to the chief minister.

The SCAI also shared a summary of the SOPs to be followed in case the malls and shopping centres are permitted to start.

BHOPAL: With the start of Lockdown-4.0 from May 18, the colleges have also raised their demands. A delegation of representatives from engineering colleges met Governor Lalji Tandon and presented a memorandum to press for their demands.

Colleges said that the administrative staff of the colleges should be allowed to function. “All activists of the colleges are closed for past two months. It will take sometime to resume work, if we are asked to open the campus. Therefore, administrative staff should be allowed to work with at least 33% of total staff. It will help in opening the campus properly. Else, it will be a big problem in opening the campus,” said JN Chouksey, chairman of association of professional and technical institutes.

He said the state government should ensure that the scholarship amount of SC/ST and OBC students may kindly be released as early as possible. “Scholarship is credited to students’ accounts as Direct Beneficiary Transfer, it is requested that this time it may kindly be transferred to college account, so that colleges can pay salary of April and May,” said Chouksey.

He also urged that the technical university of Madhya Pradesh (RGPV, Bhopal) and Barkatullah University , Bhopal may kindly be advised not to take affiliation fee for the year 2020-21.

The association also demanded that discoms should not charge any fixed charges on electricity bills and only the actual unit consumption charges should be billed for the month of April, May and June 2020.

216,['17/05/2020'],"What’s in the online cart?Masks, sanitisers, gloves","New Delhi: What are the “new essentials” that the National Capital Region is ordering online? Apart from the the usual grocery items, masks, sanitisers, gloves and face shields topped the shopping list of people in March with such products becoming an integral part of their lives, according to e-commerce companies.

A spokesperson of Snapdeal said, “The NCR alone accounted for 22% of the masks sold across India. Gurgaon had the largest market share of 30%, Noida and Greater Noida 22%, Delhi and Ghaziabad 18% each and Faridabad 9%. The sale of masks has more than tripled in the last 30 days because of greater awareness, easy availability and reduced prices.”

“The sale of hand sanitisers went up by 60% in the last one month with 500ml and multi-pack bottles of 50-60ml being the most preferred. Just like masks, Gurgaon was the biggest market accounting for 40% of sanitiser sales in the NCR. Orders for personal protection equipment like face shields, shoe covers and goggles have also gone up,” the spokesperson added.

While non-essential items can’t be delivered in Delhi as it is a red zone, e-commerce companies have started taking orders for permitted items from neighbouring Gurgaon and Ghaziabad. Industry insiders revealed that a substantially high volume of Delhi customers searched for smartphones, laptops, headphones, laptops and phone chargers, books and stationery, among other non-essential products.

An Amazon India spokesperson said, “Sellers on our platform have received orders for smart devices, electronics, kitchen appliances, clothes, toys and games and other work and study from home products from customers in orange and green zones.”

“As we support the economic revival of small and medium businesses, we urge the government to allow an expanded list of priority products in red zones. This will not only serve urgent needs and spruce up economic activity, but also ensure safety of citizens in a high-risk area,” added the spokesperson.

Asked for comments, Flipkart said it didn’t have anything to share regarding online shopping trends at the moment.

The next on the most-searched list after masks, sanitisers and smart devices were personal grooming products such as trimmers, shavers and hair removal products, followed by weighing scales and blood pressure monitors.

With the onset of summer, customers also searched for airconditioners, coolers, fans and refrigerators in the appliances category. Summer also meant a demand for men’s T-shirts and shorts, kurtis for women and western summer dresses, apart from innerwear and nightwear. People also looked at buying kitchen and home appliances such as toasters, dishwashers, mixers, blenders and grinders.

With families spending a lot of time together, board games like Ludo, Chess, Carrom and Monopoly have become popular again, apart from PC games and toys. Books remained a favourite with customers looking for both fiction and non-fiction or textbook genres.

The residents and the businessmen of the area have become afraid after they came to know about the starting of the coronavirus treatment centre and quarantine/isolation centres at the Wankhede Stadium, which is near their houses. Representatives of various residents and business associations approached me in large numbers to strongly oppose this move,” wrote Purohit, a former Maharashtra cabinet minister, a six-time MLA and a senior BJP leader, in his letter to the BMC. Purohit sent a copy of the letter to police commissioner Parambir Singh.Dhruv Sayani, who resides in a building on D Road opposite the stadium, said, “There are many other open spaces in non-residential areas that the BMC can use for this purpose, including Azad Maidan and the gymkhanas ahead of Marine Drive.

BHOPAL: As Madhya Pradesh government prepares blueprint for lockdown 4.0, industries in the region hope for restriction-free environment with smooth movement of goods and mobilizing workforce from non-containment zones to industrial areas.

Industries demanded smooth movement of transport vehicles and workforce claiming manufacturing units cannot run in isolation as delay in supply of raw material and dispatch of finished goods is adversely hampering productivity in factories.

They sought relaxation on movement of workforce from non-containment zones of red zones to notified industrial belts Pithampur and Dewas.

Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FICCI) MP chairman Dinesh Patidar said, “In red zones, manufacturing could be allowed with specific standard operating procedures including entry and exit of workers. Smooth movement of raw material and finished goods should be ensured for industries to operate efficiently.”

Ahead of kharif sowing season, FICCI has stressed on the manufacturing and market availability of farm machinery stating any kind of delay or miss on cropping window may lead to shortage of produce.

Industries also asked the government to release pending Goods and Services Tax and subsidy refunds to ease liquidity crunch in the market.

CII Madhya Pradesh State Council’s vice-chairman Saurabh Sangla said, “Manufacturing units should be allowed to run at 70% capacity in all shifts to achieve their break-even cost. Government should also focus on easing liquidity crunch in market by releasing blocked refunds after quick verification.”

Industry demanded government to allow correspondence with banks and government offices through digital mode without the need to submit physical documents for time being.

Industry associations demanded permission to operate without a cap on number of workers and productivity, claiming this will help stop mass migration of workers to their native villages.

Association of Industries Dewas president Ashok Khandelia said, “Capping number of workers in a shift is not going to solve any purpose, on the contrary it will hit productivity and overall economy. No industry would want to shut down by flouting safety norms.”

Manufacturing units and textile mills have sought waiver of fixed electricity charges from March to June and demanded bill on actual consumption in line with other states like Punjab, Haryana, Andhra Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh.

MP textile mills Association chairman Akhilesh Rathi said, “State government should offer a relief package to boost exports of textiles and clothing. Industries should get relaxation on rent and maintenance charges. Water bill should be calculated as per the actual consumption.”

“I practise in Thane of Maharashtra. My parents live in Junagadh. As my mother was taken ill, I had come to Junagadh. However, after the lockdown was enforced, I was unable to return to Thane,” says Dr Patel .

For the past one-and-a-half month, Dr Patel had been stuck in Junagadh, not being able to return to her son in Thane. “Seeing my grandson crying for her mother through video call was heart-wrenching. To send my daughter back to Thane, I sought the help of Mr Jadeja, who along with traffic sub-inspector A C Zala, head constable Zaver Giri and deputy mamlatdar D K Baria coordinated with the district collectorate and helped my daughter procure a travel pass. After this, I drove my daughter in my car to Thane,” says Magan Poshiya, Dr Patel’s father and resident of Maheshweri Nagar near Sakkarbaug in Junagadh.

The way the Junagadh police helped her, impressed Dr Patel so much that she called up Junagadh DySP office after reaching Thane and thanked the Junagadh police for extending their help.

“By setting such an example, we have proved once again that police are a true friend of public,” said an official from the Junagadh DySP office.

226,['17/05/2020'],Layoff compensation will be taxed as salary,"Representative Image

MUMBAI: Layoffs, including in India, have been an inevitable fallout of the coronavirus pandemic. Typically, retrenchment compensation is given and employees need to be aware of the tax incidence.

Owing to the narrow scope of the definition of a ‘workman’ under the Industrial Disputes Act (IDA), a plain, vanilla retrenchment compensation (say, 1-2 months’ salary) to a white-collar employee is likely to be classified, as a ‘profit in lieu of salary’ under section 17(3) of the Income Tax (I-T) Act. “On such ‘salary’ income, the employer will be required to deduct and deposit tax at source under section 192 of the I-T Act,” said Puneet Gupta, Director, People Advisory Services at EY India.

A few years ago, a labour court in Chennai had held a retrenched senior service programmer at a large IT company to be a ‘workman’ — thus busting the myth that the definition applies only to blue-collar workers. However, based on facts, courts have also held otherwise.

If an employee who is retrenched qualifies as a ‘workman’ and the retrenchment compensation paid is as per the provisions of the IDA, then under section 10(10B) of the I-T Act, an exemption of up to Rs 5 lakh can be claimed, with the balance compensation, if any, being taxed as salary income.

However, the term ‘workman’ is narrowly defined. Gupta explained, “Under the IDA, any person who is engaged mainly in a managerial or administrative role is not a workman. It also rules out those who have a supervisory role and earn wages of more than Rs. 10,000 per month. Thus, not all retrenched employees will fall into its ambit.”

Gautam Nayak, tax partner at CNK & Associates said, “Given the narrow definition of a workman under the IDA, the employer, in case of white-collar employees, is likely to err on the side of caution and will deduct TDS from the compensation amount.”

He added that the employee could, at the time of filing his I-T return, claim that the amount is exempt under section 10(10B), but it's likely to result in litigation. “If the compensation sum is not significant, taking such a path is best avoided,” he said.

Key employees, who have entered into non-disclosure agreements, and consequently on retrenchment are paid a given sum, will have to pay tax on this amount. “Post an amendment to section 56 of the I-T Act, it is no longer possible to treat such a one-off payment as a non-taxable capital receipt. If this compensation figure does not constitute profits in lieu of salary, it will be taxed as income from other sources,” said Nayak. The amendment could also cover compensation received from a foreign head office, said Gupta.

227,['17/05/2020'],Amending Essential Commodities Act will benefit private players: Rajasthan farmers,"JAIPUR: Farmers in Rajasthan on Saturday said the Centre must allow them to just sell their produce at minimum support price (MSP) anywhere in the country, and nothing less than that.

Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Friday said the government will amend the Essential Commodities Act to enable better price realisation for farmers by opening up multiple channels to sell produce and deregulating agriculture produce like cereals, edible oils, oilseeds, pulses, onions and potato.

They said, currently only 7% of the total agriculture produce is being sold at MSP in the country and the rest is sold at a cheaper rate. The move will only benefit the private buyers as they can purchase agriculture produce from anywhere in the country with a single license (i.e. one holding a license of a mandi in one state can purchase agriculture produce from any other state) and having no stock limits on produce will only encourage hoarding and lead to inflation. They further said the government of India, by doing this, is only trying to hide its weakness because it is unable to purchase food grains from the farmers and store it in FCI godowns.

“There are no restrictions for the farmers to sell their produce anywhere in the country. Even now, they can sell their agriculture produce anywhere - be it in the mandis, markets, colonies or roadside. They can also go to other states and sell their produce. The government of India will only make it official now by amending the law. This move will only benefit the private buyers as they can purchase agriculture produce from anywhere in the country with a single licence. Only good thing is there will be no stock limit on these commodities. But, this will move also help the businessmen because it will encourage hoarding and lead to inflation,” said Dashrath Kumar, a farmer from Kota.

“Instead, the government should have allowed them to sell their produce at MSP anywhere in the country. Nobody should be allowed to purchase the produce at a rate less than MSP. Else, the government should compensate the farmers. This move would have benefited the farmers,” he added.

Another farmer from Banswara, Manilal Mandana, also echoed similar sentiments while saying, “Now, the farmers can sell their produce anywhere without any restrictions and can get profitable rates. This will benefit the farmers. Also, the private purchasers will not have to pay 2% mandi tax if they buy the produce from the farmers outside. But, the government should allow selling of maximum agriculture produce at MSP anywhere.”

228,['17/05/2020'],Jails in Rajasthan identifying spaces within premises to isolate coronavirus suspects,"Picture used for representational purpose only

JODHPUR: Jails in Rajasthan are gearing up to receive prisoners, some of whom could be Covid-19 positive, once the lockdown is lifted.

The jail authorities believe that as police and the courts get back to their normal routine after the lockdown ends, prisons across the state will receive new inmates. To deal with situations where new prisoners test positive for Covid-19, a move has been initiated to create separate spaces that would act as isolation or quarantine wards in jails.

The authorities are identifying space within state jails that have not been of any significant use or have been left unused for long, to keep new inmates under isolation.

“The move is aimed at creating more space in the central jails, especially with a view to accommodate new inmates that are expected to be received in bigger numbers in comparison to the lockdown period,” said DIG (Jail) Kailash Trivedi.

In this pursuit of creating space, female inmates have been shifted to other jails so that the cells for them could be used for keeping the new inmates. “We have shifted female inmates of Jodhpur Central jail to Ajmer jail and have planned to keep the prisoners from Jodhpur, Phalodi and Bilara at Jodhpur jail,” Trivedi said.

Similarly, female inmates from Kota have also been shifted to Ajmer, while those from Bharatpur and Alwar have been shifted to Jaipur Central Jail and so on.

Terming it a temporary arrangement, Trivedi said the spurt in the number of inmates post-lockdown might take the government off-guard and the administration will rush for exploring a solution.

“So, we are ensuring that adequate space is generated in jails well in time to ward off the threat of infection,” the officer said.

Jodhpur Central Jail has received over 100 inmates in 50 days of lockdown and all of them have been kept at the industrial facilities of the jail. But since they are old buildings, the jail administration will be accommodating new inmates in the women’s jail, which is newly constructed.

As a matter of fact, all jails have stepped up practicing precautionary measures with the reports of inmates in Jaipur Central Jail testing positive for Covid-19.

The entire premises of Jodhpur central jail was sanitised twice on Saturday. District & Sessions judge Siddheshwar Puri also visited the jail on Saturday and gave necessary directions to the jail administration.

It may be noted that by the order of the District Legal Services Authority, all the new inmates are being taken only after their screening by the district administration so as to avoid any prospect of infection on the jail premises.

Dr Asima Bhanu, infection control officer at the centre, says over 250kg comes from Personal Protection Equipment (PPE) kits alone. Bengaluru Urban, a red zone, has 107 active cases as on May 16.KSPCB identified 26 facilities in the state that are equipped to handle Covid-19 biomedical waste. They have dedicated vehicles, which pick up the waste from designated hospital and hotels. Donning PPEs, waste handlers disinfect the yellow bags before collecting them.“These facilities treat regular biomedical waste too. But Covid-19 biomedical waste is treated separately as per protocol. We are equipped to handle 15-20 times the biomedical waste being generated at present, in case the situation worsens in future.

231,['17/05/2020'],Jaipur: Cyber cops warn against online frauds,"Representative image

JAIPUR: The cyber cell has issued an advisory to be extra cautious while dealing with unknown numbers, links, apps and messages to avoid being duped by frauds. During the lockdown, 90% of the crime cases have been of financial frauds in which new ways, including calls for health details for coronavirus data, are being devised to dupe people.

“As the lockdown is in place, people are devising ways to come up with fraud ideas. People have to be extremely cautious while dealing with unknown callers and even those which might be known to the person being called. Confidential information must not be shared irrespective of the purpose. This is the reason we regularly issue advisories/ suggestions,” said an official of the cyber crime cell, Jaipur.

While selling on sites like OLX, Quicker and others, people also have to be careful as in many instances the conmen pretend to be buyers and claim that they will transfer the money in the seller’s account, but instead money is withdrawn using various methods of hacking if account details are shared. The advisory also says that a person should always use ATM card alone without taking help from strangers in the booth. Also ATM machines in isolated locations should be avoided as these are easy target for fraudsters who put skimmers on these ATMs. Unconfirmed and dubious SMSes and links should also not be forwarded.

The official added, “While no bank asks for account details on phone, the one-time-password (OTP) must not be shared at any cost. In case a fraud does happen, then police must be informed immediately. Recently, we had a case in which we got information about the fraud soon after the money was deducted from the account. Although the money was deducted from the complainant’s account, we managed to stop it from getting transferred to the fraudster’s account.”

VADODARA: A controversy surfaced at state-run SSG Hospital after 42-year-old priest of the famous Kashi Vishwanath temple at Lalbaug died early on Saturday morning.

Family members of the deceased – Ashwin Dave – alleged negligence by a neurosurgeon, alleging that he did not attend the patient for at least three hours despite their desperate requests.

Dave had had met with a road accident on May 11 when he had gone out to purchase some groceries. He was taken to SSG Hospital and discharged after treatment.

“But his condition deteriorated on Friday and hence brought him to the SSG Hospital where doctors of orthopaedic department referred the case to neurosurgery department as his spinal cord had got damaged,” said another relative.

SSG Hospital’s medical superintendent Dr Rajeev Daveshwar said that the hospital has asked the neurosurgery department to respond to the allegations in writing.

“Prima facie, when the patient was first brought to our hospital, he was advised operation by the neurosurgeon. But the family members went against medical advice. We have this in writing with signatures of two members of the family,” said Dr Daveshwar. “On Friday, he was again brought to our hospital in unconscious state and was given the required treatment. But early morning, the family took him out of the hospital without the knowledge of the staff and and shifted him to some private hospital. I have been informed that the patient died outside our premises,” said Dr Daveshwar

Authorities are still inquiring whether there was any lapse from the hospital side in handling the case.

Hospital authorities, however, refuted the claims and said that Dave was twice shifted out of the hospital even as the doctors had advised him to undergo surgery. “Since my uncle was referred to neurosurgery department, I approached the doctor with the file at around 5.30am. He said he would reply after two hours. Even as I kept on insisting that the patient is critical and needs urgent attention, the doctor simply refused to listen to my pleas,” said Prathmesh Dave, the deceased’s nephew.

Dave’s family members refused to take possession of the body, demanding action against the doctor. It was only after police intervened that the body was sent for post-mortem.

He affirmed that he would not settle the bill unless Hescom clarified how it had arrived at the sum. “What arrears have Hescom officials added to the bill, and how are we to trust them?” he asked.Venu G Soganadgi, another resident who took to social media to express his outrage at the exorbitant sum he had been asked to pay by Hescom, said, “On average, I paid a sum of Rs 1,000 in electricity bill per month. But this time, the sum was a staggering Rs 5,500. This is unreasonable even if the bill is for a period of two months.”Hescom, however, has been responding to all complaints. “The bill reflects the sum of two months’ power consumption, and cancelling the last month’s average bill.

238,['17/05/2020'],"Power use fell 19.7% last month, emissions down 11%","Nagpur: In the last one month, the country’s lockdown has led to electricity consumption plummeting 19.7%, finds a new data tracker developed by researchers at the Energy Policy Institute at the University of Chicago. The tracker also finds an 11% drop in particulate pollution during this period.

The dynamic tracker, which shows the impact of the coronavirus on electricity consumption and particulate pollution, includes data not just for India but also for China and the United States among others.

The tracker indicates that China’s electricity consumption dropped by approximately 15% in January. In the United States, demand has fallen by an average of 3.5% since the nationwide stay-at-home recommendations were issued, compared to December 2019.

As reported by TOI last month, power consumption in the country has fallen by 18.72%. The emissions of particulate matter during the initial period of lockdown saw a nearly 7% decline.

“A drop of 19.7% is a stark decline — larger than the reductions we have seen in China, the US, or Europe as a whole, and similar to Italy between mid-March and mid-April. This indicates that the Indian economy has been strongly affected by the Covid-19 pandemic and associated lockdowns, in line with the strict policy actions taken in India to stop the spread of the virus,” said Fiona Burlig, assistant professor at the University of Chicago Harris School of Public Policy.

Burlig along with Anant Sudarshan, South Asia director of the Energy Policy Institute at the University of Chicago, and Steve Cicala, assistant professor at the University of Chicago Harris School of Public Policy, carried out the analysis presented in the tracker.

Declining and increasing consumption has historically preceded economic recessions and recovery. Explaining why the findings of the tracker can be crucial, Sudarshan says, “A major challenge with fast-moving economic events like Covid-19 is that our normal statistics, which tell us about the health of the economy — GDP, job creation etc — are reported relatively slowly (often quarterly). Electricity consumption is a metric available in near-real-time, making it informative about the overall health of the economy as well as the response of the economy to policies like the nationwide lockdown.”

Apart from indicating the electricity consumption pattern, the data tracker also gives insights into the situation of particulate pollution of different countries around the world. Talking about India, Sudarshan adds, “Particulate pollution is on average 11% lower than what would have been expected using a pre-Covid model of particulate matter. And that means that the declines we’re seeing are after adjusting for seasonality in particulate matter. We see the largest reductions in March (20% on average), while April levels are less low (6% on average).”

After missing several deadlines in the past, the civic body had announced to complete the project by November 2020. But, in the aftermath of Covid-19, the work is now expected to be completed by March next year.

Following the directions of UDH minister Shanti Dhariwal, the civic body resumed several works at construction site including segment launching, pier cap work near railway line and reinforcement of earth wall. JDA commissioner T Ravikanth said, “The elevated road from Ambedkar Circle to Sodala is being constructed after spending Rs 250 crore. The work has been resumed with intent to complete the project on time for public.”

An official informed that partial work, which is constructing of launching segments, is being carried out in the casting yard at Mahapura. For this, 300 labourers are deployed, of which 200 are from outside states. “The project agency has provided accommodation and other necessary facilities to all the labourers. They are also adhering to the Covid-19 advisory issued by the state government,” he said.

Once completed, the commuter would reach Sodala from Ambedkar Circle within 7 minutes via Hawa Sadak. Construction of the elevated road to decongest the area came to a grinding halt after the lockdown. An official said the JDA will launch 1,130 segments in the entire project. So far, around 760 segments have been completed. “It will take around a year to complete the project.”

Sources added that the project, which was due to be completed in January 2019, has already been delayed almost by a year and is expected to be delayed further. According to a JDA source, the firm, Simplex Infrastructures, had also expressed helplessness to continue the project at the existing cost. A senior source at JDA said estimated cost of the road project between Ambedkar Circle and Sodala is Rs 250 crore. “The project cost has been increased by at least Rs 25 crore due to constant delays,” the JDA official said.

All the lockers are full and now we have to open our store room to make space for ashes,” said Chandani. Similarly, Cheelgati crematorium administrator Anil Sharma said because of space crunch, they are keeping containers of ashes in whatever place is available. “Lockers are full and we are forced to keep ashes on the floor. It will be a while when people will be able to travel for immersion. Till then we are expecting that piling up will continue,” said Sharma.

Residents of the city are demanding some relaxation in rules for immersion. City resident Krishna Mahrishi said, “I went for a funeral of my close relative a few days back.

JAIPUR: Jhalana reserve forest, where the country’s first Project Leopard was started two years ago, is becoming a nursery for leopards in the state. This year has seen a rapid growth in leopard population at the city’s Jhalana Leopard Safari Park. The most recent sighting was of leopardess Jalebi with one cub captured on trap camera.

This is the fifth leopardess to give birth in the park since January and now the population stands at 22 adults and 10 cubs, according to the forest official.

“This year, a leopardess called Flaura was sighted with three cubs in the beginning of the year. The other three female leopards LK, Mrs Khan and Sharmili gave birth to cubs subsequently resulting in an increase in the young population,” said a forest official.

After the pictorial evidence, security arrangements have been stepped up in the forest area. The forest department officials are monitoring the movement of the new cub.

A senior forest official further elaborated, “The leopard count has been steadily increasing in this particular forest area, mainly due to efficient monitoring as well as significant efforts to provide a protected environment to the wildlife.”

Although, the population increase is good news for wildlife lovers, sources at the park involved in its management claimed that Jhalana has more leopards than its capacity. “Jhalana is spread over 22sqkm and the big cat population is higher than its carrying capacity. There are four dominant males (Rambo, Bahadur, Bageehra and Sultan) in Jhalana and two (Bluethunder and Prince) in Galta region. The young leopards do not have any territory and possibilities of straying into residential areas are high,” said an expert.

Currently, there are approximately 35 leopards, including the young offsprings, in the safari park which means less than one square kilometre per animal, once they grow up, claimed experts.

MYSURU: It’s a common thing for elected representatives to complain against officials for their inefficiency in work. However, on Saturday, politicians showered flower petals on officials of district administration for bringing down the Covid-19 cases in Mysuru to zero from a whopping 90.While the central and state governments have earlier showered petals on medical officers, nurses and police personnel, even from helicopters, for the first time, top officials received such an honour for their work in controlling the spread of infection.District incharge minister ST Somashekar , former minister and MLA GT Devegowda, MLAs SA Ramadas and L Nagendra and MP Pratap Shima showered flower petals on deputy commissioner Abhiram G Sankar, MCC commissioner Gurudatta Hegde, DCP AN Prakash Gowda, SP C B Ryshyanth, district health officer R Venkatesh and other officials at a ceremony.During the programme, minister Somashekar, while appreciating the work of DC Abhiram Sankar, said during the crisis, some DCs did not step out of their chambers and gave instructions to their subordinates sitting in their air-conditioned chambers. “However, Abhiram Sankar did not sit in his chamber but travelled all over the district extensively and took measures to control the virus. The credit for controlling the spread of virus should go to all department workers,” he said.Minister ST Somashekar said the government, recognising the services of ASHA workers, has decided to give Rs 3,000 for each worker. “The government is spending Rs 12.37 crore for the initiative. There are 40,500 ASHA workers in the state,” he said.

The deceased lived with his parents and sibling and was unmarried.

According to sources, he had a shop which he had reopened but was also under stress due to lack of business though at present the cops have neither confirmed nor denied this possibility.

251,['17/05/2020'],Virtual hearings a real challenge for trial courts,"New Delhi: The ongoing “restricted functioning” of Delhi’s courts has had a mixed impact on litigants While Delhi high court has gone high-tech to help litigants participate in virtual hearings, it is the trial courts where the real challenge has become apparent. In the pre-lockdown times, these courts would usually see footfall of lakhs of litigants and lawyers every day. In absence of physical court hearings, the six court complexes scattered across the capital have all of a sudden been exposed to operating virtually even if only in extremely urgent matters, such as bail.Judges and lawyers say the dependence on physical movement of files and status reports is much higher in trial courts than high court, while litigants complain they are unable to participate.A source said that litigants are being represented through their counsels via videoconferencing , but “if the court deems fit depending on the nature of litigation, a litigant can appear on its directions.” This may now happen at least in bail hearings relating to sexual offences. The high court last week directed all trial courts to first hear the stand of complainants/victims before granting any relief to the accused.Neeraj Arora, a litigant whose eviction case is pending in Tis Hazari, said he was waiting for the courts to re-open. “My long-pending case was in a critical stage of cross-examination of the defendant. Since courts are shut, no hearing has taken place,” Arora told TOI.His lawyer Arpit Bhargava added, “In absence of litigant participation in virtual hearings, it becomes difficult for me to get proper briefing from the client. We have decided to wait for the courts to open.”However, not all are complaining. Ajay Bhutani appeared in a case from home before a high court bench recently, where his lawyer Prabhjit Jauhar argued via videoconferencing. Bhutani found the experience wonderful.“Going to court involves a lot of hassles, crowd and scrimmage. This was my first such experience and it turned out to be a very relaxed one. The court gave ample time for parties to be heard. Though one doesn’t get the feel of the courtroom, I found it more convenient and effective,” he said.Jauhar said efforts could be made even in trial courts. “Everybody has a smartphone these days. Perhaps once the lockdown norms are relaxed, a litigant can meet his/her lawyers and do videoconferencing together till courts don’t resume normal functioning,” he added.What remains to be seen is if the litigant-friendly practice being followed in high court can be rolled out on a much larger scale in district courts too.",delhi,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-47529300,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-110164,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/virtual-hearings-a-real-challenge-for-trial-courts/articleshow/75795245.cms
252,['17/05/2020'],Govt agrees to IMA’s demand to treat docs with dignity,"Nagpur: The Maharashtra government has agreed to the Indian Medical Association’s (IMA) demand to treat doctors with dignity. It also agreed to constitute a state coordination committee comprising government secretaries and officers with the inclusion of the IMA Maharashtra president and members. The government further consented to provide personal protection equipment (PPEs) kits to even private doctors and health care workers.

All these major decisions came after IMA's crucial meeting with chief secretary Ajoy Mehta, where many important discussions on various crucial issues took place and some solutions were agreed upon.

Principal health secretary Dr Girish Vyas and health services director Dr Archana Patil participated in the meeting. From IMA, state president Dr Avinash Bhondwe, past presidents — Dr Ravindra Wankhedkar, Dr Jayesh Lele and Dr Ashok Tambe, former secretary Suhas Pingle and secretary Pankaj Bandarkar — took part. Maharashtra Medical Council president Dr Shivkumar Utture also attended the meeting held in Mumbai.

According to the IMA president, the medicos at various places are treated rudely by the government administrators and officers. “They should be treated with dignity and their suggestions and complaints should be listened to with the satisfactory solutions. The chief secretary accepted our demand and agreed to send a notification to all the collectors, municipal commissioners and other administrators,” Bhondwe said.

Both sides also came to an agreement to constitute a state coordination committee comprising government secretaries and officers along with the IMA state chief and members. The government established the committee after seeking governor’s nod and also named sub-panels in each district comprising collector and respective IMA president.

The IMA team suggested a uniform policy about the fees and the hospital charges for the Covid and non-Covid patients treated by the private hospitals. According to it, the advisories issued by the various collectors are contradictory and inconsistent. They suggested acquisition of private hospitals under Mahatma Jyotiba Phule Yojana and be paid accordingly.

The government granted its nod for IMA’s proposal to acquire the private hospitals for Covid-19 treatment as per the health ministry’s guidelines. It was concluded that all the orders, decisions, protocols of centre and state should informed to the IMA for smooth functioning of the Covid-19 control campaign.

The IMA team further pressed for providing the government approved PPE Kits with the fixed price to the private doctors and those should be made available at the medical/surgical stores and GST and SGST should be waived of.

253,['17/05/2020'],Intense heat drives migrants to spend time out in the open,"Bhubaneswar: The scorching summer has forced migrants putting up in quarantine centres to abandon their rooms and sleep under the open sky on the centres’ premises in several districts, endangering their lives. On Friday, a man was bitten by a snake at a quarantine centre in Balangir’s Sindhekela village.

In most villages, schools, community halls and panchayat offices have been converted into quarantine homes and most do not have fans. This has added to the woes of migrants already under stress due to the extension of quarantine from 14 to 28 days. And the centres that have ceiling fans, the radiation of heat from the concrete roofs both during the day and night, has made it unbearable for people to stay inside the building.

In Balangir district’s Agalpur block, the migrants mostly spend their time under the shade of the tree on the quarantine centre premises. They just keep their belongings in the rooms. “It is difficult to sleep inside the room. A person will keep sweating and feel exhausted because of dehydration. We come out after lunch leaving behind our luggage and just bring a mat with us to sleep on. We take a nap under the shade of the tree during the afternoon. The evenings are bearable though,” said Upendra Suna, who has returned from Tamil Nadu.

But Suna is always fearful of being bitten by insects and reptiles while sleeping. “During the summer, small reptiles often come out of their hiding places. One may be caught unawares,” Suna added.

Mohan Putel, vice-chairman of Agalpur block, said some migrants sought permission to sleep outside their room because of the heat. “We had to allow them to sleep in the open as they still will be within the premises and there is a boundary wall around the centre. They keep their belongings in the rooms and come out to chill. We have people to keep watch on the migrants at the quarantine centres,” he said. There is no scarcity of drinking water with a tube well on the premises.

In Bhadrak district, thousands of migrants blocked National Highway-16 protesting against poor quality of food and accommodation provided to them. The batch of 47 migrants, all natives of Bargarh district, had arrived at Charampa railway station. They came from Coimbatore.

254,['17/05/2020'],Owner contests letter of apology by migrant for stealing his cycle,"Jaipur/Alwar: A letter has gone viral as the writer says he is a migrant worker and he stole a cycle from a villager in Bharatpur to reach his home in Bareilly, Uttar Pradesh.

The writer has apologised for stealing the cycle, claiming that he has a physically challenged son and had no means to travel. The letter has garnered much attention and sympathy across the country.

However, the owner of the bicycle brushed aside the letter and has alleged that his cycle was stolen by someone from his own village. As per the owner, the thief from his village is trying to blame the migrant workers by writing a fake letter. No FIR has been filed in the matter.

The cycle was stolen from Rarah village in Bharatpur district in the wee hours of Monday and belonged to Prabhudayal’s family. He said, “Around 4 am on Monday, we found that my younger brother Sahib Singh’s cycle was missing. We found an apology note for stealing the cycle which was signed by a Mohammad Iqbal who claimed that he was from Bareilly and was traveling with his son. But the note is all hogwash and the cycle was stolen by someone from the village who we will catch soon.” The note which went viral said that the labourer was the culprit but was helpless and had to reach Bareilly, but the owners do not think any migrant took the cycle. “The cycle would not even cost Rs 300 which is why we did not register a FIR as it was an old cycle and was just parked close to the house. I am certain someone from the village wrote the note and the matter is unnecessarily being highlighted. It is not the work of an outsider but someone local,” added Prabhudayal.

It has said that the government has backtracked on its assurances given during the negotiations following last year’s strike, when it was stated that unions will be consulted over any further move on corporatisation.

BMPS had actively taken part in the indefinite strike last year when the government had first announced its plans to corporatize the OFB. BPMS is a unit of Bharatiya Mazdoor Sangh (BMS), the trade union arm of RSS.

BPMS has said through a press release that the move was against the terms accepted during the negotiations as now a decision has been taken unilaterally.

In a meeting held on August 23 last year, following the strike, the government had assured that any decision on corporatisation will be taken after consulting the unions.

Mukesh Singh, the general secretary of BPMS, said there are plans to submit a memorandum to the government following which a protest may be held if the permission is secured.

Shirram Batwe of BPMS’ Nagpur unit, too. criticized the move calling it to be a betrayal in times of crisis.

Even the ICMR was told by the HC to supply these kits to government, but it was yet to supply it till date.

In its affidavit before the HC through government pleader Sumant Deopujari and additional pleader Deepak Thakre, the deputy director of health services in Nagpur circle, SK Jaiswal, informed that after receiving these kits those would be used for surveillance as per court’s directives.

The affidavit was filed in the PIL filed by Citizens’ Forum of Equality President Madhukar Kukde through counsel Tushar Mandlekar praying for directives to use rapid antibody test on front-line warriors fighting against the Covid-19 virus, including the doctors, health care workers and police.

Quoting the ICMR’s advisory of April 4, 17, and 22, to start rapid antibody test as a screening and surveillance tool as first mandatory step to test the suspected patients, the petitioner prayed for its immediate supply to the hospitals.

In last hearing, Justice Manish Pitale told the government that since the rapid antibody test results are quick, it would assist the government in deciding its strategy to deal with areas where there is rapid spread or apprehension of Covid-19.

AGP Deepak Thakre then informed that the government received 71,000 rapid antibody test kits for distribution in the Covid-19 hotspots across the state and those could be best used for the surveillance purposes. However, the ICMR later issued advisory that those kits were imported from China and its results were not up to the mark, therefore its usage was stopped till further orders.

The petitioner had also prayed for directives to conduct RT-PCR tests on the doctors, nurses, paramedical staff, pharmacist, and police doing the Covid-19 duties.

ICMR guidelines for testing patients

All symptomatic individuals who have undertaken international travel

All symptomatic contacts of laboratory confirmed cases & health care workers

All patients with acute respiratory illness (Fever, cough & shortness of breath)

Asymptomatic direct & high risk contacts of a confirmed case to be tested twice

263,['17/05/2020'],Owners to get 45% of developed land as compensation: Draft,"Jaipur: The much-awaited Land Pooling Act is expected to come into force soon in the state as the law department has cleared the draft on rules and regulations. Now, the draft requires final nod of the urban development and housing (UDH) minister Shanti Dhariwal for its implementation. Once implemented, owners whose land is acquired will receive 45% of developed land as compensation which was earlier 25%.

As per the provision, the civic body would give developed proportionate piece of land with all necessary infrastructure, including roads, parks and open spaces to the land owner. While as a facilitator, it can earn revenue by way of its share (including development cost), landowners get good value for their share of the land.

An official source said, “The development authority can ask expression of interest (EOI) from the farmers. Owners having a particular size of land can come forward,” he said. Land pooling policy was devised as an alternative to the cumbersome process of land acquisition for development. As per the Act, part of land will be used for urban infrastructure development with the consent of the owner, under the Land Pooling Scheme, instead of the UDH acquiring the land.

A senior official said, “Under the scheme, land owners can come and give their lands and authorities would act as a facilitator and develop the land as per layout rules. In Rajasthan too, the government would promote the Land Pooling Schemes (LPS), as the model is successfully implemented in many cities like Mumbai,” he said. The bill passed by the previous BJP government could not be implemented as the department failed to frame rules and regulations.

This will ensure minimal exposure of the uniformed personnel to the citizens without affecting policing responsibilities.Jasmeet Singh, DCP (East), elaborated, “Four teams have been formed to implement the contactless policing system. The first team has officers working at the police station, commuting daily between home and the police station. Another team will be on picket duty, a third will include those who patrol their specific beats. Members of these two teams will also commute between police station and home or guesthouse accommodation. The fourth team comprising 15 officers will stay at home for 10 days in reserve to attend to emergencies if some of the officers get infected.”Inspector Rajeev Kumar, SHO of Madhu Vihar police station, said that people coming to the police station have to first dip their footwear in a disinfectant solution at the gate. Then they proceed towards an automatic system of a 20-second handwash. This is followed by thermal scanning. The duty officer is the first point of contact at every police station, and an automatic sensor sanitiser has been placed outside the entrance.“Any room that is likely to see a public interface will have temporary partitions,” Kumar disclosed. The complaint room has been covered with transparent plastic sheets that act as a barrier between the complainants and the police officers attending to them. In case anyone wants to show a document or their identity details, the officer will take a picture of the document furnished before the complaint is submitted online. The receipt number is sent on the mobile phone. All documents submitted will undergo a protocol of sanitisation for 24 hours before they are put into the files.The SHO stated that if on a given day, more people visited the station and some of them were unable to meet the officers concerned, then the said officers, including the SHO, would try to make a video call to them. “People want to meet officers face to face to reassure themselves that their complaints have been heard,” said Kumar. “Whenever too many people come to the station, we note their contact numbers and call them on WhatsApp video. We will be encouraging people to minimise physical interaction and instead file online complaints or make video calls in case of any issue.”If anyone has work in other units, such as the record room, malkhana or the reader room, they will not be allowed to go there themselves, but will have their work facilitated by the police station staff.

NEW DELHI: The education department has written to Delhi Police asking it to register an FIR against two branches of Apeejay School for allegedly forging emails stating the directorate of education ( DoE ) had permitted them to increase fees.

The schools, however, said they had been working with DoE to dispel this “false and malicious allegation” and had “repeatedly demanded an urgent independent investigation”.

The letter was submitted to the station house officers of Saket and Malviya Nagar police stations on Saturday against the Saket and Sheikh Sarai branches, respectively.

On May 4, the department sealed both premises for alleged violation of the fee hike order. Enforcing the Disaster Management Act (DMA) and the Delhi School Education Rules, the department had ordered the action, including filing of an FIR. On May 5, following a plea by the school authorities, Delhi high court asked the department to de-seal the premises and give both branches a hearing.

According to the department letter, though the schools’ fee-hike proposals for 2017-18 was rejected and the same for 2019-20 are still under consideration, the branches “are unauthorisedly charging the increased amount of tuition and other kind of fees, unduly pressurising the parents and adopting coercive practices”. No proposal was submitted for 2018-19, it added.

“Thus use of fake emails to unauthorisedly increase the fee is an offence under relevant provisions of IPC and DP Act,” DoE alleged in the letter.

The department also claimed that nobody on the schools’ behalf appeared for a meeting scheduled with the director of education on December 18, 2019. “The school being very old and reputed is expected to know it well that such proposals for increased of fees are not granted on email, thus there is a wilful foul play by way of cheating , forgery and fraud besides extortion of unauthorisedly claiming arrears and increased fees from parents,” the letter stated.

In a statement, the schools said, “We are actively working with DoE to dispel these false and malicious allegations and have repeatedly demanded an urgent independent investigation, but till date DoE has not responded.”

Quashing “previous similar action” by DoE, the high court has directed it to follow a proper process, the school authorities pointed out. “We have complete faith in the law and shall also be taking all legal action against miscreants who threaten the future of our students and tarnish the good name of our parents. With 50+ years of excellence, our values prevent us from bowing down to extortion and corruption at any level,” it added.

The school also wrote to DoE on Saturday asking it to appoint a mutually “agreed independent computer forensic professional or agency to review, verify, examine the veracity and certify the origin of the key approvals”.

“Due to the lockdown, the shops and businesses were also closed and usually vegetables vendors sit near the temple.

VADODARA: This year’s birthday for 15-year-old Aman Vania was slightly different from the earlier razzmatazz that the celebration entails every year. But Aman nevertheless made the day special not just for him, but for 100 others too.

Seeing his mother give a facemask and a pair of gloves to the sanitary worker who comes to their house to pick up garbage, Aman, who recently took his Class X exams, started worrying about other sanitary workers who may not be able to afford the mask.

“A day before his birthday on April 27, Aman came to me and said that he wants all sanitary workers and vegetable vendors be given reusable face masks and hand gloves on his birthday,” said his father, V R Vania, an inspector at Laxmipura police station. “It was not possible to distribute masks in the entire city, but we decided to distribute masks and gloves in areas under my police station,” Vania added.

“I wanted to distribute the masks and gloves since it was my birthday, but I also didn’t want to violate the lockdown norms and so I did not go out and only asked my father to distribute my gifts,” said Aman.

The masks and gloves were distributed among sanitary workers, vegetable vendors and staff of Laxmipura police station. “We explained the vendors how deadly the virus is and how they could avoid spreading it as they could be potential carriers,” inspector Vania said.

The vendors were asked to take pledge that they will wear the masks and gloves daily and make sure that social distancing is maintained around their cart.

Mahesh Palawat, chief meteorologist, Skymet, a private weather forecasting agency, said, “The thundershower was a result of a deep depression over the Bay of Bengal. The depression will turn to cyclone Amphan by Sunday morning. Humid winds are feeding moisture in coastal Andhra Pradesh and parts of Telangana. Short spells of rain and thundershowers are likely Sunday and Monday.”

Following this, Palawat said the wind concentration would be around the cyclone, which would leave the city facing two or three days of dry and hot weather.

IMD Hyderabad director K Naga Ratna said, “The rains were light to moderate in nature, accompanied with wind speeds of 40-50km/hr.”

Up to 7pm, Yousufguda circle received the highest rainfall of 55.3 mm, followed by Khairatabad with 54.3mm, and Jubilee Hills with 45.5 mm. Among the districts, Rangareddy recorded 50.3mm of rainfall, Medchal-Malkajgiri 41.8mm and Nalgonda 23.3mm.

Nagpada police personally monitored the situation at the railway station. “We have sent 1,400 migrant workers and their families to their hometown by train today. We are trying to help everyone as best as we can,” said Shalini Sharma, senior inspector of Nagpada police station.

On the morning of May 13, around 1,000 migrants had gathered near a hotel in central Mumbai’s Nagpada demanding a train for their native place. Police had to resort to lathi charge to disperse the mob. Later, cops began to call them, and the same night, a train with 1,300 migrants left from LTT for Lucknow.

Nagpada, known as the birthplace of the Mumbai underworld, is a major migrant hub. It is close to Mumbai Central, Nair and J J hospitals, Chor Bazaar and Bhendi Bazaar. It provides jobs to 30,000-plus migrants in zari units, leather bag and belt making units, garment and cloth shops, hotels and bakeries. All suppliers of mashkeeza—a leather sack in which water is transported—are from UP and Bihar.

Hairdressers said that they should be at least allowed to do haircutting, and not shaving as involves close contact with customers.

Each body takes more than 2 hours for the complete cremation in a CNG furnace ,” the official explained.A similar problem exists at Nigambodh Ghat. As per the data from North Delhi Municipal Corporation , it received 10 bodies of corona patients for funeral on Monday, 16 on Tuesday, 10 on Wednesday and 13 on Thursday.Suman Gupta who heads the NGO that manages the operations of the ghat said that only three out of six furnaces were operational. “We were about to get two more furnaces installed, but before the work could begin, the pandemic started. Now, even labourers are not available,” he said.“With the number of such cremations rising and people having to wait the entire day, more cremation grounds should be designated as Covid facilities to ease the pressure,” Gupta added.“Yesterday, we received 19 bodies and we already have a list of over 15 bodies to be cremated today. In the last three days, 44 bodies have been processed,” Gupta said on Saturday.A senior corporation official said there was a plan to create another CNG facility at Dwarka, but that did not materialise. “We should definitely have more electric and CNG units. We may have to resort to wood-based cremations if the load increases beyond capacity,” the official added.",delhi,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-75798667,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1134170,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/mourning-families-struggle-to-find-space-to-let-loved-ones-rest-in-peace/articleshow/75795269.cms
288,['17/05/2020'],"Strapped for supplies, food joints struggle to deliver","Pune: Restaurants in Pune are finding it difficult to continue offering home delivery as they are faced by a barrage of problems, including shortage of essential ingredients.

A shortage of staff and non-availability of essentials like capsicum, French beans, carrots and Indian spices have affected restaurants during the lockdown.

The demand for home deliveries has dropped by 90% compared to normal times, adding that if this persists, the few restaurants offering home delivery may also stop.

“The wholesale vegetable market has been closed for a month, affecting supply, while a vegetables like capsicum, carrots, French beans come from outside Pune and the state,” Ganesh Shetty, president, Pune Restaurants and Hoteliers Association, said.

“Restaurant-cooked food needs hundreds of spices, many of which are not available. Since supply to the city has been hampered, restaurants are finding it difficult to maintain quality,” he added.

Shetty said roughly 50 restaurants started home delivery a few weeks ago. Of those, around 40 have stopped, while an additional 10-15 started recently. “Everyone is at home and many do not feel the need to order from outside. The demand for home deliveries has dropped by 90%,” he added.

“We are just maintaining 35-40% of order volumes in Pune and other cities currently,” a source from a popular food delivery-based platform said.

289,['17/05/2020'],‘Disinfect schools before reopening’,"Visakhapatnam: The recent announcement by education minister Adimulapu Suresh that class X examinations will be held from July 10 to 15 has raised calls for the state government to ensure that schools and classrooms are safe to conduct examinations after nearly four months since they were closed in mid-March.

Narava Prakasa Rao, member of the organisation Right to Education (RTE) Forum Southern States steering committee said disinfecting and sanitising school buildings should be a priority as many schools, especially government and zilla parishad schools, have been used to quarantine Covid-19 suspects and shelter migrant workers.

In a letter to the education minister, Rao wrote, “It is also very important to sensitise and create awareness among students and parents on how they need to keep themselves clean, practice social distance while sitting or on the grounds, wear mask, wash hands and so on.”

Rao added that the education department must prepare a blueprint for disinfecting the schools at least 20 days before examinations, in coordination with line departments. The state government, he suggested, should start working on different strategies to sanitise schools and not open them in one move.

The letter also suggests that government schools make use of national television and radio broadcasters rather than online platforms as many students in government schools do not have access to smartphones.

Deputy district education officer, Visakhapatnam, Prem Kumar, said they are waiting for guidelines on social distancing and other Covid-19 precautions for students. “We will implement whatever guidelines are issued by the government in true letter and spirit,” said Kumar.

CHENNAI: Tamil Nadu reported 477 new Covid-19 cases and 939 patients were discharged from hospitals on Saturday while the state’s public health authorities remained divided on whether enough people were being tested for the infection. The state recorded three Covid-19 deaths on Saturday, taking the toll to 74.

A patient who underwent heart and lung transplant admitted to government hospital with Covid-19 was among those discharged, said health minister C Vijayabaskar.

Chennai recorded 332 new cases, Tiruvallur 10, Chengalpet 13 and Kancheepuram four. The new cases on Saturday include four passengers who returned from Dhaka, 81 from Maharashtra, seven from Gujarat and one from AP. In Tirunelveli, 44 people from Maharashtra tested positive. The district along with Thanjavur and Sivaganga recorded cases only among people who came from other states. The number of people tested dropped to 8,270 from 10,883 on Friday. The state has recorded a 40% drop since May 7 when it screened more than 14,000 people. On May 6, it had screened 13,281 people. While some members of the expert panel including National Institute of Epidemiology deputy director Dr Prahdeep Kaur and infectious disease expert Dr V Ramasubramanian have been pushing for testing as per ICMR protocol, some other members differed.

For instance, former city health officer Dr P Kuganandam said the state need not test asymptomatic contacts anymore. “It was required in the initial stages of the epidemic. Now, we should focus on protecting the aged and vulnerable people. Resources should be spent on testing, isolating and treating patients who need it most. This will ensure judicious use of testing,” he said. “More than anything else, it will protect the vulnerable, particularly in crowded cities like Chennai,” he said.

Senior officials maintained the high number of fresh cases should not be a cause for concern as long as the recovery rate is going up. On Saturday, the recovery rate was more than 33% and more people are likely to be discharged on Sunday. “We can’t chase the virus. We have to live with it,” said Greater Chennai Corporation special nodal officer J Radhakrishnan, who accompanied, health minister C Vijaya Baskar to containment zones in Chennai. “We need to promote “herd masking” and social distancing norms,” he said.

The total number of people who tested positive for Covid-19 in TN is 10,585 and 3,538 people have been discharged from hospitals.

Six days after a 65-year-old woman admitted on May 9 at private hospital died in Chennai, the state added her into the Covid death registry. The media bulletin from the Directorate of Public said she had “community acquired pneumonia” and active respiratory illness. “This does not mean there is community spread of Covid-19. It means the patient who acquired pneumonia from the community was tested positive for the viral infection,” said a senior official, who did not want to be named.

Two men – a 55-year-old with old pulmonary tuberculosis and a 78-year-old with diabetes mellitus and hypertension -- died on Friday. At the end of the day, 6,970 patients were still under treatment for Covid-19.

Senior officials in the health department said the state will soon empower police to fine people who do not wear mask or maintain social distancing norms.

According to health minister C Vijayabaskar, Erode has not registered a case for 21 days and Tiruppur has recorded no case for the last 15 days. “While many districts have not had a case for more than a week, we are seeing new challenges. We are having influx of passenger from other states. At least 20% of passenger are now testing positive,” he said. So far, 10 flights have landed in Tamil Nadu and 13 people who came in three flights were tested positive. All passengers in these flights have been quarantined. More passengers coming by train and trucks are being tested, he said.

KOCHI: Giving impetus to government’s efforts to increase number of tests to diagnose Covid-19, RNA extraction kits developed by Sree Chitra Tirunal Institute for Medical Sciences and Technology ( SCTIMST ) are all set to hit the market soon. Drugs Controller General of India ( DCGI ) approved commercial production and National Institute of Virology , Alappuzha , completed final validation of kits and gave its nod on Saturday.

Agappe Diagnostics Ltd, a Kochi-based pharma firm, entered into agreement with SCTIMST to commercially produce the RNA extraction kits. The national-level launch of the kit will be held at a function in Delhi next week, said sources.

“Shortage of RNA extraction kits was a major reason for low number of Covid-19 tests in the country. Currently, RNA extraction kits are imported. With competent agencies approving commercial manufacturing of the kits, it will solve the shortage issue of RNA extraction kits,” sources close to SCTIMST said. “Since all components of the kit are indigenously made, it will facilitate speedy production of RNA extraction kits on a large scale,” sources added.

“We are all set to produce the RNA extraction kits on a large scale as we have received all clearances required for commercial manufacturing. We have already got inquiries from across the country,” said sources with Agappe Diagnostics.

The firm is planning to produce at least 1 lakh kits this month. From June onwards, 3 lakh kits will be produced every month, sources with the company said. “Currently, the cost of imported RNA extraction kits is around Rs 300 apiece. Once we start production, we will be able to supply the kit at half the rate,” sources said.

Meanwhile, SCTIMST researchers modifying LAMP-N, a kit developed by the institute as a cheaper, faster and more accurate alternative to existing kits for RT-PCR tests. The technology has been transferred to Agappe Diagnostics and the firm is gearing up for its commercial production. Indian Council for Medical Research (ICMR), which is authorized to approve production of the kits, suggested certain modifications after initial rounds of validation. Once the kits produced by the private firm clears validation, the company can apply for licence from Drugs Controller General of India which is the final nod for commercial production of drugs and diagnostic kits.

Once the Chitra Gene LAMP-N is marketed, it can reduce the time and cost for diagonizing Covid-19. Currently, an RT-PCR test kit costs around Rs 4,500. Chitra Gene LAMP-N can be sold at around Rs 1,000 per kit, sources with Agappe said. Time required for generating results can also be reduced considerably.

305,['17/05/2020'],"Problem of plenty haunts mango growers, traders","Dharwad: Earlier, it was feared that the mango yield this season will be less due to the withering of flowers . Now, growers and traders in Dharwad district are facing the problem of plenty . The change in weather resulted in good harvest , but the growers’ happiness was short-lived due to Covid-19 lockdown .

In the normal course, hundreds of tonnes of mangoes grown in the district would be sent to Hubballi , Mumbai, Nagpur, Gujarat and Tamil Nadu , which house mango-pulp factories . Since these factories are closed due to lockdown , there are no buyers for the fruit. The factories, which restarted, reduced their intake of the fruit due to the shortage of labour .

Transport facilities are also less, making it difficult for the growers to send them to other markets. While the growers are dumping the fruits with the traders, the latter are unable to move them forward due to the lack of transport facilities and a decline in demand.

The price of mango , which used to be Rs 40,000 per-quintal, has come down to Rs 18,000. A driver from Navalur on the outskirts of Dharwad (P-673), who had taken 29 people to Maharashtra for selling mangoes, tested positive for Covid-19 , adding to the miseries of the mango growers and traders.

The amount that has reached the local market so far is just 20% of the total yield. ""We are in distress at a time when we have had a good yield. We were expecting to make some profit this time. But the Covid-19 crisis is not letting that happen,"" rued a mango grower.

There are eight mango trade centres between Kelgeri and Alnavar on Dharwad-Goa Road, where one can see heaps of fruits lying unsold.

District collector Daulat Desai had written to the director general of police (DGP) on Friday requesting not to allow people to travel to Kolhapur district without his approval. The demand comes in the wake of several patients testing positive for Covid-19 after coming to Kolhapur district from Mumbai and Pune—the cities worst affected the by the infection.

The district administration claimed that so far, 80,000 people have arrived in the district in the third phase of the lockdown.

“We are yet to receive the test results for most of them. We have made the throat swab sample collection compulsory for people arriving from Mumbai and Pune. They are released only if they test negative or turned to quarantine centres, if positive. The current arrangements are not enough to accommodate everyone. Hence, it is better to stop issuing travel passes to the people wanting to travel to Kolhapur district,” said Patil.

The district administration is checking entrants at the 20 checkpoints. Over 800 four-wheelers are arriving in the district everyday. The huge rush at the 13 screening centres set up in the district is putting a lot of strain on the existing staff.

“We already have two Covid-10 patients who travelled from Mumbai. I request people to stay back where they are for a while as after coming here, they will have to undergo the mandatory health check-up and not be allowed to return home unless the test results arrive,” said the district guardian minister.

Those returning from other places are advised home-quarantine for at least seven days.

“The village administrations have been asked to make quarantine arrangements with a capacity to accommodate 50 people. However, in some villages, the quarantine facilities are falling short against the number of people arriving,” said a district official.

But, activists say that enforcement has been too little to prevent the resurgence of banned plastics.

Civic body officials said that the plastic contrabands are door-delivered during the night as godowns for the banned plastic products are situated in the outskirts.

“Meat stalls are getting the plastic carry bags at their doorsteps. Trucks carrying essential commodities are used to transport the plastic carry bags in bulk from other parts of the state,” said KC Neelamegam, an environmental activist.

As parcel services in eateries and grocery stores are taking precedence due to lockdown restrictions, plastic carry bags have become essential for delivery. Locals said that traders are desperate to source single-use plastics to sustain their business as people are not carrying vessels or bags with them during the purchase.

“Not only door-delivery, some shops are still selling the banned plastic items clandestinely,” an eatery owner under the condition of anonymity added. Authorities said that they are considering a soft approach to tackle the situation as traders are already dejected over the poor business during the lockdown.

“It is not that we gave up on acting against the circulation of banned plastic products. Penalisation will continue, the public should cooperate by carrying a cloth bag with them during purchase,” an official with Trichy Corporation said.

Divulging details, Shahjahanpur Eidgah Committee secretary Sayed Qasim Raza said the decision was taken by the members at a recent meeting of the committee. “The pandemic is gradually gripping our country. Our mosques are closed and we have been offering prayers at home. Thus, we have decided not to go out for buying clothes or shopping. Eid will be a quieter affair this year.”

Mohammed Aadil, a mobile shop owner, told TOI, “We don’t want news channels to debate that the Covid cases surged due to the Eid gatherings. For us, there is no Eid without ‘Alvida’ (main Eid namaz prayer). We can’t hug each other, can’t invite people, can’t read ‘tarawih’ prayers in groups and will not be able to follow all the guidelines of Ramzan. People are dying of coronavirus and the future is uncertain. So, all my relatives have decided not to buy clothes and rather support the people in need.”

Mohammed Irfan, a sports teacher, told TOI, “My wife and I have decided not to buy clothes and donate money among needy people. However, I have bought a dress for my five-month-old daughter as it’s her first Eid. I will pray to Allah to finish the disease and save humanity. Every day, I burst into tears after reading about the condition of migrants workers. I wish I had the power to improve their condition.”

Another local who wished not to be named told TOI, “We are very scared. So, we have decided to stay at home to avoid any untoward situation.

On Friday, Kolhapur Municipal Corporation (KMC) declared that those who paid the propert tax as early as possible would get a 6% concession. The 6% concession is in place if citizens pay the property tax within the first three months of the fiscal. As a result, many citizens rushed to the facilitation centres and the civic body managed to collect over Rs 40 lakh.

Activist Baba Indulkar said, “Wooing citizens with concessions which are already there in the tax rules is an insensitive decision. The KMC should announce the tax concession only after the lockdown ends and people go to the work. If people do not pay tax after the lockdown, the KMC can impose a fine.”

Activists claimed that many tenants were being harassed to pay the rent and clear other bills so that their owners could avail of the concession offered by the KMC in property tax payment.

Chief property tax superintendent Sanjay Bhosale said, “We are not forcing anyone to pay the tax. Citizens can pay the property tax by June 30. We have declared a concession which is already there in the rule books. There is no such policy for tax breaks.”

The NGO has now begun implementing the model in Naregaon. As part of the modus operandi, the NGO develops and maintains a healthy relationship between the three key links of their ration distribution chain i.e. the donors, the co-ordinators and the beneficiaries.

According to Shaikh Waseem of the NGO, a lot of people come forward to donate food and ration to needy during the lockdown period. However, due to lack of co-ordination and data, not all needy receive the benefits while a selected few are repeatedly benefited, he said.

“We have decided to form a committee of 20-25 persons to identify the total need of the entire area so that we can target towards closure and trace individual donations with small number of kits easily. Committee members identified needy families around respective mosques to track required number of food kits. Based on this data, the individuals and organisations willing to donate are posted about the requirements,” he said.

323,['17/05/2020'],"Trichy: In this restaurant, mutton comes with a mask","TRICHY: In times of the pandemic, what better way to boost one’s business than by contributing your mite to driving away the dreaded coronavirus. A non-vegetarian eatery in the city is doing precisely that by incentivising customers with gloves, masks and sanitizers depending on their food orders.

The restaurant, ‘Only Biriyani’, provides reusable face masks and hand gloves besides hand sanitizers along with orders worth over Rs 300. “People are expecting offers but instead of giving cash discounts, we thought of promoting preventive measures to overcome Covid-19. A few customers were seen without face masks, so we planned to give protective gear as gifts along with the food to encourage them to stay safe,” Mohandoss Balaji, proprietor of the Thillai Nagar-based outlet said.

People giving orders for more than Rs 1,000 get hand sanitizer bottles and those above Rs 300 face masks. Reusable cotton hand gloves are gifted to those who place an order for over Rs 600. However, the gifts, worth between Rs 10 and Rs 250, are not applicable for customers who place their orders through online food agregators. “As the response was good, we have planned to continue the gifts for takeaway orders till May 31” Mohandoss added.

Since dining-in is prohibited during the lockdown, eateries here are desperate to attract customers as many still hesitate to buy even takeaway food. While some of the eateries have slashed prices of takeaways, a few restaurants have come forward to offer free home delivery too. While pointing out that restaurants are struggling to stay afloat despite the relaxations in lockdown, food entrepreneurs said they are keenly awaiting the full-fledged resumption of offices to shore up their business.

Magician Kunal Newar peers into the laptop’s video camera, tears out a page from a writing pad and sets it on fire. The paper crumbles and morphs into a sanitizer. His viewers, spread across Pune, Mumbai, Delhi and Bengaluru, squeal with delight.

Welcome to the world of online magic. With remote working being the norm during the lockdown, many magicians in Pune have gone online with their bags of tricks and feats of mentalism.

“The decision to go online was born out of sheer desperation. After my last show on March 19, I didn't know what to do. So, I went on Instagram and performed a few magic tricks. Then, I pitched the idea of virtual magic to corporates and event managers. Now, even families are approaching me to host shows for their friends and relatives,” said Pune-based Newar.

The idea of virtual magic has caught on among many illusionists in the city. Magician Shardul has set up a studio at his home in Undri to give viewers the feel of a live theatre show.

“Most people are bored sitting at home because they have limited sources of entertainment. I try to relieve their stress and bring some happiness to their lives,” he said.

A typical show begins with Shardul rubbing sanitizer on his hands. “I tell the viewers that for the next few minutes they are in safe hands,” he smiled.

Shardul then asks the audience about their dreams and aspirations. When they tell him about their dreams, he fishes out a piece of paper where he had already written them down. “It's all mind reading,” said Shardul, who has live-streamed his shows in Bangalore, Kolkata, Delhi and Mumbai apart from Pune. The duration of the shows varies between 20-45 minutes.

Mentalism takes the cake among the feats performed by magicians online. “This is because people might find magic amazing, but mentalism appears to be believable,” said Amit Kalantri, a city-based magician and mentalist.

For the magicians, the live-streaming platforms provide a more engaging medium. “As a performer, I feel connected to the viewers since it is a closed environment and I have their undivided attention,” said Kalantri.

For now, the magicians know that there is very little chance of them performing on stage anytime soon.

“Online shows are the way to go,” he added.

AHMEDABAD: The association of hospitals welcomed the move by the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) to revise their compensation rates, to about 2.5 times. They, however, added that some operational issues remain to be resolved, for which they would soon hold a meeting with the civic body.

Dr Bharat Gadhvi, president of Ahmedabad Hospitals and Nursing Homes Association (AHNA), said the rate revision was a great step and was one of the demands of the association to ensure the best treatment for the patients. “The sharing formula is not according to the suggestion put forth by us. A few grey areas have remained for which we will be writing to them soon,” he said.

The members pointed to the criteria based on which hospitals are identified and acquired. “Cost was one part of the issue we put forth to the AMC,” said Dr Niket Shah of Bopal ICU. “Our hospital is located in a commercial complex and there is no separate elevator for patients. We have made a representation on such issues to the authorities. It’s not possible to treat all hospitals by the same parameters.”

Some areas, which do not receive piped water supply are facing severe water crisis as tankers are unable to reach there due to the Covid-19 containment barricades.

According to Pratibha Abhijit Nagdeve, who lives opposite Milind College, her locality does not get tap water and is dependent on tankers. “Due to the barricades put up for Covid-19 containment plan, the tankers cannot enter our locality and we face sever water crisis,” Nagdeve said.

When asked, water supply executive engineer Kiran Dhande said that he had visited several areas where tanker routes are obstructed due to barricades. “We cannot remove the barricades as it can be dangerous. So, I have identified substitute routes which are longer than the regular routes and asked the tanker drivers to use those to continue providing water,” Dhande said.

Rajendra Sonawane, a resident of the Cidco N-2 area, had a dialysis appointment at a private hospital. However, just when he and his wife had to leave for the hospital, water supply was resumed after a delay of one day and six hours. The couple narrowly missed their appointment as they had to stay back for storing water.

Renuka Chautmal, a resident of Jaibhim Nagar, which had had 70 confirmed Covid-19 cases until Saturday, said that they are getting water supply once in eight days.

Civic activist Rahul Ingle said that it is nearly impossible for people to sustain in the supply provided by the Aurangabad Municipal Corporation.

Meanwhile, three patients were discharged after recovery while two are in serious condition, added the officials.

The district administration is going all out as far as testing is concerned. Swabs of as many as 3,000 people, who returned to Kolhapur district from red zones and covid hotspots, were sent for testing in the last three days.

The administration is collecting swab samples — symptomatic as well as asymptomatic — of the migrants who travelled into the district from high-risk areas. However, the health directorate has communicated to the district administration that this policy is not as per their guidelines.

According to the health directorate, the swabs of only symptomatic people should be taken for testing.

The basis of the directive by the health directorate is unknown. Some sources claimed that this may be to avoid the expenditure on tests, each of which costs around Rs 3,500.

On Saturday, the district officials deliberated over the letter issued by the state health directorate for a couple of hours. An official privy to the discussion said it was decided to continue to collect the swabs of all those returning from high-risk zones.

“So far we have the lowest death rate, mainly due to paying attention to asymptomatic migrants. ,” said the official on condition of anonymity.

They themselves took her to the various departments for check-ups and swab collection. She died a few hours later and the family members took the body to the mortuary. The family members were told to go home and return the next day, by when, the Covid-19 test result was expected.“At 11pm, Chikalthana police entered our lane sounding sirens and told us to go to the GMCH. In a few minutes, a van from the Satara police station also came.

It’s been four days since she last found one, but for the construction worker who sustains on government’s free rice and doesn’t have money even to buy a cup of tea, the arduous journey can make all the difference between life and death.

She had exhausted all her little savings in the prolonged lockdown, and her two sons who live separately with their families, too, are finding it hard to help her as they don’t have jobs themselves.

Not just Velammal, hundreds of villagers make the perilous trip on foot to Madurai city each day looking for the elusive job that may get them Rs 450 per day.

P Shenbagam, 50, of Sakkimangalam, too, has not got any work for the last three days. “It’s 9.30am, but I haven’t got any work. Only a few have been lucky today. I will wait for another 30 minutes, and if I don’t get a job, I will have to walk back 10km to my village. It has been nearly 45 days since I earned any money,” she said. The labourers start walking from their villages around 7am and reach places like Ambiga Theatre Junction at Anna Nagar in the city and wait for contractors or households to pick them up for jobs. If they don’t get one, they must walk back to their homes with empty pocket and stomach, only to repeat the ritual the next day.

There are at least seven places such as Anna Nagar in Madurai where the labourers congregate every day.

During normal days, at least seven thousand workers come to Madurai a day in search of jobs. At least 70% of them manage to get a job, and work is available at least 20 days a month.

But now things are difficult, and jobs are hard to come by.

Next to agriculture, the construction industry employs most of these semi-skilled workers in Madurai district. While locals get employed in small construction activities, 40% to 50% workforce in government contracts and major construction projects are migrant labourers.

Although the government has given its nod to start construction activities, it is yet to begin in full swing in the district.

R Ilankovan, state secretary, CREDAI, said only a few realtors have started work, and others are waiting for the state government to bring down the price of steel and cement which has increased considerably. Prices of M-sand and bricks, too, have increased due to hike in price of diesel. Those who have started work are aiming to complete existing projects and no new projects are being taken up, he said.

A Rajendran, president, Madurai district construction labourers’ union attached to CITU, said in the absence of public transport facilities, construction workers have to walk long distances for work. The Rs 1,000 given for unorganized sector workers is not adequate and government should come forward to give more relief, he said.

The petition sought extension of tier-4 visas and waiver of third-term tuition fee for international students.

Lalitha Sai Chandrika Kamisetti’s petition has already got more than 5,500 signatures against the target of 10,000 with the deadline being November 11. A large number of Telugu students have signed the petition.

“We request the government to extend the tier-4 visas of all the international students by six months,” the petition said. This request was made for whoever joined any one-year PG course in September 2019.

The petition explained that all international students in the UK were paying huge fee for the postgraduate courses. “But, we are unable to use most of the university’s resources because of Covid-19. We are not delivered the value for money that we have paid. This is not the problem of students from just one university. It is a problem that every international student in UK has been facing. So, we believe that only government can help in this situation as the number of people getting affected is huge,” the petition said.

“We request you to waive the third term tuition fee as we are not able to use most of the university’s resources except online teaching,” it added.

Lalitha Sai is pursuing MSc International Business at the University of Nottingham, according to her Linkedin profile, and specialises in business strategies, accounting and lives in Nottingham, UK. She was earlier a systems engineer at Infosys and studied in Sathyabhama University, Tamil Nadu.

333,['17/05/2020'],No humidity boost for virus across most of India: Study,"Pune: A recent study by Indian Institute of Technology, Delhi, which linked absolute humidity with the spread of Covid-19, has also shown that a majority of states and territories fall outside the 'risky’ absolute humidity range in 2020.

Absolute humidity (AH) is the measure of water vapour (moisture) in the air, regardless of temperature. The researchers identified an AH range of 3 to 9 grams of moisture per cubic metre of air (g/m3) as 'risky' and a much narrower AH range of 4 to 6 g/m3 as 'very risky'.

Their findings have been published in 'Science of the Total Environment’, an international weekly peer-reviewed science journal.

The effect of these humidity ranges on infection spread has been termed as a 'weather-based spread'.

“Using existing and projected weather data for January-December, 2020, it was found that a majority of Indian states fall outside the 'risky' absolute humidity range throughout 2020,"" said Arnab Chanda, lead researcher from the Centre for Biomedical Engineering at IIT-Delhi.

“States and territories with some risk of weather-triggered spread are Sikkim, Jammu and Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh, Gujarat, Rajasthan, Chandigarh, and Haryana. Out of these, J&K and Sikkim fall in the 'very risky' absolute humidity range during January, February, March, November and December. One of the worst affected, Maharashtra, is not expected to experience any weather or humidity-triggered Covid spread anytime in 2020 due to its high humidity levels. But social distancing is crucial for states to claim this benefit,” Chanda said.

He added that in the monsoon period of June-September, 2020, none of the Indian states are likely to fall within the risky AH ranges. According to this analysis then the upcoming rainy season is not expected to impact the spread of Covid-19 in the country this year.

“However, the research showed that as absolute humidity starts to dip in some regions after the monsoon, some Indian states in the north may experience risk in terms of Covid-19 spread,"" Chanda said. ""But most other states, including Maharashtra, are projected to have absolute humidity levels above 9 g/m3 until the end of 2020.""

The researchers said absolute humidity is just one of the factors that determine rate of spread. While it is always beneficial for a region to have absolute humidity levels in the safe range, this benefit may account to naught if social distancing norms are not followed.

“The risky and very risky humidity ranges will help classify areas in different countries. They will help policymakers take steps to prevent weather-based Covid-19 spread in the upcoming months,” Sonal Gupta, another IIT-Delhi researcher involved in the study, said.

Some recent studies have shown that the spread of Covid-19 is expected to be stronger during colder and temperate weather, similar to the behavior of seasonal respiratory flu viruses and previous viruses from the Coronaviridae family (SARS-CoV-1 and MERS).

The IIT-Delhi researchers also identified risky weather ranges in the United States.

“We found that 90% of new cases in US — January to April — were reported when states were in the 'risky' AH range of 3-9 g/m3,” said Gaurav Raghuwanshi, second author of the study.

It has said that the government has backtracked on its assurances given during the negotiations following last year’s strike, when it was stated that unions will be consulted over any further move on corporatisation.

BMPS had actively taken part in the indefinite strike last year when the government had first announced its plans to corporatize the OFB. BPMS is a unit of Bharatiya Mazdoor Sangh (BMS), the trade union arm of RSS.

BPMS has said through a press release that the move was against the terms accepted during the negotiations as now a decision has been taken unilaterally.

In a meeting held on August 23 last year, following the strike, the government had assured that any decision on corporatisation will be taken after consulting the unions.

Mukesh Singh, the general secretary of BPMS, said there are plans to submit a memorandum to the government following which a protest may be held if the permission is secured.

335,['17/05/2020'],Mumbai couple rides 800km on scooter to Kutch,"Ashish Rathod and wife Jyoti

RAJKOT: Like most Mumbaikars , 30-year-old Ashish Rathod too preferred local trains for all travel purposes than rely on his scooter. The two-wheeler came handy only when he had to reach his shop from Nala Sopara, a town in Palghar district but part of Mumbai Metropolitan Region .

But on May 9, it was that very two-wheeler that ferried Rathod and his wife Jyoti through an arduous 800 km-long road journey from their house in Nala Sopara to their native Bhachau in Kutch .

The couple took a good 16 hours to reach Bhachau on May 10 with the only source of energy being a cup of tea offered to them by Bharuch police on the highway. “We had carried some food, but since I was riding at night, it could have made me feel sleepy,” Rathod told TOI.

“We had applied for permission to travel to Kutch and received the official pass on May 9. We did not think twice and immediately started our journey at 6pm,” said Rathod, who had earlier thought of hiring a cab. “As such I am facing cash crunch and I would have lost the advance paid to cab company had my application to travel got rejected. There was no public transport available and therefore I mentioned my scooter’s registration number in the form,” said Rathod.

Ashish has settled in Nala Sopara for the past 12 years and the couple got married two years ago. He is engaged in screen printing business and gets order from the bigger printers who make identity cards for schools. He gets job work done and peak business season is from April to October.

However, the nationwide lockdown dragged down his business and family’s income started drying up fast. “I used to pay a house of rent of Rs 5,000 per month and my monthly income was around Rs 25,000. But for the past two months, I had not earned anything,” he told TOI.

Moreover, his family in Bhachau was constantly anxious about the couple’s well-being after getting know about the daily spike of Covid-19 cases in Mumbai.

“All the highway hotels and restaurants were closed and the roads deserted. We took halts at few petrol pumps to take some rest and freshen up. Only a policeman offered us tea near Bharuch after checking our permit that was the only food we had.” he said.

The rise was explained by Jayanti Ravi, principal secretary (health & family welfare) as addition of 709 positive cases that Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) found from 6,587 tests conducted on vegetable or fruit vendors/grocers in past one week. “The cumulative figure has been added today to Ahmedabad's tally so that there is no discrepancy in data,” she said.But the explanation did not clarify several facts, pointed out experts. “AMC, which was providing daily list of cases in the category of ‘super spreaders,’ ceased to do so May 10 onwards.

In the bargain, the best offers are going out to domestic staffers to convince them to convert from part-time to live-in. The biggest premium is a higher salary, but other fancies thrown into the deal include the wifi password for data access, a movie during the weekend and a home visit every fortnight.The three phases of lockdown have clearly left women pining for the maids. While societies are still debating whether maids should be let in or not, some families are clear — they want to avoid the coming and going of bais.Anupam Sinhal of online maid agency Bookmybai said they have been getting at least 80 to 100 inquiries for live-in maids per day since the beginning of Lockdown 3.0. Sinhal said they placed as many as 45 live-in maids in the city on May 12.Priya Tandon, a Powai resident, said: “I had a live-in for several years but she got married and is now doing odd jobs at several homes. I’ve now approached her to join me temporarily till the air is clear on the lockdowns.”Many of Sinhal’s clients have also been requesting their part-time maids to work full-time. However, Sinhal, whose firm made around 2,000 calls on May 12 to part-time workers asking whether they would like to change, says only three agreed. “Not many maids are agreeing as they have their families, children and other obligations,” said Sinhal, who believes the situation might change when the part-time workers find themselves without jobs.Ankita Singh, a resident of Wadala who used to work in a mall toilet, is one of those willing to change. She grabbed the chance when a man from her slum who works as a security guard in a residential tower offered her a job to join a family as a live-in. “Close to 30 women of my area who were in malls and shops have been offered higher salaries by different homes in that society,” she said.“We also get Wifi connection to make a video calls to our families. We get some time off every day. And since we can’t step out, we will get to see TV every weekend,” she said with a smile.Another online domestic help provider Mychores.in has been getting almost 6 to 8 enquiries per day for live-in maids, chiefly from working couples across the city. “The demand for live-in help has been more or less consistent through the lockdown but it has gone up in the last week or so,” said Andrew V, founder and CEO, adding that they have been unable to meet the demand due to restrictions on the movement of domestic help.",mumbai,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-75783367,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-161047,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/city-woos-live-in-help-with-more-pay-wifi/articleshow/75783087.cms

Tea shops have been closed from March 25 to May 11 as part of restrictions during the lockdown. The shops were allowed to reopen with only take-away service. However, it has become a challenging for the tea shop vendors to follow the regulations.

Tea Stall Vendors Association district president S Rowthar Sha said that most of the customers preferred having tea or coffee at the stall instead of take-away. “They also demand paper cups instead of glasses out of fear of spread of infection.”

“Given the situation, as customers shy away from drinking tea and coffee in glass or stainless steel cups, we have no other option than opting for the banned paper cups,” said Sha.

“Lockdown has impacted our business a lot. The reopening of shops does not make any major difference because the take-away orders are very low as offices are yet to open fully,” said Sha, adding that Trichy has around 600 tea shops.

Association vice-president N Abul Hasan said that they had to face the wrath of the police if more than two customers are found in the shop at a time. “We are asking customers to step away from the shop and have their tea or coffee to avoid police action,” said Abul.

Meanwhile, food safety and drug administration department said that the vendors should not make it an excuse for bringing back paper cups. “This excuse cannot be accepted because paper cups are banned already. Properly cleaning glasses using dish washing soap will kill the virus, if any. Our action against the violation will commence shortly,” said designated officer of food safety department Dr R Chithra on Saturday.

“The mall ecosystem is critical to the economic revival and employment generation in manufacturing and retail sector. Malls act as the front end for 45% of India’s organised retail. Over 100 million jobs are directly and indirectly affected by the closure of malls,” the representation states.

In some areas such as Somajiguda, the outages were erratic – 15 to 20 minute power cuts through the day.

Working from home, the new norm among most employees these days turned out to be a struggle for many, owing to the prolonged power cuts.

According to Telangana State Southern Power Distribution Company Ltd (TSSPDCL), the disruptions were caused due to tree branches falling on power lines and cables snapping. Officials said as many as 110 electric poles and 10 transformers were damaged in the rain.

MSRTC launched this service on Friday night.This means that apart from Shramik Special trains, migrants can now get buses that will take them directly to other states. They will, however, have to pay from their pockets for travel outside Maharashtra.MSRTC managing director Shekhar Channe said, “We are sending a fleet of buses with migrants to Odisha. It will ferry them free of cost till the state border, after which the journey till their native villages will be chargeable.” Ten buses left for Odisha on Friday night with 200 migrants. Around 30 more are expected, said sources.The concept is simple—free rides are applicable till the state border (in accordance with funding approved by CM Uddhav Thackeray) and migrants have to hire the entire bus for onward journey for as much as Rs 44 per km. They have to pay for the to and fro ride after crossing the Maharashtra border, and this could come to anywhere between Rs 2,000 and Rs 3,000 per passenger, said sources.“Those who are willing to pay huge sums for trucks and tempos don’t mind paying for the bus travel which is secure and safe,” said an MSRTC official, adding there have been mishaps involving trucks, tempos and autorickshaws with migrants on highways.As a special facility to such passengers, MSRTC will also send a breakdown-maintenance van along, each bus will have two drivers and one official from the corporation who will pay for the diesel and show permits to officers at border check posts.Sources said the next lot of buses will go to villages in Andhra Pradesh. “We want to promote such services as these bring in additional revenue. We have an 18,000-strong bus fleet in Maharashtra but only 1,000 to 1,500 buses are running daily. A large number of buses are lying idle at our depots and we also have a huge manpower of 40,000 drivers and conductors who can be deployed for the special buses,” said Channe.RTO is working in tandem with MSRTC to stop the illegal plying of trucks with migrants. “We have caught 500 trucks and asked migrants to shift to MSRTC buses,” said a transport official.",mumbai,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-75785053,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1528309,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/for-a-price-state-buses-to-make-last-mile-drops/articleshow/75783092.cms

AURANGABAD: Marathwada has witnessed 231 farmers’ suicides from January to April during the current year, of which Beed district alone has reported 62 such cases.

The number of such incidents in the region, comprising eight districts, was 36 during the lockdown in April — lowest in the first four months of the year 2020.

As per official data, the eight districts reported 231 farmer suicides, of which 126 have been declared eligible for financial help and 32 ineligible. A decision on 73 cases is .

Aurangabad reported the second highest of 32 cases, Nanded and Osmanabad (30 cases ech), Latur 24, Parbhani 19, Hingoli 16 and Jalna witnessed 10 suicides.

Beed district collector Rahul Rekhawar on Saturday said the agrarian crisis and financial issues are the main reasons for suicides across the region. “We have total 25 cases pending for inquiry and necessary investigation into the same will be completed by the middle of next week,” he said.

In terms of month-wise break-up of incidents of farmer suicides in Marathwada , maximum 73 were reported in March, followed by 63 in January, 59 in February and 36 in April.

Veteran farmers leader Govind Joshi of Shetkari Sanghatana said the number of farmers’ suicides during the first four months of this year was relatively lower as compared to past years.

“The release of government aid into bank accounts of farmers under different relief and welfare measures has offered some relief to the peasant community. However, over 230 farmers losing lives in four months is still a matter of concern and needs official intervention,” he said.

Joshi said that the ill-effects of the lockdown on the farming sector and lives of farmers would start manifesting gradually. “The farmers have received a setback due to the lockdown as there is no expected returns for their produce,” he said.

Words such as isolation and containment , along with quarantine , will be definitive terms associated with the experience of the young.However, for thousands of elderly citizens in their 70s and 80s in the country, quarantine, without the term hardly ever used, was an essential part of their growing-up years; the disease they dreaded was small pox In the 1940s through the 1970s, Urwa Market , now incorporated within the city limits of Mangaluru, lay on the outskirts of the coastal town, and it was here that around 25 sheds were erected to house those suffering from small pox. A solitary shed still remains, a visible reminder of those terrifying times.The Karnataka state gazetteer , published in 1971 shows that the region was struck by cholera, small pox, malaria and many other fevers. Although cholera accounted for more fatalities, the administration quarantined only those who had small pox. “People in infected areas are inoculated, and are advised against entertaining relatives and friends. Most cases are coming chiefly from adjoining districts and Bombay,” the gazetteer noted. In 1945, the small pox epidemic claimed the lives of 254 in the erstwhile South Kanara district, while the number dropped to 49 in ’59, to 41 in ’60 before ultimately coming down to zero in ’70.Former corporator and secretary of Besant Institutions Devananda Pai, 68, recalled days from his boyhood when Urwa Market was forbidden territory. “A thrashing awaited us at home if we ventured there. Those who were quarantined were largely thought of as being on their deathbeds. Most people who were isolated did not reunite with families,” Pai added.Christine Lobo, who will turn 100 on June 24, recalled her father telling her about the epidemic sweeping through Kulashekar in 1890. “My father told me that small pox claimed lives every day in Kulashekar. The then parish priest Father Alexander Dubois, who presided over the final rites, would be forced to dig the graves himself when he could not find anyone to do so. Since I lived in Chikkamagaluru in the 1940s, I never caught small pox, though I have suffered from malaria,” Christine said.Jessy Castelino, 74, wife of former mayor PM Castelino, was a class VIII student when the small pox epidemic struck the district. “I lived in Kinnigoli, around 30km from Mangaluru.

One 65-year-old man who had no co-morbidities had only spent a day at Sola civil hospital. Sources claim that the victim had come at a critical state to the hospital.

“People still consider reporting the disease as a last resort.

359,['17/05/2020'],Village in Godhra stays locked down with a smile,"Motal village gave washable masks and sanitizers to its residents

VADODARA: While bigger cities might be struggling to implement the lockdown for Covid-19 in the right earnest, this village has no such issue. The residents have adopted to the restrictions well and the village panchayat is ensuring that they stay safe.

Motal village located about 20km from Godhra had started gearing up for Covid-19 ever since reports of the disease spreading outside China started coming in. When the lockdown was announced on March 25, those at the helm of affairs in Motal reacted swiftly.

The village already had CCTV surveillance and it ensured that all the entry points to the village were covered with the existing cameras. Strict monitoring of the feed of these cameras also done by officials and elected representatives of the panchayat.

Village sarpanch Ajaysinh Solanki said that those villagers who were settled elsewhere or had gone outside the village were also advised to avoid coming back. “They too understood the situation. We put barricades to ensure the main road leading to the village was closed,” Solanki said.

According to Solanki, the village was self-sufficient when it came to milk. “We identified a villager who had a three-wheel goods carrier for other purposes. He agreed to bring grocery and medicines after taking orders from our villagers. The villagers got things at their doorstep and he also got some money for the service he provided. He earned a bit despite the lockdown,” Solanki said.

The goods carrier owner Gopalsinh Solanki said that because the panchayat gave the work to him, villagers didn’t have to travel outside the villages for grocery and medicines. A couple of youths from the villages volunteered to help Solanki with the process.

The village gave washable masks and sanitizers to its residents. A part of the expense for this was borne by the panchayat and the rest by donors. Sanitizing of streets of the village was done twice so far. This was done once by the panchayat and once by the dairy cooperative of the village.

Even if the lockdown is lifted in the coming days, the only major concession that the village is looking to give is allowing its residents to come back if they are stranded outside the village. “We will ensure that they self-quarantine for two weeks,” said the sarpanch.

361,['17/05/2020'],"‘Micro management, planning are need of the hour for migrants’","Professor Sneha Deshpande is head of Nagpur University’s department of economics as well as director of its IQAC. She specializes in agricultural economics, gender economics and development studies. In a chat with TOI, she throws light on the exodus of migrants across the country.

Excerpts from the interview...

Q. What is the size of the internal migrant movement?

A. The 2017 Economic Survey of India estimates that the magnitude of inter-state migration in India was close to 9 million annually between 2011 and 2016. According to the 2011 Census, the total movement of internal migrants, inter and intra-state, was 139 million. Uttar Pradesh and Bihar are the biggest source states, followed closely by Madhya Pradesh, Punjab, Rajasthan, Uttarakhand, Jammu & Kashmir and West Bengal. Major destination states are Delhi, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Gujarat, Andhra Pradesh and Kerala. The internal migrant labourers migrate mainly due to the absence of employment opportunities.

Q. Could governments have handled the lockdowns and subsequent exodus better?

A. Yes, the problem could have been better handled by city administrations rather than waiting for a green signal from the Centre which should have been pushed to start transport facilities like Shramik trains by the second week of the lockdown. This would have saved migrants from a lot of pain. Beside it would have eased the pressure on civic authorities and NGOs who provided food to these workers during the lockdown.

Q. Why are migrants rushing back to their hometowns?

A. Migrant labourers were misinformed about Covid-19 and its possible dangers. They were only aware that there is some virus which can kill them. So, they believed, ‘Marna hai to ghar jakar marege’. They were also going home because they were told told ‘ghar me hi raho’.Where are their homes? Due to lockdown, suddenly they found themselves ‘beghar’ for which they were not prepared at all. Their psychological needs pushed them to be close to their near and dear ones. This was the main reason why migrant labours started travelling to their permanent homes. During the first lockdown, they received food and other help from their employer. However, during the second and third lockdowns, even the employer themselves were helpless due to loss in business and could not support these labourers. All levels of governments failed to plan the transfer of these migrants to their hometowns during the first lockdown, which could have helped to avoid many hardships to both the government and labourers.

Q. How will the absence of labourers from cities impact the economy?

A. Many industries in urban areas will face acute problems. They will either have to hire local labourers at a higher price or hire unskilled labour for skilled task requirements. These migrants may now prefer getting employment at a lower wage near their hometown rather than travelling to distant areas. Only a few are likely to return to their original workplace. Unless state governments implement a good policy to help the well-being of labourers during calamity, labourers will hesitate to travel to far off places. There is also a possibility that migrant labourers will go back to urban areas or their old employment after the economic activities restart.

Q. Should there be a separate policy to protect their interest in case of an emergency?

A. Yes, the videos on social media have drawn the attention on protecting the rights of migrant labourers who directly contribute towards industrialization and building smart cities. We treat them as a problem because they result in creation of slums in urban areas. The dual economy always persists in the phase of development. Policy planners have a huge responsibility to ensure that the interests of migrant labourers are protected.

Q. What’s the need of the hour?

A. Micro management and planning is the way out. Plan housing for labourers and lease them to industrialists, give tax incentives and maintain list of labourers with their bank accounts. NGOs and government administration must work in conjunction. Government-recognised placement agencies should be set up to maintain data. Payment should be fixed according to Minimum Wage Act and transferred directly to the labourer’s bank account. Vocational training is also important to create a skillset. Give more relaxations to employers if they employ labourers from local areas. Reforms in labour laws and decentralizing powers to provide amenities to the migrant population is important. Their basic human rights need to be preserved. States must follow the Kerala government model.

362,['17/05/2020'],Walk of history,"The Panjra toll booth on NH-44, also called the Mumbai-Jabalpur-Kolkata highway, is the gateway to north, east and west. Over the last few days, thousands have exited from here on different means of transport. TOI travels with the homebound up to Khawasa , the Maharashtra-Madhya Pradesh border point, to make sense out of this forced cavalcade

Nagpur: Even with the chattering in the background, there is an unexplained stillness. Under the hurriedly built shamiana at Panjra toll booth, about 15 kms from the iconic Zero Mile Stone in prosperous Nagpur, are distinct huddles marked by worried frowns.Three women are feeding their babies, pallus draped firmly over the head. Their older children are playing games on their own. Their husbands await some kind of advice. The youths among them have their own ideas. Behind the shamiana is the toll booth office. Nameless, faceless people have donated material for food which is cooked there itself by the condescending toll staff.Blue water coolers provide some solace from the mercury which is threatening to streak into the 40s. “Bhai, aa jao, nashta kar lo,” the man at the food counter hails out pleasantly to no one in particular.In another section of the shamiana, men wait in a queue that creeps forward ever so slowly. Covid distancing — however little — is ensured by their hastily filled, bulging 10 inch backpacks. A few volunteers in blue tees, which identify the NGOs they volunteer for, are conscientiously jotting down cell and identification numbers, and addresses on formatted papers. Details given, the numbers wait for empathy.It’s 9.30am today, yesterday and tomorrow. The scene is no different from an idyllic village anywhere in India.Within minutes, the locale changes. Like insects scurrying out of a disturbed ant hill, people arrive at the spot atop overburdened goods trucks, ready-to-collapse bicycles, two-wheelers from Neanderthal times, inside trailer-trucks with doors kept open for ventilation, pickup vehicles with hoods over its human contents, and any other motorable means.“How do we get to Gorakhpur from here? We have driven our two-wheeler from Karnataka and it has taken us four days. We cannot use Google maps as our cell phones have discharged. No, we don’t want to enter Nagpur city, some police harass us, though many are helpful,” says Rathod.After initially making people alight from trucks and trailers, police are indiscreetly now encouraging this mode of transportation. People do not want to be held back, don’t want to stand in queues don’t want to be shifted to shelters. The promise of free food, free bus or train travel, albeit with a minimum two-day layover, is not reassuring.“Truck drivers are charging us Rs2000 per person. As a group of five, we have hitchhiked from Bengaluru and are heading for different villages in Uttar Pradesh. We bargained for Rs800 per head. Forced to alight here, we are now looking for options. Is it true that trains are plying, can we board them,” asks Durgesh, his worn-out jeans unfashionably torn in many places.How did so many people reach the south of Vindhyas? Someone’s brother-in-law, an elder sibling, father, uncle initiated the movement, and the move. The chain extended, and many more ventured out to earn that extra income. Some earned Rs800 a day and managed to survive on Rs200. The rest were savings that were sent back home to needy and ailing family members. With lockdown, the cash in hand got exhausted. Where would the next meal come from?“These empty paint buckets hold all my possessions. My landlord did not throw me out but I didn’t have any money left. I registered for a train in Hyderabad where I worked but was told it would take 2-3 days. I can’t wait for so long when there is no guarantee,” says Pushpendra, who is heading to Kishanganj district in Bihar with five other friends. All their footwear, used by the affluent as bathroom slippers, is aged by several summers and unlikely to outlast Covid-19.A man and two women, benevolence overflowing, have just hailed down a trailer-truck little ahead. Packed in their hatchback are biscuit packets of a popular brand, khichdi, cold water, paper plates and glasses. Packed in the trailer are men, women, children and babies. The man takes a head count and stops, realizing the futility. The younger and fitter ones are accommodated on top of the trailer. Bedsheets and sari pallus give them meaningless protection from the sun.“Arre behenji, aap mat utro, yeh lo catch karo. Do you have any vessels, I can give you food, it will last till night, bahut hai, sab ke liye hai, koi bhookha nahin rahega,” says the man.Those walking with thailas, bags and paint boxes have set a furious pace. They are heading towards Bihar, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, Jharkhand, Bengal, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh . The distances they still have to cover are more than a thousand kilometres. They have already traversed between 500-800 kms. Their tone declares an inexplicable confidence. They can almost see their destinations on the near horizon.“We are cycling from Aurangabad; managed to buy three second-hand ones. We are heading to Katni (east MP). As masons, we earned a decent amount. Now there is no work,” says the youngest of the trio. “You are delaying us,” said the older one. On his cycle handle is an undergarment with holes in the unmentionables.A man is hawking belts and cheap goggles. He eyes the third of the Katni cyclists as a potential customer. The man’s apparently oversized pant — what is left of it — is held together by a tight coir string.On the blazing highway is a shirt, blouse, torn gamcha, a boy’s cap. Did they offer protection, or did they fly off while being air-dried to get rid of the sweat?At the point where the Bhandara slipway climbs to the highway, a few state transport buses are parked. There are some cops stopping the walkers and politely requesting those in trucks to board the buses which will take them free of cost to the Madhya Pradesh border. From there, they can board another bus to the next destination, and from there to the next…“I am going by this bus to the MP border. I have to get to Kolkata. I used to work in a factory in Nagpur. Oh, should I have been in a bus to Chhattisgarh,” asks Joy Sheel. In the same bus is Ibrar Ahmed and others who have come from Hyderabad and are on way to Balrampur in UP.Trucks and trailers are driving at Schumacher-speed. People are holding on for dear life. Some adventurers are making it exciting by hanging out from the half-shut ‘doors’. Guardedly trying to plot their way through are two auto rickshaws with their number plates and colour conveying their place of origin.“I have been plying this auto for five years now in Bengaluru. My friend and I are taking turns to drive. Four of us are on way to Madhubhani (Bihar). Since autos were not allowed to ply, there was no staying back. Once this settles, I will return as I have a loan to repay,” says Krishnadev, now fluent in Kannada. His three friends are in coloured singlets. Their feet and heads are trying to find space in the luggage-filled three-wheeler.“We are from Nalasopara (Mumbai). We didn’t have money to pay our landlord. So we decided to leave with my wife, two kids and two friends. We are carrying our own food,” says Yogendra Jaiswal, heading to Uttar Pradesh, clearly on the wrong route.The beautifully paved four-lane road with intermittent tollbooths is a pleasure to drive on. Unless one makes a mistake, mishaps will not happen. But the stretch has nothing to offer for shade. The trees have long been cut, legally and surreptitiously, when the road was widened. Under the only green seen for several miles, four dark, considerable specks sit crouched.“We are six of us and waiting for the other two lagging behind. We are coming from Hyderabad and going to Kishanganj (Bihar). The police put us on trucks, but the driver asked us to get off after some distance as we didn’t have the money he was demanding. We are trying to save whatever little we have for food. Many kind people did feed us along the way,” said Gopal. Their only belongings are in a cloth bag that many use to buy vegetables. The rest, or whatever is left of it, is on their bodies.Two-wheelers are aplenty on the stretch. None of them is on a joyride. Most vehicles hold a family of five and their personal wealth in huge sacks. The driver has barely enough space to manoeuvre the handles. A child is resting its head on them. Behind him is his wife. Between them is another kid. And behind them all is the mounted ‘samaan’. The lighter and modern ones zip past, the ancient ones snail.A moped made popular in the 80s by doodhwalas is shockingly still on the road. It is towing another of the same kind with a clothesline. There are women and children in this group.“We are going to Jalaun district in UP from Latur. The vehicle broke down on the way. I have been towing this for 50 kilometres now. There were women with us whom we managed to send ahead in trucks. We purchased these mopeds before the lockdown,” says Pradip Baharhal.More trucks, more trailers, more two-wheelers, more autos, more cars with number plates from different states are quickly scything their way through tiger-bearing Pench with no moment to stand and admire what is remaining of the forest on either side of the highway.At Khawasa, where Maharashtra meets Madhya Pradesh on this stretch, the travellers are made to alight. Those not going to districts of MP and parts of Uttar Pradesh are allowed to proceed in the same discomfort. Those from MP are made to stand in another queue for a medical check-up, and then yet another queue where their final destination is listed.The stretch from Khawasa to Nagpur has movement of empty trucks and buses, perhaps readying for more northward sorties for more Durgeshs, Rathods, Pushpendras, Joys and Krishnadevs. It appears as if half of north India was in south India, but is going back home. Or as far — and as close to home — as they can get.",nagpur,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-75783106,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-202971,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/walk-of-history/articleshow/75783107.cms

KOZHIKODE: It has been found that several Covid-19 patients in Wayanad had traveled extensively and it is going to be a daunting task for health authorities to trace their contacts.

Against this backdrop, district police have stepped in with an ‘ABCD model’ by putting to use the department’s technical and investigative capabilities to effectively implement contact tracing.

Police will prepare a separate contact list for each of the Covid-19 patient and will hand it over to the district administration for cross checking it with the list prepared by the health authorities.

According to district police chief R Ilango, four separate teams have been constituted for implementing the ‘ABCD model’. The A team will compare separate contact lists prepared by the district administration and the police and look for discrepancies.

The B team will provide backend support in preparing the contact lists. The C team will be made up of a separate contact tracing team, which will prepare distinct list for each patient, deploying technological and technical expertise. The D team, headed by the district police chief, will be the district-level interrogation team comprising two DSPs who will interrogate persons who go into hiding or withhold information or mislead authorities during contact tracing.

“The objective of the ABCD model is to enable quick and accurate contact tracing. The team will help district and health authorities in the contact tracing exercise and the separate contact list prepared by the police will be submitted to the district administration,” Ilango added.

The route maps of three policemen who tested positive for Covid-19, along with two patients belonging to the Koyambedu cluster, released during the last two days have shown extensive travel, covering several days.

For instance, the brother- in-law of the truck driver who has been running a shop at Panavalli has 64 primary contacts, including many tribespeople.

Also, the route maps of the two policemen shows extensive travel, with one policeman’s travel extending from April 28 to May 13, covering over 70 points, including Mananthavady police station, locations where he was posted, visit to a petitioner’s house, shops, etc.

The route map of the policeman from Kannur also shows wide travel from April 26 to May 13. He has been to various places, including Arakkal Palace, the residence of deceased NRK expatriate Arakkal Joy on his funeral day, along with visits to his house at Kelakam in Kannur, police station mess and multiple shops.

Additional SP (city) has been tasked to conduct a departmental investigation after the incident.

In the video, the boy could be seen crying uncontrollably and showing his swollen hand, claiming that two policemen had beaten him with a stick. The incident was reported from Sindhunagar locality under Baradari police station - a densely populated area. The boy's father sells vegetables outside his house and he sometimes joins him at work.

Harsh Gupta, the 12-year-old boy, said, “My father went for a bath. So, I was selling fruits in his absence. As I was dealing with a customer, two cops arrived on a bike. They then started hurling abuses at me and beat me with a stick.”

Harsh's father Umesh said, “The government has allowed selling of vegetables and fruits during Covid-19 lockdown, but don't know why the police keep harassing us. A few days ago, I was assaulted by local police outpost in-charge. Today, after seeing my son facing a similar harassment, I have made an official complaint on dial 112.”

Sanjay Gupta, an eyewitness, told TOI, “I felt really bad when I saw two policemen beating up this boy. The boy was only trying to support his father.”

Trying to put forth the cops' version, Bareilly SSP Shailesh Pandey said that prima facie it seems to be accidental as the police were trying to reprimand the crowd for not following social distancing norms and the boy was probably hit. He added that the boy was taken to a hospital and there was minor injury on his hand.

Sources said both the cops belong to 2018 batch and they told their seniors that they were only acting on a complaint that several people have gathered in the area and were not following the necessary guidelines.

367,['17/05/2020'],Tamil Nadu: Tasmac outlets reopen with better crowd control measures,"Representative image

TRICHY/MADURAI: There was another wave of rush by tipplers as the Tasmac outlets resumed business on Saturday in the central region following a Supreme Court directive.

Sale of liqour through Tasmac outlets in Madurai city was better organized on Saturday, when the shops were opened for the third time after lockdown. Although various measures such as token system, police crowd control were in place, it was low turnout that has helped in maintaining organized sale.

In Madurai, as many as 220 of the total 265 shops retail units opened on Saturday. The shops in containment areas and those without stocks did not open for business.

Tipplers were issued tokens. Officials said that only 70 tokens were issued for every hour. This has helped prevent jumping of queue and ensure social distancing. “We have been told to limit sales to 500 people in each store. However, customers were allowed to purchase any number of bottles,” he said.

K Manikandan, a resident of Sellur, said that though he was happy that Tasmac shops were opened again, unavailability of beer was a disappointment.

Meanwhile, in Trichy , Tasmac has opened 150 of the 183 shops in the district. Customers started crowding from the morning. Tokens printed in seven colours for seven days were issued to customers by 10 am. The shops remained open till 5 pm for the token holders for Saturday. Police personnel deployed at shops were busy regulating crowds. Even then, social distancing could not be followed in some of the shops. Barricades were put up in front of all the shops to maintain social distancing. But, people cramped up together while waiting with the tokens for entering the barricade queue.

Tasmac elite shops also witnessed long queues. Unlike on May 7, chairs and shades were not provided to the tipplers to wait in the queue in Trichy on Saturday. Several shops closed the sale by afternoon as all the 500 tokens for each shop were used by the tipplers. Police also used public addressing systems to regulate the crowd.

There was no cap on the quantity of liquor. However, Tasmac officials said that they were not allowing bulk purchase. A senior official said that the 33 shops fell under 19 containment zones in the district. Reopening of these shops was ruled out.

Customers alleged that their repeated representations and grievances were unheard.

Technical snag in the servers in post offices has become common in the postal department, particularly in the sub-post office in Woraiyur in Trichy city as the server was down for nearly two years.

Customers are often raising the issue with the postmaster concerned and other staff, however, the postal employees themselves are clueless about how the problem could be resolved. Payments such as Kisan Vikas Patra, monthly income scheme, recurring deposits (RD), senior citizen savings scheme, national savings certificates, Sukanya Samridi Yojna and time deposits are affected due to the server problem.

Customers are forced to wait for at least 15 to 30 minutes and their payments printed during their next visit to the post office, said a customer who has RD accounts with the Woraiyur post office. The employees say that the server problem has remained unsolved for nearly two years.

Sources in the postal department said that BSNL is the primary service provider and Sify Technologies Limited is a secondary service provider, which is also acting as a mediator for BSNL and the postal department. “For any queries, authorities concerned from the postal department have to first contact Sify. Then they would take the issue to the BSNL and then they would attend the issue”, a senior official from the postal department said.

President of TNCCI, N Jegatheesan said the government should realize the impact of the exodus of these workers at one stroke from industrial states like Tamil Nadu.

“This migration is something that could not be stopped. These workers are an important part of many industries in states like Tamil Nadu and their leaving could affect them. For example, rice mills which were an essential commodity continued to run throughout the lockdown period to meet the demand because these guest workers were given accommodation on their work premises, and they were ready to work continuously. Their role in loading and deloading is big, and they were easier to manage than local workers,” he said. But, as many of them from Bihar, Odisha, Assam, West Bengal, Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh had expressed their willingness to return, the industries allowed them to go.

Meanwhile, the chamber applauded Union finance minister. Nirmala Sitharaman’s diverse proactive and efficacious schemes unbundled in the last two days. “MSME is the backbone of our economy and the minister has suggested path-breaking liquidity The announcement of Rs 3 lakh crore for collateral-free automatic loans to the extent of 20% of their existing loan for businesses, including MSMEs, will solve to a great extent the problem of liquidity crunch of this sector to make their units operative after lockdown,” he said.tnn

KOLKATA: The depression over southeast Bay of Bengal intensified into a cyclone on Saturday and is set to develop into a severe cyclonic storm — Amphan — over the next 24 hours that could lash the east coast on May 20. While moderate to heavy rainfall has been predicted along the coastal areas of Bengal, Kolkata could receive heavy showers next Wednesday, accompanied by wind blowing at a speed of 70km/hr. Cloud and rain , however, may strike the city by the second half of Monday.

Amphan stood at a distance of 1,220km south-southwest of Digha on Saturday morning. It moved at a speed of 20km/hr in the north-west direction. According to the Regional Meteorological Centre (RMC), it will continue to move in the same direction and then recurve in the north-northeast direction towards the Bengal coast.

“It is still too early to predict where it will hit land but we expect landfall in the second half of May 20. While the cyclone could weaken before hitting land, the impact on Kolkata will be the maximum as it enters land. The city could receive heavy rain till the first half of May 21,” said RMC director GK Das.

Along with Kolkata, all south Bengal districts will receive moderate to heavy rainfall from Tuesday, a day before Amphan hits land. “While the coastal districts could receive very heavy rain, all south Bengal districts will be lashed by moderate to heavy showers on May 20. Wind speed could touch 85km/hr in the coasts with gusts of 100 km/hr,” added Das.

Most of these cases are confined to some clusters, a feature which is absent in north and central Kolkata Covid zones. In south, standalone buildings, rather than the slums (except in select areas), have become Covid hotspots, said a section of KMC officials.According to KMC headquarters and Lalbazar sources, there are now about 140-odd containment zones lying between wards 61 and 144 that cover the entire length of south Kolkata and the added areas. While south and its added areas comprising 84 wards have 140 containment zones, only 60 north and central Kolkata wards have 146 such zones. More than the number of containment zones, the situation in north and central Kolkata is worrying in terms of number of cases and their geographical spread.The good news is that when compared to central and north, where merely one ward at present has no active Covid cases, there are 17 such wards — in Tollygunge , Jadavpur and Behala West — that have no active cases. Four more wards — most importantly one in Parnasree that had reported the very first cases of Covid in southwest Kolkata — are now in the green zone.“At least three containment zones in Behala and Haridevpur — Diamond City South , BL Saha Road and Sakherbazar — are now in the green zone. There are merely 13 active cases in Behala that has a poulation of 10.5 lakh.

Garden Reach and Metiabruz have added 38 new cases in the past 10 days. Added to this, one-off containment zones have sprung up in Anandapur-Mukundapur.

As expenses have to be cut down during the crisis period, they had decided to shut down some of their offices in the cities and make their employees continue to work from home.

A Premkumar who runs a digital design firm, says he is rethinking the way in which he and his five employees function. “I have been able to get things done remotely. And now as the business has been dull during the last two months, and is indicative of how it would be in the next few months, I have decided to give up my office and continue to work from home,” he said. This entrepreneur pays Rs 15,000 as rent and when other overheads like electricity and water are included it goes up to Rs 22,000. By giving up his office he could save nearly that amount. “I have asked a friend of mine if we can use a small room in his large office once a week for a meeting with my colleagues, and that would suffice,” he said.

Commercial spaces were acquired for a rent ranging from Rs 50 to Rs 60 per square feet in many parts of Madurai. If it was a posh locality like Chokkikulam or K K Nagar it would go up to Rs 90 per square feet. A 2,000 square feet office will cost not less than Rs 40,000 per month. Many of them are rethinking this usage. ``Now, my building owner is offering me a 30% concession but I still don’t need it,’’ said T Shankar, an entrepreneur.

K Pandi, a broker, says that there are many buildings coming up for rent in Anna Nagar, K K Nagar and Iyer Bungalow in the city. The owners are quoting a lesser by about Rs 10,000 compared to the rent, last year. “However, I haven’t got many enquiries for office spaces in the last two months and my business has been completely dull,” he said.

R K Jeyabalan, executive director of Consortium for Technology Research Entrepreneurship and employment, says, “If it involves a project with sensitive data, it cannot be done remotely. Product development issues need coordination within an office.”

Several migrant workers were in the truck that had a Haryana registration number.Police officials present at the spot refused to speak to the media and said they should talk to the district administration regarding this.SSP Grover told TOI that the migrant labourers were “spotted” inside the truck during a check near Jait police station. “So they were being taken in the same truck from Jait area to Kosi mandi where buses had been arranged for their transportation to their respective districts as no other vehicle was available,” he said.

378,['17/05/2020'],"HP man misses train, cops rush him to next stn","Carambolim: Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge’s iconic railway station scene was set to be recreated as the Shramik Special train bound for Una, Himachal Pradesh, pulled out of the Karmali railway station on Saturday— except, instead of Simran, it was Mohan Rana, 42, who was chasing the train with two bags.

With no Shah Rukh Khan to help him, it was left to state authorities to ensure that Rana did not miss the train.

Rana, who had a permit to travel to HP, reached just two minutes late, running onto the platform just as the train was being flagged off by North Goa collector R Menaka and North Goa SP Utkrisht Prasoon. Even as Rana spilled his near-miss story, the authorities decided to pull out all stops to ensure that the man and his two bags made it onto the train. Menaka ordered Konkan Railway officials to make a ticket for the Kangra district resident while police used its vehicle to rush the man to the next stop— Tivim railway station where he was put onto the train home.

“I heard about the train just some time ago and I came here as fast as I could,” said Rana.

Menaka said that the train’s passenger manifest would be updated with Rana’s details and sent to the HP government. “It so happened that one person reached quite late so we have arranged for him to depart from the Tivim railway station in consultation with the railway authority,” said Menaka.

The train with 582 passengers will arrive at Una after a two-day journey. This is the second train to Himachal Pradesh. Rana was not the only one to be accommodated at the last minute. Authorities held up the train beyond its scheduled departure time just so that Upendra Uraon, a bartender at a Sinquerim nightclub, could make it.

“I found out about the train just one hour before the departure time, around 5pm,” said Uraon, who grabbed his bag and documents and rushed to the station even as police kept tabs on his movement from Sinquerim. “I got so many calls fromofficials while on my way that I was confident that the train would not leave without me,” he said.

With the state doing all it can to ensure that the passengers reach home, the station resounded with words of gratitude as the train left. While some yelled, ‘Goa Police is the best’ others shouted ‘Thank you Goa’. “The intention was to assist all those who wanted to leave. Though the scheduled time of departure was 6pm we got calls from the Himachal Pradesh government saying that they have issued permits to some people at the last minute, and they asked us to facilitate their travel. So we held the train for some time,” said Menaka.

LUCKNOW: The UP State Road Transport Corporation has provided buses in various districts, on written request from the DMs concerned, to drop migrants -- who are walking or stranded -- to their destinations. The buses have been made available at the pick-up points on district borders.

As per the arrangement, migrants entering the district are first taken to shelter homes by the district administration through these buses.

“In another arrangement, we have directed our drivers and conductors that while coming back after dropping migrants to their destination, when you see other migrants walking on foot, make them board empty buses and drop them at pick up points on district borders,” said UPSRTC MD Raj Shekhar.

“That way, we will save them from walking some extra kilometres,” said the official. The district administration team at pick up points will further help migrants reach their homes. The buses would drop those walking on foot closest to the district they are heading.

KOLKATA: The Council for the Indian School Certificate Examinations (CISCE) has decided to introduce project work in Mathematics and English in the Class XII ISC board examination in this academic session (2020-21) instead of the next academic year (2021-22).

Students appearing in the ISC examination next year will have to prepare projects for the two papers for 20 marks. The theory papers in each subject will be for 80 marks.

The list of various topics that candidates can choose for their projects in the two subjects has been sent to school principals. The ISC English paper I will consist of listening and speaking skills of 5 marks each, which will be evaluated in internal assessment.

The speaking skill test will include narrating an experience, giving a report or expressing an opinion or theme-based conversation.

For example, students can narrate an incident from their childhood days or speak on a school event. Students can also express their opinions on topics like online learning.

While testing their writing skills, 5 marks each will be allotted for internal and external assessment.

“Students may write about the day they learnt the value of punctuality. Review of a TV serial can be favourable or unfavourable,” council chief executive and secretary Gerry Arathoon explained in the letter to the school heads.

In ISC English paper-II, examinees may have to analyse the theme of any story or poem from the prescribed texts, a character from the plays, short stories or poems in the prescribed texts, summarize or paraphrase a story or a poem, an alternative outcome to any of the chosen texts or comparison of two characters from two different texts.

In mathematics paper II project work, which will be of 20 marks, candidates will be expected to have completed two projects from any topic covered in Theory.

St James School principal T H Ireland said, “Candidates will now have less stress as theory paper will for just 80 marks. Overall subject marks will also improve because of the project works.”

AHMEDABAD: The state education board will declare the results of Class XII (science) board exams online on Sunday.

The marksheets of candidates will be posted on the official website of the Gujarat Secondary and Higher Secondary Education Board (GSHSEB), according to a press statement.

The exam results are usually declared in the first week of May. For the past many years, the Class XII (science) exam results were declared along with Gujarat Common Entrance Test (GUJCET) results.

“The physical marksheets for Class XII students will be handed over at a later date,” said a board official.

As many as 1.43 lakh candidates took the Class XII (science) exams. About 8,000 teachers took part in the evaluation process, held during the lockdown, across 57 exam-paper checking centres.

On Saturday, the state government erroneously issued a press statement congratulating students for their performance in the Class XII (science) exam. The error was rectified after the government issued a fresh statement saying that the results will be declared on Sunday.

The board had earlier released the provisional answer keys for multiple-choice questions for Class X, Class XII (science) and Class XII (general) board exams. The answer keys have been put on the board’s official website.

“For the biology Class XII (science) exam paper, if there were two correct answers for the multiple-choice questions, students who have chosen any one of them will be given full marks,” according to a board official.

A merit list for the candidates is drawn up by giving 40% weightage to percentile in GUJCET and 60% weightage to percentile in Class XII (science) board exams.

“The new date for conducting GUJCET is yet to be finalized,” said a source in the state government.

More than 1.25 lakh students from across the state are expected to take GUJCET.

The state-level exam is held annually for science students seeking admissions in degree engineering and pharmacy courses in government, grant-in-aid, and self-financed engineering institutions in Gujarat.

HYDERABAD: Sukanta Manikpuri and her family walked 160 km from Nagole to NH-44 in hope of finding a ride back to their home in Chhattisgarh ’s Bilaspur. On the way, some travellers had told them that there were trucks ferrying people for free. But their hopes shattered, when were told to cough up Rs 1,500 each for a seat in crammed vehicle - only to reach the Maharashtra border.

“It’s very expensive. We are carrying the last of our savings to buy food for our children. We have no choice but to walk now,” said the construction labourer, when TOI caught up with his family of six near Dichpally on the national highway. Right in front of Sukanta, was her six-year-old daughter trudging along with her two-year-old sibling in her arms. The father, Govind Manikpuri, held on to their third child walking next to this brother.

“We were really hoping to find help here since a few people who were also walking told us there is a possibility of getting a truck near Nizamabad. But since they are asking for money, we are left with no choice but to walk,” said Govind adding, “We have another 800 km to cover.”

But despite the struggle, the family is determined to make it back to their village. “If we stay, my children will die of hunger,” said Sukanta sharing their story of misery. “We (the three adult members) lost our jobs soon after the lockdown. With our meagre savings we somehow managed till the the second week of May. Now, we are down to our last few rupees,” she added, in between adjusting the weight — of some clothes and other belongings — on her head. The family spent a week enquiring about the public transport and free truck rides, but found none.

“After the government started trains, we got our names registered but we never received any information about when we can travel. We enquired a lot about buses and other public transport too, but nothing was running,” said Govind.

Although some buses were arranged within the city to pick up migrant workers and drop them at railway stations, the authorities have not made any arrangements for inter-state travel yet. Principal secretary of transport department, Sunil Sharma said, “We have arranged buses to take them ( migrants ) to the railway station but it is within the twin cities. Since trains are running, arranging buses from here will be very difficult during the lockdown.”

The commission has sought an action taken report from the district magistrate in three days.

This is the second time in a span of two weeks that the NCPCR has issued a notice to Agra administration for death of children due to medical negligence.

In his latest complaint, child rights activist Naresh Paras had said a six-month-old son of Surendra, a resident of gram panchayat Nagla Anandi under Malpura police station, was suffering from a stomach ache, fever and other medical complications. His parents contacted 108 ambulance and police but did not receive any assistance.

“The family lost their baby while walking 10 km to a government hospital as no ambulance responded to their distress call. The child could have been saved had the ambulance reached on time,"" he added.

The NCPCR notice added that similar cases had come in the commission’s notice previously. ""You are, therefore, again requested to look into the matter on an urgent basis and make necessary arrangements so that children receive timely medical assistance whenever required in the lockdown period.""

Paras hoped that stern action would be taken against those responsible for the death of the children.

The activist pointed out that due to the lockdown, the medical system in Agra had completely collapsed for non-Covid-19 patients. Since April, at least, five children had died in the city due to unavailability of timely medical assistance. Though the district administration had ordered a probe, it had failed to take action, he said.

In April, at least four cases of gross medical negligence surfaced in Agra, where non-Covid child patients were denied treatment by private and government hospitals.

On April 22, a pregnant woman who went into labour was allegedly denied admission in at least two private hospitals. After over six hours, she was admitted at the district woman’s hospital. By that time, the fetus had died in the womb.

On April 24, an ailing 12-year-old boy died after he was allegedly turned away by six private hospitals.

The third incident happened on April 29, when three private hospitals allegedly refused to treat an eight-month-old baby. When his family took him to SN Medical College, too much time was wasted in filling up forms for admission, and the delay cost the boy his life.

On May 5, an eight-day-old girl suffering from fever died on way to the district hospital after allegedly being turned away by six private hospitals. The child's father claimed that 10 hours were wasted on going from one hospital to another.

Potassium permanganate is a purplish-black crystalline solid. It is diluted in water and kept in two separate containers for dipping the hands and feet. Officials said the chemical is available for less than Rs 300 per kg in market, which is sufficient for at least three months. It disinfects bacteria, algae, fungus and most of the viruses. It also helps in healing wounds and skin problems caused by fungal and bacterial infection, they said.

Designated officer for food safety, Madurai district, Dr M Somasundaram said that some of the appalam units spread out in various parts of the city like Chinna Anupanadi, Mela Anupanadi, Jaihindpuram and Kamarajarpuram have already started using it and others will follow soon. Since it can be used by all FBOs, they are going to insist the hotel industry to implement it. “The chemical can be used for dipping plates and tumblers after washing with water to ensure disinfection. Some of the big hotels are already using it,” he said. P S Kathikeyan of Madurai Meenakshi Appalam said that just two to three grams of potassium permanganate is enough for 10 litres of water, hence it is cost-effective too.

LUCKNOW: After a spate of accidents involving migrant workers over the past week, the latest being when at least 26 persons lost their lives in a crash in Auraiya, chief minister Yogi Adityanath has issued strict instructions to prevent any unauthorised movement of people and vehicles in the state.

“The CM has directed that any vehicle, truck, bus, tractor etc which is caught ferrying passengers illegally, will be confiscated while the drivers will be challaned. Anyone found walking, cycling or travelling in such vehicles will be taken to the nearest quarantine centre, scanned for Covid-19 and then taken home, unless they need to be quarantined,” said additional chief secretary (home) Awanish Awasthi.

Chief secretary RK Tiwari said entry of any migrant would be banned if travelling on foot or in an unauthorized mode of transport.

Emphasising that the government was bringing back people to the state and then taking them back to their home districts for free, the CM once again appealed to people to show patience and wait for the government to bring them back safely.

For those who reach the UP border, arrangements have been made to feed them and then take them to the nearest quarantine shelter. From there, once they are tested, they will either be taken home if they are well or housed in institutional quarantine if they display any symptoms of corona virus.

District magistrates of areas along the state border have been directed to keep at least 200 buses and private vehicles available so that nobody is allowed to walk back home. These buses should be made available to those migrant workers who are arriving at the state border.

“The government has made arrangements to bring back people safely. Already, 450 trains have arrived in UP, bringing back 5.64 lakh people. Another 88 trains arrived in UP on Saturday while permission has already been issued to another 286 trains to bring back another 3.85 lakh persons,” Awasthi said.

Out of the trains that have already arrived, 223 have come from Gujarat, carrying about 3 lakh people, 97 from Maharashtra bringing back 1.20 lakh persons, 78 from Punjab with 90,000 people, 12 from Rajasthan, six from Telangana, five from Kerala and four from Tamil Nadu. Two each have also come from Andhra Pradesh, Goa and Madhya Pradesh.

Meanwhile, directions have also been issued to strengthen community surveillance at the rural and urban levels. The CM has said that using the CM helpline, calls should be made to the newly constituted nighrani committees and details of those who have returned taken down. Ultra-red thermometers should also be made available in each village.

With the CM having promised jobs for even 50 lakh people, he has asked officials to explore possibilities for job creation under the Jal Jeevan Mission. He also said that there are several possibilities of employment at cow shelters and in the upcoming large scale plantation drive that is to take place.

AGRA: Hours after 26 migrant labourers were killed in a road accident in Auraiya, the UP government sought written explanations from the ADG (Agra zone), IG (Agra range), Agra SSP, and SSP and ASP of Mathura, ordering the suspension of two SHOs posted at the border.

Fatehpur Sikri SHO Bhupinder Singh Balayan has already been suspended, while the Kosi Kalan SHO's suspension is pending.

A few hours before the accident, chief secretary Rajendra Kumar Tiwari had asked the state administration to ensure that the migrant labourers coming into the state on trucks, foot and on two-wheelers were to be stopped and facilitated with private & school buses to take them to their respective destinations.

“The migrant labourers hired a truck (DCM) from Makanpur in Indirapuram police limits of Ghaziabad district and travelled via expressway to reach Auraiya passing through Mathura, Agra, Firozabad , Etawah and other districts. We have to see why Mathura and Agra policemen were held responsible for the unfortunate tragic event,” a senior official said.

Another official said, “Neighbouring states are also creating nuisance for us by pushing migrant labourers into UP. On May 10, a team of Rajasthan police led by an SHO from Bharatpur district had scuffled with Mathura policemen at the border when UP policemen prevented the migrant labourers from entering the state. Later, Bharatpur police diverted the migrant labourers via Agra.”

According to initial police investigation into the Auraiya accident, the second truck ferrying a handful of migrant labours were pushed into UP from Bharatpur via Fatehpur Sikri.

A senior cop said, “The truck crossed Agra at 8 pm and was in Kanpur zone for several hours on the roadside where the accident occurred. Auraiya police should have taken action. They also have a night patrolling team. The Auraiya district administration too could have sealed their border to avoid migrant labourers’ movement. ”

A source added, “Passes of vehicles are being issued by the transport department. It’s their duty to check the movement of such vehicles.”

397,['17/05/2020'],Finding a formula to set box office ringing,"CHENNAI: For many, sitting in a multiplex with a favourite flavoured popcorn was a way to unwind, experience the magic of storytelling or have a day out with family. But after the Covid-19 scare, moviegoing may not be the same as uncertainty looms over how the entertainment industry can get back to business.

Behind the scenes, the lockdown has served an extreme blow to the Tamil film industry which began on a low this year with not many films recording a good box office run. The brisk business for theatres during the months of April and May because of summer vacations is lost this year. And it has now become a question of survival for many in Kollywood. Right from the daily wage workers to big stars, all seem to have lost the plot because of the looming uncertainty over resumption of shooting and cinema going. At the last session of The Times of India virtual conclave, Making TN Future Postive, experts discussed how support from the government, along with the right formula adopted by the industry, could revive the entertainment sector.

While the state government has partially given a go-ahead for many businesses to begin their activities gradually, this sector still has a long way to go.

Abirami Ramanathan, president of Chennai city film exhibitors’ association, said the Centre should not impose GST at least for three to four years till normalcy returns. ""The state government should withdraw the LBT (local body entertainment tax) which is another 8% tax over the GST. A ticket which should cost around Rs150, but it is unnecessarily jacked up to Rs205 because of LBT. We must make the public come to theatres. The state should give us a single window clearance for converting big theatres into five small theatres.""

Actor-politician Khushbu said though the entertainment industry is the largest taxpayer, it gets the least recognition from the Centre. ""With no pension, no schemes and no insurance. We must fend for ourselves. If as an industry we are generating so much revenue. We should be reciprocated in the same way.""

Taking it forward, Senthil Kumar, co-founder of Qube Cinema said, ""The government should use this opportunity to do things in a way to save the cinema industry. The central government should have a level-playing field between OTT and theatres freeing us from censorship. We could have voluntary censorship, where we take a call on what can be viewed by children and others.""

Echoing Ramanathan’s views, BOFTA dean G Dhananjayan said motivating the audience is key. ""We need to bring the audience back to the theatres. The state government must cut taxes. Theatre owners should cut down prices of snacks and beverages. Similarly, producers must not burden theatre owners. Everybody should play their role to beat the crisis and come out in flying colours.""

MADURAI: Five people including three teenage boys were arrested by the Tuticorin district police on charges of sexually harassing and threatening a 17-year-old girl that resulted in the girl attempting self-immolation at her house on May 9. The girl, who was badly injured on her neck and chest, is undergoing treatment at the Thoothukudi government medical college hospital.

Superintendent of Police (SP) of Tuticorin district Arun Balagopalan said that four of the accused V Saravakumar, 27, M Velsamy, 29, K Udayakumar, 19, and V Karuppasamy, 19, of Puliyankulam village were produced before the Vilathikulam judicial magistrate and lodged in the Tuticorin district jail in Perurani. A minor boy in the gang was produced before the juvenile justice board and taken to the home for children in conflict with the law in Tirunelveli.

The victim was subjected to repeated sexual harassment and threats to her life over phone by the accused. Unable to bear with their harassment she turned off her mobile phone on May 8. The same night, the accused went to her house, shouted at her for turning off her mobile phone and threatened to set her ablaze if she did not go to the place where they wanted her to come on May 9.

Frightened over the threats the girl attempted self-immolation but was saved and rushed to the Thoothukudi government medical college hospital. Video of the girl from the hospital narrating the harassment went viral in the social media. Based on a complaint lodged by her mother, Kulathur police registered a case under various sections of the POCSO Act, IPC and Tamil Nadu Prohibition of Harassment of Woman Act.

MUZAFFARNAGAR: After an inspection revealed that a contractor, holding an expired licence, was providing ‘poor quality’ food at a quarantine centre, two UP ministers sought a reply from district magistrate Mahender Prasad on the state of quarantine centres across the district and how money is being spent on it. There are more than 20 quarantine centres in Muzaffarnagar district.

The two ministers who sought details are Muzaffarnagar’s BJP MP and minister of state of animal husbandry, dairy and fisheries Sanjeev Balyan , and state minister Kapil Dev Aggarwal.

Notably, tehsildar Pushkar Nath Chaudhry, who was posted at Sadar tehsil, was suspended after the incident came to light.

Speaking to TOI, Balyan, said, “I received a reply from the administration, which revealed that Rs 40 lakh was spent on food across the quarantine centres. After the clarification, it seems that there is no scam while purchasing food for the quarantine centres, but an inquiry is still on the procedure of tender given to the company whose licence had expired in February.”

According to sources, the contractor managed to get the tender to supply food at quarantine centres across Muzaffarnagar, despite having an expired licence.

Balyan said the matter is being probed by the additional district magistrate (finance) and promised action against whoever responsible for the negligence.

HYDERABAD: Several activists, volunteers and denizens have voiced concerns about the non-transparent mechanism while issuing passes and arranging trains for the homebound migrant workers. In a letter written to chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao, these groups, working under the umbrella of Advocacy Covid-19 Lockdown Collective, said that complicated processes and inordinate delays have only compounded the misery of the migrants .

“Our collective experience in the past one week has been that, compared to the actual requirement and requisition, fewer trains have run and there are still a large number of workers who are awaiting return,” reads the letter.

The letter also highlights several issues faced by the helpless migrants. “Limited registration of only 200 persons per day per police station, lack of clear guidance, transparency, delays and uncertainty in the process of issuing of movement pass, inadequate information available with ground staff and police...the uncertainty of local travel from the site of the worker till the railway station, disowning of responsibility by contractors to provide food and shelter since the Shramik special trains have begun,” are some of the issues mentioned in the letter.

The letter also provides some suggestions for streamlining the return of migrant workers. Recorded step-by-step video and audio instructions in Hindi, Odiya, Bangla etc, and wider dissemination of information would be helpful for the migrants. The need of the hour is proper co-ordination with states like Odisha and Chhattisgarh to send the migrants on TSRTC buses.

According to the letter, workers must be provided with the train and bus schedules at least two days in advance. The state government must come up with a long term ‘Telangana Migrant Workers Action Plan’ at the earliest since a number of workers have lost livelihoods and are staring at poverty, says the letter.

Denizens have also appealed to the government to universalize dry ration delivery, through PDS, at least for the next six months.

GUNTUR: Taking advantage of the government’s decision to unfreeze restrictions on transport of horticulture and agriculture commodities, bootleggers tried to smuggle huge stocks of liquor from Telangana to AP on Saturday.

However, their luck ran out when Guntur rural police intercepted the watermelon-laden trucks soon after they entered the state from Pondugula inter-state check-post in Gurazala sub-division.

The police grew suspicion when the truck drivers failed to provide details of the farmers who loaded the watermelons. They made the drivers unload the stock, leading to the seizure of 2,330 liquor bottles from the three trucks. “The price of the liquor stock seized from the trucks would be around Rs 4 lakh,” Gurural SP Ch Vijaya Rao told TOI. Four persons, including the drivers of the three vehicles, were arrested.

The SP further said that 25 others involved in the smuggling of liquor were arrested on Friday during searches held at various places in Sattenapalle and Gurazala sub-divisions. The special teams also seized liquor stock worth another Rs 6 lakh from the possession of the accused.

“We have stepped up surveillance at all the inter-state border points. We have set up 21 check-posts to prevent the illegal transport of liquor from the neighbouring state. Around 14 mobile teams, eight district border teams and five inter-state border teams have been formed to curb liquor smuggling,” said Vijaya Rao, adding that 11 vehicles used for the illegal transport of liquor have also been seized. He warned that they would not spare anyone involved in the smuggling of liquor.

405,['17/05/2020'],Tasmac outlets reopen with better crowd control measures,"Trichy/Madurai: There was another wave of rush by tipplers as the Tasmac outlets resumed business on Saturday in the central region following a Supreme Court directive.

Sale of liqour through Tasmac outlets in Madurai city was better organized on Saturday, when the shops were opened for the third time after lockdown. Although various measures such as token system, police crowd control were in place, it was low turnout that has helped in maintaining organized sale.

In Madurai, as many as 220 of the total 265 shops retail units opened on Saturday. The shops in containment areas and those without stocks did not open for business.

Tipplers were issued tokens. Officials said that only 70 tokens were issued for every hour. This has helped prevent jumping of queue and ensure social distancing. “We have been told to limit sales to 500 people in each store. However, customers were allowed to purchase any number of bottles,” he said.

K Manikandan, a resident of Sellur, said that though he was happy that Tasmac shops were opened again, unavailability of beer was a disappointment.

Meanwhile, in Trichy, Tasmac has opened 150 of the 183 shops in the district. Customers started crowding from the morning. Tokens printed in seven colours for seven days were issued to customers by 10 am. The shops remained open till 5 pm for the token holders for Saturday. Police personnel deployed at shops were busy regulating crowds. Even then, social distancing could not be followed in some of the shops. Barricades were put up in front of all the shops to maintain social distancing. But, people cramped up together while waiting with the tokens for entering the barricade queue.

Tasmac elite shops also witnessed long queues. Unlike on May 7, chairs and shades were not provided to the tipplers to wait in the queue in Trichy on Saturday. Several shops closed the sale by afternoon as all the 500 tokens for each shop were used by the tipplers. Police also used public addressing systems to regulate the crowd.

There was no cap on the quantity of liquor. However, Tasmac officials said that they were not allowing bulk purchase. A senior official said that the 33 shops fell under 19 containment zones in the district. Reopening of these shops was ruled out.

406,['17/05/2020'],Chennai News - Times of India,"CHENNAI: Van Goghs are now being baked in ovens, flower gardens are blooming in the blazing heat. Bread art has caught the fancy of dough nuts the world over and they are rising to the challenge. The lockdown has turned the humble flat, yeasted Italian focaccia into a canvas for home bakers to showcase their creativity and artistic flair. There’s a virtual collection of bread masterpieces on the internet, with #focacciaart trending among bakers.

Ever since vegan foodpreneur Marieen Vijay came across her first floral focaccia online, she knew it had to become part of the baked offerings of her company, Catalyst Foods. All through the lockdown Marieen has been making larger ‘focaccia tapestry’ loaves and mini ‘cameo’ loaves, decorated with bell peppers, olives, and the nutritious ‘manathakali’ leaves from her terrace garden.

""They’re wholesome and healthy,"" says Marieen. ""For me, just baking them is therapeutic. It’s such a positive feeling during this lockdown.""

Priya Ravi had never tried her hand at making breads. ""But suddenly I was seeing bread art everywhere online. That got me to try baking a focaccia for the first time. It demystified all my fears of making bread as focaccia is easy, no fuss and done with minimal hands-on time,"" says Priya, a home baker from Chennai now based in Kuala Lumpur. She recreated Van Gogh’s ‘Poppy Flowers’ on dough, using cherry tomatoes for the flowers and mozzarella for the vase.

Other ingredients that can be used to decorate the bread are basil for leaves, olives as rocks or centres of flowers, rosemary for small plants, sausages for flower centres or seed pods, and cheese for sand.

In Adyar, Rajashree Raghavamurthy, locked in with two constantly hungry teenage boys who wanted ‘something different’ everyday, tried a focaccia lunch. ""I come from a family of hoteliers, so I guess once a foodie always one. With all of us in lockdown I could no longer get away with the no-time-to-experiment-with-baking excuse,"" she says. ""Google, Instagram, YouTube, Pinterest, there’s a whole buffet of bread art designs out there to choose from. I started baking with a tip from here and there. It was fun. And it’s healthy and tastes great.""

While no one is quite sure who sparked the botanical focaccia trend, it’s clearly grown into a staple in a lockdown baker’s life.

MANGALURU: Ramzan fasting did not deter members of Viqaya , the emergency response and social service wing of the Samastha Kerala Sunni Students Federation (SKSSF), from donating blood in emergency situation during lockdown.

Viqaya members Khalid Ajjavara and Arif Madavu did not think twice when they received the message for emergency blood requirement from a hospital in Sullia a week ago. Another member Azharuddin Bellare rushed immediately and donated blood during fasting at Puttur recently. Viqaya members have donated nearly 60 units of blood since day one of the Covid-19 lockdown and they continued the service even after the commencement of fasting month.

Thajudin Tarly, vice chairman of Viqaya Dakshina Kannada district unit, told TOI that that the WhatsApp groups of the organisation always remains alert and members respond to problems immediately. “After the commencement of Ramzan fasting, five members of Viqaya have already donated blood and two have gone to donate in Mangaluru today (May 7). Our members on fasting have been donating blood after consulting doctors and taking their advice. Meanwhile, we also have discussed the matter with religious leaders, who endorsed our mission with a go ahead since it is a noble cause,” Tarly said.

He added that Viqaya members respond to messages in case of blood requirements or for any other help 24x7. “We have 12 zones of Viqaya in Dakshina Kannada and there are more than 100 units functioning under it with nearly 15,000 members. Members have been responding to people, especially those poor patients. Last year, when the government hospital in Sullia was facing shortage of Group D staff, Viqaya members offered voluntary service on regular basis till the government appointed permanent staff. Members were actively involved in the rescue operations at many places during flood. In addition, members also volunteer social work including burial of unclaimed dead bodies,” he said.

411,['17/05/2020'],Telangana: Teachers seek police help for their salaries,"Representative Image

HYDERABAD: After failing to get help from the education department, teachers of a private school in Rangareddy district have now approached the police, claiming that their management did not pay them salaries since March.

They alleged that the management is terminating the teachers who are demanding salaries. The teachers said that despite collecting 99% of the fee from students, the management had withheld the salaries.

“We have shared our plight with the mandal education officer (MEO) and district education officer (DEO). But, the issue is yet to be resolved,” said a social science teacher who teaches at a private school.

He said the school has three branches in the city and teachers working in these schools were not paid since March. The management is blaming lockdown for the crisis. “I am also the vice-principal of the school. I know that more than 99% students have cleared their fee. So, why is the management not paying us even after collecting fees from the students,” the teacher questioned.

The teachers of the school, who approached education officials in April, had also moved the Telangana State Human Rights Commission (TSHRC) before contacting the police. On May 6, the commission has directed the DEO to enquire into the issue and file an action taken report.

When contacted, the MEO told TOI that he has directed the school management to clear dues in the next couple of days. “They informed us that they have already cleared 70% of dues for March and would be paying remaining dues in the next couple of days,” he added.

The management, meanwhile, said that they are not in a position to pay April and May salaries to those teachers who are hired on a 10-month contract but the dues of regular teachers would be cleared. Chandrayanagutta police confirmed receiving the complaint.

The visit came on a day TOI front-paged a report highlighting the inadequate manpower at the checkpost .

Rai visited both Patradevi and the Maharashtra check post next to it, to see if the data matches. He spent around 25 minutes at the state border and inferred that some permanent infrastructure can be erected at the Patradevi checkpost. On Sunday, a team of senior government officials will visit the spot to see what best can be done before the arrival of the monsoon.

Currently, police, home guards and other staff sit under temporary pandals. The checkpost sees over 300 goods carriers cross into Goa daily. Information on persons crossing are shared by both the Goa and Maharashtra sides.

A top government official also said that there is no standard operating procedure to man the check posts. He said that the government is still observing and correcting things as they are brought to its notice.

MEERUT: He must have been too clever or too foolish. Yes, an ""aimlessly moving"" youth with his friend on a bike in Meerut - one covering his face with a handkerchief and the other without any mask - soon realised that they had bumped into some policemen.

One of them promptly took out a 10-rupee note and pasted it across his mouth as an innovative face mask. The cops after seeing his noteworthy performance let them off but only after ""gifting"" them two face masks and an FIR.

Circle officer of Civil Lines, Sanjeev Deshwal, told TOI, ""I was on lockdown duty when a bike crossed the road with two youths. The front one was wearing a handkerchief. When the constable spotted the pillion rider, he quickly pasted a 10-rupee note across his mouth. They claimed that they did not have any mask and so, we handed over two to them. But, the two could not explain why they were roaming around during lockdown.""

The incident occurred near L Block Shastri Nagar in Meerut on Saturday. An FIR has been registered against the two youths under IPC section 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant) and relevant sections of Epidemic Diseases Act. Police sources said the two - Amir and Mehboob - worked as contractual workers in the city itself.

When asked about his performance, Amir said, ""A mask costs Rs 40 and I had only Rs 10. So, I used it as a mask. We live in Parikshitgarh area of the district and had come to the city to collect payment from our employer.""

In fact, Amir added that he was now much content wearing a proper face mask ""gifted by the cops"", rather than his 10-rupee note.

416,['17/05/2020'],A song for the times,"CHENNAI: For many, one of the most enduring takeaways from the Covid-19 outbreak has been realising what a powerful equalizer it is, one that has brought to a standstill lives of all people irrespective of who they were and what they did in the pre-Covid world. For Sashank Manohar, bassist of city-based alternative band The F16s, it melted the boundaries that separated him as an artist from a loving fan following that looked forward to every new release or gig announcement on their Instagram page.

But now, grappling with their own fears over cancelled gigs, postponed festivals and stalled recordings, Sashank and his band mates decided to do the most cathartic thing — create work that showed, ""we are more human than we are artists"". This sense of shared resilience, struggle and hope is at the heart of a new wave of homemade videos that musicians are releasing online during lockdown.

The F16s took one of their old songs, and released it as a music video on Instagram that compiled clips from their old road trips with those of their present life at home — cooking, playing with pets, jamming with whatever they have.

""We realised that this work had the sort of character that an aesthetically pleasing video that could be shot any time of the year wouldn’t have. It shows some happy memories, some difficult times, and a personal side to us as individuals and not just a band, because we too are coping with the uncertainty,"" says Sashank.

For some others, these home videos are not just poetic expressions of life in the times of Covid, but a golden opportunity for collaboration that has become the norm for many creators locked at home.

City musician Shilpa Natarajan found abundant fodder in these ""eerie, dystopian"" times to write her song, ‘Lockdown’, which she released as a home-shot music video last month.

""I had my husband shoot the video inside our home and on the terrace. For another song, ‘Haunted’, we used my cat’s food box with parchment paper as a light diffuser and my lyrics stand as a tripod. We connected with friends over Skype who helped us remotely and edited the video. This is the most productive I have been,"" says Shilpa, who is set to release ‘Haunted’, by mid-June.

The idea of music as a means to reflect the mood of these strange times has encouraged creators to push several technical and creative boundaries too. City filmmaker Richard Anthony, who is editing a music video for the band, Aagroh, says they’ve refrained from the conventional format of storytelling to convey people’s state of mind as it is.

""We asked women from different parts of the country to shoot and send videos of themselves at home — reading, walking, smoking or just,"" he says. Swati Vishnoi, who’s directing the video, says the fact that the models are regular people creates a world of difference. ""There’s no equipment, no lights and no reference images. It’s just them and their stories. That’s also the best and the most challenging part.""

417,['17/05/2020'],"More helping hands as men pitch in with washing, scrubbing &amp; cooking","Pune: Trader Murtuza Poonawalla jokes that Vim bar is his new best friend since the lockdown. He has been spending most of his time with the dish washing soap, after his family.

According to Poonawalla, his day, which would start with consuming breakfast and going to his shop, now follows a completely different routine.

“After breakfast, I wash the first lot of utensils. A little while later, I help my wife with cooking or try my hand at some recipes myself. I put the washed clothes out to dry and then head for lunch. After lunch, I play with my children for a while and then head to wash the second round of utensils. The day goes by with small or big chores and I find myself washing the third round of utensils after dinner. I did none of these before the lockdown. I never knew what all it takes to keep food ready on the table whenever I came back home from work,” he said.

Like him, several boys and men from the city, who grew up without contributing actively to household chores, are now experts at maintaining and even running the house. From dusting and sweeping to chopping and cooking, boys and men have now done it all due to the lockdown.

Yuvraj Chaudhary too has made household chores part of his routine. “Sweeping, mopping, washing utensils and cleaning the bathrooms, I’ve learnt it all. I had never done any of this before and the first few days were a struggle. However, I got used to all the tasks over time,” he said.

Employed in the hospitality industry, Sahib Sehmbey, who lives alone in Pune, said, “This has changed since the lockdown began. I bought a new pan and learnt how to make food that wasn’t eggs. I learnt how to buy vegetables and stocked up my refrigerator for the first time ever. I have been trying different recipes, including frying samosas and nuggets. I’ve managed to cut my fingers while chopping and scrubbing. I now know how to clean the toilet, let alone the rest of the house.”

Businessmen Sanjay Parmar and his son Prasanna hardly had any role in household chores before the lockdown. “We had domestic help who would do all the washing and cleaning while my mother did the cooking. Once the lockdown began, the domestic help stopped coming. We divided responsibilities. I wash all the utensils while my father dries them and sets them back in place. I cut fruits while my father has been making various juices for us,” Prasanna said.

CEO Abhijit Chitnis said, “Now, having to share responsibilities, one realizes the efforts that go into running a household. I have been helping with daily activities like sweeping, mopping, dusting and cleaning.”

Hyderabad: Senior Congress leader V Hanumantha Rao ’s plans to send migrant workers in buses to Odisha turned ugly when Telangana Rashtra Samithi and Congress workers clashed at Sircilla on Friday night. The district administration finally arranged buses for the migrant workers who left at 2.30 am on Saturday.

In Hyderabad, VHR said he had gone to Sircilla to send the workers to Odisha in buses he had arranged, but police did not allow him and instead slapped a case against him.

On the other hand, TRS workers said they had been taking care of the needs of the workers and that VHR had no right to come to Sircilla and interfere in their relief work.

When they questioned where was the necessity for him to come all the way to Sircilla, VHR explained that he had already arranged three buses to send the workers to their native places and that he had taken the necessary permission from the authorities concerned.

Around 10 pm on Friday, police took away VHR to the police station and detained him there.

The workers told the media that they had been trying to go back to their native places in the last three days.

They had come to work in brick kilns in Sircilla eight months ago and the lockdown had made it difficult for them to stay back. They said 85 of them had been working at Pothugal in Sircilla and were out of work.

The situation further worsened when the cops and the district administration told VHR that only a limited number of people could be sent in three buses that had been arranged for them by the Congress leader.

Either the company or the individual seafarers will have to pay.”TOI was the first to report that charters flights with stranded seafarers from Europe would land in Goa. “The government is also concentrating on bringing back NRIs stranded abroad,” said NRI commissioner Narendra Sawaikar. “There are many stranded in the Gulf and the UK.”The government is also in talks with companies to bring back seafarers stranded in the US and Canada. “Negotiations are on,” Reddy said. “Things will be clearer next week. Besides Europe and Canada, there are also seafarers stranded in the Gulf.”He added that efforts are on to have seafarers arriving by sea to disembark crew at MPT, Goa, and not Mumbai. “We are asking companies to disembark the Goan crew in Goa itself,” he said. “We don’t want them to disembark (elsewhere) and travel through a red zone.”President of the Goan Seamen Association of India, Frank Viegas, has appealed to the Goa government to prepare testing facilities as well as transportation and quarantine services to ensure everything goes on smoothly. “The seafarers and their families, who are eagerly waiting to meet them, are all very stressed. They shouldn’t face any hurdles on their arrival in Goa,” said its ex-president, Dixon Vaz.",goa,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-47529300,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-110164,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/charters-to-bring-414-seafarers-from-italy-to-goa-this-week/articleshow/75783132.cms

VIJAYAWADA: A man identified as Veerendra hacked his wife to death suspecting her fidelity, in Repalle, Guntur district , on Saturday. Veerendra then went to the police station, confessed to his crime and swallowed poison , which he had brought with him.

The police quickly sent him and a couple of police personnel to the Tenali hospital and went to the crime scene with his team.

On reaching the crime spot, inspector S Sambasivarao said that he saw Upputuri Soujanya (30) lying in a pool of blood. She was attacked late in the night with a sickle while she was asleep and perhaps could not defend herself, he said. Her two children, Bhavya Sri (6) and Jyosnika (4) were found asleep next to her, unharmed. The body was sent for post-mortem.

Bapatla DSP, A Srinivasa Rao, visited the crime scene and took stock of the investigation. He said Veerendra, who is a teacher, suspected that his wife was having an extra-marital affair and killed her.

A case under section 302 of IPC has been booked against him and his condition is said to be stable now.

Even their parents are not willing to send their children to other cities.“Even if we are able to travel freely again, there will always be a fear that we might not be able to be with our daughter in case of emergency. This crisis has shown us that students can get stranded with no help across the world. It is not worth taking the risk. There are quality colleges locally,” said Nirmala V, a parent.On the other hand, students say that they too understand their parents’ fear.“It has always been tough for students to convince parents about the need to go to another district, state or abroad. But, such experience is very helpful for the growth of many students, especially those who are passionate and ambitious about their studies. At the start of the year, we were asking students to look for such opportunities. But, now, we are not sure of advising students to go against their parents,” said R Ramya, a school counsellor and Class XII English teacher.Another reason that students and parents are not preferring to look for college admissions outside their district is because of the cost involved. Teachers say that with many parents struggling financially amid lockdown, they would hesitate to invest more money for their children’s higher studies.Meanwhile, faculty in Madurai colleges say that may be a demand for seats in all top colleges.“We have actually started getting a lot of inquiries after we set up a portal for online registration. Students could register and update their marks later. Many non-regular courses like microbiology, food science and visual communication are getting a lot of attention.

With no Shah Rukh Khan to help him, it was left to state authorities to ensure that Rana did not miss the train.

Rana, who had a permit to travel to HP, reached just two minutes late, running onto the platform just as the train was being flagged off by North Goa collector R Menaka and North Goa SP Utkrisht Prasoon. Even as Rana spilled his near-miss story, the authorities decided to pull out all stops to ensure that the man and his two bags made it onto the train. Menaka ordered Konkan Railway officials to make a ticket for the Kangra district resident while police used its vehicle to rush the man to the next stop— Tivim railway station where he was put onto the train home.

“I heard about the train just some time ago and I came here as fast as I could,” said Rana.

Menaka said that the train’s passenger manifest would be updated with Rana’s details and sent to the HP government. “It so happened that one person reached quite late so we have arranged for him to depart from the Tivim railway station in consultation with the railway authority,” said Menaka.

The train with 582 passengers will arrive at Una after a two-day journey. This is the second train to Himachal Pradesh. Rana was not the only one to be accommodated at the last minute. Authorities held up the train beyond its scheduled departure time just so that Upendra Uraon, a bartender at a Sinquerim nightclub, could make it.

“I found out about the train just one hour before the departure time, around 5pm,” said Uraon, who grabbed his bag and documents and rushed to the station even as police kept tabs on his movement from Sinquerim. “I got so many calls fromofficials while on my way that I was confident that the train would not leave without me,” he said.

With the state doing all it can to ensure that the passengers reach home, the station resounded with words of gratitude as the train left. While some yelled, ‘Goa Police is the best’ others shouted ‘Thank you Goa’. “The intention was to assist all those who wanted to leave. Though the scheduled time of departure was 6pm we got calls from the Himachal Pradesh government saying that they have issued permits to some people at the last minute, and they asked us to facilitate their travel. So we held the train for some time,” said Menaka.

426,['17/05/2020'],Goa: Iron ore transportation leads to air pollution in mining belt,"Photo used for representational purpose only

PANAJI: Iron ore transportation has once again led to increase in air pollution in the state’s mining belt. Air monitoring data with the Goa State Pollution Control Board (GSPCB) shows that pollution in the areas is due to ore transportation activities, which commenced in March.

GSPCB member secretary Shamila Monteiro told TOI that the board has written to the directorate of mines and geology to reduce the number of ore transportation trips by trucks in areas where it has noticed air pollution. “As per the direction, DMG will reduce the mining truck trips,” she said.

GSPCB monitors air quality at 12 locations across the state through air ambient quality monitoring stations.

As per the report from the monitoring stations installed at Capxem, Sanvordem, Sanguem, Ambegal-Pale and Curchorem it has exceeded PM 10 limit.

A senior board officer told TOI that the PM 10 level exceeded the permissible limit due to vehicular transportation of ore.

Last week TOI had counted over 300 trips made by the mining trucks, over 10 times more than the number stipulated by DMG in the South Goa mining belt. And going by the sheer number of trucks making multiple trips to the jetties, a back of the envelope estimate suggests that in the past one week itself, an average of 35,000 tonne iron ore was sent for exports every day — a quantity equivalent to 18 to 20 barges.

In March 15, 2018, mining in Goa came to a halt following a Supreme Court order quashing the second renewal of 88 mining leases. In January 2020, the apex court permitted export of ore extracted before March 15, 2018.

In March 2020, mining companies resumed transportation of royalty-paid iron ore in the state. Around six mining companies got permission from both the DMG and GSPCB to transport ore.

There is 1.45 million tonne of royalty-paid ore which the respective companies have started transporting; there is also another 7.7 million tonne on which royalty has not been paid, an official said.

The state government is set to e-auction around 2.5 million tonne iron ore this month as per DMG.

MADURAI: Hospitals across the state, both government and private, are seeing an increase in footfall of non-emergency patients for the past few days with relaxations being announced during lockdown. Doctors said that those who can use their own vehicle or hire a mode of transport for themselves are starting to queue up at the outpatient department of hospitals, which are functioning with Covid-19 precautionary measures in place.

“Though footfall of patients is not yet back to normal, it is increasing when compared to the start of April. Those who were coming for regular check-ups are returning now, especially as it has been nearly two months since lockdown,” said Dr B Kannan, medical administrator at a private multi-specialty hospital, which generally witnesses a footfall of 1,500 outpatients in a day. He observed that while only those who needed treatments like chemotherapy and dialysis used to frequent for the past months, now others including ante-natal mothers are visiting hospital.

At Government Rajaji Hospital (GRH) in Madurai , which is one of the biggest tertiary care centres in the state, footfall to outpatient departments is slowly increasing, according to doctors. Even elderly and pregnant women, who can arrange their private vehicles, have started to come for check-ups. “Many patients are coming from nearby villages to the city,” said a senior doctor at GRH.

While government hospitals are yet to continue elective surgeries, many private hospitals have already started resuming it. “We are taking all precautions and they do need to be done soon as patients have already waited for a long time. Otherwise, it would end up being an emergency case, particularly for cancer or cardiac patients,” said an oncological surgeon, who did not wish to be named. Meanwhile, some smaller private clinics and hospitals remained shut or continued to function with restricted timings amid Covid-19 scare. “Even with restricted timings, the footfall has increased. However, we are not getting new patients for outpatient departments,” said Dr A Sowmiya, duty medical officer at a private hospital.

GSL will build the vessels for approximately Rs 600 crore once the final contract is inked, chairman and managing director of GSL, Bharat Bhushan Nagpal said.

GSL is already executing a follow-on order for five offshore patrol vessels for the Coast Guard, the first of which was commissioned on Friday.

“GSL has emerged as lowest bidder to build two pollution control vessels. This is a Rs 600 crore project for the Indian Coast Guard,” Nagpal said.

Contract negotiations for the two pollution control vessels will begin with the defence ministry and the Indian Coast Guard, and once the terms are decided, the contract will be inked.

“In another two or three months we hope that the contract will be signed. The build period is 46 months for delivery,” Nagpal said.

The ongoing novel coronavirus pandemic has affected the entire supply chain logistics and has also forced GSL to put in place additional precautionary measures. “We have isolated each section at the shipyard. We are now operating in two shifts and each shift does not interact. We are also sanitising everything in between shifts,” Nagpal said.

Speaking about the stealth frigates that GSL is building for the Indian Navy, Nagpal said that though slightly delayed, the pace will pick up in the coming weeks. “We will be receiving drawings from Russia by end of May. We have already ordered the plates and should commence production by July or at the latest by early August,” Nagpal said.

The keel for the first of the two guided missile frigates for the Indian Navy, known as Project 1135.6, were to be laid in early 2020. The stealth warships, valued at over Rs 14,250 crore, will be built at GSL based on technology transfer from Russia’s Yantar Shipyard and Severnoye Design Bureau.

The workers had gone to Gujarat to work as construction labourers. All of them belong to Thorrur village in Mahbubabad district.

“We do not have food to eat and have been starving. We need help to return home,” the migrant workers said in videos they made seeking help.

Breaking down into tears in a video, a worker said: “We are desperate to return.” Balaji, another worker, said nobody had given them any provisions. “We are even willing to walk back to our village but because of our age, it is difficult,” he said. Balaji said though they were financially weak, if they have to pay money for their travel they would make arrangements but wanted the state government to at least help them get permissions and make travel arrangements. - Sushil Rao

However, Verna police brought the situation under control. The migrants told police that they had no money to pay their house rent and that their room owners had asked them to vacate their premises. When questioned, the house owners told police that they had not asked for money nor had they asked them to vacate the rooms.

Members of the Sancoale village panchayat assured the migrants that till they get back to their states, the panchayat would take care of their grocery needs. The migrants were also told that their names had been registered and that the government will plan their journey back to their native states.

437,['17/05/2020'],Re 1 property registration for women scrapped,"Ranchi: In a bid to revive the state coffers, the Jharkhand government scrapped the exclusive scheme for women which allowed registration of properties worth up to Rs 50 lakh at a token Re 1 in the wake of revenue losses during the lockdown.

The state revenue, registration and land reforms department on Friday issued a notification to this tune and also laid out the standard operation procedures for all registry offices. This includes, not more than 40 registries per day, pre-booked appointment and other dos and don’ts for visitors and staff at the offices, thereby indicating the services by next week.

Earlier this week on Tuesday, the state government had also rolled back the VAT rebate on diesel and petrol prices making vehicular fuel dearer by Rs 2.50. Interestingly, both the schemes were implemented during the previous BJP government headed by Raghubar Das.

Chief minister Hemant Soren on Saturday said, “The state is in a difficult financial situation now and all its resources are going into combating Covid-19 and feeding the hungry. There is a long fight ahead. Hence, the government is trying its best to explore avenues to revive its revenues to sustain the crisis.”

He also accused the Raghubar Das regime for pushing the state into a financial crisis. He reiterated, “The past government’s poor planning and excessive expenditure has dented the financial health of the state so much that when we took over, we inherited a frail treasury.”

State finance minister Rameshwar Oraon on the other hand said that during tough times, some tough measures ought to be taken. “The government is taking some tough steps to generate revenues while on the other hand it is constantly demanding the Centre for a special package to this state. So far nothing has been assured,” Oraon said.

He added, “While the Centre raised some hopes by announcing a Rs 20 lakh crore economic package a few days back, as the details are filtering about the allocation, it seems to be nothing, but an eyewash. Poor, jobless, migrants, farmers don’t seem to be benefited.”

Meanwhile, the state BJP unit accused the Mahagathbandhan government of being anti-farmers and anti-women. BJP’s state president of women cell, Arti Singh said, “Registration of property for women Re 1 was a milestone during our regime as it empowered lakhs of women in this state. By scrapping the scheme, the Hemant Soren government has exposed its anti-women stand, like they proved their anti-farmer stand by stopping the CM Krishi Ashiward Yojana meant for farmers.”

They will also be fed, accommodated until arrangements are made and dropped home on the state’s expenses, said chief minister Hemant Soren on Saturday.

The move, arguably the first-of-its-kind in the country, came after 24 migrants died in Uttar Pradesh’s Auraiya district in a road accident on Saturday morning. Seven of the deceased belonged to Bokaro district’s Pindrajora area.

Hemant said, “It’s a very tragic incident and shouldn’t have happened to any migrant anywhere in this time of crisis. Over the last few days I have been reading reports of similar accidents elsewhere, including a few in Jharkhand. Hence, I have issued a standing order to stop migrant movement in the state and nobody should be forced to travel on foot.”

Talking further on the sidelines of an event at his residence on Saturday, he added, “I have asked all the districts to arrange for their transport besides feeding them properly. This will be irrespective of the fact whether any migrant belongs to Jharkhand or some other state.”

“It is our responsibility to take care of all who come to Jharkhand. If any migrant steps into the boundaries of our state on foot, officials have been asked to stop them till proper arrangements are made for their travel back home. Nodal officers should strike a coordination with their counterparts in other states to workout a safe movement plan on a priority basis,” he added.

Hemant also appealed to others states to curb movement of migrants on foot. “All states should work to stop migrant movements on foot, take their details and coordinating with respective states.”

Soon after the directives, Jharkhand DGP MV Rao issued orders to all the SPs asking them to coordinate with respective deputy commissioners to enforce the diktat in toto on a priority basis.

Jharkhand Janadhikar Mahasabha, a conglomeration of rights groups, welcomed the move and asked Hemant to write to the Centre and other states to start free buses, community kitchens and temporary sheds on state and national highways. In a statement, the outfit said, “CM must write to Centre and all states to arrange free buses for migrants. There should be arrangement of sheds, kitchens on highways so that migrants can be fed properly and take rest till arrangements are made.”

The updated calendar has curtailed holidays and cultural activities to compensate for the loss in the number of classes owing to the ongoing lockdown.

Manoj Kumar, who is in-charge of the internal quality assurance cell at CUJ, said, “We have decided to cut down on some cultural activities and have increased the working hours by an hour. Even the lunch hour will now be for just 45 minutes, instead of an hour. We are currently running late by one and a half months but we hope to make up for the losses by July next year.”

Although the University Grants Commission (UGC) suggested to run classes 180 days in a year, CUJ will continue with 176 working days.

Kumar said that although UGC asked the universities to opt for alternate ways of conducting exams, CUJ may continue with the current method.

Dr Shyama Prasad Mukherjee University in Ranchi will provide its students with study material next month for their examination scheduled in July and it will release the new academic calendar by next week. Kolhan University is, however, waiting for instructions from the state government. Vice-chancellor Shukla Mohanty said, “We are working on a new academic calendar in sync with UGC’s guidelines but before we can finalise it, we are waiting for the state government’s instructions.” Mohanty added that they are planning to reduce the number of holidays to make up for lost time but they will not extend the working hours.

Vinoba Bhave University in Hazaribag will curtail winter vacation and Dussehra holidays in its new academic calendar. Vice-chancellor Ramesh Sharan said, “We have prepared the new calendar and we are ready to begin classes for the new students from September.” VBU is also planning to conduct online examination for its MBA students.

440,['17/05/2020'],"Mine associations, trade unions oppose privatization of coal sector","Sindri: The BCCL chapter of the coal mines officer’s association and trade unions on Saturday opposed the Union government’s decision to open up coal mines to the private sector and allow commercial mining. The move came after Union finance minister Nirmala Sitaram announced a Rs 50,000-crore boost to the coal infra and FDI in defence sector as part of the fourth instalment of the Atma Nirbhar Bharat scheme.

“Coal Mines Officer’s Association of India (CMOAI) would oppose any move to privatise the coal sector and allow commercial mining of coal,” said general secretary of BCCL chapter of CMOAI, Bhabani Bandopadhyay adding Sitaraman’s announcement is nothing but an attempt to betray the confidence posed by pubic in the present government.

“All previous attempts in this regard have failed. More than 100 coal blocks have already been allotted to private players, but they have not succeeded in achieving the goal so far. Mining is a complex field and it is a tough nut for private companies to crack who just aim for profits without taking care of other factors,” Bandopadhyay opined.

Dhanbad Coal Karamchari Sangh general secretary K P Gupta said any attempt to privatise the coal sector would be opposed. “The Union government has been trying to introduce commercial mining since 2015, but has not succeeded because of opposition by all trade unions. Centre is trying to serve the cause of some capitalists.”

National general secretary of CITU-affiliated All India Coal Workers Federation, D D Ramnandan, said Sitharaman’s announcement is nothing but an attempt to deceive public in the name of relief packages in times of Covid-19. “The central government has allowed private players to mine coal by passing a law under the Coal Mines Special Provisions Act 2015, but no major players have come forward so far as coal mining involves problems of land acquisition and local disturbances and are not profitable propositions for private investors who look for quick money,” Ramnandan said.

“Sitharaman announced a package of Rs 50, 000 crore for developing evacuation infrastructure for enhancing coal production, but has no answer as to why the three rail lines of the coal corridor from Chandwa to Tori in Jharkhand, from Jharsuguda to Barapalli in Odisha and from Raigarh to Mand in Chhatisgarh are not completed in the last 15 years. Coal production would go up by 100MT if these rail lines become operational,” Ramnandan opined adding the announcement has been made without making any ground survey.

“The government should give direct relief to the needy and not help corporate houses in the name of relief packages to the poor,” he added.

Many jawans of the paramilitary force are on leave and stranded in various parts of Bihar and Jharkhand ever since the nationwide lockdown was imposed on March 25.

CRPF (Jharkhand-Bihar zone) IG Rajkumar on Saturday said soon after the lockdown came into force, the jawans were ordered to stay put wherever they are as a precautionary measure to prevent the spread of the novel coronavirus. He added, “As the lockdown is continuing, we have decided to recall the personnel stranded in green zones in Bihar and Jharkhand after May 17. A significant number of them are in green zones in the two states.”

CRPF has created a quarantine unit at each of its battalion centre for the returning jawans. The quarantine centre at Ranchi has 75 beds and will cater to those reporting to the force’s state headquarters and the battalion here. Rajkumar said the returning jawans will be put under 14-day quarantine at their respective battalion and their health will be closely monitored.

“The quarantine units have a separate mess and toilets. The norms of segregation and social distancing will be observed here. The body temperature of jawans will be monitored and they will join anti-extremist operations after getting a certificate from the district health authority,” he said.

Meanwhile, CRPF will also replace its two companies posted at the containment zone of Hindpiri in Ranchi and one company has arrived in the city to take charge. The jawans withdrawn from Hindpiri will also be put under quarantine for 14 days. CRPF was deployed in the locality on April 28 to enforce the lockdown after many instances of violations were reported from the area.

RANCHI: The north and southeastern parts of Jharkhand will receive light to moderate rainfall on Wednesday next week due to an approaching cyclone on the eastern coast of the country, IMD Ranchi said on Saturday.

Talking to TOI, director IMD Ranchi, S D Kotal said, “Although we are keeping a tap on the movement of the cyclone, according to the present conditions, moderate rainfall and thunderstorm is expected in the northeast and southeast parts of the state.”

He said, “It may rapidly develop into a cyclonic storm in the next 12 hours and further into a severe cyclonic storm in the subsequent 24 hours. It is also likely to move northwestwards initially till Sunday and then re-curve north-eastwards across Bay of Bengal and hit West Bengal coast any time between Monday and Wednesday.”

Kotal said that the cyclone is intensifying gradually and the rain will be accompanied by wind blowing at 40-50 kmph, mainly during the late hours of Thursday. Because of its nominal effect over Jharkhand, the state disaster management team has been given a normal rainfall alert only.

However, the department in its daily bulletin has predicted light rainfall, thunderstorm and lightening throughout the next week until Friday. “Apart from the cyclonic disturbance over limited parts of the state, light and moderate rainfall is expected over most part of the state due to frequent thunderstorms and temperature will be stable for the next three-four days.”

443,['17/05/2020'],Canada relaxes work rules for international students,"International students enrolled in Canadian educational institutions will be able to commence their courses online from their home countries and still be eligible for the postgraduate work programme (PGWP), which is available for up to three years. The tenure of the work permit typically depends on the length of the educational course in Canada .

In the wake of coronavirus-related travel interruptions around the world, Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) — the government’s immigration arm — has made its rules more flexible. Under normal circumstances, the IRCC pointed out, the stringent PGWP norms limit an international student’s ability to pursue a programme via distance learning. The time spent studying outside Canada is deducted from the length of the work permit for which they would otherwise be eligible, it added.

Explaining the relaxations given, IRCC said: “PGWP eligibility will not be affected for international students whose fall courses will be conducted online owing to Covid-19... International students may begin their classes while outside Canada and complete up to 50% of the programme via distance learning if they cannot travel to Canada sooner. If studies were completed outside of Canada up to December 31, 2020, this time will not be deducted from their future work permit tenure.”

This spells good news as Canadian education and work experience help students garner higher points under the Express-Entry route, if he or she wishes to become a permanent resident. Canadian permanent residency is akin to a green card in the US. According to the IRCC, nearly 54,000 former students had opted to become permanent residents in 2018. With 1.39 lakh study permits (34.5% of the total), Indians were the highest constituent of international students in 2019.

448,['17/05/2020'],"Now, NMC fails to achieve even revised revenue target","Nagpur: The Nagpur Municipal Corporation has failed to achieve the revised revenue target for 2019-20 and earned Rs2,257 crore which is Rs440.91 crore less than the revised target of Rs2698.35 crore.

In March this year, municipal commissioner Tukaram Mundhe had revised former standing committee chairman Pradip Pohane’s Rs3197.60 crore budget to Rs2698.35 crore. Though the budget was slashed by 499.25 crore, the civic body managed to generate approximately Rs2257.44 crore.

Though the former standing committee chairman had expected 62.64% of total revenue from the state government in his budget, the civic body’s dependency on the government grants has increased this year too if one scrutinizes the civic body’s financial data. According to figures procured from the NMC, over 73% of the income in 2019-20 received from the state government, while their income from local taxes like property tax, water tax, town planning department and market dues etc contributed about 27% of the last fiscal revenue.

The NMC had generated Rs624.80 crore from its own sources including property tax, water works and town planning department. The civic body, however, received Rs1632.63 crore as Goods and Services Tax grants and other grants from the government.

The LBT had projected Rs9 crore income but earned only Rs3.84 crore. The Pohane’s budget had projected a major chunk of the NMC revenue from property tax and set a target of Rs443.70 crore, but the NMC could mop up only Rs244.33 crore.

Only two departments, water works and town planning, contributed excess revenue than the set targets. The water works department contributed Rs178.17 crore against a target of Rs160 crore, while the town planning department generated Rs108.33 crore against Rs94.91 crore target.

Sources said former municipal commissioner Abhijit Bangar had dropped various works pertaining to basic amenities worth over Rs772 crore approved in the last fiscal due to poor revenue collection and finding new income sources.

Even Mundhe had stopped many sanctioned and state government-funded development works due to scanty of funds.

The civic body attributed the poor collection to various factors including Lok Sabha and Maharashtra assembly elections. According to the NMC officials, poll duties among other reasons which had a major impact on the revenue.

Opposition parties in the NMC blamed the poor tax recovery due to exaggerated revenue target set by standing committee chairman. In last one decade, the NMC had never achieved the target set by any of the standing committee chairmen, alleged leader of opposition and senior Congress corporator Tanaji Wanve.

Ruling party leader Sandip Jadhav said the situation in other civic bodies across the country is similar. Any civic body including the NMC has limited source of revenue, he said, adding: “Though low revenue collection affected the development work planned for the city, the timely release of grants from the previous BJP-ruled state government had helped the civic body to continue the works in the city.”

Civic activists said that the NMC should spend on development on the basis of tax recovery from a ward. “If a particular ward generates good tax, it would get priority in executing development work,” said activists.

NAGPUR: In view of the nationwide lockdown, the Nagpur bench of Bombay high court has extended the parole of underworld don Arun Gawli for second time.

“Keeping in mind the lockdown extension by the government due to Covid-19 pandemic till May 17, and the fact that till date the petitioner has not violated any of the conditions imposed upon him and also considering the congestion in jails, as reflected in the additional affidavit filed by the petitioner, in my view, here is no hurdle in granting extension of parole leave,” justice Swapna Joshi said before allowing the gangster’s application.

Gawli was granted parole for attending his ailing wife Asha on February 26, but after lockdown was implemented, he moved an application through his counsel Mir Nagman Ali in HC on April 23 to extend it due to travel restrictions. That time his leave was extended till May 10 by the high court.

As the government extended lockdown till May 17, the Mumbai’s Dagdi Chawl resident again move an application for extension of parole through Ali citing the same reason of travelling restrictions. Assistant government pleader Amir Madiwale strongly opposed it contending that Gawli could be lodged at nearest Taloja Central Jail in Navi Mumbai, instead of extending the parole.

Ali pointed out that the petitioner hasn’t violated any of the conditions while on parole and he has surrendered on scheduled dates whenever he was released on parole and furlough. He submitted that Gawli was unable to travel to the city due to travelling restrictions.

While extending his parole by a week after May 17, justice Joshi then directed the don to surrender before the deadline.

Gawli, who was convicted for the murder of MLA Kamalakar Jamsandekar along with 11 others on August 3, 2012, was awarded rigorous life imprisonment in 2012 and is undergoing the sentence in Nagpur Central jail since then.

Nagpur which reported its 5th Covid-19 death on Saturday has the highest at 341 followed by Akola where two women tested positive for Covid-19 on Saturday taking total number to 220.

Thirty eight more patients were released in Yavatmal on Saturday under revised guidelines. Within a day, Yavatmal’s number of confirmed positive Covid-19 cases came down from 45 to seven which technically upgraded the district into Orange Zone from Red. Amravati released six patients and five were discharged in Nagpur taking total number of recovered patients to 49 on Saturday. Recovery rate of Vidarbha continued to surge for the fourth day and crossed 60% mark. Many more patients are likely to be discharged in next three days.

Shock and panic gripped the city, which went into a 40-hour Janata Curfew from 3 pm on Saturday as the news went viral on social media. With new areas reporting cases, people are fearing community outbreak but are still giving a go-by to maintaining distancing in public places.

Police were in a shock when a 48-year-old DB squad in-charge of Gadgenagar police station tested positive. Official sources said that this Paradise Colony resident complained of back pain, cough, cold and fever after having played a major role in removing two Habib Nagar cases to Covid hospital on May 14.

Health administration launched containment and contact tracing efforts in Paradise Colony as well as at Gadgenagar police station. A new case, the fifth one, came from Qureshi Nagar in Badnera when a 23-year-old driver tested positive days after returning from Nainital. His 45-year-old mother has been put in isolation.

Amravati’s count of 101 comprises 13 deaths, 62 recovered, two in Nagpur for treatment and 24 active cases in Covid ward here.

451,['17/05/2020'],Alarm bells as SARI patients from non-hotspots testing +ve for corona,"Nagpur: The fifth Covid-19 victim from Nagpur, a 65-year-old man from Gaddigodam who died at GMCH Covid Hospital on Saturday, neither had travel history nor contact with any positive patient. Admitted on May 14, he was a patient of Severe Acute Respiratory Illness (SARI).

Many patients of SARI being reported from non-contamination zones across Vidarbha have also tested positive for Covid-19, causing a major cause for the health authorities.

Nagpur has recorded two deaths of SARI patients who tested positive for Covid-19. Out of the 38 victims of Covid-19 in Vidarbha so far, seven were SARI patients — three in Akola, and two each in Amravati and Nagpur.

On May 15 alone, four patients of SARI were admitted to GMCH, Nagpur. They included a 65-year-old woman from Hiwari Nagar, 26-year-old youth from Manohar Nagar, 75-year-old man from Surendra Nagar and a man from Ramtek. Fortunately, none of them tested Covid-19 positive on May 16.

According to pulmonologist Dr Rajesh Swarnkar, if SARI patients testing positive have no known Covid contact and not coming from hotspot, it signifies that we have community transmission of the disease now.

“We are not able to do community surveillance or screening to find out community prevalence of Covid as we still don’t have Rapid Antibody Tests. We probably didn’t do enough testing during lockdown,” he said.

If any of the SARI patients from non-hotspot zones tests positive for Covid-19, the entire locality would be declared a contamination zone.

This has happened in case of Jawahar Nagar in Manewada. On May 9, a 55-year-old SARI patient from the area tested Covid-19 positive. His family members were quarantined and area was sealed.

Two of his close contacts were tested for Covid-19. On May 16, two women from his family tested positive. Now, all three are admitted in Covid hospital.

“SARI is one of the most common causes of death. There are many reasons behind SARI. Covid-19 is one of them. Every patient of SARI is tested for Covid-19 as per guidelines. But that doesn’t mean everyone is infected. At Super Specialty Hospital, we are now planning a research on how many SARI patients in Nagpur or Vidarbha are infected with coronavirus and its impact,” said Dr Sushant Meshram, head of department of pulmonary medicine, GMCH Nagpur.

As per present guidelines, all hospitalized patients with SARI showing symptoms like fever and cough and or shortness of breath are screened for Covid-19.

In Nagpur, more than 55 SARI patients admitted in Mayo and GMCH have been tested for Covid-19. Six of them have tested positive so far.

Facts about SARI

Only 1.8% of total SARI patients test positive for Covid-19

Covid-19 positivity is higher among males and patients aged above 50 years

As per the SOP, all SARI cases in Covid, non-Covid and private hospitals need to be isolated

Tests such as random blood sugar, electrocardiogram, chest X-ray, complete blood count, serum creatinine, Truenat/CB-NAAT are conducted

If the patient tests negative, he/she is shifted to a non-Covid ward

On testing positive, patient is admitted in Covid hospital and treated symptomatically

Those who reported to the centre located near Cotton Market said all teachers were clamouring near the main desk, and no officials were present to ensure that crowding does not happen.

A group of teachers shared photos and videos from the spot. People can be seen standing very close to each other, sometimes even pushing to reach the desk where their duty specifics were available. “We have been hearing continuously from the government that Covid distancing is to be maintained. But nothing like that was happening at this location — which is being managed by the government itself,” said a teacher.

Another teacher said that the summer heat and threat of the virus was making it worse for them. “We teachers are always at the forefront for everything. We are sent for census and elections; this ration card duty is the new addition. We are not sure how it will all be done, as teachers supposedly have to visit door-to-door to get the registrations done,” said the teacher.

For those already suffering from diabetes and cardiovascular diseases, there is an increased threat from the virus. A teacher said, “I am a diabetic and have medical records for the past decade to prove this. I reached out to the authorities and explained my health situation, but they refused to entertain my application for relief.”

Madhusudhan Mude, president of Headmasters Association (Nagpur district) said, “Teachers are always ready to serve the government. All they expect is that basic facilities be made available to them. There should have been somebody present to ensure enough distance is maintained between teachers. We will definitely take this issue up with the authorities.”

As per Jadhav, Mahagaon tehsil in Yavatmal district is one of the largest tomato-producing areas in the state.

Tomato growers took 1.5 quintals of tomatoes to Wardha market on Saturday, but there were no takers for them, leading to heavy loss for farmers.

456,['17/05/2020'],Kitchen newbies cook up a storm of injuries,"Ranchi: While the stay-home order is helping the health authorities contain the spread of the novel coronavirus, it is also having some unintended consequences: Several amateur cooks hitting the kitchen either out of boredom or for survival are sustaining petty injuries while they chop, mince and fry their way to rustle up their favourite dishes.

Just last week, Ranchi-based photographer Shubham Ghosh learnt that cooking isn’t really a snap and paid for picking up the cleaver with a pound of flesh.

“The domestic help has not been coming for more than a month. After spending many days delivering essentials to the needy, I decided it was time to take a break and help out my mother in the kitchen. I started by chopping some greens, but ended up in a puddle of blood as I shaved off a chunk of flesh from my palm. While the wound has healed — it has left a nasty scar and the skin is still tender — the ego is yet to recover… I have been banned from any sort of chopping duty,” said the 21-year-old.

Many other kitchen newbies have left behind a trail of minor disasters and the aftermath of their mission in the kitchen have made it to the pharmacies, if not the dining table.

Isha Gupta (25) wears the ‘Calamity Jane’ badge with a sense of pride and admits the status of her relationship with cooking oil is “complicated at best”. Not a regular with the stove by any stretch of imagination, the Khelgaon-based public relations professional took up cooking with gusto as she tried to keep herself fruitfully engaged while she stayed in.

“I cannot count the number of times I have ended up with minor burns while tempering hot oil during the lockdown. Once, the utensil I use had residual and it starts sputtering, giving me a blister on the back of my hand. Another time, I used a wet spoon to temper the oil. It is basic kitchen work, but I made a mess of it,” she said.

While pesky burns and small nicks are a part of any session with the stove, a few have come close to causing more extensive damage.

Nitesh Singh, a rural development consultant with an NGO, almost set his house on fire while he lolled about in the kitchen. “I have this habit of clicking the lighter absent-mindely all the time. A few weeks ago, I was on the phone while I was trying to hustle up a snack. My roommate came running and said I needed to stop playing with the lighter and reprimanded me for trying to burn the house down,” said the 28-year-old from Niwaranpur locality.

It’s easy to forget the kitchen can be a dangerous place, especially for those not used to cooking and distraction mixed with a lack of expertise is a perfect recipe for an accidents. Newbies should take abundant precaution while rustling up a dish or even helping the family clean up the used utensils.

Dr Amar Jyoti Bihari advises amateurs to wear gloves while cooking. “Occasional chef should use utensils with longer handles to avoid oil spills. They must also keep in mind that dishwashing soaps are harder than normal ones and could lead to skin irritations for those not used to it. Those helping the family do the dishes should wear gloves to avoid rashes and fungal infections,” he said.

It contains statistics, fake-news busters, messages, mobile apps, helpline numbers, analysis by the state war room and details about clinical centres.This portal has a dashboard, which provides analyses of data on positive, discharged and deceased patients along with travel history. It gets periodic updates from the health, information and public relations departments, disaster management authority, and war room.The government has devised a real-time data collection framework, through which information indexed at district, town, panchayat, village and ward levels can be collated and analysed. This deciphering of real-time data helps in making quick decisions in the battle against coronavirus.The Covid monitoring tool registers patient data at various levels, keeping a track of treatment cycles of those who visited fever clinics, quarantine centres, supervised isolation centres and Covid hospitals, test results, and home quarantine cases.In addition to tests and treatment information, consumables, health-case inventory, beds, status and availability of critical equipment such as ventilators and PPEs are also tracked.The crowdsourcing monitoring tool facilitates instant information gathering from 22,800 private medical establishments and over 41,000 drugs stores. “This will help us capture ILI and SARI cases in the state,” Rajan said. “Private medical establishments can log in and report the cases they have treated in the day. This information lead to easy follow-up and tracing of suspect cases.”Drug and pharmacy stores can also use the system to provide details of people buying medicines for flu or cough, so that suspected cases of ILI and SARI can may be proactively traced and treated before complications occur.Meanwhile, monitoring and mapping of migrant workers’ data is being done using a different app.",bengaluru,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-75783636,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-134320,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/new-tech-solutions-aiding-karnatakas-battle-against-covid-19/articleshow/75782619.cms

459,['17/05/2020'],Cop kills Amdanga brothers over land row,"Representative Image

AMDANGA (NORTH 24 PARGANAS ): Two brothers in their mid-30s died and three others were injured after a constable from the Bidhannagar commissionerate fired at them around 11.30pm on Friday.

Santosh Patra, a special security guard of the ADCP, surrendered at the commissionerate office on Saturday afternoon. His service revolver, from which he reportedly fired 4-5 rounds, was seized.

“He will be produced in a Barasat court on Sunday. We suspect a longtime rivalry between two neighbouring families over a land dispute and subsequent alleged molestation led to the murders. The accused will be interrogated after being remanded in police custody,” a senior district officer said.

Sources said the shooting took place while five youths, including brothers Sumanta and Arup Mondal, were chatting at the temple courtyard at Taraberia’s Panchanantala after dinner.

“Patra was standing at a distance in the dark. He rushed to the youths and threatened the brothers with dire consequences if they did not leave the spot. Following a brawl, Patra whipped out his revolver and fired several rounds at the duo. The three others were also injured while trying to run for cover. Soon after, Patra fled,” a trader said.

On hearing shots, residents rushed to the spot to find the brothers lying in a pool of blood. They were rushed to Barasat district hospital with chest and abdomen injuries. Arup was declared brought dead while Sumanta died immediately after being admitted.

Sources said Patra and his family were engaged in a feud with the Mondals over a land dispute and other issues. “Both families claimed a farmland at Tentulia. The brothers also allegedly passed lewd comments at Patra’s wife while the Mondals would say Patra made obscene gestures at their wives. A few days ago, the brothers had thrashed Patra after their wives were allegedly molested. Neighbours resolved the issue but we never imagined the constable would kill the brothers for revenge,” a woman said.

Barrackpore BJP MP Arjun Singh , who visited the spot on Saturday morning and spoke to the bereaved families, claimed the victims were BJP supporters. “The brothers were active party supporters. We will pay each of the two families Rs 5 lakh and the injured will get Rs 2 lakh. The law-and-order situation in West Bengal has worsened. The shooting apparently proves this. I have demanded an immediate inquiry and exemplary punishment for the killer,” Singh told TOI.

Barasat SP Abhijit Banerjee, however, said: “Though the motive behind the murders could not be ascertained, Patra claimed during interrogation that his wife had been sexually assaulted by the victims.”

PURULIA: Milan Baddakar (22) left home in Purulia ’s Dumdumi last October to work at a marble factory in Rajasthan so that he could send money for the treatment of his father, a tuberculosis patient.

Chandan Rajwar (21), also from Dumdumi, dropped out of college and became a factory worker so that his family wasn’t deprived of two square meals a day. The two young men were among four migrant workers from Purulia killed on their way home in a highway accident near UP’s Auraiya on Saturday that also claimed 20 others.

Like Milan and Chandan, Ajit Chandra Mahato (36) and Ganesh Rajwar (28) too worked at the marble factory in Mela area of Jaipur. While Milan and Ganesh had joined last October, Chandan took up the job in September and Ajit in February. Ganesh’s family lives in Jhalmamro in Purulia’s Joypur and Ajit hails from Kotshila in Jhalda. Another worker, identified as Sheikh, from Murshidabad is among the dead.

Bereaved family members said the factory stopped operations after the lockdown was announced on March 24. The four men lived at a makeshift shelter on the premises till May 14, but then like hundreds of other migrants decided to walk home.

Rajasthan Police arranged a limestone truck to ferry them along with workers from different states. Reports indicate their vehicle rammed into a stationary truck, also ferrying migrants, on NH-19.

Milan’s mother Subhashi was inconsolable. “My husband has TB, which is why my son went to Rajasthan to earn Rs 8,000 a month. He sent money home for his father’s treatment. He called us before boarding the truck and now I will never see him again,” she sobbed.

Chandan’s brother Debashis said he too worked at the same factory, but returned home in January. “My brother was a BA second year student at JK College when he had to drop out and take up the job for Rs 9,000 a month. He wanted to support the family and now he’s gone. We are numb with shock.”

Bhattacharya, who had refused the chairman’s post on Friday, is now willing to take charge.

The new board with Bhattacharya as chairman has seven other mayor-in-council members, in line with the arrangements made for Kolkata Municipal Corporation . The government has dropped the five Trinamool councillors Bhattacharya had objected to, calling it a deviation from the general formula. It followed the Kolkata formula in a host of municipalities such as Jalpaiguri , Tufanganj , Joynagar-Mazilpur, Rampurhat, Uluberia and Gayeshpur.

“The state government had a made a difference for Siliguri, sparking a public outcry. It is good the minister has taken back the discriminatory notification. There is a need to continue with municipal services during the pandemic. I spoke to CPM state secretary Surjya Kanta Mishra following Saturday’s development. I am ready to take charge and will work with all concerned, including the opposition,” Bhattacharya said.

KOLKATA: Even as L 57, the latest Landing Craft Utility (LCU) by Garden Reach Shipbuilders and Engineers (GRSE) was being commissioned at Port Blair in the Andamans on Friday, three other warships built by the shipyard in Kolkata came to mind. The INS Magar, INS Airavat and INS Shardul are participating in the evacuation of stranded Indians on foreign shores as part of Op Samudra Setu. All three are amphibious warships of the Navy that are used for beaching as well as Humanitarian Aid and Disaster Relief (HADR) operations.

“The roles played by these three warships, along with the INS Jalashwa, have been crucial in providing relief and hope to thousands of Indians waiting to return home amid the worldwide Covid-19 pandemic. While INS Magar and INS Jalashwa evacuated Indians from the Maldives, INS Shardul and INS Airavat travelled to the UAE for this purpose. Earlier this year, INS Shardul sailed to Madagascar with relief materials,” an official in the Navy said.

L 57 is seventh in a series of eight LCUs being built by GRSE for the Navy. This was the 103rd ship developed by the shipyard. These LCUs are smaller in size than the INS Magar, Shardul or Airavat, but their role is also extremely crucial for amphibious operations. The design of these Mark-IV LCUs are in-house and they have nearly 90% indigenous content. Their primary role is the transportation and deployment of Main Battle Tanks, armoured vehicles, troops and equipment from ship to shore. These ships can accommodate 216 personnel.

“The GRSE now has an order book of nearly Rs 27,000 crore. The defence shipyard, which has delivered the largest number of warships to the Navy and Coast Guard is currently engaged in design and manufacture of advanced vessels like stealth frigates,” a GRSE official said.

The return flight will reach Kolkata around noon with 169 Indians stranded in Dhaka,” a Kolkata airport official said. Sources in the airline said the fare for the 40-minute flight is around Rs 8,000.On Friday, the Bengal government and the ministry of external affairs were engaged in a Twitter spat with the MEA, which in reply to the state’s charge of non-cooperation, claimed it was still awaiting the state’s nod to repatriate 3,700 international fliers to Kolkata. In response, the state home secretary uploaded letters the state had sent to the Centre stating that it had made all necessary arrangements to receive the fliers.The maiden flight has raised hopes of more such repatriation to Kolkata from other cities across the world where people from Bengal and other states in the east are stranded. Parents of students in the UK and Singapore have again pleaded with the government to facilitate flights so that their children can return home. Travel Agents Federation of India chairman (east) Anil Punajbi said repatriation flights should operate to Kolkata from London, Dubai , Singapore and Bangkok as there were several hundred from Kolkata and other cities in the region who are stranded abroad. Punjabi claimed with both students and tourists from Bengal stuck in different parts of the world, the number awaiting repatriation to Bengal would be much higher than the 3,700 quoted by the MEA in its tweet on Friday“There are around 700 Indians in medical colleges in Dhaka, around 300 from Kolkata alone. Five of us received a commmunique from the Indian high commission to book tickets. Others are anxiously awaiting their turn,” said Sounak Ghosh, a third year student at Delta Medical College who will be on board the Dhaka-Kolkata flight. Ghosh, who lives in Kalyani , borrowed 10,000 taka to buy the flight ticket.All those fly in are required to get into compulsory institution quarantine for 14 days; home quarantine is not an option. The returnees can either pay and get quarantined at earmarked hotels or opt for free quarantine at government facilities.The state government, which had earlier reserved 750-odd hotel rooms for quarantine, has asked the Hotel and Restaurant Association of Eastern India to add another 650 rooms to the quarantine inventory to prepare for a large number of returnees from abroad.“The additional 650 rooms will be in luxury hotels like Taj Bengal, Hyatt Regency, Novotel, Swissôtel, Vedic Village Spa Resort, The Elgin Fairlawn, Lemon Tree Premier, Ibis Kolkata, The Sonnet Kolkata, and Pipal Tree. We have negotiated a discounted rate of over 50%,” said HRAEI secretary Sudesh Poddar. The tariff will include meals. Earlier, Lalit Great Eastern, Holiday Inn, Pride Plaza, Westin, Stadel, Vivanta and Fairfield by Marriot had agreed to rent rooms for paid quarantine service.State home secretary Alapan Bandyopadhyay, on Saturday said, those opting for hotel quarantine could hire app cab services at the airport to travel to the hotel while those who wish to stay at government quarantine centres for free will be transported to the facility by bus.",kolkata,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-75784893,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-152899,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/city-finally-on-vande-list-1st-flight-from-dhaka-on-mon/articleshow/75783173.cms

Mumbai has reported a high number of coronavirus infections and a strict lockdown is in effect there. Many hotel employees are out of work and struggling.

Avinash Pol, a member of a group that’s trying to help stranded natives of Karnataka, has written to Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, seeking his intervention.

“People from the coast are among the most well-mannered. For nearly two months, they have waiting for permission from the Dakshina Kannada administration to return home. Associated with the hotel industry, most of them are jobless,” said Avinash, who hails from Belagavi. “Mangalureans from Navi Mumbai, Mumbai suburbs, Kalyan and Thane have approached us for help. They are drained physically and mentally and are worried about their safety.”

The group has helped people return to Vijayapura and Belagavi. “We urge the Dakshina Kannada administration to grant permission to those waiting at the earliest,” he said.

Satish Kotian, a hotel manager in Chembur, Mumbai, said the situation was very challenging for the industry. “The city is densely populated and maintaining social distance is a challenge. Hotels may remain closed for a longer time. There are six families from Belthangady waiting for permits to go back home. We have also approached local MLA Harish Poonja for help,” he said.

Most of the workers don’t have vehicles and public transport is shut in Mumbai. “Special travel arrangements would have to be made. But spending over 20 hours in a bus is not advisable at this point,” Kotian said.

Dakshina Kannada deputy commissioner Sindhu B Rupesh said as institutional quarantine was mandatory for all returnees, passes were being cleared in phases. The maximum number of applications for interstate movement is from Maharashtra.

MANGALURU: The dramatic steps taken to combat Covid-19 across the world have introduced almost three generations to the implications of what living life in a ‘quarantine’ entails. Words such as isolation and containment, along with quarantine, will be definitive terms associated with the experience of the young. However, for thousands of elderly citizens in their 70s and 80s in the country, quarantine, without the term hardly ever used, was an essential part of their growing-up years; the disease they dreaded was small pox.

In the 1940s through the 1970s, Urwa Market, now incorporated within the city limits of Mangaluru , lay on the outskirts of the coastal town, and it was here that around 25 sheds were erected to house those suffering from small pox. A solitary shed still remains, a visible reminder of those terrifying times.

The Karnataka state gazetteer, published in 1971, shows that the region was struck by cholera, small pox, malaria and many other fevers. Although cholera accounted for more fatalities, the administration quarantined only those who had small pox. “People in infected areas are inoculated, and are advised against entertaining relatives and friends. Most cases are coming chiefly from adjoining districts and Bombay,” the gazetteer noted. In 1945, the small pox epidemic claimed the lives of 254 in the erstwhile South Kanara district, while the number dropped to 49 in ’59, to 41 in ’60 before ultimately coming down to zero in ’70.

Former corporator and secretary of Besant Institutions Devananda Pai, 68, recalled days from his boyhood when Urwa Market was forbidden territory. “A thrashing awaited us at home if we ventured there. Those who were quarantined were largely thought of as being on their deathbeds. Most people who were isolated did not reunite with their families,” Pai added.

Christine Lobo, who will turn 100 on June 24, recalled her father telling her about the epidemic sweeping through Kulashekar in 1890. “My father told me that small pox claimed lives every day in Kulashekar. The then parish priest Father Alexander Dubois, who presided over the final rites, would be forced to dig the graves himself when he could not find anyone to do so. Since I lived in Chikkamagaluru in the 1940s, I never caught small pox, though I have suffered from malaria,” Christine said.

Jessy Castelino, 74, wife of former mayor PM Castelino, was a class VIII student when the small pox epidemic struck the district. “I lived in Kinnigoli, around 30km from Mangaluru. It was a small town but was shut for eight days, and were not even allowed to go outside and play,” she said.

Will Shivajinagar go the Padarayanapura way or is the situation under control?Padarayanapura, whose demography is similar to that of Shivajinagar, has reported 54 cases so far, and faces the risk of a potential community transmission.Health experts with the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) insisted that things were under control in in Shivajinagar.“All the 30 cases reported in Shivajinagar are linked to 73 residents, who stay in an already sealed four-storeyed building in Chandni Chowk area. Unlike in Padarayanapura, the transmission of virus in Shivajinagar has happened from a single source, and primary and secondary contacts are confined to the building,” a BBMP official said.The residents of the building came under the scanner after one occupant, a man, tested positive. The man, Karnataka’s Covid-19 patient number 653, worked in a hotel where a nurse with the infection had been quarantined. The nurse worked at a private hospital, where a doctor contracted the infection from a patient with severe acute respiratory syndrome. “Except the doctor and the nurse, all others who have turned positive for Covid-19 in Shivajinagar are from the same building and are neighbours of Patient number 653,” the official said.Dr Siddappaji, a senior health official with BBMP, said 73 contacts of the patient had been under a watch. “Chandni Chowk Road was sealed, and we quarantined and tested the 73 contacts according to the protocol. The weekend spike in Covid-19 cases only confirms that our contract tracing and quarantine efforts have been effective,” Dr Siddappaji said.But he said the situation would have be monitored closely. “These secondary contacts could have set off an infection trail,” he added.As Shivajinagar has a much bigger network of lanes and bylanes and cheek-by-jowl tenements than Padarayanapura, BBMP will step up surveillance to identify people vulnerable to Covid-19, he said.Buildings on and off Chandini Chowk Road are separated by barely a feet and every house has at least half a dozen residents, which makes it difficult to enforce social distancing, according to chief health officer Dr Vijayendra B.",bengaluru,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-75783667,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-149442,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/spike-in-coronavirus-cases-at-shivajinagar-worries-health-officials/articleshow/75782968.cms

But when her mother suffered from food poisoning last week, she struggled to rush her to hospital as cabs were not available. A hand-pulled rickshaw came to her rescue.Anil Singh, who had stopped boarding the hand-pulled rickshaw several years ago, has been using it to ferry LPG cylinders after the delivery boy refused to carry it to his residence on Madan Mohan Burman Street, a containment zone.The humble hand-pulled rickshaw, a form of transport on its last legs and sometimes referred to as a symbol of India’s colonial past, has suddenly become a saviour for locked-down Kolkata as the city gropes for last-mile transport solutions in response to an unforeseen emergency situation.Bodies glistening with sweat in the wilting heat, the frail and tanned rickshaw pullers are taking the sick to hospitals, hauling LPG cylinders and ferrying essential supplies to households. In many pockets of the city, where several cases of Covid-19 have been detected, hand-pulled rickshaws are now the only mode of transport.“I realised the importance of these rickshaws when my mother fell ill. I didn’t know how to take her to the hospital as cabs are not plying. I thought the rickshaw puller would charge double the fare, but I was surprised when he not only asked for the actual fare but also offered to wait outside till a doctor checked my mother,” said Poddar.A cop in central Kolkata said rickshaws have come to their rescue too as people were dialling local police stations requesting to ferry a sick person to hospital or fetch an LPG cylinder. Sniffing business opportunity in these times of hardship, the rickshaw pullers reach the markets in central and north central parts of the city early in the morning, their faces wrapped in masks. “People are now purchasing in bulk due to lockdown. They cannot carry so much themselves and use our services. We are also earning some money,” said Raju Paswan, a rickshaw puller outside Tiretta Market in central Kolkata.“I have helped ferry so many people to clinics and hospitals for food poisoning and other ailments. Even though it’s my job, people have thanked me profusely and even tipped me, which shows how helpless they are in the current situation,” said Mohammad Islam, a rickshaw puller in Bowbazar Close to 1,000 hand-pulled rickshaws still ply in pockets of central and north Central Kolkata even though issue of licences stopped in the mid-1990s. In the past few decades, there have been cries of banning this “inhuman” mode of transport. But every time the city’s streets are flooded during monsoons, or a natural or man-made calamity strikes, this non-mechanised and non-polluting mode of transport comes to the rescue of citizens.“These rickshaw pullers are also frontline Covid warriors because they are ferrying the sick and entering dangerous zones to deliver groceries and LPG cylinders when others are refusing to do it. We request the police to let them ply as they are a lifeline in the time of pandemic. When this phase is over, the government must think about providing better working conditions to the rickshaw-pullers,” said Mukhtar Ali of the All Bengal Rickshaw Union.",kolkata,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-75784558,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-238000,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/humble-hand-pulled-rickshaws-turn-saviour-in-citys-containment-zones/articleshow/75783189.cms

To facilitate movement of the passengers, Bengal has also appointed 17 nodal officers for each of the originating states.

A total of nine trains carrying nearly 11,000 migrant workers will reach Bengal by Monday. The first Shramik Special trains from Maharashtra and Delhi, which left on Saturday, will reach Howrah and New Cooch Behar on Sunday afternoon. The state government has asked officials to arrange swab tests for all passengers coming from Maharashtra. Two trains from Karnataka and Telangana will also arrive on Sunday. The first train carrying back pilgrims from Haridwar will reach Howrah on Monday afternoon.

In a letter to the ministry of railways on Saturday, chief secretary Rajiva Sinha said the state is making arrangements to send 1,608 passengers to Rajasthan. Sinha had on Thursday reached out to the chief secretaries of Maharashtra, Kerala , New Delhi and Rajasthan and given them detailed plans on receiving the inbound trains.

The administration has also prepared a blueprint to manage health check-up and transport of nearly 1.25 lakh people over the next month. “This is going to be a mammoth task and some West Bengal Railway Police divisions like Siliguri GRP will have to bear bigger responsibilities. A total of 66 trains will reach Malda and Cooch Behar, and Siliguri GRP will have to manage that,” said an official at Nabanna.

Each of the special trains arriving in Bengal is carrying around 1,200 passengers and the West Bengal Railway Police requires 150 personnel to attend to them. “This will require additional manpower at some stations and we are already mobilising that,” the official said. Apart from maintaining law and order, railway police is helping passengers in deboarding, medical screening and documentation. They are also helping passengers board buses.

KOLKATA: The state government would bear the entire cost of Bengal-bound Shramik Special trains ferrying stranded migrants back home, CM Mamata Banerjee announced on Saturday.

Banerjee tweeted her government’s decision “to bear the entire cost of movement of our migrant workers by special trains from other states”. The Bengal government’s letter to the Railway Board, informing the latter of the decision, puts to rest the recent debate over sharing the cost of transport(85% by the centre and the remaining 15% by either the state government or the passenger).

The state home department on Saturday also announced Rs 2 lakh as compensation for the families of each of the four migrants from Bengal who died in a truck accident in Uttar Pradesh early on Saturday. The Bengal government has been vocal about the centre’s “lack of concern for the plight of migrants” and “the inhuman conditions they have had to endure” in their cross-country journey back to their home states.

State home secretary Alapan Bandyopadhyay said a few lakh people had applied to return to Bengal, of whom more than 1.1 lakh had already come back home. “We have provided 24,000 entry passes to people who want to return at their own cost,” he said.

“The Bengal government has been negotiating with other states. Special measures have been taken for people who are coming from states with high infection numbers (like Maharashtra, Gujarat, Delhi, Tamil Nadu and Karnataka),” state home secretary Alapan Bandyopadhayay said.

“Medical screening takes time. This has led to clogging of border check points at some places. We are planning to de-congest the borders by setting up multiple screening centres,” he added.

Banerjee’s decision to bring back Bengal migrants free of cost got her praise the CPM. “We convey our thanks to the CM and request her to expedite the process,” CPMstate secretary Surjya Kanta Mishra tweeted.

The Bengal BJP, however, felt the state government needed to requisition more trains on a daily basis. “The centre has done its duty. The state too needs to do something,” state BJP leader Sayantan Basu said. Trinamool senior and education minister Partha Chatterjee responded by saying the “vocal for local” PM should arrange for special flights for ferrying migrant workers home.

The actress is a hands-on mother to Mehr and their adorable equation has also been drawing everyone's attention on social media. Neha in an exclusive chat with ETimes TV revealed how she is managing work from home during lockdown and that husband Angad Bedi is proving to be a great help.The actress shared, ""There is no taking away from the fact that when a mother is working from home, her head is always there in her child and the child always knows that the mother is there and always accessible. So, recently in the middle of the live auditions I heard my daughter cry so I had to run away and go inside and see what happened and it was nothing, it was just a call to go to the washroom. I know a lot can be managed by my husband so we plan our timing accordingly. I know the live auditions are going to keep me busy from like 4 PM to 7 PM on alternate days, so I tell my husband that he has to be on Mehr's duty when I am away for virtual auditions. He understands it and we are big on co-parenting and that's very important to us.""Neha went on to add that her peak working hours are when her daughter is fast asleep, ""Being a mom even when you're working from home the family depends on you for a lot of things like 'koi khane ke liye poochega, koi saamaan kahan rakha hai..' so you always lose focus and you go ahead and then come back. I have kind of cracked it by knowing exactly what my daughter's time table is and I work around her routine. My peak working hours are definitely when she's asleep and when her meal time happens. Luckily, I have a little bit of help at home not much. So when she is eating I do my workout and other stuff because I love working out everyday. I just make sure I maximise my work time and my time as mom with Mehr,"" said Neha.When asked if it is a happy family time during lockdown for Angad and her, the actress said, ""Yes, I am having a great time. I have a wonderful husband who understands. I know there are high's and low's of the situations that the world is going through. The high is definitely the family time and the low is the fact that we have never experienced something like this or all the sadness that you wake up to. I wouldn't want it any other way, my most favourite people to be locked in with are definitely Angad and Mehr.""",tv,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-75781526,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-294138/75781526.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//tv/news/hindi/exclusive-roadies-judge-neha-dhupia-on-managing-work-from-home-with-one-year-old-mehr-angad-and-i-are-big-on-co-parenting/articleshow/75781444.cms
479,['17/05/2020'],How we went from FOMO to JOLO,"Joy Of Letting Go seems to be the new mantra for the Covid age as everything from underwear to makeup becomes optional. Say hello to

liberation!

For years we’ve been driven by what is commonly described as FOMO — the fear of missing out — the belief that others would hog all the fun if we don’t get out there to grab it. But the lockdown has been strangely liberating. The initial worries about where to get a wax have waned, we’ve learnt to embrace the all-forgiving pyjamas and bra-less look and hey, who cares if you’ve got a mooch on your upper lip underneath that mask, right?For Noida-based blogger, Priya Parul Singh, who has been removing hair since she was in her teens, not having to undergo the pain of waxing is one of the few pluses of isolation. “I’ve always been a hairy girl so my monthly salon visit was one of those non-negotiable rituals,” Singh says. “But I’ve become more comfortable with body hair in these two months. I’ve decided to discontinue getting my eyebrows done. I think I just fell into the beauty industry trap that they need to be perfectly arched.” Singh felt self-conscious the first time she wore a dress at home in front of her husband with hairy legs. “But since then, I’ve worn dresses and skirts many times, and now it’s not a big deal,” she says. “It’s a small trial for something I may do in the long-term.”On Instagram, the no-makeup trend has blossomed. Even Kareena Kapoor-Khan has been sharing unfiltered selfies, including one with a zit on her face. Actors are also showing off their greys, with Lara Dutta-Bhupathi posting a photo of her mane with a comment on embracing “our true selves”.It isn’t just celebrities. Bengaluru-based behaviour analyst Antara Dey Chowdhury, 41, who started greying and colouring her hair when she was 25, decided to go au naturel after trying it out in the lockdown. “Even women like me who believe we ‘chose’ colouring were actually influenced by social conditioning,” she says. But now she happily owns her grey look.When Mumbai-based digital content creator Shreemi Verma tweeted about forgetting what wearing a bra felt like after 15 days of quarantine, it resonated with a lot of women. She hopes the bra-free trend will outlive the lockdown. “After this, many women will be looking for ways to get away with not wearing a bra.” says Verma, who still likes putting on lipstick during office hours, “just to make myself feel I’m working.”Of course, there are still some who still share old selfies of their polished selves before the grey roots started peeping out and the Covid pounds piled up but for many, their unfiltered Zoom faces have come as a reality check. “Earlier we’d never share pictures with an unplucked eyebrow but now everyone is on video calls and sharing real pictures all the time,” says Noida-based fashion writer Nivi Shrivastava, adding that the “the new world should be without painful bras, corsets, heels, body shapers, waxing, plucking…”Just the freedom from not having to fret about which clothes are “appropriate” and “safe” is a relief. “Women have to do a lot of these mini-calculations before going out like should I wear shorts if I am driving alone,” says Anika Verma, who works on digital campaigns for a Delhi-based NGO. “That pressure is gone, and strangely, I feel very relaxed”British cultural critic and thinker John Berger famously wrote about the effect of an external male gaze on women: ""She has to survey everything she is and everything she does because how she appears to men, is of crucial importance for what is normally thought of as the success of her life. Her own sense of being in herself is supplanted by a sense of being appreciated as herself by another...""Debjani Mukherjee, a researcher at IIT Bombay , says it is probably for the first time that women are looking at themselves with their own gaze, and not other people’s gazes. Mukherjee, who is also an animation filmmaker, has been working on a series of five paintings titled ‘The Nature Self ’, inspired by her own journey of accepting ‘flaws’ such as body and facial hair, stomach flab and pimples, during this time. “The lockdown has given us more time for self-reflection on why we need to conform to certain body images and rethink advertising and consumerism,” says Mukherjee, who has stopped waxing, threading and colouring her hair.",home,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-75779905,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-227641,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//home/sunday-times/how-we-went-from-fomo-to-jolo/articleshow/75779199.cms

At present, imported nylon-flocked and viscose swabs are part of the viral transport medium (VTM) kits used for Covid-19 testing. The swabs imported from US and China cost between Rs 20 and Rs 30 apiece. But even their supply started drying up in last week of April. The desi polyester swabs will cost between Rs 1.4 and Rs 3.5 each.Rahul Jain, co-owner of Suparshva, Tulips, told TOI, “Until March, we were just a personal hygiene company. In the second week of April, we were asked by the government if we could make indigenous swabs for Covid-19 testing. Within 10 days, we converted a small part of our 20-million cotton earbud capacity unit in Ghaziabad for polyester swabs. Since May 5, we have dispatched 3.6 million swabs to VTM manufacturers.”This could help VTM manufacturers expand testing and produce cheaper kits. “Local production of swabs can reduce cost of testing while increasing its spread,” said Vishal G Warke, director, R&D cell culture, HiMedia Viral Transport Media.Meanwhile, Adi Enterprises, which manufactures ear buds for Johnson and Johnson, also started production of swabs on May 6. Sandeep Makkar, managing director, Johnson and Johnson Medical India , told TOI that for the Made-in-India swabs, Reliance provided the raw material and Johnson & Johnson India provided pro-bono scientific expertise and R&D. “Manufacturing of the test swabs in a record seven days from conceptualisation to production under the Make-In India initiative required ingenuity and rapid action.”",india,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-75783452,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-210905,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/2-firms-get-govt-nod-to-produce-desi-swabs-for-cheaper-covid-19-test-kits/articleshow/75783445.cms

GHAZIABAD: A Loni resident had to allegedly run to a nearby hospital carrying his wife, who had suffered burn injuries, as no ambulance arrived at the spot even after 20 minutes of calling the helpline. The woman was subsequntly referred to another hospital, but she died before she could be shifted there.

A video, in which some police personnel can be seen patrolling the area but are not helping the man who could be seen trying to save his wife, has been doing the rounds on social media.

Electrician Vinay Pathak ’s wife Sushma (33) allegedly set herself on fire after pouring kerosene on herself in the bathroom of her house on Friday following an argument with Vinay.

“Around 11 am, I was offering prayers when some neighbours came and told me that smoke was bellowing out of my bathroom window. When I went there, I found Sushma surrounded by flames. I managed to take her out of the bathroom,” said Vinay.

“I called for an ambulance. But even after 20 minutes, it did not come. I wrapped her in a bedsheet and then started running towards a nearby hospital. There the doctors referred her to GTB hospital in Delhi. But she died soon after,” Vinay said.

In the video, some cops can be seen seated inside a PRV near Vinay’s house. Sanjeev Kumar , the head commander of the PRV told his senior that they did not interfere, as the hospital was 100-150 m away and it takes hardly a couple of minutes to reach.

SP (rural) Neeraj Kumar Jadaun said a probe is on. “Action will be taken after the investigation,” he added.

GHAZIABAD: Amit Khate, the SHO of Indirapuram police station, has been suspended in the wake of the Auraiya road accident that claimed the lives of at least 24 migrant workers in the early hours of Saturday.

Officials said the SHO was suspended after it came to light that one of the heavy vehicles — a supply lorry — involved in the accident had passed through Makanpur area in Indirapuram, with 16 migrant workers on board. A larger trailer truck carrying some 50 people had rammed the lorry from behind.

Kalanidhi Naithani, SSP of Ghaziabad , said action has been taken against Khate following the chief minister’s order. “A departmental enquiry will also be initiated against the Indirapuram SHO,” he said.

Ajay Shankar Pandey, the district magistrate, said he had clearly instructed the police to ensure that no migrant worker leave the district on foot or in any vehicle. “I had told the police to send migrant workers to shelter homes till buses or trains are arranged to send them to their hometown,” he said.

“SHOs in Ghaziabad have been told that they would be held responsible in case of any violation of the DM’s order. The city magistrate and transport department have also been asked to make a team for checking all trucks passing through the district,” Pandey said.

Sources said that preliminary investigation also revealed that some migrant workers had hired the supply truck from Delhi to return to Sagar district in MP.

Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath early on Saturday ordered the suspension of two station house officers (SHOs) and sought an explanation from senior police officials in Agra and Mathura in connection with the accident.

487,['17/05/2020'],"Lack of hands, strike: Why wheat procurement hit hurdle in Haryana","Initial efforts

Challenges

GURUGRAM: Having hit several hurdles in the past 25 days, Haryana has been able to procure around 65% of the wheat from mandis but facilitated only 29% of payments to middlemen and farmers . This is in sharp contrast to the situation in Punjab , where wheat procurement is almost double that of Haryana despite the hurdles being similar.Both Haryana and Punjab had been battling the same set of challenges in the procurement process — shortage of workers , restrictions on transportation and limited entry of farmers to mandis. Though the plan of response was similar, too, Punjab managed to iron out differences much faster than its neighbour.The difference in approach lay in the coordination with middlemen, management of workers and the resultant support from agents, said farmers’ unions. “It’s (Haryana’s) a clear case of mismanagement and lack of planning. Tussle with commission agents, lifting issues, shortage of labourers and non-payment, among others, have been major failures this season. Also, many of the mandis are not functional,” said Rajiv Godra of the All India Kisan Sangharsh Coordination Committee.Despite a staggered start amid challenges brought in by the lockdown, Punjab was relatively quicker in addressing its issues. With social distancing and other safety protocols in place, Punjab increased the number of procurement centres — around 280 for mustard and close to 1,800 for wheat. This made it easier for farmers to visit the mandis and the footfall, too, was divided evenly. School grounds, stadiums, rice mills and other such public places were converted into procurement centres. Helplines were activated for updates on timing and the location of procurement and token system introduced for farmers.It is only now that the Haryana government has picked up pace in its procurement process. “Wheat procurement has been happening under extremely challenging circumstances. We had been preparing for this. First, the meri fasal, mera bora scheme helped us in mapping the farmers in the state. After that, the number of procurement centres was increased four times. Through helpline numbers, our officials ensured the proper arrival of farmers, quick auctioning, lifting and payment to the arhtiyas. Yes, there were some initial challenges but we overcame all of that. Today, we are in a position where 6.6 million metric tonnes of wheat has been procured,” Haryana additional chief secretary (agriculture and farmers’ welfare and cooperation) Sanjeev Kaushal said.Despite these efforts, the procurement exercise left many a farmers and arhtiyas disgruntled in the state. Differences in the approach of the Punjab and Haryana governments were evident from the beginning itself. While Punjab began procurement from April 15, Haryana started it five days later.Only a few days into the exercise, procurement came to a halt in Haryana. From shortage of labourers to repeated strikes by arhtiyas, and from tardy lifting of produce from the mandis to the failure of the government in keeping its promise of a 72-hour payment window, procurement hit several hurdles.The process hit the first roadblock when the government sought to bring in transparency in the minimum support price. The move was strongly opposed by the commission agents, who feared losing control over the farmers. In Punjab, however, the government used the network of the arhtiyas to fix issues of shortage of labourers and ensure farmers arrived at the mandis in a systematic manner.In Haryana, wheat purchase had to be stopped for several days until the government bowed down and went for a compromise with the middlemen. The state government wanted to tweak the system of paying the middlemen first and then the farmers. It, instead, wanted to pay the farmers directly and sought to settle the dues of the middlemen later. The decision triggered a three-day strike by the middlemen and the entire procurement had to be stopped.A sudden spell of rain coupled with staggered lifting of produce from the mandis also hit farmers hard. A portion of the wheat that got drenched in the rain affected the weighing process as moisture content in the grain had increased.“Those who had good connections with officials didn’t suffer, but marginal farmers had to let go 3-4kg from every 50kg sack. It was mismanagement on the part of the administration, but it is the farmers who had to pay the penalty,” said Dharambir Singh of All India Kisan Sabha.Lifting of crop from the mandis is managed by Hafed and Haryana Warehousing Corporation (HWC). They, in turn, have over 450 contractors to take the produce to warehouses. This time, however, the contractors have pleaded helplessness in providing timely services due to the shortage of labourers.Moreover, despite the Haryana government’s promise of paying arthiyas and farmers within 72 hours of procurment, only 29% of the payments have been processed so far. The 23,000 registered arhtiyas in the state have raised a demand of Rs 12, 372 crore, but only Rs 3, 709 crore has been made so far to over 12,500 middlemen.PK Das, additional chief secretary (food, civil supplies and consumer affairs), said, “We wanted to bring transparency and give greater control to farmer over the price of their produce. Arhtiyas took it the other way round and feared disruption of their networking with farmers. We negotiated with them as transparency cannot be done away with. Also, lifting was an issue due to shortage of workers. But we have fixed that now. About 40-45 lakh tonnes of wheat had been lifted till Wednesday.”Asked about the delay in payments, Das said, “We have come up with hybrid system to make payments. All payments till April 25 have been cleared. Payments for the produce purchased between April 26 and May 5 is being facilitated and will be completed in couple of days.",gurgaon,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-75784266,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-223943,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/lack-of-hands-strike-why-wheat-procurement-hit-hurdle-in-haryana/articleshow/75783039.cms

Stations and coaches have been marked with seats where people can sit or stand. Stickers have been placed on alternate seats, where no one will be allowed to sit. Those standing will have to stand in front of the vacant seats that have stickers. One-metre spacing will be maintained at the frisking zone and ticket counters.Crowds inside trains, as well as at stations and platforms, will be monitored through CCTV cameras. A screening team may restrict entry at the station if they are found to be excessive. In case of an emergency, halts at stations with more crowds may be skipped after an announcement inside the train by the train operator and at the station by the station controller. Additional security personnel will also be deployed at every station to ensure prescribed social distancing and crowd management.For payments, instead of currency notes, the digital mode will be preferred, either through online payments or point of sale (POS). Use of smart cards and the NMRC app will also be encouraged.Ritu Maheshwari, managing director, NMRC, said the trains will initially run at a reduced frequency of 15 minutes. “The ridership trends will be analysed and if required, the frequency will be modified. We have been sanitising station premises and trains and maintaining coaches. We are ready to start operations as and when the ministry permits,” said Maheshwari.She added that initially the elevators will not be operational. However, in case of requests from senior citizens and physically challenged passengers, they will be made available with some conditions, such as maximum of three people allowed inside at a time.NMRC connects Noida and Greater Noida through 21 stations. At the ones with less footfall and where use of footover bridge is not required, only one gate will be kept open for entry and exit. These include Sector 101, Sector 81, NSEZ, Sector 83, Sector 137, Sector 142, Sector 143, Sector 144, Sector 145, Sector 146, Sector 147, Sector 148, Alpha 1, Delta 1 and GNIDA office.At the remaining six stations with higher footfall, including Sector 51, Sector 50, Sector 76, KP-II, Pari Chowk and Depot Station, both entrance gates will be kept open.",noida,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-75782648,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-108308,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/aqua-line-awaits-nod-to-resume-masks-aarogya-setu-app-must/articleshow/75782649.cms

The first two trains that were flagged off from Dadri and Dankaur to Aurangabad and Buxar , respectively, had an occupancy of 67% each.Although no official reason was cited for the unoccupied seats, sources said many of the migrant workers had registered themselves in both Delhi and Noida, hoping at least one of the administrations would ensure their return home. A section of these workers may have boarded the trains leaving from Delhi. Also, with factories resuming operations one by one, many workers might have chosen to stay back in NCR.However, the turnout was relatively better in the evening, when two trains left for Sasaram and Siwan.A fifth train left for Bihar’s Katihar around 11.30pm. Sources in the Noida administration said since the state government was paying for the cost of tickets and food of passengers, they might eventually allow workers not registered with the jansunwai portal in trains if seats are not filled to capacity.“Either migrant workers have lost faith in the system or they are making arrangements on their own. Many from Bihar may have boarded the trains originating from Delhi. We have no way of checking if one person has got himself registered at multiple portals. Many others may have decided against leaving NCR, now that factories are opening slowly,” an official said.The UP government had paid for 2,600 passengers for the trains on Saturday morning. However, only 1,634 turned up. The trains were delayed by two hours, but there was no sign of the remaining passengers.In the evening, though, 1,500 people boarded the trains from Dadri and Dankaur.Although 80,000 people have registered with Noida to go home, there are at least 1 lakh others who are yet to be added to the list. “Given the rising number of passengers, we have requested for an extra train. Instead of four, we might run five trains. The final destination of the fifth train is being finalised,” said Suhas LY, the Noida DM.Around 11.30pm on Saturday, a train left for Katihar. The service was planned late in the evening.On Sunday, the Noida administration plans to run three trains between Dadri and Jamui, Dadri and Samastipur and Dadri and Araria. All three trains would halt at Dankaur to pick up passengers. The administration is also in talks with railway officials and the UP government to run trains to Prayagraj (Allahabad) and Gorakhpur In Ghaziabad, the second Shramik Special left with 1,200 workers for Bihar’s Araria. Passengers had assembled at the Ghanta Ghar Ram Lila Ground, where they were given the tickets in the afternoon. Unlike on Friday, when the Ghaziabad administration had to revise the departure timing thrice as they failed to manage the crowd, arrangements looked better-placed on Saturday.“Since Saturday morning, we have sent out text messages and phone calls to about 1,200 migrant labourers who had applied on the jansunwai portal,” said Sanjay Kumar , a GDA officer overlooking the operations. “By afternoon, only 728 turned up at the Ghanta Ghar ground. We realised that we can’t allow a train with so many vacant seats to leave. We sent messages to 472 other passengers and they turned up at a very short notice,” he added.The passengers were provided with tokens and then ferried to the station. “It took more than five hours to ferry all 1,200 passengers to Ghaziabad station. They were screened,” said Kumar.",noida,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-75782658,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-81441,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/as-thousands-wait-to-go-home-trains-leave-with-1/3rd-seats-empty/articleshow/75782659.cms

Meanwhile, mothers and fathers everywhere have been struggling bravely to juggle various roles — employee, domestic help and teacher — under one roof.In Gurugram, the city’s RWAs have come to the aid of the parents, stepping in to engage children through, for example, online yoga and debates, special counselling sessions and creative ways to make them aware of the novel coronavirus “Parenting is an art and a pleasurable experience which has become a little more challenging in times like these, when parents not only have to keep the children at home but also engage them in interesting ways to keep them busy,” said Rahul Dahiya, RWA secretary at IREO Skyon. “This time is the real test of parenting skills.”So, IREO Skyon’s youngest residents have been engaging online via virtual groups, and receiving mindfulness training. Still, the more each member of the family — including the children — occupies himself/herself with household chores such as washing, cleaning and cooking, the better they will be able to bond, believes Dahiya. Such, indeed, have been the positive learnings of this lockdown Out at Suncity, residents organised a talent hunt for girls and boys. The winners were rewarded by having their artworks and poems printed in Aas, the weekly e-newsletter. “Everyone was excited to take part in the painting, singing and debating competitions, for it helped lessen the burden on parents,” shared Kuldeep Rana, president, Suncity RWA.It wasn’t much different at Tulip Violet, where residents created a private group on social media, where the young ones could participate in dancing, singing and painting contests. And that wasn’t all. “On Facebook, parents upload their daily experiences with family — they would suggest children’s authors, share recipes to try out with kids, and make funny TikTok videos too,” revealed RWA president Puneet Goyal.And in IREO Uptown, the RWA conducted virtual quizzes and debating sessions to keep the children happily diverted. However, it is the kids who have led the way here, raising awareness around the virus by designing banners and posters on social distancing and hygiene. “Our Team Jashn tries to come up with novel ways to keep us occupied and out of boredom during these days,” informed RWA president Pranav Kumar.Pursuits were as fun as they were enlightening. “All efforts to keep us entertained and instil a sense of togetherness – the WhatsApp quiz was great fun and a huge success,” Kumar added.At TOI, we recognise your efforts during these difficult times, and are celebrating them through #MySocietyPride.

Thus, an estimated five million people are employed in the state in retail and are in danger of losing their livelihoods if the restrictions on shops selling non-essential items are not lifted and government support is not given to the sector.“Prolonged closure of the departmental stores and organised retail will cause irretrievable damage to millions of households. We believe measures that accord the highest priority to the public health and also bring livelihood relief to people should be considered by the government as the lockdown extends,” RAI’s chief executive Kumar Rajagopalan wrote to the CM.While the association did not share any numbers specific to Haryana, Rajagopalan told TOI that some five million people are dependent on retail for their livelihood in the state, of around 100 million people in the sector in India. “At least 25% of our members have told us that they might shut down forever in the next few months if things do not improve considerably. The government must allow the retail sector to resume with a proper standard operating procedure just like the manufacturing sector,” he said.Brands across the country are now facing the liquidity issues and are worried about their survival in the coming months.“While our revenues have come down considerably, the costs haven’t. We still have to pay the salaries, the rent and taxes. It is time that the government allowed retail to resume because even the MSMEs that it is trying to revive will not survive without the retail sector,” said Lalit Agarwal, CMD of V-Mart Retail Limited.In order to ensure the safety and well-being of workers and customers, retailers have also devised a list of safety measures.India’s leading footwear retailer Bata, for instance, has decided to quarantine shoes tried by customers. “We have decided that after a customer tries a shoe, we will disinfect and quarantine it for 72 hours, before the next customer tries it on. Additionally, we are also coming up with plastic socks that can be worn before trying out shoes,” said Sandeep Kataria, CEO and MD of Bata India.With the measures and the SOPs, retailers now hope that the government allows sale of non-essential as well as malls to reopen for a longer duration so that there is no crowding at the stores.",gurgaon,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-75784426,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-60126,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/allow-stores-in-safe-zones-to-reopen-retailers-urge-khattar/articleshow/75782724.cms
