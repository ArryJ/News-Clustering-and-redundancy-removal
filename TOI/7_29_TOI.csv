It’s a befitting tribute to a woman who gave her everything to me until her last day,” says a wistful Prem. The director who lost his mother recently to cancer, is in his hometown Maddur for the post death rites along with his family.“My mother got married rather early and dedicated her life in raising her three kids amid poverty. Not once did she complain about her life and always lived it within modest means. Even when I made it big in films, she continued being the simple villager that she is,” shares Prem.The mother sentiment has always been a major element in Prem’s films, which he attributes to being inspired by his mom. “My mother was the biggest inspiration for Jogi . Her name was Bhagyamma , which is what Arundhati Nag ’s character was called in the film. Every scene between her and Shivarajkumar was how my mother behaved with me in real life. She was the most selfless woman I’ve ever met,” states the director-actor.Three years ago, Bhagyamma was diagnosed with cancer, and although she was responding well to the treatment and seemed on the path to recovery, she had a relapse a few months ago. “Such was her blind love and innocence for me that when the doctor told her that she had breast cancer and asked her if they could go ahead with the surgery, she told them that she would do whatever her son says. She always shied away from media attention and wanted to return to our village and live there. She has been living with me and dedicating this thota to her is my tribute to my mother,” says Prem, who vowed to dedicate all his future films to his late mother. “My wife and siblings are helping me recoup from this loss and I have now decided to set up a trust in her name to help lesser privileged people with their medical needs,” he signs off.",entertainment,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-77226179,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-147209/77226179.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/kannada/movies/news/prem-my-mother-was-a-big-inspiration-for-my-films-especially-jogi/articleshow/77226181.cms

According to the makers of the upcoming Mollywood film Valatty , it is probably the first film in the country to tell its story through dogs – with canines of different breeds playing the hero, heroine, villain, sidekicks and more, and the humans are relegated to minor supporting acts.The film’s director and debutant Devan tells us, “Valatty is a story of romance. We are using real dogs and no VFX at all. For the past one year, we have been training the pups cast in the film. We had a 2.5 acre area in Kollam, where the trainers and those working on the film including me lived in a house with these pups, so that they were trained and also got acquainted with us. All of us are dog lovers, so we want to make this film in the most naturally possible way, by giving them their space and time.” The crew plans to start the shoot next month.Tomy, a Golden Retriever is the hero of the film, while Amalu, a Cocker Spaniel , is the heroine. An indigenous breed canine named Karidas and Bruno, a Rottweiler, play the other major characters. Devan says, “Those were their names we chose for them when they were pups and we are using the same in the film too.”The team is planning to start the shoot next month. “The story is not region specific, so we are going for neutral locations,” says Devan. Ask him who would be dubbing for the canines in the movie and he says, “We can’t reveal that now.”Due to Covid-19 restrictions, the director says that he team will have a small schedule first with minimal crew and indoors. “We will have to go slow as this is a different kind of movie involving dogs. Also, we will plan the next schedule only after observing how the first schedule turns out,” he says.",entertainment,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-77219176,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-71566/77219176.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/malayalam/movies/news/valatty-a-golden-retriever-and-cocker-spaniel-play-the-leads-in-this-puppy-love-story/articleshow/77219124.cms
3,['29/07/2020'],Film exhibitors worried about burden of SOPs to reopen movie halls,"Movie halls across the country have been shut for over four months, and even though two phases of lockdown relaxations were implemented, there was no word on cinema exhibition. The buzz now, though, is that movie theatres will be on the list of businesses that can reopen as part of Unlock 3. According to those in the know, the state government is awaiting clearance from the Centre to announce the opening of theatres from August 1, subject to stringent measures on occupancy, sanitisation, social distancing and show timings. Speaking to us, President of the Karnataka Film Exhibitors Association President, KV Chandrashekhara says, “We have incurred losses to the tune of `150 crore in the four months that theatres have been closed. Movie halls being included in the next unlock phase is good news for us. But the future is far from rosy, considering that 25% is the maximum allowed occupancy when we do reopen. It remains to be seen if we will we able to even get to those numbers, as people are still wary of venturing to public places and contracting the coronavirus . A large chunk of our audience are college-going youngsters, who now have online classes and will not be out and about. Family audiences may also stay away, considering that children below 10 and the elderly should not step out. Even if the Centre allows theatres to reopen on August 1, we will have to wait for guidelines from the state government before throwing our doors open to audiences.”President of Mysore Theatres Owners Association, MR Rajaram, says, “If we reopen with 25% occupancy, our operational costs will exceed the income and affect our business module. A month’s electric bill of a normal single-screen theatre can run up to `50,000 per month, which cannot be recovered with the 25% occupancy per show. Thermal screening of movie goers and regular sanitization of the hall and seats need to be carried out, costs of which have to be borne by exhibitors. In the best interest of the business, the government should look at allowing at least 50%, else theatre owners may just shut shop and convert the premises into something more commercially viable.”Another theatre owner, Subramanyam, adds, “There will be challenges when theatres are opened to the public. Show timings will have to be changed to factor in sanitisation of the hall and seats after every screening. If the 9 pm curfew continues, the last show will have to start around 5.30-6 pm. We will have to work out timings backward from there. These issues need to be sorted out before we reopen.”",entertainment,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-77225100,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-26495/77225100.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/kannada/movies/news/film-exhibitors-worried-about-burden-of-sops-to-reopen-movie-halls/articleshow/77225100.cms
4,['29/07/2020'],#MonsoonHacks: How to keep your wardrobe fresh and fragrant,"When was the last time you neatly organised your wardrobe or took a peek inside your shoe rack? If you haven’t so far, then it’s high time you did. It’s monsoon after all. Open the closet and check if your favourite denims smell damp and musty. Since most of us are working from homes and do not need to dress up often, chances are that our clothes and shoes have already become the breeding ground for pesky little mould spores. But worry not! Here are some interesting storage hacks that you must follow to keep your wardrobe clean and fresh during monsoon...Use old newspaper lining on the shelves. Paper controls the humidity inside a closed space.Place a bag of salt in your wardrobe. It absorbs moisture. You can also put some sticks of chalk to keep your clothes dry.Take a muslin bag. Fill some camphor and put it in your closet. Camphor not only absorbs moisture, but makes your cupboard smell good too.Put some dried neem leaves in one corner of your wardrobe. This age-old trick keeps all kinds of microbes at bay and your clothes remain crisp and fresh.Insert a few naphthalene balls between your clothes. Naphthalene wards off insects and termites. It also thwarts the growth of microbes.Mould is a fungus that grows due to rising humidity in the air and lack of ventilation. Minimise moisture by making sure your wardrobe isn’t tightly fitted against the wall. Leave some space in between. If you’re keeping clothes that you don’t plan to wear in the near future, vacuum seal them to prevent moisture getting in. It’s important to de-clutter your wardrobe once in a while. Clothes stacked in your wardrobe for a long time can develop mould. Make sure your clothes are always dry. If possible, hang them in the sun before storing.Monsoon is the time when you really need to worry about your footwear and bags. Be it leather, cloth or suede, your shoes and bags should be moisture-free. Clean them with wax polish or duster brush and wrap them in thin bags made of cloth. You can order them online.Put silica gel packets inside your shoes and bags before wrapping them. It absorbs moisture and bad odour.Plastic bags can trap moisture and spoil the leather. So, wrap your bags in muslin.Try to keep camphor, naphthalene, salt in the cabinet where you store shoes.Use a hair dryer to dry your shoes and bags once in a while.",life-style,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-77226192,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-179218/77226192.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//life-style/home-garden/monsoonhacks-how-to-keep-your-wardrobe-fresh-and-fragrant/articleshow/77226166.cms

Online events are here to stay

As events continue to take the online route in the midst of the pandemic, literary events like poetry festivals too are joining the bandwagon. In fact, poetry festivals are making the most of the online medium and in the process, reaching out to a wider audience and participants.Case in point, is the annual Bengaluru Poetry Festival (BPF) that’s going online this year. The festival sees several literary names, celebs and performers in attendance and will be held in August. “Initially, even we thought that we wouldn’t organise the festival this year, because the charm of BPF lies in the intimate gatherings, where discussions, debates and performances are held with poets and poetry lovers from across the world. However, Shinie Anthony , who is the festival director, said that we had to do this and keep the spirit alive,” explains Subodh Shankar , a member of the organising team.Similarly, the Glasshouse Festival – Poetry from Around the World, which was held online recently, was also a first for the organising team. “Though we have conducted several virtual events earlier, this was the first time we organised the festival online. It was a mix of poetry and music performances,” says Raji Narayan, president of Art Mantaram Trust , a non-profit organisation that was behind the festival.Organisers also point out that online festivals are allowing them to reach out to more artistes and a larger audience. “This year, we have poets such as Gregory Kan, Avner Pariat, Roland Jurczok, Venus Jones, among others from India as well. If we had to reach out to the same names for a physical event, that wouldn’t be possible due to logistical issues. Also, people from around the world can watch them perform now,” says Subodh, adding, “Unlike most events, which are live streamed these days, we will have recorded events, readings and performances, that will be up on the festival’s website. People will be able to watch the videos anytime they want.”Raji adds that in addition to reaching out to a bigger audience, virtual festivals also fire the creativity of the organisers. “It pushes us to do our best and ensure that the audiences have a seamless experience. We had poets like Sonia Sanchez , Satchidanandan K , Jennifer Foerster and Norduran Duman, to name a few. As organisers we are on our toes and prepared for any situation, even while working from home,” she shares, adding that audiences have gotten comfortable with the idea of ‘entertainment from home’. “We have become so comfortable with entertainment from home, that for the next few months, this is how things will be even if venues were to open for the public,” she feels.",bengaluru,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-77224823,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1031094,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/poetry-festivals-go-online-with-better-reach-more-artistes/articleshow/77224823.cms

However, things are different in the post-COVID-19 scenario, as we found out when we visited the shooting spot of Sembaruthi. The usually buzzing set was a lot quieter. The cast and crew walked in with masks, sanitised themselves, got their temperature checked and then walked into the set.Dinesh, who’s producing the serial, says, “In view of the current restrictions, we are trying our best to work with limited resources and bring alive the story for our viewers in the safest way possible.” Ask him if the plot has been tweaked to bring in the COVID-19 angle, and he says, “We are not making any direct references to the pandemic. While the storyline may show some of our present realities (such as washing hands frequently, using hand sanitisers, etc.), we still want the show to be viewed as a positive escape from the current difficult circumstances.”We are very conscious while working and ensure we maintain distance while talking and doing our scenes. We wear our mask even after doing our makeup. Irrespective of the situation, we all need to look presentable on screen, right? So, we do touch-up more often than before.

Having said that, like every coin has two sides, online education may also send a child down a whole different path.Exactly why, there are a few prerequisites to effective online education.Here are a few requisites for you to leverage the flexibility of online learning for your child or student:Bridge The Distance Between Goals And Accomplishments With DisciplineHow does one live up to their plans? Well, with discipline, of course. Discipline will help you leverage the flexibility of learning through virtual classrooms and ensure that you stick to your plans in the absence of an external monitor.Helping your kid live a disciplined life even through distance learning is going to go a long way.It is true that distance learning removes a lot of barriers which the traditional form of learning sets up. However, it is also true that e-learning would require an extra effort on your part. Do the necessary research, plan out a good part of your child’s day and make it a point that you monitor their learning.If they do not feel like studying alone, sit with them and take the class. Make notes together and please, oh, please, have fun while doing all of it. There is no reason to make the process cumbersome and heavy.One of the most common teaching FAQs out there is, “How to make the child practice?”Well, in our opinion, the best way is to lead by example. Show your child first-hand how practice helps with better retention of knowledge and with helping them consume and understand what they are studying.It could be as simple as making paper boats with them and showing them how you will not stop until you get a perfect one.Enabling your child to process the importance of practice will help them enjoy the flexibility of their online education while taking up responsibilities on their own!The Millenials and The Gen Z are not here with a boon to be technologically advanced. It is just a matter of a few hours of effective learning. Go on Youtube or pick up a book or use Google, but find out how to take online classes, how to operate your Intel powered Dell or HP or Lenovo or any other laptop and make sure you are already learned in the field of online learning well before your child starts taking those classes. Learning how to operate a computer may look like rocket science, but it is not! Never forget that.Now that your child is going to be living at his school or in other words, learning or getting an education at home, it is extremely important that you strike a balance between their educational and personal part of the day.Also, since they will be spending quite a lot of time on-screen, it is important for them to spend some time off-screen too. In other words, try and strike a balance in all aspects of their day for it will help them with the overall development of personality.E-learning is here to stay and the faster we accommodate it, the better. Make use of your extra time to help yourself, and your child develop a great and unbreakable bond of trust and love.Leverage the flexibility of online learning and don’t stop until your goal is achieved!All the best!--------------------------------------------------------------PC Paathshala is an industry initiative by Intel in India with The Times Of India and multiple PC ecosystem players, to enable students, teachers and parents to adapt to online learning.

‘Loose change’ he allegedly stole was in the form of two unreleased Rs 20 coins.An employee of the India Government Mint at Fort faces up to seven years in jail for allegedly stealing the equivalent of four vada pavs. Thebooked R R Chabukswar on Monday after two yet-to-be released Rs 20 coins were found in his locker the previous day. The police are investigating whether this was the first time he had stolen coins from the mint.Acting on a tip-off, Samsher Sajjuram, a Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) inspector posted at the mint, had Chabukswar’s locker opened on Sunday in front of two witnesses. Inside, he found two of the unreleased coins. The tip-off came from sub-inspector Niyaz Mohammad, who had heard from a source that Chabukswar had hidden some coins in his locker. Chabukswar was booked under Section 381 of the Indian Penal Code (theft by a clerk of property owned by his/her employer), which carries a maximum sentence of seven years, a police official said.The official said that while Chabukswar had managed to hide the two coins in his locker, he would have found it much harder to smuggle them out of the mint, as all employees are frisked by CISF guards when entering or leaving. He added, however, that Chabukswar probably stole the coins out of curiosity rather than a desire to make money. The police are yet to arrest him, and have sent him a notice asking him to cooperate with the investigation. An official said, “The police have not immediately arrested the accused due to the Covid-19 situation. The punishment for this crime is up to seven years in jail. We have sent him a notice asking him to co-operate with our probe.”The new Rs 20 coin is part of a series thathad unveiled in March 2019, which also included new Re 1, Rs 2, Rs 5 and Rs 10 coins. The Rs 2, Rs 5 and Rs 10 coins are already in circulation. The Rs 20 coin was expected in April but its introduction was delayed by the pandemic.According to the Finance Ministry’s notification, the Rs 20 coin - the highest-denomination coin minted in India to date - will be in the shape of a dodecagon, a 12-sided polygon. Like the Rs 10 coin from the series, it will be twotoned. The outer ring will be 65 per cent copper, 15 per cent zinc and 20 per nickel, while the inner disc will be 75 per cent copper, 20 per cent zinc and five per cent nickel. But unlike the circular Rs 10 coin, which has 100 serrations on its edge, the Rs 20 coin will not have any marks on its edge.Established in 1829, the Mumbai mint is one of four in India.

To ensure more doctors serve in Covid-19 hospitals, given the lack of senior doctors where vacancies abound, the State government has come up with a scheme for young doctors. In a policy decision for those who have completed their MBBS or MD/MS degrees and have to serve in, the health department has decided to help them redeem theirby serving ininstead. As many as 86% ofhave refused rural service in past five years. The scheme is meant to attract them to serve in rural and peripheral areas.The notification issued on Tuesday states that those serving in Covid-19 facilities will be able to redeem double the time of their rural service.A senior official told Mirror, “If a person with recent medical degree is yet to complete his/her rural service against the medical bond, they can join the service and redeem it. If someone has one year of service left, just six months of service in Covid-19 facility is enough to redeem the bond. Similarly, only three months are needed in Covid for someone with six months of rural service left.” Medical students get seven years after MBBS or equivalent degrees to complete rural service for which they have to furnish a bond at the time of admission. If the student goes for, the same is kept in abeyance for that period.“This is a great opportunity for the students to complete rural service in half the usual time . By serving in Covid-19 hospitals, they are also helping in the effort against the pandemic,” Dr VG Vanzara, director ofand additional secretary at Gujarat Health and Family Welfare Department said.But those opting for this scheme could be posted in any Covid-19 facility across the state, Dr Vanzara said.Students of self-financed medical colleges challenge State govt decision to furnish Rs 20-lakh bond in lieu of serving in rural ares at the end of bachelor’s degree.

and travel curbs to get back to business

(This story is part of a series in association with Facebook. Facebook has no editorial role in this story.)

Every day in April, the 800-odd Van Gujjar families in Haridwar’s Gaindikhata area would dump 5,000 litres of milk down the drain. The lockdown had been hard on most, harder still on the forest-dwelling community with no other means of livelihood.In April, one member of the Van Gujjar community tested positive for Covid-19. The entire settlement was sealed as a containment zone for about a month. They could not step out and sell milk, which goes bad quickly. While they waited it out, 98 people from Gaindikhata who had attended the Tablighi Jamaat in Delhi and elsewhere, were identified. The Covid stigma got worse. And while the containment zone was unsealed, customers shut their doors on the Van Gujjars “They said the milk may be infected. People took advantage of us. We even sold milk at Rs 15 a litre. In all this, some started asking if we are members of Tablighi Jamaat. We follow Sufi Islam. But it didn’t seem to matter,” said Muhammad Alam, a member of the community.The pastoralist tribe, which lives near the Rajaji Tiger Reserve, is entirely dependent on its buffalo herds for survival. So while they couldn’t change what they did to make a living, they could change where they did it. So in June, some of the younger people decided to start exploring markets further away.“Travelling was restricted — sometimes we’d face lathicharge when anyone heard we were from Gaindikhata. So we tried to let others know by word of mouth,” said Muhammad Gulam, who runs a wholesale milk business at Gaindikhata. “It took some effort and a lot of time, but we slowly started getting customers in places much further away — Rishikesh (about 40 km) and Roorkee (about 50 km).”“We are selling milk at the correct prices of Rs 50-60 a litre again. We have new customers, business is brisk. And this seems to have encouraged our earlier customers too, who are all getting around to buying milk from us again,” said Alam.The owner of one of the largest dairies in Rishikesh, Sardar Puran Kainth, said even he harboured some apprehensions initially. “Since the lockdown began, we had not been sure about where to procure our milk from. But things are back to normal now. We will keep up our business with the Van Gujjars,” he said.",india,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-77223115,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1009253,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/uttarakhands-van-gujjars-now-back-to-milking-their-fortune/articleshow/77223127.cms

MASK: THE

NEW FASHION ACCESSORY

COUPLED WITH A MASK!

With major fashion trends taking a back seat ever since the Coronavirus outbreak happened in the country, a very prominent emerging fashion trend is that of designer masks . City designers are now going all out to woo Lucknowites with some funky customised masks. Read on...For designer Prakhar Tandon , owner of a chikan shops in Bhoothnath, designing masks is all about survival now. “See, people are not going out anywhere, so we hardly have sales of clothes. Since we deal mostly in chikan work, we sat with our workers and looked for innovation in the field. We have designed exclusive different layered chikan masks on different fabrics which are selling like hotcakes not only in the city but also online. The trend is here to stay for very long, as I predict.”(BCCL)Madhu Bhatia, a retired teacher, started making masks to distribute to the Covid frontline warriors working nearing her house. But seeing how beautiful they were, her neighbours asked her to make some for them too. “Seeing how necessary a mask is these days. I thought of giving them a better look. I had cloth pieces lying at home and I started making embroidered ones, ones with tissue, Banarasi zari fabric, which people loved. And now I have so many orders, it sometimes becomes difficult to fulfil all of them,” says Bhatia. “Then the kids started complaining that I’ve given their mother such beautiful masks and why not them? So that prompted me to design masks for kids,"" says Madhu.Lalita Pandey, a bureaucrat, gets hundreds of likes on social media when she posts pictures of matching masks that she wears with her outfits. “Masks are now mandatory, so why not wear beautiful ones which you can show off apart from keeping yourself safe,” she says. “Women want to be seen as fashionable, they would obviously want to wear fashionable masks than wear something which is dull and suufocating,” adds Lalita.Eesha Punjabi has been designing customised masks (BCCL)Poonam Mehrotra, a designer in Indira Nagar, happened to make hand painted masks which proved to be a big hit with her customers. “It began with my experimenting with masks that I had stitched and painting Madhubani motifs on them. When my friends saw them they loved them and I was literally flooded with orders. So much so that I am now sending masks to people in the US and also all over India.” Poonam goes on to add, “Masks are now a necessity, and have become a fashion accessory. We designers now have to be innovative in designing this new fashion accessory.”With weddings taking place now, Eesha Punjabi, a designer and owner of a fashion studio in the city, has begun designing customised masks for the bride and the groom. “The demand for designer masks is really high. While earlier the baraatis used to be gifted stoles, now they are getting designer masks. Plus, the bride and groom too are getting customised masks made for themselves. Even youngsters now want masks with either their initials or their partner’s initials.”",lucknow,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-77225324,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1300406,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/from-monotone-to-designer-lucknowites-now-want-fancy-masks/articleshow/77225261.cms

20,['29/07/2020'],Ranvir Shorey: I'm cynical now. I've seen too much. Nothing really changes,"Amidst the anger and debate following Sushant Singh Rajput 's death, Ranvir Shorey has been one of the more vocal voices commenting on the functioning of the cine industry Nila Madhab Panda , an 'outsider' himself, who has directed Ranvir in ' Kadvi Hawa' and ' Halkaa', asks him what’s got him so upset and if he thinks anything's really going to change in the power dynamics of the industry. Excerpts from the chat:Ranvir: Right now, the debate going on is about mainstream Bollywood, it is not about the Indian or Hindi film industry . It is about that group within a group, the top of the pyramid of mainstream Bollywood. Every actor aspires to be at the top, what happens is that you hit a glass ceiling, or you enter the gatekeeper zone where approval of a select few people can give you access to the top, otherwise you keep working for smaller rewards.Taking Sushant's example, he had been doing very well on his own. He had blockbusters under his belt but, like even Anurag (Kashyap) mentioned in one of his interviews, he wanted validation from this group, this cabal. These people wield a lot of power in terms of distribution and exhibition of cinema and marketing budgets. Seeking validation from these people is what I think went wrong for him.Ranvir: No matter how good a film is made, when you are not going to get shows in the cinema halls, what are you going to do? Dekho agar kisi ke paas power ho toh accountability honi chahiye, agar accountability nahi hai toh grace honi chahiye. Inke paas dono nahi hai. Anybody who has power doesn't want to let go of it. And they end up abusing that power.Ranvir: After Sushant's death, I was also devastated, thinking what the hell happened! When the circumstances around his death started being discussed and the names of the people he was involved with started coming out, I was shocked. These were the same names, same people involved at the time when I went through all this in 2003-05, the same circumstances. The psychological pressures were created for him also.First, you isolate someone at work. And in our business what happens is if you isolate someone at work, their social life is also affected. Aapko bade banner ne liya toh aapke dus dost hain, aapko bade banner ne drop kiya toh suddenly you have only three friends left. I was reading that his girlfriend was being told by one mainstream director that you better let this guy go or else you will also suffer. Then she also left him. What is the guy left with then? You isolate him socially, professionally, and then one last thing that a young man in his thirties would want to hold on to, his girlfriend, you affect that also. He just didn't know what hit him.When these things came out and the names of the persons involved were the same that I had suffered at the hands of, with no accountability, that's when I started speaking. And I was upset that if Kangana is talking about this, why are people asking her to keep quiet? Why should she not speak?Ranvir: For the disparity in power for distribution and exhibition, the streaming platforms will be equalisers. Marketing and media will be equalised a little with social media. These things will bring a little relief, but it's not that the world order will change once theatres reopen. The same people will still be in power.Un logon ko fark nahi padta hai. People like you and me, those who don't enjoy that privilege, hum log kabhi aise bol sakte hain, ki kaisi bhi film bana dete hain, 100 crore toh ye banayegi hi kyunki shows toh mere paas hain. Main aisa performance de sakta hoon, ki arey yaar main kuch bhi kar deta hoon, public toh taali maregi. Toh incentive hi nahi hai better kaam karne ka. Isiliye inki filmein itni gandi banti hai. Doesn't matter how many crores they make, but they make s**t films.Ranvir: Woh joh hope hota hai na – ki mere ko bhi kabhi mainstream picture milegi, 100 crore ki picture banegi – woh toh inn logon ne pehle hi maar diya hai. So mere ko fark nahi padta. I have stopped wanting to please those people for a while now. Thankfully, there are talented filmmakers like you who have faith in me. There are people like Rajat, Abhishek Chaubey , these are people who care about cinema, who care about making good films. I am very happy doing this. Mere ko big reward chahiye hi nahi, main small reward mein khush hoon.But many don't want to burn the chance they might get later of being accepted by the cabal. And you can't judge them for it either.Ranvir: The hoo-ha on social media with hashtags is not a reflection of what is happening in the real world. Once theatres open up, we might see a small difference in the disparity, the desperation and the despair that exists – that will be because of the presence of streaming platforms as a safety valve. But I have a feeling that the theatre game is going to go back to the same. I am a cynical man now. I have seen too much. Nothing really changes.",entertainment,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-77224326,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-658770/77224326.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/hindi/bollywood/news/ranvir-shorey-im-cynical-now-ive-seen-too-much-nothing-really-changes/articleshow/77224081.cms

China had claimed “positive progress” in the talks. There has been vacation of friction zones and thinning in Galwan Valley . The spurs along Pangong lake and Depsang area remain contested.

As border troops have disengaged in most localities, the situation on the ground is de-escalating and the temperature is coming down,” Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin said in Beijing. There was no immediate reaction from MEA to the Chinese claim. An agency report from Beijing quoted government sources to say India had denied it.

The Chinese assertion came in response to a query from Global Times based on media reports and information received from “sources”, as the journalist claimed.

NEW DELHI: In a positive sign for the economy shrugging off a long period of lockdown and depressed growth due to the Covid-19 pandemic , the total freight loading on Monday was a little higher than the freight loaded a year ago.

The figures are good news for the national transporter, as passenger traffic remains low with people avoiding anything apart from essential travel and the need for business-related commuting also down. Railway board chairman V K Yadav told reporters that the total freight loading was 3.13 million tonnes (MT) on Monday as compared to 3.12 MTs on July 27, 2019.

Railways stare at 35k crore revenue loss from fares

Details available on Raildrishti , railway ministry portal on live data, show there was only 6.6% less loading of freight during this month as compared to July 2019. The improved freight movement indicates that supply chains are moving even though movement of foodgrains under the Centre’s welfare schemes may account for part of the traffic.

The impact of the pandemic will continue to be felt in terms of the railway’s revenues. The earning reported in the portal till Monday was Rs 7,668 crore, 12.2% less from freight earning in July 2019. The railways could be looking at a revenue loss of Rs 30,000 crore to Rs 35,000 crore from passenger segment against the projected earning of Rs 50,000 crore. The losses are expected given the impact due to Covid-19 but the renewed movement of freight holds out hope that the wheels of the economy are beginning to move again. Railway board chairman V K Yadav said the fact that freight loading has rebounded despite Covid is a good sign and railways is confident of increasing it by 50% during the current fiscal. “This year we are looking at just 10-15% revenue from the passenger segment. Whatever revenue we lose from the passenger segment we will have to make it up by freight loading,” he added.

The Centre said construction of Parliament House was started in 1921 and completed in 1937. It is almost 100 years old. “Over the years, parliamentary activities have increased manifold. Therefore, it... is not able to meet the current requirements in terms of space, amenities and technology,” it said.

It said the Parliament building was designed to house the Imperial Legislative Council and not as a bicameral legislature — Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha . “Two floors were added in 1956. Fire safety is a major concern as the building is not designed according to present fire norms,” the government said in response to petitions challenging the Central Vista project.

38,['29/07/2020'],Government panel opposes Kashmir 4G but LG ‘says he’s OK with it’,"Lieutenant governor G C Murmu (File photo)

NEW DELHI: The Centre faced an awkward situation in the Supreme Court on Tuesday as the high-powered committee (HPC) headed by the home secretary has rejected providing 4G internet services in Kashmir for the time being but media reports suggested that lieutenant governor G C Murmu favoured resumption of high-speed internet services.

With Jammu & Kashmir going to observe its first anniversary as a Union Territory on August 5, attorney general K K Venugopal and solicitor general Tushar Mehta wriggled out of the discomfiting situation by seeking a week’s time to present the correct picture before the SC.

A bench of Justices N V Ramana, R S Reddy and B R Gavai posted the matter for further hearing on August 5. The AG and the SG said the date (August 5) had some significance and requested that the hearing be held on some other day. The bench posted the matter for hearing on August 7.

Petitioner NGO ‘ Foundation for Media Professionals ’, through advocate Huzefa Ahmadi said though the HPC headed by the home secretary had declined making 4G internet services available in Kashmir for the time being, Murmu had told media organisations that the administration had no reservation if 4G services were provided in the UT. “Our only request is that the authorities should consider the issue magnanimously rather than on other considerations,” Ahmadi said.

The SC had ordered setting up of a HPC headed by the home secretary to periodically review the situation in the UT and determine whether high-speed internet services could be provided to people. The NGO had said that in the absence of internet services, students could not attend virtual classes during the pandemic when schools are closed and were lagging behind their peers in other states. It also said businessmen could not transact, doctors could not give online consultation to patients and people’s free speech was impeded because of lack of 4G services.

However, the Centre had said that faster internet services were being misused by elements inimical to peace who acted at the behest of a hostile neighbour to spread rumours and arouse passions of the public and disturb the atmosphere in the UT.

Mumbai: The NSE on Tuesday said investors can now purchase treasury bills ( T-bills ) and state government bonds through its platform. It already offers the option to invest in Gilts through its platform.

The move comes within a week of Sebi chairman Ajay Tyagi urging financial market participants to handhold those who have recently opened demat accounts to begin with investing in less-risky government securities before moving on to stocks.

“In line with equity trading, investors can now buy and sell T-bills and SDLs ( state development loans , or state government bonds) through NSE trading members. The dated government securities ( G-secs , also Gilts) are already offered in the capital market segment,” a release from the exchange said. “T-bills and SDLs are both part of the government securities group and have been widely accepted as a safer investment choice.”

Earlier in 2018, NSE had launched a platform for retail investors to bid in the government’s bond auctions through RBI’s ‘non-competitive bidding’ segment. NSE has now launched trading in G-secs, T-bills and state bonds to provide an alternate exit route to these investors who have subscribed through the primary market, the release said.

40,['29/07/2020'],Cos can’t fight new age war with culture fit for museum,"By Prabir Jha

As organisations resort to digital quick fixes to keep their wheels churning, they must not declare success too early. While there surely will be a shift towards newer forms of working, we should be careful, or we will not see the wood for the trees.

Doing cosmetic changes will recarpet the old ways but will not help you truly move to a new world. As I keep reminding clients, don’t try and solve paediatric problems with geriatric solutions, even if they look youthful in their packaging.

Here are some fundamental reviews and changes if we want to enable our organisations to truly move towards being future ready:

* Composition of boards & CXO suites: In many cases, companies are stuck with leaders who were good and relevant in the years gone past. That, by default, is not good enough for the new times. There must be greater plurality in perspectives, functional and generational. Most boards still stay a preserve of convenience and years of relationship. The effectiveness of the boards to guide with more contemporary issues cannot be left out for politeness. Likewise, companies would do well to critique the quality of their leadership teams. Is there enough power to push forward? Is too much of past loyalty risking the future? Are there blockers or uninspiring leaders?

* Review your organisation’s architecture: As I listen to clients these days, I realise that many are slow to acknowledge that their structures are not quite aligned to their problems of today. And if they do, they struggle with changing it because of personalities that sit in boxes of such a structure. The world is amoebic today. How fluid is your organisation’s design? How do formal structures reshape to fight new wars, very much as militaries mobilise? What key gaps need new structures? What structures of the past now stand dilapidated or irrelevant and only harm cost and agility?

* Review your talent equation: Many companies will need to tweak, and possibly redefine, the way they serve their clients. While structures may need an obvious refresh, the talent staffing could have a new demand. Would it be possible to up-skill talent in the system? Or hire? Would we look at disruptive talent catchments? Would we take sharper risks and bets than in the past? What attributes beyond skills would we need more of, such that our talent is better attuned to win? These are all strategic calls and it may lead to be a big talent shake-up in companies, if they are serious about their future.

* Re-assess your organisational culture : It is good to be proud of one’s past, but dangerous to be blind to the limits of one’s legacy. As business models and customer-servicing shift, what is the strategic choice of culture for you? What will a ‘digital’ culture really mean? I hear many companies struggle with a clear repudiation of aspects they were proud of thus far. They need help to know it is alright to get rid of a culture that has outlived its times. It never is easy to rewire a culture, but it is surely not prudent to fight a new-age war with a museum-worthy culture.

* Reinforce all your people systems afresh: A new world emerging from this huge crisis is a world of opportunity, if we dare to think afresh. It will in turn call for courage and reimagination of all HR systems and sub-systems, both to drive the change and then to reinforce them. Leadership essentials, talent definitions, structures & processes, rewards and recognition to sustain the culture shift — all need a re-look. It is not a cost but an investment. At least an insurance premium. Bold HR thinking will need to lead and sustain all these strategic shifts. A huge shift must be from thinking HR the function to HR the agenda.

We are at a huge turning point. The way we turn will be how history judges us. The question though remains if we shall continue with an incremental and symbolic change, or truly have the courage to bite the tougher bullet? Hopefully, we will have more celebratory stories than obituaries to remember.

41,['29/07/2020'],91 new Covid-19 cases surface in Vadodara,"The new cases were detected from 687 tests conducted in the city

Vadodara: With 91 new cases of Covid-19 being reported in the city and district since Monday evening, the total number of cases reported in the city since the beginning of the pandemic went up to 4,381. The Vadodara Municipal Corporation (VMC) confirmed three more deaths taking the total number of victims to 82 excluding those who died due to other health complications, but were Covid-19 positive.

The new cases were detected from 637 tests that were conducted in the city and district. In the city, the new cases were reported form Manjalpur, Vasna, Fatehpura, Fatehgunj, Chhani, Gorwa, Makarpura, Sangam, Tarsali, Waghodiya Road, Soma Talav, Harni Road, Akota, Ajwa Road, O P Road, Tandalja, Subhanpura, Gotri, Maneja and Karelibaug.

42,['29/07/2020'],"Vid nearing 13k, Covid peak @75k likely by mid-August","Nagpur: Even though Vidarbha has reported over 1,000 Covid cases, including 500 in the city alone, and increased number of casualties in the last two days in July, the region is nowhere near the peak of the outbreak. The reality is that we have only begun to see the surge, say experts.

Vidarbha’s total Covid-19 tally is nearing 13,000-mark with 555 cases reported in a single day on Monday. In view of the projected peak at 75,801 cases in Vidarbha, extreme caution and self-discipline is required now, say experts.

Based on the present situation, scientists have projected that Covid-19 outbreak would reach its peak by mid-August in many parts of the country. Data analysis of New Delhi, Mumbai, Pune, Nashik and the recent one in Akola also shows that Covid spread comes under control only after a certain peak.

The office of commissioner of health services, Mumbai, had in April projected the probable number of cases in a day and 10 days during peak of Covid-19. As per the projections, Vidarbha will have total 75,801 cases as the Covid-19 peak. (10 days preceding these numbers will be considered as the peak period). These include 18,902 cases from Nagpur district, of which 11,114 will be in city. At present, Nagpur district has less than 5,000 cases and Vidarbha is near 13,000, which suggests that the anticipated peak is still far away.

Interestingly, the same projection had stated that Akola Municipal Corporation will reach Covid-19 peak at 1,475 cases. Akola reached this number on July 20. Since then, the cases there are declining. On July 28, Akola Municipal Corporation area reported just three new cases and seven from the district.

A divisional health department senior official, who is member of National Task Force on Covid-19, said different areas in the country will reach peak at different times. After Delhi and Mumbai, now peak is being seen in Thane, Pune and Nashik. Vidarbha will witness the peak in mid-August, he added.

“It’s a crucial phase for Maharashtra, because after Mumbai, Covid-19 is shifting its epicentre to other parts of the state,” he said adding that lockdowns were used to build-up health care facilities. “Now, most tehsil headquarters have Covid Care Centres where asymptomatic patients can be treated. People are more aware about facts, and symptoms. With this, we can avoid deaths,” he added.

“More lockdown means more delay,” said veteran pulmonologist Dr Ashok Arbat, who has been studying international data of Covid-19 since the beginning of the outbreak.

“Government is well aware of this peak as it had projected the same in April itself. Due to lockdowns in April, May and June, this peak got delayed. With easing of the lockdown in July, we are moving towards the projected peak. Now we should move ahead with caution, but without fear,” he said.

Following hand hygiene, Covid distancing, wearing mask and avoiding unnecessary gatherings must be our mantra during this period, said Dr Arbat.

What National Task Force on Covid-19 says

Different parts of country will peak at different times

Delhi is one such state where flattening of the curve is happening

Mumbai, Ahmedabad and certain parts in the South are showing a decline

They seem to have reached a plateau and are showing a downward trend

However, there are other areas where cases are increasing

How local experience goes

Epidemiologically, reaching a peak means we begin to see a decline in cases

Mumbai recorded lowest cases in 100 days on July 28

Akola district’s recovery rate is 81%, only 10 cases on July 28

Malegaon’s recovery rate 87%, only one case on July 28

Pune is now witnessing biggest rise in cases followed by Thane

Takeaway message for Vidarbha

Health department has projected 75,801 cases in Vidarbha during peak

Presently, we have less than 13k cases, so our march toward Covid-19 peak has just started

Lockdowns may reduce this pace, but curve will flatten only post-peak

Localized Covid-19 facilities, responsible behaviour, lifestyle changes must

Managing asymptomatic patients at home will make sure beds are available for serious patients

The move indicates chairman N Chandrasekaran ’s preference for an external candidate to steer the unit, which is an important flagship within the Tata Group Chandrasekaran selected Bollore after almost a six-month search through recruitment firm Egon Zehnder. A French national, Bollore, 57, will succeed Ralf Speth , who has been JLR’s CEO for a decade. Tata Motors had earlier planned to extend Speth’s term by a year, but the idea was dropped.Speth will move on to the role of non-executive vice-chairman of JLR from September 10. The Tata Group has occasionally created the non-executive vice-chairman’s position in operating companies to acknowledge an executive’s contribution to the business and to seek his expertise guidance, while continuing to remain on the board till the retirement age of 70 years. In the past, the group had made R K Krishnakumar, S Ramadorai and B Muthuraman the vice-chairman of Indian Hotels, TCS and Tata Steel, after they served as the CEO of the respective units.Bollore has spent his entire career at French companies, starting at tyre maker Michelin and then at automotive component supplier Faurecia and later at Renault. He joined Renault in 2012, where he rose to become its CEO in January 2019 after predecessor Carlos Ghosn was taken into custody over alleged financial wrongdoings. Nine months later, Bollore was dismissed in a boardroom coup as Renault wanted to save its relationship with Japanese partner Nissan.At JLR, Bollore will have to turn the English carmaker’s performance around. The company reported a pre-tax loss of 400 million pounds in fiscal 2020. Demand for new passenger vehicles remains under pressure as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic.

JAISALMER: Corona positive cases have been reported yet again from Pokhran area of Jaisalmer. Three jawans from a battalion and three labourers working in a solar power project at Lavan have tested positive. The district administration sprung into action after the cases came to light.

In the last five days, six army jawans have tested positive. The state government has ordered the installation of a RT-PCR machine for testing in Jaisalmer.

On the other hand, to curb further spread of the virus in Jaisalmer, urban public representatives will dedicatedly participate in and will make people aware about the precautions to be taken to keep the virus away. This pledge was taken by the Jaisalmer municipal council councillors in an awareness seminar organised at DRDA hall. They said they will extend all possible help to the district administration at every level to make people aware about the virus and will make them take all possible precautions.

Municipal council chairman Harivallabh Kala, district collector Ashish Modi, SP Dr Ajay Singh, UIT secretary Anurag Bhargava, municipal council commissioner Fateh Singh Meena , CMHO Dr BK Barupal asked everybody to follow all precautions and that Jaisalmer city requires wide and intensive efforts. The officials called upon all the councillors to abide by the advisory and make people aware.

Modi underlined the important role of public representatives in the efforts to prevent Covid-19. Apart from supporting the administration, one should make people aware. He said councillors are directly in touch with the people due to which they are better equipped at making people follow the advisory.

Meanwhile, looking at the increasing number of corona infections and increasing the number of samples, the state government has ordered to set up an RT-PCR machine, which is expected to be installed in next 15 to 20 days at Jawahar Hospital. Till now, samples were being sent to Barmer for testing and the reports came in 48 to 72 hours.

It is to be mentioned that till now, there are 11 districts in the state where corona testing facility is not available. State government has decided to set up a machine at the earliest in Jaisalmer. In this regard, PMO Dr VK Verma said that the place has been identified for setting up the RT-PCR machine. The machine is expected to be installed in next 20 to 25 days. This would provide a big relief to the people of Jaisalmer.

On an average, more than 1,500 Covid positive cases are being recorded per day for the last 13 days in the state. Experts have also attributed the surge in Covid cases to gradual increase in testing.Though the statewide lockdown was imposed on July 16, several districts had gone for lockdown before that. Patna district, where lockdown was imposed on July 8, has also recorded a sharp rise in number of coronavirus cases, with over 5,000 people testing positive for the virus over the last 20 days.As per the data shared by the state health department, the state had 20,173 registered Covid cases on July 15, a day before the enforcement of lockdown. With an additional 23,418 Covid-19 cases during the lockdown period, the number has now jumped to 43,591. Altogether 100 people have died of Covid-19 during the lockdown period. On the other hand, 1,22,348 samples have been tested during this period.While average testing till July 15 was around 10,000 per day, nearly 4,000 additional tests per day are being conducted now. On Monday alone, 14,236 samples were tested across the state.As far as Patna is considered, it had 1,114 registered Covid-19 cases on July 7, a day before lockdown. On July 27, the number stood at 7,067.Patna divisional commissioner Sanjay Kumar Agarwal said Covid cases started rising in the district from the beginning of July. “Proper analysis of increasing trend and decision to impose lockdown on time has proved beneficial. Else, there would have been five-time increase in the number of Covid cases. The lockdown helped in identifying active cases. These people were earlier intermingling with others,” Agarwal said.He added, “We have also increased the number of Covid-19 tests. Around 5,000 samples are being tested per day in Patna alone. In fact, the percentage of increase in tests is higher than the percentage of surge in Covid cases. Since the last two-three days, the number of Covid cases in the district has gone down.”Secretary of Bihar chapter of Indian Medical Association Dr Sunil Kumar attributed “poor enforcement” of lockdown to rise in coronavirus cases. “Even now, many people can be spotted on roads without masks.

Writing to Rajnath on various issues related to border areas of Kinnaur and Lahaul-Spiti districts, Dattatreya requested him to get dependable and robust telecommunication network installed and operationalised in border villages of the state and to make adequate arrangements to track movement of drones from the Chinese side.

He said that air defence assets need to be positioned at appropriate locations to prevent violation of Indian air space.

Dattatreya said there was an urgent need of an airstrip in Spiti to ensure prompt deployment of forces. The airstrip would act as advanced landing grounds, he said. Helipads in forward areas should also be developed, he added.

The governor recommended presence of central intelligence agencies, Indian Army and increase in the strength of ITBP to bolster people’s morale and to tackle any unforeseen incident of intrusion by China. He also recommended basic Chinese and Tibetan language training for ITBP and state intelligence agencies.

The governor went on to suggest guerrilla warfare and defence training for people by the paramilitary forces. It was done prior to 2001, and the local people, who possess high morale, were also demanding it, he added.

Dattatreya requested Rajnath to look into the matter personally and issue necessary directions. He said that about 240 km of Indo-China border falls in two districts of Himachal Pradesh.

Banking sector plays an important role in contributing to India’s economic growth through financing infrastructure, agriculture, local manufacturing, including MSMEs. Financial inclusion can play a big role in financial empowerment through technology,” the Prime Minister’s Office said in a statement.Those invited for the interaction include Rajnish Kumar, chairman, State Bank of India, Aditya Puri, MD, HDFC Bank, Sandeep Bakhshi, MD, ICICI Bank , S S Mallikarjuna Rao, MD and CEO of Punjab National Bank, and Renu Sud Karnad, MD of HDFC, sources said.According to economists, one of the key issues facing businesses is the absence of credit growth despite easing by the RBI. “Unlike most major economies, quantitative easing in India has not led to credit-growth acceleration. With bank credit growth already at a six-decade low and a likely contraction of nominal GDP in FY21, credit too may shrink, impacting banks’ net interest income,” said Sujan Hazra, chief economist at Anand Rathi securities.Unless the liquidity injected by the RBI and credit-enhancing measures (guarantees) extended by the government lead to the acceleration of credit growth, these steps would not aid revival of growth, said Hazra in a note on credit growth.Bankers made a presentation on their suggestions on what was needed in a meeting with secretary - department of financial services, which was a dry run for their meeting on Wednesday with the Prime Minister. Officials have pointed out that despite the massive amount of liquidity, banks are not lending and are instead parking funds with the RBI.On their part, public sector banks have blamed the government’s witch hunt against bankers and pointed to instances where cases have been lodged against the entire board by CBI, prompting them to play safe. The government’s move to repeatedly comfort bankers has had little impact in improving their risk appetite.Even now, they are preferring to be cautious instead of stepping up lending, amid fears of a sharp spike in bad debt in the coming months.",business,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-77232233,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-781221,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/pm-to-meet-top-bankers-today-discuss-credit-flow/articleshow/77229048.cms

NASHIK: The Local Crime Branch (LCB) of the Nashik rural police arrested a 26-year-old man from Satpur in connection with a murder that took place in Sinnar on July 19.

The suspect — Sandeep Manohar Sonawane, a resident of Ashok Nagar — has been handed over to Sinnar police for further investigation.

According to police, an unidentified body was recovered from Mohadari Ghat in Sinnar. “Later, it was found that the body was of a 38-year-old Ashok Mahajan, a resident of ITI Colony in Shramik Nagar . Autopsy revealed that he was stoned to death,” a police officer said.

A murder case was registered by Sinnar police and on the instructions of SP Arti Singh, the investigation was handed over to the LCB.

Police inspector KK Patil, who led the investigation said, “During investigation we found out that the victim used to take up some specialised painting works in the industrial areas . On July 17, he had been to an industry in Sinnar. We also found that Sonawane had gone with Mahajan to collect some payment.”

He added, “Mahajan and Sonawane were friends for the past one-and-a-half years and the former had borrowed Rs 700 from the latter. On July 17, Mahajan asked Sonawane to accompany him to Sinnar for getting his payment. After collecting the money, Sonawane asked Mahajan to pay back the money he had taken from him.”

Sonawane was upset that Mahajan was not returning the money despite getting a payment of Rs 18,000. Hence, in a fit of rage, he picked up a stone and hit it on Mahajan’s head.

53,['29/07/2020'],Hear plea for regular bail if accused is arrested: HC,"Representative image

PATNA: The judicial officer in a subordinate court may be held responsible for contempt of court if the accused, after arrest, is asked to withdraw anticipatory bail petition pending before the high court before hearing his/her regular bail application.

The bench of Justice Rajeev Ranjan Prasad of the Patna high court gave this observation while hearing the anticipatory bail petition of one Rahul Kumar on July 17. Rahul was arrested in an attempt to murder case while his anticipatory bail petition filed on June 8 was pending for hearing. The order has now come into the public domain.

The HC also observed that if any person is in jail because of the pandemic, it is not only the violation of his constitutional and human rights , but also a matter of judicial indiscipline.

Petitioner Rahul had moved for a regular bail before a Chhapra court, which asked him to produce an order showing withdrawal of his anticipatory bail petition first. He then urged the high court to allow him withdraw his petition.

The high court observed that a coordinate bench on May 26, 2015 had ruled that upon arrest of an accused, all proceedings in relation to anticipatory bail becomes infructuous. That time, accused Mohammad Matin had prayed that the lower court was not ready to hear his regular bail petition on the ground that his anticipatory bail petition was pending before the high court.

The HC had disposed Matin’s anticipatory bail application with observation that it had yet not seen such an absurd prayer and that no magistrate could ever make such an observation.

When counsel Ansul, appearing for the petitioner, submitted that the earlier order was not being followed, Justice Prasad observed that if any of the judicial officers in a court below is not following the order and observation of the coordinate bench, he may be held responsible for committing contempt of court.

While allowing the withdrawal of petition, the high court directed its registry to send the order to all district and sessions judges for bringing it to the notice of all judicial officers.

The attempt to murder case was lodged with Chhapra Town police station in Saran district on October 3 last year by one Rampravesh Rai of Dahiyawan Dargah locality. He had accused several persons of injuring him for opposing tractor parking in front of his house entrance.

BAGAHA/ SITAMARHI/ KHAGARIA: Lakhs of people across 12 districts in north Bihar continue to face flood-related hardships with most rivers in the region continuing to swell amid heavy rain in their catchment areas.

In Sitamarhi, incessant rain in the catchment areas of rivers in the district and those flowing in from Nepal, led to a surge in the water level in Bagmati, Lalbakeya Jhim, Rato, Maraha, Marar, Manushamara, Lakhandei and Hardi. All rivers were flowing above the danger mark at several places in the district.

Deputy CM Sushil Kumar Modi issued a statement on Tuesday which stated that around 23 lakh people will get benefit of free ration for five months under the ‘Aatmnirbhar Bharat’ scheme despite the hassles due to floods. “We are ensuring that per person 25kg food grain and per family 5kg pulses are distributed despite the issues in distribution of ration food due to the floods,” he stated.

In West Champaran, barring Gandak and Masan, smaller hilly rivers such as Haraha, Bhapsa, Jhikeri, Kosil, Kapon and Sonaha were in spate on Tuesday due to heavy rain in their catchment areas in the past 24 hours. Gandak and Masan eroded their banks in Jharmahuyee village under Bagaha -1 block, Kuari, Nagahi and Muzahi Gandak diara areas.

“Flood water carrying silt has spread over fertile land, which has destroyed paddy and sugarcane cultivated area,” Tharu Welfare Federation West Champaran president Deepnarain Prasad said.

The Sitamarhi district administration has organised vigils and patrolling of the embankments. Altogether 119 panchayats in 13 blocks are affected due to flood. Sursand, Parihar, Choraut, Bokhara, Bajpatti,Runnisaidpur, Belsand, Dumra, Riga, Suppi, Bairgania,Sonbarsa and Bathanaha blocks are experiencing flood. Shelter homes are functional in several blocks. A few community kitchens are serving food to the flood ravaged villagers in Parihar, Sonbarsa and Runnisaidpur blocks.

Road communications have not been restored between Sitamarhi-Sursand, Sitamarhi-Parihar, Sitamarhi-Sheohar and Lagma-Bhasepur. In Khagaria, flood threat to fresh areas eases as major rivers Kosi and Bagmati showed receding trend on Tuesday. The situation, however, remained grim as the flood has been stagnant in the affected villages. Road communication in many parts of the district has been disrupted causing great hardships to the people of the region. The daily flood bulletin issued by the district administration on Tuesday stated that 92 villages spread over seven blocks have been affected by the flood waters. The flood-hit population in the district stands at 76,380, the bulletin stated, adding three community kitchens are being run feeding around 2,700 people while around 3,400 food packets apart from over 700 polyethylene sheets have been distributed so far.

Khagaria DM Alok Ranjan Ghosh said the administration was geared up to tackle floods. All BDOs and COs have been asked to provide adequate boats and relief materials to the marooned.

PATNA: The family of late actor Sushant Singh Rajput had approached CM Nitish Kumar to seek support in the inquiry into his suicide, following which an FIR was lodged in Patna on Saturday, JD(U) insiders claimed.

A senior JD(U) functionary, preferring anonymity, told TOI that Sushant’s family thought Mumbai police was not fair in handling the case. “A message was conveyed to the CM by Sushant’s family, which considered that Mumbai police was under pressure from the Bollywood bigwigs. The family members feel that 75 years’ old Sushant’s father cannot fight for justice in Mumbai and wanted Bihar government’s support as he has documentary proof that a female friend of his son withdrew large sum of money from his bank accounts,” he said and added: “It is not a coincidence that a Bihar Police team reached Mumbai to carry out investigation in the case within three days of lodging the FIR.”

JD(U) national secretary general K C Tyagi said the Bihar government and police were trying everything possible to get a thorough investigation conducted as per the FIR. “We all feel the loss of a rising star from Bihar,” he said.

LJP chief Chirag Paswan also talked to Maharashtra CM Uddhav Thackeray on Monday and demanded a CBI probe into the case. “The Maharashtra CM said all those whose names have come up in the investigation are being quizzed by Mumbai police. He said Mumbai police is conducting the inquiry with all seriousness and if thought necessary, he would order for a CBI inquiry. He said nobody will be spared, if found guilty,” Chirag said in his two tweets.

Chirag told reporters on Tuesday that Sushant’s suicide was a matter of concern for him. “There has been a delay and FIR should have been lodged much before. But now that an FIR has been lodged, I hope the Bihar and Mumbai police will work together to find out the truth,” he said.

PATNA: Policemen are facing a tough time in flood-affected north Bihar districts as several police stations have been inundated by floodwaters .

East Champaran SP Naveen Chandra Jha said Sugauli and Panchpakhri police stations had been vacated as after they were submerged by floodwaters. “Sugauli police station is functioning from a hotel in the area.

The revised rate with a 10% rise became effective retrospectively from April 2020.

Between January-March 2020, 1.9 million kgs of tea was exported to China, as against 2.6 million kgs in the year ago quarter.“We haven’t heard anything on this from Chinese buyers. It appears uncertain,” said C Shreedharan, chairman, Upasi Tea Committee, the apex body of planters of south India.“China wasn’t the biggest market, but an emerging one for the past three years,” he said. No tea planter from the Nilgiris exports directly to China, instead it is routed through a merchant exporter, who buys teas from various sources in auction and blends them for export.An exporter who exported nearly 7 million kgs of tea to China said, “Compared to last year, the tea export scenario, especially to China, looks marginally better and promising as of now. If issues like geopolitical and Covid-19 escalate then we cannot say anything”.He did not wish to be named. The biggest market for Indian tea is Iran.Overall exports from south India between January and May have dropped sharply by 40% YoY to 28.3 million kg or a loss of nearly Rs 211.6 crore worth exports.However, there is a small solace over the past couple of weeks as prices in south Indian tea auctions are rising. “Between June and July there is a 15% to 20% increase in prices. But that is hardly a relief as the production is also down,” he added.Though the prices were up, the weighted average prices of CTC at Rs 106.8 a kg now is down 8.8% (January-June YoY) while that of orthodox tea at Rs 122.4 a kg was down 10.9%.All tea average at Rs 99.5 a kg is down 9.4%A morbid combination of erratic weather and unremunerative prices has pushed the industry to its decadal lows.Simply put: tea industry in south India is tottering.For the current year, production is down 19% at 93.4 million kgs.“For the past 10 years there has been no production increase. Kerala which was a big producer is dropping 3% to 4% every year and now produces only 60 million kg or even less. In Tamil Nadu too, volumes are dwindling, either due to erratic weather or due to unremunerative prices,” said Shreedharan.Added to these list of factors is the Covid and ensuing lockdowns.“Big consumers including hotels and tea shops are shut,” he said, adding that the glut in consumption matches a production glut and hence there may not be a a run away increase in prices or a steep increase in imports.With inputs from Shantha Thiagarajan from the Nilgiris",business,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-47529300,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-110164,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/india-china-spat-dents-south-indian-tea-exports/articleshow/77228110.cms

Vidhan Parishad chairperson Ramesh Yadav ruled in favour of Dinesh Singh on the grounds that the evidence submitted against him was not maintainable and that the person who filed the petition Deepak Singh was not an authorised member of the Congress and was not present when the incidents referred to in the petition took place.

Dinesh Singh had won the MLC election on the Congress symbol in 2016, but in 2018 he rebelled against the party and joined BJP. He then contested the 2019 Lok Sabhaelections as a BJP candidate against Congress national president Sonia Gandhi from Rae Bareilly.

In a letter to Yadav on Tuesday, Deepak Singh challenged Yadav’s decision to not recognise him as an authorised Congress member. “You made me take oath as a Congress MLC on July 23, 2016. On September 7, 2016, you recognised me as the party whip. On May 14, 2018, you recognised me as leader of the Congress legislative party. It is very unfortunate, however, that in your decision taken on Monday, you didn’t acknowledge me as an authorised person of the Congress,” Deepak Singh said.

Among the evidence submitted against Dinesh Singh was a video of him joining BJP under Amit Shah, but that was rejected on the grounds that the video was not clear,Deepak Singh said. He added that a letter written by Dinesh Singh to the chairperson on April 23, 2018 to tell him that he had joined BJP along with proof that he contested the Lok Sabha elections on a BJP ticket were also submitted to Yadav. “All this evidence was submitted to you and even a person who has basic knowledge of the matter would not have given the decision that you gave on Monday,” Deepak Singh wrote in his letter to Yadav.

He further said that the decision would not stand in the court as the Supreme Court order on defections is very clear.

The stock of gross NPAs also shrunk from Rs 32,878 crore to Rs 32,703 crore. However, the ratio of gross NPAs rose marginally due to net advances shrinking.

Naresh Singh (55), who used to earn his livelihood by begging at Danapur railway station, became so desperate that he might have sold his kidney for survival had not a good Samaritan prevented him from doing so and helped him.Danapur railway station has been the shelter for Naresh for the past several years. He was pulling on somehow on the alms he got from passengers at the southern end of the station. However, his plight started when train movement stopped due to the lockdown.Naresh said he had been facing starvation-like situation for the past four months. “Selling kidney was the only option that came to my mind for survival in such a difficult time when the trains stopped coming to Danapur station amid lockdown. Who will give me two times food every day to keep my body and soul together?” he told this newspaper on Tuesday.But it was Adam Parwez of Neemtallah Road in Khagaul, who spotted Naresh and prevented him from taking the extreme step. His daughter-in-law Saulat Ameri has been feeding Naresh religiously every day since then.Despite much persuasion, Naresh did not reveal the identity of the person who had actually goaded him to sell his kidney to make money.

65,['29/07/2020'],NPCI confirms WhatsApp Pay’s data localisation,"BENGALURU: A filing by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) with the Supreme Court shows that the National Payments Corporation of India ( NPCI ) has told the banking regulator that Facebook-owned messaging application WhatsApp is now fully compliant with data-localisation norms.In a letter dated June 5, NPCI, which manages the Unified Payments Interface UPI ), told the regulator that it “confirms” WhatsApp has now satisfied data-localisation norms for payments service. This is the first time the umbrella payments body has confirmed WhatsApp Pay ’s compliance status formally. TOI has reviewed the filing.“NPCI has reviewed the ‘Post-Change Review Report III’ certified by the independent third-party CERT-In empanelled auditor of WhatsApp — Deloitte. We submit herewith that we derive comfort from the reports submitted by Deloitte with regards to WhatsApp’s full compliance in the remaining three points on data storage guidelines issued by our office and accordingly complies with all five points in lines with requirements advised through your (RBI) letter dated November 1, 2019,” part of the letter to the RBI said.As reported by TOI, Deloitte was appointed by WhatsApp to audit its compliance after NPCI had asked it to make certain changes referred to earlier.Interestingly, the RBI is yet to specify when it will give the much-awaited final nod for WhatsApp to launch payments beyond the current trial-stage, which is restricted to 1 million users for two years. It has 400 million monthly active users. RBI’s response — which is part of proceedings after think-tank CASC challenged WhatsApp’s data compliance status — added that the apex court, thus, should dismiss the petition.“It’s clear NPCI has said they (WhatsApp) have complied with changes they were asked to make. Government’s nod is critical too,” a person aware of the matter said. The source was indicating the conflict of the messaging platform, with 2 billion users globally, resisting government requests to disclose the source of messages to curb rumours and hate speech. This would mean end-to-end encryption would be broken, which WhatsApp has been against and says only people who are messaging each other can read the conversations.Emails sent to the RBI, NPCI and WhatsApp India did not elicit any response on the matter.Last week, WhatsApp India head Abhijit Bose said it can bring at least 200 million of its users to UPI, which is seeing steady growth in digital payments amid the pandemic . UPI is dominated by Google Pay, Walmart-backed PhonePe, Alibaba and SoftBank-backed Paytm along with Amazon Pay. Bose also outlined plans to start multiple pilots in areas like digital lending, micro-insurance and micro-pension in 18 months.In June, Brazil suspended WhatsApp’s payments service to “preserve competitive environment” just after a week of its launch. WhatsApp, then, had said it remains committed to India and is working with local banks and regulators to launch payments services here.",business,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-77233006,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-32281,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/npci-confirms-whatsapp-pays-data-localisation/articleshow/77228456.cms

Till July 27, Fort Kochi, Mattanchery and their neighbouring areas together had reported 52 contact cases. Meanwhile, on Monday, authorities started swab collection of people in the high risk category in Fort Kochi.

Auto drivers were also called for testing. However, many expressed their unwillingness to turn up at Fort Kochi government taluk hospital. Only less than 10 drivers turned up at the hospital on Monday.

Later, health authorities approached police to persuade the drivers as per orders from the control room. As a result, 60 more drivers turned up for testing on Tuesday.

“We received a list of 150 auto rickshaw drivers in the Fort Kochi area with the help of union leaders and police. But many were reluctant saying they do not go on passenger trips and were transporting only vegetables. Auto drivers should secure Covid-19 negative certificates to operate in areas which have become clusters. We will discuss this issue at the district level. Auto drivers from other parts of Ernakulam had cooperated with us completely. But we faced resistance in Fort Kochi. Many were under the false impression that they would get infected if they turned up for swab collection at the hospital. We can facilitate a mobile team for the same at a different place, if they are ready,” said a health official.

Symptom surveillance also started in division II of Fort Kochi and it will cover 2,000 houses. Five Asha workers have been entrusted with the task of collecting details of people with symptoms like fever and other Covid-19 symptoms. Of the 250 houses surveyed on Monday, four people displayed symptoms and they were shifted to the taluk hospital immediately.

“Our priority is to collect samples from auto drivers. We cannot let anyone go untested because they are unwilling to. We will conduct a camp at Thuruthu Kadavu and at Nallu Kadavu in the coming days. Fort Kochi and Mattancherry areas are different from other places because of its high density of population. We are preparing a separate plan to test people from high risk areas,” said the official.

Meanwhile, a health official in Fort Kochi taluk hospital said, “We don’t know the reason behind the reluctance among auto drivers. They may be feeling that if tested positive, they will have to undergo treatment or go on quarantine.” However, auto rickshaw drivers’ union district convenor M B Syamantha Bhadran said he was unaware of the issue.

In certain areas, where the pandemic threatens to spiral out of control, district collectors have been authorized to take decision on imposing lockdown using their conscience.

Currently, the state government is creating micro containment zones covering three-four houses in a neighborhood where one or more persons test positive. Initially, the containment zones were bigger in size covering more than 1km area around the affected place. However, giving boost to economic activities, the state government is now allowing micro containment zones. But in certain areas, the state government may impose lockdown where cases are being reported in clusters.

The health department has analysed the situation in the entire state to find out the districts which are currently worst-hit due to Covid. The indicator of the current situation is the presence of active cases. The more the active cases in an area, the more the chances of spread of the virus. Eyeing the current situation, the state government is focusing more to contain the spread of the virus in such areas. “Lockdown in certain areas may be imposed in areas where the cases have been increasing and necessary directions have been issued to the district collectors on it,” said Raghu Sharma, health minister.

Apart from health department officials and doctors, district collectors will play a key role in containing the virus. “If the local circumstances, in terms of the pattern of the spread of infection, warrant a tough measure, district administration have been authorized to take a call in this regard at the local level in consultation with the concerned stakeholders,” said Rohit Kumar Singh, additional chief secretary (home).

However, the health department is also taking measures in Jodhpur and Alwar, which are worst-affected districts of the state currently. Officials in the two districts have been directed to intensify contact tracing and random sampling. Capacity of testing has also been increased to 42,540 per day. So far, more than 14 lakh samples have been tested in the state.

CHANDIGARH: The Haryana assembly has decided to take the action taken report (ATR) from departments into the observations or decisions taken by various committees, especially while indicting officials.

Haryana speaker Gian Chand Gupta convened a meeting of all committee chairpersons on Wednesday to discuss future course of action. This, he said, has become urgent in view of the fact that many departments had failed to submit action taken reports.

“The committees are constituted to act as alternate redressal system, especially on issues raised in assembly or by MLAs. We have seen that the departments have not taken observations of committees seriously. As a result, even the time-bound action taken reports are not submitted. This will not happen now,’’ said Gupta.

In case of observations where officials were indicted or department heads were directed to act against errant officials , departments took it lightly on the assumption that proceedings of a committee become irrelevant with change of members after one year, Gupta pointed out.

There are 12 committees which monitor functioning of all departments in the government of Haryana. These committees have frequently recommended action against officials.

Last month, head of the committee on schedule castes and schedule tribes, Ishwar Singh called for records related to pending cases against schedule castes and scheduled tribes. As the officer either failed to provide complete information, he sought action against supervising officers concerned.

Spread across four bighas of land, Bhalala’s farmhouse can accommodate about 15 patients who will be taken care of by five caretakers with home-cooked food and breakfast.

Talking with TOI, Pravin Bhalala said, “After recovery, I was advised 14 days home isolation and I decided to stay at my farmhouse in Kamrej. While recuperating there, I suddenly thought about the poor people who don’t have home isolation facility and that’s when I decided to turn my house into a facility for recovered Covid-19 patients.”

Bhalala said that four survivors are enjoying their free stay at his farmhouse now. “I have three other farmhouses which I plan to turn into isolation centres for Covid-19 survivors,” he added.

Interestingly, Bhalala was the first in the city to turn his residential project with 200 ready flats at Velanja village in Olpad taluka into the Covid care centre in the month of April. After he was left with a bad after-taste from the hefty medical bill served by a private hospital, realtor Kadar Shaikh, 59, decided to convert his 30,000 sqft private office space at Adajan Patiya into a Covid care centre where he provides free treatment to Covid-19 patients.

Shaikh’s elder brother, Ghulam Shaikh, 63, had tested positive and was admitted to a private hospital for 10 days where he was asked to pay Rs 12 lakh as hospital charges for the treatment.

Shaikh thought about poor people who cannot afford the exorbitant charges of the private hospitals and decided to change things, his way.

Talking to TOI, Shaikh said: “With the help of Surat Municipal Corporation authorities, we were successful in setting up the 84-bed hospital, which includes 74 oxygen beds and 10 ICU beds with ventilators on the three floors of a commercial complex in Adajan Patiya. The hospital will be managed by SMC authorities. Patients from all the communities will be given free-of-cost treatment. We will ensure that all needy patients get timely treatment.”

“The hospital will run till the coronavirus pandemic continues to ravage the city. Later, I have plans to convert the office space into the full-fledged hospital for the benefit of city’s needy and poor patients” added Shaikh.

79,['29/07/2020'],Pune: Covid strain on key infrastructures starts to peak,"PUNE: Pune urban is set to get massive makeshift hospitals with ventilator beds soon, but it's the rural areas that are facing serious deficiencies in critical Covid-19 treatment Latest data show there are just nine vacant beds with ventilator support for the entire Pune rural region, which comprises 13 talukas. Patients from these parts now have no option but travel long distances to hospitals in the city where, unfortunately, there's still no guarantee they will find beds. Plans are on to increase the number of beds in these city hospitals but serious strain is starting to show on healthcare infrastructure in the nearby towns and villages. Pune district collector Naval Kishore Ram said while cases are on the rise in urban centres, the numbers have been relatively low in the rural areas. He said there are enough beds, but the virtual dashboard — supposed to display bed availability in real-time - is not being used much.“In the rural areas, residents are not referring to the the app or the dashboard as much as their counterparts in urban centres. Many in these towns and villages still believe in calling up hospitals. At the same time, the civil surgeon should alert authorities if there are shortages of beds,” he said.The collector said jumbo Covid Care Centres are being set up at Junnar and Manchar along with more ICU beds at some of the hospitals. The district administration has said that its aim is to ensure patients from the rural areas find treatment locally, instead of having to travel long distances to cities where hospitals are already overwhelmed.Officials from the administration said that beds, particularly with oxygen support, are being increased in number across Pune rural.Former bureaucrat Mahesh Zagade told TOI that hospitals in the rural areas should be well-equipped so that local patients and their families don’t have travel all the way to big cities.“The ramping of infrastructure is essential for rural areas,” he said.But authorities overseeing Covid-19 containment in the villages have been keeping up surveillance and treatment protocols despite the many challenges.One of the strategies that has been employed is the Pune zilla parishad’s (ZP) Integrated Disease Surveillance Programme which secures real-time information on the situation in villages across the district.The IDSP staffers make over 500 calls to affected villages to collect feedback on active/ critical patients and deaths, if any.The programme, which also tracks medicine supply, is key to deciding containment measures.",pune,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-77235545,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-332562,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/13-talukas-currently-have-just-nine-ventilator-units/articleshow/77229620.cms
80,['29/07/2020'],"JJ Act, CARA rules not for Hindu adoptive parents","Representative image

CHANDIGARH: The Punjab and Haryana high court has ruled that in case of direct adoption from biological parents by Hindu adoptive parents , even if they are of foreign nationality, there is no requirement to follow the procedure either under the Juvenile Justice Act, 2015, or the central adoption resource authority (CARA) adoption regulations.

The court has also made it clear that it would not be open to the passport officer going into the validity of an adoption at the time of the issuance of passport. Therefore, the passport officer cannot refuse the passport beyond the statutory provisions set out in Section 6 of the Passport Act.

The high court also said that valid adoption under Hindu Adoption and Maintenance Act (HAMA), 1956, of a minor child cannot be revoked until disproved.

The Act applies to all religions apart from Muslims, Christians, Parsis or Jews.

Justice Nirmaljit Kaur passed this judgment while allowing a petition moved by a minor girl, Jasmine Kaur seeking direction to the regional passport authority to issue her a passport by dispensing with the requirement of a no-objection certificate (NOC) from the CARA.

“It is not mandatory to invoke the JJ Act , 2015 in the facts of the present case where the adoption is a direct adoption by the parents to the known adoptive parents/relatives under HAMA… NOC from CARA is required only by foreign parents and not Indian parents,” said the court, while taking note of the detailed submissions of the amicus curiae, advocate Anil Malhotra, who specialises in such matters.

Therefore, the court directed the CARA to issue a no-objection certificate (NOC) to the adoptive parents of the petitioner for taking their child to UK within two weeks. The regional passport office has been directed to immediately issue passport to the petitioner within two weeks of the receipt of NOC from CARA.

Jasmine and her twin sister were born on November 15, 2017, in India to her natural parents Manohar Lal and Gian Kaur. Jasmine was adopted by her mother’s real sister, Balbir Kaur and her husband as per the Hindu Adoption and Maintenance Act (HAMA), 1956, in Thalla village of Punjab’s Jalandhar district on November 16, 2018. Balbir is an NRI, OCI card holder and citizen of the United Kingdom.

But when the petitioner, Jasmine applied for the passport along with all the relevant documents, she was refused the passport by the passport authority on the ground that NOC from CARA or photocopy from Recognized Indian Placement Agency (RIPA) was required.

81,['29/07/2020'],Wastepickers write to Centre over rights,"NEW DELHI: As the Union environment ministry is collecting feedback on the United Framework for Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) under Plastic Waste Management Rules , 2016 , a group of over 12,000 waste pickers, doorstep waste collectors and other recyclers from Delhi-NCR have asked for more inclusiveness for waste pickers along a well-defined role. The last date for collecting feedback is July 31.

Members of the group Safai Sena wrote to the ministry on Wednesday, saying that the EPR — that makes producers accountable for recycling the waste being generated — needs to be focused around waste pickers instead of pivoting around producer responsibility organisations (PROs).

The group has submitted that the role of wastepickers and waste collectors has not been defined in the document. “According to a Central Institute of Plastics Engineering & Technology report and Central Pollution Control Board, there are approximately 1,000-4,000 informal and unregistered plastic recycling and manufacturing units in India. The government has to ensure that these do not get shut down and instead are upgraded for more efficient plastic recycling,” the letter said.

“Our role should be clearly defined and waste pickers should become key stakeholders in this framework. This framework gives no importance or focus to our community, instead allowing for companies and producers to not work with us or bypass us,” said the submission.

Jaiprakash Choudhary, secretary, Safai Sena, Delhi-NCR said that waste workers, who have worked their entire lives in recycling plastic in the country, need to be recognised, since they will be pivotal to how plastic is managed. “If not for waste pickers, plastic would have been dumped in landfills, polluting the city’s water, air and soil. The framework is giving unnecessary importance to producers and PROs,” he said.

82,['29/07/2020'],UP to decode virus with antibody testing,"Lucknow: After chasing numbers, the UP government has decided to work on the quality of testing. In wake of the new goal, the state is gearing up to undertake sero-surveillance exercise. Under this method, health teams would collect and test blood samples from a large sample to decode the virus and its nature vis-à-vis UP.

“The aim is to understand the extent of spread and also evaluate localized nature of the virus which is needed to study dynamics related to herd immunity,” said Alok Kumar, secretary to CM, overseeing testing activities. He said that the state was in the process of buying the required antibodies test kits.

Experts said that whenever any infection attacks a human, the body combats with a protective immune response. In this process, an antibody (a kind of protein) called immunoglobulin (IG) is produced. While there are different types of IGs in the body, scientists can look for IG-M and IG-G in case of Covid-19. The IGM antibodies tell about a current or recent infection and may reduce to undetectable levels soon after, IGG tell about past infection and can be reliably detected about 15 days after symptom onset.

Public health specialist and epidemiologist, Dr Vishwajeet Kumar said: “Knowing that the majority of cases are asymptomatic and therefore liable to be missed by RT-PCR testing, seroprevalence surveys could be a significant step in the ongoing battle against the pandemic. It can provide valuable insights into the extent of prior Covid infection.” “Seroprevalence also aids determining socio-demographic risk factors and co-morbid conditions needed to develop a more precise risk assessment scale for population-based Covid screening,” he explained.

Several virologists have noted that antibody tests help to identify the spread in the community. The antibodies tests have been criticised for not detecting the T-cells that directly target and kill the infected cells. Produced in the thymus gland T-cells are part of the human immune response against viral infections.

Activists have also sought a push for pending demands related to improving the rail connectivity and infrastructure through a memorandum submitted to the Centre by newly elected Rajya Sabha MP Bhagwat Karad.

Railway activist Anant Borkar on Tuesday said that the key railway demands of Aurangabad and Marathwada as a whole have been badly neglected for years. “There is no effective rail-connectivity between Aurangabad and Pune despite growing connect between these two cities. The existing rail route via Daund is too long. The new rail line would be a win-win situation for both passengers as well as the Indian Railways,” he said.

Veteran railway activist Omprakash Varma said the 88km Aurangabad-Chalisgaon stretch and the 22km Rotegaon-Kopargaon stretch were pending for years. “Both these routes will augment the the connectivity demands of the region and can further boost its industrial growth and religious tourism. The government must expedite these projects now,” he said.

“The box was later found abandoned near Kukadi river behind the temple,” said Deepali Khanna, deputy superintendent of police Pune Rural (Junnar division).

Ganesh Kavde, trustee of the Vighnahar Ganapati Devsthan Trust , said, “There was cash amounting to about Rs5,000 in the donation box. Due to the lockdown, the temple has been closed for the past four months. The gold-plated umbrella was made of about 1kg silver.”

Kavde said that the theft came to light around 5.30am on Tuesday when the temple priest noticed the broken door of the sanctum sanctorum and missing umbrella that covered the Ganesh idol. “After getting information from the priest, I immediately contacted the in-charge of the Otur police station Parashuram Kamble,” Kavde said. He added that it was later found that the suspects had also stolen one of two donation boxes.

The corporation staff didn’t have much understanding of the new act and imparting training will help them become aware of the proceedings as per the act, the secretary said.

At the same time, the secretary justified the closure of the poultry shop citing that the shopowner was engaged in activities like slaughtering of animals despite he was licenced only to sell meat. “We have sent a report to the LSG secretary. We have also referred the case to district industries centre, which is the nodal agency for implementing the KSME Facilitation Act. It is up to the agency to take action in this regard,” corporation secretary R Rahul said.

A no objection certificate from pollution control board is must for engaging in red activities like culling of animals, the report by the secretary stated. Officials with the corporation acted on the basis of the new clauses in Kerala Municipality Act amended as per the KSME Facilitation Act. Though the shopowner procured a self-certification, it was for selling meat and not for other activities, the report further stated.

Health wing officials of Kochi corporation, who conducted an inspection on July 24, had shut down a poultry shop at Thykoodam. Officials claimed that the firm didn’t have plants for treating solid waste as well as waste water while the owner showed a self-certification he procured through an online platform as per the KSME Facilitation Act. The corporation secretary heard the shopowner before preparing a report on the issue and sending it to the LSG secretary.

In his letter to the general manager of district industries centre, the corporation secretary has suggested programmes to create awareness on the act among public and also among corporation officials so that the staff will be aware of the fact that they are just facilitators and not implementing officers of licence rules as per the new act.

PUNE: Mayor Murlidhar Mohol has said that Pune Municipal Corporation limits still do not have enough Covid-19 beds despite a Rs 250-crore expenditure in the last four months on disease control.

Mohol, who himself recovered from infection earlier this month, demanded the state government release more funds for the PMC . The civic body, he said, has already spent nearly two times the annual budget reserved for its health department.

On an average, a massive sum of Rs 100 crore is reserved in the municipal budget for building health infrastructure in the city. But just in the last four months, the PMC has spent Rs 250 crore.

Besides that, officials said some Rs 300 crore would be needed for future needs. Mohol said the state government should release funds to meet these requirements.

The mayor said, “Even after spending so much on health infrastructure, finding a vacant hospital bed remains a major concern. The number of Covid-19 cases is likely to go up drastically by end of August. The state government should provide funds to PMC to ensure medical emergencies are handled well.”

Mohol raised his demands during a joint meeting between PMC and district administration officials that was chaired by Pune district guardian minister and deputy chief minister, Ajit Pawar.

Data from the civic administration shows that in the last four months, funds were mainly used to procure ventilators, oxygen beds, antigen test kits and PPE packages.

Along with health, other municipal departments such as the vehicles department, solid waste management and personnel too have spent a considerable amount of money because of the pandemic.

On an average, the annual health budget of the PMC is around Rs 400 crore. That includes Rs 300 in revenue expenditure and the rest, Rs 100 crore, is for capital projects.

“Funds are utilised for two types of works: revenue and capital,” a senior PMC official said.

The official added that capital funds are spent on works related to building facilities at PMC-run hospitals, out-patient departments (OPDs) and clinics. Revenue expenditure includes staff salaries, funds for civic welfare schemes like the urban poor health scheme and payment for contractual works.

While allowing a criminal writ petition by applicant Shriram Devare, a resident of Nagaon talka of Dhule district, the court directed the police to take a criminal action against the people accused from an educational organisation for their involvement in duping the government to the tune of Rs 50 lakh by drawing salary through alleged bogus and fabricated documents for over 12 years.

The 40-year-old petitioner was terminated from services as a drawing teacher by the president of an educational group in order to appoint his own daughter in place of the serving teacher, even though the claim of reinstatement of the petitioner was upheld by the school tribunal and endorsed up to the supreme court. The petitioner alleged that the school management had gone to the extent of preparing the forged and fraudulent approval to the services of new recruited individual.

It was brought to the notice of the court that the education officer working with the Dhule zilla parishad had called upon the school principal stating that approval to the services of the new teacher was bogus and on the strength of bogus approval, the salary was withdrawn from June 2006 to June 2018, causing loss to the government. The education officer later sought an explanation as to why criminal offence under section 420 of the Indian Penal Code should not be lodged against the school authorities.

The petitioner, on August 29, 2018, had lodged one complaint with police. Later, he registered one more complaint on December 12, 2019, pointing out commission of cognizable offences causing loss to the public exchequer to enormous extent.

Advocate S.S Deshmukh, appearing on behalf of the petitioner, argued before the court that it is mandatory on the part of police to register an FIR. Referring to the citation of the supreme court in famous Lalita Kumari versus government of Uttar Pradesh case, Deshmukh sought directions against the police officials for registration of crime on the basis of complaints lodged by the petitioner.

KANPUR: A 25-year-old ‘dharam-kanta’ employee, kidnapped for ransom in Bhognipur police area of Kanpur Dehat on July 15, was found murdered on Tuesday. The police arrested one Subodh Sachan, a close friend of the victim in this connection on Tuesday.

Later, accused Subodh, with whom a police team had gone to recover evidences in Bilhapur village, was injured when he tried to escape on Tuesday night and was shot at by the police. The criminal, who sustained bullet wound in his leg, was admitted to hospital in police custody.

The body of the deceased, Brijesh Pal, was recovered from a dry well in Kanha Kheda area of the district. A native of Chaura village, the victim was allegedly kidnapped while he had gone to perform duty at a ‘dharam-kanta’ located at Kanpur-Jhansi highway on July 15 night.

As per Brijesh’s family members, when Brijesh did not return home on July 16 morning, they went to the ‘dharam-kanta’ to inquire about his whereabouts, but he was found to be missing under mysterious circumstances. They had queried his co-workers but they had feigned ignorance. They thereafter tried to contact Brijesh on his mobile phone, but the call was answered by someone else who sought Rs 20 lakh as ransom from them within five days for his safe release. An audio clip related to the kidnapping of Brijesh had also gone viral on social media on Saturday, wherein the kidnapper could be heard calling the man’s family members and telling them to arrange a ransom of Rs 20 lakh ‘in five days’ otherwise Brijesh would be killed.

The kin thereafter informed the Bhognipur police and apprised them about the same. They also told police that the person who had received their call stated that he would call them again after five days. Police said that 11 teams were formed and subsequently investigation was launched following registration of an FIR on July 17. The body was recovered following sustained interrogation of Brijesh’s friend Subodh Sachan from a dry well in Kanha Kheda village under Devrahat police station area of the district on Tuesday evening. “On interrogation, Subodh disclosed that he had killed Brijesh soon after kidnapping him. On the information provided by the kidnapper, the man’s body was recovered,” SP Kanpur Dehat Anurag Vatsa told TOI.

According to the police, the body had been dumped in the well around 13 days ago. After the recovery of the body, Brijesh’s kin were asked to identify it. They confirmed that the body was of Brijesh.

Subodh hatched the plan to kidnap Brijesh to clear his debt of Rs 5 lakh that he had taken against the purchase of two trucks. According to the plan, he offered Brijesh a soft drink laced with sedatives at the ‘dharam-kanta’. “When he was knocked out of senses, Subodh kidnapped him and later strangled him to death in his car. When Brijesh’s family members made a call on his phone, the kidnapper (Subodh) demanded a ransom of Rs 20 lakh, but his call details and suspicious conduct landed him in police custody,” the SP said. The accused Subodh has been arrested under Section 364 of IPC and is being interrogated. Police were in the process of slapping murder charge against him.

This is the fourth incident of kidnapping in the state in the recent times and the third incident wherein the kidnappers have killed the abducted person. Earlier, a 28-year-old lab technician, Sanjeet Yadav, was kidnapped and killed. The police had also got the family to pay the ransom but failed to retrieve the money. Also, in this case, the police till date have failed to recover the victim’s body. Similarly, a 14-year-old boy was kidnapped for ransom in the Pipraich area of Gorakhpur district. He was killed by the abductors who demanded Rs 1 crore ransom from his family. Another case of kidnapping took place in Gonda where the eight-year-old son of a ‘gutka’ baron was kidnapped last week. The police were, however, able to recover the boy and arrest the accused.

93,['29/07/2020'],Ayurshield clinics a hit as people look for preventive solutions,"Kochi: Fear of contracting Covid-19 has made a lot of people look for disease prevention remedies, especially something that boosts one’s immune system. Knowing their need, private ayurveda practitioners and hospitals in the state have been setting up ayurshield immunity clinics , which are now turning out to be the most-sought after place for boosting immunity.

Doctors say there is a positive approach to general health as people are beginning to look at the need to stay healthy. “The approach that ‘we will deal with illness when it happens’ has changed to ‘what can I do to stay in good health’?” said Dr Sadath Dinakar, state secretary, ayurveda medical association of India (AMAI).

He said AMAI, which has been reviewing the calls and visits of patients, has found that there is a unusual panic among people when they show minor symptoms of cold and cough. “It is good that they are alert. Most calls are not for treatment. We get more calls not from our regular patients but new people,” he added.

AMAI doctors found that around 80% of the calls were about disturbed daily habits. “Most people sleep late and wake up late. Eventually, the breakfast, lunch and dinner get late. There is no walking in the morning etc., Taking these factors into account, doctors suggest solutions like home exercises, yoga, light and timely dinner and regular sleep time,” he said.

“There are a lot of people who complain of anxiety attacks. I have had cases where patients were rushed to hospital suspecting cardiac condition but it turned out to be severe gastric and indigestion due to lack of sleep, exercise and tension,” said Dr Devidas V, a senior ayurveda physician.

People call and ask for ingredients available at home which could be used to boost immunity.

Several hospitals are also using the occasion to come out with products based on the guidelines issued by Ayush ministry. “We get calls from the Gulf seeking preventive medicines. There have been calls from patients who have recovered from Covid-19 and want to ensure immunity against a second attack,” said Dr Madhu, Aryavaidyshala Kottakkal.

With both the Centre and state actively promoting ayurveda medicines through the ayur raksha programme, a lot of metabolism boosters are being introduced in the market after Ayush clearance.

Around 180 members of ayurveda hospitals management association (AHMA) have set up ayurshield immunity clinics which are functioning twice a week to reach out to patients. “Based on doctor availability, the dates are fixed and informed to public,” said Dr C S Krishnakumar, secretary, AHMA-Kerala.

Varachha police detained an embroidery unit owner, Akash Kushwaha , 21 , a resident of A K Road , who along with an accomplice , Ramji Bhatiya , 32 , a resident of Godadara , stole two textile embroidery machines worth Rs 5 lakh from an embroidery unit that was closed due to lockdown.

Kushwaha had planned the theft, while Bhatiya helped him arrange the crane to steal the two multi-head embroidery machines approximately 27x9 feet long and weighing more than two tonnes each from an industrial society in Varachha on Monday.

Earlier, police had booked an offence against some unidentified persons on charges of trespass, house break-in, and theft on basis of a complaint lodged by Shailesh Hirani, a resident of Katargam. In his complaint, Hirani claimed that two embroidery machines were stolen from the unit of his brother in-law, Janak Vekariya.

Vekariya had purchased the two second-hand machines worth Rs 5 lakh a few months ago and had started the unit in January. However, soon the lockdown happened and Vekariya was forced to close the unit. He then went to his native village in Amreli.

Meanwhile, he received a call on Monday from a neighbouring unit owner asking if he shifted had the machines. Vekariya was surprised and immediately asked Hirani to check.

Hirani rushed to the spot and found that the two machines were missing from the unit. The thieves broke through the wall to steal the machines! During investigation locals informed police that the burglars had come with a truck, a crane and some labourers to bring down the machines from the building.

Police later identified the crane and its owner. However, he informed the police that he was told by the accused that it was his unit and he wanted to shift the machines to another location.

“The accused shifted the stolen machines to his embroidery unit in Patel Nagar, which has remained closed after he sold off the machines a few months ago,” said a police officer.

During the past few days, accused Kushwaha often paid visits to a friend in a neighbouring unit and had noticed the closed unit. He did a recce and also verified that nobody visits the unit often and planned the theft.

The duo will be tested for Covid-19 and if found negative, they will be arrested. Police have also recovered the two stolen machines from the accused.

For this, optimum utilization of testing capacity of both public and private laboratories and use of antigen tests would play a vital role. Contact tracing and assessing oxygen saturation at field-level of high-risk individuals would help prioritize the testing and hospitalization,” Jotkar said.Giridhar Babu, senior epidemiologist, Lifecourse Epidemiology Unit, Indian Institute of Public Health, said by increasing testing, the denominator of test positivity increases, which eventually brings down the total positivity rate. “It also helps in identifying people requiring specialised medical care, thereby, reducing the overall mortality,” he said.A bureaucrat, who did not wish to be named, questioned the basis on which epidemiologists were quoting the high positivity rate. He, however, conceded that community transmission was happening in certain pockets, which made it all the more important to ramp up testing.Another expert who did not want to be named added that a high positivity rate means limited testing capacity — meaning only those most likely to be Covid-19 positive are getting screened and a large number of milder cases remaining undetected.",pune,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-77231759,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-42881,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/epidemiologists-call-for-further-testing-boost-to-check-spread/articleshow/77229636.cms

The court was hearing a public interest litigation filed by P Ponkumar, president of the Thamizhaga Kattida Thozhilalar Mathiya Sangam based at Madurai. The petitioner sought the state government to provide Covid-19 financial aid to all registered unorganised sector workers including construction workers irrespective of the renewal of membership.

During the previous hearing, the court had sought a response from the secretary of the welfare board with regard to queries: Number of registered workers on their roll, number of workers who have renewed their membership, number of members who have not renewed their membership and number of construction workers who have renewed their membership through online mode.

The additional advocate general K Chellapandian submitted that as per the counter affidavit of secretary of the welfare board, there are a total of 18,20,674 people registered under the board. He submitted that 12,13,882 people have renewed their membership and 6,06,792 have not. Members who have not renewed their membership could also renew by sending the application to the assistant commissioner of labour of the concerned district or through e-mail.

Senior counsel P Wilson appearing for the petitioner submitted though the GO passed by the government says that Covid-19 financial aid and dry rations would be given to the registered workers, the counter affidavit says that those who have not renewed their membership would not be eligible to avail the benefit.

He submitted that members who have not renewed their membership could be allowed to renew and Covid-19 aid could be extended to them. He further submitted that Rs 3,000 crore which lies in the deposit of the board could be used for this purpose.

Taking cognizance of the submissions, a division bench of justice M Sathyanarayanan and justice P Rajamanickam observed that the secretary of the welfare board has not responded to the query on number of construction workers who have renewed their membership through online mode. Hence, they directed the state government to file an additional affidavit responding to this query.

It said the university must postpone the direct recruitment of 54 regular faculty members as it would invite further expenses.

“There isn’t any revenue coming to the university, but spending is continuing,” said associations ecretary S Muruganandam. “The university has exhausted its general fund and now the corpus fund is used to disburse salary to staff. The corpus fund has come down to less than Rs 100 crore from over Rs 200 crore two years ago. It may last only till end of the year,” he added.

There was huge spending towards NAAC preparation in 2018 though the university secured A+ grade in April last year, said a finance department source. A purchase committee needs to be constituted to purchase material at competitive cost for developmental works. Instead, the university has been doing direct procurement without following procedures. “We have now sought constitution of a committee to inspect the spending for developmental work,” said the association. “The block of grant of Rs 5 crore from the state government in March has returned. Given the financial burden to the state government because of Covid-19, the funds are unlikely to come any time soon,” said Muruganandam.

However, BDU registrar G Gopinath told TOI that the university is in comfortable zone in terms of its finances though it is not as good as it was a few years ago. The university runs 10 constituent colleges and there is huge spending towards their 700-odd staff. However, the state government will reimburse the money spent on four colleges that it took over last year. “We get periodic block grants from the state government and Rashtriya Uchchatar Shiksha Abhiyan (RUSA). We are also looking for other avenues. Presently, there are no classes and we have no idea as to how long it will go on,” he added.

On Monday, during a meeting, Sindhu instructed officials across the district to distribute handbills at the panchayat level to educate people on rules to be followed by individuals while selling and transporting cattle. She also pointed out that the animal husbandry department, district veterinary doctor and officials above them can give permission to transport cattle. She also instructed officials to act stringently against illegal transportation of animals ahead of Bakrid. She warned that those who take the law into their hands by attacking cattle transporters will be dealt with an iron hand.

On the social media threat, Sindhu said that she has not lodged any complaint, but that the police are following up on what is available in the public domain.

Laxmi Ganesh, DCP (crime and traffic), Mangaluru city police, confirmed about an independent investigation taking place regarding the threat received by the deputy commissioner. “The DC has not approached us to file a complaint, however, we are investigating the issue, and the miscreant will be booked soon,” he said.

The Karnataka unit of Social Democratic Party of India (SDPI) has condemned the incident. The SDPI alleged that there was a nexus between the Sangh Parivar and police, which was resulting in attacks on cattle transporters in the district.

108,['29/07/2020'],"SCR land recorded as pvt property, 4 booked","Aurangabad: Aurangabad city police have booked a man and senior officials of the land record office on the charges of cheating and criminal conspiracy, after the suspect officials allegedly transferred 10 acres of railway-owned prime land, worth nearly Rs100 crore, in the name of a private person. The alleged cheating and forgery was committed sometime between 2012 and 2019.

City Chowk police inspector Sambhaji Pawar citing the official records, said the land originally belonged to the Nizam railways before it was taken over by Indian Railways. In the 1970s, after the formation of South Central Railways, the land was transferred to its name and it remained so till 2012.

Pawar said, “The preliminary probe has revealed there is a larger conspiracy in illegally transferring central government-owned prime land and getting it registered in the name of a private person.”

The officer said though there have been several incidents of fraudulently transferring private and administration-owned class II lands, but this is a rare instance of a central government land allegedly getting targeted by the builders’ lobby.

The matter came to the notice of railway authorities in 2018, following which the incident was taken on record. This eventually led to the private person coming forward with documents claiming to be the owner of the land. When the records with the land record office were checked, it was found that the official registers were forged.

SCR's senior sectional engineer Harishkumar Tamarkar, in his complaint said that sometime between August 2012 and January 2019, the land, situated in CTS number 20295, was registered in the name of a private person by the then officials of the land record office. Due to the alleged forgery, a PR card of new CTS number 20295/A/1 was made.

110,['29/07/2020'],‘Punjab govt should act on PSERC order on fixed charges’,"LUDHIANA: Resentment among businessmen against Punjab State Power Corporation Limited (PSPCL) and Punjab State Electricity Regulatory Commission (PSERC) is brewing due to the recent order by the PSERC, asking to pay fixed charges to the PSPCL on industrial meters for March 23 till May 23, which were earlier waived by the state government on account of lockdown.

The PSPCL had filed an appeal with the PSERC against waiving he fixed charges and the latter in its order on July 17 had ruled in favour of the PSPCL and said that businessmen should pay these in six instalments from September 2020. According to businessmen, it’s been almost two weeks that the PSERC gave this order but the state government had still not taken any notice of this.

According to Jaswinder Thukral , president of Janta Nagar Small Scale Manufacturers Association , “It’s very unfortunate that the PSERC has taken anti-industry stand once again and moreover, turned down the decision of the state government, which was taken by chief minister. If the PSERC thinks that the PSPCL is in losses and must be supported, then it should also not forget that the PSPCL is itself responsible for its plight due to its wrong policies and it’s illogical to punish innocent businessmen and extort fixed charges from them even for a period which we didn’t even open our factories. The state government must take notice of this blunder being done by the PSERC and immediately order commission to cancel it’s order.”

Vinod Thapar, chairman of Knitwear Club, said, “Slapping of fixed charges on industrialists for two months is very unfortunate and it will put huge load on us. Already the industry is in a spot due to rising losses and how will we be able to arrange money for paying these fixed charges. What is even worse is that the state government is silent even after the PSERC overturned its decision. But businessmen will not sit silent and we will protest if this decision is not taken back.”

According to Harish Kairpal, finance secretary of Knitwear Club, “Fixed charges for two months were waived by the state government on account of losses incurred during lockdown by us, but unfortunately the PSERC has ruled out this decision. We have been asked to pay these in six month instalments which is pointless as we are already under huge financial burden due to rising losses and fall in sales. We urge the state government to take notice of this immediately and ask the PSERC to take back its decision.”

PANAJI: A day after an action-packed one-day assembly session , the ruling and opposition have gotten into a war of words. Condemning the behaviour of the opposition in the House on Monday, BJP claimed that they had unanimously agreed to the single-day session in view of Covid. The opposition rubbished the claim on Tuesday and demanded that the government produce the minutes of the business advisory committee meeting as proof.

Former Panaji MLA Sidharth Kuncalienkar told reporters, “After the question hour, the opposition created an unruly scene. It was ‘goondagardi’ and they distrusted the functioning of the temple of democracy. BJP condemns this act.” Kuncalienkar said an effort was being made by Fatorda MLA Vijai Sardesai and the opposition to mislead the House. “Such things should not happen in the assembly,” he said.

Kuncalienkar added that after one MLA was found positive, speaker Rajesh Patnekar had called an all-party meeting on July 3.

“At the meeting, everyone was of the unanimous opinion that there should be a one-day session because there are a lot of senior members in the House. Leader of opposition Digambar Kamat who himself was chief minister for five years gave a statement that we have unanimously decided to have a one-day session,” Kuncalienkar said.

He also said that the opposition did not give a proper adjournment notice which was rejected by the speaker.

Reacting to BJP, the opposition lashed out and sought the minutes of the meeting. “Will @BJP4Goa produce Minutes of All Party Meeting with signatures of Opposition MLA’s substantiating their claim that Opposition had unanimously agreed for one day session of Goa Legislative Assembly? Our acceptance was CONDITIONAL as clearly mentioned in my Dissent Letter to BAC,” Kamat tweeted.

Kamat said the blatant lies of BJP alleging that the opposition had unanimously accepted the one-day session are out of frustration and failure of the government in handling the Covid pandemic and its inefficiency in reviving the economy of Goa.

“Spokesmen of @BJP4Goa are like Goebbels. Repeating a lie won’t make it the truth, not at least in #Goa ! Opposition agreed on passing vote on account never budget! But if the ministers of @GovtofGoa are capable of answering our questions let’s have a virtual assembly in exile! Ok?” Sardesai tweeted.

113,['29/07/2020'],‘Pathila curry can boost immunity’,"Kochi: The month Karkkadakam, according to ayurveda practitioners, plays a vital role in boosting one’s immunity. Since people are staying at home and not exposed to any kind of infections, improvements in the diet can help boost immunity. Ayurveda stresses on the importance of detoxifying the body’s impurities during this season.

However, with no panchakarma or wellness treatments in hospitals, doctors say one of the main ways to remove impurities in the body even while staying healthy is through having ‘karkkadaka kanji’.

“If people can’t make or get the karkkadaka kanji, they can make pathila curry by adding 10 different types of leafy vegetables in their diet,” said Dr Sharmad Khan, former secretary, Kerala state government ayurveda medical officers association.

The entire panchakarma process is not about just getting medicated oil massages, different kizhi treatments and steam bath. This loosens the impurities and fats from the body. But it has to be purged out through different processes which includes cleansing the stomach.

The concept in ayurveda is that summer drains you. “This will make you vulnerable to all kinds of fevers during monsoon. So you cleanse your body and eat nutritional food to boost immunity,” he said. “Try to drink dried ginger black coffee,” he added.

KANYAKUMARI: Former Nagercoil MLA Nanjil A Murugesan , 53, who was expelled from the AIADMK’s primary membership on Monday, has been booked under various sections of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (Pocso) Act on charges of raping a 15-year-old girl for more than two years. Four others – the girl’s mother who pushed the girl into flesh trade for her gains – and three other men who raped her have been arrested.

They were booked under Sections 3(a) (penetrative sexual assault with sexual organ), 4 (punishment for penetrative sexual assault), 7 (sexual assault by touching vital organs but not penetrative), 8 (punishment for sexual assault), 11(3) (shows any object to a child in any form or media for pornographic purposes), 12 (punishment for sexual harassment) and 17 (punishment for abetment) of Pocso Act.

Five special teams have been formed under deputy superintendent of police for the district crime branch to nab the former MLA who is on the run. Four people, Paul, 66, and Ashok Kumar, 43, of Idalakudi, and Karthik, 28, of Kottar besides the girl’s mother have been arrested so far, Kanyakumari district superintendent of police V Badrinarayanan told TOI.

Police sources said the girl who has been taken to a children’s home is highly traumatised and is being given counselling through the child welfare committee. A district child protection unit (DCPU) official said the incident came to light only a day ago after the girl who eloped with a 20-year-old man was rescued. A kidnapping case was booked against him since the girl is a minor. She was produced before a magistrate before whom she said in a statement that she was raped by the former MLA and a few others, based on which the court directed the matter to the Child Welfare Committee (CWC) on Monday. On the directions of the CWC, the district child protection officer lodged a complaint with the Nagercoil All Woman Police against Murugesan and others on Monday.

Murugesan who was Nagercoil MLA from 2011-16 was expelled from the AIADMK on Monday evening. In a joint statement, party coordinator and deputy chief minister O Panneerselvam and joint coordinator and chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswami said that Nanjil Murugesan has been removed from the basic membership of the party. The statement said the decision was taken due to his acts against the principles and objectives of the party and tarnishing its image.

(The victim's identity has not been revealed to protect her privacy as per Supreme Court directives on cases related to sexual assault)

BHOPAL: Educationists have raised objections to the state government’s decision to conduct open book exams for final year students. They said, the government should ensure that students do not use unfair means to write answers . Chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan on Monday had said final year students and fourth semester of post graduation can appear in open book examination — to protect students from Covid-19 and ensure social distancing.

Question papers will be made available to the students of final year graduation and to the students of fourth semester of post graduation on their login ID and prescribed website. In the open book system, the students will be able to write examinations at their home itself.

Examinees are required to submit their answer sheets at the collection centres — around thousands of which have been set up. Students will be able to submit their answer sheets either by post or by e-mail.

Former vice chancellor, Prof Tarique Zafar said, “How will government ensure that students don’t use unfair means while writing the answers”

He added that students should have asked to appear in exam. “Government can wait instead of taking such decisions in a hurry,” he added.

Former principal MLB college, Prof GD Singh reacted, “What is the point of an exam, if students are allowed to copy answers from a book. This is unfair to students who have studied all year around for a good score. There is a need for a well thought out strategy.”

Students too have raised concern over the open-book-exam patter. “Why should anyone study, when book is available. What is the sudden hurry, when everything is at a standstill due to the pandemic. Open book exam is not really an exam.”

The examination results of final year graduation and fourth semester post graduation will be declared by granting 50% weight to marks obtained in previous years and 50% to marks obtained in open book exams. As many as 5.71 lakh students will appear in examinations of final year graduation and fourth semester post graduation.

The health department had conducted tests on 16 dead people brought to various hospitals across the district, out of which three had tested positive.

Singh said, “The 65-year-old man from Kharar who was the 14th fatality due to Covid-19 was another comorbid patient. He breathed his last while undergoing treatment at PGI, Chandigarh. He was a patient of multiple comorbidities. Earlier, patients with high blood sugar levels, acute hypertension, asthmatic, cancer patients and kidney failure patients have been victims.” He said such patients are vulnerable to the infection as their immunity levels had dropped to a level where the body stops fighting the virus. Out of these 14 patient’s, nine are above the age of 65 years.

Singh said one of the patients was 82-year-old while two were relatively young — a 43-year-old anchor of a Punjabi TV news channel and a 42-year-old resident of Preet Colony, Zirakpur. The TV anchor suffered from kidney failure and underwent kidney transplant before testing positive. Singh said the recovery rate in Mohali is quite favourable at 62%.

123,['29/07/2020'],Jaipur: New norm to put pressure on infra in old colonies,"Residents believe that there is still no plan to upgrade infrastructure in these colonies

JAIPUR: Rules amended to allow construction of multi-storeys up to 18 metre height in residential areas have received mixed reactions from the residents and big developers.

As per the new amendments, the state government has approved construction of high-rises in colonies on 500 square metre plot. However, many believe there is still no plan for upgrading the infrastructure of these residential areas.

This would affect many existing colonies, including Bapu Nagar , Tilak Nagar , Bani Park, C-Scheme, Vaishali and others, which have bigger plots as providing extra height will allow more construction.

The move would create additional pressure on existing facilities in these colonies. Amit Tyagi, resident of Tilak Nagar, says “The court had earlier directed development authorities to identify special areas or zones for multi-storey buildings in the city which will be mentioned in the master plan and zonal development plan. This will block air and view of ground floor houses if a five-storeyed building is erected in neighbourhood,”

Town planners are of the opinion that with an expected population of 4.2 million by 2025, the state capital will be among one of the most populated cities of urban agglomerations in the country. Housing this large a population will require construction of about 10 lakh more homes within the city. Since large empty tracts of land are not available within the city, the cost-effective method to overcome housing shortage is allowing controlled development in old colonies.

An office-bearer of CREDAI, on the condition of anonymity said, permitting multi-stories in residential colonies without laying infrastructure adversely affects the rights of residents already settled. Moreover, it will also be a revenue loss for the state government which it earned from big developers.

“New multi-storey buildings should not be allowed in old residential colonies as basic amenities were developed keeping in view of number of plots and families residing such as parking. Construction affects the rights of residents. But, new guidelines have opened the way in many colonies.”

An official at UDH said vertical development is the need of hour to have compact cities saving precious agriculture land being converted for urban use due to horizontal expansion of city.

“The policy for encouraging multi-storey buildings in a regulated manner is required. Issues relating to fire-fighting preparedness of high-rises, including width of the road, area of plots, infrastructure facilities light and ventilation would be closely monitored by the development authority for safety of people,” he said.

124,['29/07/2020'],Work for lowering barrier at Giaspura railway crossing to begin soon,"LUDHIANA: After remaining suspended for more than three months following strict lockdown norms, Northern Railway will soon resume the much awaited work of converting the present barriers into a low height ones for checking the flow of traffic which usually tries to cross the tracks even after the barriers are down, risking their lives in the process.

At present, three railway tracks fall under the jurisdiction of Giaspura railway crossing. Two trains pass the barrier at high speed, due to which the linemen close the barriers for several minutes on a daily basis. But on the other hand impatient commuters try to cross the track when it is closed by moving under the barriers.

Although the present length of the railway barriers is appropriate to stop the road traffic but most of the time two-wheelers try to cross the railway tracks by passing through the space available under the barriers (which is three to four feet) without any fear of law and even become railway accident victims during late night hours when the visibility is low.

Moreover, a few days back Railway Protection Force (RPF) had held a meeting with the railway authorities to raise the issue of converting the present height of the barrier into a low height one to ensure the safety of passengers. The railway authorities have also agreed to their demand of quick installation of a low height barrier at the Giaspura railway crossing.

Giving information on this, company commander of RPF Anil Kumar said, “We are taking up the matter of installing low height barriers at Giaspura railway crossing to stop commuters from crossing the tracks in an unauthorised manner with their vehicles due to impatience, which sometimes lead to accident.”

He further said, “We have given recommendations to the higher authorities of the railways for beginning the work of installing low height barriers in quick time and make its height to 2 feet only so that passerby could not pass under the barrier.”

Tarun Kumar, Ludhiana railway station director, said “We are coordinating with the railway security forces and are looking at their suggestion to curb the menace of trespassing at Giaspura railway crossing by commuters and make them follow the railway norms in real sense. We will raise the same matter with higher authorities and wait for their future course of action.”

128,['29/07/2020'],Pune: Covid-19 poitive woman dies after futile 2-day search for ICU bed,"Representative image

PUNE: A 65-year-old Covid-19 positive woman died at a private hospital at Chakan, about 40km from here, on Monday after allegedly not getting a ventilator-supported ICU bed for two days. The death comes just six days after the state government issued a standard protocol regarding the management of Covid patients.

District collector Naval Kishore Ram told TOI, “We will investigate if there has been any deviation from the standard protocol. If a hospital does not have an ICU bed, it is their responsibility to refer the patient to the nearest hospital where such a bed is available.”

The woman, a resident of Kadachiwadi village, about 3km from Chakan, was first taken to a private hospital at Chakan on Saturday morning, her daughter said. “My mother was suffering from breathlessness. After checking her, the hospital told us to shift her to Yeshwantrao Chavan Memorial Hospital (YCMH) in Pimpri. We took a prescription and went with my mother to YCMH at 1.30pm, but they said they did not have a ventilator-supported bed,” she said.

The family then took the woman to private hospitals at Morwadi and Nigdi, but couldn’t get her admitted as they too did not have ventilator beds.

“One private hospital at Wakad demanded a deposit of Rs 50,000 to admit my mother and told us that daily expenses on treatment would be more than Rs 30,000. Since it was too expensive for us, we returned home with my mother,” the daughter said.

On Sunday, the family took the woman to the Rural Hospital (RH) Chakan.

Madhav Kankawale, head of the hospital, said, “The woman needed ventilator support as her oxygen saturation level was below 60. We checked with YCMH and Aundh Chest Hospital but no ventilator beds were available. We also checked with the dedicated Covid hospital centres at Chakan and Khed but they too did not have beds. We then told the family to approach a private hospital.”

The family finally took the woman to a private hospital at Chakan, but she passed away on Monday.

Ajay Joshi, block development officer of Khed tehsil, admitted that there were only three ventilator beds in the tehsil to treat critical Covid patients. “We need at least 15-20 such beds. We have appealed to private companies in the Chakan area to use their Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) funds to set up ventilator beds at our dedicated health centres in the tehsil,” he said.

YCMH dean Rajendra Wable said, “We admit critical patients from the Pune rural areas at our hospital. But we have only 33 ICU beds functioning at present. Making beds available has become difficult for us. We need ventilator beds at any given time to treat patients who are already admitted here. When patients show improvement in their oxygen saturation levels, we immediately shift them to the Covid care centre at Balewadi.”

Wable said, “In this woman’s case, we will be able to comment only after verifying our internal documents. We need at least one day to check our records.”

The woman’s daughter said, “My mother’s life could have been saved had she got a ventilator bed in time. Nobody should ever face a plight like ours. The government has done very little for public health infrastructure.”

LUDHIANA: Expressing anger for not being given permission to open gyms and local body building centres , members of several body building associations and gym owners gathered on a city road on Tuesday afternoon to stage a protest against the central government for not giving them permission to open their businesses.

They have been raising the issue that if the state government couldn’t fulfil their demand of allowing them to open their gyms and body building centres, then it would be impossible for all of them to manage their household expenses because these are the only sources of their income.

One of the members of a body building association Amarjot Singh said, “After the imposition of lockdown, gyms and body building centres were closed down by the home ministry but now the government has given relaxation to each and every sector, then why is the government not giving permission to gym owners for re-opening their business, which is totally unfair because a large number of youth are involved in this business for fulfilling their basic needs.”

“We are struggling to manage the daily expenses of our families as for the past few months we didn’t earn even a single penny for managing all kinds of household expenses,” he further said.

Another member of the same association Backy said,“After getting fed up with the none-cooperative behaviour of the government, all body builders took to the road for selling gym equipment and indulged in related activities in protest against the ruling government for not listening to our long pending demand. They have failed to take appropriate action for the welfare of body builders and gym owners.”

“We are appealing to the government bodies that they should reconsider their unlock rule and give exemption to gym owners for reopening their businesses after following social distancing and health safety norms,”' another member said.

GANDHINAGAR: The Gujarat government on Tuesday set an upper limit for what private hospitals across the state can charge for treating Covid-19 patients. This comes as the virus is spreading to smaller cities and towns and aims to prevent them from charging exorbitant fees for treatment.

The government clarified that the rates announced on Tuesday will not be applicable to private hospitals in Ahmedabad, Surat, Vadodara, Rajkot and Bhavnagar, where Covid treatment rates have already been fixed.

A government statement said a ceiling rate of Rs 5,700 can be charged for Covid patients in non-ICU wards. Those admitted to high dependency units (HDU) cannot be charged more than Rs 8,075 per day.

A ceiling of Rs 6,000 per day has been set for wards with ICU facilities and an upper limit of Rs 8,500 per day has been fixed for HDUs with ICU facilities.

Covid patients being treated in ICU with isolation facilities can be charged an upper limit of Rs 14,500 per day, while those in ICUs with isolation facilities and ventilators can be charged a maximum of Rs 19,000 per day.

UDHAGAMANDALAM: The Mudumalai Tiger Reserve (MTR) in the Nilgiris, home to about 103 tigers, has of late been witnessing a gradual decrease in vegetation in the core area right from Theppakadu range. If one is wondering whether it is a dying forest and the change in ecosystem working against the wildlife, the answer is no. According to forest officials, it is a natural process and wildlife play a major role in shaping the ecosystem of a forest.

Srinivas R Reddy, former field director of MTR, says, “It is not a dying forest. Elephants push trees down to eat the bark. They damage more vegetation than they eat. Given the state of affairs, MTR is actually gearing up for more carnivores, especially tigers. Lesser the tree density, more the grass land for carnivores’ prey base.”

He says change in forest ecosystem is natural. “Unless there is no human-induced activity or artificial shaping, forests are safe in the hands of wildlife.”

Theppekadu and Mudumalai range of forests in the MTR are dried up and regeneration is very poor. Planting tree saplings would not work in the reserve forests as animals would browse them. However, the damaged forest area would become grassland, which is an advantage for carnivores as that would become a good prey base for them, says Reddy.

However, the other side of MTR (towards Kerala) is very much green as that is a riverine area. The changing composition of forest is a dynamic process and would enhance the forest and the wildlife, he says.

K K Kaushal, field director, MTR, says, “It is - drying up of forest land in the MTR buffer zone - not a sudden change. Wild animals would migrate according to their requirements within the forest cover. More open area will help protect deer population.”

But the spread of lantana camara, an invasive species, in the MTR is a cause for concern as it is outgrowing the natural grass. Kaushal says, “Only manual weeding is advisable in the forest area. There is no technology to weed out the invasive species that is harming the biodiversity.”

“No approval has been granted under the Forest (Conservation) Act,1980, for two project proposals,” Sawant said in a written reply.

The chief minister said the Union environment ministry has granted Stage-I (in-principle) approval under the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980, for diversion of 97.8ha of forest land for the three transmission line project proposals submitted by Goa Tamnar Transmission Project Ltd. However, approval for one of the three projects involving an area of 48.3ha, of which 11.5ha comes under the national park and wildlife sanctuary, is awaited.

He also said that the forest department has received three proposals under the act for diversion of forest land involving area under the national park and wildlife sanctuary. The projects include doubling of the railway track from Castlerock to Margao and involve diversion of 138.4ha of forest area, out of which 128.3ha is in the wildlife sanctuary.

The government has received representations/objections regarding the railway track project through the sanctuary and national park, however, the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) was carried out before approving the doubling of railway track and national highway projects.

JAIPUR: The state and national consumer dispute redressal commission has upheld the compensation of Rs 10,000 awarded to a consumer by the district consumer forum , Jaipur, for charging extra for a paper bag with printed advertisement of a shoe company.

The district consumer forum had imposed a compensation of Rs 10,000 on Bata India Limited for charging Rs 2 for the company’s printed bag with shoes.The forum had ordered payment of compensation including 9% interest if the compensation is not paid in two months on complaint by Mahesh Pareek .

The forum said in its order that the company gave this bag to the complainant for its advertisement and in return it recovered the cost of the bag. Neither the bag had the price written on it, nor was any information in this regard pasted at the store.

The complainant had bought shoes from Bata store in Sodala on April 16, 2016, for Rs 399. The company added Rs 2 to the price and placed the shoes in a paper bag and gave it to the complainant. The complaint stated that the company name and logo were attached to the bag for the purpose of advertisement and the consumer being charged for the same is illegal. The company challenged the order in the state and national consumer dispute redressal forum but both of them upheld the order of the district forum.

GANDHINAGAR: The Gujarat government on Tuesday set an upper limit for what private hospitals across the state can charge for treating Covid-19 patients. This comes as the virus is spreading to smaller cities and towns and aims to prevent them from charging exorbitant fees for treatment.

The government clarified that the rates announced on Tuesday will not be applicable to private hospitals in Ahmedabad, Surat, Vadodara, Rajkot and Bhavnagar, where Covid treatment rates have already been fixed.

A government statement said a ceiling rate of Rs 5,700 can be charged for Covid patients in non-ICU wards. Those admitted to high dependency units (HDU) cannot be charged more than Rs 8,075 per day.

A ceiling of Rs 6,000 per day has been set for wards with ICU facilities and an upper limit of Rs 8,500 per day has been fixed for HDUs with ICU facilities.

Covid patients being treated in ICU with isolation facilities can be charged an upper limit of Rs 14,500 per day, while those in ICUs with isolation facilities and ventilators can be charged a maximum of Rs 19,000 per day.

The government statement added that these charges do not include the cost of tocilizumab and remdesivir injections and medicines for secondary bacterial infections.

146,['29/07/2020'],"ED searches GVK offices in Mumbai, Hyderabad and Pune in Rs 705 crore case","Searches were related to a Rs 705-crore case of Mumbai airport

MUMBAI: Enforcement Directorate (ED) on Tuesday searched five offices associated with GVK group in Mumbai (two), in Hyderabad (two) and in Pune as part of a probe into a Rs 705 crore money-laundering case related to development of Mumbai airport.

ED collected computer records and documents to examine financial transactions of companies associated with GVK group. GVK declined to comment on the searches.

ED registered a money-laundering case against GVK group, its chairman Venkata Krishna Reddy, Mumbai International Airport ( MIAL ) and its managing director Sanjay Reddy along with others for alleged irregularities in the airport’s development.

ED’s probe under PMLA (Prevention of Money Laundering Act) is based on an FIR registered by CBI on June 27 against 13 persons, including Venkata and his son Sanjay, and Airports Authority of India (AAI) officials. CBI had searched GVK’s premises in Mumbai and Hyderabad following registration of the FIR. MIAL allegedly indulged in fraudulent transactions to help GVK, causing a loss to AAI, a government entity managing the airport earlier.

ED is probing financial transactions of MIAL, GVK group companies and private companies roped in for the airport’s development. The central government agency will follow the money trail generated through allegedly fraudulent transactions.

MIAL is a joint venture formed in April 2006, in which GVK Airport Holdings holds 50.5%, AAI 26%, and the rest is with foreign entities. MIAL was given the airport’s operational management and maintenance. MIAL was to manage operations and share 38.7 % of earnings with AAI first, and keep the rest with the company for modernization of the airport. GVK, allegedly in connivance with AAI officials, committed fraud.

In one case, AAI gave a 200-acre land parcel near the airport to MIAL for development and revenue generation. But MIAL allegedly entered into a bogus contract in 2017 with Aishwaryagiri Construction, Kotia Enterprises, SBK Trade & Infrastructure, Subhash Infra, Aqua Tech Solutions, MV Omni Projects, Richa Industries, Nice Projects and Aditi Infrabuild for real estate development. MIAL allegedly transferred Rs 310 crore to these companies but the contracts were not executed.

In another case, the accused allegedly forged a board meeting resolution of MIAL to use Rs 395 crore surplus fund to create a fixed deposit in Bank of India’s Hyderabad branch. GVK allegedly raised loans against the FD for other group companies. The accused also allegedly allotted premium retail areas of the airport to companies owned by family members, relatives and close employees at low rates that caused a revenue loss to AAI.

The proposal was approved at a meeting in the House on Monday.The proposal stated that while the civic body was making several arrangements to fight Covid-19, it needed money to continue the efforts. It added that in case of an emergency, community halls and schools buildings might also be required to be converted into isolation or quarantine wards. “For all these activities, a lot of fund may be required but SDMC has limited resources. To strengthen the civic body’s finances, it is proposed to accept voluntary donations from the general public as a gift under the DMC Act,” the proposal said.Officials said that the donations would be accepted only through online payment, and for this, a separate bank account would be opened and details would be in public domain.Narendra Chawla, leader of the House in SMDC, said that the funds would only be used for preventive measures or treatment of Covid-19 cases. “Donors will receive a certificate of appreciation but no other benefit will be given.

As soon as the number of Covid patients is rising in the district, the number of deaths is also increasing and one LPG crematorium is not sufficient to meet the demand. So on Tuesday, mayor Balkar Sandhu and MC commissioner Pardeep Sabharwal visited a crematorium at Daresi, where one LPG-based crematorium was installed but it was never put to use and now even its electricity connection had been disconnected.

The mayor claimed that for cremation of Covid victims many precautions were required. Though at Dholewal cremation ground one LPG crematorium is functional, just a single system is not sufficient. He claimed that another LPG crematorium is also being planned at Dholewal cremation ground. Sandhu claimed that they also contacted the management committee and one of the committee members Sunil Kumar claimed that the electric crematorium had not been functioning for the past 18 years and it was not advisable to restore the electricity connection.

He said now they had decided to change this into an LPG crematorium and for that SE Rahul Gagneja has been deputed. He said Gagneja had been asked to visit other cremation grounds as well. The mayor claimed that there were LPG crematoriums in other cremation grounds like Neechi Mangli and Dehlon also and they would check the arrangements there as well.

This electric crematorium was installed by MLA Rakesh Pandey around 18 years back at Daresi cremation ground but it could not be used even once because people prefer traditional rituals at the death of their loved ones. Besides, the powercom had also snapped its electricity connection long back.

PANAJI: Unstarred questions about Mollem that were put up at the one-day monsoon assembly session on Monday by Rohan Khaunte and Ramkrishna Dhavalikar were of a very general nature, said the Save Mollem Goa Citizens ’ Group.

“It is so very disheartening to have our elected representatives…fail to bring it up in the assembly,” said Lorraine Fernandes.

The responses they got were that environmental impact assessments (EIA) reports were only submitted for two out of the three projects, and excluded the LILO transmission line, they wrote in a statement issued on Tuesday.

“The reply to Khaunte’s unstarred question states that the forest minister has received three proposals for three projects, when an independent analysis from lawyers a few days ago to the Central Empowered Committee of the Supreme Court shows five different proposals have been received for the three projects inside Mollem, besides at least four more forest diversion proposals outside,” the statement read.

The citizens’ group also pointed out that a Sterlite power project has asked for police protection for the 400 KV LILO transmission line and substation at Xeldem before this project was even approved and until its finalisation. They questioned why the office of the collector and district magistrate, South Goa provided protection as early as February 2019 when the project was passed only much later in April 2020.

“We need answers to our questions since all these unnecessary and environmentally-destructive projects were passed hurriedly. It’s a humble request not to destroy an international tourist destination like Goa under the guise of development and building of state economy,” said student Chrisene Oliveira.

LUDHIANA: The district administration and the health department’s poor arrangements at a quarantine centre raised the hackles of policemen admitted there. They took up the matter with their seniors and were shifted to home quarantine on Tuesday.

Of the 20 cops who had tested positive for novel coronavirus on Monday, some were isolated at the quarantine centre in Meritorious School , near Rose Garden.

The cops said they were denied basic facilities like bedsheets and pillows at the centre, which was plagued by not-up-to-scratch sanitation services. “Besides, the health department did not give us any medicines, whether immunity boosters or vitamins, for an entire day,” they added.

While speaking with the TOI on phone, a Covid-19 positive cop said, “After I tested positive, I wanted to stay at home and isolate myself in a separate room . But, I was taken to the Meritorious School isolation centre. There, I and five other positive patients were accommodated in one room. There was one washroom for all six and no worker to clean it. The centre lacked basic facilities. We could not sleep properly as there were no bedsheets or pillows.”

Another cop said, “I was admitted to the centre around 4pm. Besides tea and food, we were not given anything else. There was no warm drinking water or kadha, fruits and medicines. Why would anyone live at a centre that offers no provisions? No doubt, a suspected patient escaped from there on Monday.”

“After spending a night there, we approached our seniors and apprised them of the inadequate amenities at the centre. We were then shifted to home quarantine,” a cop added.

This is when the mangrove cover in the country has increased by 54sqkm during the period, says Kannan C S Warrier, senior principal scientist, Institute of Forest Genetics and Tree Breeding (IFGTB), which celebrated the International Day for the Conservation of the Mangrove Ecosystem recently.

Speaking at the event that was conducted on IFGTB campus, Warrier said the Forest Survey of India has assessed the mangrove cover across the 12 major mangrove habitats in the country. “While the cover has increased by 37sqkm in Gujarat, 16sqkm in Maharashtra and 8sqkm in Odisha, Tamil Nadu along with three other states saw a drop in the mangrove cover by 4sqkm.”

Referring to the importance of mangroves, he said they were effective carbon sinks. “Mangroves act as a form of natural coastal defence against storm surges, rising sea levels, tsunamis and soil erosion.”

IFGTB director C Kunhikannan said mangroves also provide a valuable nursery habitat for fish and crustaceans. Hence, it is essential to plant more mangrove species and increase their density, he said.

A preliminary report for the same will be prepared in a month, Union agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar said on Sunday. After preparation of the initial report, subsequent meetings will be held with the chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan for further course of action, he said.

A decision in this regard was taken in a virtual meeting with World Bank representative Adarsh Kumar, who said the it is keen to work in MP , an official statement said.

“More than 3 lakh hectares of rugged land is not cultivable and if this area is improved, then it will help in the integrated development of the ‘beehad’ area (ravines infested with dacoits) in the Gwalior-Chambal region,” the statement quoted Tomar as saying in the virtual meeting.

Tomar further said the project will not only help improve agricultural development and environment but will also create employment opportunities and lead to substantive development of the region.

Tomar said there is a lot of scope for development of the ‘beehad’ area in Gwalior-Chambal region. The Chambal Expressway will be built and will pass through this area, through which the overall development of the region would be possible. “It was decided that the substantive project would be prepared in collaboration and support from the World Bank to accomplish the work.

He also stated that there was no system in Ludhiana though the administration was claiming to have all facilities and beds.After receiving the reply, the chief medical officer Dr Rajesh Bagga has decided to form a committee to take further action.The victim’s son stated that his father was unwell, so they had gone to the DMCH to give samples for the test of Covid-19. Next day, his father started facing respiratory problem, so he was rushed to the hospital. He asked doctors to admit him, however, they refused as the test report was still awaited.He added that his father’s health was deteriorating due to which he kept requesting hospital staffers to at least admit him and give him oxygen. However, the authorities kept him there on a stretcher. His father kept saying that he was unable to breathe and only then he was given oxygen. Despite that he was facing breathlessness doctors were adamant on first getting the report.He further said that finally the report came by 4pm, which was positive. Thereafter, the hospital authorities refused to admit his father, saying that they don’t have a bed. They asked to take him to the civil hospital.

Then he hired a private ambulance, which took Rs 4,000 for merely 4km to take his father from the DMCH to civil hospital. But there he was declared dead.“I am making this video to make you all aware that there is no system in Ludhiana. They are claiming that they are providing beds, but that is not true. I would also suggest people to rather go to the civil hospital, there you will get the list of hospitals where beds are available. When the civil hospital refers you to some hospital, then other private hospitals will give you treatment,” he added.Dr Bagga said that the authority of the DMCH had replied to the notice that they had no bed to accommodate the patient.

MUMBAI: The city economic offences wing ( EOW ) has begun a probe into a case where 78 depositors were cheated of Rs 11 crore by promising them more than12% annual returns by a brokerage firm and its office-bearers.

An officer said Goregaon resident Rajesh Shah (45) lodged a complaint with Matunga police for breach of trust, cheating and criminal conspiracy under IPC.

Initially, they gave returns and gained trust,” said a source. In 2020, they stopped giving returns, so a police case was filed.

Some of those named in the FIR are partners and office-bearers Hasmukh Gogoari, Dilesh Vira, Ramanik Dedhia, Mukesh Chedda , Pankaj Chheda, Khushal Chheda, Hemant Chheda and Jayesh Dedhia. No arrest has been made so far.

169,['29/07/2020'],Uncertainty over fishing ops from August 1,"MANGALURU/ UDUPI: Uncertainty shrouds resumption of deep-sea fishing off Karnataka coast with the 47-day fishing holiday ending on July 31. To tide over the situation, fishermen representatives and stakeholders in DK will meet on Wednesday to decide the future course of action. Their Udupi counterparts have already decided on their strategy during a meeting on July 20.

Representatives of purse seine boat owners and other stakeholders will take a call on resuming fishing from August 1 at this meeting, Nitin Kumar, president, Mangaluru Trawl Boat Owners’ Association, said. Around 4,000 workers on 1,200 fishing boats are migrant labourers from Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Odisha, West Bengal and Jharkhand.

Noting that the fisheries department may extend the current fishing holiday due to Covid-19, Nitin said that it will be the duty of stakeholders to adhere to SOP to ensure Covid-free fishing operations. The meeting will explore the feasibility of postponing the operations by some more days.

Around 900 of the 1,200 boats are trawl boats with a crew complement of 8-10 members spending around 10 to 11 days in deep-sea fishing, he said. The 100-odd purse seiners with a crew complement of 25-30 fishermen are daily runners who return with their catch at the end of the day. The 200 other mechanized boats which have a crew complement of up to five fishermen are out at sea for a maximum of three days and fish in shallow waters, he explained.

The Malpe Meenugarara Sangha, parent organisation that oversees activities of 22 other organisations under it at Malpe harbour, has placed the onus on owners of all mechanised boats to ensure implementation of SOP. Sangha president Krishna Suvarna said they cannot and will not stop fishing boats venturing out for fishing from August 1 nor will it come to the aid of fishing boat owners if their crew test positive.

“Udupi DC G Jagadeesha has informally said that he will be forced to seal down the harbour if positive cases are reported at the harbour. In such a case, the boat owner will not be is a position to unload the catch and this will only compound the financial losses . This decision, taken at a meeting on July 20, has been communicated to all those concerned,” he added.

170,['29/07/2020'],Govt tightens noose on private schools,"AHMED ABAD: Further tightening its noose on self-financed schools, the government on Monday said that schools that do not have teachers qualified according to the Right To Education (RTE) norms, will face punitive action.

The government had set March 2019 as deadline for the schools to follow RTE norms like completion of PTC and BEd studies as eligibility criteria of teachers. Experts say the ongoing stand-off between the government and self-financed schools brought about the new twist in the government’s approach.

The district education officer ( DEO ), Ahmedabad has issued a circular in this regard to all schools.

The state government recently issued a directive to the schools to not collect fees for the time the schools have been shut since March 16 due to Covid-19 lockdown.

The government notification said that the Gujarat Self-Financed School Management Association had on June 26 clearly denied to give any relief to the students in their fees.

“Hence, through the notification, the government has decided in the larger public interest that the self-financed schools will not be allowed to collect any type of tuition fees for the period from when they were physically closed till when they were physically re-opened,” the notification stated.

Soon after this decision, the schools had last week shut down online classes and many began an online campaign to oppose the government’s decision.

In response, the government came up with a notification that it will provide free online classes for school students. While self-financed schools resumed the online classes from Monday, they continue to oppose the government’s decision and many of them have also challenged it in the Gujarat high court.

172,['29/07/2020'],"Resume drunk driving checks soon, social activists tell police","Coimbatore: Social activists are mounting pressure on police to resume drunk driving checks, which came to an abrupt stop following the Covid-19 outbreak.

Police had registered 3,491 drunk driving cases from January to March 15, before the checking was stopped as police were wary of going very close to motorists. Activists are now suggesting police to take motorists, who they suspect to be under the influence of alcohol, to government hospital for blood test.

The city police have more than 50 breath analysers to detect if a motorist is drunk or not and the alcohol level. To control the spread of Covid-19 among the police personnel, they were on March 16 instructed to stop the usage of breath analysers.

R Mutharasu, city deputy commissioner of police (traffic), says, “It is too risky to ask motorists to blow the device. If any motorist is infected with Covid-19, the cop who is handling the device and other cops in the team would be at the risk of contracting the virus. So, we have stopped drunk driving checks.”

In 2019, the city police had registered 16,451 drunk driving cases. This year’s case details, he said, have been sent to respective courts as we don’t collect fine from drunk motorists. Courts normally imposes a fine of Rs10,000 for drunk driving.

A police source said vehicle movement has increased in the city as the government has relaxed the lockdown. Pointing out that people have started driving under the influence of alcohol, activists said, that might lead to more fatal accidents in the city. “Police should take suspected cases to the government hospital and test them to know whether they are under the influence of alcohol.”

Sumit Sharan, city police commissioner, said they would start using breath analysers to catch drunk motorists once the Covid-19 spread is controlled.

Ara Arularasu, district superintendent of police, said the rural police have been booking at least four drunk driving cases a day. “Cops are taking motorists, who they think are in an inebriated condition, to nearby government hospitals for testing. If results show that the alcohol level is higher than permissible levels, we book them and forward the details to courts for further action.”

Currently, there are only 1,700 positive cases. Yet, the administration has failed to provide admission, treatment of positive patients and testing of their high-risk contacts for 4-5 days.

In a hush-hush fashion, the administration went on to implement home quarantine of high-risk contacts and home isolation of positive patients within a span of four days.

On July 21, a Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) fire station in-charge had tested positive for Covid-19. It took two days for the civic body to take swab samples and test the officer’s close contacts all of who are its employees. Of the total 100 staffers, 16 had tested positive on July 24.

It also took four days for the NMC to admit 14 of total 16 employees in Dedicated Covid Hospital (DCH) and Covid Care Centre (CCC). Two employees were admitted in GMCH and remaining 12 employees at VNIT and Pachpaoli CCCs on Monday evening.

Two employees, including in-charge of a fire station, were still at home till the time this report was filed. This is what the officer told TOI: “ “I am asymptomatic but cannot isolate myself at home as there are 10 family members residing with me. Despite my requests, I was not admitted to a hospital. My family members too were not tested. I went to a private laboratory to get tests of my family members done.”

Since July 23, TOI has been reporting about the delay in admission of positive patients by 1-2 days. As on Tuesday, the district had 1,706 active cases.

The office of commissioner of health services, Mumbai, in letters dated April 13 sent to all collectors and commissioners of municipal corporations in the state, had projected peak of Covid-19 in mid-May and asked to prepare facilities for testing, admission and treatment.

18,902 cases — 11,114 in city and 7,788 in rural — in 10 days was predicted in the district. The state government had approved funds to tackle the crisis too.

Works on a large scale were undertaken and the administration — Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC), collector office, IGGMCH, GMCH — had claimed facilities for 12,000 patients in a day in May. All of them mentioned that totally, 2,600 beds were available at GMCH, IGGMCH, two trust-run and central government-run hospitals each. Claims were also made that over 10,000 could be accommodated in CCCs and quarantine centres.

Divisional commissioner Sanjeev Kumar said there have been no lapses in testing and treatment. “Cases are on steep rise so we implemented home isolation and home quarantine as per guidelines of the government which were approved two months ago,” he said.

Kumar added that 90% positive patients are “asymptomatic who can be isolated in homes and recover under supervision of administration”. “We have provided facility of CCCs and people who do not wish for home isolation can get treatment here. Also, we have provided facility of CCCs in private hotels for those who can afford it,” he said.

Mayor Sandip Joshi said the decision for home isolation should not have been taken especially as there are only 1,700 cases. “Officials had claimed for capacity up to 5,000. Where are those facilities? Who will be responsible in case of no monitoring on home isolation and increase in cases,” he asked.

Rakshit Dubey, a Class IX student, says,” This sudden hurdle made us fear we’d lose this means to continue learning. But I am happy that classes have resumed.” Another student, Ishani Joshi, Class VII, adds, “Online classes ensure that our day ends without boredom. This gap made me realize the importance of online connection with schools.”

Manini Shah, another student of Class IX says, “I was scared that our studies will be stopped. But I am happy to learn that my school was equally concerned about my future and decided to start classes again. Now, the government should withdraw its decision.”

The joy was no less among the parents. “It was a delight to see my children back in their academic routine. I am thankful to the school for giving children’s future priority over the ongoing tussle,” says Sushma Bansal, a parent of two.

Another parent, Mona Shah, says, “I was greatly concerned when informed that online classes are being stopped. School connect is crucial to maintain academic rhythm. Schools also understood the connection and I am glad for the amazing decision they have taken.”

Mahesh Dani, a parent adds, “Is it possible for the government of Gujarat to provide quality education to my child? Private schools are there only because the government has failed on this front completely.”

Talking to TOI, Archit Bhatt, president of Ahmedabad Schools Progressive Management Association, says, “Schools have resumed online classes keeping in mind the academic interests of the students. We are waiting for the decision of honourable high court and have assured teachers that we will do our best to safeguard their interests.” He added, “The government should come forward and pay the salaries of all educators and support them as it is a survival issue for them.”

PUNE: With schools unlikely to open anytime soon, many migrant workers who used to drive school vans in the city are without any job for the past four-five months.

While many of them are returning to the city with the hope of finding work, Akshay Patole (28) and his brother Akash (26) -- school van drivers until a few months back -- have no such plans. “After the closure of schools due to the pandemic, we tried hard to look for jobs in Pune but couldn’t find any. So, we headed home,” said Akshay.

Both the brother currently work as farm hands at Khamaswadi village in Osmanabad district . “I used to earn Rs12,000 a month as a school van driver and Akash used to earn Rs11,000. After schools closed, we were left without jobs. We exhausted our savings in a few days and didn’t have money to pay rent. I have two children and my brother got married recently,” he said.

The Patoles booked a 17-seater bus, took whatever they could and headed home paying Rs11,000 to the driver. “Now, we work as daily wagers on farms and earn Rs200 to Rs250 per day,” said Akshay.

185,['29/07/2020'],"Eateries flout rules, remain open beyond allowed time","LUDHIANA: In a city where coronavirus cases are rising sharply, eateries are flouting rules by keeping shops open after 9pm and serving food in cars and even allowing walk-ins.

On Monday, TOI did a reality check in the city and found a large number of food outlets open after the permissible time limit of 9pm. At several joints, a large number of cars and bikes were spotted and people were seen consuming food inside their vehicles. Some people were even seen inside the outlets.

At some spots, the servers were seen attending to guests without gloves and there was a rush of customers at cash counters.

Around 9pm when they should be winding up, the outlets were seen serving customers. When TOI lensman started clicking pictures of four food outlets under the Dhuri line bridge, several customers and staff got together and asked him to delete them. Some unidentified persons started dropping names of other mediapersons and police officers, and when they failed to convince him, they threatened him. PCR officers present at the spot had to intervene to control the situation.

All the shops soon started shutting down and within a few minutes, the entire market was closed. Some customers left without paying their bills.

After this, the team surveyed Sarabha Nagar around 9.30pm, and found that though the main market was closed, cops were getting shutters of several nearby food outlets down. Two outlets — an ice-cream joint and a sweetmeat shop — were open and after the photojournalist clicked the pictures, some unknown persons in an SUV followed his bike and constantly kept asking him to stop. But when he reached near a PCR picket, the SUV fled.

Speaking to the TOI, deputy commissioner Varinder Sharma said, “As per existing guidelines, after 9pm no outlet is allowed to open, for dine-in or delivery. Police have been asked to take strict action against the violators and those visiting these outlets after allowed time too should stop the practice.”

Chew on this

As per rules, the closing time of shops, restaurants, food outlets and all other establishments is 9pm

It’s mandatory for the staff to wear masks and observe social distancing rules

Restaurants are allowed to open with 50% occupancy

Liquor can be served, provided the restaurant has a valid permission from the excise department. However, bars will remain closed

Restaurants in hotels are allowed to serve food, including buffet meals, to up to 50% of their seating capacity. These restaurants will also be open to persons other than hotel guests, but bars will remain closed. However, liquor can be served in the rooms

Rajkot: The gloom caused by the Covid-19 pandemic was drowned in cheers and smiles at Jamnagar’s Kasturba Stree Vikas Gruh (KSVG) on Tuesday.

In what is probably the first adoption after June, a Delhi-based couple adopted two twins — a boy and a girl — from the facility. A small function with social distancing was organized to celebrate the event at the orphanage.

The twins, Bharat and his sister Bharati, who turned two in March, were adopted by Amit Shrivastav and his wife Archana. Shrivastav is a vice-president in a private company while Archana is a clinical psychologist.

Karsan Dangar, trustee of KSVG, said, “After five months, this is the first case of adoption here. The process is managed centrally and we followed the order. We conducted Covid-19 test for both children and submitted the report in court along with other documents.”

The couple was waiting for the adoption for the past two years.

Talking to TOI, Shrivastava said, “We were concerned about Covid situation but Jamnagar had less cases in the initial stage when we were approached by the agency. We were eagerly waiting for the past two years, so there was no question of saying no.”

He said, “We too had done our Covid-19 tests before starting from Delhi.”

“We wanted two children to complete our family. We had applied for one child but when we came to know that two children are there to be adopted as they are twins, it was like a bumper draw for us,” added Shrivastav.

188,['29/07/2020'],"Deputy mayor, husband at loggerheads with mayor over ration","Representative image

LUDHIANA: The deputy mayor, Sarabjit Kaur, and her husband Jarnail Singh Singh Shimlapuri are once again hogging the limelight, this time for raising the issue of ‘non distribution of ration’ against their own party mayor, though they had been asked to provide a list of beneficiaries.

They wrote letters to cabinet minister Bharat Bhushan Ashu, Punjab Pradesh Congress Committee president Sunil Jakhar and several other leaders in the party. While Sarabjit claimed that she and her husband, who is a president of a block in south constituency, were being victimised due to internal party politics, Congress leaders and her rivals in south constituency claimed Shimlapuri was desirous of getting prime position in the constituency, so he is adopting such tactics to remain in the news.

A controversy had risen earlier when the deputy mayor had written a letter to the Congress high command, complaining against mayor Balkar Sandhu that the latter was not treating her husband properly and even she was being ignored. However, that dispute had ended when the mayor personally visited the deputy mayor and her husband and sorted out the issues. But once again they are in news for their letter. This time they have alleged that they did not get ration for distribution, whereas the nodal officer in the area had demanded a list of beneficiaries from them.s

While talking about the issue, deputy mayor Sarabjit Kaur said, “We did not interfere in the ongoing ration distribution programme going on under the aegis of the state government as we only wanted that the ration reached the poor, instead of getting involved in politics over ration like other leaders did during lockdown. But recently my husband got a call from area officer that ration had come for distribution in ward number 35 from where I am the councillor and he asked for the list of beneficiaries. We prepared a list of 1,500 people and sent it to the person concerned, who again informed about arrival of ration in the area.”

She said the residents who were supposed to get ration also came to their office but even after waiting for almost an entire day no ration was made available. She said residents were now blaming and accusing them of taking away their ration.

The deputy mayor said they have always tried to help the poor but this incident had damaged their image and this had been done intentionally.

Meanwhile, requesting anonymity one of the Congress leaders from south constituency said, “Actually, Jarnail Singh Shimlapuri had desire to contest as MLA from south constituency in 2017, but he was not given a chance. Besides, his wife was made deputy mayor after the MC elections. He wants to become in-charge of this constituency and his relations are not very cordial with the present in-charge of this constituency.”

He said these letters were being sent intentionally to gain popularity and to remain in the notice of senior leaders.

But when contacted Shimlapuri dismissed such claims. “""We are raising only those issues which are important. We have no personal interests in ration distribution and other things. Some politics is going against us in the constituency and we are only fighting against it.”

MUMBAI: The last in the season this year, SSC ( Secondary School Certificate , Class X) results will be announced at 1pm today. Over 18 lakh students who appeared for the exams can check results on www.mahresult.nic.in

Maharashtra State Board of Secondary and Higher Secondary Education (MSBSHSE) conducted the exam in February and March. The last paper, Geography, scheduled for March 23, was cancelled due to Covid-19. Students will be awarded average marks they have scored in other papers for the subject.

Nearly four lakh students took the exam from Mumbai division, consisting of Mumbai, Palghar, Raigad and Thane. In the state’s nine divisions, around 65,000 more than last year appeared.

In 2019, SSC results were hit and the state saw the lowest success rate since 2006 as internal exams were scrapped. The 20-mark internal marking system of language and social studies subjects came back this year. “The results are a reflection of the year-long efforts students have put in and I want to wish them all the best for their future,” said education minister Varsha Gaikwad in a video message on twitter.

After results are announced, students can apply at http://verification.mh-ssc.ac.in for re-counting of scores between July 30-August 8. Students can request photocopies of answer-sheets between July 30-August 18 on the board’s official site. Once students receive the photocopy, they can apply for re-evaluation or re-assessment within five days. Fees have to be paid online.

190,['29/07/2020'],Only timely construction of grand Ram temple on our agenda now: VHP,"Alok Kumar

With construction of Ram Temple scheduled to kickstart on August 5 with ‘ Bhoomipujan ’ of the Ramjanmabhoomi site in Ayodhya , the Vishwa Hindu Parishad, which spearheaded the movement, watches closely. Its national working president Alok Kumar tells Pankaj Shah that a grand temple would symbolise emancipation of Hindu faith which remained crushed for years by a few vested interests.

Kumar said that the development of the proposed temple would pave way for development of Ayodhya as a prominent cultural hotspot for millions of Hindus the world over.

Q: Finally, the construction of Ram temple is set to begin with bhoomipujan on August 5. Do you think that the target of VHP has been achieved?

A: I believe the target was achieved when the Supreme Court delivered its verdict in favour of the Ram temple. The proposed construction of a grand temple is the rejuvenation of the Hindu society which has been marred by domination of a few vested interests. It is the mark of emancipation of Hindus who have been struggling for the cause for nearly 500 years. We now have to move further and see that construction of Ram temple picks up pace and gets completed in the next 3 to 3.5 years.

Q: Do you think that Ram temple would continue to be at the epicentre of politics like it has been for years? Or, is it the end of it?

A: It would no longer be at the centre of agenda of any political party now. The Ram temple movement has forced all political parties to respect Hindu sentiments and faith. We would like the temple to be a symbol of national importance to be projected beyond politics of a party.

Q: How do you plan to showcase construction of Ram temple as a beacon of Hindu aspiration and faith?

A: It has been a long drawn battle which VHP fought for years. Finally, we have managed to awaken the soul of Hindus. The inferiority complex that had gripped the Hindu society for decades has now gone. Hindus are no more seized but are now free to project their aspirations before the world. And that’s exactly what we would talk of and continue to motivate the Hindu society for in due course of time.

Q: What are VHP’s plans? Are Kashi and Mathura on the agenda?

A: Only timely construction of a grand Ram temple is on our agenda. We have been and would continue to strive for it till we achieve the goal. There is no other agenda for the VHP as of now. I repeat. There is nothing else on our agenda.

Q: What about development of Ayodhya as a whole?

A: While the massive Ram temple will be the centre of attraction for the whole world, the city of Ayodhya will be and should be developed as a great pilgrimage centre. We hope that the state government would understand the socio-cultural-religious ethos of the city and develop it accordingly. We assume that Ayodhya would be the next tourist hotspot.

Q: Do you see any challenge from here as far as the timely construction of Ram temple is concerned?

A: All challenges saw an end when the apex court delivered its verdict in November. We hope that a grand temple would be constructed timely and as per the expectation of Hindus across the world.

Besides being booked under Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Act, the driver Jabir Hussain Sheikh (26) has also been accused of cruelty and criminal intimidation by his wife Azimabanu (25).

In her police complaint , Azimabanu stated that everything was fine between her and Jabir for a year after their marriage in December 2015. Later, she became suspicious that Jabir was having an extra-marital affair. Azimabanu alleged that when she told her mother-in-law Sehrajbanu , she assured her that Jabir will correct himself. However, when Azimabanu confronted Jabir, he became furious and broke her phone. Soon, Jabir resorted to violence and verbal altercations. Police said that Azimabanu continued tolerating mental and physical harassment as she did not want to ruin her three-year-old daughter’s future.

In October 2019, the ministry had invited objections for the draft notification. However with not much resistance from the locals and other lobbies, the draft notification now stands finalised. Decades ago, the locals had opposed the formation of Kudremukh National Park citing difficulties for their livelihood.

Sanjay Mohan, PCCF and head of forest force, said it is a welcome move. “There was no objection to announcing this area as Eco-sensitive Zone,” he said.

G Veeresh, honorary wildlife warden from Chikkamagaluru, said the move will help in the protection of ecology in and around Kudermukh National Park. “Many activities have been banned inside the eco-sensitive zones. This will further ensure the safety of the wildlife,” he said, adding: “There were no objections for this eco-sensitive notification by anyone. It is also a welcome trend.”

As per the notification, 51 villages — the highest — coming under the new zone are in Mudigere taluk (Chikkamagalur). “It is good for environment. Its impact on the common man is yet to be ascertained,” said Sudhakar D, a resident of Kottigehara.

A division bench comprising chief justice Indrajit Mahanty and justice Vijay Bishnoi directed the insurance company to release the payment within 4 weeks while hearing a petition by the farmers with a prayer of direction to the company to release the claim amount due for the years 2016 and 2017. According to the petitioners’ counsel Moti Singh Rajpurohit, the farmers had obtained insurance of their crop under Pradhan Mantri Fasal Beema Yojna and had paid their premium through Kissan Credit Cards and Gram Sahkari Sewa Samiti (GSSS) by way of auto debit.

“But then, the insurance company did not determine claims to these farmers for the year 2016 and 2017. Then the GSSS sent communication to the Jodhpur Central Cooperative Bank intimating about the matter”, said Rajpurohit.

But when GSSS did not receive any response from the bank, the farmers moved high court in 2019 through the sarpanch.

“On this petition, the court directed the insurance company in February to determine the total amount of claim due to the farmers. As per the determination, total amount of claim for the year was Rs 81 lakh”, said Rajpurohit, adding that the same for the year 2017 was yet to be determined by as an approximation it was Rs 91 lakh.

On Monday, the bench was told by the company that they were not yet in receipt of the subsidy from the state government as well as the premium from the cooperative bank. On this argument, the bench stated that all the respondents comprising the state government, insurance company and the bank should settle the matter among themselves and poor farmers should not suffer due to the pending issue between these 3 parties.

199,['29/07/2020'],Drip irrigation helps farmers to grow vegetables throughout year,"During the lockdown, the cultivators grew 18,000kg vegetables and earned Rs 5.40 lakh

UDAIPUR: Farmers of some 20 villages in remote patches of Jhadol and Phalasiya panchayat samitis (90 kilometre from district headquarters), a part of the Wakal river basin, were once dependent on monsoon for cultivation and used to harvest only one crop in a year. But now they are growing vegetables throughout the year, thanks to drip irrigation .

The drip irrigation project was launched here four years ago by a UK-based organization Water Harvest (WH) and NGO Mahan Seva Sansthan working in the area of water conservation . It is a controlled irrigation technique wherein water is allowed to drip slowly to the roots of plants, either from soil surface or buried below the surface, thereby efficiently using water and nutrients. The organization had borne the entire expenses of laying drip systems in the fields.

“Some fifty farmers who laid the drip system in their farms, are now growing vegetables throughout the year and making good profits. While many men in these villages who worked as daily wagers in other states, had to return due to the Covid crisis, these farmers and their families remained unaffected by the pandemic. Seeing them, others are inspired to take up farming and quitting labour jobs,” O P Sharma, country director, WH told TOI.

During the lockdown period alone, i.e., March to June, the cultivators grew 18,000 kilograms of vegetables and earned Rs 5.40 lakh. Vegetables like tomato, brinjal, lady finger, cluster bean, chilli, onion, potato, cauliflower, peas and leafy vegetables were grown in plenty.

“The farmers had advantages during the lockdown as villagers feared to go out to procure vegetables from markets that had become super spreaders of the virus and hence they purchased directly from the neighborhood farms,” Sharma said.

Drip irrigation is gaining popularity as power cuts are frequent in the villages and large areas can be covered through less operation hours of the system. It saves water, electricity, labour cost and avoids flooding in the fields.

“Earlier, I used to grow grains and pulses once a year in the season and the rest of the months would migrate to other cities to take up menial labour jobs. But after adopting the drip system, I grow veggies throughout the year. I earned Rs 22,000 by cultivating green chillies only during the lockdown period,” Dhamilal Pargi of Kherad village said.

In the next stage, the NGOs are expanding the drip project to 500 more farmers in 72 villages.

“To set up the drip irrigation system in a farm measuring one bigha, it costs approximately Rs 40,000. We are collaborating with the government of Rajasthan which will bear 70% of the expense, while the remaining would be borne by us,” Sharma informed.

200,['29/07/2020'],Gujarat: Chacha-bhatiji battle social fallout of sata-pata,"AHMEDABAD: This uncle and niece are suffering the social fallout of sata-pata, a regressive tradition practised in some communities , where a man and a woman from one family are married to a man and a woman from another. If one marriage breaks, the other has to break irrespective of whether that marriage was healthy!

Minal, 30, was bartered for marriage of his uncle Kalu, 35, in Pethapur village of Gandhinagar district . After Minal was abandoned by her husband, her uncle’s marriage too was broken and his wife forced by her family to leave him following the sata-pata tradition.

The uncle and niece are now subjected to cruel remarks by villagers. As she was dumped by her husband, many villagers see Minal as vulnerable and often deride her and try to attack her dignity.

Recently, her uncle was assaulted after he tried to protect Milanfrom a drunkard who sought sexual favours from her.

According to Kalu, a resident of Pethapur and member of an OBC community, he and his niece Minal had been married through the barter system three years ago in Mehsana . Minal’s husband abandoned her over constant domestic quarrels and Kalu’s wife also returned to her parents.

Since then, Kalu and Minal have been living in Pethapur village. Some villagers began to cast doubts on Minal's character and holding her responsible for being dumped by her husband.

On July 22, a villager named Thakor grabbed Minal’s hand and dragged her to a secluded place behind a shop. Minal told TOI, “He was making vulgar remarks while dragging me. I could sense he was heavily drunk. When I tried to resist, he pushed me on the ground and began beating me.”

Kalu, who was returning home, saw Minal being beaten by Thakor. He rushed to rescue her but Thakor overpowered him and pushed him down, and hit him on his head with an iron rod.

Severely bleeding, Kalu was hospitalized in a government hospital for a day. A medico-legal case was filed and Pethapur police registered an assault case against Thakor.

Kalu said that the villagers regularly taunt him and his niece over their broken barter marriage. “People used to harass us a lot before the police complaint was filed. Now, they keep a distance from us,” he said.

202,['29/07/2020'],"Faisal, Rabins had hawala ties: Customs","Kochi: Faisal Fareed and Rabins Karikkankudiyil had close associations with hawala operatives in the UAE , said Customs sleuths, probing the Thiruvananthapuram gold smuggling case, on Tuesday. Sources said their arrest will be crucial to establish the larger conspiracy behind the smuggling operation and identifying other links of the accused, abroad.

""Rabins was a close associate of Faisal, who made major investments in the smuggling operation. We have credible info of Rabins’s links with hawala operatives in the UAE. We have already identified a few other persons based in the UAE who are part of the racket,"" said a senior customs official.

Customs officials had earlier hinted that persons in UAE, having links with the racket, were the same persons who had connections with a Muvattupuzha-based racket that smuggled around 1,500kg of gold between 2013 and 2015. Customs found more details about Rabins after questioning Jalal, a close aide of mastermind Ramees, who also had links with Muvattupuzha gang. ""The names, which are coming up during the probe (to find other members of the racket in UAE), are the same names associated with Muvattupuzha case. Our probe will bust the entire network, including those residing abroad,"" said an official.

Customs said that current investigation is focused on analysing collected evidence and statements of the 16 accused. ""Even before the baggage was formally opened on July 5, we had information on several persons involved in smuggling. The investigation was conducted with a strong plan backed by credible intelligence. In a little over three weeks we arrested 16 persons. Now, before gunning for the rest of the network, we are taking a breather and analysing what we have,"" said an official.

Sources said Customs was hoping that Swapna, Sandeep and Ramees would give them useful information during questioning that will establish the connection of the syndicate’s UAE links. Earlier on Tuesday, additional chief judicial magistrate court (economic offences) issued a non-bailable warrant (NBW) against Faisal and Rabins. Customs sleuths said they will now approach Interpol, through CBI, and file NBW along with a report on the accused so that a red-corner notice can be issued to extradite them.

Bail pleas dismissed

Meanwhile, the court dismissed the bail applications of Hamjad Ali K, Mohammed Anwar TM, Samju TM, Jifsal CV and Mohammed Abdul Shameem.Additional chief judicial magistrate Deepu C observed that instant release of the accused will hamper the progress of the investigation. ""I find great force in the submission of the special prosecutor that petitioners are likely to tamper with evidence, influence witnesses and help the absconding accused in the event of granting bail. In the result, applications are dismissed,"" court order said.

Customs had submitted a petition requesting the custody of Jalal AM, Muhammed Shafi, Said Alavi E, Muhammed Anwar TM, Hamjad Ali, Abdul Hammed, Abubacker Pazhedath, Muhammed Abdu Shameem, Jifsal CV and Abdu PD. The court remanded Jalal, Shafi and Hamjad Ali in Customs custody till 5pm on Wednesday. The custody of the rest is till 5pm on Thursday.

However, compared to other tier II cities such as Trichy and Madurai, the city has handled only a meagre number of rescue flights.

The civil aviation ministry had cancelled all domestic and international flight operations across the country from March 22. After that, the city airport handled only a few chartered flights and cargo flights from Dubai and Sharjah. While the Centre introduced flights under Vande Bharat Mission in May, the city airport received its first rescue flight, which flew down from Dubai with 180 passengers, only on June 3.

By July 28, the airport saw 21 such flights from Sharjah, Dubai, Singapore, Brunei, Doha, Muscat and Nairobi. Most of the flights were from Sharjah, followed by Singapore and Muscat. Earlier, the city airport was connected only to three international destinations.

Chennai airport handled 144 rescue flights and 20,824 passengers, the highest in the state, followed by Trichy airport that received 83 flights and 13,887 passengers and Madurai airport, which recorded 28 flights and 5,339 passengers.

Aviation enthusiast say the city airport has all the infrastructure in terms of runway, staff and systems to handle any number of international flights.

“It just needs more political will to bring more attention to the city airport and promote it in the international sector. The airport can definitely handle more flights,” said R Raveendran, Residents Awareness Associations of Coimbatore.

The airport authorities say they hadn’t faced any challenges in handling international flights. “Except for wearing the protective gear, which took us some time to get used to, we faced no issues,” said R Mahalingam, city airport director.

206,['29/07/2020'],"Now, Jitu Patwari’s poster surfaces on social media","Jitu Patwari (File photo)

BHOPAL: Poster war intensified within the state Congress on Tuesday after a third placard went viral on the social network, this time claiming former minister Jitu Patwari as the youth face of the party. Recently, two more posters surfaced, one claiming senior leader Digvijaya Singh’s son Jaivardhan as future chief minister and another of former chief minister Kamal Nath’s son Nakul Nath as youth leader of the party.

While BJP took a dig at the entire commotion over posters, Congress claimed it is the ruling party’s conspiracy before the assembly bypolls.

On Tuesday, a poster appeared on the social media which said, “Naa Raja, naa vyapari. Abki baar Jeetu Patwari. Dekho dekho kaun ayaa, sher ayya, sher aaya (Not king, not trader. This time it will be Jitu Patwari. See the Tiger has come). King here would mean former minister Jaivardhan Singh, since he hails from the royal family of Raghogarh and trader is Nakul Nath since he hails from a business background despite being son of one of the senior most politicians of the country.

This poster is being seen as a reply to two earlier posters. The first appeared on a bill board in the MP Nagar area of the state capital on Jaivardhan Singh’s birthday. The poster said, “Madhya Pradesh ke bhabi mukhya mantra Jaivardhan Singh ko janamdin kid hero shubh kamnaye (wishing the future chief minister of Madhya Pradesh Jaivardhan Singh on his birthday).

Within half-an-hour, the poster was removed and Jaivardhan Singh registered an FIR against an alleged Jyotiraditya Scindia supporter Krishna Ghadke for the mischief.

Soon a second poster surfaced on the social media which claimed, “Kamal Nath ji ka aadesh, Nakul Nath sambhalo pradesh. Madhya Pradesh ka asli Tiger (Kamal Nath’s order, Nakul Nath take care of the state. Real tiger of Madhya Pradesh).” Media also showed Nakul Nath saying he will lead the youth of the state.

But Congress explained that Nakul Nath has difficulty expressing himself in Hindi. “What he meant was he will work with the youth of the party and the state,” said state PCC spokesman JP Dhanopia. “Nakul Nath is an elected MP and while speaking to the media said he will work with all other youth leaders of the party. His statement has been misrepresented. And these two posters of Nakul Nath and Jeetu Patwari on the social media is dirty game played by the BJP,” Dhanopia added.

Reacting to Tuesday’s poster on Jeetu Patwari, former minister PC Sharma said, “Right now we have one focus and that is to contest the bypolls under the leadership of senior leader Kamal Nath. We will decide on patwari, tehsildar and collector later.”

Jeetu Patwari also clarified, “Our leader is Kamal Nath and the youth brigade is led by MP Nakul Nath. We are all together and will expose the BJP’s failures.”

However, minister for urban development Bhupendra Singh tweeted, “Seems like the Youth Congress before the elections have decided to send @OfficeOfKNath and @digvijaya_28 towards vanprastha.” And on Monday, home minister Narottam Mishra had said, “In the Congress Youth will be led by Nakul Nath, elderly by Kamal Nath and the rest will be anath (orphans).”

207,['29/07/2020'],From selling school uniforms to food items on bike,"LUDHIANA: In another case of survival amid the crisis triggered by the Covid-19 pandemic, a 45-year-old local shopkeeper, Manjeet Singh of Shimlapuri, has been forced to give up his seven-year-old profession of selling school uniforms and grocery items and indulge in the business of selling home made food items to people on a roadside in the posh locality of Ghumar Mandi on his two wheeler bullet motorcycle to sustain his livelihood.

After the governing bodies decided to shut down all school institutions in view of restricting the spread of Covid-19, the business of selling uniforms totally got stopped and this forced him to look for some other way of earning livelihood to deal with the crisis.

After working for the last seven years in the profession of selling uniforms to local people in Shimlapur, Singh had been faced a financial crisis after the government imposed strict lockdown in the last five months. He had no choice but to sell several food items to customers on his bullet motorcycle on roadside in Ghumar Mandi.

Singh said, “It’s the sixth days since I started selling food items on my motorcycle after I have found this is the only way I can survive under these conditions of lockdown because I had closed my years old business of selling uniforms to locals. It’s really a challenging task of selling food items while standing on city roads in hot and humid weather conditions from early morning till evening for earning almost Rs 300-400 for managing household expenses.”

He further said, “Earlier, I had not imagined in my dreams that one day I would have to sell food items this way for earning livelihood as in this situation the opening of schools and colleges might get delayed further. But after the outbreak of Covid-19 along with imposition of lockdown in the country, almost every business has been hit and the struggle of earning bread and butter has forced many people to give up their years old profession and start something afresh to earn money.”

Singh added that, “I have three children and wife and I am the sole breadwinner of my family because my daughter is still studying and responsibility of managing household expenses falls on my shoulders which forced me to leave my comfort zone and start doing the business of selling food.”

“I have no big savings, no big capital, so I started selling food items on my motorcycle which I had purchased five years back when my business was in full pace and I was earning good profit. I have lost all our savings in the past several months while managing the basic household expenses and paying house loans and electricity bills and car loan, which we had taken few months back,” he said.

In Jaipur, 506 asymptomatic patients have been kept in home isolation.

212,['29/07/2020'],Uproar over online ‘technical glitch’ in two city schools,"Ahmedabad: In what has been called a ‘technical glitch’ by managements of the two schools, about 200 students of Udgam School and Zebar School For Children found their access to social media groups for online classes abruptly removed. They were added back following backlash from parents on social media who alleged that their wards were bearing the brunt of the stand-off between the state government and self-financed schools.

The concerned students were shocked to find on Monday morning, when online classes were to resume after a 3-day gap, their contact numbers had been removed from the online sharing platforms and they no longer had access to participate in online classes.

Though school authorities claimed it was a technical glitch that was subsequently rectified and the access of the students granted, some parents alleged it happened in cases of students whose parents had not paid tuition fees. School authorities brushed off the allegations as baseless.

“There was a technical glitch in the system and we have restored the error. Students who have paid fees got removed as well,” said Manan Choksi, a trustee of Udgam School and Zebar School. “It was unintentional and all of the students have been added back for online classes. There are 7,000 students in the two schools of which 200 students were removed by mistake,” Choksi said.

There are about 150 parents in these two schools who have not paid school fees for their wards. They claimed that the school’s abrupt decision was part of an attempt to oppose the recent state government directive of not collecting tuition fees from parents for lockdown period.

Calling it an unfortunate incident, Naresh Shah, president of Gujarat Vali Mandal, said they will make representation to the state government about the matter.

The government’s recent notification has also directed schools not to hike fees for the academic year 2020-21. Schools that have already collected fees from parents will have to adjust them when the schools re-open physically.

The decision has not gone down well with many schools, many of who have challenged the government’s directive in Gujarat high court.

BHOPAL: Wearing a blue hospital gown, chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan held a virtual cabinet meeting from his Covid ward on Tuesday, his fourth day in hospital after being detected with the virus.Chouhan, who has been regularly holding review meetings despite being in hospital, told his cabinet colleagues that he no longer has cough or fever. He asked the administration to prepare 12,000 hospital beds for Corona patients (8,000 now), and increase the number of ICU beds from 827 to 1700.Home minister Narottam Mishra claimed this was the first virtual cabinet meeting in the country where all the ministers, located in different parts of the state, connected via video.According to Mishra, CM Chouhan told ministers that lockdown cannot be a permanent solution and asked for suggestions from the cabinet. The ministers were told that 20,300 patients have recovered in MP and the state has 70% recovery rate.Going by Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s call for Atmanirbhar Bharat, the CM asked ministers to work out a plan to create a selfreliant Madhya Pradesh. Every minister has been asked to make a plan for self-reliance for their department and submit it by August 15,” Mishra said. The cabinet decided to change the name of the proposed Chambal Expressway to ‘Chambal Progressway’.This four-lane, 309km highway from the Rajasthan border to Morena and Bhind is one of the 22 greenfield highways to be constructed by the Union government.“The change of name is welcome because Chambal is generally associated with dacoits and desperados, but will now be an industrial area, opening up opportunities for employment. It is during Shivraj Singh Chouhan’s tenure that Chambal became peaceful,” the home minister said.The state will give land for the ‘progressway’ free of cost. “If farmers’ land is acquired then government will give land in exchange,” Mishra said.The cabinet decided to take the Prime Minister’s Swanidhi Yojana loan scheme for city vendors to the rural level. “It applies to areas under municipal corporations and municipalities. We will take it to janpadh, village and town panchayats with Mukhya Mantri Path Vikreta Yojana. Under this, loans of Rs 10,000 will be extended to blacksmiths, potters, barbers, vendors and small shopkeepers,” the minister explained.The government has received 8.56 lakh applications, and ministers will hold functions to distribute loans to beneficiaries, Mishra said.Between 2013 and 2018, the Shivraj government had upgraded 22 village panchayats to town panchayats, which was cancelled by the Kamal Nath government. On Tuesday, the cabinet reinstated the status of 21 of them, with Keolari in Datia being left out. The minister said residents of Keolari will be consulted before upgrading the panchayat.The government approved continuing with the PM Fasal Bima Yojana for 2020-2021 for Rabi crops and 2021-2022 for Kharif crops.The Congress protested as videos of the cabinet meeting allegedly went viral.“This cabinet meeting was held to get publicity,” said state Congress spokesman Durgesh Sharma. “All the ministers have taken oath of secrecy and yet make a cabinet meeting go viral via several portals. Hackers could have hacked into the meeting. How justified was it to call a virtual cabinet meeting? The CM did not take cabinet meetings for weeks after his swearing-in.

AHMEDABAD: The Gujarat high court on Monday granted anticipatory bail to the MD and CEO of Kalorex Group and a trustee in the Delhi Public School (East), Manjula Pooja Shroff , in connection with the complaint of forgery of an NOC to get CBSE affiliation for the school in 2010.

Justice A J Desai granted conditional protection against arrest to Shroff. She will have to furnish bail bond of Rs 25,000 and surrender her passport. The HC has protected her against arrest ever since she had filed anticipatory bail plea in December 2019.

Along with Shroff, two other persons, Hiten Vasant and former principal of the school Anita Dua, have also sought anticipatory bail and their bail pleas are pending in the HC.

These three approached the high court seeking anticipatory bail after a sessions court at the Mirzapur district court campus denied bail to them. The legal protection was sought after the state education department lodged an FIR with Vivekanand Nagar police for alleged forgery.

The issue came to the fore after a man filed a complaint of illegal detention of his children in an ashram run by Nithyananda, which was operational on DPS (East) campus in Hathijan.

Cyber crime cell sleuths said they have also come across such a fraud for the first time as the complainant claimed that the mobile number of the company which was linked with the bank account had become non-functional.

The complaint was lodged by Priyank Patel, an employee of Unique Construction. The money was transferred by the fraudster to different bank accounts. In all, 24 transactions of Rs 10 lakh or less amounts were made to transfer the money bank accounts registered in different locations in the country.

On Monday morning, when Patel tried to login to netbanking for checking the bank statement, he couldn’t. The construction firm has its account in Bank of Baroda’s Bhatar Road branch. Patel tried to log-in twice but a message of wrong credentials kept popping up. Patel avoided a third attempt as the net banking facility would have got locked automatically.

Patel rushed to the bank to check and the officials there informed him that total Rs 1.71 crore have been transferred to different accounts through NEFT/RTGS in the early hours of Monday. Later, when he checked, the mobile number of Unique Construction which was linked with the account had also become non-functional. He could not make or receive calls from the number.

“It is a tricky investigation for us as well since we have come across such a crime for the first time. We are investigating how the number stopped functioning and the accused got access to the bank account,” said an officer of cyber-crime police station.

An unidentified person has been booked for cheating under Indian Penal Code and also under IT Act.

217,['29/07/2020'],UP: Gorakhpur airport fastest growing in north India,"Gorakhpur airport

LUCKNOW: Gorakhpur airport is fast emerging as one of the busiest airports of the state. In terms of number of passengers and flights, it is already fastest growing in north India .

Efforts had been continuing for the development of a civil airport inGorakhpur since mid-80s when Veer Bahadur Singh became the chief minister of the state. He tried hard to get it run on commercial lines, but his efforts did not fructify.

Yogi Adityanath as MP of Gorakhpur, too, tried to revive efforts and he even gained some success, but his steps started yielding results in a real sense when he was sworn in as chief minister of the state. From just two flights before 2017 to nine flights daily, from 300 passengers a day to 1,900 passengers daily (before outbreak of novel coronaviruspandemic), the Gorakhpur airport, having a terminal of just 144 square metre, has come a long way.

“With Yogi’s efforts, Gorakhpurairport has emerged as a fastest growing airport in northern India in terms of number of passengers and flights. In June 2019, 70,297 passengers had used this airport,” said an officer of the airport while talking to TOI. “When the corona situation would normalise the number of passengers would again pick up,” he added.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi had recently announced for speeding up work to make Kushinagarairport an international airport. A senior officer of civil aviation department said that by making such announcement the PM had intended to cater to international tourists visiting the Buddhist circuit. “But it could also be possible that the decision was taken to meet any emergency arising due to mounting tensions along borders with China and Nepal,” he said adding that development of Gorakhpur airport, too, is crucial as it would help eastern UP face any eventuality.

Given the flow of tourists at airports in Lucknow and Varanasi, Gorakhpur has acquired the third position in the state with six flights taking off and the same number making landings daily from here. On an average, the daily passenger count is about 2,000. Unlike Lucknow and Varanasi airports, the Gorakhpur has a staff of only eight, including airport director, two ground staff and five engineers.

While Gorakhpur airport is managed by state police, other airports of the state are being manned by central reserve police force. Additional chief secretary, home, Awanish Awasthi, had recently stated that a special force would be created in the state to man the airport security.

Meanwhile, the state government has decided to upgrade a civil airport at Ayodhya in view of construction of Ram temple. It would also have modern infrastructure, the officer added.

Health department officials, however, said adequate facilities were already in place in rural areas to treat Covid-19 patients. Pointing out that only 10% to 15% of the total cases in the district were from the rural areas, they said they were managing them in those areas itself.

The CPM MP said people from across the district had to now come to the ESI Hospital in the city for testing. “This has led people to crowd the hospital. They give samples for testing and wait at the hospital. Residents in the vicinity are concerned over local transmission of the virus. Heavy vehicular traffic in the area is also causing trouble.”

He said people, who were tested positive for the virus from rural areas, had to be brought to the city for treatment either in the ESI Hospital or in the Covid care centre at Codissia trade fair complex and the waiting time for the same was causing them mental stress. “Facilities to test and treat Covid-19 patients should be set up in taluk levels.”

On their part, health department officials said there were dedicated Covid-19 treatment centres in rural areas such as Mettupalayam, Pollachi, Bilichi and Annur.

Dr G Ramesh Kumar, deputy director of health services, said while they were bringing samples collected from rural areas to the ESI Hospital in the city for testing, those tested positive were admitted to Covid care centres in rural areas itself. “We have 43 patients with mild symptoms in the Hindustan Hospital in Mettupalayam and 45 in the Pollachi government hospital.”

He said the government hospital at Mettupalayam and Covid care centres at the Government Girls’ Higher Secondary School and NM Home in Pollachi, Sasurie Engineering College near Annur and another college at Bilichi near Perianaicken Palayam were ready to house Covid-19 patients from rural areas.

“We have been admitting only symptomatic patients from the city limits in the ESI Hospital and Codissia care centre. Those from rural areas are admitted to the facilities in their nearby areas. We have also been admitting patients from Madukkarai to the Pollachi government hospital,” the official said.

The deadline for redesigning the seven roads has been extended to August 2021 due to the Covid pandemic from the long gone deadline of December 2020.The CM said, “It is our dream to make Delhi look like other capital cities to present a good image of India across the world. A large number of foreigners come to Delhi and if they find roads here beautiful and congestion-free, the image of India is enhanced. The greenery along these roads will also help us to combat pollution.”A government official pointed out the problems caused to traffic by road bottlenecks and wide roads converging on narrow roads. The priority will be to remove such bottlenecks first to provide for smooth flow of traffic and an organised lane system, the official said.The second goal of the redesign is to increase the efficiency of existing roads and making the best use of road space . There will be measured and planned spaces for vehicles, non-motorised vehicles, footpaths and side-lanes on the stretches.The footpaths will be mapped to give pedestrians an average of 10 feet of space and will be redesigned and reconstructed to ensure there is no inconvenience for physically disadvantaged people.There will be space for planting trees on the sides of the footpaths and separately demarcated parking areas for electric vehicles and auto-rickshaws alongside the footpaths. The slope of the roads, as well as the drains, will be planned to tackle the problem of waterlogging on the roads. Rainwater harvesting structures will be built as part of the drainage systems to replenish the groundwater.Officials said that not even an inch of the surface of any road or roadside would be left uncovered to makes sure that dust on the roads would not elevate the pollution level.

AAP also held a protest march on Wednesday against the tax hike announced by South Delhi Municipal Corporation. The march started from the party headquarters and police stopped and detained the protesters before they reached the BJP headquarters.

Meanwhile, North Delhi Municipal Corporation House leader, Yogesh Verma, has issued “criminal and civil defamation notices of Rs 1 crore against AAP MLAs Raghav Chadha and Atishi for making corruption allegations in the municipal corporations.”

The cash-strapped SDMC had on Monday slapped three new taxes - professional tax, effective hike in property tax on commercial properties and hike of 1% on transfer of property. AAP will continue to oppose the move, said party functionary Durgesh Pathak.

At a press conference, Atishi and Raghav stated that they have received the defamation notice. AAP will launch a statewide movement against corruption of the corporations, they announced. The AAP functionaries had recently raised the issue that the corporation had not paid salaries of doctors of Kasturba Gandhi Hospital and Hindu Rao Hospital during the Covid pandemic and called it unfortunate. “BJP is now trying to silence our voice,” they claimed.

“The BJP has sent criminal defamation notices against me and Raghav Chadha for raising the issue of corruption by BJP in the corporations,” Atishi said.

Verma accused AAP MLAs of making false allegations against the BJP-ruled corporation without any proof.

“AAP leaders Raghav Chadda and Atishi said that while the Delhi government has given all funds to the civic agency, its councillors have siphoned off the money and the employees are not getting salaries,” said the NDMC House leader.

“If the councillors have siphoned off the money, they should share the details, including names of councillors and and the amount, and our party will take strong action. Else, they can’t make such loose statements. I have served them legal notice and given seven days to prove their allegations or make a public apology. Otherwise, we will file a defamation case of Rs 1 crore against them in court,” he said.

NEW DELHI: A retired diplomat ’s email account was hacked recently and distress mails were sent from his account to his contacts asking for monetary help. The unsuspecting contacts, including some foreign dignitaries, subsequently transferred Rs 1.4 lakh to multiple bank accounts managed by the fraudsters.

Delhi Police has arrested one person in this connection and suspects involvement of an international cheating syndicate.

DCP (south) Atul Thakur said that Akram, the arrested culprit and a resident of Shaheen Bagh, was operating along with one Anees. The latter was in touch with some foreigners who had asked him to open 70-80 bank accounts in which they would transfer the money.

Akram would rent out his house to daily wagers and use their ID proofs to open the bank accounts under different names. The cops are in the process of identifying Anees and his foreign connections.

“We could trace down Akram from the bank accounts and the linked mobile phones. However, the cheating is being done through a network that is difficult to trail. Tracing the money trail often leads to a fake address or an identity in such cases,” said Thakur.

Akram told the cops that he received a commission of 8-10% for each transaction that happened through his accounts. It was found that the accounts were opened in different banks using the same address proof.

Earlier, the same technique was used to dupe a Kanpur-based businessman of Rs 70 lakh, a part of which was transferred to Akram too.

The gang used to target senior government officers and businessmen by hacking into their bank accounts using their email IDs and passwords.

Police are now trying to track down all the bank accounts in which the money was transferred. Sixteen ATM cards, 32 cheque books and several other documents related to the accounts were recovered from Akram.

The only centre in Maharashtra for Covaxin human trials – Dr Gillurkar’s Hospital and Research Institute— is conducting these trials. Three volunteers who got vaccine dose on July 27 are doing well, said Dr Chandrashekhar Gillukar, director of the institute.

“Our team is in touch with them. First batch of three will come for review on Day 14, which is August 11, while Tuesday’s batch of 4 will report on August 12. Their blood samples will be sent for testing the same day. We can expect the results in next two days,” Dr Gillurkar said. This means, the initial result of first phase will come by August 13 or 14.

“If these participants successfully develop antibodies in the first results, it would be big good news for us,” he added. They will be given a second dose and will be reviewed on Day 28.

“We started giving vaccines on July 27 but four other institutes out of the 12 test sites for these trials started earlier. They will get initial result even before us,” Gillurkar said.

On July 28, four men were administered the vaccine. A 20-year-old college student, two men aged 32 years and 35 years doing jobs in different private companies, and a 43-year-old businessman from Nagpur were given first dose. They were observed for two hours. As they had no immediate side-effects, they were allowed to go home.

About 30 people will be administered Covaxin in first phase trials at Nagpur centre, which is the only one in Maharashtra state. Participants are from Nagpur as well as other cities and towns of Maharashtra. Even now, many people are calling Dr Gillurkar and expressing interest in joining the trials.

224,['29/07/2020'],‘Demand creation crucial for MSMEs’ revival’,"Coimbatore: Lack of demand seems to be a large and looming problem for micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSMEs).

While shortage of raw material, liquidity and labour could be addressed through interventions, unless there was demand for MSME products and services, the sector couldn’t spring back to normalcy, said MSME representatives in an online discussion with their counterparts from across the country on Tuesday.

R Ramamurthy, president of the Coimbatore District Small Scale Industries Association (Codissia), said only if there was demand in the market, MSMEs could hope to revive. If Rs 3 lakh crore announced as relief for the MSME sector enters into the economy, adequate demand would be created, he said.

P Udayakumar, director of planning and marketing, National Small Industries Corporation (NSIC), said the crisis faced by the MSME sector now boils down to demand. “Finance and raw materials are available, but demand is lacking,” he said and added that if money was infused into other sectors, there would be activity there and it would increase demand for MSME products and services.

Of the Rs 3 lakh crore meant for emergency credit line guarantee (ECLG) scheme loans, only Rs 1.23 lakh crore has been sanctioned, of which, only Rs 68,311crore has been disbursed to MSMEs, he said. “Only if there is demand (for products), MSMEs would borrow (funds from banks),” he said.

Manguirish Pai Raiker, Chairman, National Council for MSME, the Associated Chambers of Commerce and Industry of India (Assocham), said MSMEs were now cautious to avail of loans. “We are waiting for demand to pick up,” he said.

Ramamurthy said Southern Railway told them it was ready to offer transport services for MSMEs. “If transportation cost comes down, MSMEs can cut costs by one-third and we can become competitive,” he said. Bodies such as the NSIC must procure raw materials in bulk and provide it to MSMEs, so that ‘undue profit’ would be eliminated from the value chain at this critical juncture, he added.

The webinar on ‘Aatma Nirbhar Bharat Packages for MSMEs: Challenges and Opportunities’, was organized by Assocham.

225,['29/07/2020'],"Gold smuggling case: Respite for Sivasankar, Kerala CM Pinarayi Vijayan wins first round","Pinarayi Vijayan, CM Kerala

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: At the beginning of gold smuggling case, chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan had welcomed probe by any agency into the involvement of anyone in his office in the case. “If they want to check my office, let them enter. What is the need for unwanted anxiety?” he had repeatedly asked reporters who posed questions on the case during daily news conferences.

When M Sivasankar walked out of NIA office in Kochi after two days of marathon interrogation, along with the CM – the entire leadership of LDF – heaved a sigh of relief.

The involvement of Sivasankar, his trusted principal secretary, in the case was a shock for Vijayan, initially. The CM then heard the version of Sivasankar in detail and decided to keep him out of office as it was clear that he had breached the code of conduct for officers.

“We still don’t know how the investigation is progressing. NIA will tell the court about it. The party has already welcomed the probe and clarified that anyone found guilty must face the consequences,” said CPM state committee member MB Rajesh. On the allegations levelled against the CM and CPM in the case, Rajesh said time would give a befitting reply to the opposition. “People are watching all these. They know all truth”, he added.

During CPM’s online politburo meet on Sunday, Vijayan repeated the position and assured the party that nobody found guilty would be spared. CPM Kerala unit and national leadership had no reasons to dispel his arguments. The consensus within CPM is not to defend anyone who would be linked to the case and keep the government separate from all controversies.

However, the government predicament is not likely to end as UDF and BJP are unlikely to put an end to the controversy. KPCC president Mullappally Ramachandran’s latest statement that there appeared to be a tacit understanding between CPM and BJP to settle the gold smuggling case is an indication of allegations that can be expected in coming days.

“The real issue here is the serious lapse on discharging constitutional responsibility by the chief minister. The official whom he had trusted, and relegated key responsibilities erred. The CM had been warned against his deviations earlier. We all saw what happened during Sprinklr controversy. Yet, he failed to monitor Sivasankar and take corrective steps. The CM should be held accountable for that. The fact is that knowingly or unknowingly a senior CMO official was providing cover for a smuggling racket. That fact is still there,” said political observer Joseph C Mathew.

The more than 30-hour interrogation of Sivasankar by Customs and NIA would be something the opposition has plans to cash in on in the coming days. The narrative that the investigation is going on and NIA can come back to Sivasankar would give them a convenient logic to support their attack on the government.

226,['29/07/2020'],Education interrupted as Delhi University falters,"Students claim that in spite of charging them Rs 1,000, DU has not responded to pleas for re-evaluation for tw... Read More

NEW DELHI: Riya Kwattra, who is pursuing a BSc degree in computer science from Delhi University , was one of the few students after her exams last year. She had to sit again for theory of computation paper in November/December to clear her exams. “When the results were announced in February, I was disappointed to find I had got the same result as earlier. Since then, I have written numerous letters to the university requesting re-evaluation ,” said the Bhiwani, Haryana, girl. “But even in all these months, the exam department is yet to respond.”

It is this sort of problems related to student issues that are making many people allege a systemic rot in DU, citing as evidence of this the faltering conduct of the mock online exams. They also point out how exam results have been delayed, how student grouses about incorrect assessment have increased and how re-evaluation is going nowhere.

Kwattra, despite several visits from her Haryana home to DU, hasn’t had her grievance looked into. “I do not even know when the results will be declared and if I will be eligible to sit for some entrance exams I am preparing for,” she sighed.

Her predicament is shared by Sharad Kumar, a BA student of Motilal Nehru Evening College. The resident of Rishikesh, Uttarakhand, sat for his exam in November/December “after rigorous tuitions for a year”, like Kwattra got a failed assessment again. Kumar, who wants to study in DU’s law faculty, said, “Clearly there is some fault with the evaluation. Many students have faced the same problem in different subjects. The National Students’ Union of India sent a letter to the dean of examination on this, with no impact.”

Tapsi Chadha and Somya Vats, 3rd year students of Hansraj College, also claimed that BA English (H) students were all mystified by their results. “First, the results were announced late. Then, the results were faulty. Many of us approached the university for re-evaluation, but none of us has got a response for two months now. In fact, they have not even acknowledged our requests after charging us Rs 1,000,” alleged Chadha.

Only last week, Delhi high court pulled up DU for withholding the degrees of five doctors who had graduated in 2018 from Lady Hardinge Medical College. The court was critical of the delay and wondered why DU couldn’t provide the students their degrees and marks transcripts through online means. The university has stated that it now has issued a tender for printing of the documents.

Rajesh Jha, member of DU’s Executive Council, also alleged, “The university’s examination system is in total chaos and students are forced to approach the judiciary for redress of their grievances. We teachers have received so many calls from the parents about arbitrariness in last semester’s results.” Professor Pankaj Garg too felt it wouldn’t be prudent to hold OBE from August 10 when re-evaluation of last semester’s exams was pending.

Numerous attempts to contact Vinay Gupta, dean of examinations, did not elicit any response.

More than 400 mobile shops, including service centres and the ones that sell spare parts, are located on the narrow lanes that are sandwiched between Cross Cut Road and 100-feet Road in Gandhipuram.

The area is considered a mobile phone hub, as phones are sold in bulk quantities to retailers in and around the district and because of the availability of rare accessories and spare parts.

Scores of people from across the district frequent the shops in the locality regularly. The shops on an average clock business to the tune Rs40 lakh a day.

Ever since the pandemic hit the country and social distancing become mandatory, the shopkeepers have been finding it difficult to manage the crowd, mainly because of lack of sufficient space.

S Mansoor Ali, president, Coimbatore District Mobile Sales and Service Association, said the shops on 1st to 10th streets of Gandhipuram would remain closed from Wednesday to Monday to help the city corporation to contain the spread of novel coronavirus.

“As the lanes are narrow, barricades were placed at the entry points to prevent vehicles from entering and congesting the area further. Yet, we were struggling to control the crowd.”

Pointing out that more than 2,000 people were dependent on the shops to make a living, he said business would be affected due to the closure. “But health is more important.”

Mobile shops in other parts of the district would, however, continue to function as usual.

228,['29/07/2020'],Leopard mauls retired teacher to death,"Place where Laxmidas Sureja was attacked on Monday night

RAJKOT: Initially suspected and registered as a murder , the death of a 64-year-old man in Gir-Somnath’s Talala taluka , has turned out to be a result of a brutal attack by a leopard.

The body of Laxmidas Sureja, a retired school teacher, was found in a pool of blood on Virpur-Dhava road at around 10:45pm on Monday by his family members. Sureja had gone to his mango orchard with some labourers and was returning home after completion of work. However, as he did not come till late, his relatives started searching for him.

They called the the local police suspecting that someone had killed him and the cops registered a case of murder. The body was sent for postmortem to Talala government hospital where doctors informed at around 2am that the injuries were inflicted by some wild animal. The police then informed the forest department for further investigation.

Sureja was returning home on foot from the orchard.

Talking to TOI, Dheeraj Mittal, deputy conservator of forest, Gir (west) division said, “There was no eyewitness of the incident and being the rainy season, pug marks were also not clearly seen. But looking at injury marks, we strongly suspect that he was attacked by a leopard. It's difficult to say why the leopard attacked him.”

According to forest officials, leopards generally don’t attack adults, so there is a possibility that a wild cat and the victim could have accidentally come closer.

229,['29/07/2020'],Missing Vakataka coin probe gets boost as ex-HoD’s handwriting on ‘receipt’ confirmed,"Nagpur: The Vakataka coin theft case of Nagpur University, almost in cold storage, seems to have got a boost as the handwriting department of State Criminal Investigation Department (CID) confirmed the handwriting on a crucial document to be that of an ex-head of the department (HoD) who was already under scanner.

Around 224 Vakataka-Vishukundin era coins had mysteriously gone missing along with 2,633 other artefacts from the museum of the Department of Ancient Indian History, Culture and Archaeology of the university.

The coins and artefacts, registered as ‘antiquities’, are learnt to be worth crores of rupees in international market. The coins, made out of gold, silver and bronze, were handed over to the university in 1967 by a Paoner-based farmer, Deshmukh, who had found them while farming his land.

TOI was the first to report about the missing coins and related irregularities of the department, including the unavailability of a ‘fact-finding report’ about the glitches, in March 2016. After much delay, university lodged a complaint with Ambazari police in March 2017 following which a case of theft was registered.

Sources in the police department said a scholar and photographer had obtained signature of the ex-HoD on a piece of paper while handing over the coins to him after her purpose was served with them. She had kept the ‘receipt’ with herself as proof of handing over the coins to the then HoD.

After the controversy over the missing coins led to a police probe, the woman handed over the receipt to the investigating team stating it was the proof of her handing over the coins to the HoD.

Ambazari police, which too went slow on the case, had sent the receipt for handwriting verification to the State CID’s special wing in Pune. “We had sent a letter to the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) for valuation. It had replied it could not estimate the value without the coins and also wanted police to refer the case to the state wing of ASI,” said an officer of Ambazari police station.

“Once we get a reply regarding the valuation of the coins, we know whom to arrest and recover the coins as the handwriting specimen has already confirmed the suspect,” he said. He could not explain why action could not be taken without valuation report.

It is learnt former HoD Preeti Trivedi was first to raise an alarm about missing in 2014 while taking charge of the department from her predecessor. She had alerted the then divisional commissioner Anoop Kumar who was also holding the additional charge of the vice-chancellor. A fact-finding committee was formed under Kumar. Its report, prepared and presented in July 2014, too had gone missing.

The party is also angry over district guardian minister Nitin Raut not taking it into confidence while forming a panel to decide on lockdown policy for the city, The decision on lockdown will be taken by the administrative officers and their committee, guardian minister Nitin Raut announced on July 27 after chairing a meeting at divisional commissionerate.

In a statement, ruling party leader in NMC Sandip Jadhav said lockdown would cause huge losses to daily wagers. “We all are against lockdown. The guardian minister is indulging in dirty politics,” said Jadhav.

Mayor Sandip Joshi on Tuesday also cancelled his three-day programme to create awareness about Covid-19 guidelines.

As the debate continues on whether to reimpose complete lockdown with curfew or not, Joshi took the initiative and organised a meeting of MPs, MLAs, corporators and officials to discuss the issue on July 24. Joshi expressed concern over Raut’s decision as the former had skipped the meeting that focused on public awareness rather than lockdown.

“Raut’s role on all these issues is a violation of the rights of people's representatives,” Jadhav said, “The two-day janata curfew on July 25 and 26 received good support from the public indicating they do not want a prolonged lockdown.”

He said talks of another lockdown had created terror among Nagpurians. Citizens who were already troubled by the three-month lockdown do not want it again. If there is no need for lockdown again, then citizens, traders should follow the rules, there should be public awareness. “Raut misled everyone by making an uncalled-for statement,” Jadhav said.

Congress MLA and city president Vikas Thakre already told TOI a 15-day lockdown would affect common people the most. “If a complete lockdown is to be enforced, the administration should then ensure all citizens have food to eat,” he has said.

Only then we can decide on setting up a Trust or hammer out our future course of action. Nothing has been decided yet.”Residents of this Muslim-dominated village are battling the pandemic and are interned in their homes. Enthusiasm over construction of the mosque has ebbed with time, unlike the jubilation that swept the village one-and-half years ago as reported by TOI on February 7, 2019. “It would have been better, the waqf board considers building a hospital here so that we get better medical facilities. Coronavirus has hit us hard,” said Shadaab, a villager.After the apex court mandated allotment five acres to Sunni Central Waqf Board at a ‘prominent place’ in Ayodhya in its 2019 verdict, the Uttar Pradesh government allocated 5acre at Dhannipur village behind Raunahi police station of the district.Talking to TOI, Dhannipur village pradhan Rakesh Yadav said, “The joy has fizzled out. The village wears a deserted look and residents only discuss coronavirus and their financial future. Nobody wants to talk about the mosque. Their reactions are muted and most have lost interest.

The government must hold fresh elections and constitute a new board. The board’s term was extended as it had earlier accepted 5acre land in Dhannipur and was ready to constitute a committee to build the mosque.”",lucknow,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-77230669,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-112950,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/amidst-mandir-euphoria-no-talk-of-alternate-masjid/articleshow/77230670.cms

“More than 500 students from the tribal settlements would be affected because of the state government’s decision to provide education through online classes and television. The settlements do not have electricity connections and the families can not afford to purchase a smartphone,” said VS Paramasivam, district president of Tamil Nadu tribal people welfare association.

Instead, he said, the government should take necessary steps to deploy teachers for the welfare of the students. “It would be more than sufficient if the government appoints a couple of teachers for every four to five settlements in each forest range and classes could be conducted at the nearby government school at least for a half a day. Similar method could be adopted for the settlements in plain region,” he said.

He also urged the government to take steps to provide meal twice a day to the students and to arrange transportation facilities for them as the bus services are halted in the wake of increasing number of Covid-19 cases in the district.

This is the only way that these tribal children can be provided with education and the government could ensure social distancing norms and other guidelines to contain the spread of the virus, he said and added that a policy level decision should be taken to appoint teachers for the tribal students across the state.

Bhatia had issued a similar circular in January, when the number of cases of illegal moneylenders harassing people was increasing.

According to Anandnagar police, Tibrewal suffered heavy losses during the lockdown and had borrowed Rs 20 lakhs from Omprakash Punjabi, at 5% monthly interest. As he could not cope with the high interest rate, he killed himself on July 23.

The circular says that such elements are exploiting the current situation and lending money at high interest rates and recovering more money than they are owed. Sometimes, they illegally snatch property of the borrower and a law to prevent this, the Gujarat Money Lenders Act 2011, is in place.

Police officers who do not act against such illegal moneylenders in a timely fashion will subject to strict departmental action.

NEW DELHI: Delhi high court on Tuesday questioned Delhi University on its lack of preparedness and facilities for the differently abled students to enable them to appear in the open book examinations for final-year undergraduate courses. The court also wanted to know how many students in the Persons with Disabilities (PwD) category have applied to take exams through common service centres.

However, the university was unable to respond to the query and sought time to get the details.

“This is how you are concerned for the career of PwD students? We are aware that the challenge to UGC guidelines is before the Supreme Court. But we will surely ask questions about your preparedness for the exams,” a bench of justices Hima Kohli and Subramonium Prasad said while hearing two petitions by a law student and National Federation of Blind. The pleas sought effective mechanisms for visually impaired and specially-abled students so that they can get online education properly during the Covid-19 pandemic.

“I am sure DU is aware of the fact that the career of students is at stake, how can you be so slow,” justice Kohli wondered.

The bench further sought to know if the claim of petitioners that PwD students are not being given reading material, assistant devices and writing scribes, is true. Despite directions, DU has not filed its affidavit in the matter yet, it added.

“It is important for us to know that if the students who have asked for scribes will be able to interact with them two days before the exams?,” the bench said while noting the submission of senior advocate Kapil Sibal, who appeared for the law student, that scribe must be given to the student before the exams to know the suitability.

The high court then asked the representative of CSE Academy, which will help the varsity in conducting the exams, to be present before it on July 30, to know how many CSE centres across the country are situated in metropolitan and rural areas.Senior advocate RS Rhungta, appearing for National Federation of Blind, said around 200 visually challenged students did not participate in the mock tests as reading material was not provided to them.

One of the college principals said they were not able to provide scribe as it was not possible to give scribe during the pandemic time without knowing the health status of the student, he added.

“All three have been booked for harassment, issuing threats and under the Money Lenders Act,” said Osura.

About three years ago, they took a total loan of Rs 25 lakh — Rs 15 lakh from Krishna Finance, Rs 6 lakh from Indrajeet and Rs 4 lakh from Gaurav — for expanding their business. The were paying monthly interest of 3-5% to the money lenders, said police.

However, in 2019 the brothers faced financial losses and could not pay the monthly instalments. In his complaint, Abed stated that they started getting threats from the accused from September last year.

After that the brothers shifted to Indore, their native place. But the accused began to harass their relative Hozefa who lived in Rajkot. Abed said that even Hozefa had to shift to other city because of the constant harassment by the accused.

About 15 days back, the two brother returned to Gujarat and were staying at their in-laws’ house in Jamnagar city. The accused, somehow, got information and started threatening them.

The duo then decided to make representation to the Rajkot police commissioner and reached his office with their wives on Monday. But before making any complaint, the two brothers drank some poisonous substance and collapsed.

They were shifted to the civil hospital, where based on their statement a complaint was lodged against the three money lenders.

239,['29/07/2020'],"Row over height: MP, mayor visit Ghazipur landfill site","Gautam Gambhir said four more trommel machines will be added

NEW DELHI: Following controversies over East Delhi Municipal Corporation’s claims of reducing the height of the Ghazipur landfill by 40 feet, East Delhi MP Gautam Gambhir and mayor Nirmal Jain inspected the site on Tuesday and found reduction in heights in different stretches.

They were accompanied by local resident welfare association (RWA) members. One of them, Vinod K Nair, president of Pocket D SFS Flats RWA in Mayur Vihar-III , said the corporation and the MP had definitely taken steps to reduce the height. “We could see eight trommel machines for processing legacy waste and the height of landfill has come down by more than 33ft,” said Nair.

Gambhir said during the visit that it was the legacy waste of various governments for over 20 years. “I will still try to reduce the height as much as possible during my tenure because it was my priority from Day 1 and we all will have to work together to get rid of this disgusting nightmare,” he said.

The exercise started last October with one trommel machine-cum-ballistic separator to segregate solid waste and inert materials, the MP said, adding that plans were afoot to get four more machines.

Residents, however, pointed out that these machines couldn’t process fresh garbage while it would take three-four years to complete the processing of old degraded garbage. They have submitted their objections to the corporation.

“The fresh dump is growing on the rear side of the landfill and its height will automatically increase in four years. So chances are that we have to face the same situation if no timely action is taken. Residential colonies also need to transport minimum waste to the landfill,” said Nair.

The landfill has approximately 140 lakh tonnes of waste and the corporation claims to have processed 1.3 lakh tonne legacy waste. TOI found three sets of machines — two with three trommels each and another with two trommels.

Corporation commissioner Dilraj Kaur, who was also present, said, “The eight trommel machines are processing 1,500 metric tonnes of waste daily. After segregation, some waste go to waste-to-energy plants and some to the construction and demolition plant in Shastri Park . The remaining inert material is sent to parks, NTPC plants and other places.”

Kaur assured that there would be no increase in height again as fresh waste was not being dumped over existing mounds.

AAP legislator Kuldeep Kumar, however, claimed on Tuesday, “No work was done in the past one year, and the width of the landfill has increased.” The internal road of the landfill, which was just 10 feet in diameter, has become 30 feet due to the excessive garbage dumping, he alleged. “This is causing havoc for the people of the B block area near the landfill site,” Kumar claimed.

PATNA: Several rivers in north Bihar showed a rising trend following fresh showers as over 5 lakh more people were affected by the floods on Tuesday. According to state disaster management department (DMD), the population affected by floods surged from 24.43 lakh on Monday to 29.62 lakh in 12 districts till Tuesday evening.

The water resources department WRD bulletin said most rivers in north Bihar, except Bhutahi Balan and Lalbakeya , were flowing above danger level at many places. Bagmati and Adhwara group of rivers were also flowing above the corresponding danger level at 11 flood gauges in Sitamarhi, Sheohar, Madhubani, Darbhanga and Muzaffarpur districts.

Burhi Gandak was flowing above the danger level at all four flood gauges in Muzaffarpur, Samastipur and Khagaria districts. Kamla Balan was also above danger level at both flood gauges in Madhubani district.

A DMD bulletin stated that 2.62 lakh people have been evacuated to safer places and 22,997 persons were staying in relief camps and 4.19 lakh people were being provided with meal twice a day at 808 community kitchens.

WRD minister Sanjay Kumar Jha said Gandak, Burhi Gandak and Bagmati rivers remained turbulent. “There has been moderate to heavy rainfall in the catchment area of Gandak in the last 24 hours,” Jha told TOI.

He said 2.27 lakh cusecs were discharged in the Gandak through Valmikinagar barrage as on Tuesday evening and it was showing a falling trend.

The Patna Meteorological Centre said light to moderate rainfall occurred at a few places over north-central and south Bihar, many places over north-west part and most places over northeast parts of the state during the last 24 hours. Also, heavy rainfall occurred at one or two places over north Bihar.

DMD sources said airdropping of food packets by three Indian Air Force choppers continued while 18 teams of National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) and nine teams of State Disaster Response Force (SDRF) were involved in rescue and relief operations.

DGP Shivanand Jha said such awards are also given in paramilitary forces like the Border Security Force (BSF) and Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF).

Jha said personnel from all ranks have worked as frontline warrior against Covid-19. “To motivate them, with the approval of the government, the awards were handed over to 110 personnel and including 13 IPS officers,” Jha said.

So far, medals were only awarded to police officers by the President of India and were few and far between. “A lot of personnel who had done good work could not be accommodated. To motivate such personnel, Jha had sent a proposal to the government and the state home department approved the DGP’s Commendation Disc award.

Dua’s south Delhi-based firm, which deals in all kinds of financial products and is primarily a distributor of bonds, has a vacancy for two computer operators for a monthly salary of Rs 16,000 each. Dua has posted about these openings on Delhi government’s new job portal, jobs.delhi.gov.in. “The response is just huge and my phone is now connected to a charger or power bank 24x7 as I’m unable to receive all calls or reply to the messages,” he said.

Rozgar Bazaar was launched by chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Monday to bridge the gap between job seekers and employers and help revive the economy. Till 6.50pm on Wednesday, 2,89,643 job seekers have registered on the portal and 6,766 recruiters have posted about more than one lakh openings under 32 categories.

Highest number of job seekers — 1,04,086 — want back office and data entry jobs. There are 41,990 others who are looking for customer care and telecaller jobs, while 26,211 IT, hardware and network engineers have also applied.

The largest number of openings, 1,17,576, are for sales, marketing and business development jobs, while it has 43,080 job seekers. The other top categories for job seekers include educational (46,474), accounts (37,830), human resources and office administration (31,989), warehouse and logistical support (30,805), reception (30,619) and delivery services (24,503).

Among the top categories of jobs available after sales, marketing and business development are customer care and telecalling (17,913), human resources and administration (9,548), driving (8,224), education (8,114), beauty parlours, spas and wellness activities (7,073), accountancy (6,107), peons (6,088), delivery services (4,885) and construction (4,358).

Job providers are, however, wondering how to select candidates. “We need an accountant and are willing to pay a salary of up to Rs 20,000 a month. I have received hundreds of calls and asked everyone to mail us their resume but choosing one person from so many is difficult,” said the owner of a Rohini-based firm.

“With the number of calls I am getting from those outside Delhi-NCR, I need to hire a person just to attend to calls,” said Vineet Agarwal, who needs 50 construction workers for a project in the capital. “There is a huge shortage of workers in Delhi-NCR and the response has been huge. The problem is workers with all levels of skill sets are calling constantly though our requirement is particular,” he said. “The initiative is good but employers should get more space to put specific requirements,” Agarwal pointed out.

Not everyone needs highly qualified workers or many of them. Hemant Singhal, a resident of Vashisht Park near Janakpuri, needs to add a floor to his house but can’t find skilled masons for the past four months. “A few who were available were asking for a fortune. After I posted on the portal, many skilled masons have called and they are willing to work according to my budget,” he added.

“Kodiyeri is trying to incite communalism, but it will not have any impact. The public have no doubt about my secular credentials. Kodiyeri should not force me to reveal more about his credentials. He knows well about the various aspects of gold smuggling and its implications. Therefore, he is trying to divert attention,” said Ramesh. Kodiyeri had recently said that BJP wanted Chennithala to head the UDF, replacing former chief minister Oommen Chandy and P K Kunhalikutty.

Consultancy for Sabarimala airport

Chennithala flayed the appointment of Louis Berger , a US-headquartered global professional services firm, as the consultant for the proposed Sabarimala greenfield airport, violating norms and pointed out that chief minister’s office (CMO) is using consultancy to indulge in corruption.

Louis Berger was appointed as consultant in 2017, even before the government finalized the site for the airport. How can a government appoint a consultant even before the site for the airport is identified? he asked.

While the government is now proposing Cheruvally Estate in Erumely as the site of the airport, representatives of Louis Berger couldn’t even enter the land, he said.

Chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan while replying to the allegations levelled by the opposition leader said the consultant was appointed to conduct a feasibility study for the proposed airport project at the Cheruvally estate. “There is no need for waiting till the legal dispute of ownership of the land is over to conduct the feasibility study. The government is sure of getting the ownership and hence went ahead with the appointment of the consultant. Those against the airport project are coming out with such baseless allegations,” Vijayan said.

JAIPUR: Adamant about its stand on convening the Rajasthan assembly session from July 31, the Ashok Gehlot government on Tuesday sent yet another proposal — its third since July 23 — to governor Kalraj Mishra , who a day earlier had advised the government to follow three points, including serving a 21-day notice to legislators before calling the session.

Parliamentary affairs minister Shanti Dhariwal told TOI, “There is no rule binding on us to serve a 21-day notice for calling sessions, which have been convened on much shorter notices on several occasions in the past.”

The embattled Congress government’s fresh proposal does not talk about a trust vote — TOI reported on Tuesday that the cabinet wouldn’t commit itself to one — saying that setting an agenda for the House is the right of the assembly’s business advisory committee (BAC). On Monday, Mishra mentioned that seeking a trust vote could justify convening the assembly at a short notice.

On the governor’s third advice — making safety arrangements to counter the Covid-19 risk in the House — the government responded that managing the affairs of the Vidhan Sabha was the prerogative of the Speaker. Asked if the cabinet has mentioned the trust vote in the revised proposal, Dhariwal said: “The House agenda is decided by the BAC. We want to discuss the state’s Covid-19 and financial conditions. Other issues could be taken up if the BAC approves.”

After a nearly two-hour long cabinet meeting, revenue minister Harish Chaudhary said: “The governor should let the cabinet’s rights remain with the cabinet, the speaker’s right to remain with the speaker and perform his own duty.”

Transport minister Pratap Singh Khachariyawas said, “We have sought the assembly session from July 31 as recommended by the cabinet earlier also.”

On the Governor returning the cabinet recommendations twice between July 24 and 27, transport minister Pratap Singh Khachariyawas said: “If the President denies Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s call for convening a Lok Sabha session, can the nation function? We do not want a confrontation with the Governor, who is the head of our family. But, Article 163 clearly states that a Governor cannot reject the cabinet proposal.”

“Entire BJP is functioning like slaves of the Congress rebels ( Sachin Pilot camp ). The Assembly session will not be convened if these rebels tell the BJP not to do so. Politics is being done ignoring the constitution,” said Kachariyawas, accusing the BJP of trying to topple the Congress government.

AICC general secretary in-charge of Rajasthan, Avinash Pande took to Twitter to question the Governor’s decision. In a series of tweets with hashtag #GetWellSoonGovernor, Pande wrote, “The Governor is adopting a partial attitude to fulfil the interests of a particular party.”

Mishra returned the cabinet’s first recommendation while raising six queries on July 24 and the second recommendation while asking government response on the 3-point advice from him on July 27.

245,['29/07/2020'],Rain in Delhi: Expect heavy rain on Wednesday and Thursday in Delhi,"Representative image

NEW DELHI: India Meteorological Department has issued an orange alert for the capital for the next two days, forecasting moderate to heavy rain for Wednesday and Thursday. While most areas are expected to record moderate showers, isolated spots in NCR may receive heavy rainfall — exceeding 65mm in a 24-hour period.

IMD’s impact-based forecast has suggested that people check for traffic congestion as waterlogging is likely to occur.

Kuldeep Srivastava, IMD scientist and head of the Regional Weather Forecasting Centre in Delhi, said the monsoon trough that was running close to the foothills of the Himalayas has moved. It is now passing through Delhi-NCR, which is likely to increase the intensity of rain.

“There is a combination of factors at play. Along with the monsoon trough, south-westerly winds from Arabian Sea and Bay of Bengal are approaching Haryana, NCR, west Uttar Pradesh and northeast Rajasthan. Under the influence of these systems, heavy to very heavy rain may occur over these areas,” said Srivastava.

IMD classifies rainfall recorded between 2.5 and 15.5mm as ‘light’, between 15.6mm and 64.4mm as ‘moderate’, between 64.5 and 115.5mm as ‘heavy’ and beyond 115.6mm in a 24-hour period as ‘very heavy’.

Delhi has already received excess rain at Safdarjung, Palam and Lodhi Road stations for the month of July. However, the city has an overall 24% deficit so far this season. Met officials said that the spell of rain in the next two days could change that situation.

The maximum temperature on Tuesday was 37.5 degrees — three notches above the normal for this time of the season and the minimum was 28.7 degrees Celsius, with the humidity levels oscillating between 61% and 95%. Forecast for Wednesday shows moderate to heavy showers with the maximum and minimum likely to hover around 35 and 26 degrees Celsius, respectively.

249,['29/07/2020'],"In Sunderbans, tiger scores big, so does its prey: Study","KOLKATA: The detailed report on ‘Tigers, Co-predators and Prey in India’, released in New Delhi on Tuesday, reveals that wild pig and spotted deer — the main prey species of tigers in the Indian Sunderbans — are widely distributed in the landscape, with both of them turning out to be the most common species of the mangroves . Palm civet and estuarine crocodile are the rarest to be clicked. Occupancy of tigers across the landscape is almost 100%.

This, according to experts, points to a good habitat. While spotted deer was captured throughout the landscape with highest concentration of photo-captures in Sajnekhali Wildlife Sanctuary, wild pig was also found to be distributed throughout the Sunderbans with highest concentration of photographs in the biosphere reserve area — the buffer zone. As per the report, Indian Sunderbans is home to 88 tigers.

Of the two other prey species — rhesus macaque and monitor lizard — both have highest concentration in Sajnekhali sanctuary area. Interestingly, tiger density was also found to be high in this zone. West range of tiger reserve and parts of biosphere reserve, too, have high tiger density.

Estuarine crocodile was one of the rarest species to be photo-captured. “But, one should keep in mind that camera traps are not the most ideal equipment to evaluate this semi-aquatic reptile’s distribution,” said the report. Palm civet, too, was captured only at the edges of the buffer zone of Basirhat range.

While cameras clicked about 10 and 19 photographs of deer and wild pigs , respectively, per 100 trap nights, they failed to capture a single saltwater crocodile and palm civet over the same duration. A trap night is one trap set for one night. Number of tiger photos per 100 trap nights is three.

Golden jackal was captured for the first time in the tiger reserve area and it seems to be a “recent colonizer” restricted to the mangrove forest edges of Sajnekhali sanctuary and islands of the biosphere reserve adjacent to human settlements.

Among the other key species, leopard cats and fishing cats were clicked throughout the landscape. Otters were primarily clicked in the core zone of the forest and beside wide river channels.

According to Y V Jhala of Wildlife Institute of India, one of the co-authors of the report, within Sunderbans tiger population, low to medium level of genetic diversity has been reported. “The primary concern regarding threats to genetic heterogeneity of this population is the probable isolation induced by wide rivers. Earlier reports found that tigers rarely crossed channels wider than 400m. There are reports of fine-scale genetic structure and clustering within the tiger population of Bangladesh Sunderbans that could largely be attributed to river systems. Though tigers have been observed to occasionally disperse across wide rivers, increased continuous use of water channels inside forest as conduit for commercial boat traffic can transform the rivers to barriers to tiger movement,” he said.

250,['29/07/2020'],10 free Covid ambulances to be deployed across city,"Nagpur: A day after Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) permitted home isolation of asymptomatic Covid patients, it has decided to deploy one ambulance each in all 10 zones in the city. For this purpose, the civic body has hired private ambulances. The civic body will also deploy 10 Aapli buses at the zonal level, revealed a senior official on Tuesday.

According to the official, these ambulances, manned by paramedical staff, will have basic first aid facilities and will be under the control of zonal medical officers of NMC.

At present, NMC is using its seven ambulances to ferry suspected cases to hospitals and quarantine centres. Of the 11 ambulances of Maharashtra government’s 108 Service, the civic body is using four to ferry only Covid-19 patients.

In May, the civic body had converted three of its mini buses into ambulances with basic first aid kits. These buses were being used to shift people from containment zones to quarantine centres.

“After allowing asymptomatic patients to stay at home, it was the NMC’s responsibility to monitor their health,” said the official. These ambulances along with paramedical staff will be available at every zone’s office round-the-clock for extending emergency relief to Covid patients.

“In case of emergency, the asymptomatic patients can contact the NMC’s control room and get quicker medical help. If needed, these ambulances will also shift serious patients to either Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH) or Indira Gandhi Government Medical College and Hospital (IGGMCH) whichever is closer,” he explained.

The officer said these ambulances will be available 24X7. The rates, to be paid by NMC, have been fixed by the regional transport authority headed by district collector Ravindra Thakare and regional transport office staff as members.

The ambulances were hired along with drivers and fuel expenditure. As per the RTA’s decision and civic chief’s nod, the NMC will pay Rs1,900 per day for each ambulance. The NMC, however, will provide the service free of cost to home quarantined Covid-19 patients.

254,['29/07/2020'],‘Shocked’ accused moves HC against unhygienic conditions inside temporary jail,"Nagpur: A “shocked and surprised” accused moved the Nagpur bench of Bombay high court exposing unhygienic conditions inside the temporary jail set up at Mount Carmel High School at Ajni Square, warning that there’s every chance of 250 inmates getting infected with Covid-19 virus.

Petitioner Sunil Meshram, who was released on bail on July 12, claimed that no social distancing was maintained by either the inmates or officials and even masks are a rarity. He prayed for immediately implementing of ‘Maharashtra Prisons Manual’ provisions and guidelines issued for dealing with the coronavirus by the government and WHO.

A division bench comprising justices Ravi Deshpande and Nitin Suryawanshi while issuing notices to respondents — State Department of Home secretary, DGP (Prisons), and Central Jail Superintendent — kept the case for disposal after eight weeks.

The 48-year-old accused, through counsel Rajnish Vyas, highlighted respondents inaction in providing proper facilities to the petitioners as per ‘Maharashtra prisons (Prison, Building and Sanitary Arrangement) Rule, 1954’. Several guidelines are framed, including cleaning the barracks, ventilation in sleeping ward and cleaning of latrines and urinals, under it.

According to him, over 250 jailbirds were being kept at the temporary facility in a highly congested manner. “If one stretches his arm, it may touch two other inmates. A majority of them and officials roam freely in the facility without masks. No soap or sanitizer was provided while the drinking water is made available in a blue plastic drum without cover and all inmates use only one jar.”

Claiming that only two toilets were made available for all of them, Meshram said they were made to wait in a queue for five to six hours for using them. “The conditions of toilets are worst and there’s every chance of getting infected with Covid-19 or any other infection. The inmates were not allowed to carry clothes inside for bathing which forced them to wear the same set. Even sanitization of bed was not carried out regularly and it’s kept at such a place where no sunlight reaches.”

Narrating the inmates’ plight inside the temporary jail, the petitioner claimed that no testing was conducted on him while entering the premises and even after securing bail. “Neither any medical examination was held, nor any doctor was made available. It’s a sheer violation of Article 21 of the Constitution of India and also our human rights. Not only was human dignity crushed, but also violated by the jail authorities. After the outbreak in jail over 300 inmates and jail officials were infected. Still, the officials are reluctant to sanitize the premises,” he said.

In a post on his Facebook page on Tuesday, Balakrishnan claimed that IUML and Jamaat share the same position on the issue. Thangal wrote an article in Chandrika daily on July 24 welcoming Turkey President Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s act of converting Hagia Sophia into a mosque.

“The ruler in Turkey converted Hagia Sophia museum into a mosque and IUML leader Sadiq Ali Thangal wrote an article justifying the act. Jamaat-e-Islami is an organization that supports Turkey government’s stand unconditionally. The tie-up between IUML and the Jamaat has become clear to the public after the IUML leader wrote the article from Jamaat’s point of view,” he alleged.

The CPM leader added that both organizations have reached an ideological agreement. Congress and IUML have decided to have a coalition with SDPI and the Jamaat.

Kodiyeri wanted to know the stand of the Congress leadership on Hagia Sophia issue.

Balakrishnan said how could IUML, that spoke against BJP government’s stand on demolishing Babri Masjid and constructing Ram temple at the site, justify the Hagia Sophia issue. “We would like to know the UDF leadership’s stand on these questions,” he said.

This is not the first time CPM is raising the issue of Jamaat-IUML tie-up. The party is keen to capitalize the discontent that exists among some Muslim organizations against the alliance.

The managements said that many teachers are switching to other professions to earn a livelihood and added that it would be hard to get them back at a later stage. They said that parents should cooperate with managements and pay dues to stop teachers from moving out of the teaching field as it will directly affect students in the long run.

They also asked the parents to cooperate and make arrangements for their children to attend online classes as there is no other alternative to continue classes in the current situation.

As many as 1.15 lakh complaints regarding water supply and 78,638 sewerage-related grievances were registered.“More than 56% of the civic complaints came from the five zones, which had the highest Covid-19 containment zones. Three out of the top five zones with highest containment zones also reported most water supply and solid waste management complaints,” the report states.About 55% of the garbage-related complaints, 58% of the toilet/sanitation complaints and 57% of the sewerage-related complaints had come from these five zones.Delhi has a total of 12 municipal corporation administrative zones--EDMC has two zones, SDMC hosts four and the north municipal corporation is divided into six administrative zones.According to Praja Foundation, with the entire world battling the Covid-19 pandemic, water, sanitation and hygiene have gained immense importance in the prevention of the disease. “Multiple agencies and governments in Delhi still grapple with providing basic civic services that are key determinants of health. Delhi has a long way to go in ensuring adequate, equitable and sustainable water, sanitation and solid waste management facilities, which have a direct bearing on health. Precautions to maintain hygiene do not hold valid when adequate water, sanitation and waste management facilities are not available to all,” the report states.The study also highlights that only one in four public toilets is available for females and only 5% of the city's public toilet infrastructure for handicapped people.According to the data available, maximum number of complaints made with corporations in 2019 were related to buildings (59,896), solid waste management (23,555) and nuisance due to stray dogs and monkeys (19,013).

262,['29/07/2020'],"In lockdown, WFH testing limits of mind and body","Bhubaneswar: It has been almost five months that Covid-19 and the subsequent lockdown to contain the virus have forced many in private and government offices to work from home.

But maintaining a balance between office and household work, stuck within the confines of the four walls, is putting a great demand on the mind space of professionals, leading to burnout, fatigue and mental health issues.

Complaints of stress, anxiety, fatigue, insomnia as well as physical problems like backache, headache, migraine and tiredness have reached alarming proportions and many are forced to dial the doctor.

For professionals, work from home ( WFH ) has led to a new culture of online meetings, webinars and training modules.

“There is something or the other every day, lasting from 45 minutes to 2 hours. Sometimes, they all get bunched up together on a single day, putting great stress on mind and body. Sometimes, it is not even remotely related to work, but the management asks you to participate. All this is beyond my routine work for which I am answerable. Honestly, it’s draining. Also, you need to be attentive all the time,” Sangeeta Sahoo, an IT professional.

Many are complaining of exhaustion and say WFH is testing their nerves. “Recently, I got caught in a peculiar situation during a meeting. I got a call from a client and while I was discussing that, a senior sought my opinion during the office meeting. I had no clue what the question was and barely managed to save face saying there was problem with my internet connection,” said Himanshu Mohapatra, a SAP executive.

For married women with children, it is a roller-coaster ride managing office work and household chores in the absence of maid and cook. “I have not only lost my mental peace, but I am facing health complications. So much screen time is affecting my vision and sitting for long hours has led to pain in my spinal cord and neck,” said Moumita Dey, a consultant in a private firm. And then there are the children. “Managing their tantrums gives me headache at times,” she added.

Professionals alleged that the workload has increased substantially because managers generally overlook office timings and expect you to work at any time of the day. “It seems there is no break as the weekend seems same as the workdays. And unless you fall ill, there seems to be no other reason to seek leave,” said Subhashree Panda, a teacher who has to take three to four online classes every day.

Psychiatrists said they are getting distress calls from patients with complaints of anxiety, stress and sleep disorder triggered due to work from home. “The number of patients with stress-related issues has increased. WFH without the team causes lack of motivation and with family around, people cannot concentrate either, which affects their self-confidence. People work had but due to the fear of job loss, there is a sense of insecurity,” said Subhendu Narayan Mishra, consultant psychiatrist at IMS and SUM Hospital.

Experts suggested a series of minor initiatives can help in coping with the stress of WFH. “Regular routine like getting ready for the office, wearing office clothes and setting up a separate work area might help,” said Dr S K Padhy, additional professor of department of psychiatry at AIIMS, Bhubaneswar.

About managing household chores, Dr Padhy said, “Sort out roles with your spouse and make a balance between cooking, online classes of children and office work.” He also suggested yoga and meditation as well as staring away from the screen time and again to avoid putting stress on the eyes.

Under this scheme, those who have to pay property tax dues with interest need to pay just 10% of their accumulated interest along with principal amount up to 2019-2020 financial year.The scheme will be implemented in Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) along with all municipalities and municipal corporations in the state for 45 days from August 1. With this, within GHMC limits over five lakh properties will be benefited up to Rs 900 crore and another Rs 100 crore in rest of the state. The municipal corporation collects 2% interest on tax arrears if a tax payer fails to clear dues in the stipulated time. The GHMC sent a proposal through the standing committee and suggested the scheme can be implemented by invoking Section 679-E of the GHMC Act and a similar provision in the other urban local bodies.“The pending arrears and interests were due mainly because of disputes about improper assessment, vacancy of premises, dilapidated structures, dispute between family members,” GHMC commissioner informed the government. Interestingly, the GHMC proposed to collect 20% of the interest from the tax payers, but the municipal administration further reduced it to 10%.The government, while allowing a one-time amnesty said the waiver of interest would be applicable provided the tax payer clears the principle amount of property tax dues till 2019-2020 together with 10% of the accumulated interest at one go.

265,['29/07/2020'],Former sarpanch’s death triggers arson,"HYDERABAD: Two rival groups clashed over location of a cremation ground at Jaitram thanda in Utnoor mandal in Adilabad district late on Monday night. Due to the tense situation prevailing in the hamlet, a former sarpanch reportedly suffered a heart attack and died on the way to hospital. After his death, the groups resorted to arson and damaged property.

Two police constables were suspended, while one of them was taken into custody on Tuesday, for their role in triggering the clashes.

At least three houses and an equal number of bikes, a bullock cart, a tractor and a car were set ablaze by vandals during the violence on Monday night. Three fire engines were rushed to the village to put out the fires, even as there was resistance from villagers to allow them into the village.

A long-standing rivalry between families of the present sarpanch and the former sarpanch snowballed into a major issue reportedly involving supporters of Congress and TRS. Additional police forces have been rushed to the hamlet to prevent the situation going out of hand.

Trouble started on July 27 evening after an inspection was done to decide on the location of a cremation ground for the village amid Covid-19 spread. Differences between sarpanch Renuka ’s husband Rathod Parushuram of TRS and ex-sarpanch Anasuya ’s husband Rathod Gajanand, also a former sarpanch, of Congress came to the fore. Parushuram lodged a complaint with Utnoor police, who summoned 50-year-old Gajanand.

Two constables—Aade Sanjeev and Brahmanand, said to be related to Renuka — got involved and went to Gajanand’s house and created a ruckus. Gajanand reportedly suffered a heart stroke and died while being shifted to hospital. After his death, his followers clashed with their rivals and the two groups resorted to arson in the hamlet. Sanjeev and Brahmanand were suspended, leading to clashes. Later, Sanjeev was taken into custody. A post-mortem examination on the body of Gajanand was conducted on Tuesday. Later, his body was handed over to his kin for last rites.

266,['29/07/2020'],321 big cats utilizing four tiger reserves in TN,"Udhagamandalam: As per the updated report on India’s Tiger Survey from 2018, which was released on Tuesday, 321 tigers are utilizing the four tiger reserves such as Mudumalai Tiger Reserve (MTR), Sathyamangalam Tiger Reserve (STR), Anaimalai Tiger Reserve (ATR) and Kalakadu Mundanthurai Tiger Reserve (KMTR) in Tamil Nadu.

However, the number of tigers within the four reserves is estimated at 213, with MTR being the number one in tiger population in TN.

The survey - the fourth cycle of National tiger status assessment of 2018-19 – says India is home to 2,367 tigers. The survey was released by Union minister of environment, forest and climate change.

This is the first time that the survey has been updated accurately reserve-wise, based purely on camera traps.

While 162 tigers utilize the MTR, the reserve accounts for 103 big cats. The second dense tiger population reserve, STR accounts for 83 tigers while 126 big cats utilize the reserve. ATR and KMTR account for 20 and seven tigers respectively. While 25 big cats utilize ATR, eight tigers utilize KMTR.

“MTR which accounted for around 57 tigers in the 2014 census, now houses 103 big cats. This is the first time (2018), the buffer zone was taken into consideration for census. Of course, there is an increase of about 15% in tiger population in the reserve after the declaration of the buffer zone extending to an area of 365 sq km,” the field director of MTR, K Kaushal, said.

India has 2,967 tigers, at least 30 more than in 2014, according to results of a census made public by NTCA on July 29 last year. In the same result, Tamil Nadu’s tiger population was put at 264 tigers, an increase of 15% compared to 2014 assessment.

The present update is a more granular estimate of these numbers. “This is the first time, tiger survey data is being harmonized and it is refined reserve-wise,” said Srinivas R Reddy, a senior IFS officer and former field director, MTR.

According to him, MTR and STR are saturated when it comes to tiger population. ART and KMTR are having much scope for increase in tiger population.

All the four tiger reserves in Tamil Nadu have been ranked “very good” in the Management Effectiveness Evaluation (MEE) rating done for all the tiger reserves in India.

According to police, the accused Kamaal Khan Sandhi used the forged SEBC certificate to contest the by-election on an SEBC reserved seat in Karjan municipality in November 2015. Police said that Sandhi’s father Sumaar Khan had got the forged certificate and Sandhi despite knowing about it, used it for his candidature. The district administration initiated an inquiry after one Mehboob Khan Pathan complained.

Based on the complaint, the director of developing castes welfare formed a committee. The committee’s probe revealed that the records did not have Sumaar Khan’s data so he was asked to submit his certificate. The certificate was also found to be forged and the benefits that he and the family took were declared as illegal.

Police said that the executive magistrate of Karjan had directed the deputy executive magistrate to lodge a complaint in January last year. “As we received the complaint recently, we registered an offence on Monday,” said a police official. Preliminary investigation revealed that the two accused had made the fake certificate between July 2012 and January 2013.

Due to this, the cops booked them for causing negligence that may spread deadly virus along with charges of Epidemic Act and gambling act.

In another case registered with Kalol taluka police station, the cops were patrolling to monitor if norms of social distancing were being followed. At that time, they got an input that some persons had gathered at Saij village.

When the police reached there, they found that six persons, all from Saij village, were gambling. In this case also, the police booked them under the charges of Epidemic Act.

On the other hand, Pethapur police station officials of Gandhinagar district booked four persons for gambling but as they were wearing masks and had sanitization facility, they were not booked under the Epidemic Act.

Sambalpuri Bastralaya Handloom Cooperative Society, which had reported a turnover of around Rs 20 crore between March and June last year, has managed just around Rs 10.41 crore during the same period this year.Hemanta Kumar Mishra, the marketing officer of the handloom cooperative society, said there are around 40 outlets of Sambalpuri Bastralaya which had good business last year. “But this year, the outlets failed to make good business. The lockdown began on March 25 and the outlets were not allowed to open till May 3. When they were finally allowed to open, there were very few customers. And while the process to unlock the market has begun, the shutdown at many places has hurt business,” Mishra said.He said Sambalpuri saree and other fabrics are sold during the marriage season , besides during family functions. “However, several marriages were cancelled and events deferred due to the pandemic, affecting the sale of Sambalpuri handloom products,” he added.Mishra said the weavers of the cooperative societies are facing a tough time. “With the decrease in sales, we are not able to provide them with work order for sarees and other Sambalpuri handloom products. Earlier, the weavers, who are part of Sambalpuri Bastralaya Handloom Cooperative Society, were earning around Rs 16,000 per month. Now, with decrease in sales, they are barely making Rs 7,000/month,” said Mishra.More than 6000 weavers are part of Sambalpuri Bastralaya while at least 90 such societies across the state are engaged in marketing of the products.“Due the pandemic, the weavers across the state are going through a hard time. The markets across the country have either completely shut shop or are partially open, and as a result the sale of Sambalpuri saree, dress materials and bedsheet have been badly affected.

Krishnangar poilce sources said they registered an offence under Section 420, 406 and 114 against the accused. ACP G division A M Desai said both the accused have been detained and sent for pre-arrest Covid-19 tests.

Patel, who makes furniture, in his FIR stated four or five days ago, he learned that his neighbours Jayanti and Jaimini were enrolling people to get Rs 60,000 under a government scheme named Sukanya Samruddhi Yojana.

“He stated that they took Rs 800 from him for the form. They said he would have to pay them Rs 1,000 when the form was approved and Rs 13,000 when they got paid Rs 60,000,” said a police official.

The FIR states that on Sunday he saw a crowd, some media persons and policemen at his society. “He learned that Jayanti Patel and Jaimini had actually been cheating people in the name of this scheme and he was hence lodging a complaint,” a police official said.

Police sources said they suspect the accused cheated many people using this modus operandi. “Sukanya Samruddi Yojana is a small deposit scheme of the government of India meant exclusively for a girl child and is a part of the ‘Beti Bachao - Beti Padhao’ campaign .

It was the reason that the state government increased the amount of bond for UG and PG students from Rs 5 lakh and Rs 10 lakh to Rs 20 lakh and Rs 40 lakh respectively, while bringing down the time required for rural service from three years to one year.The notification mentions that the time served at Covid-19 will be considered at double the rate than the normal residentship – if the doctor serves for three months, it will be considered equivalent to six months of serving in rural areas. It will also have retrospective effect – if some doctors have not completed their service for some reason, they can complete it at designated Covid-19 hospitals.Dr Manjit Nayak, PG committee member of Ahmedabad Medical Association (AMA), said that dilution of the medical service rules will encourage more students to serve the Covid-19 positive patients in government hospitals in Gujarat. “Relaxing their bond service help the students reach their native places early to provide better healthcare services,” he said.The interested candidates will have to apply to the commissioner (health) office online or offline. Their service will be counted from the day they join the hospital and the certificate for time served will be issued by the medical superintendent of the respective hospital.Dr Pinkesh Rathwa, junior doctors association president at BJ Medical College, Ahmedabad, said that it is an encouraging step by the state government. “It will also lower the financial burden for the parents which will lead to more productivity.

276,['29/07/2020'],"Syllabus cut insufficient, improper: Academicians","Nagpur: Syllabus reduction approved by the state education department from Std I-XII by 25% has got a thumbs down from many academicians in the city. All agreed that the reduction plan erred on quantity as well as sequence.

Senior academician Anil Louis said cutting of syllabus by mere 25% is insufficient. “Consider the time lost. There are many schools which are yet to fully implement digital classes as both the institutions and parents are facing logistical and technical problems. Like CBSE, we should have gone with a 30% cut,” said Louis.

Ashok Gavhankar, senior principal and general secretary of Vidarbha Junior College Teachers Association (VJUCTA), said the biggest mistake was to reduce topics, not chapters. “After a cursory glance at the detailed PDF they sent us, I have noticed the number of pages they deleted from each chapter. They should have deleted entire chapters, not topics from every chapter,” said Gavhankar.

He added that the idea was to reduce workload for students due to time being lost in the current situation. “To give an example, the idea was to avoid the time a child spent at school. So government reduced two periods from daily schedule. But the child still has to go to school for six days a week, so has the load on child reduced,” he asked. Continuing with the same analogy, Gavhankar said, “The authorities should have kept the number of periods as before but reduced the school week by two days. That would have been actual load reduction.”

Another objection academicians have is about the sequence of chapter deletion. Ashnarayan Tiwari, principal of Adarsh Vidya Mandir (Gandhibagh) which produced top three HSC (commerce) students this year, said, “They (authorities) have reduced many topics starting from chapter I. But due to online classes, many schools and junior colleges have already finished chapter II also. So, this reduction has resulted in waste of efforts by teachers and students. They should have weeded out the last few chapters.”

279,['29/07/2020'],Covid Duty: Hotels Allowed To Check Out,"New Delhi: In a big relief to hotels, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Wednesday ordered the delinking of hotels from hospitals, earlier undertaken to enhance availability of beds for Covid-19 patients. The decision has been taken in view of hospitals not needing such hotel beds and the Covid situation improving in Delhi. The capital now has less than 11,000 active cases, with more than 88% of the patients having recovered.On Wednesday, Kejriwal tweeted, “Some hotels were attached to hospitals to increase the number of Covid beds. In view of the improving situation and all hotel beds lying vacant for the last many days, these hotels are now being released.”In early June, around 40 hotels, among them luxury hotels like Hyatt Regency and Pullman , were attached to various government and private hospitals to function as extended facilities of the medical institutions, enhancing the city’s availability of Covid beds by 4,600. The aim was to take pressure off the Covid-designated hospitals that could then provide more attention to critical corona patients.However, even at a time when Delhi reported nearly 4,000 new cases in a single day, many beds in government and private Covid centres remained vacant, leading the government to believe it could release the hotels from this responsibility without causing any strain on the Covid hospitals.After the number of Covid cases began increasing in early June, the government not only increased Covid beds in hospitals, but also requisitioned around three dozen hotels as secondary Covid centres. The government even won the case when some hotel owners went to court against the decision.However, since then, the beds in these hotels have never been needed. “With the efforts of the chief minister, the Covid condition in the capital has improved significantly. At present there are only around 11,000 active cases. Of the over 15,000 Covid beds, more than 12,000 are vacant,” a government official said.On July 4, the sub-divisional magistrate of Dwarka directed the delinking of three of the four hotels in the area after only 25 of the 900 rooms had been utilised.

280,['29/07/2020'],"Coaching insts decry lack of clarity on JEE, NEET syllabus","Nagpur: Now that Maharashtra government too has approved a reduction in syllabus following CBSE’s similar decision earlier, coaching institutes are fuming over lack of clarity from National Testing Agency (NTA).

Two of the biggest entrance exams in the country, Joint Entrance Examination (JEE-Mains) and National Entrance-cum-Eligibility Test (NEET) are conducted by NTA. Coaching institutes say it is shocking that no confirmation has come yet about the exams to be held in 2021.

Panini Telang, an academician who specializes in physics, said NTA must not delay this further. “Students, parents and academicians are all eagerly waiting to understand which parts of the original syllabus are to be studied,” said Telang.

Since preparation for competitive exams like JEE and NEET begin at least two years before, students are now in final phase for the exam to be conducted in 2021. “When I take up a topic for teaching to my students today, I have no idea whether or not it will feature in the exam next year. So it is possible we all are wasting our efforts,” said Telang.

Sameer Phale, an academician who specializes in biology/botany, said it was hard to even decipher why NTA is keeping quiet on this. “I do not understand why they ignore important issues related with students. Students preparing for NEET are clueless as to which part of the portion is still relevant,” said Phale.

These competitive exams are based on NCERT syllabus which is followed by CBSE. With the central board reducing its syllabus by 30%, the expectation is that it would apply to NTA too. However, no confirmation has yet come from the exam conducting body or the Ministry of Human Resources Development.

The decision to keep the shops and showrooms shut was taken to disrupt the spread of the novel coronavirus which has so far infected more than 1,000 people in Burrabazar, though locals feel several hundred cases may have gone unreported. Several people have even lost their lives to the virus.In the last two weeks, concerns within the business community have been apparent over the rising cases of Covid-19 which is not only keeping the markets deserted but also affecting their members.Arun Bhuwalka, president of Chamber of Textile Trade and Industry, apex body for textile trade and in eastern India, said the decision was taken after consulting all member associations who have assured that they will abide by the decision. “It is very important to be careful now because the virus is spreading rapidly and it has affected many people already. We feel our decision to keep our businesses shut for one week will go a long way in checking the spread of the virus in these pockets. We have also reached out to other markets in the area to work out a method in which they keep their establishments shut for a few days,” said Bhuwalka.The textile industry generates more than 10 million livelihoods directly and indirectly including traders, weavers, embroidery industry and transportation.There are close to 15,000 establishments engaged in the business of hosiery, garments and apparels in the textile hub. “Five to ten per cent very small traders may remain open to make their ends meet but close to 90% will abide by the decision taken by the apex body,” said Bhuwalka.West Bengal has historically been the hub of textile business in India for over a century catering to the needs of Bihar, Odisha, Assam, Jharkhand, Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh, covering more than 25% of India’s population. Kolkata has been the biggest trading centre for textiles in Eastern India with over half a million handloom weavers across the state.“The business is down by over 60% due to the pandemic, but we are still anticipating losses of over several crores due to the self-imposed lockdown, but safety of people is more important,” said Bhuwalka.",kolkata,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-77235778,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-53912,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/14k-traders-in-textile-hub-to-down-shutters-for-a-week/articleshow/77228852.cms

283,['29/07/2020'],Telangana worker jailed in Dubai for carrying banned drugs freed,"HYDERABAD: A Telangana worker who was jailed in Dubai for carrying banned medicines has been prematurely released and repatriated.

Of the seven-year jail term he was given, he completed three years and 10 months before social workers and Consulate General of India (CGI) took up his case.

Pusula Srinivas of Thadapakal village in Ergatla mandal of Nizamabad district went to Dubai on August 4, 2016 for a job. A person known to Srinivas came to his house four days prior to his leaving and left a packet with his wife saying that it contained tablets and Srinivas should carry it to Dubai and give it to someone they knew. Since he said it was medicine, Srinivas took it, but on landing in Dubai, he was arrested by the police as the tablets were banned substances in the country. Srinivas was convicted on February 22, 2017.

Gulf Telangana Welfare and Cultural Association president Patkuri Basant Reddy represented the matter to CGI, Dubai explaining the fact that it was not the intention of Srinivas to carry any banned medicines or substances. Krishna Donikeni, founder-president of Gulf Workers Awareness Centre (GWAC) in Dubai also helped Pusula Srinivas by approaching the court again to plead for his sentence to be reduced. Poosala Srinivas reached home on July 26 .

In 2017, IT minister K T Rama Rao, to whose notice the problem was brought by Donikeni, said the government was making efforts through the embassy to help Srinivas. Srinivas’ wife had also lodged a complaint with Morthad police on September 8, 2016 against one Mahesh who had handed over the packet to her when her husband was not home.

Addressing at the media point on the assembly premises on Tuesday, Prabhakar recalled that the Congress had demanded imposition of President’s rule in Telangana and section 8 in Greater Hyderabad not long ago. “The party is now adopting a different policy in Rajasthan where it is in power. Its government is literally threatening the governor if its demands are not met,” he said.

It may be recalled TPCC president N Uttam Kumar Reddy had sought implementation of section 8 of the AP Reorganisation Act giving control over certain buildings and affairs in Hyderabad to the governor.

Prabhakar said Congress leaders were breaking the Covid-19 guidelines and lockdown rules and trying to stage protests in the city without any valid reason. “Congress has a history of murdering democracy in the state right from NTR’s time and is now talking about democracy. BJP is adopting the same techniques used by Congress to bulldoze the elected governments,” he said.

Hyderabad: The state government is expecting to raise over Rs 800 crore through the auction of Rajiv Swagruha flats.

Knight Frank, real estate consultants of international repute, has been selected through bidding to evaluate the market price of the vacant 3,716 flats in Bandlaguda and Pocharam Rajiv Swagruha townships. The consultancy has also been asked to submit a report on the expected revenue if the flats are auctioned individually or to real estate giants in one or two lots. The report should be submitted within 10 days to the government.

Though the government has decided to auction the flats on “as is where is” basis i.e., without carrying out any further repairs or adding infrastructure to it, a final call will be taken by chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao after the report is submitted to him.

R&B minister Vemula Prashant Reddy said the guidelines for auction-cum-sale of Swagruha flats are being finalised. The prices for sale of flats would be fixed by taking into consideration its saleability in the open market. There are a total of 3,716 flats that are lying vacant in the townships at Bandlaguda and Pocharam.

In 2007, then-government in undivided AP had announced Rajiv Swagruha housing scheme for urban middle class. For this, Andhra Pradesh Rajiv Swagruha Corporation Limited (APRSCL) was established.

After Telangana state’s formation, APRSCL cleared bank loans and released all projects from mortgage. In 2016, the government decided to allot the flats at Bandlaguda and Pocharam to government staff, but there were hardly any takers.

Singh is looking after Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s important project of Kedarnath development plan and therefore, possibilities are high that he may be given an extension.

Among the other top four IAS officers who are being considered for the coveted post are — commerce secretary Anup Wadhawan, NHAI chairman Sukhbir Singh Sandhu, additional chief secretary Om Prakash, and additional chief secretary Radha Raturi.

Singh took over the charge of CS from S Ramaswamy on October 25, 2017. Born on July 29, 1960, Singh – who hails from Jharkhand – is the 15 CS of the Himalayan state.

In his tenure, Singh played a key role in monitoring the pace of projects at Kedarnath and also the Rs 12,000 crore All Weather Road for Char Dham project announced by PM Modi before the state elections of 2017. With both projects moving at a swift pace, possibilities are that Singh may be given an extension.

Commerce secretary Anup Wadhawan, who is presently at Central deputation, has served key positions in the state and is being regarded as one of the probables for the top post.

Sukhbir Singh Sandhu, who is presently NHAI chairman, had gone on Central deputation around six years back. He had worked in the state in the tenures of former chief ministers like BC Khanduri, Vijay Bahuguna, and Harish Rawat.

Additional chief secretary Om Prakash is also one of the probables as he is regarded close to state chief minister Trivendra Singh Rawat. When CM Rawat was the agriculture minister in the BJP government from 2007-2012, Om Prakash was the departmental secretary.

Additional Chief Secretary Radha Raturi is also eligible for the top bureaucratic post. She is a senior IAS officer and the wife of DGP Anil Raturi.

Nagpur: Amid the gloom due to Covid-19 pandemic, a data pipeline company Fivetran, based in Bengaluru, has bagged $100 million funding from investors led by Andreessen Horowitz — company which has also invested in Facebook, Skype, Airbnb, and Twitter earlier.

Fivetran is a growth stage start-up and the co-founder of the US-based business’s India operations — Vikram Labhe — has a Nagpur connect. Labhe did his schooling from Saraswati Vidyalaya, completed engineering from Ramdeobaba College. He left Nagpur in 1996 for Canada before settling in Bengaluru.

Labhe says the company with a 350-strong workforce also has a number of employees from Nagpur. “Even at present, a few freshers are from Nagpur. Two employees, who are scheduled to join from August, are also from the city,” Labhe told TOI.

“There will be some intake from January to June next year, and Nagpur, especially graduates from Ramdeobaba, are expected to have a sizeable share,” he said.

As work continues from home due to Covid outbreak, a number of employees are back in the city, said Labhe, who is also in Nagpur for a month now.

Labhe said Fivetran offers data services to a cross-section — from retail to engineering. He said if Covid has hit other businesses, it has brightened prospects for this segment. As online gets higher preference during the pandemic times, the prospects of a data pipeline company like Fivetran has gone up, he said.

“For example, in retail industry, if the brick and mortar segment has taken a hit, the online mode has grown. Again, data is a valuable asset in the business where companies like ours have a role. Even in pharmaceutical sector where tests are happening remotely, data plays an important role,” said Labhe.

The funds garnered in the current round will be used in sales, engineering and marketing, he said.

289,['29/07/2020'],Consider providing Rs 500 crore for Amrapali projects: Supreme Court to Centre,"Supreme Court

NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Tuesday said the Centre should provide funds to complete construction of the stalled housing projects of the Amrapali Group, which is being done under the apex court’s supervision, and asked the solicitor general to talk to the authorities concerned on providing a fund Rs 500 crore .

“We want some finances for construction. Can you find out how and from where the money can come. Come out with some suggestions,” a bench of Justices Arun Mishra and U U Lalit told Solicitor General Tushar Mehta at the outset of the proceedings while hearing the Amrapali case.

Mehta said he was not appearing for the Centre in the case but for Greater Noida authority. The bench, however, asked him to use his good offices to convince the government on releasing funds.

Apex court-appointed receiver and senior advocate R Venkataramani, who has been entrusted with the task of managing the affairs of the Group, told the bench that he had a meeting with the expenditure secretary and he will file proposal before the finance ministry on how the government could step in to help in completing the housing projects. He said the government could persuade a consortium of banks to provide funds.

Referring to the Unitech case in which an independent Board of Directors appointed by the Centre has taken over the management of the Group and filed revival plan in the SC for its approval, the solicitor general said similar thing could also be done in the Amrapali case. Mehta assured the court that all attempts will be made on the suggestions given by the court.

The bench, however, said it had already appointed a committee but it could be expanded on the proposal of the government.

If the Centre agreed to release funds for Amrapali projects, it will be in addition to Rs 995 crore which SBI Capital had earlier proposed to provide for eight projects in Noida and Greater Noida out of SWAMIH (Special Window for Completion of Construction of Affordable and Mid-Income Housing Projects) Investment Fund created by the Centre and being managed by the bank.

It has been nearly a year since the SC took over management of the Group, but construction work remained sluggish due to fund crunch as NBCC, which has been given the task to complete the projects, refused to invest while buyers were not able to clear their dues with banks refusing to disburse money.

The court had in the last hearing directed CMDs of banks and financial institutions to start releasing funds to home-buyers which would be used for construction.

Recently, KMC commissioner Binod Kumar wrote to the city’s clubs requesting them to provide ambulances that were either donated or purchased for transporting Covid patients in times of urgency. KMC’s health department has also tied up with a couple of NGOs that run ambulance and hearse services.

According to a health department official, the civic body has tied up with a north Kolkata-based private agency for supply of hearses daily. “At a preliminary stage, the agency has agreed to provide five hearses every day. This will help us tide over the crisis to some extent. However, the actual requirement is much higher,” conceded the KMC official.

An official said that several NGOs that run hearse services are reluctant to share their vehicles for fear of infection. “A section of NGOs running hearse services are reluctant to provide their vehicles for carrying the bodies of Covid victims for fear of infection. Though we are trying to convince them that proper disinfection would be carried out by the KMC every time a hearse carries a Covid victim, some NGOs are unwilling,” he said.

Besides taking help of the five hearses, the KMC health department could press into service 10 such vehicles regularly.

On the other hand, the civic brass has requested ward coordinators to search for ambulances from clubs in their respective wards. Another official said the civic body had a fleet of 22 ambulances that was grossly insufficient for carrying serious patients to hospitals.

Arup Chakraborty, a ward coordinator in the Garia-Patuli belt, said he has been able to convince a few local clubs to transport serious patients. Sandipan Saha, a ward coordinator from the Janbazar-Rafi Ahmed Kidwai Road area, is also banking on ambulances from local clubs for transporting Covid patients. However, both of them said some clubs were apprehensive of the driver and health workers getting infected.

I have directed the departmental officials to ensure that work is done at a rapid pace and round the clock during the weekend lockdowns.”

Kaushik pointed out that shops and other establishments remain closed during the weekend due to the lockdown and therefore, there will be no hindrance in the work. “There is less traffic on the road and the movement of people is also restricted. These factors will facilitate fast-paced work,” said the minister.

The officials present in the meeting were also directed to make an elaborate plan in advance for the laying of gas pipelines in the city. “Several projects like drain construction, road repair and construction, among others, are under progress and we are trying to complete them at the earliest,” the minister added.

On July 18, the LMA had shut four major roads, including Allahabad Gate , Wellington Road, Gough Road and Ordnance Road at AOC Circle, and other civilian roads in Bolarum (covering north-eastern part of Secunderabad) because of the surge in Covid-19 cases in Secunderabad Cantonment and adjoining civilian areas abutting the military stations at Trimulgherry and Bolarum.

Due to pressure from the residential welfare associations (RWAs) of nearly 150 residential colonies, the Congress and TRS leaders took up the matter with SCB authorities and LMA and urged them to keep the roads open by following the Ministry of Defence (MoD) orders.

296,['29/07/2020'],New therapy hope for critical patients,"KOLKATA: After using drugs meant to treat other ailments in the battle against Covid, doctors are now exploring different treatment therapies. The latest one to be tried on critical patients in Kolkata is CytoSorb where toxins from blood are removed to inhibit the inflammatory response to severe infection.

Doctors said some Covid patients, who develop severe complications, experience cytokine storm or cytokine release syndrome ( CRS ), causing inflammation that could lead to organ failure. Cytokine is a group of proteins produced by cells. CytoSorb therapy is to counter this by reducing cytokine storm.

“Our patient was diabetic and needed high oxygen flow. When he failed to respond to steroids, we decided to deploy CytoSorb therapy to purify his blood while using a medicine to prevent the release of a cytokine called interleukin 6 (IL-6) that plays a critical role in causing CRS,” said critical care specialist Arindam Kar, whose team treated Salt Lake businessman SK Sharma.

Experts said increased level of IL-6 in blood is correlated with respiratory failure, acute respiratory distress syndrome and often bad clinical outcome. “When Arindam Kar and his team counselled us for the therapy we agreed as it was the last resort. My father is now back home,” said son Prateek. The 53-year-old was admitted to Belle Vue Clinic on June 19 where he was found infected. He was discharged from the hospital about a week ago.

“We have used the therapy on three Covid patients so far, including one who was on ECMO support. Intervention has to be at the right time for successful outcome,” said critical care specialist Dipanjan Chatterjee of Medica Superspecialty Hospital.

“If rising toxin level is not arrested it could lead to lung as well failure of other organs. CytoSorb therapy removes these toxins. But it is meant for very sick patients,” said Sauren Panja, critical care and internal medicine specialist at RN Tagore International Institute of Cardiac Sciences.

“Cost is a factor. So, we have to be meticulous while deploying the therapy keeping in mind affordability, pros and cons and the likely outcome,” said pulmonologist Raja Dhar of Fortis Hospital where they have used it on one patient.

A patient might need two to three sessions.

297,['29/07/2020'],U’khand to place sign boards of network connectivity in hill and forest areas,"Dehradun: Tourism minister Satpal Maharaj, during the monthly review meeting on Tuesday, asked the department officials to ensure that signboards regarding mobile network connectivity are placed across the state in border or interior areas to alert the travellers that there is no mobile connectivity beyond that point. The minister also announced to give one year extra time to the project of Surkanda Devi ropeway where involvement of a Chinese firm was found in earlier inspections.

During the review of more than 50 different projects of tourism departments, which was headed by tourism secretary Dilip Jawalkar, the minister instructed the officials to ensure the construction of toilets for passengers on all the travel routes of the state.

“Placement of sign boards with warning of mobile connectivity will help people to make calls before reaching to no network areas. This will help people to suffer in the absence of mobile networks,” said Satpal Maharaj.

Issuing another warning against the use of Chinese products or involvement of Chinese firms in tourism projects, Maharaj said that he has given one year extra time to department for completion of Surkanda Devi Ropeway project and strict guidelines have been issued to the department concerned to ensure only ‘Made in India’ products in the project.

The department officials were asked to prepare a project report for the facelift of the Gangotri and Yamunotri temples on the lines of Kedarnath and Badrinath shrines. The minister also asked the officials to speed up the works under the “13 district-13 destination scheme”.

298,['29/07/2020'],T cops issue circular on illegal animal sacrifices,"Hyderabad: Telangana police issued a circular stating that illegal animal sacrifices in the state without following rules of animal transport and slaughter is a punishable offence.

The order came after PETA India sent a letter to Telangana’s director general of police requesting that he take all possible measures to stop animal sacrifices which are prohibited under the Telangana Animals and Birds Sacrifices Prohibition Act, 1950.

Following which, the police headquarters issued an order to its senior officials directing them to implement this state law as well as central government laws related to the transportation and slaughter of animals and relevant directions of the SC.

In its letter, PETA India pointed out that Section 3 of the Telangana Animals and Birds Sacrifices Prohibition Act, 1950, states, “No person shall sacrifice any animal or bird in any place of religious worship or adoration or its precincts or in any congregation or procession connected with any religious worship in a public street.” The letter also mentions that on two matters regarding the sacrifice and killing of animals for meat, the SC ruled that animals can be slaughtered only in officially licensed slaughterhouses.

299,['29/07/2020'],Remove settlements below bridges: Experts,"Hawkers below Sealdah flyover

KOLKATA: The bridge advisory committee appointed by the government has recommended that all settlements below various bridges and flyovers across the city should be relocated. Bridge experts said these are detrimental to the structural healths of the bridges like Bijon setu, Sealdah flyover and Aurobindo setu.

The experts said that before the Kolkata Metropolitan Development Authority (KMDA) takes up full-fledged repair and strengthening work of Sealdah flyover, Aurobindo Setu and Bijon Setu in a few months’ time, the hawkers and other settlements below these bridges will have to be relocated.

The experts are concerned over the makeshift structures causing harm to the supporting wall and pillars of the bridges. A few days ago, cops were called in to stop a makeshift structure from coming up below Bijon Setu after the matter came to the KMDA’s notice.

The technical modalities have been completed as the KMDA officials are waiting for the financial approval from the state cabinet to take up major repairs of several bridges on a priority basis.

The four bridges where the work will be taken up on a priority basis are Ultadanga flyover, Baghajatin ROB, Chingrighata flyover and Kalighat bridge followed by other bridges like Sealdah flyover, Aurobindo Setu and Bijon Setu. The KMDA officials are already taking up the work to remove the extra bitumen layer to reduce load pressure from Sealdah flyover, Aurobindo Setu and some other bridges. Removal of tram lines on Sealdah flyover has also been planned.

Sources said the shifting of the hawkers with their settlements had already been discussed earlier, but no solution could be achieved.

National Hawker Federation general secretary Shaktiman Ghosh said they were waiting for a dialogue with the government over the issue. “Repairing the bridges is necessary. Hawkers’ livelihood should be considered. We are ready to discuss it with the government,” he added.

This is the first time since lockdown was lifted in the state that an entire town will shut shop for a fortnight. At a meeting with Nalgonda MLA K Bhupal Reddy and local officials , traders decided that the lockdown will be imposed from July 30 to August 14, and only shops selling essential commodities will be kept open till 1 pm.

“The lockdown is not official. But this is what the traders have decided as a measure to prevent the spread of Covid-19,” municipal commissioner Sharath Chandra told TOI. He said that the efforts being made by the municipal authorities to prevent the spread of the virus will continue during the lockdown.

A total of 300 cases have been reported in Nalgonda district . As Nalgonda town is the nerve centre of all activity in the district, the lockdown is expected to help in restricting the movement of people and thereby curtail the spread of the virus. Elsewhere in the state, villages are going on self-imposed lockdown for a few days to curb the spread of the virus.

According to TOI sources, a youth from a containment zone area of Uttarkashi town, who was booked under the SC/ST Act and was admitted to the district hospital a few days ago, was arrested by a police team from the hospital. However, the family members of the youth opposed the arrest and created nuisance in both the hospital and the police station.

302,['29/07/2020'],Law against indiscriminate water extraction needed: HC,"Kochi: Government should bring in a law to prevent indiscriminate extraction of groundwater by packaged drinking-water units, said the high court. While issuing permits for such units, welfare of the people should be given priority over business interest, the court said.

The observation was made by justice VG Arun after considering a petition (WP-C No. 12046/2013) filed by CS Sundaranpilla of Arabi near Iritty in Kannur through advocate Blaze K Jose. The petitioner had alleged indiscriminate extraction of groundwater in his village by St Marys Water Tech on the strength of a permit issued by the panchayat.

In the judgment, the court said, “Indiscriminate tapping of ground water by units like the third respondent (St Marys Water Tech), though on the strength of licences and clearance from the statutory authorities, even lead to water scarcity. It is true that at present, there is no law which prohibits grant of permission for conduct of units like that of the third respondent. The inadequacy of law is a matter which should engage the attention of the law makers. Being a Local Self Government Institution, the welfare of the people, as against the business interest of an individual, should weigh with the Panchayat, while granting licences/permits.”

As per the petitioner, the area is facing acute water shortage and is dependent on government’s Jalanidhi project for drinking water.

Pointing out the need for a law to curb indiscriminate water extraction by water-bottling units, the court directed the collector to decide on the complaint seeking closure of the unit.

304,['29/07/2020'],Rajasthan HC seeks government reply on plea to quash Gajendra Singh Shekhawat probe,"Gajendra Singh Shekhawat

JAIPUR: Rajasthan High Court on Tuesday sought response from the state government on a petition challenging a lower court order directing investigation against Union minister Gajendra Singh Shekhawat his family members and associates in the Rs 884-crore Sanjivani Credit Cooperative Society scam.

The high court issued the notice on a petition seeking quashing the lower court order by co-accused Kewal Chand Dakalia, the shareholder director of Navprabha Buildtech Pvt Ltd , who is said to be linked with Shekhawat.

Senior Advocate Mahesh Jethmalani argued the matter on behalf of the petitioner from Mumbai via video conference.

The high court has asked the state government to file its response by August 5.

The petition said, “When the investigation in the matter is already going on and there have been no allegations of bias against the investigating agency by the respondent, there was no occasion to warrant specific monitoring or intrusion by the court. It is in itself contradictory that there can be any further /proper investigation in an already ongoing investigation.”

A city ADJ court on July 21 directed a private complaint to be investigated by the SOG in relation to the money trail in the Sanjeevani Credit Cooperative Society scam case.

Shekhawat has been named along with his wife and others in the complaint related to the Sanjivani Credit Cooperative Society scam in which about 50,000 investors allegedly lost about Rs 884 crore.

The Jaipur unit of the SOG has been probing the scam case since last year. An FIR was registered in connection with the case on August 23, 2019.

Shekhawat was not named as an accused in the chargesheet filed by the SOG in connection with the case. In the investigation, the money trail was found to be linked to the real estate project of the minister and his associates including Kewal Chand Dakalia.

In their application by complainants Gulam Singh and Laboo Singh had claimed that a money trail mentioned in the FIR led to companies allegedly linked to the minister.

But the SOG did not investigate the role of Shekhawat or the company, the two Barmer residents had alleged. The complainants alleged that the SOG deliberately protected Shekhawat and some others who did not figure in the charge sheet.

The Special Operations Group has already sent a notice to the minister in connection with a probe into another case pertaining to audio clips which purportedly indicate efforts to lure MLAs away from the Congress .

NEW DELHI: With extended closure of courts taking its toll on litigation and lawyers , leading to depression and even death by suicide, help appears to be coming now from the judiciary.

On Tuesday, Justice Siddharth Mridul of Delhi high court contributed from his salary towards the lawyer’s welfare fund set up for Covid-19 by the Bar Council of Delhi ( BCD ), becoming the first judge to do so.

The fund has been set up by the council to help poor and needy lawyers hit hard by the closure of physical functioning of courts due to the pandemic. In a recent hearing before the high court, the BCD had submitted that since the start of the lockdown, it has paid a Rs 5,000 each to 16,448 advocates coming to a total of Rs 8.22 crore and the process is still on.

TOI has also learnt that following justice Mridul’s example, most judges posted at Rohini court complex plan to contribute significantly towards the welfare of lawyers so that the amount can be utilised for their benefit. The subordinate court judges are leant to have sought permission from the HC in this regard.

Speaking to TOI, Bar Council of Delhi chairman K C Mittal confirmed the development. “We are indeed grateful to honourable justice Siddharth Mridul for donating Rs 1 lakh to BCD. We hope that others also come forward to donate generously,” Mittal said.

The Bar Council of India also welcomed the help coming from the judiciary. Ved Prakash Sharma, co-chairman of BCI told TOI the Council “highly appreciates the affectionate gesture of Hon'ble Justice Sidharth Mridul in making a contribution in Lawyers' welfare fund of Bar Council of Delhi for financial assistance to young and needy lawyers distressed due to the pandemic Covid 19 and continued suspension of normal court functioning which has drained out their financial resources.”

Sharma added that justice Mridul is a former member and vice chairman of BCD and “has befittingly responded to the pathetic conditions lawyers are forced to live in due to the unprecedented crisis caused by the pandemic and closure of physical court functioning. This contribution made by justice Mridul will inspire all Senior members of the bar and Judges alike to do their bit for needy lawyers grappling with the worst phase of their life.”

Apart from a Covid fund, the BCD has also set up an Indigent and Disabled Lawyers' Committee, looking at the gravity of the prevailing situation, to support advocates suffering from COVID-19.

306,['29/07/2020'],Kerala: Wanderlust ‘drives’ this elderly Kottarakara couple,"Thankamma, 75, believes driving and touring have helped Paloor Pappachan, 80, keep happy and healthy

KOCHI: The pandemic and the resultant lockdown have increased the risk of social isolation of the elderly. The effects, however, have been felt differently by different people.

For Paloor Pappachan , an 80-year-old resident of Kottarakara , and his wife Thankamma , 75, both retired school teachers , this has meant derailed travel plans -- both within the country and beyond its shores.

A passionate driver even at his age, Pappachan misses the frequent road trips the couple took across south India. Even now, this octogenarian is crazy about driving and the couple is busy with their post-Covid travel plans.

Ever since Pappachan’s retirement in 1997, the couple has been chasing the dream by going on one or two tours every year. Being avid leftists, their first priority were the communist countries: China and Russia. Frankfurt, Paris, London and Sydney have also been crossed off the list. In India, they have visited places such as Jaipur, Kolkata, Delhi, Mumbai, and Hyderabad, among others, by train.

“Countries like the US, Canada, UAE are in our list. Our children and grandchildren are well-settled. By god’s grace we are healthy and have the financial background to fulfil our dreams. But Covid-19 has forced us to stay indoors. We are not used to this, but there is no way out. We will resume our tours once the pandemic is over,” says Pappachan, sitting in the driver’s seat of his favourite MUV.

Before he became a school teacher, Pappachan was a driver in the Indian Army and has driven trucks during the wars with China and Pakistan. It was his passion for driving large trucks that made him join the Army at the age of 20. “I was in the Army for six years and returned to join the school in my native place as a physical education instructor. Alongside I started a ration shop and was a timber trader. Driving large trucks and vehicles to other states as part of work has been a passion which refuses to die down,” he said.

Thankamma believes driving and touring have helped Pappachan keep happy and healthy. “Before the lockdown, visiting Madurai and Kuttalam at least twice a month was his hobby. Most of these trips are unplanned. He would decide, on the spur of the moment, to make the 85km drive to Kuttalam waterfalls alone. Sometimes, he would ask me to accompany him. During festivals, we do the shopping in Madurai, so that he could drive there,” says Thankamma.

Third-year students of NHL Municipal Medical College and LG Hospital and Medical College challenged the circular issued by the colleges on July 17, July 22 and July 24, asking them to assist in the fight against Covid-19. They contended that such “voluntarism” cannot be thrust upon them. Had they been called for voluntary service earlier, they would have gladly joined, but now they have to focus on their studies and examinations. They have argued in the petition that four months of their academic sessions have been wasted. “Had the petitioners been called a few months earlier they would have been wedded to the call of the nation,” their petition reads.

The students took strong exception to the threat of action against them under the Epidemic Disease Act and the Disaster Management Act, and that the colleges would not clear their present term, which would render them disqualified for final-year studies. They submitted that the government can summon anybody for duty under these laws, but they should be spared at this juncture. The work they are required for could be given to health workers, compounders or nurses, who are now available in abundance due to the prevailing unemployment.

These students cited the example of a Surat medical college that has offered incentives in the form of grace marks, accommodation etc to MBBS students for volunteering as corona sahayaks. In Ahmedabad, some students joined the training modules under duress and threat. They reiterated that “any voluntary service cannot be compulsory”.

Requesting the quashing of the circular and show-cause notices issued by AMC colleges, they argued that pursuing studies is their fundamental right. They submitted that there are 22 medical colleges in the state and nearly 3,000 students are in Part I and Part II of the third year. Of all these colleges, only AMC-run colleges have taken such a decision that risks the lives of students in the time of a pandemic.

Telangana Sona has the lowest glycemic index among all known varieties of paddy in the state, making it ideal for rice-eating diabetic population. Telangana Sona (RNR 15048) is a paddy variety developed by PJTSAU with characteristics such as fine grain, high yielding quality and blast resistance. The paddy variety is advantageous for farmers as it grows in a relatively shorter time (125 days vs the average of 150 days) and is suitable for cultivation in both vanakalam and yasangi (kharif and rabi) seasons.

Further, in comparison to other popular varieties of paddy, the composition of protein, carbohydrates, energy, niacin (vitamin B3) is also higher.

Speaking about the importance of the new paddy variety, B Janardhan Reddy, secretary to government, agriculture department, said: “Sometimes, initially a good face also requires make-up. Similarly, Telangana Sona needs branding and market.”

HYDERABAD: A week before the ground-breaking ceremony of Ram temple in Ayodhya, AIMIM president Asaduddin Owaisi lashed out at Prime Minister Narendra Modi. He said by attending the bhumi puja in his official capacity as PM, Modi would be violating the constitutional oath he took when he assumed office.

The bhumi puja is slated for August 5, which will be attended by the PM. In a tweet on Tuesday, the AIMIM chief said: “Secularism is part of the Basic Structure of Constitution. We can’t forget that for over 400 years Babri stood in Ayodhya & it was demolished by a criminal mob in 1992 (sic).” Speaking to a news agency, the AIMIM president said the PM should not attend the event. If he attends the function as PM, a message would go across the country that the Prime Minister is supporting one faith. “If he attends the event in his individual capacity, nobody will raise an objection and like others, he can also follow his religion. But, the PM is also a constitutional head and the Constitution is related to the basic structure of secularism,” Asaduddin said.

The Hyderabad MP said even if the PM wants to go in his personal capacity, no television channel should telecast it live. Reacting to the tweet, Telangana BJP president Bandi Sanjay said Modi can attend any event related to the Ram mandir since the Supreme Court had already given a verdict on the issue. He said Asaduddin did not have respect or faith in courts, Constitution and people. “Hindus also won’t forget the history and atrocities on them across the country,” the BJP president said.

He had said, “The Supreme Court is supreme, but not infallible. These are not my words. I am reiterating the words of Justice JS Verma.” He also said Muslims should reject the five acres given to them to build a mosque.

When SC delivered verdict on Ram Janmabhoomi-Babri Masjid title dispute last year, AIMIM president expressed his dissatisfaction and termed it as a “victory of faith over facts”

This is the first reported dengue death in the city this season. Doctors said while the focus was on Covid , the administration should also take up measures to counter the mosquito menace. At least three more children are admitted to Institute of Child Health (ICH) with dengue fever.Faizan Ahmed (12) from Tiljala had been suffering from fever for the past few days. According to the hospital, the boy’s family brought him to ICH on Monday night in a critical condition. Because of his serious condition, doctors admitted to the boy in the hospital’s PICU (paediatric intensive care unit). From the symptoms doctors suspected dengue and sent the boy’s samples for confirmation.“The boy died of dengue shock syndrome in the PICU. He was admitted on Monday night in a serious condition. We got his dengue-positive report about an hour after his death,” said paediatric intensivist Prabhas Prasun Giri, in charge of the PICU at ICH.The hospital currently has three more dengue-positive children undergoing treatment, including one in the PICU. Condition of the three, however, is stable, doctors said. So far, the hospital has treated 12 children for dengue, including five in the PICU. Most of the children were from Tiljala, Topsia and Park Circus localities.“While countering Covid, we must not be ignoring dengue. In such a case, things can turn very ugly on the dengue front. A few days ago, we even got a boy, who was down with both dengue and Covid,” said Giri.A boy from Beniapukur, who was brought to ICH on July 21, was found infected with both Covid and dengue.

The 25-year-old man had to undergo a minor surgery to remove the keys from his forehead.

A video of the bike rider, identified as Deepak Koli, that showed the keys sticking out from his bleeding temple has gone viral on social media. The incident occurred on Monday when Koli, who was riding the bike as his friend sat pillion, was stopped by the City Patrol Unit team at Indira Chowk for not wearing a helmet. An argument ensued and one of the policemen allegedly jabbed Koli’s forehead with the keys of the bike. Koli was taken to the hospital where he had to undergo a minor surgery to take the keys out.

As the video of the incident was shared on social media, 100-odd residents of Rampura Colony — where Koli lives — hit the roads demanding action against cops’ brutality. A mob also pelted stones at the Rampura police outpost and city police station and attempted to vandalise vehicles and public property. Police had to resort to lathicharge. The mob was pacified after local MLA Rajkumar Thakral and superintendent of police (crime) Pramod Kumar rushed to the spot.

On Tuesday, 100 unidentified people were booked for rioting, unlawful assembly and under various other sections of the IPC.

“The director general of police (law and order), Ashok Kumar, has issued suspension orders of three cops, including sub-inspector Ram Praveen and constables Virendra Chauhan and Jagdish Joshi,” the SP told TOI.

A probe into the incident is being led by circle officer (Bazpur) Deepshikha Agrawal.

314,['29/07/2020'],"Cadasta Foundation, Waatavaran to secure forest rights under FRA","Nagpur: Cadasta Foundation and Waatavaran have joined hands to secure the land claims of scheduled caste and tribal communities in Western India.

Cadasta, the US-based non-profit organization, and Waatavaran began collaborating in October 2019 in support of a shared mission to promote equitable and sustainable development.

With funding from Omidyar India and Nudge Foundation, Waatavaran is leveraging training and tools offered by Cadasta to more efficiently map and collect community spatial and household data for scheduled caste and tribal communities living in the forests of Raigad district in Maharashtra.

Currently, these communities lack any form of formal records or proof of their communal and individual forest rights. Once documented, the community and individual claims will be submitted to local village councils for the first step of approval of their formal individual and community forest right titles under the Forest Rights Act ( FRA ) of 2006.

Using Cadasta’s Esri-based platform — with its accessible satellite imagery, mobile tools, and digital maps — the project began data collection last month and aims to document 2,000 households, representing 12,000 citizens.

Commenting on their partnership with Cadasta, Waatavaran founder and CEO Bhagwan Kesbhat said, “Even though satellite imagery is accepted as an evidentiary document for claiming land rights under the FRA, its use was unexplored in Maharashtra until our collaboration with Cadasta.”

“Working with Cadasta has given us access to innovative technology that allows us to use satellite imagery to map land parcels which will be submitted soon as evidentiary documents,” he said.

Kesbhat continues, “Cadasta’s user-friendly platform allows us to work in remote areas both online and offline and has enabled us to conduct on-site mapping, surveys, and submission of documents that has helped us engage, develop, and strengthen our bonds of trust with these tribal communities.”

The Cadasta platform has also eased the process of data collection due to its convenient digital interface. The data stored on the server can be accessed at any time and thus manual paperwork is reduced.

Moreover, since the application is available on mobile phones, its accessibility is maximized and no high-tech devices were required for land mapping. As the survey format for collecting data can be converted into multiple regional languages, it has widened ability to reach locals.

This technology holds great potential to be scaled up and used to create a digital database of these land parcels.

Reflecting on the partnership, Cadasta CEO Amy Coughenour noted, “Cadasta is thrilled to partner with Waatavaran, a climate justice leader in India. By working together to document and secure the land and forest rights of tribal communities in Maharashtra, we are helping communities protect forest land and improve their livelihoods.”

With Waatavaran’s strategic community work and Cadasta’s innovative tools and training, this project will lead to empowerment of forest dwelling individuals and communities to sustainably use, manage, govern, and protect forest land and resources now and for generations to come.

Founded in 2015, Cadasta Foundation develops and promotes use of simple digital tools and technology to help partners efficiently document, analyse, store, and share critical land and resource rights information.

“By creating an accessible digital record of land, property, and resource rights, we help empower individuals, communities, organizations, governments, and businesses with the information they need to make data-driven decisions and put vulnerable communities and their needs on the map,” says Coughenour.

Waatavaran is a social venture based in Mumbai, which believes in a climate just environment.

NEW DELHI: Around 5pm on Tuesday, National Investigation Agency ( NIA ) informed Jenny Rowena that her husband, DU associate professor Hany Babu MT, had been arrested in connection with the Bhima Koregaon incident. Since then, she can’t understand “what is happening”.

“He had got a summon two weeks ago. We thought it was for the recording of the witness statement as he is working with the defence committee” for the release of DU teacher G N Saibaba, Rowena, who also teaches at Delhi University, told TOI. But NIA is saying it has found “a folder in My Document section of a laptop, which has highly incriminating material showing him as a top Maoist leader”, she said. “They had asked him for an explanation and said only after that he will be allowed to go.”

On September 10, 2019, Pune Police raided the house of the English department teacher and seized laptops, books and other electronic materials. Babu has been the convener of the defence committee for disabled Saibaba, who has been charged under Unlawful Activities Prevention Act and is lodged in the anda cell of Nagpur Central Jail. His bail plea was rejected again on Tuesday.

According to Rowena, the documents NIA is citing are from February to April 2019. “NIA asked if those documents were put in by students or by me. But Babu told them it wasn’t his. We are not even connected with any political group,” she said.

DU teachers and students have called Babu’s arrest a witch-hunt and demanded release of political prisoners.

All India Students’ Association said students would fight against these unlawful arrests, while Students’ Federation of India also called the case fabricated.

“This absolute fascist attack on every single democratic voice is utterly dangerous,” said Abha Dev Habib, a teacher at Miranda House.

316,['29/07/2020'],Surat: Art silk shortage hits Banarasi sari makers,"The production of art silk, used in weaving of Banarasi saris, has come down to 500 tonne per month from over ... Read More

SURAT: Manufacturing of the famed Banarasi saris in PM Narendra Modi’s constituency Varanasi and other weaving centres in Uttar Pradesh has been hit hard due to lockdown that resulted in decrease in production of key raw material — art silk yarn , from Surat.

The production of art silk or polyester silk yarn, used in the weaving of Banarasi saris, has come down to 500 tonne per month from over 11,000 tonne per month pre-lockdown, mainly because of the exodus of migrant workers.

Surat is the largest supplier of art silk yarn to the Banarasi sari weavers in Varanasi and Mau districts — the main manufacturing hubs for the famed saris.

Industry sources said that about half a dozen yarn spinners manufacture art silk yarn in Surat. While about 70% of the multi-coloured yarn is supplied to Banarasi sari weaver, the rest is supplied to the garment units for suiting and shirting, dress material for a blended silk fabric texture.

Shakeel Ahmed, a Banarasi sari weaver having 300 weaving machines in Mau and Varanasi districts, told TOI, “Pre-lockdown the daily production of Banarasi saris in Varanasi and Mau districts put together was about four lakh pieces per day, which has now come down to less than 20,000 pieces per day.""

“Our monthly consumption of art silk yarn is in the range of 200-250 tonnes. Post-lockdown, we are getting less than 40 tonnes from Surat,” added Ahmed.

Another weaver in Varanasi, Shoeb Ommarji told TOI, “Weavers here are totally dependent on Surat for the supply of raw material. We expect a hike in demand for Banarasi saris with the fast approaching festival season in August.”

Till a few years ago, the weavers of Banarasi saris were using imported Chinese silk yarn for manufacturing the heavy, zardozi-worked silk . However, the anti-dumping duty on the imported silk yarn gave an opportunity to the Surat yarn manufacturers to provide an alternative to the imported silk yarn. For the last few years, Surat has been supplying its synthetic variant of silk yarn in a variety of colours.

Chairman of Madhusudan Group, Girdhar Gopal Mundra, told TOI, “There is no production of yarn at our unit due to the shortage of workers. We are the largest supplier of art silk yarn to Varanasi and Mau. We have the old stock of yarn, but we are supplying it to those who are able to pay us in cash.”

Another yarn manufacturer, Vinay Agarwal said, “Ramping up production of yarn requires huge investment. Currently, we are producing less than 10% of our manufacturing capacity. Also, there is a huge amount outstanding of the weavers in Varanasi and we can’t take the risk of supplying them yarn on credit, though we have old stock lying with us.”

This restriction, they say, will begin from Wednesday (July 29) and continue till August 15.

“Despite opposition by priests, the state government started the Char Dham Yatra. This has increased the threat of spread of the pandemic in the shrine. Therefore, priests and seers residing in the shrine have decided to ban the entry of any outsider in the Gangotri town,” said Suresh Semwal, president of Gangotri temple committee.

Echoing his viewpoint, Deepak Semwal, general secretary of Gangotri temple committee, said, “The priest community also had hopes for a great yatra season this year, but unfortunately a deadly virus has spread all over the globe and the situation is turning worse day by day in our country and state. It is not wise to start the yatra during such dire times. We have decided to restrict the entry of outsiders to contain the spread of contamination in the shrine and nearby villages.”

Meanwhile, the local administration has decried the move and assured that they will convince the priests to open the shrine. “We will talk to the priests and convince them to open the shrine so that pilgrims can visit the temple without any trouble,” said Uttarkashi district magistrate Ashish Chauhan. The official added that all necessary steps to check the spread of the virus in the district are being taken.

JAIPUR: State BJP president Satish Poonia on Tuesday questioned Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra’s silence over the ‘illegal’ merger of BSP MLAs with the Congress.

He was reacting to a tweet by Vadra where she called BSP supremo Mayawati (without naming) as the undeclared spokesperson of the BJP after the latter announced to challenge the merger in the Supreme Court and teach chief minister Ashok Gehlot a lesson.

“Today you are calling them (BSP) BJP’s spokesperson but don’t forget that you made your government in Rajasthan riding on the back of these spokespersons. You didn’t tweet that time when your party snatched the BSPs mandate in the state. You are accusing us of killing the spirit of democracy and constitution in the country. Do read the history of your family how they have assaulted the democracy,” said Poonia.

Responding to allegation of his party playing an active role in toppling the Congress government, Poonia said that it is the Congress party which has made gross misuse of Article 356.

“The Congress has a record in toppling the democratically elected governments. It is time that you should look after your house and do not blame others for the disorder in your party,” said Poonia.

Poonia reminded Congress that they had achieved the mandate in 2008 and 2018 by ‘illegally’ merging BSP MLAs.

“Rajasthan Congress has earned the distinction in getting mandate by eating away the smaller parties and independents. This management is part of the Congress working style,” said Poonia.

He also questioned the Bharatiya Tribal Party (BTP) support to the Congress party two days after one of the MLA Rajkumar Roat videos of him being harassed by the police went viral.

“The MLA Roat seen slamming the government seen supporting the party and changing his statement in a press conference clearly shows what is happening in the Congress camp lodged in a hotel since July 13,” said Poonia.

321,['29/07/2020'],More protection can help Kawal tiger status: Report,"HYDERABAD: Though ‘Status of Tiger Report-2018’ said Telangana has 26 big cats, ‘Tiger Census’, which was released by the Union environment ministry on the eve of Global Tiger Day on Tuesday, revealed that both Kawal tiger reserve and Amrabad tiger reserve have “smaller tiger population and are below their potential”.

Along with the population estimates of tigers in reserves for 2018-19, the report, ‘Status of Tigers– Co-predators and Prey in India’ said: “Of 50 tiger reserves in the country, 11, including Kawal and Amrabad in Telangana, were below their potential and require resources and targeted management to increase tiger population.

“In areas where tigers have not been recorded or the population has declined, restoration needs to proceed by improving protection, augmentation of prey, and reintroduction of tigers from an appropriate source,” it said. The tiger status of Kawal, and Amrabad would benefit substantially with enhanced protection and better law and order situation, it added.

However, while the total population of the tiger in Telangana still stands at 26 as estimated by ‘Tiger Status Report’, the report released on Tuesday indicates that only 10 tigers were identified in Kawal, Amrabad, Kagaznagar and Chennur forest areas.

“If there are 2,970 tigers in India, all these big cats are not identified with camera trap images, direct sighting or definite evidences. Of them, only about 800 or 900 would be through definite evidences and the rest could be through calculations, depending on indirect evidences,” senior forest official A Shankaran said.

“For instance, if they said Amrabad has seven tigers, it means there are seven definite information through camera trap images or scat which is analysed in a lab. It is the same with the remaining three tigers identified in Kawal, Chennur and Kagaznagar. Rest 16 tigers are calculated using indirect evidences such as pug marks, faecal droppings and scratches on trees and left-over prey,” he added.

However, wildlife conservationists say the mismatch in tiger numbers and tiger-bearing forests published in the report were a matter of serious concern. “As per Tiger Action Task force we cannot consider these methods of direct and indirect sightings. So, we should go by accepted method. Pugmark methods were faulty generally over estimating numbers and have been discontinued since 2006. I am sure the NTCA is not using it anymore. Why numbers are different only WII ( Wildlife Institute of India ) can probably explain,” said Diya Sur Banerjee, a wildlife conservationist.

The report also states that a few tiger bearing forest areas in Telangana such as Chennur forest division are vulnerable to poaching.

The operators who informed the state government about their latest decision said they were forced to resort to such an extreme strep as running the service was proving increasingly unviable in these pandemic times without proper support from the government.

The Kerala State Private Bus Operators’ Federation leaders said the recent fare hike announced by the state government too has failed to mitigate the losses of the bus owners. “The private bus industry is going through the worst time in its history. The marginal increase in fares could have reflected in the collection but has been sucked out by the diesel price increase. Though buses resumed service by May 19, not even 20% of private buses hit the roads since then. The scene did not change a bit even after the state government agreed for an increase in fare later on. Not many people are ready to board the buses due to the fear of Covid-19,” said federation chairman Lawrence Babu.

Where an average Rs 700 increase was expected from the fare hike, the steep increase in diesel prices not only set off the prospective gain, but also deepened the magnitude of loss, said the federation general secretary T Gopinathan.

In view of the impossible situation, the bus operators would be submitting G-Form at the respective RTP offices to save themselves from paying road tax.

The EB officials said they would be raiding the markets regularly before lockdown days to keep the prices in check. They collected the prices of essentials like rice, cereals and pulses in the past few days.

“We carried out the raids to ensure that there was no hoarding and that people were not charged above the maximum retail price . We also wanted to ensure that no shop was closed, causing inconvenience to people,” said a police officer, adding that they had enquired whether there had been short supply at Koley Market.

According to Mattewada inspector T Ganesh, the frustrated relatives vent their ire on the furniture inside the Covid-19 ward. Ironically, the ward didn’t have an oxygen cylinder to help patients with breathing problems. The duty doctor said the patient had respiratory problem and was suffering with Covid-19 symptoms. He was admitted in the Covid-19 ward. “His samples were collected and sent for testing. Within an hour, the patient’s condition turned serious and we informed his relatives that he requires oxygen. However, we do not have an oxygen cylinder here and we suggested to them to take him immediately to a private hospital or Gandhi Hospital. Meanwhile, the patient’s condition worsened and he died in the hospital,” the doctor said.

“Soon after the man’s death, his relatives damaged furniture and threw chairs at the doctors. They also broke window panes. We immediately informed police. The Mattewada police rushed to the hospital and convinced the enraged attendants to cool down. They are now investigating the case,” he added.

MGM hospital superintendent resigns: Meanwhile, MGM hospital superintendent B Srinivasa Rao resigned and sent a copy of his resignation to the DME . He stated that he has been suffering from high blood pressure and was feeling ill for the past two weeks.

NEW DELHI: At least nine policemen on duty in the Red Fort area were caught sleeping during a security inspection conducted on Saturday night after a woman was allegedly raped and hit with a stone in a park behind the high-security zone in the early afternoon.

The woman has alleged that the accused, who used to stay with her at a nearby footpath, raped her in the park. When she resisted, he allegedly hit her with a stone too. Hearing her cries for help, a security official deployed at Red Fort reached the spot, but the accused managed to flee.

The security official found the woman in an injured state in the park and police took her to a nearby hospital. “The woman said she was in the park with her two-year-old daughter when the accused tried to force himself on her. As the security official came running, the man fled with the survivor’s daughter. However, the child was later found in the park and reunited with her mother in the evening. The man was arrested the following day,” said a senior police officer.

Soon after the incident, the top brass ordered an inspection of security arrangements and told police officers to ensure that nobody entered isolated stretches or parks in the area.

The inspection was conducted by sub-inspector Raj Pal Meena, who is in charge of the Red Fort police post. In a diary entry, Meena reported, “In view of the upcoming Independence Day celebrations, I carried out a check and found an ASI deployed at the main entry gate sleeping.” A constable was found sleeping in his car near Sunehri Masjid and two more on duty at the Shanti Van Chowk point were caught sleeping inside a traffic booth, Meena added.

Near the central gate, another constable had placed a polythene sheet and slept on it, while at the Chatta rail point, two were found sleeping inside a traffic booth. Two more constables on duty were sleeping in their car. “A video of the cops on duty and sleeping was also made,” the officer reported.

After senior officers were informed about the cops, they were removed from duty and sent back to their battalions, a source said.

327,['29/07/2020'],Level in Naini lake hits July record,"Nainital: As water level in Naini lake broke its all-time record in July by touching 10 feet 9 inches, its floodgates were opened on Tuesday.

The Naini lake is a major tourist attraction in Nainital and the only source of drinking water for over 40,000 residents of the town. On Sunday, the water level in the lake touched 10 feet 9 inches.

The officials of the irrigation department, the body tasked with maintaining the lake, said that the floodgates have been opened an inch each to let the water level come down to around 10 feet. HC Singh, executive engineer, Nainital irrigation division, said, “Regulations mandate that water should be retained upto eight feet six inches in the month of July. The water level by the end of August should be around 10 feet. However, since the water level is already nearing 11 feet, which is the level for mid-September, it has been decided to open the floodgates.”

Singh added that the lake’s floodgates have been opened in a limited way so that there is no damage caused to the nearby areas. “We aim to bring down and then maintain the water level in the lake at around 10 feet.”

Keeping in view the safety of people, Jeolikote police has advised people not to go near the drains Baliya and Gaula.

Experts as well as officials of the irrigation department have credited the Covid- induced lockdown for the rise in water level in the lake. “The water level in the lake generally goes down in summers. In May 2017, it had dropped to -7ft. However, since there has been almost no tourist activity since late March because of the lockdown, the water level has been steadily rising,” said Ajay Singh Rawat, a Nainital-based environmentalist.

329,['29/07/2020'],SC refuses to tinker with Vikas Dubey panel,"Supreme Court of India

NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Tuesday rejected spirited attempts by two PIL petitioners to get ex-DGP K L Gupta, a member of the Justice B S Chauhan Commission inquiring into the killing of eight policemen and the subsequent encounter killings of gangster Vikas Dubey and his four associates, replaced.

Two advocates-cum-PIL petitioners, Ghanshyam Upadhyay and Anoop Prakash Awasthi, read out portions of Gupta’s interview to various media organisations purportedly siding with the police action immediately after the July 10 encounter killing of Dubey while he was being brought by Special Task Force personnel from Ujjain to Kanpur.

They said the bias emerging from Gupta’s alleged statements, unabashedly justifying the police action, would influence the commission’s work and rob it of public trust. But solicitor general Tushar Mehta , appearing for the UP government, told the court that it was unfortunate that the petitioners chose to project only half the picture before the court by citing select portions of his interview.

The bench, which was initially sceptical of the ex-DGP’s statement as read out by the petitioners, was unhappy with the two advocates for presenting a one-sided picture before the court. After the SG showed the transcript of the full interview to the court, the CJI said, “What is not upright about Gupta? He has also said that the guilty will be punished after an inquiry. The man has taken a balanced view. Also, there is a former Supreme Court judge and an ex-high court judge in the commission. How can the commission’s findings be vitiated?”

This pool of resource persons will certainly be a boon to the state, which is staring at the shortage of manpower to treat the rising number of Covid-19 patients, according to health experts.

The university has also requested the private medical colleges to set up at least one Covid-19 treatment centre under them by deploying their faculties and PG students.

KUHS vice-chancellor Dr Mohan Kunnummal said the list of the fresh graduates were submitted as per the suggestion from the government.

“We have suggested to the government that these fresh graduates can be incentivized to work in the Covid treatment centres if they are provided proper accommodation and quarantine facilities. Also, most of them are in the process of preparing for higher studies. So, it will be helpful if they can be given some grace marks for the PG entrance examination. The government has responded positively to our suggestions,” Kunnummal said.

The VC has written an open letter to all the fresh graduates appealing them to support the government’s efforts to combat Covid-19. In his letter to them, Dr Kunnummal said they “will be appointed shortly with reasonable salary, and all facilities will be provided for your safe stay. The safety of your families will also be given due consideration”.

“You are graduating at a very critical time in the history of mankind, when the Covid-19 pandemic is threatening the very existence of the human race. We all decided to become health professionals with a commitment to help our fellow citizens. This is the time to demonstrate our commitment to our brothers and sisters,” he said in the letter.

Dr Kunnummal said he had held a webinar with the principals of the private medical colleges on Tuesday and suggested they start Covid treatment centres either in the hospitals attached to them or in another facility. “They have also promised to implement this suggestion,” he said.

Meanwhile, another woman, from Pithoragarh’s Jarajibli village, went missing.

The regional meteorological centre, on Tuesday, issued a red alert of heavy-to-very heavy rainfall, especially in the districts of Kumaon region, while the Garhwal region too is expected to witness heavy rainfall. “Isolated places in Pithoragarh, Udham Singh Nagar, and Nainital districts might receive spells of extremely heavy rainfall as well,” said Bikram Singh, director of Met office.

In the first accident, a house collapsed in Padergaon village of Chamoli district following a cloudburst triggered by downpour. A woman reportedly died in the accident while her minor daughter sustained injuries. The deceased was identified as Deveshwari Devi, while her minor daughter, Preeta, 12, has been admitted in the hospital, according to district authorities.

“The accident occurred late on Monday night. The SDRF team is at the spot and the rescue operation is underway. We are also trying to find out if someone else or any cattle got hurt in the accident,” said an SDRF official.

In Pithoragarh, a woman, identified as Radha Devi, died after getting trapped under the debris. Her house in the district's Maitali village collapsed after heavy rainfall. Bhupendar Singh Mahar, district disaster management officer, told TOI that her body has been recovered. In yet another accident in the district, a woman from Jarajibli village of Pithoragarh, reportedly went missing. Search operation is underway to trace her.

Damages to public property were also reported from several villages of the district. On Monday night, Munsyari and Dharchula received 24 mm and 179 mm rainfall respectively. The rain spell blocked many internal roads in Lumti, Jarajibli, Mori, Galati, Bangapani, Baram, Chhori Bagar, Banabagar, and Galati villages.

In Jauljibi, the Kali river has swollen above the danger level, posing threat to locals. Besides, over a dozen villages got disconnected from district headquarters after an important bridge connecting Munsyari with Jauljabi was washed away in Bangapani tehsil of Pithoragarh district. “Police and rescue teams are facing problems in reaching the affected villages due to landslides and road blocks,” Mahar added.

AHMEDABAD: The Ahmedabad crime branch lodged an FIR on Tuesday against six persons of an Ahmedabad pharma company, Nilkanth Elixir, for bringing in remdesivir from Bangladesh without an import licence.

The persons booked are Vaishasli Goyani, Darshan Soni, Shekar Adroja, Path Goyani, Sandeep Mathukiya and his nephew Yash Mathukiya. The medicine is given to critical Covid-19 patients.

According to crime branch officials, the accused acquired remdesivir for Rs 5,000 per injection and sold it for Rs 18,000 in Surat and Ahmedabad.

According to crime branch officials, Yash Mathukiya would send the injections from Bangladesh through a company called Incepta Pharmaceuticals to Kolkata. From West Bengal, the injections were brought to Ahmedabad and supplied to several medical stores.

A top crime branch official said the first batch of injections were shipped to Ahmedabad on July 7. The second batch arrived on July 12. “The injections were brought to Gujarat without bills,” said a crime branch official.

“The injections were stored at a building in Makarba. During a search on Tuesday, 98 injections were recovered from the spot and they have been sent to a lab in Vadodara for analysis.”

Crime branch officials said the scam came to light when Gujarat’s Food and Drugs Control Administration found two such injections from Yash Mathukiya’s place in Surat.

333,['29/07/2020'],Rajasthan HC to hear BJP MLA’s pleas on BSP-Congress merger today,"BJP MLA Madan Dilawar

JAIPUR: BJP MLA Madan Dilawar filed two fresh petitions before the Rajasthan high court challenging the BSP-Congress merger on Tuesday. Both the petitions were listed for hearing before the single bench of Justice Mahendar Kumar Goyal on Wednesday.

The first petition challenges speaker CP Joshi’s decision on the BJP MLA’s complaint against the merger, while the second petition challenges the BSP-Congress merger as violation of Constitution’s Schedule X.

“The speaker rejected my complaint citing a technical lacuna, which is laughable. He said the copy of the speaker's decision allowing the merger that I attached with my complaint was not attested,” Dilawar told TOI. “The complaint filed in March was rejected in July on a flimsy ground even though the Supreme Court rulings say that small mistakes can be overlooked,” the BJP MLA said, adding that the speaker did not go into the merit of the matter. “The speaker rejected my complaint without giving me the opportunity to be heard. Even to get the copy of his decision I had to sit on dharna (on Monday),” Dilawar said.

Six BSP MLAs—Sandeep Yadav (Tijara), Wajib Ali (Nagar), Joginder Singh Avana (Nadbai), Deepchand Kheria (Kishangarh Bas), Lakhan Singh Meena (Karauli) and Rajendra Gudha ( Udaipurwati )—into Congress with approval from the speaker in September last year.

The BJP MLA’s lawyer Ashish Sharma said, “We have challenged the merger on legal grounds, which include violation of the constitution's Schedule X.”

The petition has prayed for disqualification of six MLAs saying that they voluntarily gave up BSP membership by seeking merger into the Congress. “As per Para (4) of Schedule X, the condition of two-third numbers to accept a merger is second condition, but the first condition is that the original party of the legislators seeking merger should have merged into the other political party. Even if all MLAs of a party decide, the merger cannot be legal until the original party decides to merge. In this case, the MLAs never claimed the BSP merged into Congress but sought only their merger into Congress,” the petition says.

Now, seeing his grit and sheer determination, several government organisations and individuals have come forward to support the former captain of Indian wheelchair cricket team, Rajendra Singh Dhami, who was forced to take up the job of a daily wage labourer to feed his family amid the pandemic.

In just two days, Dhami has received around Rs 70,000 while people across cities too have promised financial assistance. On Tuesday, a team of Pithoragarh district administration visited his house and handed over a cheque of Rs 20,000 as an immediate assistance.

TOI had in its columns on Monday published how 90% disabled Dhami, who holds a postgraduate degree and has won numerous awards in the cricketing field, was forced to take up the job of a daily wage labourer under the employment guarantee scheme after his income as a coach dried up due to the pandemic. Both state and district authorities took cognisance of the report and have promised aid to the disabled cricketer .

Based on the directions of Pithoragarh district magistrate VK Jogdande, district sports officer Sanjeev Pauri and general manager of district industries centre Kavita Bhagat visited Dhami at his residence in Raikot village and handed over a cheque of Rs 20,000 under the aegis of the district sports committee. The DM is the chairman of the committee. Bhagat said that they have offered assistance to him under the chief minister self-employment scheme too, an initiative meant to help people returning to the state due to the pandemic. She added that he has expressed interest in rearing goats and further steps would be taken for the same after processing his application.

Meanwhile, Uttarakhand Olympic Association general secretary DK Singh said that the committee would give Rs 50,000 to Dhami.

TOI has learned that individuals from Delhi, Dehradun and Pithoragarh among others have also promised financial assistance to the cricketer.

Expressing happiness, Dhami said, “I am grateful and indebted to all those who have helped me. I spoke to DM Jogdande over the phone and he has promised me employment. That is a big relief.”

Sharma, who has been suspended from the party, is one of the 19 MLAs now camping in Haryana’s Manesar seeking a change of leadership of chief minister Ashok Gehlot . The ruling Congress had released audio tapes in which Sharma was heard purportedly talking to middleman Sanjay Jain and Union minister Gajendra Singh Shekhawat about plans to topple the Gehlot government by horse-trading of MLAs.

Following the release of the video, Congress chief whip Mahesh Joshi had approached the SOG seeking an investigation of the alleged conspiracy.

SOG has filed two FIRs in the case on the basis of the audio tapes under a section dealing with for sedition and criminal conspiracy. Jain has been arrested in this case while SOG has issued a notice to Union minister Shekhawat and Sharma. Though the SOG has been looking for Sharma, the MLA has so far managed to evade arrest.

We have a date in mind: 5th September. It is the birth anniversary of (Sarvepalli) Radhakrishnan and we might resume classes on that date. Then we can continue till the Pujas on alternate days but everything depends on the situation.” The ministry of human resource development had on July 17 asked state governments to provide them with a feedback from school students’ parents about when would they be comfortable with schools reopening: August, September or October.Banerjee reiterated no exams could be held in colleges now and that the earlier UGC advisory to appraise students on their earlier semesters should be followed. “We need to think about students,” she said.Responding to the possibility of schools reopening in September, Ram Mohan Mission School principal Sujoy Biswas said the seating arrangements would have to be re-organised to ensure social distancing. “An orientation programme will have to be held, where students will be asked to carry sanitizers and two sets of napkins and face masks that can be changed.

Dr Praveen Gantawar, working as additional medical officer with Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) and his wife Dr Sheelu, moved HC apprehending arrest in the case registered against them at Sitabuldi police station under the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988.

While allowing their application for interim bail, justice Vinay Joshi directed them to furnish a PR bond amounting to Rs25,000 with sureties of a similar amount and also to meet officials of the investigation agency every Monday and Thursday between 3 and 5pm. They were told not to move outside NMC limits and also to give their passports to the agency. They were warned against any inducement, threat or promise to any person acquainted with the facts of the case.

Through counsel Prasad Abhyankar the duo contended that the ACB officers had wrongly calculated their income and expenditure and by manipulating figures, a false case of disproportionate assets was lodged. They argued that the auditor’s report has been partially accepted to suit the purpose of FIR.

The ACB had alleged that the doctor couple accumulated disproportionate assets amounting to Rs2.52 crore which is 43.06% more than their legal/known sources of income.

A representation regarding this was made by Gujarat Traders’ Federation (GTF), before the CEO of Food Safety and Standards Authorities of India (FSSAI). “The country is still reeling under a pandemic-like situation caused due to Covid-19 and several districts are under lockdown or restrictive working hours. Moreover, the renewal of FSSAI licence involves submitting of documents personally to the local authorities.

The SOG has also replaced its team to keep up the pressure on the MLA whose name had cropped up in alleged attempts to topple the government.

Singh said, “As the SOG investigation progresses, I will write to DGP Haryana and Delhi Police commissioner again requesting assistance to our team there which is probing the matter.”

On July 18, Singh had written to the top cops requesting the same though there was no response, sources have said. On Tuesday, the SOG recorded the statement of one of the witnesses, Tanveer Singh, who was sent a notice on July 22. He was a witness of the discussion between Ashok Singh and Bharat Malani who were arrested for talking about horse-trading of MLAs. Their mobile phones were put on surveillance on June 13 after the SOG learnt from a source that the duo might be linked to a mafia dealing in arms and explosives.

Police officers investigating the case heard the duo’s conversations on politics and after gathering information for nearly a month lodged the FIR on Friday.

342,['29/07/2020'],PIL wants use of loudspeakers for azaan banned at mosques in Gujarat,"The PIL contends that the sound from the loudspeaker is very loud and is unbearable.

AHMEDABAD: A Gandhinagar-based doctor has filed a PIL in the Gujarat high court seeking a ban on use of loudspeakers for the azaan (call to prayer) at mosques across Gujarat contending that it creates noise pollution and violates the fundamental rights of citizens.

Dharmendra Prajapati, a resident of Sector 5C in Gandhinagar, complained that even though not many persons turn up to pray at the mosque in his neighbourhood, the muezzin uses a loudspeaker five times a day to recite the azaan. This causes great inconvenience and disturbance to the people living nearby. He contended that people have a right to peace and tranquility.

Basing the arguments on the Allahabad high court’s order with regard to denial of permission recite the azaan on loudspeakers against the local authorities’ decision during the lockdown, the petitioner stated that he complained about this to the local authority but to no effect.

The PIL contends that the sound from the loudspeaker is very loud and is unbearable. Such noise pollution “causes severe mental illness, physical problems to aged persons and small children and it also affects the work efficiency of the public at large. In short, it is not good for health”.

Citing legal provisions, the PIL claims that use of loudspeaker without permission from local authorities violates the law. “There is no valid written permission obtained by the persons of Muslim community while using loudspeaker while offering prayers,” the PIL reads. It also cited an order by the Supreme Court to assert that no religion prescribes that prayers should be performed by disturbing the peace of others nor does it preach that they should be through voice amplifiers or beating of drums.

The petitioner further claimed that use of loudspeakers is not an integral part of Islam because in the olden days when the technology did not exist, the azaan was recited and namaz used to be offered regularly in mosques. Muslims cannot explain why namaz cannot take place without the azaan through a loudspeaker.

The petitioner further argued that the use of the loudspeaker five times a day disturbs people’s sleep and students’ education. “Sleep is a fundamental and basic requirement without which the existence of life itself would be in peril. To disturb sleep, therefore, would amount to torture which is not accepted as a violation of human right,” the PIL says.

The PIL is likely to come up for hearing later this week.

344,['29/07/2020'],HC again rejects Saibaba’s bail plea,"Nagpur: For a second time, the Nagpur bench of Bombay High Court on Wednesday rejected bail application of Naxal ideologue GN Saibaba. Earlier, it was rejected on March 25 last year. The bench, however, directed jail officials to expeditiously consider his new application for parole filed on June 16 on merits.

The wheelchair bound Delhi University professor applied for bail apprehending he may get infected with the coronavirus that hundreds of inmates and jail officials contracted inside the jail. Through counsel Nihalsingh Rathod, he also cited his deteriorating health and his mother’s cancer due to which she needs him in Hyderabad.

The petition was strongly opposed by Gadchiroli police through special public prosecutor Prashant Sathianathan contending that since the petitioner was lodged in the Anda Cell, there’s hardly any chance of getting infected from deadly virus. Moreover, his application for parole to meet his mother on the same grounds was rejected recently.

Quoting the jail’s chief medical officer (CMO), a division bench of Justices Atul Chandurkar and Amit Borkar stated that appropriate medical aid was being provided to Saibaba.

“From CMO’s reply, it is clear that all precautions are being taken to stop Covid-19 spread inside prison. The petitioner has been kept in a separate high security cell where inmates aren’t permitted to interact with others. It is also found he was tested for Covid-19 and report was negative. Moreover, only staff testing negative are kept on duty.”

Adding that there was no reason to disbelieve CMO’s report, the judges said though Saibaba suffered from various ailments, they did not find any ground to release him on bail due to pandemic.

“Regarding his worsening medical condition, we find that except for narrating his ailments, no further details are given. While arriving at this conclusion, we have kept in mind the nature of accusations against him, his conviction by Gadchiroli sessions court and rejection of his application for suspension of sentence by HC earlier,” they said.

345,['29/07/2020'],Cantonment hospital in Kamptee awaits Covid-19 testing kits,"Nagpur: After a woman staffer, two more persons living in the military engineering services (MES) quarters in Kamptee cantonment tested Covid positive on Monday. These include a staffer and his wife. They have been sent to the Covid care centre at Waregaon near Kamptee.

Sources said samples of another 15-20 persons living in the quarters have been sent for tests. Apart from it, close to 20 army personnel were also undergoing treatment at the military hospital by last week, with close to an equal number already cured.

The person who tested positive said that initially his wife had a fever and was taken to a private hospital at Kamptee. The doctor asked them to get a Covid test done if they had a doubt. “We straightaway went for the tests and were found positive,” he said.

The cantonment area has a military hospital for the uniformed personnel and a cantonment hospital for others residing in the area. However, till Tuesday, no medical kits were available at the hospitals. There were demands from the civilian residents of the cantonment for providing the kits.

Arvind Hingne, the tehsildar for Kamptee, said that a demand of 4,000 kits had been put up as the equipment was to be supplied to private doctors too. When TOI called up the officer at around 4pm, he said the kits are expected to be delivered on Tuesday and were awaited.

Kamptee has two more government hospitals outside the cantonment where both rapid antigen and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RTPCR) tests are conducted. Currently, any civilian suspected to have Covid has to approach any of the two centres outside the cantonment

“The cantonment has a population of around 4,000 civilians alone, apart from defence personnel. Earlier, there were issues over getting the tests done in the hospitals outside. Some of the patients said that the hospital in the town did not cover the cantonment residents, though the issue was sorted out later,” said a resident.

Going out of the cantonment is also a hassle as clearance from the doctors has to be taken for such cases. In the normal course, the movement is only allowed during Mondays and Thursdays, the resident said.

“The army has a military hospital of 57-bed facility and there is not Covid testing facility. The samples taken are sent to the Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH) for testing,” said defence spokesperson Wing Commander Basant Kumar Pande.

TOWN ON TENTERHOOKS

* 4,000 kits have been demanded for Kamptee

347,['29/07/2020'],"Many MLAs don’t want to head boards, corporations","CM BS Yediyurappa

BENGALURU: A day after chief minister BS Yediyurappa appointed 24 MLAs heads of various boards and corporations , at least nine legislators have reportedly expressed reservations in accepting the offer.

While MLAs GH Thippareddy, MP Kumaraswamy and Preetham Gowda have openly said they will not accept their new responsibility, MLAs Narasimha Nayak, Rajkumar Patil Telkur, Siddu Savadi, Nehru Olekar, Kalakappa Bandi and SS Patil Nadahalli have reportedly expressed displeasure over being appointed to boards and corporations.

Though a majority of them said they preferred development of their constituencies instead of helming boards and corporations , the real reason is the realisation that they stand no chance to become ministers if they accept the present offer as most of them are eyeing cabinet berths. Many also see these appointments as beneath their status.

“Why do I need such a big post. Let the chief minister appoint someone else. I don’t have any ambition to move around in a government vehicle. I am happy if the CM gives more funds to my constituency,” said Kumaraswamy who has been appointed chairman of Karnataka Marketing Consultants and Agencies Limited. A three-time MLA from Mudigere, Kumaraswamy has boycotted the first cabinet expansion in protest.

Thippareddy, who has been very vocal about his ambition to become minister, has outrightly rejected his appointment as chairman of the D Devaraj Urs Backward Classes Development Corporation. He has reportedly told the CM that he would prefer to remain an MLA rather than accepting anything less than a cabinet berth.

Preetham Gowda said he was not mentally prepared to accept the offer as he wants to focus on development of his constituency. “Yediyurappa has given me full freedom as far as Hassan district administration is concerned. I am like the CM of Hassan now and I want to continue like this,” he added.

Narasimha Nayak, who’s also lobbying for a cabinet berth, said he will meet Yediyurappa before taking a call on accepting his appointment as chairman of Karnataka State Urban Water Supply and Drainage Board. Dattatreya Patil, another ministerial berth aspirant, said he would accept whatever responsibility the party gives him. He has been appointed chairman of Kalyana Karnataka Area Development Board.

Though none of the MLAs who rejected the appointments has shown any sign of rebellion, their decision will definitely make things more difficult for the CM and the BJP when they decide to finalise names for cabinet expansion. Yediyurappa is expected to expand the cabinet in the first week of August to fill six vacant berths, for which there are over a dozen aspirants, including senior most MLA Umesh Katti. There are rumours that he may even go for a cabinet rejig by dropping some ministers to make way for fresh faces.

348,['29/07/2020'],"Dehradun’s tap water fails to meet standards, not safe to drink","Dehradun: A recently-released survey report has revealed that the tap water supplied in several localities of Dehradun district do not meet the safety standards and is unfit for consumption. The survey, conducted by Dehradun-based Society of Pollution and Environmental Conservation Scientists (SPECS), tested water samples of 125 localities across the Dehradun district between June 10, 2020 and July 10, 2020.

The report says that the tap water supplied in 65% of the 125 surveyed localities across the Dehradun district has the presence of fecal coliform which is a major contributor in causing stomach diseases. The study also highlights that the amount of absorbed chlorine in the tap water was below the prescribed level in several localities. This can cause skin diseases, the report points out.

Dr Brij Mohan Sharma from SPECS told TOI, “The water contamination levels in these localities are alarming. The presence of fecal coliform indicates that people are consuming water which has the presence of waste from underground sewage. If the people continue to consume such poor quality water for a long time, it can result in severe illness as well.”

The study has further revealed that the tap water supplied in certain areas — including Rajpur, Johri village, Doon Vihar, Malsi, Vijaypur Road, DL Road, and Niranjanpur — have a high presence of hard water contents. Notably, hard water is also responsible for causing problems like hair loss, skin dryness, among others.

In more than 36 localities from where the water samples were collected, the absorbed chlorine levels were found to be below the prescribed norms. “If contaminated water is consumed regularly, one may become prone to Gastroenteritis, flu, diarrhoea, chronic fever, cough, sleep disorders, malaria, and dengue. A large number of poisonous substances enter our body through contaminated water affecting our health adversely. These poisonous substances in water prominently include cadmium, lead, mercury, arsenic and nickel added,” Dr Sharma.

The residents too have expressed their concern over the poor water quality of tap water being supplied in Dehradun. Vijay Kothiyal, a resident of Tilak Road area, said, “We are paying water tax to the government for providing us safe drinking water but what we are getting is not at all fit for drinking.”

Another resident from the Mobbeywala area, Imran Hasan, said, “We often get tap water which looks murkier and also has a foul smell. We have to clean it several times before consuming it.”

Meanwhile, Yashbir Mal, executive engineer at Jal Sansthan, said “We carry out tests to check the water quality at regular intervals and tests are conducted at our specialised lab. We cannot verify the quality of the tests conducted by any other organisation.”

349,['29/07/2020'],CBSE to give schools leeway for affiliation extension,"Nagpur: CBSE has decided to extend affiliation of applicant schools without waiting for the physical inspection report due to various restrictions in travel and school reopening currently in place. Schools need the affiliation extension to be processed quickly as other formalities like admissions etc depend on it.

The board’s secretary Anurag Tripathi in a circular issued earlier this month confirmed that this step was being taken due to the current pandemic. Tripathi wrote, “It is observed that the inspection of schools that had applied for extension has been held up due to the current Covid-19 situation in which schools are not functional. However, schools are pressing hard for extension of affiliation as they have to take further approval from the state education department/other govt authorities to ensure normal functioning”.

The central board has classified such applicant schools into two categories. First are those where the physical inspection is due, and second, those whose inspection is done but final report by committee members is pending. With no inspection being done now, CBSE will extend affiliation based on inputs submitted online by the school. Tripathi clarified that the onus will be on schools to ensure that only facts are presented.

Schools that have received letters citing deficiencies noticed during inspection have to comply before the extension is granted. Tripathi wrote, “Cases where the inspection committee is constituted shall be required to submit compliance against deficiencies communicated”.

While it’s expected that the compliance by schools and the ensuing affiliation inspection will be in good faith, CBSE has warned against misrepresentation of facts. “The onus of genuineness of the data/ documents/ information provided by the schools shall be of the school for all purposes” wrote Tripathi.

After having banned exports of textile raw materials used to make surgical, disposable masks and coveralls in March, the directorate general of foreign trade (DGFT) allowed export of non-woven fabric on July 13. However, the curbs on exports of non-woven fabric with density of 25-70GSM (gram per square meter) were continued allegedly on concerns of availability of this fabric for manufacturing masks and personal protective equipment (PPE).

“Majority of demand in export market pertain to spunbond non-woven fabric of 25-70GSM and restrictions on its exports is hurting domestic industry,” said Suresh Patel, president, NWFI. Spunbond non-woven fabric is manufactured from fibre grade plypropalene granules using spun-bond technology. The fabric is used for making surgical/isolation gowns, drapes, facemasks, shoe covers and caps.

Allaying fears about the availability of this fabric for masks and PPEs, Anshumali Jain, vice-president, NWFI, said, “Out of 41,350 metric tonnes (MT) of total monthly production capacity, only 5,221 MT or 13% is used for medical application, which also includes making PPE kit, 3-ply masks and N95 masks. There is surplus capacity availability in India.”

“These figures show that the country is self-sufficient in spunbond nonwoven fabric. Hence, the restrictions on its export do not make any practical sense,” he added.

According to NWFI general secretary Nikesh Shah, the curbs on exports and surplus supply in domestic market has led to reduction in manufacturers’ capacity utilisation to 30% currently, which was around 90% before the pandemic.

354,['29/07/2020'],Pond-like craters turn Belgharia Expressway into a death trap,"A large crater on the Dunlop underpass on Belgharia Expressway

KOLKATA: Massive potholes on a nearly 600m stretch of the Dunlop underpass on the Dakshineswar-bound flank of Belgharia Expressway have virtually turned the subway into a death trap for motorists and bikers, with multiple accidents being reported from there.

At Baranagar’s Niranjan Sen Nagar bus stand , close to the CCR Bridge-Belgharia Expressway intersection and barely 1.5km from Dunlop crossing, there is a crater as big as a pond. Subal Saha, owner of a nearby tea stall, claimed the crater was at least two-and-a-half-months old. “The potholes started forming since mid-May, but no repair has been done. With monsoon arriving, the craters widened, leading to waterlogging. The area stays under water for days and vehicles headed for Dakshineswar, Dunlop, Baranagar and Belgharia have to slow down, manoeuvring it,” Saha said, adding he had seen several accidents and breakdowns at that crater.

The Dakshineswar-bound stretch of Belgharia Expressway is perhaps at its worst at Belghoria’s Satinsennagar and Rajibnagar, Indira Cololy, Niranjan Pally and Niranjan Sen Nagar in Baranagar. The bad condition of the road adds to the snarls. Sudipta Mukherjee, a real estate developer and a resident of Belgharia’s Udaypur, said they faced jams regularly on the expressway during peak hours.

But Biswajit Mahato, DCP (traffic), Barrackpore Commissionerate , said they had written to NHA. “We are trying to fill the craters somehow,” Mahato told TOI.

356,['29/07/2020'],Non-judicial stamp paper: Pleas junked,"Ahmedabad: The Gujarat high court quashed all six petitions challenging the state government’s decision to do away with physical use of non-judicial stamp papers and shifting to e-stamping last year.

The HC quoted Greek philosopher Heraclitus’s statement “The only constant in life is change” to uphold the progression due to advanced technology and evolution of law as well.

In September 2019, the government introduced 8A of the Sales Rules thereby shifting the duty payment procedure to electronic mode from papers. The challenge to this decision was on the ground of law as well as on practicality that various stamp vendors were rendered jobless.

The HC took into notice consideration the Centre’s decision to make the stamp duty collection system foolproof after the Telgi stamp paper scam.

It also discussed seven security features in the electronic mode of stamping for duty payment. It also noticed that stamp vendors have not lost work but of 1,559 licensed vendors, 1,021 applied for licences as authorized collection centres.

Moreover, the HC said that the law relating to stamp duty in Gujarat has undergone changes periodically. Franking was introduced in 1999 and in 2007 receipt challans or certificates were issued under the e-stamping system.

Now, there is the elimination of non-judicial physical stamp paper and “a new era in this field of law has been ushered and this is a classic example of how law and evolution go hand in hand”.

The HC also said that the litigation “has given us the opportunity of scanning the anatomy of a provision with the lens of pragmatism and has further enabled us to examine how law responds to the needs of the society and how law has been proactive in embracing advancement in technology.”

The court imposed the condition in a sedition case after he was arrested on a court warrant for his continued absence from the trial and was released on bail in January. He is facing sedition charges along with his former associates in the Patidar Anamad Andolan Saminit (PAAS), who were booked and arrested in 2015, after violence took place during the Patidar quota stir.

Patel had requested the court to lift the restriction on the day he was elevated by the Congress to the post of working president in the state.

Chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan said the situation in the state capital is highly sensitive as more and more contact cases are being reported. “It is spreading wildly in different areas. In tests conducted at the Kinfra Park in Menmakulam, nearly 88 persons tested positive, which shows the gravity of the situation,’’ he said.

If one in every 36 persons tested are turning positive in the state, in Thiruvananthapuram the ratio is 1:18. The first cluster in the district was reported on July 5 at Poonthura.

PUNE: Technical support to parents, homeroom teacher assistance if students are unable to attend live sessions, planning lessons keeping in mind every age group’s attention span are among the many standard operating procedures that the city schools affiliated to the International Baccalaureate (IB) board have adopted in their online teaching.

The board has provided schools in the city with podcasts to handle remote learning for children and efficiently teach the curriculum.

President of Victorious Kidss Educares (VKE), Robbin Ghosh, said the IT cell’s contact is provided so that both the students and the teachers can seek technical help.

“The homeroom teacher’s number is also provided for assistance if any student cannot attend a session. So, VKE uses simple apps connected easily irrespective of the platform a smartphone or a computer uses. Apps like Google Classrooms, Managebac and ERP are really helping us stay connected through live streaming, pre-recorded videos of flipped and physical classrooms,” he said.

According to the principal of Indus International School , Sandeep Chhabra , a start-up cell has been established by the school wherein the parent entrepreneurs are helping students work on ideas. Studetns are mentored by parents already into businesses or those who are entrepreneurs.

The school has adopted the interdisciplinary inquiry resources for students to complete the inquiry independently, each task also includes suggestions of how teachers may facilitate their learning.

Mohita Das, a teacher at an IB school, said, “IB’s continuity of plan for emergency learning has put forth teaching guidelines keeping in mind the transitions of students from one type of learning (traditional, physical classroom environment) to another (digitized, virtual environment).”

The programme has lakhs of students in 125 countries.

PUNE: Savitribai Phule Pune University is ready to roll out online classes for all non-first year batches whose results have been declared from August 5.

An integrated online platform for affiliated colleges has been developed by the university. Each lecture is 250-350MB.

There will be quizzes after every 10 minutes or after every lecture so that students do not log in and then skip lectures.

No student can go ahead with the next part of the lecture series without getting some percentage of the answers right.

The centralised system will ensure that university officials will know how many lectures a college has completed and how many students have attended them.

Vice chancellor Nitin Karmalkar said professors have been told to give short audio-video clips wherein they explain a topic. They also need to email us three-four points about the objective of the clip, expected learning level of the student after listening to the clip, and a possibility of graphics.

“The clip is reviewed by our team, compressed, questions are inserted, sometimes graphics are inserted and then sent to the professor for a review following which it is uploaded. We are also building a bibliography so that we do not just give the link of suggested reading material but have downloaded the relevant topics for students to go through,” he said.

Teachers are being trained in developing e-content so that they can insert questions, modify the content, make a module.

“At present, we are looking at 40% of the syllabus being taught online and 60% when the colleges reopen. A class of 100 students will be divided into four batches and each batch will come per week when the colleges reopen. After their classroom lectures, each batch will get at least two weeks in home quarantine. During this time, they can access the online material,” Karmalkar said.

Every student and teacher has a login ID and password. The university will monitor at any time how much content a student or teacher has covered.

“Students often complain that they were given admission and exams were conducted within 10 days. We can cross-check it now from the system,” Karmalkar said.

Sanjay Chakane, principal of Arts, Science Commerce College in Indapur , one of the 10 colleges piloting this project, said their teachers are trained in making the module and they can insert graphics and questions.

“The formative assessment model will be used in this online module to check progress. We tried it for BA students and it was a smooth process. We plan to start the online classes by August 5 or 6 for the first batch of students who would have taken admission by then,” he added.

""If there is a student in region with no internet or phone range, then the student can even take the module on a pen drive or download it from a nearest centre, "" said Karmalkar.

SPPU is not charging any funds for this platform from the college but this year the varsity will not be disbursing funds to colleges for buying sports equipment etc, he added.

""Our effort is to reach those colleges which are not the so called rich colleges and do not have money to build their own platforms. They can use this ready made module. We are also training the teachers to do this, "" added Karmalkar.

Prajakt Tanpure, state minister of higher education said, ""SPPU has put up a good infrastructure for online teaching learning process. All universities in the state are trying to reach its students through online processes. As and when we find different problems, solutions would be found,"" he said.

The rapid survey was undertaken in 276 ATMs across the state during the period of July 24-27 in the context of the spread of Covid-19.Many of the ATMs have empty sanitizer bottles and are also littered with the same. In some ATMs, very small sanitizer bottles are kept and in others it is kept in an inconspicuous manner, the survey report said.Posters/notices with the instructions to sanitize hands before and after every cash transaction is displayed only in 40% ATMs. Only one-third of the ATMs have provided these instructions in Malayalam. No direction is provided in Kannada and Tamil in the ATMs visited in Karnataka and Tamil Nadu border regions.One-third of the total ATMs in Kerala belong to State Bank of India (SBI). However, sanitizer was available only in less than half of the SBI ATMs surveyed. Kerala-based private sector banks wage better in this regard (70%). In the case of other private and public sector banks, only half of their ATMs have sanitizer facilities.It is also found that the availability of sanitizer is considerably better in the ATMs installed near the bank branches . While in two-thirds of such ATMs, sanitization facilities are properly available, the same is available in 38% of standalone ATMs. “This difference may be because it is easier for the bank staff to re-fill/replace sanitizer bottles in the ATMs installed near the bank branches. However, it also points to the fact that banks need to specifically provide more attention to ensure sanitization facilities in standalone ATMs,” the report said.The survey also found that the availability of sanitization facilities in ATMs is worse in panchayats and municipalities.

PUNE: State minister for higher and technical education Prajakt Tanpure on Tuesday said that the fee structure of colleges would be reviewed and some guidelines issued soon.

He was at the Savitribai Phule Pune University to review its online education platform.

Many students have taken to the social media to question why they must pay fees for gymkhana, library, laboratory, educational trips and the mess when they would not be using any of these facilities this semester. They have also sought a concession in tuition fee as they are not using any of the college infrastructure.

Thousands of students from the rural parts study in cities where they live in hostels and dine at the mess.

On the final-year examination, the minister said they were waiting for a speedy verdict from the court.

“We understand that students are going through problems. Many have worked hard all these years, and many have their placement letters but are unable to join the workplace as they need their final year marksheet, those who would now look for jobs, once they get their final year marksheet, are facing uncertainty. We are hoping to get a verdict from the courts soon,” he said.

Tanpure said the government does not want to declare a date for the Common Entrance Test and postpone it.

""We are trying to conduct it in as many talukas as possible so that students do not have to travel long distances. However, taking the score of other exams or not conducting the CET or considering class XII marks for qualification is not fair to students who work hard for the CET,"" he added.

NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court was surprised to learn on Tuesday that CBI deputy superintendent of police A K Bassi, who had sided with then director A K Verma in his feud with then special director Rakesh Asthana , had not reported to Port Blair, where he was transferred more than one-and-a-half years ago.

A bench of Chief Justice S A Bobde and Justices A S Bopanna and V Ramasubramanian asked, “How can you not join your place of posting?” His counsel Rajeev Dhavan said Bassi had challenged his “illegal” transfer to Port Blair and the court in January last year had asked him to approach the authorities against the transfer. Dhavan went on to say that the transfer order, which was once kept suspended, was revived by the order of the CBI director, ignoring the letter and spirit of the Supreme Court order.

The bench said, “Unless the transfer order is set aside by a court of law or appropriate forum, that order subsists. Even if according to you the order is illegal, you have to move a competent forum to set it aside. There is no order from the Supreme Court which said you need not join your post in Port Blair.”

When Dhavan pleaded that Bassi had personal and domestic problems, the bench said, “We do not see any protection given to you from transfer by the Supreme Court. And what is this personal and domestic exigency that you will not join your place of posting in Port Blair? If you so wish, you can challenge it in an appropriate forum.”

Dhavan said, “I understand the Supreme Court has compulsions against hearing this petition...My client will challenge the transfer order before the Central Administrative Tribunal .” The bench allowed him to withdraw the petition while saying, “Sorry, we cannot help you in this petition.”

LUCKNOW: Before the demolition of Babri Masjid, the then prime minister Narasimha Rao had asked Gujarat-based chief architect of the Ram temple project , Chandrakantbhai Sompura, if the mosque, too, could be the part of the plan and both the Babri Masjid and the Ram Temple could stand next to one another? As per 77-year-old Sompura, Rao had sought his opinion hinting that the mosque could remain where it was and if the temple could be constructed from beyond the Ram Chabutra . But the seed of the idea could not be sown, as the Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) opposed such a plan.

""The PM called me up directly and asked if the mosque with its three iconic domes could be part of the design along with the temple. I communicated the idea to VHP, who had roped me in for the project, but VHP vehemently opposed it and the idea got buried in time,"" Sompura told TOI over phone from Ahmedabad.

""The VHP was adamant that if the 6 feet by 3 feet space of the khatiya (bed) where Bhagwan Ram was born is not the centre of the Ram Mandir, then it wouldn't matter where the temple comes up then. Ram Mandir had to be built at the very spot where the structure (mosque) was as they believed Lord Ram was born in the area right under the central dome,"" he added.

Chandrakantbhai Sompura, whose grandfather had designed and refurbished Gujarat's Somnath temples among several other temples in the country also recalled to TOI his first meeting with VHP head and in charge of the Ram Mandir movement, Ashok Singhal.

“I was approached by Ashok Singhal because of the many Birla temples I had designed all over the country. He contacted me through someone from there and we first met in Delhi where he proposed the Ayodhya project,"" said Sompura who has been involved with the project for over 30 years now.

Singhal and Sompura then went together to Ayodhya to examine the disputed site. ""There was a lot of fencing, huge walls barricading off the structure. I was not given permission to take my equipment and tape for measuring the area and I had to use the age-old method of measuring with the foot,"" he added.

Sompura, then in his 40s, took long strides to measure the area of the mosque by his feet. “I remember it was a space of 80 feet by 40 feet inside the mosque and I had to adjust a few feet by experience, since there was no measuring tape. Rest of the area had huge walls,"" said the chief architect, whose two sons Nikhil and Ashish Sompura, now help their aged father with the project related traveling, especially during the pandemic.

In the next six months after this episode, Sompura had the Ram Mandir design all ready and approved in the first go. The design remained unchanged for 30 years up until now with the new addition of an even grander Ram Mandir.

Bablu and Vikas were playing along with their friends near the toilet when the wall collapsed on them all of sudden and they were buried under debris. Both the children were rushed to a community health centre, where doctors pronounced Bablu dead upon arrival, while Vikas was referred to the district hospital after administering first aid.

“It has been raining heavily for the past a few days and a portion of the toilet that was left incomplete due to the lockdown collapsed,” said a schoolteacher who wished not to be named.

Basic shiksha adhikari Budhpriya Singh said, “I have asked the block education officer to probe the incident and find out the person responsible for the death.”

Neemgaon police station SHO Amar Singh told TOI, “The body was sent for autopsy. The family has demanded action against the contractor who built the toilet, but we are yet to receive a written complaint in this connection. The other boy is stable and undergoing treatment at the district hospital.”

This is the second death of a minor in a wall collapse incident in the district. On June 20, a 10-year-old boy was buried alive under debris of the boundary wall of a school.

The crime was committed in Datauli village under Jiathra police limit.

Based on a written complaint by the girl’s father, police initially lodged an FIR of kidnapping against unknown person, but later arrested five and charged them with murder. The accused were identified as Vineeta, Aman Thakur, Karun, Budhpal and Kalicharan.

According to police, Hirdesh Gupta, father of the girl identified as Kinjal, recently had a confrontation with his three cousins after he found his niece Vineeta along with Aman Thakur. Police said that the family felt insulted and plotted the murder to avenge this. Later, they abducted his three-year-old daughter on Monday,killed her and hid the body, police said.

Etah superintendent of police Sunil Kumar Singh said, “Budhpal, Karun and Kalicharan were awarded life sentence in 2002 for a murder they had committed in 1997. However, all three were out on bail. Last week they engaged in a scuffle with Hirdesh. Taking it as an insult to the family, the accused hatched a plan to take revenge.”

“On Monday morning, Vineeta took Kinjal to her home on the pretext of giving her some snacks. However, as soon as she brought the victim inside her house, she along with Aman Thakur, Karun, Budhpal and Kalicharan strangled her and hid her body in the house. Two hours later, when Hirdesh came to Vineeta’s home searching for his daughter, he was informed that Kinjal left for home. The family searched for her for several hours. Later, the conspiracy was unearthed,” the SP added.

He said, “All the five were arrested on Tuesday and the victim’s body was recovered. The autopsy confirmed strangulation as the cause of her death.”

The victim was reportedly advised to take a bath in the river by a priest after completing a ‘havan’ near the river at the Majhgai range of the reserve.

The incident occurred at around 5 pm on Monday. The body of Rinkesh Kumar was recovered nearly two kilometres from the incident spot and sent for autopsy on Tuesday.

According to DTR officials, the crocodile had dragged the youth into deep water while his disabled father restlessly shouted for help.

The other members of the family immediately alerted the forest department and a rescue operation was initiated, but it was suspended due to sunset. The body was then recovered on Tuesday morning. Officials have found deep wounds on the neck and shoulder.

“We have already informed local villagers about the presence of crocodiles in the river but they still performed rituals near the river and even took a bath, risking their life. Compensation, in this case, is highly unlikely, as the incident was reported in the reserve forest area. The revenue department will decide whether to award compensation under the State Calamity Act or not,” field director of DTR, Sanjay Pathak said.

380,['29/07/2020'],"Without pollution, we could live for 10+ years: Report","Lucknow: Have you ever considered how much longer you could live if you were breathing in clean air? A Lucknow resident could add 10.3 years to his life if WHO guidelines on particulate matter in the air are met.

This is the the maximum number of years in the entire country that can be added to a person’s life by cutting down on PM2.5 pollutants in the air as per pollution data of 2018.

The conclusion was drawn by data churned out by the Air Quality Life Index (AQLI) webtool developed by the Energy Policy Institute at the University of Chicago (EPIC). The report was released on Tuesday.

As per AQLI, Lucknow tops the chart in India with 10.3 years which could be added to a citizen’s life. It was followed by Delhi with 9.4 years and Kanpur with 9 years, if WHO’s safe exposure levels are followed.

This also means that in Lucknow, concentration of PM 2.5 was higher than that of Delhi in 2018.

WHO sets reduction of PM2.5 concentration from 35g/m3 to 10g/m3 as a safe level of exposure.

The method has been developed by EPIC director Michael Greenstone and is rooted in peer reviewed research co-authored by him. It converts particulate air pollution into its impact on life expectancy.

If data from AQLI is believed, then a quarter of India’s population is exposed to pollution levels not seen in any other country. The nearly 200 million residents of Uttar Pradesh are losing more than 8 years of life expectancy according to WHO’s guideline.

Within UP, the tool measures increase in life expectancy of residents of Rae Bareli by 9.9 years, Amethi by 9.8 years, Bulandshahr by 9.8 years and Kanpur by 9 years. Jhansi and Lalitpur at the lower rung of the data ladder with relatively lower levels of PM 2.5, can add 5 and 4 years respectively to the life of their residents if WHO guidelines are met.

“Though the threat of coronavirus is grave and deserves every bit of the attention it is receiving—perhaps more in some places—embracing the seriousness of air pollution with a similar vigour would allow billions of people around the world to lead longer and healthier lives,” said Michael Greenstone, the Milton Friedman distinguished service professor of economics and creator of AQLI. He added that in India, the solution lies in robust public policy.

The index is based on the diseases and harm air pollution can cause to the human body. Air pollution’s deadly effects on the heart, lungs, and other systems have a more devastating impact on life expectancy than communicable diseases like tuberculosis and HIV/AIDS, behavioural killers like cigarette smoking, and even war, the report said. PM2.5 penetrates deep into the lungs, bypassing the body’s natural defences. From there, these tiny particles can enter the bloodstream, causing lung disease, cancer, stroke and heart attack, it added.

If the BBMP wants our support, let them provide us with trained staff.”BBMP commissioner N Manjunatha Prasad, during the council meeting on Tuesday, indicated that help from private hospitals is vital. “There are many hospitals which have adequate beds with ventilator and oxygen support and we need their support in handling the Covid-19 challenge,” Prasad said.However, hospitals say they have problems of their own.

Baljeet sought police intervention but to no avail, he said, adding that is when he tried to end his life.

Jai Prakash Yadav, superintendent of police, said the dispute was to be resolved by the revenue authorities. The police had already sent the report concerned to the district magistrate on June 23.

MUMBAI: Your housing societies can collect a fine of Rs 1000 from you if you are found not wearing the face mask inside the society premises.

In a first such directive, the office of assistant registrar of cooperatives department (S Ward) has directed housing societies under its jurisdiction to impose penalty on those not wearing the mask inside society premises.

The letter issued by the registrar, copy of which is with TOI, pointed out that BMC had already made social distancing and face mask mandatory at public places. BMC has also made a provision to impose fine of Rs 1000 on those breaching face-mask norm, it added.

""The management committee needs to get the approval of the general / special general meeting to take any punitive action against the concerned for refusing to use the mask despite the request of the office bearers of the organization. However, due to the essays on Covid 19, the organization is unable to convene a general meeting / special general meeting. And there is no provision in the law for holding general meetings by video conferencing. It is also not possible for the officials of the organization to lodge a complaint with the police station every time against the irresponsible residents concerned. Therefore, they have requested for instructions in this regard from the office level,"" the letter by Rajesh Lovekar, assistant registrar, coopertive societies, S-Division said while explaining the reason behind issuing of the directive.

Even as the Supreme Court is yet to hear special leave petitions filed by Goa, Karnataka and Maharashtra in the Mhadei water diversion case, the Karnataka state cabinet has sanctioned Rs 885.5 crore for the completion of the contentious Kalasa-Bhandura project .

“There is a need to finish the project as early as possible to meet drinking water needs. After a discussion with the chief minister (B S Yediyurappa), I will take the needful steps to complete work,” Karnataka water resources minister Ramesh Jarkiholi told reporters at Bengaluru, on Tuesday.

Earlier this month, the apex court had adjourned the case to August 24 for fixing a further date of hearing.

The three states, in their special leave petitions, have challenged the award given by Mhadei Water Disputes Tribunal on August 14, 2018, pertaining to the allocation of water.

The Union ministry of environment, climate and forest change, meanwhile, has already asked the Karnataka government to submit a new proposal to obtain forest clearance for the Kalasa-Bhandura project.

In its award, the Mhadei Water Disputes Tribunal had directed Karnataka to implement the project only after obtaining mandatory clearances as required by the law.

On August 14, 2018, the three-decade old dispute between Goa and Karnataka over sharing of the Mhadei water ended by the Mhadei Water Disputes Tribunal rejecting Karnataka’s demand for 36.5tmc feet of water. It allotted only 13.4tmc, including 3.9tmc ft for drinking purposes through diversions against its demand for 7.5tmc ft.

LUCKNOW: As the Covid crisis continues to hover, city residents have been looking at ways to buy a goat for sacrifice on Bakrid, falling on August 1.

From ordering online through Pashu Bazar — a platform providing procuring of animals for four years, to physically visiting goat farms and asking the butchers in colony to arrange goats, they have been trying everything they could.

“In the last 15 days, 200 people have ordered online. We now also give the option of video calling so that customers can have a look at the animal. The customer can also opt for doorstep delivery of animal,” said chief operating officer Vinay Gautam.

The number of orders will go up to at least 400 as the festival draws closer, he added.

“We work with local farmers of 100 villages between Rasoolpur Sadaat and Mahmudabad. We’ve sold 14,000 goats in the four years,” he added.

“Every year I got five truckloads of 30-40 goats from Meerut and Bulandshahr, but this year I got just one and 12 goats are still unsold. Earnings have been hit,” said Aslam Ali of FF goat farm on Sultanpur road.

He also added that the pandemic has led to people downsizing the number and size of goats they purchased. “Where is the purchasing power in these times?” he remarked.

Mohammad Rizwan of Zam Zam goat farm in Sadar said, “I am getting around 10 calls a day through little online marketing initiatives that I took late, since I wasn’t prepared for this situation. This year most of those coming to buy goats from me are from the nearby localities only,” he said.

This was unlike in the previous week when it was quite the opposite. The relatively young population, a majority among the fresh cases reported recently, getting cured faster was cited as the reason for this.

Between July 19 and 24, the average number of people from the city contracting the infection was lingering around 115 while those getting cured and discharged stood on an average 52 people. Throughout the week, fresh infection reported daily was surpassing the discharges. But, between July 25 and 27, an average 100 people per day were reported positive whereas around 115 on an average were getting discharged from hospitals in the city. Thus, the rate of discharge rose between 5% and 16% than the previous days while the rate of fresh infections rose between 4% and 7% between July 25 and 27. Trichy corporation maintained that the number of people being tested and screened in fever camps had not gone down. Instead, from testing 600 people a day a few weeks ago, the city tests around 1,100 a day now.

On the rise in discharge rate, the civic body said most of the family contacts of index cases recently tested positive were asymptomatic. Since asymptomatic patients recover quicker, the discharge rate has been gradually increasing. “The city recently recorded several asymptomatic cases among fresh cases. They are getting cured now, the city is not in an alarming situation. But, we are focussing on residents above 50 years to reduce the fatality risk,” S Sivasubramanian, corporation commissioner said. Among the four zones, K Abishekapuram so far had the highest recovery rate with 69% followed by Srirangam (66%) and Ponmalai and Ariyamangalam zones (59%). Experts opined that mild or low virulence causing the infection could also have been reason for the quicker recovery.

393,['29/07/2020'],"Survival of tigers at risk in Goa’s forests, says report","File photo of a tiger on a camera trap in Mhadei Wildlife Sanctuary

KERI: In January this year four tiger carcasses were found in and around the Mhadei Wildlife Sanctuary. This triggered a national uproar. Debates on how safe the big cat was in the state’s protected forests followed.

A February 2020 report submitted by the National Tiger Conservation Authority, Bengaluru had highlighted the apathy of the state’s forest department in safeguarding the tiger.

“It was observed that there were no proper protection mechanisms in place within the sanctuary, like a network of well-connected anti-poaching camps at strategic locations manned by forest guard/watchers 24x7, which is a very common feature of well managed protected tiger reserves,” the report had stated.

There are only four camps at Codal, Nagargao, Valpoi and Caranzol for a sanctuary spread over an area of more than 200sqkm, the report stated.

However, nearly five months later, nothing much has been done by the forest department to rectify shortcomings in the system. Additional principal chief conservator of forests, Santosh Kumar told TOI that his department is still in the process of establishing anti-poaching camps and watch towers in the sanctuary.

“We have already taken steps for creating critical tiger breeding habitat inviolate areas. Systematic patrolling for safeguarding tigers, their prey and habitat has been initiated. In spite of the Covid-19 pandemic, our staff is making necessary arrangements for providing infrastructure required for efficient management of the tiger habitats,” he said.

The report, submitted by a team headed by Rajendra Garawad, additional inspector general of forests with the Bengaluru authority, had laid stress on the importance of an organised anti-poaching camp network and regular patrolling. “It is highly possible that tigers, their prey base and other flora, fauna might be subjected to varying degrees of poaching pressure, but there is no way to know unless a good protection and information network is put in place,” the report had stated.

Experts said that killing of the four tigers in January and one other in April 2009 in Keri-Sattari inside a cashew plantation had brought to fore not only the threat of poaching, but also man animal conflict.

“Increasing anthropogenic activities have resulted in decreasing tigers as well as prey and their habitat,” member of the Goa State Wildlife Advisory Board, Arnold Noronha said.

It was suspected that the four tigers were killed by the tribals who live in the vicinity after two of their buffaloes were killed by a tiger in December 2019.

Latest data collected by the forest department shows the presence of three tigers in the Mhadei Wildlife Sanctuary.

As the world marks World Tiger Day on Wednesday, Noronha said that if no sincere efforts are made, tigers will face extinction in the wilds of Goa.

HYDERABAD: In a case involving inter-state travel during the time of pandemic, Hyderabad police caught a thief who stole Rs 90 lakh cash from a businessman and fled to Gujarat. Despite the Covid-19 scare, cops are still pursuing inter-state investigations in important cases while following all safety precautions.

On July 13, Abids police received a complaint from Ravindera Majethiya , who runs a finance firm, NK & Co in Ahmedabad and Hyderabad. Majethiya alleged that Rakesh Kannara, who is a friend of his employee, Jay Kumar, had stolen Rs 90 lakh cash from their Hyderabad office in Jagdish Market, Abids.

Police team verified the CCTV camera footage and found out that Babu Kannara alias Rakesh Kannara went to Patancheru in an auto from Abids. Police also questioned Majethiya’s Hyderabad office employees, Jay Kumar and Mohith. Jay told that Rakesh confined him in the room by tying up his arms and legs with a duct tape and took his cell phone. From Jay’s cell phone, Rakesh sent messages to Mohith asking him not to disturb him for few hours. Rakesh also sent messages to Mohith from Jay’s phone instructing him to collect Rs 90 lakh cash from two persons in the city and keep it in the office, Abids police said.

After Mohith kept the cash in the office and went out, Rakesh picked up the money and fled from the city. Though Rakesh switched off his known phone numbers, police managed to identify one number he was using and they tracked him to Surat. Rakesh travelled in trucks from Telangana to Gujarat via Karnataka and Maharashtra. He paid Rs 14 lakh advance to a Hyundai showroom in Surat to purchase a SUV.

“As he reached the car showroom to take delivery of the SUV, our team nabbed him. Almost the entire amount of stolen money was recovered. After the health checkup our team brought the accused to city on a transit warrant in the third week of July. On Monday, our team took him into custody for questioning,” Central Zone DCP P Viswa Prasad said.

395,['29/07/2020'],Bombay HC: Are there checks to ensure patients not fleeced over PPEs?,"Bombay high court

MUMBAI: Are there regulations to ensure that private hospitals and nursing homes don’t overcharge patients for personal protection equipment (PPE) kits amid the coronavirus pandemic, the Bombay high court asked the state government on Tuesday.

“The concern expressed is that patients should not be fleeced during the pandemic,” said Chief Justice Dipankar Datta, who along with Justice Sarang Kotwal, heard a public interest litigation by advocate Abhijit Mangade. Citing his experience, Mangade alleged that private hospitals are charging patients for PPE kits above the procurement rates and urged the HC to cap the charges.

Mangade’s mother, a non-Covid patient, was admitted at Jupiter Hospital in Thane on June 21. Six days later, he was issued a bill of Rs 72,000 for PPE kits, including gloves. Mangade’s PIL also mentioned how Punamiya Hospital in Dadar had charged a patient Rs 16,500 for PPE kits for three days.

Mangade argued that the BMC has capped the price of PPE kits and issued a circular listing 44 vendors from whom they can be bought. “My grievance is not on the medical line of treatment, but on overcharging of PPE kits,” he added. The CJ pointed out that a box of gloves may be used for other patients too. “The hospital would be profiteering by charging from two different patients. Is there a machinery to regulate it?”

While no advocate appeared for Jupiter Hospital, advocate Ish Jain, representing Punamiya Hospital, said it’s small hospital and 80% beds are reserved for BMC. Recalling an earlier PIL where the state had said that often doctors wear PPE suits for several hours as they don’t get time to remove them even to eat meals, Jain pointed out that the Dadar hospital also has non-Covid patients and hence it’s risky to wear the same suit. He said seven of the 30 staffers including a doctor, a nurse and an ECG operator were infected.

When asked about other private hospitals, assistant government pleader Nisha Mehra said a May 21 circular regulates the treatment charges and sought time to file a reply on the current status. Noting that “the issue raised by PIL deserves consideration”, the bench posted the next hearing on August 7.

They are holding classes for high school students through their YouTube channel ‘KVS Guru’.

The unique feature of the channel is the recreation of the classroom experience through a variety of open-source softwares and hardwares.

Vajra Narasimha Reddy, headmaster of Kadiri Upper Primary School and national best teacher in ICT (information and communications technology) category in 2017, conceptualised the idea and joined hands with his colleagues Sankar Narayana Reddy and Kiran Kumar.

“We at, KVS Guru, are trying to meet the teaching-learning needs of the students during these trying times. The channel started on April 27 and it has already garnered more than 8.15 lakh views. Several like-minded teachers joined our efforts as it involves experts of all subjects. Every crisis brings equal opportunities and we are all happy to see all these teachers, parents and students supporting our initiative,” said Vajra Narasimha, Sankar and Kiran.

The trio, who spend about 12 hours a day on the video lessons, added that the duration of a video for class IX and X is around 45 minutes in adherence to the State Council of Educational Research and Training (SCERT) guidelines.” While four classes can be conducted for these two classes, only two classes are allowed for classes VI to VIIII. Now, we are planning to take the initiative forward by offering lessons to the primary classes,” said Vajra Narasimha, Sankar and Kiran.

Through lawyers Yashodeep Deshmukh and Vinod Sangvikar, they wanted to raise the issue of public health taking precedence over right to privacy.The bench, however, wondered what purpose would be served by revealing names and said if one takes all necessary precautions, he need not worry about getting infected. “It all depends on each person,” said the bench, adding that after all taking care of oneself is in his own hands and said people could try to “avoid chit chatting…especially congregations”.People “need to be more cautious, wear mask, face shield and use sanitiser and keep washing their hands,” said the bench. One thing which a person can do is take proper care and precaution to stay away from infection, was the court’s oral advice.The Centre, through additional solicitor general Anil Singh, opposed the PIL and cited judgments of Madhya Pradesh, Orissa and Madras high courts refusing relief in similar pleas for revealing patients’ names.The Madras HC had, while dismissing a petition in April, said that revealing identities could “lead to law and order and public order problem, apart from the social stigma, sometimes may lead to excommunication also”.The Madhya Pradesh HC had on May 28 dismissed a similar PIL as withdrawn after observing that the PIL “runs contrary to public interest” and was inclined impose costs of Rs 25000 on the petitioner who then decided to withdraw.An advisory by the MP government which advised not to reveal identity of those who test positive for Covid-19 or are under quarantine is “in larger public interest and to prevent chaos”, also to prevent those who tested positive “from public wrath’’, the MP high court had said.The HC gave the petitioners’ counsel time to study these judgments and posted the matter to Fridayfor further hearing.",mumbai,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-47529300,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-110164,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/disclosing-names-of-covid-19-positive-patients-involves-risk-of-ostracisation-says-high-court/articleshow/77229330.cms

PANAJI: Four teachers involved in setting the controversial question paper for the Class X English board exam have been found guilty of not adhering to the paper setting rules. They have been debarred from being engaged for any confidential exam-related work of the Goa board chairman Ramkrishna Samant said on Tuesday.

“We have debarred them from board work. We have taken the decision and conveyed it to the teachers. As per the inquiry committee, they were (found guilty),” Samant told reporters.

The teachers are debarred from all exam-related work, including supervision at the public exam, he said.

Among the four teachers, one is from a government school and has been issued a memo by the directorate. In the case of the remaining three, who are employees of aided schools, the directorate had issued notices to the management asking them to initiate action against the teachers.

The English subject paper, answered by students on May 23, stirred a controversy after one grammar-related question went viral on social media. The contentious question featured a conversation between two friends where one seems to suggest to the other that opting for Portuguese citizenship is a good choice. It includes the friend stating that it is difficult to land a job in Goa without bribery or use of influence.

Following widespread criticism, the board set up an independent committee to inquire into the matter. On June 19, the board chairman had said that prima facie fault has been found in the paper’s content by the inquiry committee.

The board’s committee had questioned all the paper setters involved, including the head of the paper setting panel for the subject.

401,['29/07/2020'],Karnataka likely to slide from top spot in Covid-19 reporting,"A staffer collects a sample at a fever clinic

BENGALURU: Going by the state of affairs in Bengaluru Urban, Karnataka, which was the top state in Covid-19 data reporting till June 1, might go downhill in the rankings if there is another analysis.

On July 21, a Stanford University research study compared the health reportage of 29 states in India, based on how each had been sharing data and releasing analysis of the pandemic.

The study suggested the key components of managing Covid-19 were public awareness and trust in the government. And this was in turn critically dependent on timely and accessible dissemination of Covid data by the government.

At the top was Karnataka, with a score of 0.6, based on availability of data, their accessibility and granularity in providing the smallest details of virus progression. This data comparison, though, was for the period between May 18 and June 1.

Most experts within and outside the government believe since then, Karnataka has been facing a serious data compilation crisis, as the authorities are still unable to trace more than 3,000 missing Covid-positive patients. This is also largely happening due to lack of coordination with the Covid war room meant to gather data.

Things have come to such a pass that the medical education minister, who is in charge of the Covid-19 task force in Bengaluru, hasn’t been able to provide an accurate and daily data update. “There has been a serious gap in handling data reportage and analysis by the government,” said senior officials privy to the war room happenings.

While the government was able to compare, analyse and inform people about the situation in 29 districts — be it related to testing, bed allotment and movement, death rate, contact tracing, home quarantine, etc., — the same could not be done for Bengaluru Urban, which has the highest number of positive cases.

Till June 1, when the study was conducted by the Stanford researchers, cases in Karnataka and Bengaluru were traceable and manageable. However, post Unlock 1.0, which came into effect from June 8, cases started climbing and the government began facing the tough task of compiling data and analysing the same. “With the stigma associated with Covid-19, most do not want to reveal their details. They give wrong phone numbers and sketchy personal information. It has become increasingly tough for people on the ground to collate data and analyse them,” said multiple IAS officers deputed to fight the pandemic.

Add to this, the change of BBMP chief and decentralisation of Covid management have meant that none in the government has been able to give a clear picture.

On the other end, regular health briefing by the state started to stutter after political one-upmanship within the government and “other commitments” began taking precedence. Medical education and Covid-19 minister K Sudhakar, despite being asked to brief the media, and in turn allay the concerns of the common man, has been missing his schedule either due to meetings or prior commitments.

After schools shut down, I lost my job and had to sit at home for some time. With lockdown in force, there was little I could do with my skill sets to earn money. I, therefore, picked up odd jobs, like distributing milk pouches, to make ends meet,” Akash told TOI.But the measly earnings could hardly make ends meet for the 32-year-old. “When the lockdown eased, I began working as a driver, offering my services to anyone wanting to travel outside the city. But this too barely helps meet our monthly expenses. I am now looking for some regular job,” said Akash, who has two kids. There was sadness in his voice when he added, “Being a qualified coach and a national football player, I never thought I would have to take up such jobs for survival.”But he isn’t the only national footballer struggling to survive.Stephen Fernandez, a 26-year-old goalkeeper who has played in the prestigious Santosh Trophy, is now a provision store worker for the past few months. “With schools closed, sports coaches have become jobless. I was also asked to leave and our salaries too stopped.

NEW DELHI: Authorities in different districts of the capital are going to put stress on RT-PCR tests in the wake of Delhi high court asking the Delhi government why it is not ramping up the gold standard test as per the ICMR guidelines .

A senior official in the directorate general health services, Dr Nutan Mundeja, said that there is a standing instruction to all the districts to conduct as many RT-PCR tests as possible under the guidelines for Covid-19 testing. Delhi has been recently conducting only 50% of its capacity of 11,000 RT-PCR tests per day.

The combined capacity of the private sector and public sector laboratories in Delhi is 54 and approximately 11,000 tests through RT-PCR can be conducted in a day. The government has conducted less than 6,000 RT-PCR tests daily between July 15 and July 23.

Sources in different districts said that the testing centres would now be asked to carry out more RT-PCR tests.

“Since RT-PCR tests involve a process, which is not as easy as the rapid antigen tests, the people on the ground tend to prefer antigen tests. Also, the samples have to be sent to the labs for the RT-PCR tests, while the antigen tests give result in a short period of time,” said sources.

Dr Niraj Roy, surveillance officer of West district, said the district has planned to conduct more RT-PCR tests, which give more reliable outcome. “Around 50 dispensaries are located in the district,” added Dr Roy.

As per the guidelines issued, a reference letter of the local committee — comprising corporators and village panchayat members — will now be necessary for those choosing to stay under home quarantine.

The letter is necessary to check whether the patient has a separate room attached with toilet and bathroom along with a family member that can take care of them.

Yogesh Sale, district health officer, said, “Detailed guidelines have been provided to the local bodies. Only those having no symptoms will be given home isolation . The person will not just be tested for Covid-19 but for other things like blood pressure, diabetes and lung diseases. The local committees will have to check whether the patient can isolate himself from his family members in a separate room. The family members should stay in touch with the local committee members as well as the doctors. The doctors will call the home isolated patients twice a day and the ground staff will visit their homes and check their oxygen levels with the help of pulse oximeters.”

He added, “If the committee find that the home isolation is no suitable for the patient, then the patient will be admitted to a Covid care centre. The doctors can release the home isolated patient only after he or she does not show any symptoms for three straight days. No further testing will be done, instead the patient will be asked to isolate himself at home for seven more days.”

“For the past few days, some resident doctors on Covid duty had posted complaints on our social media group. So, the association wrote to the vice-chancellor,” said RDWA general secretary Dr Saurabh Srivastav.

“It is inhuman to treat frontline healthcare warriors with such poor facilities when governments world over are doing so much for their well being,” the RDWA said in the letter.

However, KGMU spokesperson Dr Sudhir Singh said, “KGMU is providing good quality food to all doctors and employees on Covid duty. They have also been given accommodation in guest houses and hostels. Since a complaint has been filed, it will be probe and strict action taken if it is found true.”

This is despite the exams being held in the midst of a pandemic from May 21 to June 6.It is for the fifth time in six years that the pass percentage has improved, with 7% more students passing Class X this year as against 2015. Last year, 92.5% had cleared the Class X exams.And it was not just quantity, the highest scores by students also improved in all subjects in 2020.Also, nearly 70% of the students that appeared for the Class X Goa board exams either passed it with a distinction or a first class.This year, 18,939 students appeared for the exam, and of these, 17,554 cleared it.Of the girls that appeared for the exam, 8,973 or 93.3% cleared the exam. Among the boys, 8,581 or 92% passed Class X.Goa board was probably among the first state boards to conduct the Class X exams during the pandemic.Goa board officials as well as other educationists said that a steady improvement in performance at public exams is a trend seen by all boards nationally.“Over the years the board has introduced many schemes like internal marks, sports marks, grace marks. This is helping improve the pass percentage But this is a trend seen in other states as well,” board chairman Ramkrishna Samant said.Former Goa board chairman Jose Remedios Rebello said that the improvement in pass percentage began to show more prominently from 2015. The year coincided with then board’s decision to honour schools, which not only had 100% pass percentage, but also those who saw over 95% of its students clear the exam.“The trend will only go up now. It is seen nationally that schools are trying more and students are getting more competitive. Every parent is more closely monitoring the child’s performance. Also, in recent years, it is seen that schools begin preparing students for the board exams from April itself and do not wait for school reopening in June,” said Rebello.He said that the inclusion of internal marks component has also helped better reflect the students’ performance.In 2020, 118 schools – 20 more than 2019 – recorded cent percent results. These 118 schools included 35 government schools.“There are around 70 government high schools. This means that 50% have cent percent passing,” said Samant.Rebello said that the introduction of National Skills Qualification Framework (NSQF) some years ago has helped achieve this. Under NSQF, students can opt for an additional subject and they have to clear any six to pass Class X. Around 89 high schools offer NSQF subjects and this year as many as 1,708 students cleared Class X with the help of the scheme.The Goa board data shows that at the Class X 2020 exam only 8.8% students scraped through the exam with a pass class.Having been held during a pandemic, the exam took place through 29 centres and an increased number of 173 sub-centres to ensure social distancing. Of these, four sub-centres were at the Maharashtra border and two at the Karnataka border to accommodate students from these areas who attend school in Goa.",goa,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-77233204,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-102213,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/during-pandemic-92-7-pass-goa-boards-class-x-exams/articleshow/77230199.cms

Ahmedabad: When schools across India are shut due to Covid, a school run by the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation in Gulbai Tekra seems to have endangered the lives of its students. They were seen attending classroom studies on Tuesday.

The authorities quickly suspended the principal and issued a show-cause notice to four teachers. The teachers were asked to explain why they should not meet the same fate as their boss. Also, an inquiry committee has been set up by the authorities.

Some parents claimed that the students had been called to the school to take written exams. L D Desai, the administrator of the school ward, rubbished that claim and said that the unit tests are to be begin from July 29. He said that the students have to take the tests from their homes.

Asked why the students had gathered in the class, Desai said that they had come to clear some doubts regarding the ‘home learning sessions’.

Schools have been shut down since March due to the coronavirus pandemic and students have been promoted, en masse for 2019-20 academic year.

Schools will have to make arrangements for the free distribution of education materials to students who are entitled to them, said sources. This has to be done keeping in mind various physical distancing norms. Various mediums like mobile applications, television programmes, and online education platforms are to be used for home learning, according to sources.

412,['29/07/2020'],Rain makes a splash on Chennai’s outskirts,"CHENNAI: Dark, low-hanging clouds have brought thunderstorms to Chennai outskirts and broken a 66-year-old record at Meenambakkam weather station — that of the highest rainfall in July — but people living in the core city are still waiting for a good spell of rain . Tuesday was no different. While residents wonder why, meteorologists blame it on the climatology.N Puviarasan, director, Area Cyclone Warning Centre, IMD said wind convergence, the meeting of sea and land breezes, which results in convective activity bringing rainfall, occurs mostly away from the coast.“Usually the convergence happens some 20km or 30km from the coast, bringing rainfall to the interiors, only sometimes moving towards city core areas. This is why the recent rainfall has been more in the interior areas,” he said.From July 1 to 27, Nungambakkam weather station recorded 51mm of rain while Meenambakkam recorded 271mm, sneaking past the previous record of 266mm in July 1954 after a 15mm spell on July 20. Between June 1 and July 27, Nungambakkam recorded 92mm and Meenambakkam 288mm. While the Chennai subdivision has a deficit of 2% from June 1 to July 28, the heavy rainfall on Tuesday that left 10mm in Nungambakkam and 20mm in Meenambakkam may have improved the rainfall records for the city. “For the next three days, we have chances of good rainfall before monsoon picks up on the west coast over Mumbai and Gujarat in the first week of August,” an IMD official said.A cyclonic circulation lying over southeast and adjoining southwest Bay of Bengal also influenced the wind convergence on Tuesday evening, which saw rainfall across many areas at the same time, one of the few instances this season.Rain lashed southern suburbs including Chromepet, Tambaram, Perungalathur and core city localities such as Purasaiwalkam, T Nagar, Choolaimedu, Aminjikarai, Koyambedu, Kodambakkam, MMDA Colony, Nungambakkam, Pattalam, Otteri, Pulianthope, Choolai and Vyasarpadi. But areas such as Park Town, Royapuram and Thiruvottiyur that are closer to the sea remained largely cloudy and dry.Rainfall in the suburbs has nevertheless improved storage in the reservoirs as well groundwater levels in the city. Weather blogger Pradeep John said Tiruttani, upstream of Poondi reservoir, received 359.8mm rainfall since June 1, an excess of 48%. “Even areas such as Chembarambakamm and Red Hills recorded good rainfall, nearly 300mm for July, which is very rare,” he said.The combined storage in the city’s four reservoirs and Veeranam is now at 48%. As of July 27, catchment areas in Tiruvallur had 8% and Kancheeipuram 45% excess rainfall.The spells have also improved groundwater levels both in the city and neighbouring districts. Hydrogeologists said Chennai groundwater has shown a rise of one to 2.5metres compared to July 2019.",chennai,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-77232651,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-463623,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/rain-makes-a-splash-on-chennais-outskirts/articleshow/77229319.cms
413,['29/07/2020'],Logistics sector demands industry status from govt,"In a bid to boost growth, the logistics sector is seeking industry status from the Andhra Pradesh government. This will not only help logistics players grow their business but also lead to generation of higher local employment as it’s a labour intensive sector, said experts.

“The government has to give the logistics sector industry status. The Uttar Pradesh government has already given it. If we are granted industry status, it will offer many advantages such as in the area of land conversion, warehouse construction and property taxes, among others. The other area is infrastructure development,” G Sambasiva Rao, MD, Sravan Shipping Services Pvt Ltd, said at the session on ‘Ports, shipping & logistics: Navigating choppy waters in Covid times’ as part of ‘TOI’s Reboot Andhra Pradesh: Making AP Future Positive’ conclave, supported by RINL, in association with Visakhapatnam Special Economic Zone, Eastern Power Distribution Company of Andhra Pradesh, Coastal Local Area Bank and TNR Talent High School.

Krishna GV Giri, executive vice-chairman of AP Economic Development Board (APEDB), mooted port-led industrialisation. “If you take the GVA (gross value added), it is Rs 37,000 per head for the entire country, Rs 33,000 for AP, while for Gujarat it is Rs 1,11,000 per head because they have some fantastic ports which led to the growth of business and industries around it. We are not just planning ports but are also looking at industrial zones around it,” he said.

While creation of infrastructure takes time, in the near term, adoption of digital technologies can help these sectors. Saurabh Kumar, CEO, GMR Cargo & national board member, Air Cargo Forum India (AFCI), said adoption of tech will give these sectors visibility and also ensure economies of scale. Shivaprasad Raja, principal, The Boston Consulting Group (BCG), too felt that more companies are willing to up their tech platform spend due to the pandemic.

Anil Narayanan, deputy COO, Visakha Container Terminal Pvt Ltd, said after geopolitical tension between India and China increased recently, there has been minute scrutiny by Chinese authorities in clearing Indian goods.

Warisha Ali , 20, had gone missing on July 25. Fearing the worst, her parents had rushed to police claiming that she might have been killed for dowry. And she was, indeed.

Warisha, a resident of Aligarh, got married to Aamir on June 1 and happily moved into his house in Bulandshahr. “That was the last time I saw her happy,” her mother said, adding she was constantly being harassed for dowry.

After the body was recovered, and identified, police in Bulandshahr registered an FIR against Warisha’s husband Aamir and his parents for dowry killing. The case was filed at the city's Kotwali police station on Tuesday afternoon. “The deceased’s husband and her in-laws have been arrested. Further probe is on,” Santosh Kumar, Bulandshahr’s senior superintendent of police (SSP) said. Interestingly, when Warisha went missing on July 25, Aamir had approached police and filed a complaint.

For Ghaziabad Police , establishing the woman’s identity was also an uphill task. They shared her photograph and details on hundreds of WhatsApp groups and also contacted several police stations in neighbouring districts and states. Finally, one of Warisha’s uncles in Delhi’s Uttam Nagar identified her from the photo and alerted the police and family.

Senior superintendent of police (SSP) of Ghaziabad, Kalanidhi Naithani, said, “The picture and identification details of the deceased were shared on several social media platforms and WhatsApp groups. One of her relatives in Delhi identified her.”

“We have incurred loss of over Rs 41 crore due to Covid-19 pandemic. The OTS scheme will attract defaulters to pay the pending amount, else we will have to take strict action against them,” he added.

As per LDA records, nearly 50% of the revenue comes from the sale of housing and commercial units, while around Rs 8 crore is generated through ticketing at parks under its jurisdiction and Rs 10 crore from parking slots.

Other source of revenue generation for LDA are map layout approval (Rs 6 crore), rent from housing and commercial properties (Rs 23 crore), and monetary penalty imposed on violation of construction norms.

Yogesh Dhama, the MLA from Baghpat constituency, claimed that a crackdown against illegal sand mining in his region has irked several key aides of the gangster.

The MLA’s request came about 20 days after an RLD worker was shot dead in Baghpat over what local police said was a row surrounding transportation of illegally mined sand.

MLA Dhama said that he had approached chief minister Yogi Adityanath over the massive illegal sand mining going on in his region, leading to a crackdown.

“Illegal mining was going on in Baghpat’s Badrakha area. I had complained about it to the chief minister and told him how local farmers are being harassed by criminals involved in the mining. So a probe was launched and it found my claims to be true. And then a penalty of Rs 4crore was slapped on an aide of Rathi and the mining lease was also cancelled,” Dhama said.

“A brick kiln owner was also shot dead by Rathi’s men recently, and I have learnt that his goons are now after me for the complaint about the illicit mining lease,” he said.

Due to this crackdown, criminals involved in sand mining have suffered financial losses to the tune of crores of rupees, the MLA claimed.

When contacted, Meerut’s inspector general of police (IG) Praveen Triapthi said, “His (Dhama’s) security has been beefed up. I have also directed Baghpat’s superintendent of police (SP) to look into the matter. We are analyzing the threat from all dimensions and a list of his (Rathi’s) associates and supporters is being made. Recently, one of Rathi’s men was held in an encounter. He is accused of killing the RLD worker.”

Rathi is also accused of shooting dead another gangster Munna Bajrangi inside Baghpat jail on July 9, 2018. He was later transferred to Tihar on the direction of a local court. Police suspect that he is now operating from the high-security jail.

With the Centre releasing over Rs 1.6 lakh crore as GST compensation to states and Union Territories on Monday, the entire compensation for the financial year 2019-20 has been settled. The highest compensation was given to Maharashtra, followed by Karnataka (Rs 18,628 crore) and Gujarat (Rs 14,801 crore).

Last December, chief minister Uddhav Thackeray had written to finance minister Nirmala Sitaraman to release GST compensation as early as possible.

“While Maharashtra is waiting for its legitimate dues of Rs 15,558 crore from the Centre, it is also suffering due to a shortfall in tax devolution. Timely release of GST compensation and tax devolution amount will help my state manage finances efficiently…as per the CAG report, it is noticed that IGST settlement for many transactions is not happening,” Thackeray had written .

He had also pointed out that owing to the slowdown in the economy, there was a shortfall in GST collection compared to the benchmark growth of 14%. “During the current financial year, we have received Rs 5,635 crore as GST compensation for four months, however, Rs 8,611 crore is due up to November 2019,” Thackeray had said.

A finance department official, requesting anonymity, said that the Covid-19 lockdown has had an adverse impact on GST collection in Maharashtra, which dropped to Rs 9,000 crore as against the monthly average of Rs 15,500 crore—a shortfall of Rs 6,500 crore. At the national level too, GST collection saw a steady downfall to Rs 1.85 lakh crore in 2020 from Rs 3.14 lakh crore in 2019.

Little showers are expected on July 29 but a further break in the spell is expected till August 2. The latest India Meteorology Department forecast states that Kolhapur district will witness heavy rainfall for five to six days from August 3.

However, the week-long pause in the rains has caused worry among farmers. Many rice cultivators have stopped the transplantation of the paddy after the agriculture department informed them about the possible dry spell.

District agriculture superintendent Dnyandeo Wakure said, “We are assessing how many farmers and how much area is still to be brought under rice cultivation. Usually by July-end, the rice transplantation is completed. Rice cultivation needs waterlogging in the farms and continuous rainfall. Those having farms near lakes and rivers can easily irrigate their farms for rice cultivation. However, those located farther away have to wait to avoid losses.”

Wakure added that crops such as ragi and soybean are in danger due to break in the rainfall. “Farmers, who have taken up these crops in hill slopes with shallow soil, solely depend on the rainfall for the growth. Around 6,500 hectares of ragi crop is in danger,” he said.

He added that heavy rains are expected in the first week of August, which will help farmers to resume the activities.

So far, around 9,000 mm of rainfall has been recorded during this monsoon season. In last one week, total rainfall in the district was around 700 mm. The dams in the district are filled up to 60% of their capacity.

Corbett’s tiger count has been rising — from 137 in 2006 to 174 in 2010 and 215 in 2014. ""We had expected the numbers to be over 250,"" said director of the reserve, Rahul (who goes by his first name). This time, it is the only reserve with more than 200 tigers and has the highest tiger density in the country, 14. It is followed by Nagarhole (127) and Bandipur (126), both in Karnataka, Bandhavgarh in Madhya Pradesh (MP) and Kaziranga in Assam (104 each). Among states, MP topped the tiger estimation, with 526 (it had 308 last time), going past Karnataka (524 this time, 406 earlier). Uttarakhand remained on the third spot, with 442 tigers, up from 340 previously. The All India Tiger Estimation is undertaken every four years, the latest in 2018.

The count in Dudhwa Tiger Reserve, which straddles the India-Nepal border, has also gone up. “It is a splendid increase, from 58 in the last estimation to 82 this time,” said Sanjay Kumar Pathak, field director of the reserve. Pilibhit reserve's tiger population is also up by two to 57. And what used to be a non-tiger zone in Uttar Pradesh, Sohagi Barwa Wildlife Sanctuary in Maharajganj, now has one tiger. In fact, the Shivalik Hills and Gangetic Plains (Uttarakhand, Uttar Pradesh and Bihar) have witnessed a significant increase in tiger population, from 485 to 646, in keeping with the national trend (which saw a 33% jump). The Central India & Eastern Ghats belt, which covers eight states, saw the biggest jump, 50%.

Four of the country’s 50 reserves — Udnati Sitanadi in Chhattisgarh, Satkosia in Odisha, Mukundra in Rajasthan and Kawal in Telangana — have just one tiger.

Qamar Qureishi, senior scientist at the Wildlife Institute of India-Dehradun (WII), which put together the report with the National Tiger Conservation Authority, said some conservation aspects still need to be addressed. “Ecologically sensitive development is what’s needed. A large section depends on nature for livelihood and survival. We have to ensure integrity of all corridors to protect wildlife.”

But Mizoram’s Dampa reserve and Bengal’s Buxa lost the 6 tigers they had between them.

425,['29/07/2020'],Food delivery apps levy ‘bad weather charge’ in Chennai,"A food delivery agent braves heavy rain in the city on Tuesday to ferry a parcel

CHENNAI: The rain in the city over the past month has led to food delivery rates rising, with online food aggregators collecting, alongside regular delivery and distance charges, ‘bad weather’ fees from users.

For instance, a customer ordering food for Rs 400 from a restaurant 5km from his/her residence has to pay close to Rs 50 in such ‘fee’ that increases based on distance and weather conditions as well as traffic conditions and seasonal demand..

“I don’t remember paying any additional fee during rain in the past. On Tuesday, I was charged Rs 20 extra,” said Madipakkam resident R Veera, who uses Swiggy for ordering food.

Sources in Swiggy said bad weather fee had always been collected from users across the country and that surge pricings can be avoided on attaining ‘super customer’ status that customers can buy for a minimum of Rs Rs 149 for a month. The scheme, temporarily withdrawn a few months ago because of the lockdown, was revived recently, sources said.

Zomato, which too collects distance fee, was unavailable for comment.

Food aggregators claim additional fee collected is transferred to delivery executives’ accounts to compensate for travelling in tough conditions.

Delivery executives admit getting this incentive but say it is delayed at times. “However, more customers tip us than usual. They understand the risk associated with our work and give ₹10-₹20 extra and sometimes even more,” said Dinesh, a delivery man from Velachery. This comes in handy while refilling vehicles’ fuel tanks as petrol price increased more than ₹Rs 10 in two months.

Meanwhile, layoffs continue with 350 employees being sacked this week. Earlier, Swiggy, Zomato and other firms together let go off nearly 1,500 employees. Firms claim the industry has recovered only by 50% and this was the final round of restructuring but employees’ salaries have been restored.

More than 200 persons were fined for not using masks and ignoring social distancing norm. The KMC staff even distributed masks to senior citizens who did not have the protective gear. The staff imposed a fine of Rs 500 on the shops for not ensuring social distancing on their premises.

At many places, the shops were open till 6.30 pm. Local corporators and activists were seen dialling the KMC staff to take action against the owners of such shops.

Pandit Pawar, head of anti-encroachment department, said, “We have fined 6 shopowners across the city for not closing their establishments on time. We have noticed that as the deadline approaches, many citizens rush to the shops, and leading to congestion outside.”

The district authorities have allowed take-home service of the food. However, home delivery has not been allowed.

At several places, barbershops and salons were operating with their shutters down. Pawar said he has received some complaints about salons operating clandestinely and action will be taken against them. Before the 100% lockdown, salons were allowed to operate, however, they are now not allowed to open till July 31.

NEW DELHI: Days after media reports of long queues being recorded at Indira Gandhi International Airport with passengers having to wait for 10 to 12 hours to get through the immigration process , protective glass shields have been installed at the immigration counters, allowing faster processing of passengers while maintaining social distancing norms.

Sources said around 150 glass shields have been installed, including at the e-visa counters and in both the arrival and departure areas.

Confirming the developments, IGI operator Delhi International Airport Limited (DIAL) said two people could now safely complete their immigration process at the same time, while also maintaining social distancing norms. DIAL CEO Videh Kumar Jaipuriar said efficiency levels are expected to improve with the protective shields now in place, allowing more passengers to be processed each hour.

“The safety of everyone working at Delhi airport is paramount to us. As a part of our preparedness for resumption of international commercial service, we have installed glass shields at immigration counters so that two persons can safely complete the process from each counter without compromising their safety,” Jaipuriar claimed.

IGI is currently operating at 10% of the original traffic due to the novel coronavirus pandemic. To make the process even faster going ahead, computerised camera-based thermal scanners are also being used in order to reduce time at the Airport Health Organisation checking counters.

TOI had reported last week how passengers had to wait for long hours in order to get through the immigration process without any food or water. To change that, DIAL has also set up food and beverage kiosk in the area, along with additional seats.

“Computerised camera-based thermal scanners are also functioning at the arrival and departure gates to ensure that each passenger’s temperature is measured in real-time. These scanners capture the body temperature automatically as a passenger passes through the gates,” said an airport source.

Starting from the moment his family’s electronic business crashed, to the time his mother was allegedly murdered, to more recently, when the pandemic shut his 21-year-old restaurant in Puducherry , the restaurateur has always owed it to god, or “a few good men” for salvaging situations.Days into the first lockdown in March, Anthony took it in his stride as a much-needed break from work, hoping to get his French-Italian restaurant, Madame Shante’s, up and running in a few weeks.“The number of cases were few and our borders were shut, so we didn’t anticipate a big outbreak,” he says. However, as weeks wound into months, and the tourists left, his staff struggled to pay their kids’ tuition fees and parents’ healthcare expenses. Anthony decided that if there was one thing that could get them across as well as earn them goodwill, it was biryani.Madame Shante’s Car Biryani, which started out of two cars and 20 orders, has grown into four cars setting out every morning to deliver almost 1,000 parcels to doctors, labourers, families and white collar workers. Priced at Rs 70, the Car Biryani has brought Puducherry citizens together.“Biryani runs in our veins. But it was one of the least-marketed items at the restaurant,” says Anthony.But today, what started as a strategic business idea has made Anthony the town’s household name as he and his staff cook, pack and deliver the good old rice meal to anyone looking to for a few joys to celebrate in these unsettling times.“There have been moments in the past when I’ve narrowly survived losing the business. But today, when we have been thrown off guard, I feel like I’ve found myself, and it is because of my local brothers and sisters,” says Anthony.“In the future, whether or not the restaurant opens its doors, biryani will keep the wheels of Madame Shante’s cars greased.”",puducherry,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-77237081,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-403195,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/puducherry/good-old-biryani-brings-puducherry-restaurateur-business-brotherhood/articleshow/77229391.cms

Lucknow: After waiting for directives and permission from district administration for Bakra mandi for long, several goat farmers have set up a market by themselves in Dubagga since Bakrid is just a couple of days away.

Unlike in the past, when district administration gave permissions for setting up bakra mandis at designated spots, this year no instructions were issued due to Covid-19 crisis.

The goat farmers chose an open land in Dubagga and set up a market in desperation to sell their goats, while throwing all Covid protocols and social distancing norms to the wind.

When TOI’s photographer visited the site on Tuesday, people were brushing against each other as they off loaded their goats from mini-trucks and soon started beseeching customers and didn’t follow any distancing while showing their animals.

Hardly any goat farmer or customer was seen wearing mask or face cover and it seemed foolhardy to expect the people to be using sanitiser for keeping the virus at bay. The threat the chaotic situation posed raises questions on the inability of district administration and police to let it all happen unchecked could result in spread of coronavirus infection at a time when the city is witnessing high number of cases every day.

Vegetable, fruit, fish and other markets are allowed to operate, but there are strict orders to follow Covid-19 protocols.

The farmers, both Muslim and Hindu goat breeders, had come from nearby areas and said they incurred heavy losses during pandemic.

When TOI contacted district administration, officers said due action will be taken if safety protocols are not being followed.

439,['29/07/2020'],Valmiki Tiger Reserve thrives as 35 more species found: Tiger status report,"Sambar and chital are the most common animal species captured by the camera traps inside the tiger reserve in ... Read More

PATNA: The Valmiki Tiger Reserve is flourishing. Apart from the rise in the number of the big cats, as stated in the 2018 tiger status report , altogether 35 more species of animals have been found thriving in the sanctuary.

The detailed tiger status report, 2018, was released on Tuesday by Union forests minister Prakash Javedkar on the eve of the World Tiger Day on Wednesday.

Sambar and chital were the most common animal species captured by the camera traps inside the tiger reserve in West Champaran district, while the rusty spotted cat was the rarest, followed by pangolin.

The number of tigers in VTR is pegged at 33 with a density of 2.5 big cats per 100 km. The report states that tiger population using the tiger reserve was 33, while the number of tigers present in the reserve was 32. A total of six cubs have also been photo-captured.

The tiger number in VTR has shown an increase over the previous monitoring cycles and it has facilitated the colonization of Sohagibarwa Wildlife Sanctuary in Uttar Pradesh.

The VTR represents one of the last patches of forests with the unique combination of Terai-Bhabar vegetation, which harbours rich fauna of several endemic and globally endangered species such as tigers and the greater one-horned rhinoceros.

According to the report, the VTR habitat supports a good population of wild dogs — the only place in the Indian Terai to harbour this species— gaur and rhinoceros. Valmiki is the only protected area, where gaurs are found in the Shivaliks and Gangetic plains landscape.

The tiger status report also claims that VTR harbours other felids (cats), canids (dogs), ursids (bears) and viverrids such as leopard, fishing cat, jungle cat, leopard cat, Indian fox, dhole, sloth bear, and large Indian civet. Leopards were photo-captured throughout the tiger reserve. The important prey species of the reserve include chital, sambar, hog deer, nilgai, wild pig and gaur.

On rhinoceros, the report states that the western part of VTR reported rhino presence, where they occasionally come in from Chitwan National Park in Nepal. The report further states that VTR is considering reintroducing rhinos, but considerable investment in terms of protection regime and realignment of railway tract is required for that.

“It is due to the highest standard of habitat management that the number of tigers in VTR has increased from eight in 2008 to 32 at present. Besides, more than 35 other species of animals have been found in the reserve. The improved habitat management has led to expansion of the grassland, which has increased the population of herbivores. The herbivores population has in turn led to rise in number of tigers,” principal secretary (forests) Dipak Kumar Singh told TOI.

He added that the enhanced security by the SSB as well as forest guards along with posting of two more veterinarians has also helped in increasing the population of all species of animals.

“Our study for re- introducing rhinos in VTR is also in the final stages,” Singh said.

They are of the opinion that the system is not serving the purpose of controlling the rush in the market areas and people too are not observing social distancing.

Prafulla Sancheti of the Nashik City Grocers’ Association said, “Authorities should take note that the odd-even system is not at all working in the city. Those who are supposed to keep their establishments closed on a particular day are keeping the front gate of their outlets closed but operating from the other end, thereby eating into the business of those who are strictly following the P1-P2 system.”

Sancheti said while they have not written to any authority in this regard, the concerned authorities should take stock of the actual state of affairs in market places and arrive at a proper decision.

Inspector at Bhadrakali police station Sajan Sonawane said that they were daily making announcements in the market places to maintain social distancing and also appealing to the shopkeepers to strictly adhere to the odd-even system.

“Action is also being taken against shopkeepers who are violating instructions issued by senior officers,” said Sonawane.

441,['29/07/2020'],Karnataka Corona News: Karnataka government mulls tough measures to rein in private hospitals,"BENGALURU: Amid reports of private hospitals turning away Covid-19 patients, the Karnataka government is mulling stringent action to make them fall in line. It may even empower officials to impose heavy penalties and even suspend their registration if they refuse treatment to critical patients.Almost a month ago, the Karnataka government met representatives of private hospitals in the state, specifically those across Bengaluru, to seek 50% of their beds in the fight against the pandemic. However, there have been regular complaints about lack of beds, high treatment cost and denial of admission.While the government has said a section of private and corporate hospitals is leading the non-cooperation, private healthcare personnel hint at a serious ego clash between hospitals and Covid management authorities.On Tuesday, chief minister’s political secretary and chairman of the committee dealing with private hospitals SR Vishwanath narrated the experience of one of his followers who was admitted to a private hospital near Hebbal. “This person was admitted under the government quota but the hospital gave him a bill of Rs 12 lakh. It’s nothing but looting. The only way these hospitals can be reined in is by pulling down shutters of at least three or four of them to drive home the point,” he said.Kannada actor Sudharani had to use her clout to get herself admitted to Apollo hospitals, Seshadripuram for a non-Covid ailment. “It’s only because I know police commissioner Bhaskar Rao was I allowed entry into the hospital after its personnel kept me waiting on the street because of absurd norms. Imagine the plight of the common man!” she said.Issuing a warning, medical education minister K Sudhakar tweeted: “ I came across the news of actor Sudharani medical treatment at Apollo Hospitals, Seshadripuram. Not only her, no other common man should be faced with such dire circumstances. Action will be initiated against the private hospital in question.”He told TOI: “We’ve been facing this issue for a while and with rising number of cases, the support of private hospitals is needed. A section of hospitals is not cooperating, but we’ll set it right.”However, the Private Hospitals and Nursing Home Association (PHANA) said the government doesn’t understand their problems. “The government is spending crores of rupees on unnecessary expenditure. They can do a scientific study of costing and address private hospital’s needs,” said PHANA president Dr Prasanna.He added that there’s lot of tedious procedural delay in handing over beds. “More importantly, there is an ego problem within the government and it’s trying to armtwist private hospitals. During this pandemic, everyone must work hand in hand,” he said.Private hospitals’ main demand has been reduction of GST on life-saving medications like Remdesivir which is administered to a patient — at least six vials. “Each medication costs Rs 4,000 and 12% GST is levied on it. It’s the same with PPE kits and high flow nasal cannulas, all life-saving requirements. Why is the government not reducing or waiving it? It’ll bring down cost of treatment by 10-12% which can be passed on to the patient,” said PHANA president Dr Prasanna.",bengaluru,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-77233715,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-203775,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/ktaka-government-mulls-tough-measures-to-rein-in-private-hospitals/articleshow/77226480.cms

446,['29/07/2020'],Charges fixed for Covid treatment at Pvt hosps,"Route march of police in varanasi on Tuesday

Varanasi: The district administration has fixed the charges for private hospitals to treat Covid-19 patients. Also, the conditions for home isolation of positive cases have also been prescribed by the officials on Tuesday.

Regarding the private hospitals allowed for treating Covid-19 patients, district magistrate Kaushal Raj Sharma said all such hospitals will have to follow the guidelines of state government for charging fee of the services given to infected persons. The asymptomatic cases with moderate sickness will be per day charged Rs 10,000 apart from the price of PPE kits by the National Accreditation Board for Hospitals and Healthcare Providers (NABH) accredited hospital while non-accredited hospital will charge Rs 8,000.

Infected persons with severe sickness who do not need ventilators will be charged Rs 15,000 by NABH accredited hospital and non-accredited hospital will charge Rs 13,000, he said adding, the very severe sickness category patients, who will need ventilator facility, will be charged Rs 18,000 by NABH accredited hospitals and Rs 15,000 by non-accredited hospitals.

According to him, the Meridian Hospital in Sarnath, Medwin Hospital in Maidagin, Trimurti Hospital and Apex Hospital on DLW-Bhikaripur Road have been permitted to treat these patients.

About home isolation of positive cases, the DM made it clear that this facility will be allowed after examining the condition of patients and the arrangements available at their places. The patients, who will not have fever, cough, cold and respiratory problem, and also not have problems like diabetes, cardiac, kidney ailment and blood pressure, will be allowed to avail the facility of home isolation, he said. Having separate room and toilet and an attendant will also be a major condition for this facility.

Buying prescribed medical kit for patient and attendant apart from pulse oximeter, simple thermometer, sanitiser, masks and gloves, sodium hypochlorite solution, food and drinks that enhance immunity will also be a must, he said adding, after ensuring all these arrangements the patients will also have to give an undertaking.

The DM said that as per the directives of the government, the home isolation facility has been introduced. He said that 24 rapid response team have been formed for city areas and eight in rural belts. These RRTs will take stock of the condition of patients after confirmation of infection among them by visiting their places. The same team will take decision whether home isolation can be permitted to any patient. If the team will not find the patient suitable for the home isolation facility, he said adding, the patient will be rushed to level-1, 2 or 3 facility as per his condition. He said that to provide L-1 facility, some private nursing homes and hotels have been identified where patients can go on their own expenses.

447,['29/07/2020'],Put public health first: HC to state govt on Rath Yatra,"Ahmedabad: The Gujarat high court on Tuesday castigated the state government for its “appeasement policy” and said that public health should be given priority when considering permission for Lord Jagannath’s Rath Yatra.

The HC had last month restrained the annual procession and expressed disappointment at the authorities’ indecisiveness even after seven meetings with temple authorities.

The HC’s ire towards the government appeared to have been sharpened because of its last-minute petition seeking a nod for the procession. “What was disappointing was the passive and yielding approach of the state government,” the court said. “As a secular body heading the fight against Covid-19, the government’s main focus should be protecting the health and wellbeing of the people at all costs, even if it means hurting the religious sentiments of some religious leaders.”

The court went on to say: “With infection rates going up and our resources gradually depleting, it is mandatory to focus on health rather than religion.”

The HC said that for many, religion is supreme. But, it said, “to ensure the safety of ourselves, our family and our neighbours during this pandemic it is mandatory to make the choice of health over religion.”

The court commended people’s response to the cancellation of the 143rd Rath Yatra. It was to be held on June 23.

But the court tore into the government for not taking a firm stance. “In such critical times, there is no need to consult or discuss anything relating to religious practices with religious leaders at the cost of public health,” the court said. “We emphasize upon the need to prioritize the protection of public health over religious expression.”

The bench of Chief Justice Vikram Nath and Justice J B Pardiwala criticized police and state authorities’ failed efforts to persuade religious leaders. “Instead of…boldly refusing to allow the Rath Yatra citing public health reasons, the government chose to follow a policy of appeasement,” the judges said. They said police and government tried “coaxing to convince religious leaders, temple authorities and organizers connected with Shri Jagannath’s Rath Yatra.”

The judges went on to say: “During a pandemic, we do not have time for blandishments. We need action. Strong, pragmatic and robust action.”

449,['29/07/2020'],Dad accuses actress Rhea Chakraborty of abetting Sushant Singh Rajput’s suicide,"Sushant Singh Rajput

PATNA: Bollywood actress Rhea Chakraborty has been booked for abetting actor Sushant Singh Rajput ’s suicide. Sushant’s father K K Singh lodged an FIR against Rhea on Saturday, Patna SSP Upendra Kumar Sharma told TOI on Tuesday. The actor had allegedly hanged himself in his Mumbai flat on June 14.

In the six-page FIR lodged with Rajiv Nagar police station in Patna, Singh has accused Rhea of “unlawfully confining Sushant, criminal breach of trust and abetting suicide”. The FIR has been lodged under Sections 341, 342, 380, 406, 420, 306, 506 and 120B of IPC.

SSP Sharma said a four-member Patna police team has reached Mumbai to collect relevant documents found during the investigations conducted by the Mumbai police in the case so far. “Sushant’s father has urged Patna police to investigate the case, alleging that Mumbai police was not conducting the probe properly. Singh also alleged that Mumbai police never contacted him in connection with the case,” the SSP said.

In the FIR, a copy of which is with TOI, Singh has accused Rhea, her family members and known associates of cheating his son for financial gains by keeping him confined and under pressure, which finally led to his death. He has also alleged that Rhea used to put condition that Sushant would work in only those films in which she gets the lead actress role.

“Rhea got him shifted to a resort from his residence in Mumbai after coming close to her. She told him that his house was haunted. She used to tell Sushant that he talked weird things and needed treatment for mental health. She pressurised him to stay there even after my daughter tried to bring him back,” Singh alleged.

“Rhea later got him shifted to her residence in Mumbai where Sushant was given an overdose of medicines. She informed everyone that Sushant was suffering from dengue, which he never had,” Singh alleged in the FIR.

He alleged that Rhea and her family members used to keep Sushant’s cellphone, got his trusted staff and employees changed and hired those who were known to her only “so that to control everything”.

“Rhea also got Sushant’s cellphone number changed. He was provided with a new sim card issued in the name of one Samial Miranda, who was close to Rhea,” he stated in the FIR. “Sushant had told him on several occasions that he was unable to do anything as they all wanted to put him in a mental asylum. A sum of Rs15 crore was transferred from one of the Sushant’s bank accounts to other bank accounts with which he had nothing to do,” Singh alleged and asked the police to probe his son’s bank accounts and credit cards to know how much he was duped of by Rhea, her relatives and others known to her.

Singh also said Sushant wanted to leave film industry and shift to Coorg in Kerala for organic farming. He was also looking for land, but Rhea stopped him by threatening that she would reveal his medical documents to media to declare him mad and destroy him through her connections.

Sushant’s father also alleged that Rhea left his residence with laptop, cash, jewellery, credit cards, documents related to his treatment on June 8 after Sushant opposed her and sensing that his bank balance had diminished. “After his former manager Disha’s suicide, Sushant feared that Rhea might get him implicated in the case. He called Rhea multiple times, but she had blocked his number. It was Rhea who had got Disha hired for Sushant,” Singh alleged.

Singh said he tried to talk to Sushant on multiple occasions while being in Patna, but Rhea, her family members and other associates neither allowed it nor let his son return to Patna.

Speaking with TOI, police commissioner Vishwas Nangare Patil said he is in process of issuing a circular cautioning residential societies of legal action in case any complaint in this context is lodged with the police.

“We have received few complaints about residential societies not allowing outsiders from other districts inside the society complex although they travel with valid e-passes. So far we have refrained from taking any legal action. However, if anyone is travelling with valid passes no one can stop him from reaching the final destination. We would not tolerate such harassment,” the commissioner said.

According to him, the police have so far not come across any instance of harassment of Covid patients or their family members by society members.

“But on our part we would be cautioning all residents of residential societies so that such incidents do not take place in the future. In fact all of us must stand in solidarity with those infected and their families to make them mentally strong so that they are able to win the battle against Covid-19,” he said.

Nangare Patil also appealed to the citizens to wear masks and follow the physical distancing norm. The senior IPS officer said the police is focusing on the containment zones to restrict movement of the people. There are around 351 containment zones across the city.

The mortality rate of the district is also one of the highest in the state.What’s surprising is that the district administration, instead of utilising the infrastructure of the near-complete super-specialty hospital in the town, is spending around Rs 9 crore to convert a warehouse complex near Ramnepalle village into a Covid care centre.Sources said only five per cent of work remains to be completed to make the five-storied super-specialty hospital operational. But instead of asking the contractor to complete the work, officials are readying the 1,500-bed temporary facility.Social activist and Praja Science Vedika convenor Dr Suresh Babu urged the district administration to set its focus on completion of the big healthcare facility instead of splurging on a temporary facility. “It will require around Rs 15-20 crore to complete the pending work. The super-specialty hospital is a 350-bed facility and a permanent structure. Another centre could be readied if required later on. The hospital is located within the city and will help people get there easily,” he said.He criticised the district administration for wasting four months since the outbreak of Covid-19. “The contractor should have been given a deadline to finish the work. Senior officials have been promising to complete the hospital for the past four months and convert it into a dedicated Covid-19 hospital. Unfortunately, it is yet to be completed even as positive cases in the district have crossed the 10,000-mark,” he added.",vijayawada,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-47529300,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-110164,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/anantapur-dist-to-get-1-5k-bed-covid-centre/articleshow/77228116.cms

“Our dad uses a laptop, mom uses another and we have to share one old model which is slow. It’s hard enough to pay attention to lessons all day. Sharing devices means we always have a backlog,” said Shruti.

With online classes going on for four months now, students are getting stressed, mainly because of slow or inadequate devices. While students may have access to the online lessons, not having a conducive device and environment to study is causing stress.

Lakshmi Vijayakumar, a psychiatrist, said in households that don’t have enough devices, there is a constant tussle between siblings, especially when all have to attend online classes.

“Unconsciously, one sibling is favoured and given the bigger or better device and the other ends up straining the eyes and ends up having a lot of stress,” she said.

There is also pressure from teachers on attendance and timely submission of assignments. But when a household has only one laptop, it adds to stress among students.

“At our home, there are three children. But they end up having fights every day on who gets the better device,” said Deepa Ranganathan, a homemaker from K K Nagar.

A survey from a thinktank Centre for Budget and Governance Accountability (CBGA) says 73% of respondents are sharing devices with their parents nd 23% don’t get sufficient time. As a result, only 47% of the respondents are happy with their classes.

Platforms such as Ventallout have counsellors helping students who are stressed. “They come at a very nominal cost starting from Rs 49. We help them cope with the stress,” said Sunil Mittal, co founder, Ventallout.

However, when asked for details of quarantine fees charged, he stated that the fees are being charged by respective establishments, details of which are not maintained by his department, the NRI department.

Since the pandemic, a total of 11,067 stranded Goans have returned, Sawant said responding to queries. Over 70% of these were seafarers. Of these, 7,939 seafarers entered Goa directly and via other parts of India while two cruise ships brought back nearly 2,000 of them directly from Greece and Italy.

Only a miniscule 11% of stranded Goans were repatriated directly to Goa on nine Vande Bharat flights from UAE, Oman, Kuwait, UK and other countries.

60% were repatriated via 35 direct charter flights from Italy, UAE, Sri Lanka, Qatar, Brazil, UK, Philippines, Mongolia, Netherlands, Germany, Barbados, Kuwait, Oman, Cayman Islands and Saudi Arabia.

When asked for details of jobless people who applied to return, Sawant said the data is unavailable.

He told the assembly that a total of 6,544 Goans have registered their names on the NRI portal www.nri.goa.gov.in, of which 6,097 have indicated their wish to return to Goa. Further, he said that details of those who registered on the portal were collected with a confidentiality clause and hence, cannot be disclosed in the public domain.

When asked about the state’s initiative to bring back stranded OCI card holders, Sawant said details of stranded OCI card holders and Portuguese passport holders are not maintained separately and that their repatriation is the subject matter of the central government.

“The question of repatriation by the government of Goa does not arise,” he stated.

Data of the total number of foreigners repatriated and the amount spent on them are also not maintained by the state government, he said in the assembly.

A doctor from KIMS, Hubballi, assisted them through a video call.

Vasavi Pathepur of Kittur Chennamma Street was due by the end of July, but she developed labour pain at 2.3pm on Sunday. Unfortunately, all efforts to get an ambulance during the lockdown went in vain.

Sources said as Hanagal taluk hospital was sealed after a nurse tested positive for Covid-19, Vasavi, who was writhing in pain, did not get a vehicle. Hearing her cries, her neighbour Jyoti Madi and other women rushed to her house.

“I immediately called my neighbour Dr Priyanka Mantagi, who is pursuing MD in Hubballi KIMS, and explained to her the condition of Vasavi. The doctor said she would guide us through a video call and gave us courage to assist Vasavi,” said Jyoti, a techie, who works in Bengaluru and stays in Hangal now.

Without wasting time, the women swung into action. They followed the doctor’s instructions and finally, succeeded in aiding a safe delivery. “We managed to save two lives with the timely help of Dr Priyanka. None of us had any experience of conducting deliveries earlier and this was possible because of the doctor’s encouragement,” she added.

Vasavi said she had lost all hopes when they failed to get an ambulance to reach other hospitals. “I thank my neighbours who showed exemplary courage and presence of mind to support me during the crisis,” she added.

Dr Priyanka Mantagi said she was confident and gave proper guidance over the phone. “All women supported and followed each instruction carefully that helped avoid complications. Vasavi had given birth to her first child through c-section, so there was a little risk involved. However, I was confident that the process will be normal. Both the mother and the child are doing fine,” Priyanka added.

457,['29/07/2020'],"Take cue from BSP govts to tackle crime in state, Mayawati tells Yogi","Lucknow: Commenting on the recent spate of murders and kidnappings in Uttar Pradesh, BSP chief Mayawati has advised chief minister Yogi Adityanath to take inspiration from her governments during which time, she said, law and order was much better.

Alleging that there was no rule of law in UP, where criminals had enforced a jungle raj, Mayawati said it would not help to make speeches and announcements. Instead the need was to get down on the ground and take strict decisions and implement them properly, she added.

“There is no shame in the government taking a few lessons on law and order implementation from the BSP governments, under whom every section of society was looked after and where rule of law was enforced by law. Nobody was harassed and if some crime did take place, immediate and strict action was taken so that the incident would not be repeated,” she said.

The former UP CM added that untouchability is still prevalent in UP, as was clear in the recent Agra incident where people did not allow the cremation of a Dalit woman in a crematorium which was meant for upper caste people. “This matter should be investigated at the highest level and exemplary action taken against the accused so that such an incident does not happen again,” she said.

Mayawati asked the Centre to intervene in the states where crime is high and seek monthly reports from them on steps being taken to establish the rule of law.

She also demanded that the Centre should frame a common law to combat Covid-19 and ensure its implementation across all states. The Centre will be announcing the rules for Unlock-3 anytime now and, Mayawati said, BSP has always supported the Centre on this issue, and also cooperated with it.

There is, however, uncertainty over the fate of flights from six cities, including Delhi, Mumbai and Chennai, to Kolkata that are currently banned. A question mark also hangs over international flights that are not allowed to land in Kolkata.“I was booked to travel on August 16 but will now have to reschedule the ticket since it is a lockdown date when fights won’t operate. Though it is still a hassle, it is much better than getting to know with less than a week to go. I now know the dates when travel won’t be disrupted,” said Kaushik Mukherjee, who works in a law firm.He and scores of other passengers booked to travel on dates on which lockdown was declared on Tuesday called up travel agents and airlines to make the necessary alterations in plans. At least three travel agents TOI spoke to said they would have their hands full till the end of the week to adjust clients’ travel schedules.Though flights had operated last Thursday, the first day of biweekly lockdown in the state, they were cancelled on Saturday. Trains though operated on Saturday, too, but will not operate on Wednesday and on all lockdown dates in August.“It’s good that the lockdown schedule for the entire month has been declared instead of just a week. This way, there is clarity that will help airlines schedule their flights, passengers book their tickets and us, the travel agents, offer confirmed bookings. I wish the state government had also announced its decision on international flights and flights from the six cities that currently cannot land in Kolkata or other airports in the state,” said Travel Agents’ Federation of India chairman (east) Anil Punjabi.Sources in the airport said the state was likely to seek an extension of the embargo on both international flights and domestic flights from the worst Covid-hit states. “We expect a communication from the civil aviation ministry in the next couple of days,” the official said.Though the second lockdown date in the current week had not been announced in advance, passengers and travel agents had worked out that it was unlikely to be on Thursday, Friday and Saturday and gone ahead with ticket bookings on these days. The reasoning was that Saturday being Eid and shopping possible only on Thursday and Friday, the state was unlikely to declare them as lockdown days.The lockdown was also initially considered on Monday (August 3) but shifted to Wednesday (August 5) to avoid inconvenience on Raksha Bandhan. Similarly, August 29 was initially considered a lockdown date but it was later shifted to August 31 as Muharram will be observed on the former date this year.",kolkata,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-77233595,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-377938,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/lockdown-calendar-a-relief-for-flyers-airlines/articleshow/77228136.cms

The ICMR guidelines allow family members in the crematoriums and burial grounds but ban any physical proximity to the body. The guidelines say rituals such as reading from religious scripts, sprinkling holy water and any other last rites that do not require touching of the body can be allowed. The guidelines ban large gathering at the crematorium and burial ground because it is possible that close family contacts may be infected.Rajya Sabha MP Shantanu Sen said, “Covid suspects are also treated as Covid positive cases as per guidelines.” In such cases, a body must be kept in a leak-proof plastic body bag. The exterior of the body bag must be decontaminated with 1% hypochlorite.Early last month, the state had issued a revised SOP to allow last rites for Covid patients. To allow family members of the deceased to pay their last respects, it had been directed that hospital authorities shall inform the family members within an hour of the death. A body cover with transparent face area shall be used. Mask and gloves will be provided to the family members by the hospital after proper sanitization and the body should be kept at a suitable place for 30 minutes during which the family members shall be allowed to pay their last respects.",kolkata,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-77238609,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-188052,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/for-covid-suspects-cremation-will-not-wait-for-test-reports/articleshow/77228129.cms
460,['29/07/2020'],"Lady Justice blindfolded, court can see: HC","Ahmedabad: The Gujarat high court warned litigants that they should not be mistaken that their half-truths can get them through litigation thinking that the statue of Lady Justice is blindfolded and courts cannot spot the truth if not told.

The bench of Chief Justice Vikram Nath and Justice Ashutosh Shastri made some important observations about the judiciary, that it can discern the truth from the blurred reality presented by parties. While dealing with the case of a sacked executive who levelled charges of sexual harassment after her superior abruptly fired her, the bench said, “Parties to any litigation before a court should not harbour the misconception that since the statue of Lady Justice is blindfolded, the justice system turns a blind eye to acts like prevarication, motivated falsehoods, collusion and the like. Using truth as a guiding star in the entire judicial process, is our mandate, obligation and bounden duty.”

The judges further observed, “Truth is the foundation of justice and that dispensation of justice, based on truth, is an essential feature in the justice delivery system. Truth is a mirage. It rests in the recesses of the human mind. What emerge are actions driven by the perplexities of emotion, judgment and perceptions. Examined on the touchstone of justice, courts evaluate facts as they emerge on record, proceeding to uphold or set aside these actions through judicial appraisal. It is not for courts to unravel the complexities of the human mind.”

The case involved a senior executive in the National Dairy Development Board (NDDB)-owned IDMC Ltd. She was employed on a hefty salary and promoted and her salary package continued to grow with ‘outstanding’ and ‘exceptional’ performance remarks till the general manager changed in 2017. With the new head, an inquiry was set up highlighting her alleged irregularities and failures and she was sacked without any explanation. The next day, she accused her boss of sexual harassment.

The woman approached the HC and a single-judge bench quashed her termination and ordered the company to reinstate her. The company then filed an appeal before the division bench, which castigated the company and the executive for coming before the court with half-truths. It quashed the decision to terminate the executive, the inquiry results and also rejected the woman’s charges of sexual harassment against the boss who had sacked her. The court said, “There appears to be concealment by both sides. While embarking on this quest for truth we have derived a gainful insight into human behaviour, mannerisms, motivations and many a subtle hues which go behind the decision making process.”

461,['29/07/2020'],KMC’s rapid test to start from Borough IX tomorrow,"KOLKATA: Kolkata Municipal Corporation (KMC) has decided to start rapid antigen test for Covid suspects from Thursday. This rapid test is capable of testing swab samples of 10 patients at a time and the results are known in half an hour, said a KMC senior health official .

Sources in the KMC health department said the facility (rapid testing) will be available at all KMC boroughs. “To begin with, we will arrange for testing Covid suspects in Kalighat, Chetla and Alipore, among other areas of Borough IX from Thursday. Next, we will extend the facility to people of all other boroughs,” said a KMC health department official.

The reason behind the introduction of rapid tests is to expedite the results so that patients who test positive may get more time for treatment. Now, the KMC health department conducts swab tests at Covid-sensitive zones every day. Swab samples are collected from the Covid suspects and are sent to SSKM for tests. SSKM then sends the test results to the state health department and the patient is finally intimated about the test after three-four days. “If a patient tests positive, this delay may prove costly. Under the rapid test method, we will intimate the patients about the results by an hour, which will be beneficial for positive patients,” said a civic official.

According to sources in the KMC health department, the civic body is planning to introduce rapid tests in some of the worst-hit Covid containment zones in next 15 days. “We are preparing a borough-wise list of worst containment zones where we will offer rapid tests to residents who have Covid symptoms,” the official said.

Some of the areas where the KMC health department will be conducting rapid test include Ultadanga-Kankurgachhi-Phoolbagan belt, Maniktala, Beliaghata, Burrabazar, Jorabagan, Jorasanko, Park Street, Park Circus, Ballygunge , Dhakuria, Kasba, Jadavpur , Tollygunge and Behala, among other areas. “We are searching for community halls and other places for conducting rapid tests across 16 boroughs,” a KMC health department official said on Tuesday.

462,['29/07/2020'],Board dissects performance of students in three subjects,"Panaji: For the first time, a dissection of the performance of nearly 19,000 students in the subjects of English, mathematics and science at the Class X exam has been carried out, by the Goa Board of Secondary and Higher Secondary Education. The students’ performance has been analysed section-wise to reveal areas where most tend to score better and sections where they are not able to fare well.

“This data will be shared with schools. Teachers can take remedial measures as per the findings and use this information to improve students’ performance further,” said board chairman Ramkrishna Samant.

Though the pass percentage in English, for instance, was 96.7%, the analysis has been carried out of students’ performance each question-wise to identify the common weak and strength areas. “We have worked out a graph based on how students have fared in a particular question. In question number two in the English language paper, for example, many students have scored 10 out of 10. The question was related to a tree diagram. But in question number ten, which is ‘article writing’, many have secured 30%-50%, which means it is a difficult area. Very few have secured 100% in question number ten,” said board secretary Bhagirath Shetye. The analysis showed that most students did well in grammar.

“The overall pass percentage in science is 94.1%. In this subject, question number four included questions on periodic classification of elements, heredity, carbon and its compounds, and how do organisms reproduce. Looking at the analysis, it seems possible that many students did not understand these concepts well. This is where students and teachers will have to do well,” said Shetye.

He said that most students had also only ‘moderately understood’ concepts of electricity, human eye and colorful world and magnetic effects of electric current.

In mathematics, he said that students, for instance, had done well in ‘circle and construction’ chapter. But they had not done too well in the chapter on ‘area related to circle and surface area and volume’, which, Shetye said, is a question which requires application.

Several patients complained that many private clinics and small hospitals are closed, while those that are open are reluctant to treat non-Covid-19 cases.A senior citizen recently admitted to a small private hospital near Zilla Parishad Junction for age-related complications had to vacate after hospital authorities were instructed to partially convert the institution into a Covid-19 Care Centre. Along with the senior citizen, some other patients with chronic but non-emergency ailments had to look for an alternative.Special officer for Covid-19 (north-coastal AP) Dr PV Sudhakar said that of the 218 hospitals registered under the District Medical and Health Office (DMHO), 33 have been selected for Covid-19 care as category A hospitals (entirely dedicated to Covid-19 treatment) or as category B hospitals (partially dedicated to Covid-19 treatment). “Around 180 hospitals are free to do electives or smaller surgeries and other non-Covid-19 cases. Hospitals with less than 50 beds or the smaller hospitals have not been converted to Covid-19 care institutes.”However, president of Andhra Pradesh Private Hospitals and Nursing Homes Association (APNA)-Vizag chapter, Dr Padmavathi Naidu, said, “The problems faced by non-Covid-19 patients are going to escalate in future. Even minor, elective surgeries cannot be postponed indefinitely as it would give rise to complications if delayed inordinately. Some clinics have closed down since the lockdown. In smaller hospitals and nursing homes under APNA, around 80% of staff, including paramedics and class IV staff, have stopped coming fearing Covid-19. So with severe staff crunch and the pandemic around, non-Covid-19 elective patients are facing a tough time.”",visakhapatnam,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-77228138,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-49351,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/non-covid-treatment-takes-a-backseat/articleshow/77228139.cms

The reason for their optimism is the fact that the number of cases has dropped in the past 48 hours.

The civic body said positive cases have reduced in the city due to the rise in the number of tests, early detection and timely treatment. NMC officials said they are conducting 2,000 tests per day and the positivity rate per 100 swabs/tests has reduced from 20% to 10%. The NMC is confident that the trend of positive cases will reverse within the next eight-10 days.

The state health panel had visited Nashik city early in July to review the Covid-19 scenario and had projected the rise in the number of positive cases to 10,000. So far, the NMC has had 7,919 positive cases and 253 deaths. Also, 5,970 patients have recovered. Currently, the city has 1,696 active patients.

“The number of cases has reduced in the past two days. We are expecting the case-count to reach 8,700 by July 31. We are optimistic that the trend will reverse in the next 10 days,” said NMC officials.

“We have started tracing suspected cases in the slums and containment areas. We are also taking the help of a social organization that has provided 20 mobile clinics for check-up of residents and antigen tests,” they said. Currently, we are conducting 2,000 daily tests, including 1,500 antigen tests and 500 RT-PCR tests.

He said that he has trained his focus on winning 150 seats in the 2022 assembly polls.

Q: Did you ever imagine that you would head the state BJP as ‘Savaya Gujarati?’

A: Frankly never. I was overwhelmed when informed that I was being entrusted with such a big responsibility. For a few moments, I did not know how to react. Only in the BJP is it possible for a grassroots worker like me, without any caste base, to be elevated to such a position.

Q: Although you have an excellent grip of politics in South Gujarat, you have had limited exposure in Central Gujarat, Saurashtra, and North Gujarat. How will you address that?

A: It is true that I have not worked much beyond South Gujarat. But the BJP’s team is very strong across the state and its organization is robust. I will shortly visit all the areas of the state. For me, the BJP worker anywhere is most important person of the party and my role is to ensure that we use this strength for improving the party’s prospects.

Q: BJP got only 99 seats in the 2017 assembly elections, its worst performance in recent years. How many seats do you expect in 2022?

A: The BJP has bounced backed strongly after the 2017 assembly elections and I am sure it will win 150 seats in 2022.

Q: The BJP is considered to be struggling in the run-up to the eight assembly byelections and the upcoming panchayat polls.

A: No, we are confident of winning all eight assembly seats and will perform better in the panchayat elections than we did in 2015.

Q: You talked about taking central and state government schemes to people in a big way. How do you propose to do that?

A: I have done it my Lok Sabha constituency where we prepared a database of beneficiaries and our workers reached out to them. The same model will be replicated across the state.

Q: You talked about the use of technology when you took over. What are your plans?

A: Since we cannot organize mass gatherings, we will adopt a mix of technologies to reach the masses.

Q: Is the BJP facing factionalism like the Congress?

A: It is not true. There is a fundamental difference between us and the Congress.

Q: How do you view the ongoing leadership issues in the Gujarat Congress after Hardik Patel’s appointment?

A: It is an internal matter of the Congress. For us, the Congress is just a political opponent.

Q: The 2015 local body polls and 2017 assembly elections were held under the shadow of caste-based agitations. Will the focus now be on Hindutva and development?

A: Our focus was development and it will always be so. The BJP has delivered on its promise of building the Ram Mandir and people will certainly appreciate our commitment. We have fulfilled people’s expectations on the Ram Mandir and that will certainly help us in the 2022 elections.

Q: There are speculations that your appointment is linked with the BJP’s plan to regain power in Maharashtra. You are a Maharashtrian leader in Gujarat. What is your view?

A: I cannot comment on Maharashtra.

Q: Do you have plans to bring in more Congress leaders?

A: I do not see the need to do so. Our workers must be stronger than any Congress leader. This will be our strategy in the coming days.

Q: How do you view CM Vijay Rupani’s four years in power?

A: The CM’s four years have been very successful and he has provided good leadership.

Q: There are speculations that the CM and the cabinet will be changed.

A: Nothing like that is happening. People are trying to spread rumours.

He also got an earful from seniors that next time he ditched a mask, he would be marked absent.It was when he explained that he was wearing a Japanese anti-Covid lanyard, they were able to breathe easy. However, their peace was short-lived as one of them found the device to be fake.After counterfeit sanitizers and masks, these Japan-made ‘virus shut out cards’ being sold in a few markets like Krishnanagar and Chowk are cashing on the fear of people by falsely claiming that it kills 99.9% virus and bacteria in the air.The ‘virus shut out card’ is a lanyard with chlorine dioxide , a compound used for fumigation and disinfecting water. Priced at Rs 120, they are also available on leading e-commerce sites though with a higher price tag. With a shelf life of 60 days, it claims to restrict the virus within one-metre radius.The description on the product says, “It effectively blocks airborne particles, bacteria and all types of epidemic viruses, reducing the chance of being infected or infecting others. It is suitable for everyone, especially people with low immunity, kids, elderly and those exposed to hospitals.”Many officials in the district administration and police have been spotted wearing the virus shut out card.Talking to TOI, head of microbiology department at SGPGI, Dr TN Dhole, termed the virus shut out card as “completely bogus”.“On the contrary, it can have adverse effect on human body like watery eyes, skin irritation and coughing. How can you expect this card to block coronavirus which is spread from person to person when a patient with Covid-19 coughs or exhales? It’s against the measures being adopted for preventing the spread of Covid-19... Nothing can stop the virus in humid climate,” Dr Dhole said.“There’s no substitute to masks. Anti-Covid cards are not authorized and people should be wary of products promising to nip the virus in the bud,” president of IMA Lucknow, Dr Rama Srivastava, said.“Nobody should trust these devices unless the government puts a stamp of approval on them,” she added.Former IMA national president and Padma Shri awardee KK Agarwal said: “These portable air purifiers claim to disinfect the air as the user moves around. But there is no alternative to masks. This device can be used in addition to masks.”Doctors said these devices offer no protection since gas dissipates fast, especially outdoors, where the air is moving. If someone is sneezing at you, the device won’t be able to kill all the virus particles in droplets in a fraction of a second, they said. On May 15, the Japanese consumer affairs agency had warned people that the product was ineffective against Covid-19.The card has been banned in several countries, including the US, Thailand and the Philippines.",lucknow,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-77236613,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-174671,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/covid-lanyard-may-cause-you-more-harm-than-good/articleshow/77230314.cms

BENGALURU: With Covid-19 patients battling stress, the state government has resorted to board games – quite literally – to help them exorcise their fears. Asymptomatic patients at the newly established Covid Care Centre (CCC) at Veterinary College, Hebbal, have been provided carrom boards to keep them occupied.

The 280-bed CCC was inaugurated by housing minister V Somanna on Monday. The minister played a game of carroms to mark the opening. Facilities such as television and space for yoga sessions have been provided in a bid to help patients beat the stress.

Speaking to TOI later, Somanna said, “There are people dying of heart attacks and committing suicide immediately on knowing they have been infected and many go into shock. We are trying to ensure their stay at CCCs is be panic-free. To ease fears, we have put in many carrom boards so that they can play and relieve the stress.”

He went on to say, “We will establish another five or six CCCs across the city soon to treat asymptomatic patients. We are aiming to do it constituency wise which will help patients as well. MLAs and corporators can also supervise things in their respective wards which will ease pressure on existing facilities like BIEC CCC.”

478,['29/07/2020'],Report: Action against fake teachers is not satisfactory,"Lucknow: Action taken against fake teachers identified by SIT and STF during a document-verification drive in 20 districts is far below satisfactory, showed a progress report issued by the basic education department.

Districts that took measures like issuing recovery notices to sacked teachers didn’t get support from their divisional offices—a cause of major worry—as pointed out by the state project director for Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan Vijay Kiran Anand in the report.

Last month, several imposters were found working in Kasturba Gandhi Balika Vidyalayas, residential schools for girls from weaker sections, on the basis of academic records of one Anamika Shukla.

On June 15, chief minister Yogi Adityanath had ordered a statewide drive by a dedicated team to check documents of government teachers across the state. Since then, all three education departments—basic, secondary and higher—have been verifying the academic records of their teachers.

According to the report, districts where action taken was not up to the mark include Agra, Mainpuri, Ayodhya, Ambedkar Nagar, Mau, Azamgarh, Ballia, Aligarh, Kasganj, Etah, Basti, Sant Kabir Nagar, Siddharthnagar, Balrampur, Kushinagar, Baghpat, Meerut, Bulandshahr, Bijnor and Rampur.

A quick review of KGBVs showed that in 21 districts—Prayagraj, Rae Bareli, Aligarh, Mathura, Meerut and Unnao to name a few—many posts were vacant. The enrolment of girls in KGBVs in as many as 56 districts was reported not satisfactory. Directions have been issued to BSAs and district coordinators (girls’ education) in these districts. In KGBVs in 29 districts, only 50% teachers are attending school.

The report, based on video interaction and feedback from assistant directors (basic education) on various departmental schemes and activities, found that over 60% schools in 25 districts have not started any work under Operation Kayakalp, a mission by the Yogi-led government to improve infrastructure in government schools.

Gorakhpur, Amethi, Kanpur, and Lucknow are among them.

The pace of work under Operation Kayakalp was reported absolutely unsatisfactory in 12 districts, including Prayagraj, Gorakhpur, Gonda and Agra. The Centre in 2017 had issued a National School Safety Policy but in UP no monitoring was done at divisional level into the work by districts.

“As per the India State of Forest Report 2019, released by Forest Survey of India (FSI), Dehradun, the forest cover of Goa is 2,237sqkm out of which 1,225sqkm is recorded as forest area,” Sawant stated in a written reply in the assembly.

According to the report, forest area is area recorded as forest in government records, which is also referred to as “recorded forest area”, whereas forest cover refers to all lands, more than one hectare in area, with a tree canopy density of more than 10%, irrespective of ownership and legal status and such lands may not necessarily be a recorded forest area. It also includes orchards, bamboo and palm.

Speaking on private forests, Sawant said that the demarcated area for these as on date is 41.20sqkm and an additional 3.87sqkm has been identified by the committee headed by joint secretary revenue, but it is subjudice.

He said another 32.29sqkm area, provisionally identified by Thomas and Araujo Committee, is under review by the committee headed by chief conservator of forests.

Sawant said that the taluka-wise details of forest areas are not maintained by the forest department.

The chief minister said that a draft management policy for private forest was sent to the Union environment ministry for approval in July 2015, but the ministry did not approve it. He said that the ministry in its reply said that it is not feasible to permit any non-forestry activities in private forest without obtaining requisite permission under the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980.

Sawant said that there is no parcel of land that has been taken out from private forests on provisional basis.

The actors visited Kodaikanal without obtaining e-passes, which have been made mandatory for inter-district travel in Tamil Nadu during the lockdown. Vimal is native of a village near Manapparai in Trichy district while Soori is a native of Madurai.

The two had visited a few places in Kodaikanal with the help of some locals. They were caught by forest department officials for trespassing into restricted forest areas and imposed a fine of Rs 2,000 each.

Forest sources said the duo had been involved in fishing in the Berijam lake located in the upper parts of the hills.

Locals said forest department officials had gone soft on the actors, as there were instances where fine for trespassing went up to Rs 40,000.

They have urged officials to ensure that no one reaches the hill station without e-pass. Although the first Covid-19 case was reported only in the first week of June, ever since the number has been increased rapidly now with around 150 reported so far.

Kodaikanal deputy superintendent of police Aathmanathan said the duo were booked under two sections for visiting without an e-pass and act likely to spread infection.

Police sources said the cases against the actors were bailable in nature and there was no need to arrest them.

The duo visited the hill station on July 17. However, the incident came to the notice of locals only a week later, after the photos of the actors were shared on social media.

490,['29/07/2020'],"Tiger boom in 3 reserves, areas outside PAs show good recovery","Nagpur: Tiger reserves and sanctuaries in the state are well on their way to recovery with Maharashtra’s tiger numbers going up by 122 in the last four years. Tadoba leads the way with a count rise of 32 taking its tally to 83.

The non-protected areas of Chandrapur district together account for 93 tigers.

The final report of All India Tiger Estimation (AITE)-2018 was released on Tuesday, the eve of Global Tiger Day, a year after the summary report was released by Prime Minister Narendra Modi. This report assesses the status of tigers in terms of spatial occupancy and density of individual populations across India.

From 190 tigers in 2014, parks in Maharashtra recorded 312 tigers with analysis pegging 270 as the lower limit and 354 as the upper limit. The jump is a whopping 64%.

“The number has increased as the four-year estimation exercise was conducted for the first time in some parks like Tipeshwar and Umred-Karhandla, and also in territorial areas of Central Chanda and Chandrapur divisions,” said principal chief conservator of forests (wildlife) Nitin H Kakodkar.

“Another major reason for the surge is the dispersal of tigers from PAs to territorial areas, and tigers adopting semi-urban and human-dominated landscapes and mining areas. They have also occupied dense green patches inside Chandrapur Super Thermal Power Station. Voluntary relocation is also one of the reasons,” said Kakodkar.

As these forests serve as sink habitats to dispersing tigers from Tadoba, Kakodkar said, “The report virtually supports our idea that managing conflict in forests having human habitation, and removing conflict tigers in a timely manner is the crux of preventing retaliation.”

On flared up man-animal conflicts in Tadoba landscape, the report states, “A swift, dispassionate, and professional removal of problem individual tigers — as per the protocols of National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA) — is essential to permit long-term tiger occupancy in this forest-agriculture-pasture mosaic and prevent community retaliation towards the population and species as a whole.”

On the stagnant tiger number of 6-7 in over 650sqkm Nagzira-Navegaon Tiger Reserve (NNTR), Kakodkar said, “We will analyse things and take corrective steps. Wildlife Institute of India (WII) will do a study on whether rise in wild dog numbers is responsible for low tiger numbers.”

Barring NNTR (6) and Sahyadri (3), PAs have shown good tiger recovery. Melghat, which had 25 tigers in 2014, recorded 46 tigers. Tadoba, which had 51 tigers has recorded 83 tigers in 2018, and Pench, which had 35 tigers, now has 53 tigers.

The report has introduced a new column about tigers utilizing the tiger reserves and actual number of tigers within the reserves. There is a huge gap between both the numbers. For instance, 82 tigers have been show as utilizing tiger reserve in Pench, but the actual figure is 53.

“In some tiger reserves like Pench, Bandipur, Madumalai, and Satyamangalam, individual tigers could be double counted. These double counts are accounted for in estimating the tiger population at the landscape and state scale. In order to minimize double count of tigers, the estimate of ‘tigers within tiger reserves’ is to be used,” WII scientist & AITE coordinator YV Jhala said.

As per the report, Tadoba maintained highest tiger density at 6.09 tigers per 100sqkm, followed by 4.87 tigers in Umred-Karhandla, 4.64 tigers in Pench, 2.50 tigers in Tipeshwar, 2.60 in Chandrapur, 2.50 tigers in Bramhapuri, 2.09 in Central Chanda territorial divisions and 1.49 tigers in Melghat.

“This indicates that tiger density is good in three territorial divisions of Chandrapur, better than what it is in several tiger-bearing PAs where crores are being spent on tiger conservation. So, it is high time that more focus is given to these areas,” said Bandu Dhotre, Eco-Pro founder.

State wildlife board member Kishor Rithe said, “NTCA has rated tiger reserves in Brown, Yellow and Red category as per the tigers and prey density. Of the 50 reserves in the country, 4 from Maharashtra — Bor, Pench, NNTR and Tadoba — were rated Brown. Strong efforts by the department have increased tiger occupancy in the region.”

CHENNAI: Nearly 430 families living along the northern side of Cooum at Sathyavani Muthu Nagar are exposed to risk of flooding should it rain heavily in the coming days.

Rehabilitation process of the slum dwellers has been halted due to the pandemic. So far, 1,663 families have been shifted to Perumbakkam.

One of the residents, M Muniyan, said if the river overflows, water will enter houses close to the bank.

An official involved in the rehabilitation process said when Chennai River Restoration Trust (CRRT), Public Works Department (PWD) and Greater Chennai Corporation wanted to evacuate the area before March, a section of residents opposed saying 100-plus children were about to appear for board exams. “They wanted them to write the exam before being shifted. This they got time from the authorities but then the pandemic hit,” he said.

S Ramakrishnan, another resident, said with rain comes dengue. “Last time it rained, slum dwellers had dengue. We want to leave Sathyavani Muthu Nagar for the Perumbakkam tenements,” he said.

A senior PWD official said banks on the downstream of Cooum have been cleared of encroachments and bunds built or strengthened. “Due to these efforts the river is wider now. But the corporation and CRRT in coordination with the Slum Clearance Board should start the evacuation work before the onset of heavy rain in the city,” he said.

A corporation official said they have completed enumeration and a biometric survey based on which the Slum Clearance Board has allocated tenements in the new area.

493,['29/07/2020'],Mayawati: Why’s BSP chief Mayawati breaking ranks with Opposition to be soft on BJP?,"LUCKNOW: It didn't come as a surprise when BSP chief Mayawati directed her six MLAs to vote against the Ashok Gehlot-led Congress government in Rajasthan -- a government she had extended outside support to when it was formed less than two years ago -- in case of a floor test.Although her ties with the Congress are on a downswing since the 2018 assembly elections in MP and Rajasthan when the grand old party kept her waiting for a tie-up and eventually dumped BSP, of late she has almost broken ranks with the opposition to back the BJP-led Central government on issues like stand-off with China. At the same time, she is belligerent towards Congress, especially Rajasthan CM Gehlot, who she accuses of 'stealing her MLAs' and has demanded the President's Rule in Rajasthan.Rajasthan crisis: Live updatesExplaining her party’s decision to issue a whip to its Rajathan MLAs, all of whom defected to Congress in September 2019 and are unlikely to follow the party diktat, Mayawati on Tuesday said: “Chori ka saman chori hone par shor macha rahe hein (They are screaming after what they stole has been stolen by another). There was a conspiracy against BSP in Rajasthan in which Gehlot was involved. If the MLAs do not follow our directions, we will take the matter of their disqualification to the Supreme Court,” she said in apparent reference to Sachin Pilot's revolt, calling Congress the original thief and asking why the party high command was quiet about it.""BSP has taken this decision after being cheated by Congress multiple times and whether their government stays or not, will be directly Congress’ fault,"" she said. Mayawati also addressed the criticism of her party for indirectly supporting BJP but before she reminded Congress of her support to its government, she said that as a national party, whichever party BSP aligned with, even if it was BJP, it would be for the benefit of her party and the Dalit movement.In 2018, BSP and Congress were exploring the possibility of contesting assembly elections in Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh, together but the deal never went through. Despite this, BSP supported the Congress in all states where it won in forming the government, saying that it was doing so to keep “communal forces out of power”.However, in the middle of the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, the BSP candidate contesting against Jyotiraditya Scindia in GUna joined Congress, followed by all six BSP MLAs in Rajasthan moving to Congress in September 2019, leaving a very bitter Mayawati in their wake.Mayawati’s attack against Congress has intensified over the past few months, with party insiders pointing out that in most states, the two parties share the same vote bank. “Even when there was a scope for a tie-up between them, like the 2018 assembly elections, Congress kept BSP hanging and refused to accede to any of Mayawati’s demands. Now, we are at a point that even if BJP does something wrong, Mayawati will either hold Congress guilty for it or just lightly admonish BJP,” said a senior BSP member. In June, while India and China clashed at the border, Mayawati said that her party would always side with the government on issues related to the country's welfare and security and that decisions regarding the country’s security should be left to the government. On the management of the Covid-19 pandemic , in which Mayawati has appeared to be largely satisfied with the Centre’s response, she had once asked Opposition parties to “show maturity” and work together with the Centre for the world to see.When the migrant crisis erupted, as lakhs lost jobs during the Covid-19 lockdown and many of them started heading to their home states on foot, Mayawati blames Congress for the situation. From a bitter battle against the ruling party in 2018 when it contested the Lok Sabha polls in alliance with the Samajwadi Party , the BSP chief has come a long way, having said that she will not criticise the government for the sake of criticism and will provide issue based support to it.“We have never contested an election with BJP because our ideologies are different. Contesting elections and forming a government together are two different things,” she said in June this year, holding the failure of Congress as the reason for the formation of BSP.Criticism of BJP is not absent, but often ends with an “advice” to its government to take corrective measures, “There is no longer any stinging criticism of BJP. Mayawati mostly expresses her opinion on an issue through tweets which give the impression that she is still in the Opposition but rarely do they actually hit out at the government,” said a party insider. She has been quiet about the law and order situation in UP and when she tweeted about it, she came with an advice to follow her.""Mayawati's BSP has run a government in tie-up with the BJP thrice in the past but has never had a pre poll alliance. On the other hand, BSP and Congress have contested together once in the past but have never run a government together in UP. Besides, her tie-up with the other leading party, SP, has already ended on a bitter note. So maybe she wants to keep BJP in good humour to keep her chances in 2022 elections alive,"" says a political analyst.",lucknow,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-77233537,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-395671,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/whys-maya-breaking-ranks-with-opposition-to-be-soft-on-bjp/articleshow/77230337.cms

MOHALI: A 75-year-old former Air Force warrant officer got stuck in a lift at Purab Premium Apartments for 30 minutes. Mohan Singh, a resident of Block C-8 and lives on the 11th floor , went to a local market to buy medicines for his wife.

When he came back, he told his wife to tell their son to come downstairs and pick-up the stuff from the vehicle. But, he himself went upstairs to his residence.

“He was alone and he took the lift. When the lift reached the third floor, the electricity went off and my husband was stuck. The fan turned off and his phone didn’t have any signal. It was a nightmare for all of us,” said 65-year-old Raj Kaur, who came running to the 3rd floor from the 11th floor.

She said she tried to contact residents of the society, but in vain following which she called up the officials of the Greater Mohali Area Development Authority (Gmada), but they refused to help and instead told them to lodge a complaint.

496,['29/07/2020'],"Community spread on, but no contact tracing now: MLA","Madurai: Tamil Nadu government should acknowledge that the state has gone into stage three (community transmission) of Covid-19 virus infection, instead of denying it, Thiruparakundram DMK MLA P Saravanan said on Tuesday. He also said that steps should be taken to increase testing in the state, as only 168 out of the more than 360 labs had got ICMR nod to conduct testing.

Speaking to reporters in Madurai, he alleged that contact tracing was not done now, unlike earlier. Hundreds of people attend funerals of Covid victims, but they were not being tested.

Insisting that there was community transmission, he cited how a 60-year-old man in Pannikondan village in his constituency, who had no travel history or come in contact with any positive person, tested positive for Covid-19 and was bedridden.

“In Madurai, there are five testing centres, of which only the Madurai Medical College is a government facility, while the rest are private. This is leading to delayed results. If all 360 plus laboratories in the state are equipped for testing, many more tests could be done,” Saravanan said.

He also charged the government of gross mismanagement and deliberate attempt to conceal the 444 deaths in Chennai to fudge numbers. “Due to the mismanagement of the disease, the positive cases and death rate could be much higher than what is being declared in the state bulletins,” he said.

Rapid testing kits, which were not encouraged in Tamil Nadu, have an 80% accuracy rate, while the RT PCR kits have only 70% accuracy, he added. Hence, rapid kits should be used, as it could speed up the testing. “The delay in publishing results could lead to severity of the disease,” he said.

Stating that the government was asking private hospitals to participate in Covid treatment, he said there was a big shortfall in the availability of lifesaving drugs like remdesivir. “The government should make drugs available at affordable cost,” the MLA said.
