The coronavirus pandemic has turned as we knew it on its head and ushered in lifestyle changes that many would argue, should have been the norm aeons ago. Personal hygiene has become the focus , we’ve learnt to cough/sneeze into our elbows or disposable tissues and stopped spitting anywhere and everywhere, among others. The more radical changes, though, were, for most of us, scenes out of sci-fi or heist movies until not long ago. A masked face that was hitherto either about a scientific disaster, space trip or robbery, is now our new normal. Who would have thought you could ever wear a mask to a bank? We’ve stopped pushing and shoving in public places, learnt to maintain queues with adequate distancing and also realised that we don’t have to run to thehospital OPD for the slightest discomfort. The list goes on. Lessons and learnings are aplenty from the pandemic, but the fact remains that we are all now embracing our new normal.",bengaluru,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-75924112,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-89091,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/bengaluru-limps-back-to-normalcy-with-new-norms/articleshow/75924112.cms
2,['24/05/2020'],Home buds or work buds? How WFH culture rewrites work ethics among couples,"Having meals together

Extra time to chat and be with each other

Helps to be there for their kids

‘Bunking’ work to sneak in some TV time or a nap

Sharing household chores

Not having to deal with ridiculous traffic

Lockdown has brought about a few strange changes in our lives, with the work from home (WFH) culture being the biggest case in point. Take Smitha’s household for instance. While she teaches an architecture course to college students from a room, a few metres away, her husband, Karthik heads an adtech company.This has become the new normal, says the couple , who has been working from under the same roof for the past two months. Is the WFH culture an exciting addition to their lives? Or is it putting a dampner on personal relationships? Home-buds-turned-work-buds give us some answers.Separate workspaces and staying informed about each other’s scheduled meetings make life easy. “We both believe in not working on weekends. This was challenged during the lockdown because clients and colleagues are apparently working without a sense of day and time as both aspects are, understandably, fuzzy right now, so we were forced to establish boundaries with them to retain our weekends and weeknights,” Smitha reveals.Sreeja Nair, a young mother of a three-year-old, adds that separate bedrooms often turn into makeshift workspaces. “If we were staying in a smaller house, things would have been even more difficult,” she says, adding that barring the division of household chores, the WFH culture has been a refreshing change.“This has made us understand each other’s work ethic. Initially, when he would say that he was working late, I would not really know how much pressure he was in. But now that we are working together, we are able to appreciate how hard both of us are working,” she adds.From screaming toddlers to awkward attire malfunctions, WFH brings about its own set of amusing moments. “My husband’s team has a lot of fun activities like playing antakshari and film quiz on Teams. One such day, he began singing randomly without realising that I was on an office call,” laughs Shrinika, a media professional.Mixing toddlers and work, too, is not such a good idea, says Arjun, a finance professional, half-jokingly. “While it can be maddening working round the clock, our daughter Amyra brings in humour to our lives. While we are busy on calls, she sits next to us and sings loudly,” he adds.As with everything else, the workspace that we once knew has likely been turned on its head. Karthik, who was wary of remote working initially, is accepting its upsides now. “A few days into my WFH schedule, I used to sleep in the afternoons and would also take long lunch breaks. But that is not the case anymore. Having another person in the house is great because it helps us use each other as a sounding board for work-related suggestions or resolution of work issues,” he adds.While it has brought many couples closer than ever, the WFH culture has not been kind to a few. For business manager, Balaji, who left for his wife’s native village in Tamil Nadu a few days before lockdown, network issues are playing spoilsport. “My day starts at 9am and ends by 1am,” he says. His wife, Thabhu, who manages a sales team in Chennai, adds with a laugh, “Since my husband sleeps and wakes up with his mobile phone, I have to WhatsApp him — even though we live together.”",life-style,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-75926514,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-448628/75926514.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//life-style/relationships/work/home-buds-or-work-buds-how-wfh-culture-rewrites-work-ethics-among-couples/articleshow/75926514.cms
3,['24/05/2020'],Will faceprint masks be the new fashion trend?,"Face-printed masks apart, Anto also customises motifs of cartoon and pop-culture icons on masks, on demand.

Anto, who runs a photo studio in Pallavaram, was feeling disheartened that footfalls in his studio began dwindling when his store re-opened to the public, last week. “Even a few regulars who came to click their photos were in masks and could not be recognised. They could also not recognise us. This is when I thought why not make a mask that looked real and interesting at the same time,” he adds.

Anto then made a prototype by making a mask out of banyan material stitched with cotton material, by superimposing the picture of a person wearing it, from the nose down.

“I made a few sample masks for my staff, according to the government norms for homemade masks. I encouraged my staff to wear these masks, even though they thought it was comical. And around a week back, I made a video and circulated it among photographer communities to boost their morale. Most of them were feeling down as they were out of work,” he says. The video soon became viral, and inquiries for the mask — priced between `250 and `150 — began piling in, the photographer says.

“Photographers from across cities have now started imbibing this model. I realised that this was a nice way to encourage people to come and get their photos clicked too, following precaution,” he says.

Face-printed masks apart, Anto also customises motifs of cartoon and pop-culture icons on masks, on demand. “A customer recently asked for a mask with the print of Avengers for his 10-year-old son. The idea is to make safety and social distancing interesting, while encouraging the work of photographers,” Anto explains.

6,['24/05/2020'],UP: Ancient idol of Lord Vishnu recovered in Kaushambi village,"The district authorities said they would speak about more about the idol after consulting with archaeologists.

PRAYAGRAJ: An ancient idol of Lord Vishnu has been recovered at the village of Rasoolpur Badagav under the limits of Manjhanpur tehsil in Kaushambi district here on Saturday. The idol was recovered during the digging work of Khumbhi pond under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Gurantee Act ( MNREGA ) work.

District magistrate (Kaushambi) Manish Kumar Verma told TOI, “We have apprised the authorities of ASI (Archaeological Survey of India) about the recovery of the ancient idol of Lord Vishnu, who assume that the idol might be from 12th century. The authorities of Allahabad Museum have also been apprised of the discovery who would also be sending a team of experts to study the recovered idol.""

The idol is currently in possession of treasury department and teams of ASI and Allahabad Museum would be examining it on Sunday.

SDM (Manjhanpur) Rajesh Chandra, meanwhile, said that the ancient old idol was recovered when around 150 labourers were digging Khumbhi pond in Rasoolpur Badagav development block under MANREGA scheme and when a labourer named as Sukhraj suspected the presence of idol. As soon as the labourers spotted the idol, they informed the village head and block development officer about the recovery.

Upon being alerted, district authorities immediately rushed to the spot and took the ancient idol in their possession. Officials said they had already consulted the ASI authorities to know more about the status of recovered idol.

According to villagers, this idol has four arms of Lord Vishnu carrying a conch, gada and chakra . The district authorities said they would speak about more about the idol after consulting with archaeologists. Leaders and workers of Hindu frontal organisation also assembled to get a glimpse of the recovered idol and demanded district authorities to install it at a temple for prayers.

CHANDIGARH: In a significant development in the liquor theft scam of Sonipat , the special investigation team (SIT) on Saturday arrested an assistant sub inspector (ASI), who had been the close confidant of sacked inspector Jasbir Singh .

Jaipal, who is in his early 40s, was arrested from a residential colony in Rohtak . The Sonipat court has ordered his police remand. Meanwhile, the SIT sleuths have started conducting raids across the state and New Delhi to track down Jasbir, co-mastermind of the scam.

""We are hopeful of getting important clues from Jaipal. He had been a close aide of Jasbir Singh and had been the investigating officer in cases against Bhupinder Singh, kingpin of the entire racket. He and Jasbir had even threatened the officials of the Sonipat police, who wanted to give evidence in the case. Jaipal is being interrogated,'' said Sonipat SP Jashandeep Singh Randhawa.

Interestingly, the interrogation of Bhupinder SIngh and his associate Satish Kumar has spilled the beans and their relations with politicians in Punjab and Haryana . During interrogation, Bhupinder has confessed to his the relationship with influential politicians of both states.

""During lockddown, he managed to forge permits of essential supplies, allegedly bearing the stamp of executive magistrate, Derabassi. During verification, the permits were found to be fake. He then confessed to have picked stock of liquor from Rajpura and Derabassi for supply in Haryana and other dry states. We have been able to establish his link with with a bootlegger in Gujarat,'' said Randhawa.

The SP, however, maintained that as of now, no proof of Bhupinder's direct or indirect link with any politician from Punjab had come on records.

WASHINGTON: A US Navy warship has successfully tested a new high-energy laser weapon that can destroy aircraft mid-flight, the Navy's Pacific Fleet has announced.

Images and videos provided by the Navy show the amphibious transport dock ship USS Portland executing ""the first system-level implementation of a high-energy class solid-state laser"" to disable an aerial drone aircraft, the Navy said in a statement on Friday.

It did not give a specific location of the laser weapons system demonstrator (LWSD) test, saying only that it occurred in the Pacific on May 16.

Navy ships face an increasing number of threats in conducting their missions, including Unmanned Aerial Vehicles, armed small boats , and adversary intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance systems.

The US Navy has been developing directed-energy weapons (DEWs), to include lasers, since the 1960s.

DEWs are defined as electromagnetic systems capable of converting chemical or electrical energy to radiated energy and focusing it on a target, resulting in physical damage that degrades, neutralises, defeats, or destroys an adversarial capability, the statement said.

The Navy's development of DEWs like the LWSD, provide immediate warfighter benefits and provide the commander increased decision space and response options.

""By conducting advanced at sea tests against UAVs and small crafts, we will gain valuable information on the capabilities of the Solid State Laser Weapons System Demonstrator against potential threats,"" Captain Karrey Sanders , commanding officer of Portland, said in the statement.

""With this new advanced capability, we are redefining war at sea for the Navy.""

The Navy says lasers, which it calls directed energy weapons (DEW), can be effective defences against drones or armed small boats.

10,['24/05/2020'],4 crore migrant workers in India; 75 lakh return home so far: MHA,"NEW DELHI: The Centre on Saturday said around four crore migrant labourers are engaged in various works in different parts of the country and so far 75 lakh of them have returned home in trains and buses since the nationwide lockdown was imposed.

Joint Secretary in the Union Home Ministry , Punya Salila Srivastava , said the railways have engaged over 2,600 'Shramik' special trains since May 1 for transportation of the migrant workers from different parts of the country to their destinations.

""According to the last census report, there are four crore migrant workers in the country,"" she said at a press conference here.

Elaborating on the steps taken by the central government for the convenience of migrant workers since March 25, when the nationwide lockdown began, Srivastava said 35 lakh migrant workers have reached their destinations using 'Shramik' special trains, while 40 lakh have travelled in buses to reach their destinations.

The joint secretary said that on March 27, the Home Ministry had sent an advisory to all states and Union Territories (UTs) that the issue of migrant workers should be handled with sensitivity and ensure that they don't move during the lockdown.

The states and UTs were also told to provide them food and shelter, she said.

On March 28, the Home Ministry issued an order empowering the states and UTs to use funds under the National Disaster Response Fund ( NDRF ) for providing food and shelter to the migrant workers.

By April 3, a total of Rs 11,092 crore have been released by the central government to the states and UTs under the NDRF, Srivastava said.

She said the Home Ministry has also set up a 24x7 control room to monitor migrant workers' issues across the country under the supervision of the joint secretary level officers. States and UTs were also told to set up similar control room, she said.

The joint secretary said the Home Ministry again sent an advisory on March 29 asking the states to provide food and shelter to the migrant workers.

The states were also told to make wide publicity so that the migrant workers know the facilities available for them.

Subsequently, another advisory was sent banning transportation of migrant workers by trucks and made the SPs responsible for any violation.

Srivastava said the Home Ministry on April 19 allowed movement of workers within a state and on May 1, inter-state movement through trains.

12,['24/05/2020'],No one can predict where oil prices will stabilise: Dharmendra Pradhan,"Petroleum and steel minister Dharmendra Pradhan has spent the lockdown period trying to ensure that oil companies can take advantage of the low crude oil prices, while making cooking gas and subsidy available to Ujjwala scheme beneficiaries. In an interview, Pradhan tells Sanjay Dutta & Sidhartha that Indian steel producers have ramped up exports during the period. Excerpts:

Q: How has the lockdown affected petroleum and steel sectors?

A: Lockdown is a global issue. It was needed to break the chain and there was consensus on it. Globally, the demand for oil products came down significantly. In April, nearly 70% of the demand went away. By May, 60-65% of the demand has been regained. With trains and civil aviation traffic returning, demand will improve. By June, we expect demand to be back at pre-lockdown levels. Also, before the lockdown, three large oil producers were trying to capture the oil market, which resulted in a glut. Coupled with low demand, prices crashed, which no one anticipated. While prices have started rising due to improved demand, no one can predict where prices will stabilize. The uncertainty in the oil market will remain for some time. In steel too, industrial and construction activity had come to a stop. India has managed to use its natural advantage of manpower and raw material and step up exports during this period.

Q: Despite a fall in global crude prices, retail prices remain high as the government has raised taxes…

A: Pump prices correspond to crude price at $65 a barrel and does not put the burden (of hike in Central taxes) on consumers. Consumer prices have remained unchanged. There is an abnormal situation in the oil market when WTI (US benchmark crude) crashed below zero. In these times, it is pointless to revise prices, especially when demand is gone. What do you do when things are bad? You tighten the purse strings, focus on bare essentials. This is what all of us have seen our mothers do. This (tax hike) is the same. India has consciously adopted this fiscal model. We need resources for the poor, healthcare, to provide stimulus and build infrastructure. That is what the money will be used for.

Q: Due to movement of migrants, do you see labour problem in executing projects?

A: Historically, eastern India has lagged in development. Since the Modi government came to power, it has been trying to correct this imbalance by pushing for a second Green Revolution with focus on the East, announced several large projects and major schemes also focused on benefiting people from this part of the country. Migration is not just an economic issue but a socio-psychological issue. It’s (currently) a reverse migration due to a health issue. Some people will return, others will look for new avenues. The projects announced in the East will create employment opportunities.

Q: The package that has been announced for MSME, how many units in the steel sector will benefit? How will it spur demand?

A: It’s not just about MSMEs but a comprehensive package that addresses major issues in agriculture. There is special emphasis on housing which will benefit cement, steel, logistics, local industry and provide jobs. Every country has adopted different strategies, we have chosen this path. We are ahead of many countries on direct benefit transfer, which we have successfully used for transfering funds to the poor, including Ujjwala beneficiaries. It wasn’t a stimulus but a genuine money transfer.

Q: An important statement from the government is to enhance the role of the private sector. There are several oil and steel PSUs, what will be the strategy?

A: It is a much-delayed and much-awaited decision which is consistent with our philosophy. It does not mean the closure of PSUs. There is unanimity on getting more capital and technology. This should have been done within two years of Independence. People want more job opportunities. The government should be a facilitator in getting investment. It should get more revenue which should be used for social welfare. The idea of the policies is to encourage value addition. We have opened the petroleum sector since 1990s, in steel private players are producing more steel than the public sector.

Q: What about BPCL disinvestment?

A: An in-principle decision has been taken. It depends on the market.

Q: With oil prices falling, does the economics for electric vehicles change?

A: There is no fundamental change. Electric vehicles were expected to contribute to the incremental requirement and not replace internal combustion engines. Naturally, people will use what is available. Price will be a factor and BS-6 fuel and vehicles are now available. The impact will be more in the three- and two-wheelers segments.

13,['24/05/2020'],Pradhan sees fuel demand reaching pre-Corona level next month as India gets back to work,"NEW DELHI: India has regained 65% of its appetite for fuel and demand will reach nearly pre-pandemic levels next month as economic activities pick up pace after the government’s announcement of a stimulus package and staggered easing of Corona restrictions, oil minister Dharmendra Pradhan told TOI on Saturday.

“The world has seen an unprecedented erosion in fuel demand. Many countries saw refineries being shut down, plans being rescheduled. India has fared better in comparison. After the lockdown began (from March 25), fuel demand had dropped to 30-35% of the level seen in April 2019. Yet, major production capacities remained operational. Demand is back at 65% of the May 2019 level and will reach pre-Corona level in June,” Pradhan said.

This compares well with fuel consumption in China, the world’s second-largest oil consumer and the pandemic's epicentre, reaching 90% of the pre-Corona level after losing 40% of the demand in February, as per an IHS Markit report.

A rebound in fuel demand indicates India is getting back to work and the world’s third-largest energy market is poised to regain its position as the global demand centre. “The pattern (the pace of consumption growth) may change. Two-wheelers will be back as an affordable option to maintain social distance and safety while commuting. Same with small cars. This will give impetus to petrol. Rising highway traffic, resumption of train service and farm sector activities fill push diesel sales. Aviation fuel will get a boost once flights resume from May 25,” he said.

Latest industry data show petrol sales rising 7.5% and diesel sales jumping 72% in May following the government’s move to ease lockdown curbs to allow from April 20. Jet fuel sales grew 6-7% and LPG 4% during this period as only select cargo and repatriation flights took to the skies and domestic cooking fuel demand tapered off after the initial panic-buying triggered by the lockdown and commercial consumption was yet to return.

Asked about current pump prices corresponding to $100 oil price and consumers not getting the benefit of historically low oil prices because of the government raising fuel taxes by Rs 13 and Rs 16 a litre of petrol and diesel, respectively, Pradhan said it did not put the burden on consumers and will raise resources for welfare schemes, stimulus package and infrastructure.

“Pump prices have remained steady since they were last changed reduced when was $65/barrel. So it is wrong to say pump prices reflect oil at $100. It is pointless at such times to revise prices, especially when demand is gone. What do you do when things are bad. You tighten the purse strings. Focus on bare essentials. This is what all of us have seen our mother do. This (tax hike) is the same. Where will the money come from? We have to look after the poor, stimulate the economy. Build infrastructure. That is what the money will be used for.”

17,['24/05/2020'],Wholesale veggie prices crash during lockdown,"In the two months since the country went into lockdown, vegetable prices have crashed in wholesale markets across states. The only exception is the potato, which at just under Rs 20 a kg on average, is almost double what it sold for in May last year.TOI looked at wholesale prices of the 15 most common veggies across 19 states and found that prices of all of them, barring potatoes and lemons, had fallen in almost all the states. To discount for seasonal variations, TOI also compared prices with last May, and found the fall to be even sharper (even lemons were way more expensive in May 2019).With state borders sealed, and supply chains hampered, what possibly led to the crashing prices was distress sale of perishable veggies and a sharp drop in demand.""Disruption of supply chain during the lockdown is among the major reason of this collapse in prices,"" said Ashok Gulati, chair professor for agriculture at ICRIER, a policy think-tank. ""If we take onions, the lockdown coincided with the rabi harvest season. That crop could not be transported at that time and is now reaching the market. This has led to the crash in prices,"" he added.Raj Kumar Bhatia, general secretary of the Chamber of Azadpur Fruit & Vegetable Traders (Delhi's biggest mandi), said, ""Our supplies were largely intact but some northern states like Punjab and Himachal Pradesh enforced a strict lockdown. Azadpur mandi is their biggest supplier. And our vehicles could not cross over. So, there were incidents of distress sale.""Bhatia added that the situation could have been better had there been clearer guidelines for local vendors who procure from Azadpur Mandi and supply to Delhi's local markets.Officials from APMCs (Agriculture Produce Market Committees) in the southern states, however, said their supply chains were not disrupted and the crash was probably because of a sudden drop in demand from bulk buyers like restaurants and hotels.Also, the fact that several events like wedding feasts were put off led to a lower demand. The steep fall in wholesale prices, however, hasn't translated into a proportional fall in retail prices, which vary significantly across markets and outlets.So, farmers' income has fallen while consumers haven't benefited fully. It's the middlemen who have raised their margin.The average wholesale price of bhindi, or ladies' finger, (calculated by the government's Agmarknet portal that tracks agricultural marketing) was Rs 3.9 per kg in Chhattisgarh, down 84.6% from March 2020 and 57.3% lower than last May. While Chhattisgarh saw the sharpest drop, prices fell the least in Kerala and Karnataka.Prices of karela (bitter gourd), too, fell in all states, the sharpest - 60% - in Punjab and Haryana. It was the same story for bottle gourd, whose prices crashed everywhere except Kerala and Karnataka.The pricey capsicum was also humbled, selling at Rs 4.4 a kg in Punjab, down over 77%.Garlic prices have also fallen in all states; so have green chillies, which went into a free fall in most states. Onion prices have fallen in all states while tomato is also being sold at lower prices in most of the major states.Prices of brinjal, cabbage, ginger, cucumber and cauliflower showed mixed trends - falling in some states while rising in others.",india,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-75927893,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-164650,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/wholesale-veggie-prices-crash-during-lockdown/articleshow/75927840.cms

(Inputs by Prem Punetha)

NAINITAL: The strain in Indo-Nepal ties has sparked concerns among people on both sides of the porous border who have enjoyed free movement for years, resulting in a tight-knit community where cultural experiences are shared and marriages and trade across the border are common. Families on Uttarakhand-Nepal border that TOI spoke to said they were worried that escalating tensions could affect their “roti-beti” (trade-marriage) contracts that had remained intact for centuries.Ties between the two countries soured after Nepal released a political map showing Kalapani -- a trijunction of India, Nepal and China -- and Lipulekh and Limpiyadhura in Uttarakhand as part of its territory.“For years, we have looked at those across the border as our own. We share the same culture, values, even our struggles are similar. Cross-border marriages are common. At least 60 families out of 250 in our village are related to those living in villages on the other side by marriage,” said Harish Chandra Haisiyat, a resident of Sailani Goth village in Champawat district.Haisiyat’s mother Radha Devi is from Nepal. “She married my father and moved here in 1954. We visit her paternal house every month. Through the years, three of her sisters have married into families in Vadodara, Bareilly and Pithoragarh.”Three districts of Uttarakhand — Champawat, Pithoragarh and US Nagar — share a border with Nepal.Haisiyat added, “There is now this fear that if tensions continue, free movement might be curbed. Right now we don’t need a passport to see our families in Nepal, many of us don’t even have one.”In Pithoragarh’s Majirkanda village, two dozen families share marital ties with those in Nepal. Ganesh Chandra Bhatt, a resident who has in-laws in Nepal, said one only needs a valid government-issued identity card to cross the border.Across, Lal Bahadur Chand from Nepal's Mahendranagar told TOI, “My younger sister lives in Lucknow and we visit each other once every few months. But there is growing tension between the countries and it may have a long-lasting impact.”Historians said the two countries have shared ties deeper than their neighbours in the region. “India and Nepal have an intertwined history. The warrior Gurkhas from Nepal ruled Kumaon division of Uttarakhand from 1790 to 1815. Some royal descendants of the Shah Kings are today settled in Bhimtal,” said historian Ajay Singh Rawat, whose father D S Rawat acted as local guardian for four-time Nepal Prime Minister Lokendra Bahadur Chand when he was studying in Nainital.Defence experts like Maroof Raza said that given the deep bonding and relationships among border villages on both sides in the region, chances of restrictions being imposed along the border were slim. “For hundreds of years Nepal has been a natural partner for India, but growing Chinese influence in Nepal has the potential to hurt the latter’s ties with India.”",india,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-75925032,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-81994,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/roti-beti-ties-intact-for-centuries-shouldnt-be-hit-families-on-indo-nepal-border-at-lipulekh/articleshow/75924964.cms

NEW DELHI: The government is pushing public sector banks to provide additional working capital to small businesses at 7.5% interest under the loan guarantee scheme that proposes to provide up to Rs 3 lakh crore, while also asking them to ensure that senior citizens earn higher returns on their fixed deposits.While paring deposit rates-to ensure that all borrowers benefit from the lower rate regime-bankers have been asked to ensure widespread implementation of the Pradhan Mantri Vaya Vandana Yojana , which has been extended by three years up to March 2023. Under the scheme, senior citizens will be paid 7.4% interest during the current financial year with the rate to be reset next year.Read our coronavirus live blog for all the latest news and updatesWith the Reserve Bank of India repeatedly reducing rates, the State Bank of India has reduced its peak fixed deposit rate to 5.7% for funds parked for 5-10 years. In case of senior citizens, the bank is paying 6.5% a year.The message was conveyed to the bank chiefs during a meeting convened by finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Friday with implementation of the Covid package being the key focus to ensure that cash-strapped small businesses can access funds, and at lower cost.Coronavirus outbreak: Complete coverageCurrently, small businesses are borrowing at 11-12% from state-run lenders.Last week, the government had cleared an emergency facility for business enterprises with a turnover of up to Rs 100 crore and outstanding loans of up to Rs 25 crore.Such businesses will get additional 20% working capital through a government guarantee with interest rate capped at 9.25%. Sitharaman has asked bankers to go all out to ensure that all eligible borrowers benefit from it.Banking sources told TOI that lenders were told that they should also slash lending rates to ensure that the benefits of a reduction in the RBI's key policy rates are passed on to borrowers. On Friday, the RBI had reduced repo rate - or the overnight rate at which it lends to banks - by another 40 basis points. This will mean that state-run lenders will be lowering rates on all loans in the coming months as they adjust their deposit rates.""Basically, the government wants public sector banks to lend at 7.5% although it may not be possible for all of them. But they will try and work out the rates in a way that they can lend around the indicative rate,"" a banking source said.The finance ministry is also asking RBI to assign zero risk weight to additional working capital to small businesses as the loans will be guaranteed by government-owned National Credit Guarantee Trustee Company. ""Since 75% of the claims raised by banks in case a loan turns NPA will be settled by the company, the credit risk is very low and the benefit of lower cost can be passed on to borrowers,"" a government official said.A retired banker said it is in the interest of banks to ensure funding to these businesses so that they can stay afloat.",business,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-75929023,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-77269,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/govt-pushes-psu-banks-to-provide-cheaper-loans-to-small-businesses/articleshow/75929018.cms

PITHORAGARH: Amid the escalating India-Nepal border tension, the Nepalese government has restarted work on the 130-km-long Darchula-Tinkar road project in Darchula district.

According to sources, the road project was sanctioned in 2008 to facilitate Nepal-China border trade through Tinkar Pass. Around 50 km of the road for this project runs parallel with the Indian border along Uttarakhand. The sources confirmed the project has now been taken up again and the Nepal government has decided its Army would complete the remaining portion of the road.

It was presumed that the road project will promote not just trade but also pilgrim and tourist traffic in the area. However, almost 12 years on, only 43-km of the road has been laid due to the tough terrain and harsh weather conditions. With continuous monetary losses, the contractor had also left the job, said the source.

The restarting of the project assumes significance in the wake of protests after Union defence minister Rajnath Singh inaugurated a 80-km road connecting Lipulekh Pass to Dharchula in Uttarakhand on May 8 . However, protests errupted in Nepal just days after as the country claimed that the Pass is apart of its territory.

Meanwhile, a source told TOI that the official reason behind restarting the road project is to enable movement of people of Tinkar and Chhangru which are migratory villages. In order to finish the remaining 87-km track, the source said, the Army is in the process of setting up a base camp at Ghatiabaghar.

26,['24/05/2020'],Puri: Hope to resume international flights before Aug,"NEW DELHI: India will try to restart scheduled international flights before August, depending on the pandemic situation here and in different countries, civil aviation minister Hardeep Singh Puri said on Saturday.

And the minimal contact way of flying means the international travel experience will change, with e-boarding cards soon to be allowed and immigration looking at e-options instead of physically stamping passports.

""I am fully hopeful that before August or September, we will try to start a good percentage of international civil aviation if not complete international operations,"" Puri said during a Facebook Live session on Saturday.

Lufthansa and Swiss have put Mumbai on their list of long-haul destinations from Frankfurt and Zurich, respectively, in June - subject to regulatory approvals from India.

Puri had told TOI on Friday that the ministry was considering allowing e-boarding for international flights very soon. Immigration is also looking at adopting e-practices. ""The future (for Indian airlines) is in wide-body operations. The pandemic will lead to a marked preference among people for direct flights between India and Europe, North America, Australia and other places, instead of transiting through some hub as that will mean going through the entire process of alighting, security checks and boarding again,"" he said.

28,['24/05/2020'],Families of 22 victims to hold prayer meet today,"Posters of children who died in the fire tragedy last year put up outside Takshashila Arcade on Saturday

Surat: Sunday will mark the first anniversary of the macabre Takshashila Arcade fire which had snuffed out lives of 22, majority of them students of the coaching class there.

The scenes of teens jumping down from the building to escape the blaze and dying on May 24, 2019 still send shiver up the spine of those who witnessed the tragedy.

On Saturday, posters with photos of the victims along with stinging questions about ‘shoddy’ investigation were put up by parents of the deceased children. Parents and relatives will hold a prayer meeting at the spot on Sunday. They will light lamps in the night at their homes to pay homage to the deceased.

The fire that started due to electricity overload and spark in an outer unit of air conditioner and spread up to top floor of the building through a plastic hoarding. Entry area of architecture training institute Smart Design studio where the students were studying first caught fire. That did not leave any space for those inside to escape. Panicked students then started jumping on ground one by one from the illegally constructed fourth floor, while many died due to fire and smoke inside.

Police investigation revealed that the entire floor was illegally constructed by developers and Surat Municipal Corporation (SMC) officials had conveniently turned a blind eye to the dangerous structure.

""We are not satisfied with the investigation and we strongly believe that it has been done shoddily under government pressure. Action was taken against junior officers only while their seniors have been protected,"" said an angry parent.

So far, police have arrested 14 persons. Among those arrested are Jignesh alias Jignal Paghdar, the building administrator, Savji Paghdar, Harsukh Vekariya, Dinesh Vekariya and Ravindra Kahar, all three owners of building, coaching class owner Bhargav Butani, SMC executive engineers Parag Munshi and Jayesh Solanki, who had cleared the the project's file, deputy engineers - Vinu Parmar and Himanshu Gajjar, junior engineer Atul Gorsawala, deputy chief fire officer Sanjay Acharya and fire officer Kirti Modh. Dipak Naik, deputy engineer of Dakshin Gujarat Vij Company Limited (GDVCL), was also arrested for negligence.

The offence was registered under various sections of IPC for causing death due to negligence and others. Later, police added sections for forging papers against the accused after getting evidences.

Of the accused Acharya, Modh, Naik and Jignal got regular bail while the court refused relief to other accused. Another accused, Gajjar is also out on temporary bail for treatment. Acharya was arrested by ACB for the case of disproportionate assets registered against him. Acharya later got bail in ACB case as well. Acharya and Modh, who were suspended then have been taken back on job by SMC due to crisis owing to coronavirus.

29,['24/05/2020'],Bihar: Quarantine only for migrants from 11 cities,"Picture used for representational purpose only

PATNA: The state government has tweaked the quarantine protocol for migrants to specify that only those coming from 11 high-risk cities — Surat, Ahmadebad, Mumbai, Pune, Delhi, Ghaziabad, Faridabad, Gurugram, Noida, Kolkata and Bengaluru — will be kept at the block quarantine centres. For others, the district magistrate concerned will take the call.

Chief secretary Deepak Kumar told TOI on Saturday that these 11 cities have been kept in ‘A’ category and all migrant workers coming from there will have to be put in mandatory institutional quarantine. “For those coming from other cities, the DMs will decide whether to put them in institutional quarantine or allow them home quarantine. It will also depend on availability of space at the facilities,” the chief secretary said.

He added, “Taking into account large number of positive cases from ‘A’ category cities, it has been instructed that to maintain social distancing at the quarantine centres, not more than two persons in a room or four persons in a hall be allowed.”

Kumar clarified that those coming on flights, or their own vehicles or on purchased rail tickets will be allowed home quarantine.

A letter in this regard was also issued by the disaster management department principal secretary, Pratyaya Amrit, to all DMs, SSP’s and SP’s on Friday. The letter states that only migrants coming from ‘A’ category cities be put in 14-day quarantine at the block-level centres. Only after the block level facilities get filled, they will be kept to panchayat quarantines. And after completing the mandatory quarantine period, they will be allowed to go home if they are not symptomatic and remain under home quarantine for another seven days.

The letter also directed that migrant workers from ‘B’ category cities be allowed to go under home quarantine if they are asymptomatic. Such migrants will also have to submit a self-attested affidavit promising they will follow the quarantine norms at home.

Earlier, Gujarat, Maharashtra and Delhi with maximum positive cases of migrants were put in ‘A’ category and those coming from these places had to be put in block level quarantine centres. West Bengal, Uttar Pradesh, Haryana and Tamil Nadu were in ‘B’ category and migrants coming from these places could be kept at block or panchayat-level quarantine centres. Those coming from the rest of the states were in ‘C’ category and could be allowed to stay in village quarantine.

A district magistrate said those who are already in quarantine centres even with travel history from ‘B’ category cites will continue to stay there and the new norm will be applied only on those who enter Bihar now.

31,['24/05/2020'],Patna: ‘Shun fear as air travel is quite safe’,"Patna airport director Bhupesh C H Negi

PATNA: Patna airport director Bhupesh C H Negi talks about resumption of domestic flight operations from May 25 and preventive measures being taken to ensure safety of flyers. Excerpts:

Will there be takers for air travel under the present circumstances?

It is too early to comment on passengers’ response. The number of flights has already been reduced to one-third of what the Patna airport used to handle before the lockdown. Altogether 19 flights will operate from Patna airport from May 25, as per the provisional schedule released by the Directorate General of Civil Aviation.

Are preventive steps being taken for the safety of flyers?

We will follow the standard operating procedure (SOP) issued by the Airports Authority of India as well as our internal SOP. There is also the guideline of the ministry of home affairs that we will follow. We will try to ensure minimum touch and exposure between passengers and airport personnel. All the staff of the airport, airlines, CISF and housekeeping will wear protective gears. The housekeeping staff will work round-the-clock to sanitise all touch points.

Will there be an isolation facility at the airport with deployment of Covid-dedicated medical staff?

We have created a separate room at the terminal building for symptomatic passengers. If any person shows symptoms of Covid-19, s/he will be isolated in this room by the medical staff. The doctors will then take the person to the dedicated Covid-19 health facility in the city.

Since the present terminal building is quite small, will it be possible to ensure social distancing?

It will be a challenge for us. We have already conducted a meeting with all the stakeholders to ensure zero contact with passengers, hygiene and sanitisation. Yellow markings have been made to ensure that passengers maintain social distancing.

What is the work plan for AAI and airlines staff?

The duty of all the stakeholders is defined. As per the SOP, the airlines need to ensure that sufficient staff is deployed near check-in counters and pre-security area to guide passengers. Airport operators must make appropriate arrangements for sanitisation of passengers’ baggage before entry into terminal building. Employees showing symptoms will not be allowed to work.

What about modes of transportation, like taxis and autorickshaws, for flyers to go to their respective destinations from the airport?

Three-wheelers can enter the airport premises. Taxis, autorickshaws and e-rickshaws will be allowed to carry only two passengers.

What is your message for flyers?

Air travel is the safest mode of transportation. We have taken all preventive measures for the safety of the flyers.

PATNA: Police recovered the bodies of a couple, who allegedly committed suicide by hanging themselves from a tree in a litchi orchard at Chhegan Neura village under the Minapur police station area in Muzaffarpur district, on Saturday morning.

“The locals, who had spotted the bodies hanging from the tree, informed us about the incident around 6.30am. Denial of permission for marriage by the family members of the couple, who belonged to the same village, is suspected to be the reason behind the suicide,” station house officer (SHO) of Minapur police station, Raj Kumar, said and added that the bodies were sent to the Sri Krishna Medical College and Hospital for autopsy.

Preliminary investigation suggested that the girl’s wedding was to be solemnized with someone else in April, but was deferred due to the Covid-19 pandemic and rescheduled in June. Meanwhile, the youth, whose body was found on Saturday, used to work in Bengaluru and had returned home during the lockdown. He reportedly pressurised her for marriage, which she denied, but they remained in constant touch with each other over the phone.

A senior police officer monitoring the investigation told this newspaper, “Some locals made an attempt to relate the incident with honour killing, but there is no evidence to prove it.”

Earlier, police quizzed the youth’s father to ascertain the truth behind the incident. He told the interrogators that his son had returned home during the lockdown.

There’s no doubt that tourism sector is extremely important for the economy of the state,” he said.Sanjay said though Bihar has many archaeological and historical sites, the number of people from the state visiting these sites is not up to the expectation. “For instance, Pawapuri doesn’t receive the kind of attention it deserves. Hence, my focus will be on attracting and encouraging people from the state to visit the historical and religious sites,” he said.Even as certain relaxations have been given to several sectors, the tourism and hospitality sector is still under strict restrictions. Tourism in the state, which has been totally shut ever since the lockdown was imposed on May 24, was already hit by the outbreak of Covid-19 in China in December last year.The major tourist places in Bihar, including Rajgir, Bodh Gaya and Nalanda, where Buddhist pilgrims and tourists from China, Vietnam, Thailand and Hong Kong visit in large numbers, were witnessing a drop in footfall since January.“Even though the tourism sector has been badly hit by the Covid-19 crisis, we need to revive it once the lockdown is lifted,” Sanjay said.Meanwhile, experts in hospitality sector said lockdown has left disastrous effects on the tourism sector in the state, rendering tens of thousands of people jobless.

As the airport will witness eight flight movements towards Mumbai, Delhi and Bengaluru from Monday, the airport authorities are giving finishing touches to new travel protocols in Covid-19 era where social distancing and contactless screening have become buzzwords.

Based on standard operational protocol (SOP) issued by Airports Authority of India (AAI), a mock drill to resume flight movements with new set of rules was held on Friday evening.

Before the nationwide lockdown, the airport used to witness 26 flight movements which have come down to eight. It had last witnessed a commercial flight movement on March 22.

“We have to ensure contact-free operations and also that social distancing is maintained for safety of passengers as well as staffers,” said Vadodara airport director Charan Singh.

To begin with, there will be three counters which flyers will have to pass by before entering the terminal building.

Luggage carried by each person will be sprayed with a disinfectant while flyers will have to apply sanitizer on their hands. At the second counter, airlines will issue a mask and a 100ml sanitizer bottle while the staff will check whether the passengers have downloaded Aarogya Setu App. If not, they will have to submit an undertaking.

“After passengers undergo temperature screening, CISF personnel will carry out contact-free identification through a machine which will scan passengers and match ID cards. The passengers will walk on shoe sanitizer mats before entering the terminal building,” he said.

“Passengers will have to stand in a queue maintaining at least 2 metre distance from each other before reaching kiosks that will dispense boarding passes. The boarding passes which were being stamped earlier by CISF officers have been removed,” he said.

CISF personnel have been provided gloves, masks and PPE kits while a two-foot long connecting rod has been attached to their hand-held metal detectors so that they can frisk passengers from a distance of 2 metres.

In the arrival area too, luggage will be sanitized before it is brought to the baggage belt and temperature of passengers will be measured before they leave the airport premises.

PATNA: Bihar police has released a dedicated WhatsApp number on which complaints can be made against unscrupulous police personnel as well as any kind of criminal activity across the state.

The WhatsApp number (9431602301) issued on the directions of DGP Gupteshwar Pandey is aimed at crime control as well as weeding out of the ‘black sheep’ in uniform. The DGP has assured that the identity of the complainant will not be revealed.

A pilot for the initiative has started in Sitamarhi district where people can send in their complaints via WhatsApp between 10am to 5pm till May 31. However, DGP Pandey has also urged people to post information on police personnel who are doing a good job on the field to boost their morale.

“People sometimes are unable to complain to police officer about anyone, including police personnel, due to various reasons. Often they don’t know whom to approach. Hence this unified number has been launched by the headquarters,” ADG (headquarters) Jitendra Kumar said, adding, people would have to provide evidence in support of their complaint via the WhatsApp number.

“Once a complaint is taken up for inquiry, the complainant may be contacted for more evidence if necessary,” he added.

Kumar further said that the step is aimed towards making the state police more people friendly as well as to weed out ‘black sheep’ in police so that the department could get rid of them.

“A dedicated DG Cell is working on the entire process. Complaints would be monitored by a high ranking officer. Inquiry teams over a complaint would be formed as per its nature and extent,” he said.

46,['24/05/2020'],Women SHGs suffer as industrial units shift to mask making,"Workers at an SHG unit in Navsari’s Samapore village

Surat: Jagruti Patel and 16 other women at the Self Help Group (SHG) in Navsari’s Samapore village were happy with the steady flow of income generated by stitching cotton and khadi masks for a non-government organisations (NGOs) and the retail selling in the village and Navsari town.

However, the humming of their sewing machines has stopped as they have not got any supply order in last 20 days. This is because many of the industrial units in Surat have started stitching masks and are selling it as half the price.

“Each woman in our group would stitch 100 masks, earning Rs 250 per day. But, we have stopped manufacturing masks due to stiff competition from the industrial units in Surat,” said Jagruti, coordinator of the Smart Sakhi Mandal, which has manufactured over 6 lakh masks since April 1.

“Our wholesale rate is Rs 10 per piece, while the other industrial units manufacturing masks on large scale are offering for Rs 5 per piece,” says Jagruti.

She and other women of her self-help group are not the only ones who have stopped manufacturing masks. There are many SHG group facing similar problems with host of small and big industrial units in south Gujarat getting into the masks manufacturing business on a large scale.

Sambhu Sakhi Mandal, an SHG in Chalthan village in Surat’s Palsana taluka, is run by about 45 women. From the very next day of lockdown, the SHG women started stitching masks and in the last one month they have manufactured about 8 lakh masks using cotton and non-woven fabrics and supplied them to the sugar mills and to the NGOs.

Pushpa Mistry, coordinator of the Sambhu Sakhi Mandal told TOI, “About 32,000 masks are lying with us since last fortnight. Buyers want masks for Rs 5 per piece, which is not possible. Our input cost is higher because we sourced cotton and non-woven fabric in limited quantities, while the industrial units purchase it in bulk.”

A Surat-based NGO, Shakti Foundation , working with about 300 women in various SHG groups in Surat and Navsari districts has stopped giving orders for the masks due to stiff competition in the market.

Sonal Rochani, co-founder of Shakti Foundation told TOI, “After the lockdown, our first order of 60,000 masks was from the ONGC. For the SHG women, mask making had become a source of livelihood. Now, these women have stopped stitching masks as the industrial units have started making masks in bulk and are offering it at cheaper rates than the SHG groups.”

Rochani added, “The SHG women bought raw material at much higher rate during lockdown and stitched the masks. Now, markets are open and raw material is available at wholesale price. We have urged the state government to help to such SHG groups.”

Kunnathunadu police said a group of migrant labourers saw a hand sticking out of the pit when they were cleaning the factory premises. An investigation is on to identify the deceased though the state of decomposition was such that the police couldn’t even identify the gender of the deceased during inquest proceedings.

“As of now, we are not sure how much time has passed after the death. It could be weeks or even about a month since the death. An autopsy would be held, after which the experts would be able to ascertain the gender and other details,” said a senior officer.

“With the naked eye no injuries were visible on the body, however, forensic surgeons maybe able to tell us more. We are in the process of collecting CCTV footage from the area as well as forensic evidence,” he said.

Police did not rule out the possibility of murder. “Our initial assumption is that it could be a murder. However, it is too early to say anything conclusive,” the officer added.

Police said that they are looking up man-missing cases from the area to identify the deceased. “If the deceased is someone like a guest labourer who keeps moving from place to place, then identification would become difficult,” said the officer.

Surat: The textile traders of Surat have approached the Gujarat government demanding partial reopening of the markets falling under the red zone. Earlier, the Surat Municipal Corporation (SMC) had denied permission for reopening of the textile markets falling in the red zones.

The Vyapar Pragati Sangh (VPS) and many other textile market associations have urged chief minister Vijay Rupani to allow the markets to open for few hours to facilitate the traders to complete the pending works related to banks, GST and income tax.

Barring about 15 textile markets at Sahara Darwaja and Saroli, about 160 textile markets falling in the red zone of Limbayat and central zone have not been granted permission by the SMC to reopen. The Covid-19 positive cases from these two municipal zones are increasing day-by-day, compounding the worries of the textile traders.

President of VPS, Sanjay Jaganani told TOI, “Since last two months, the markets are shut. The traders should be allowed to partially open the shops for carrying out important works related to accounts, banking, income tax, GST return filing etc.”

Jaganani added, “Majority of the textile markets are located in Limbayat zone, where the Covid-19 cases are on the rise. In this case, we won’t be able to reopen the market for few more months.”

Jay Lal, director of the Federation of Surat Textile Traders Association (FOSTTA) told TOI, “Without textile markets, the MMF (man-made fibre) sector can’t reopen. We will have to learn to live with the virus and can’t sit home without doing business. The government must revise the guidelines for reopening shops in the red zone.”

Devkishan Manghani, chairman of textile committee of Southern Gujarat Chamber of Commerce and Industry (SGCCI) said, “Less than 5% textile shops in the 15 textile markets in Saroli and Sahara Darwaja have reopened. It is because, the textile markets on Ring Road are still closed. The administration need to allow the business activity to resume.”

SURAT: Even as the state government relaxed lockdown guidelines for industrial units to improve economic activity across the state, Surat’s Rs 50 ,000 crore man-made fabric (MMF) industry is still grappling to resume operations. Surat is India’s largest MMF hub catering to 45% of the country’s MMF demand.Faced with the mass exodus of migrant labourers and subdued demand of fabrics, the industry has started with 30,000 powerloom machines, which is 20% of the installed capacity of 6.50 lakh machines.Ashish Gujarati, president of Pandesara weavers association said, “At present less than 10 lakh meters of fabric is weaved every day as against the installed capacity of 4 crore metres. The production will continue till the time the weavers have yarn stock with them.”Industry sources said the powerloom units have resumed operation to safeguard their yarn stock, which was gathering dust in the units for the last 60 days.The MMF textile chain is finding it difficult to resume operation with about 95% of the textile markets shut. About 155 textile markets housing over 55,000 textile shops are located in the red zone and the Surat Municipal Corporation (SMC) has not given permission to the traders to resume operation.“There are a host of challenges faced by the MMF sector. The textile markets are yet to resume, weavers are drained of working capital and they don’t have liquidity to purchase fresh raw material. On the other hand, the demand of MMF fabric is yet to come from the domestic markets,” said Bharat Gandhi, chairman, Federation of Indian Art Silk Weaving Industry (FIASWI).Over 200 powerloom units, out of the total 2,300 units, have restarted in Sachin GIDC and the majority of them are manufacturing viscose fabric for suiting and shirting.Mahendra Ramoliya, chairman of Sachin GIDC notified area told TOI, “Viscose yarn was lying in the godowns for almost two months and the stock has to be utilised before monsoon season before fungus growth. However, the viscose units have started operation, while majority of the powerloom units are yet to start.”Jitendra Vakharia, president, South Gujarat Textile Processors Association (SGTPA) said, “About 40 textile mills will be operational after May 25. The retail stores and wholesale cloth mandis in majority of the states have started operations and we believe the demand may come in the next fortnight, if there is no further lockdown announced by the government.”The South Gujarat Textile Processors Association (SGTPA) has called for abolition of the age-old practice of supplying grey cloth or unfinished fabric from powerloom units to textile markets to stop the spread of coronavirus . Instead, the textile traders are urged to make arrangements for direct delivery of the unfinished fabrics to the textile mills.The smooth operation of the MMF textile chain has been disturbed with about 95% of the textile markets in the red zone yet to restart operation. Textile traders are the key players in the chain and without them the sector can’t think of resuming normal operation.

“I bought a thick mask, thinking it would provide better protection but felt like I would faint in the afternoon when I went out for work,” said T Saravanan of Anna Nagar.

With the temperature soaring, wearing masks is becoming a difficult task for people. “Wearing masks is going to be a big challenge for people in cities like Madurai where it is extremely hot for over eight months in a year. But, they should not be avoided at any cost,” said Dr S Selvarani.

Tender coconut sellers like Ramanathan in Chokkikulam said that he had good sales in the last two days, when he sold more than 50 tender coconuts in a day, compared to April, when he did not even sell 15 tender coconuts.

The roads which were comparatively clean for nearly two months, turned dusty with the increase in number of vehicles and afternoon temperature. Scorching temperatures in summer is not new to Madurai, it is the Covid-19 crisis which has made it challenging, said a few people. “Having a drink to quench your thirst in a public place which is a must or taking shelter in a common place, when it becomes tiring, is a big risk now,” said Kavitha S, a working woman.

Although some of them have reopened recently, the number of patients walking in to the OPD at Karnataka Institute of Medical Sciences (KIMS) has not reduced, say hospital sources.Treating non-Covid patients during this crisis has become a priority for KIMS, hence hospital authorities have asked all its staff including doctors to be present at the OPD and their respective departments from 9am to 4pm every day.However, the authorities have found that several staff members including doctors were not present during duty hours. The fact the KIMS authorities discontinued biometric attendance system after the outbreak of Covid-19, did not help matters. Authorities say some doctors and other staff enter the hospital just before lunch and leave in the afternoon.This issue was discussed during a recent meeting of head of the departments at KIMS. To streamline attendance and ensure the staff remain in the hospital during their duty hours, the chief administrative officer has asked all employees to register with a facial recognition-based system which was installed at the IT room of the hospital.

The villagers used this opportunity to question the officials about the lack of action despite several assurances.

The coastal body’s notice stated that the inspection on Friday pertained to a letter dated May 25, 2019 from local MLA, Alina Saldanha regarding copies of some documents relevant to the project.

But at the site, the issue sought to be taken up was permission sought by the project proponent to repair bunds and sluice gates.

The MLA, sarpanch Maria D’Souza, deputy sarpanch Sebastiao Serrao and biodiversity management committee chairman Lopinho Xavier questioned the officials about the lack of action despite several inspections.

Others pointed out that a report of a site inspection on July 21, 2019 had recommended action against various illegalities in khazan land, which is a no-development zone.

GCZMA officials said they would conduct a survey of khazan land and compare with the old plans and initiate action for restoration of reclaimed land.

Though the water division had announced a shutdown for two days — Friday and Saturday — work was completed on Friday itself and low-lying areas received water by midnight.

Supply was restored to other areas by Saturday, PWD executive engineer Nivruti Parsekar, said.

The WTP had to be shut down as major work was to be taken up at the 33kV electrical substation that powers the plants at the Opa Water Works complex.

“Work that was taken up on Friday included overhauling of 33kV sub-station instruments, cleaning electrical insulators, checking and rectifying cable panel equipment and other allied tasks such as greasing, checking and tightening of cable connections,” Parsekar said.

Opa Water Works treats 160MLD of water that is supplied to almost 95% of the Ponda and Tiswadi talukas and parts of Dharbandora. The state capital of Panaji, defence establishments, and the Goa Medical College and hospital also fall under its ambit.

77,['24/05/2020'],Tamil Nadu: Beauty parlours to open on Sunday sans AC,"MADURAI: While the beauty parlours are set to reopen on Sunday, after being closed for nearly 50 days, they would have to function without using air conditioner (AC) as directed by the government guidelines. This has left the parlour owners in a spot as they would now have to renovate the premises for better air flow.

President of the professional women beauticians’ welfare association, Kalaiselvi Jaikumar said that the government allowed them open shops from Sunday. “We have informed our members that safety and hygiene would be of utmost importance and they would have to use single-use towels for facials and other services in parlours,” she said.

Kalaiselvi said that about 50% out of their 1,500 odd members in the southern districts including Madurai, Theni and Virudhunagar, have centralized air conditioning in their parlours and they would have to renovate the premises for better airflow as air conditions are strictly not allowed to be used. “Many of them would find it very difficult and the banks should come forward to offer loans without collateral or security. The Madurai district collector T G Vinay has assured us that we can avail the loans easily,” she said.

There are many customers like Lakshmi Priya, who really wants to visit a parlour. “But, I will wait for some time before I go for services that need a longer stay in the parlour as one thing is for sure that there is going to be no more relaxing in parlours, because without air conditioning, it would be difficult,” she said.

Meanwhile, the association has been training their members on better practices. “Facials would be a challenge. We would have to wear a protecting shield, and gloves are a must for all services,” said R Vijayarani a beautician.The government has said that the parlours must keep sanitizing the premises five times a day, wear masks and ensure the health and hygiene of the workers. They would have to ensure that the parlours are clean and neat and clutter-free for additional safety.

78,['24/05/2020'],Civic body resumes work on Bhubaneswar’s sanitation project,"The micro composting centre in Bhubaneswar

BHUBANESWAR: With the movement of labourers allowed in the fourth phase of lockdown, the Bhubaneswar Municipal Corporation (BMC) on Saturday resumed work on the city’s ambitious sanitation project — a micro composting centre (MCC).

The work was stalled for four months owing to the restrictions on the movement of the labourers. The MCC project will ensure that municipal waste generated from the household are processed and converted into compost.

Just before the lockdown, the BMC had decided to engage one swachh sathi per 600 households for conducting a door-to-door campaign and educating people on sanitation and segregation of household waste.

BMC deputy commissioner (sanitation) Subhendu Sahu said they had planned to resume the work in the third phase of the lockdown, but failed as only the labourers available at that site could have worked (according to the guidelines set by the government).

“We did not get labourers as the people working there had left for their villages and they couldn’t be brought back owing to the restrictions. As the fourth phase lockdown was enforced, which allowed the movement of labourers from one place to another, we resumed the MCC work,” Sahu said.

The work on the MCC at the temporary transit station (TTS) near Sainik School —the point of transportation of the solid waste to the designated site at Daruthenga — has been completed. However, the work on the remaining 42 centres is underway.

In the first week of January, the BMC had decided not to dump the bulk of waste at the dump yard at Daruthenga, a village on the outskirts of the city. Instead, it has decided to take the waste to the MCCs. “Had the work on the MCCs been completed, we could have taken a final call on whether to continue to dump waste at Daruthenga,” a BMC official said.

The municipal solid waste will be converted into compost at the proposed 43 MCCs. Since the BMC will take the waste to the MCCs, they need to be segregated at the source. There is no facility for the bulk segregation of waste at the MCCs.

“The MCCs are suitable alternatives for the waste disposal and conversion of bulk waste into compost. The BMC will also save money as they won’t need hundreds of transporting vehicles, which lift waste from different locations and take the load to Daruthenga,” the official added.

PANAJI: As students entered the school premises at Dr KB Hedgewar High School on Saturday morning to answer their Class X public exams, they were showered with petals of marigold flowers. In schools across Goa, over 19,000 students appeared for the exam of the Goa Board of Secondary and Higher Secondary Education , under the unique circumstances on Saturday.

Despite the huge number of students answering the exam, teachers and Goa Board officials ensured smooth conduct of the test on the first day.

In most schools, students were allowed to enter the exam halls an hour before the scheduled exam time. This ensured social distancing was maintained and sanitising students’ hands and thermal screening of their temperature could take place without crowding.

Students were allowed in many places to continue their revision after entering the exam halls.

“The situation had turned tense everywhere so we decided to shower some marigold petals on the students to motivate them and make the atmosphere happy. Our teachers also gave the students ear-support guards so they do not experience discomfort from the prolonged mask use that can cause chafing of the skin behind the ears. The ear-support guard was an innovation at our school’s Atal Tinkering Lab,” said headmaster of Dr KB Hedgewar High School Vilas Satarkar.

Schools in rural areas helped transport students to the exam centres in school buses. Police personnel were also posted in many areas to ensure that parents maintain social distancing outside exam halls. At some exam centres though, it was the parents who were seen crowding together as they waited to pick up their children after the exam. Parents were kept 200m away from exam halls everywhere.

Parents and teachers from primary section of schools were engaged as volunteers at many centres to ensure that students leave and enter the exam halls without crowding.

“It helped that two minor papers of Class X and the remaining papers of Class XII were held first as there were fewer students appearing for those papers. This served as a sort of rehearsal for the main paper for which thousands are appearing,” said a teacher. The next Class X paper, the mathematics exam will be held after a gap of two days, on Tuesday.

80,['24/05/2020'],Chellanam staring at another erosion?,"temporary measure: Filling of geobags under way at Chellanam on Thursday

Kochi: With southwest monsoon expected to hit the state by first week of June, more than 300 families in the coastal hamlet of Chellanam are under the threat of yet another sea erosion as the geotube seawall work, started in 2017, is yet to be completed.

Though the contract was renewed by the state irrigation department and the project was re-inaugurated two weeks back, the work has not begun. Even though V S Sunil Kumar, minister in-charge of Ernakulam, assured that the work would start by May 20, during his visit to Chellanam, nothing except the filling of geobags has started.

Residents said the sea will soon turn rough as monsoon is round the corner and they will have to bear the brunt as most of the seawall along the coast has been washed away in the strong waves over the last three years. The geobags, which are installed on top of the seawall as a temporary solution, could not protect the coast from strong waves and the futility of the bags was proven during the last two monsoons when seawater washed them away and flooded the houses. The Chellanam Janakiyavedi, which has been protesting for the last 200 days, said the authorities should resume the works at the earliest.

“It is the fourth inauguration of Chellanam geotube project since its inception in 2017. Now, the project has been given to a new contractor and they promised to complete the tube installation at two out of the five sites — Velankanni and Chellanam Bazaar — before the monsoon. It won’t take long for the rains to begin, but no work has begun so far. We are worried that this time too the work will be stopped abruptly like the previous ones. If the sea turns rough our houses will be flooded and we will be having sleepless nights again,” said Joseph Arackal, convener of Janakiyavedi.

The worst-affected areas are Companypady and Maruvakkad, where the seawall has crumbled completely. Geobags are currently being installed in these areas but residents are skeptical about its effectiveness. “Geobags are a waste of money and sand as they won’t survive monsoons. The government should complete the geotube works at the earliest. If flooding starts, we won’t be able to move to camps amid the Covid-19 pandemic situation,” Arackal added.

Meanwhile, district collector S Suhas visited Chellanam as part of a food-kit distribution programme. While talking to residents, he assured that work would begin on Friday and completed before the monsoon begins. But if the sea turns rough, which is most likely in the coming weeks, the work cannot be pursued.

HYDERABAD: With no uniform policy applying to them, the odd-even rule has left street vendors in the lurch. With the civic body yet to provide numbers to all vendors, they are either being forced to remain shut or unable to adhere to social distancing norm as there is a complete chaos at these shops.

Pomar Raju, a vendor who sells chunnis at KPHB, says the civic body has asked them to mark their own shops or carts. “The GHMC must give us numbers so that we can work legally. Leaving people to mark shops themselves will lead to problems.”

Already facing the consequences, Srinivas K in Sultan Bazaar, Koti, said, “Without numbers being allotted, the more powerful hawkers, who have leased out spaces or carts, are ruling the roost. They are able to open every day, making it impossible for people like us to survive in an already tough situation.”

Akshay Kumar, an activist, who lives in Ghansi Bazaar in Old City says that chaos has returned to the area. “Hawkers and shops in this area are not following the odd-even rule. There is absolutely no social distancing.”

While insisting that it is the GHMC that must enforce the rule, S Venkatmohan, president of Telangana Street and Hawkers Union, highlighted the other side of the story. He said, “State government has declared that everyone can reopen their shops, but civic body officials are not allowing street vendors to reopen. I have already reported this to GHMC commissioner on Twitter as well as through mails.” Explaining the situation, he said there are 300 hawkers in KPHB service road, 250 members in Dilsukhnagar and approximately 350 members in Sultan Bazaar. “If the permission is not given to the street vendors for their vending they are going to lose their livelihood,” he said.

Vennala Suresh, from Dilsukhanagar, said,“I had a take away amount of Rs 600 a day but have been getting nothing since two months.”

When contacted, V Prashanti, deputy commissioner, Kukatpally, GHMC, said, “We are concerned about the well-being of street vendors. We are awaiting specific instructions about them. In the meantime, I am planning to visit some congested areas in my jurisdiction to see the best way forward.”

QUEPEM: Alleging that mining companies had not kept their promise of stopping movement of iron ore trucks during the SSC exams and stating that students’ safety was at stake, councillor of Quepem Municipal Council (QMC) Manuel Colaco stopped the ore-laden trucks at Quepem on Saturday.

The five-time chairperson stopped the loaded trucks near the cemetery along the Quepem-Cavrem road. QMC chairperson Dayesh Naik and councillor Raul Pereira joined him later. Two SSC examination sub-centres are located at Quepem town., and one at Tilamoll. The trucks were headed to Curchorem, which has four examination sub-centres. “Due to continuous movement of trucks we face a risky and difficult situation in taking our children to the centre at Curchorem,” a parent from Molcornem, Marcus Sequeira said.The Holy Cross Institute, the main centre in Quepem town, is located 40m from the main road and the noise of speeding trucks disturbs the students.

Many parents from Ambaulim and far off places told TOI that the route to the examination centres is unsafe for their children due to the heavy truck movement. “There is also no public transport,” one parent said.

Soon after blocking the trucks at Quepem , Colaco rang deputy collector Rohit Kadam and asked him to issue a written order to the mine owners to stop ore transportation from morning till 2pm, during the SSC exams. Kadam said that he will direct the mines’ representatives to stop the transportation during exams as they agreed by them during the meeting chaired by him on May 12.

87,['24/05/2020'],Everyone must be allowed the test: HC,"Ahmedabad: The Gujarat high court on Saturday, while giving a judgement on the current Covid-19 scenario, observed that everyone must be permitted to have a Covid-19 test done.

The state is in the eye of the storm for capping the per day tests and introducing the clause for private labs requiring permission of the state authorities before conducting any test.

The court stated that all laboratories able to fulfil the prescribed criteria and infrastructure must be granted the permission and must be permitted to conduct RT-PCR tests. The court also suggested that the rates for testing in private labs must have a ceiling cap – currently it is Rs 4,500.

“Everyone must be permitted to have a Covid-19 test done. However, there must be a specific mention of the following categories of persons for whom the Covid-19 test must be mandatory – those who have been hospitalized for Covid-19 and who want to have a test done post discharge from the hospital, family members of those persons who have been tested Covid-19 positive or who have been hospitalized or who have returned after hospitalization or who have died on account of Covid-19, those persons who have a written prescription issued by a doctor,” reads the order.

The bench said that the argument that ‘more number of tests which lead to 70% of the population testing positive for Covid-19, thereby leading to fear psychosis’ should not be a ground to refuse or restrict the testing.

“Wide publicity must be given by the state in the way of newspaper advertisements ...,” the order stated.

88,['24/05/2020'],Buildings to be identified to relocate people,"Kochi: Village officials, tahasildars and secretaries of all local bodies in the district have been asked to identify buildings where people can be rehabilitated in case of heavy rain during the monsoon while following social distancing norms in the backdrop of Covid-19 pandemic.

The decision in this regard was taken at a review meeting held in colletcorate on Thursday.

Officials have to locate four buildings situated in the same compound under each local body limit. One building would be for accommodating people, the second one for vulnerable people, including elderly and children, third for lodging people undergoing home quarantine and the fourth for people with symptoms.

Besides, a committee comprising village officer, ward members and representatives of both male and female from public should be constituted. The committee should convene a meeting with the public on availability of food, prevalence of symptoms, medical care, if needed, and it should be intimated to the village officer and secretaries of local bodies. Village officer would be the in-charge of the camp. A meeting will be convened on May 26 to discuss further about in this regard.

Collector S Suhas said the disaster management plan has been prepared in a decentralized method. A coordination centre will be set up at Kaloor to coordinate the functions related to Covid and monsoon relief activities. Steps have been taken to run rehabilitation camps following all the social distancing norms.

Meanwhile, a geologist has been selected for preparing a plan regarding sand mining in Muvattupuzha river.

Agriculture minister V S Sunilkumar said quarantine facility will be arranged in local level in view of more people reaching the district after restrictions were relaxed. Vacant houses, identified in panchayats and municipalities will be arranged to lodge people coming from other states. Vigilant committees formed in panchayat level should make the arrangements.

Those who do not have facilities to undergo home quarantine will be lodged in these houses in their area.

89,['24/05/2020'],"3 days on, voice-data woes continue; WFH execs in a fix","Kolkata: Three days have passed since cyclone Amphan wreaked havoc in the city and its adjacent districts, almost 70% of the cellphone users and data subscribers of both wired and on-the-air services are running around their houses to receive signals on their devices.

The Cellular Operators’ Association of India (COAI) director-general, Rajan S Mathews, told TOI on Saturday that approximately 30% to 35% of the base transceiver stations (BTS) or mobile towers covering the city have been impacted.

The telecom firms’ umbrella body has also said that all the cellular operators have activated intra-circle roaming (ICR) services but that too proves ineffective, when most of the operators, in the absence of signals, lose coverage in a circle.

Explaining the long absence of signals in Kolkata, the COAI DG said: “Despite repairing numerous fiber cuts, matters exacerbated as cleaning crews, while removing fallen trees and debris, caused more damage to the optical fibres. Also, movement of emergency response teams have been hampered because of fallen electric lines and fears of electrocution.” Work from home ( WFH ) executives in the metropolis, who had been struggling to adjust to the new normal amid the Covid-lockdown, are now failing to tide over the connectivity crisis.

On Friday, many WFH professionals, whose job solely depends on telecom data and voice services, had urged their bosses to allow them to work in office for a couple of days till the Net connection gets restored.

Pradip Chanda, the CEO of Elogix Software at Salt Lake Sector V, told TOI that he received several such calls from his colleagues, but he could not permit the same, breaching the lockdown protocol. Arijit Gupta is at a loss trying to comprehend how to inform his bosses in the UK about his plight. Gupta, who had come to India from Leicester before the lockdown, is looking for ways to send across this month’s sales report, after having already missed his May 21 deadline.

“The intermittent signals on my phone just wouldn’t support a five-minute call,” Gupta, a resident of Garia, said. Shalini Roy, a travel portal employee, wanted to get in touch with her company HQ at Hong Kong since May 21, but she could't even send a mail across.“With the prevailing business condition, I don't even know I still have the job or not,” she said.

Forget international calls, most Kolkatans till Saturday could not even wade through the communication logjam within the city.

Telecom companies, which have wasted no time in selling data and calling packages amid the lockdown, are now finding it difficult to serve subscribers across the city. ""This is quite frustrating that my expenditure on extra data is going down the drain, which neither my office, nor the cellular firms are going to compensate,"" said Santanu Mitra, a software engineer at a Japanese multinational company. Cellular firms, however, have claimed that 95% of services would be restored by Sunday. In a statement, Vodafone Idea said the company is organising fuel supply to our sites using mobile DGs as power outages are disrupting services.

92,['24/05/2020'],Kukke temple retains no. 1 spot with Rs 98.9cr annual revenue,"MANGALURU: The richest Muzrai temple in Karnataka — Kukke Subrahmanya temple — on Friday posted a whopping annual income of Rs 98.9 crore for 2019-20, up by Rs 6 crore over the previous year. The revenue boost comes despite floods in Karnataka during last year’s monsoon season and reduced footfalls in March due to the Covid-19 restrictions.

With Rs 42.5 crore, earnings from sevas , including ‘ sarpasamskara ’ and ‘ sarpadosha ’, topped the income list for the temple situated in Dakshina Kannada district and 280km from Bengaluru.

The balance sheet shows Rs 22 crore as interest earned from banks and Rs 18.2 crore as hundi (donation box) collection. Compared with the previous fiscal, hundi collections went up by Rs 80 lakh and income from sevas jumped by Rs 2 crore.

The temple, which sees several high-profile visitors every year, earned Rs 2.2 crore from rents and contracts, Rs 4.7 crore from mass feeding contributions and Rs 4.8 crore as rent from temple halls.

“The number of devotees visiting the temple decreased after heavy rains and floods in North Karnataka in 2019. As the situation improved, lockdown was announced. Both had effect on temples in Dakshina Kannada,” said Ravindra MH, Kukke temple executive officer.

He said the temple’s revenue dropped to Rs 92 crore in 2018-19 as against Rs 95.9 crore in 2017-18. “The negative growth was due to floods. Roads connecting the district were damaged and closed for months forcing devotees to avoid Kukke temple visit. We expected the same results this year also. But things improved after monsoon,” he added.

Authorities said the temple spent Rs 64.6 crore in 2019-20. Nearly Rs 18 crore was spent for construction and renovation works and the rest includes salary, funds for organizing festivals, expenditure on sevas, education and others.

Senior officials of DFCCIL, a public sector undertaking under ministry of railways, and contracting agencies have written to district magistrates of their respective areas, requesting them to provide available migrant labourers willingly to work in ongoing construction of dedicated freight corridors.

The migrant workers rendered jobless during the coronavirus-triggered lockdown could hence get jobs near their home towns after some basic training.

“Although a large number of workers are already working as various sections o f freight corridors across the country are still under construction, there is no dearth of jobs for labourers. The agency, given contract in each section, would ensure fast-paced training and then hire the labourers for different works as per need,” said DFCCIL Managing Director, A K Sachan, while talking to TOI on Tuesday.

Officials and contractors of both Eastern and Western dedicated freight corridors have already started the process in this regard at Prayagraj and Mirzapur in UP, Sonnagar (Bihar), Ludhiana (Punjab), parts of Maharashtra, Gujarat, Haryana and other states where construction is going on, he added.

“The work at different sites was stopped during first phase of lockdown but was restarted when government announced relaxations in second and subsequent phases. However, going with the mammoth size of work in hand, the agencies that have been allotted work have huge demand for workers and could employ these migrant labourers,” Sachan added.

All the labourers already working in the ongoing projects were retained by contractors and were paid their wages too. The work has been going on during lockdown while following all the protocols and norms laid down to control Covid-19 pandemic, be it social distancing, wearing masks etc, he said.

PRAYAGRAJ: Posting videos spreading awareness about schizophrenia and the need to break the taboo associated with the disease will be among the several activities city hospitals have planned for World Schizophrenia Day, which will observed on Sunday.

The mental health cell of Motilal Nehru Divisional Hospital also will also organise events online on the day. “Usually several events are organised on this day every year with the purpose of spreading awareness about schizophrenia, however, the ongoing lockdown and the Covid-19 pandemic necessitate a different approach . Hence, we would be making people aware about the disease in a different way,” said Dr Ishanya Raj, a clinical psychologist at MLN Divisional Hospital.

“The theme for this year’s events is ‘Stay Connected’. The pandemic has taught us that it is important to stay connected and reach out for support if you are schizophrenic. We would be wearing purple clothes, clicking group photos with our family members wearing purple clothes or with a purple background. We would then share these photos on social media to raise awareness,” she said.

“Those who are diagnosed with schizophrenia must get full support from their family, friends and the society. Schizophrenia can be a remitting relapse illness, but an early diagnosis improves chances of success of treatment and medication.”

“Apart from sharing information on social media about the of nature symptoms, causes and treatment of schizophrenia, we would also shoot a a video on theme ‘I too can break the stigma’ and would be sharing it on social media,” said Dr Jayanath BP , consultant psychiatrist at Kaushambi district hospital.

The Calcutta Khilafat Committee which organises the Eid prayers on Red Road every year has also urged people to pray at home this year and called on the Muslims in the city to adhere to safety guidelines to avoid the spread of the novel coronavirus.

Chief minister Mamata Banerjee has also appealed to Muslims to pray from home during Eid. “The Centre has notified under the Disaster Management Act, 2005 that religious gatherings shall not be allowed. I recall the Eid gatherings at Red Road where I used to participate. But this year I couldn’t offer Puja at Kalighat and won’t be able to take part in Eid celebrations. I would urge you all to stay at home during this Eid. The Bohra community had their Eid today. They also prayed from home,” the CM said.

Nobody could recall the last time Eid prayers were held in mosques without the attendance of the devotees but this year the gates of the shrines have been shut since the lockdown was announced in March.

Eid-ul-Fitr which marks the end of the holy month of Ramazan may fall on Sunday or Monday this year. Muslims across the globe will celebrate their biggest festival under the shadow of the novel coronavirus with millions confined to their homes and reeling with massive monetary losses.

“People will pray at home this year on Eid due to the pandemic. There will be no congregation at Red Road on Eid this year,” read a statement released by Qari Fazlur Rahman who leads the Eid prayers on Red Road every year. “You people have been praying at home the entire month of Ramazan this year due to the lockdown. Similarly, on the day of Eid too you will have to pray in your homes following all the guidelines by the administration on social distancing.”

The administration of Nakhoda Mosque where more than 50,000 people assemble to offer prayers on Eid has issued a statement stating entry into the mosque for the prayers on Eid is prohibited according to the directive of the administration. “Both the state and the central government have notified that all religious places are going to remain shut due to lockdown,” said Nasser Ebrahim, the trustee of the mosque.

On Saturday, several shops resumed business after lockdown restrictions were eased but the usual bustle and business associated with the run-up to the festival was missing. Cyclone Amphan along with the lockdown has dealt a huge financial blow to people bringing down the spending before the festival. “I will not say that people are not buying this year, but it is nowhere even close to previous years. People do not have surplus money because people have been without work for over two months now. Our sales are down by 80%,” said Nadim Siddique, who owns a shop of traditional wear on Rabindra Sarani.

At Esplanade, too, most shops wore a deserted look on Saturday evening in contrast to the packed interiors during previous years before Eid.

Shops selling sewain, spices, dry fruits and sweets witnessed brisk business on Saturday evening.

102,['24/05/2020'],Cusat customizes ‘secure’ web conferencing system,"Kochi: At a time when safety of data is a cause of concern and use of apps like zoom for teleconferencing has been discouraged by ministry of home affairs, Cochin university of science and technology (Cusat) has customized a web conferencing system using a free and open source software (FOSS) for conducting syndicate meetings and open defense of PhD thesis.

“Data safety is always a concern. To ensure data privacy and security, Cusat has installed open-source Jitsi-based online meeting facilities at its data centre. Formal meetings, including syndicate meetings, PhD open defenses, meeting of the board of studies are done through this platform,” said Santhosh Kumar G, professor and director, Centre for Information Management, which coordinates all online activities at Cusat.

He said it is a simple and easy-to-use web conferencing system and ensures the security and privacy of the participants by providing end-to-end encryption and built-in authentication mechanism. The meeting interface is also available as a mobile application.

Jitsi is a set of open-source projects that allows one to easily build and deploy secure video conferencing solutions. Up to 75 participants (up to 35 for the best experience) can meet virtually. A user can blur the background (currently in beta). It also integrates with Slack, Google Calendar, and Office 365.

Generally, to get started with meeting apps, one should give his/her phone number or email ID and the apps needed to be downloaded. In the case of the Cusat web conference system, the invitation is a URL link, something like a website. “We send the link and the password is given through SMS or directly only to university authorities. All these activities are done through our server and not available for access from anywhere else,” Santhosh Kumar said.

As for online classes, Cusat has been actively encouraging its students to join new courses in international universities too. More than 600 students have been daily participating in around 100 courses and taking lessons from Moodle (an open source platform for hosting online learning modules).

Officials said Cusat is also an early adopter of Coursera, a private e-learning platform, which has been making available its courses free for students of universities hit by Covid-19. Cusat students have enrolled in around 3,100 courses, and 222 students have already completed courses successfully and obtained certificates from various universities and institutions.

Santhosh Kumar said teachers have been providing lectures in a video format.

I want to keep getting the inputs from the industry, from various sections of our society, implement what I have announced well and complete that and depending on how things pan out, we have to respond accordingly. We are only two months' old in this year (2020-21 fiscal year), we have ten months to go,"" she said in an interaction with BJP functionary Nalin Kohli.She also said every assumption in the 2020-21 Budget would need a fresh look as they are at a stage that they won't hold good unless reviewed. The FM said the government had helped states with funds and all the dues except the GST compensation cess have been paid.Sitharaman also made it clear that the measures announced by the government to provide funds to the MSME sector could be availed by anyone and banks have been categorically told that anyone who wants to get assistance to restart their businesses should be helped.""What has now become an MSME package, it includes MSME and also aims at touching others. It includes any enterprise with a certain exposure to bank, or with certain invested capital or with a certain turnover, if they need additional term loan, additional working capital in order to buy their raw material to restart in order to be able to pay some fixed costs ....,"" she said.""We are not giving it to the MSMEs at the exclusion of others. Anyone who wants to get some assistance from the bank is very welcome to go and I have made this very clear to the banks also. From June 1, I expect liquidity to flow, credit to flow to be enhanced, term loans to be given additionally without any new collateral. So the sectors that you are referring to can also benefit form this, can also approach banks and this has been made very plain to the banks. And therefore we have not aimed at any one sector in particular nor have we excluded anybody from this,"" she said.Sitharaman also defended the package unveiled by the Centre which amounts to Rs 20.97 lakh crore or 10% of GDP and said it was in line with what other nations had done by including central bank's liquidity actions in their measures.""Every country has brought in a basket of measures, some fiscal , some monetary, some guarantee, some central bank liquidity... they have also gone into liquidity being infused, both through the central banks also their guarantee and other things.

104,['24/05/2020'],Maharashtra tests new surveillance method against coronavirus,"PUNE: The increasing numbers of Covid-19 cases and casualties have prompted public health experts in Maharashtra to adopt a monitoring tactic called “syndromic surveillance” to contain the spread of infection.The new public health tool will proactively survey communities for a group of symptoms — mainly in the elderly and those with pre-existing illnesses — and medically manage them like “positive cases”. This is in addition to current measures such as physical distancing, contact tracing , testing and aggressive treatment.Experts at the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) have called the surveillance pivot a “critical step in risk mitigation” which may prove crucial in “reducing the number of deaths” from Covid-19.Public health expert Subhash Salunke, the technical advisor to the Maharashtra government on Covid-19 containment, said: “I have advised the state government to start syndromic surveillance not only in affected areas but also in areas that have remained relatively naive to the infection. It’s really time to go beyond existing containment measures.”For over two months, the focus of the whole containment exercise in Maharashtra has been limited to keeping daily records of positive cases, deaths, tracing of close contacts, testing, treatment and ensuring physical distancing is in place.Earlier community interviews — carried out during the early days of the outbreak — were also largely limited to questions on travel history and contact.But the new measure actively looks for symptoms. “We need to go beyond and start conducting syndromic surveillance in the community by gathering information on patients with group of influenza-like symptoms - cough, fever, sore throat and shortness of breath — especially among elderly — and those with the pre-existing medical conditions such as diabetes and hypertension during the early phases of illness,” Salunke explained.These individuals, officials said, will then be taken to specialised centres where their symptoms will be managed at early stages. If there's need, they will be treated as any other Covid-positive patient.“More than just testing, this technique will pick up cases of ILI at early stages and treat them like any other positive patient of Covid-19,” Salunke said. The ICMR’s senior epidemiologist, Raman Ganagakhedkar , backed the efficacy of the surveillance technique. “Syndromic surveillance is a critical step in risk mitigation. Its implementation in the state will reduce mortality associated with Covid-19 and to an extent, its spread,” Gangakhedkar told TOI.Unlike swine flu, which causes serious complications in young healthy adults, the novel coronavirus mainly affects the elderly.“Syndromic surveillance, particularly among vulnerable groups, is cost-effective and will reduce deaths. Telling people on how to report early symptoms, in case of influenza-like illnesses, can immensely reduce Covid-19-linked mortality,” said senior epidemiologist Amitav Banerjee. Although the surveillance model was developed to detect quickly the large-scale release or dispersal of a biological agent, researchers over the years have noted that it can be extended to detect novel diseases.According to research by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, “current surveillance goals reach beyond terrorism preparedness”.“Medical-provider reporting remains critical for identifying unusual disease clusters or sentinel cases,” the agency has noted.“Syndromic surveillance might help determine the true size, spread, and tempo of an outbreak after it is detected, or provide reassurance that a large-scale outbreak is not actively occurring, particularly in times of enhanced surveillance.”",pune,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-75935474,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-153604,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/state-tests-new-surveillance-method-against-coronavirus/articleshow/75927849.cms
105,['24/05/2020'],Social distancing goes for a toss amid migrants’ rush,"PRAYAGRAJ: Social distancing took a backseat as hundreds of migrants who arrived in Prayagraj from other cities via special trains on Saturday rushed to reach home by boarding state-run buses.

Most migrants who arrived at Prayagraj Junction were seen flouting social distancing norms while queuing up for medical check-ups, collecting eatables and boarding buses for their native districts.

Each Shramik Special train arriving at Prayagraj Junction brings around 1,600 passengers every day. While alighting from the train to reaching the shed on the city side of the station, many passengers ignore the need to practise social distancing.

“I am helpless as even drivers like me are not been given any personal protection (PPE) kits, gloves and masks. I keep shouting at passengers to stay away from each other, but no one listens. As there is no one to manage them, they pose a real threat to not only themselves but everyone else too,” said Resham Pal Singh, who was one of the drivers driving a UPSRTC bus deployed to ferry migrants arriving at Prayagraj station.

The apathy of authorities only aggravates the problem. Passengers can be seen standing to close to each other, often brushing shoulders while buying eatables from roadside vendors or entering the buses. Even those selling eatables like fruits, cucumbers and other items do not care enough about getting infected to practise social distancing.

Another example of how grossly neglected social distancing is when passengers get down to buy eatables without wearing masks or practising social distancing whenever a Shramik Special train halts at an railway underbridge like the one in South Malaka. On Saturday noon, as one of the Shramik Special trains stopped near Prayagraj Junction, hundreds of migrant labourers got down and came down on the roads to buy cucumber and pan masala being sold by the roadside vendors.

Public relations officer of North Central Railways ’ Prayagraj division SK Gupta said, “Our role is to ensure that passengers reach the station safely and they are handed over to the district administration. There onwards, it is the responsibility of the district administration.”

108,['24/05/2020'],Parents relieved as many schools drop fee-hike plans,"Kochi: Parents, who were worried about school fee hike amid the economic slowdown due to the lockdown caused by the Covid-19 pandemic, heaved a sigh of relief after many city schools decided not to revise the previous term’s fee structure. Schools said there won't be a fee hike this year as it may overburden parents who could be struggling with their jobs. Schools are planning to compensate it by cutting operational cost.

Schools that have decided against increasing the fees include, schools under Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan’s Kochi Kendra, Global Public School, Thiruvaniyur, Gregorian Public School, Maradu, Al Ameen International Public School, Edathala, among others. Some schools that had already revised the fee structure before the pandemic was reported in the country, have re-revised the fee structure. Mostly, there would be a hike of up to 10% from the previous year’s fee when new academic year begins.

""The Bhavan has decided not to increase the fees for 2020-21 and the fees of 2019-20 will continue for the academic year 2020-2021. The school management committee had approved the decision to increase tuition fee by 9% for 2020-21 to meet the increase in salaries and other expenses. However, considering the prevailing situation, the management has decided to roll back the decision. We are sure, the step not to increase the fees will be of some relief to parents in this extraordinary situation,"" said a letter sent to the parents by BVB Kochi Kendra director. Similar intimations to parents were made by other schools too.

TPM Ibrahim Khan, president of Kerala CBSE schools management association, said the decision will cause a revenue dip for schools considering the rising expenditure and teachers’ salary increment. ""However, the situation is not ideal for increasing the fees as many parents might have been facing salary cuts and job losses. The decision is at the discretion of each school management, but it is good to know that many schools have taken the decision,” he said.

PRAYAGRAJ: Although the student fraternity nowadays is relying more on the online mode of studies because of the Covid-19 pandemic but when things become normal, the students of eight selected intermediate colleges and primary/upper primary schools of the Sangam city would be taught in smart-classrooms.

These classrooms are part of the smart city project of Prayagraj wherein a total of 82 smart classrooms would be distributed among these eight institutions on priority.

In fact, the authorities of the firm leading the transformation of Prayagraj into a smart city, has already invited tenders in this regard from interested firms, the last date of which would be ending on May 25.

Giving details about the ambitious project, divisional commissioner and chief executive officer of Prayagraj smart city, Ravi Ranjan informed that as part of the project, a set number of classrooms, would be turned into ‘smart classrooms’ in the selected eight intermediate colleges and primary/upper primary schools of the city. “In the first phase , these classrooms would be equipped with the infrastructure needed for teaching under the ‘smart classroom’ which includes items like desktop computers, servers, projectors, white boards, Wi-Fi routers, UPS etc besides a sturdy and reliable broadband net connection”, the divisional commissioner said. .

“The teachers of these schools and colleges would also receive special training from experts to enable them to teach students using the tools available in these smart classrooms,” he added.

As part of the project, 11 such smart classrooms would be set up at Government Girls Inter College, Civil Lines, nine at Government Girls Inter College, Katra, 32 at Government Boys Inter College , North Malaka, 18 at Bharat Scout and Guide Inter College , Mumfordganj and three smart classrooms each at primary /upper primary schools of Rajapur , Lukerganj, Allenganj and Harwara.

The authorities are of the opinion that the first impact of the initiative in these eight institutions would be accessed and if it is found to be significant on the students, more such classrooms could be set up in other schools and colleges of the district as well, explained the CEO.

As per the plan, the firm entrusted with the task of setting up the classrooms will not only maintain them and ensure their smooth functioning for the next five years but also provide training to the teachers of these institutions, he added.

It will be dangerous if we even wait for this to happen without a vaccine in hand. There will be a high number of deaths,” said Subhash Salunkhe , the technical advisor to the Maharashtra government on Covid-19.“What we need now is an effective vaccine, not herd immunity,” he added.Studies show one out of five people in New York City and one in 10 in Wuhan have developed antibodies against Covid-19. But those numbers, experts said, are still not enough to declare “natural immunity” against a pathogen this infectious.Giridhar Babu, an epidemiologist with the Public Health Foundation of India told TOI that most of the serosurveillance studies show immunity in only a small portion of the population, with disproportionate deaths. “It would be much more devastating if a larger population is infected,” Babu said.The health expert said it would be unethical to even propose that majority of Indians should be infected with the disease to achieve herd immunity. He said that millions of elderly and people with comorbidities will be dangerously impacted.An important failure of the natural herd immunity idea is Sweden. It had decided to do away with a lockdown in hopes of broad population immunity. But as of late April, only 7.3% had developed antibodies.Public health expert R Jotkar added that the wait for herd immunity will strain the healthcare system. “The positivity rate has increased from 3% to 13% in the state, which basically implies that it is very risky to solely rely on herd immunity.

The state government, however, argued that police in both Uttarakhand and Uttar Pradesh have already registered a complaint against Tripathi and his aides and thus, the case does not merit an investigation by the CBI.

The case was heard by a division bench of Chief Justice Ramesh Ranganathan and Justice Ramesh Chandra Khulbe. The bench has given the petitioner a weeks’ time to make Tripathi and all those who travelled to state as respondent in the case.

Kochi: The city police are mulling over shifting more from Home Quarantine ( HQ ) to Institutional Quarantine ( IQ ) in the wake of violations observed during surveillance .

City police commissioner Vijay Sakhare has insisted that those in home quarantine should strictly follow social distancing.

“If people in home quarantine do not stay at home it will cause disastrous consequences to the entire community. We have implemented a multi-layered surveillance system and anyone found in violation would be moved to IQ, which is a government facility,” said Sakhare, adding that the IQ will have necessary facilities. He said the police will guard the IQs round-the-clock.

According to the officials, call data records, internet protocol detail records, CCTV footage and the Covid safety app will be used to conduct surveillance.

“Policemen on bikes are visiting houses where people in home quarantine are staying. However, there is a limit for them to enforce the restriction as those in quarantine can leave the house when the policemen are gone. This is why we are using other monitoring mechanisms to ensure strict adherence to the quarantine. The Covid Safety App, which was a success at Kasaragod would give us info if the person moves beyond 50 metres from his home,” said an official.

The rural police, meanwhile, launched a campaign to generate awareness among those in home quarantine. Rural SP K Karthick interacted with such persons on Saturday. Besides regular patrolling, the rural police are also monitoring those in HQ using their Happy at Home app. So far they have booked 15 cases for violating quarantine.

“We all know that the number of positive cases is going up quickly and most of these positive cases are those who came from other countries and states. So, if quarantine is not maintained things would get ugly. No matter what, we would ensure that returnees are in quarantine,” said SP K Karthick.

117,['24/05/2020'],Church offers a helping hand to the needy,"Kochi: Lack of jobs due to lockdown has plunged several families, especially of daily wagers, into financial crisis. At this juncture, the church has come out with schemes intended to financially assist those parishioners who are struggling to make ends meet.

According to church sources, various parishes in Ernakulam are taking up the initiative to identify and assist those who are in need of financial assistance. Fr Mathew Kilukkan, spokesperson of the Ernakulam-Angamaly archdiocese, said that many churches in the archdiocese have taken up such initiatives.

Fr Thomas Nangelimalil, vicar of Lourde Matha Church, Perumanoor, said in his parish the assistance was provide in three phases.

“At first we provided safety equipment like sanitizers and masks to around 300 families. In the second phase, we identified 50 families who are in need of assistance. Around Rs 3,000 was given as cash to them, as food packets were being distributed by other agencies. Now, in the third phase we are planning to provide another Rs 1,000 as assistance,” said Fr Nangelimalil.

He said that they focused mainly on daily wage earners who became jobless during the lockdown.

Parishes belonging to the Archdiocese of Verapoly also are taking up similar efforts.

Fr Joji Kuthukat, vicar of St Joseph Church and St Jude Church shrine, Thevara, said that they managed to conduct some relief activity even though the income of the parish drastically fell due to lockdown.

“We managed to provide assistance with the help of well-wishers. There are 217 families in the parish and all of them were given Rs 500 each apart from providing rice and dal bags. Also, our family units had collected a significant amount for their annual day celebrations. So we decided to identify the needy and provide them with financial aid of Rs 2,000 to Rs 3,000. Apart from parishioners, those from other religions who are living amidst us were also provided with assistance,” he said.

The priest said that the parish managed to do charity work of about Rs 8 lakh during the lockdown.

Fr Sojan Maliekkal, spokesperson of the Archdiocese of Verapoly, said that individual parishes as well as archdiocese as a whole were conducting relief works.“The archdiocese had earlier provided financial assistance to those who were working at churches and were rendered jobless due to the closure of churches. Organizations and parishes in the archdiocese were also busy during the lockdown period doing relief works as per the direction of archbishop Joseph Kalathiparambil,” said Fr Maliekkal.

I asked the talathi to use our six houses to quarantine people so that they can feel like living at home.” Each row house has a living room, two bedrooms, a toilet and bathroom.The family is yet to hold a housewarming ceremony of the houses but they have chosen to forgo tradition in a time of crisis. “Ensuring people are healthy is more important. All six of us unanimously took the decision and handed over our houses to the tehsil administration for as long as they want to use them,” Hagawane said.The village talathi Deepak Kadjure said, “About 400 families have returned to the village from Pune and Mumbai over the last two weeks. We don’t have adequate facilities to quarantine them in the village. Currently, we have kept 18 villagers, including six children, in two row houses. The remaining houses will be used as and when needed in the future.”The village sarpanch Santosh Saaid added that the Hagawane family is also providing food to the quarantined people. “This is a big help for us and sets an example for others,” shared Saaid.According to the tehsil administration, about 10, 000 people have returned to over 110 villages in the last two weeks.

CHENNAI: Amid confusion over passenger flight operations to Chennai, the Airports Authority of India (AAI) began preparations on its part at the Chennai airport from Monday.

Sources said the activity began after the Tamil Nadu government greenlighted departures but not arrivals. A decision will be taken on Sunday. But only departures will mean planes will have to return empty, which may make the airlines reconsider operating flights from Chennai. Alternately, if the state government’s departure-only policy is rejected by the civil aviation ministry, the state will have to arrange quarantine facilities for all domestic passengers — around 6,000 — expected to arrive daily.

On Monday, planes were being spruced up, markings on taxiways and parking bays were repainted to get the airport ready to receive flights. A senior official said, ""We are going ahead with preparations to perfect entry and check-in procedures, most of which need to be done by passengers themselves. This may pose a mild delay but airline staff will be posted near check-in counters and security check areas so that passengers can be assisted."" An airline official said, ""Planes are being readied as per the safety notification from DGCA to resume operations."" On Saturday, aircraft engineers were seen checking planes and engines. Staff have been told to report for work. There may be trials on Sunday so that there is no confusion when passengers start arriving.

AAI is trying to urge the state government to arrange vehicles for passengers to reach the airport.

HYDERABAD: Telangana reported 52 fresh positive cases for coronavirus and one death on Saturday. With this the state has had 1,813 cases. The death toll stands at 49, just one shy of 50.

Among the fresh cases, 33 have been reported in Greater Hyderabad and 19 were migrants and foreign evacuees. For the past few days, Greater Hyderabad has seen most of the fresh cases. This has left officials worried given that the lockdown has been eased and a large number of businesses and offices have opened up. On Friday, 42 cases were reported in Greater Hyderabad alone.

The state government issued a statement on Saturday saying that 15 migrant workers who returned from Maharashtra and four Telangana residents who came back from Kuwait were among the fresh cases. While 696 people are being treated for the Covid-19, 1,068 were cured and have been discharged till now. This includes the 25 who were discharged on Saturday.

Officials said that a large number of migrants are entering the state from various other states. “The evacuees from other countries who are arriving at the Hyderabad are being screened, especially those who are showing symptoms of Covid-19.

NAGPUR: To ensure that the air remains clean forever like how it is during lockdown now, 12-year-old climate activist from Dehradun Ridhima Pandey is launching a nationwide digital campaign. She was one of the 16 children to petition the United Nations in September last year on governments' inaction towards combating climate change.

The nationwide lockdown has led to drastic improvement in the air quality. On May 21, TOI had reported the findings of UK-head quartered Nature Climate Change which said that carbon levels had dropped to 2006 levels. It has also brought a steady dip in the Air Quality Index (AQI) with average levels hovering around 60. At its worst, it goes beyond 500.

As part of the campaign, a new video titled #SaalBhar60 was released on Saturday by Jhatkaa.org. The video calls on citizens to participate in a nationwide digital movement on June 5, World Environment Day, by sharing photos from their city demanding ‘Clean Air for All’.

A corresponding petition on the platform is asking for the initiation of a Clean Air Boss who will solely be in-charge of reducing air pollution levels.

According to the National Clean Air Programme (NCAP), the country has 122 non-attainment cities which do not meet the national ambient air quality standards. Maharashtra tops this list with 18 non-attainment cities in the state.

The initiative invites citizens from these cities to participate in the digital movement demanding ‘Saal Bhar 60’. “Citizens will be asking the government to put in place concrete measures to ensure air quality in India remains within permissible, healthy standards even after the lockdown ends,” a press release stated.

“In the past two months, it has felt like all the things my generation has been fighting were gifted to us — blue skies, low emissions, clean air. This only means that an AQI of ‘Saal Bhar 60’ is possible. Our government needs to treat it like the emergency it is, and have strict timelines for bringing down pollution levels. Breathing clean air is a basic right,” says Ridhima Pandey.

Stating that Covid-19 pandemic has shown us two things, lung surgeon at Sir Ganga Ram Hospital in New Delhi says, “First, that we too can have clean air. Second, how bad air can affect our health, increasing our vulnerability to diseases. Studies from Harvard and Italy have shown a significantly higher number of Covid-19 cases and mortality in areas with high Air Pollution. High levels of air pollution across Indian cities pose a major threat to the well-being of our children.”

Several environment groups across India including Let Me Breathe, Fridays For Future, Let India Breathe, Greenpeace India, Waatavaran Foundation, Help Delhi Breathe, My Right To Breathe, Kolkata Clean Air forum, Mumbai's Aarey Conservation Group and Awaaz Foundation are supporting this initiative.

Campaigns manager at Jhatkaa.org Shikha Kumar says, “We have made strides towards acknowledging the severity of the problem as evidenced by initiatives like NCAP. But we need concrete state-wise planning and implementation for Saal Bhar 60 to be a reality.”

THENI: The Theni district police have arrested the proprietor and manager of a private transport company as they used fake e-pass to ply two buses to bring Tamils from Maharashtra to Theni.

Andipatti deputy superintendent of police S Seenivasan said that police teams posted at Andipatti Pass stopped the vehicles and conducted a check. When the QR code on the e-pass was scanned, the pass was found to be fake. Investigation revealed that the vehicle operators used another pass issued by Madurai district administration by making changes like vehicle number and date.

Police said that the buses have been seized. Proprietor of the buses Shanmuganathan and manager Senthil Kumaran were arrested and remanded in prison under judicial custody.

“Inquiries also revealed that the same bus operator had used the vehicle to shift people from Maharashtra to Theni earlier also using the same fake pass. They had dropped passengers in Batlagundu and did not enter Theni district. Passengers, who walked into the district, had undergone testing,” Seenivasan said.

Meanwhile, a detailed inquiry was underway to find whether drivers Ramaiah and Pichaimani were complicit to the crime. They also have been asked to go into self-isolation since they moved closely with the passengers. They will be arrested if they knew that the passes were fake, a police officer said.

He added that passengers had paid thousands of rupees to return to Theni. Although, exact amount they paid will come to light during detailed inquiry, it is clear that the bus operator had fleeced as much money as possible depending on the passenger and seat availability.

There were 30 passengers in each vehicle, who were tested for Covid-19 as soon as they arrived in Andipatti in Theni district on Friday night. A police officer said that those, who had tested positive, were shifted to the government hospital for treatment, while those who tested negative were sent home. They were asked to self-isolate as per instruction from health authorities.

Many have even offered their facilities to others for a proper bath.For two nights straight, Thakurpukur resident Atreyee Roy Chowdhury struggled with her four-year-old daughter without any power and water at her apartment. That was before her neighbour from the next building, which ran on a different phase and still had power, came to her rescue. “The young boy living in the next apartment himself came to our home by himself with a pedestal fan, an LED bulb and a heap of wires. He said his family was pained to see my daughter suffer in the heat and connected the light and the fan from their house all by themselves. Prior to Friday, we hardly used to interact but he came in as our guardian angel in this time of emergency ,” said Roy Chowdhury, a homemaker. She added that seeing the youth helping them, many other neighbours came in support of other residents.At Garia Mahamayatala, a local stationary shop owner whose shop had power emptied the store refrigerators and asked locals to keep their food in his refrigerator to ensure that they did not get spoiled. “This is the least I could do for them. I also asked them to charge their cellphones and emergency lamps at my store,” said Swapan Jana, the store owner.Jadavpur resident Subhasree Basu posted on Facebook that electricity was back at their home after two days and they were ready to help anyone who needed to charge their cellphone or get fresh filtered water. “This is the time when we need to help one another. We should not lose patience,” said Basu, who runs a boutique at her home.With internet and mobile networks kaput, many outside Kolkata were unable to contact their kin in the city after the storm. Many of them sought help over social media when good Samaritans came to their aid. “I was unable to contact my parents since the day of the cyclone and was very worried about them.

I have never seen so many faults occur at once. The cyclone decimated the power lines in nearly half the licensed areas,” CESC vice-president Avijit Ghosh said.The repair and restoration work is faceing multiple challenges. Workmen fear the anger brewing in localities that are without power for 72 hours now may soon result in assault. The team members are weary after working 16 hours a day for three days in succession and desperately need a break. But the Covid crisis and lockdown have further complicated matters as half the workforce could not report to duty. Of the 140 repair teams that CESC engages daily, it now has only 60 at hand as the rest returned to their homes before the lockdown.Sources in CESC said around three lakh consumers or 12 lakh people are without power. The blackout localities include Bansdroni, Netajinagar, Garia, Patuli, New Garia, Survey Park, Mukundapur, Gangulibagan, Ramgarh, Sapuipara, Sahitnagar, Kasba, Lake Gardens, Dum Dum and adjoining areas in north Kolkata as well as Howrah. All these localities have overhead power lines unlike the rest south, central and north Kolkata where the network is underground.Apologizing to consumers who were still without power, Ghosh said that while he empathized with their pain and suffering, there was no quick-fix solution to the vexed problem.“There is anger on the ground and that is completely justified. Living without electricity and water (due to to the power cuts) in summer is extreme hardship. We wish we could repair and restore the supplies quicker. But there is no technological solution. It has to be done manually. The nature and scale of disruption is such that it will take time. We are not in a position to say how long. We may in a better position by Tuesday to say how much longer it will take,” the executive said.“Normally, if there is a fault in one area, we have redundancy in the network.

BHOPAL: More than 5 lakh migrant workers of Madhya Pradesh have been brought back to the state by the government so far and more than 200 of them have tested positive till now.

Unlike other states, where all the migrant workers who are returning home, are being sent to institutional quarantine, in Madhya Pradesh only those who are screened with symptoms or have come from high-risk zones are sent for institutional quarantine. Others are sent to home quarantine.

As per official sources, till May 22, a little more than 5 lakh workers have been brought to MP from different states of the country. While more than 2 lakh have been brought back from Gujarat, more than 1 lakh have been brought back from Rajasthan, more than 1 lakh have been brought back from Maharashtra. Apart from these, labourers have been brought back from Goa, Delhi, Punjab, Haryana, Kerala, Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu and Telangana. Around 1.5 lakh have been brought back using buses, while around 3.5 lakh have been brought back through Sharmik Express trains, said sources.

Sources from the health department said that between 200 and 300 of the total patients who have been tested positive so far are migrant labourers. In districts like Seoni, Mandla,Satna,Shahdol, Umaria, Singrauli, Sidhi, Rewa, Tikamgarh, Panna and Sagar, where there are less number of positive cases, but a majority of the positive cases are of migrant workers.

In Gwalior too, a majority of migrant workers have tested positive. When contacted over the issue, additional chief secretary, health, Mohammed Suleman, said, “People who are brought from other states are first screened at their district borders and if there are any symptoms or if they have come from high-risk zones, they are sent to institutional quarantine, the remaining are sent to home quarantine. Monitoring is being done by health department staffers and those in home quarantine are being monitored by village panchayats and local health workers”.

Sources said that there are more than 5 lakh people and keeping such a big population in institutional quarantine is a herculean task for the administration. However, efforts are being taken to effectively monitor these patients. A majority of those who have tested positive were found during the screening done at the district borders, said sources.

129,['24/05/2020'],"Restrictions eased, but grocery prices burn a hole in pockets","Madurai: Even after the supply of essential commodities has become smooth after the restrictions on vehicle movements were lifted, prices of essential items are yet to come back to normal.

Prices of essentials had increased by 20 to 30% with the implementation of the restrictions. While the price difference has come down to 10% in semi-retail shops in East Masi Street, a hub for groceries, price has barely come down in smaller retail stores in various parts of the city and the peripheral areas.

V Saravanan, a resident of Karuppayurani, said that prices have come down in his locality as he recently purchased one litre of palm oil for Rs 110, which used to be Rs 80-90 before the lockdown. Similarly, the price of rava, which was Rs 50 before lockdown, is still selling at Rs 60 to Rs 80. “At a time when people have lost their livelihood and they are yet to start earning, prices of essentials continue to burn a hole in the pockets of people,” he said.

Residents say that the same situation prevails in many pockets in Madurai city and its outskirts. These shops do not provide any bills for purchases and that makes it difficult for them to raise an issue with the authorities.

A grocery store owner from Karuppayurani said that he had procured groceries in bulk when the price was high, and he cannot bring down the price until the stocks are sold, he said.

G Paulraj, president of Madurai Grocery Retail Traders Association, said although materials supply from north India is yet to fully resume, required products are very much available in Madurai. Earlier, there was a restriction on vehicles to access East Masi Street, but now it has been eased out, and people can directly go there. Price will automatically come down, if grocery store owners in rural areas find no takers, he said.

He further said that only a few branded products in flour variety, noodles, atta and tea power are yet to available freely in market.

130,['24/05/2020'],"Uttarakhand: In search of 3G, schoolkids in hills trek long, trudge through dense forests","A student searches for mobile phone signals in Pithoragarh

DEHRADUN: The switch from classrooms to screens has come at a heavy cost for students in remote hills where lagging internet is obstructing learning. In Uttarakhand , which has 10 districts in the hills and only three in plains, students told TOI they were trekking several kilometres every day in search of better internet connectivity, sometimes even through dense forests.

In Almora, Ghanshyam Singh Taragi, father of three school-going children, told TOI his kids have to move around the forest teeming with wild animals to catch signals on the phone for online classes. “Sometimes, I accompany them, but we have only one smartphone so all of them have to use it during different times of the day.”

In Pithoragrah’s Jhulaghat, students have resorted to taking notes from others whose houses have broadband connection. Some have purchased Nepalese sims — which have better network in the region — but the residents said data charges were much higher compared with network providers in India and not everyone could afford them. “For instance, 1GB of data costs Rs 45 and has a day’s validity,” said Surendra Kumar, a resident.

In villages of Dundu, Talla Charma and Malan in Pithoragarh , at least 35 students said it was difficult to find signals to attend online classes and often they ended up missing large chunks of conversation during lessons.

While the problem of network connectivity is worse in the hilly regions, students even in villages in the outskirts of the state capital Dehradun are grappling with similar issues. Jayshree Uraon, a class 12 student in Burans Khanda village, told TOI, “With the network connectivity I have at home, we can barely make conversations, forget using internet or downloading videos. On days that I’m lucky, I get good connectivity after walking for a few metres, on other days I have to be on foot for an hour.”

In some parts, students now go out in groups. “This helps them ward off wild animals instead of each person walking around, looking for a signal,” said Kamleshwar Bhatt, a schoolteacher in Dehradun.

Other schoolteachers were also aware of the problems being faced by the students, but said they had no option than to continue online classes. Sonika Ramola, a teacher in Almora, said her students had also complained about having to walk for kilometres for digital connectivity. “They are struggling but having online classes is at least better than not having them at all.”

A top official in the education department said that school authorities have been told to provide printed notes to students who are struggling with online connectivity.

Beena Verma, principal of the Government Girls Inter College in Daulaghat (Almora), said they had started home delivery of printed notes to students who don’t have mobile phones or are finding it hard to access internet.

Explaining why network connectivity remains an issue in the hills, Arun Verma, deputy director general of the department of telecommunications (Uttarakhand), told TOI, there is a strict limit to the number of mobile towers that can be installed in a region which is why some areas face connectivity issues. “In the hills, the number of 3G and 4G towers is much less anyway because the population is scattered and it is not commercially viable for operators to install multiple towers. Sometimes, high peaks also obstruct signals,” he said. Verma added that since majority of the state’s population was living in plain districts, the state had good mobile network coverage population-wise.

District magistrate Brahmadeo Ram Tiwari, SSP/DIG Anant Deo and chief medical officer Dr Ashok Kumar Shukla decided to withdraw hotspot status of the medical college, Kotwali, Juhi Parampurwa , Jajmau police outpost and Beconganj and shifted them into green zones. According to the CMO, as not a single positive case was found these areas, hence it was decided to withdraw status of the hotspot. He said as these areas have been shifted into a green zone, the administration has therefore allowed opening of shops, offices and markets. The committee decided to shift Karbi village of Maharajpur, Shivkatra of Chakeri and Meerpur into orange zone. The city at present has 15 hotspots. Barra and Govind Nagar areas have been included hot pots due to detection of corona positive cases.

134,['24/05/2020'],"Feel at home, rent can wait","CHENNAI: It has been almost two months since city musician Sashank M did a show. While he and his bandmates explore new business models for their work online, one thing less they have to worry about during this crunch is paying the house rent . Their house owner, architect Mohamed Rasheed, decided to go easy on the boys during the lockdown, and is among a small tribe of landlords who are going beyond the otherwise sacrosanct rental agreement to make some humanitarian exceptions in these difficult times.

""The agreement is a piece of paper. But the gravity of the pandemic has impacted us all in one way or the other. My father always said owning a house didn’t make you a boss, it is what kind of a person you are during times of crisis that made the cut,"" says Rasheed, who also used this opportunity to pay the electricity bill for a bunch of student tenants staying on another of his other properties.

In many cases, house owners looking to waive rent, also do so considering families solely surviving on revenue from businesses poorly hit on account of the Covid-19 lockdown. For instance, the lockdown has been tough on the food service industry, particularly small, hole-in-the-wall eateries that don’t find a place on online delivery platforms now either. Chennai octogenarian C Parthasarathy foresaw this in early March, before the lockdown was imposed, and rang up his tenant, a restaurant owner, to assure him he need not pay the rent until his business stabilised. ""He has school-going children and is the sole earning member of his family. Even after lockdown is lifted, the future of these businesses is uncertain and at such times, a monthly rent is often a big expense and a cause of anxiety,"" says Parthasarathy. ""People are particular about the kind of house owners they get, but good tenants too are rare, and mine has been one of the house’s best caretakers so far, and always paid on time.""

In April, 41-year-old Koduri Balalingam of Hyderabad volunteered to go without a total monthly earning of `3.2 lakh, which he usually receives as rent from three properties he owns in the city. They are mostly one BHK homes inhabited by small scale industry workers from Bihar, who had been left without work during the lockdown.

""I own a manufacturing unit myself and I’ve been involved in social service for the past 12 years. I understand the plight of these vulnerable communities and assured them that amid the financial crunch they’re already facing, they needn’t worry about the rent. They have gradually begun to resume work just this month and a few volunteered to pay 50% rent, but I have left the choice to them. They can pay up when their other basic needs are taken care of,"" says Balalingam, who also distributed close to `3 lakh to poor families.

For many young entrepreneurs living away from home during the pandemic, benevolent house owners have almost stepped in like family members to ease the strain.

""These are times when a little help goes a long way. For some of us, our parents live in other cities and having a roof above our heads is a blessing in itself. The fact that our essential needs are taken care of, helps us focus on the road ahead, "" says Sashank.

IMCH has commenced trial run of the facility covering pregnant women arrivals in the district who are self-isolating.

A first-of-its-kind facility in north Kerala, the initiative was taken to reduce hospital visits of these women to eliminate the chances for hospital-level transmission of diseases.

IMCH has an exclusive number for the video-call facility, which also provides counselling services. IMCH has formed a panel of experts of various departments at the hospital to address the health issues of expectant mothers.

According to the district administration, the health department has placed 109 pregnant women arriving from overseas under home quarantine.

Dr A M Nurul Ameen, deputy superintendent of IMCH, said that many pregnant women in mandatory quarantine have expressed anxiety about their health- and stress-related issues. “We also impart counselling to them. An expectant mother desirous of normal delivery needs to pay 10 to 12 visits to the hospital for routine consultations. The video conferencing facility will help to reduce hospital visits during the period of the pandemic. Only those who are in need of medical consultation will be asked to approach the hospitals,’’ he said.

“In the coming days this facility will be expanded to cover the entire state,’’ he said.

Dr C Sreekumar, superintendent of IMCH, said the facility will be officially launched next week after rectifying anomalies detected during the trial run.

But, in the past couple of weeks, Anuradha has noticed that her daughter turns moody and irritable soon after the class.

""She is angry when I tell her it is time for class and often throws a tantrum soon after it for no particular reason,"" says Anuradha. It’s only when she discussed it with a psychologist friend that she realised that the video calls — with her teacher, friends and family — only remind her daughter of how much her life has changed.

‘Zoom fatigue’ as many choose to term it, is real for kids and adults alike, but children often are not able to verbalise their feelings, says experts. And the extended screen time — whether it is for education purposes, hobby classes, or virtual playdates — could be affecting children, especially, younger ones, emotionally. ""Some schools have begun virtual classes. And children have told me that though they are attending classes, they miss the camaraderie of being in a classroom,"" says Dr Shiva Prakash, consultant child psychiatrist, Schizophrenia Research Foundation India. ""Home is meant for play and summer vacation but all of a sudden that space has been intruded upon and it’s tough.""

That has to do with the way people organise things in the head, he adds. ""In school, you are expected to be doing a certain thing at a certain time but that’s changed,"" says Dr Shiva Prakash.

""Also, at home, you usually expect to be in an airconditioned room watching a cartoon but now you are facing a teacher on camera and studying. So when expectation doesn’t match reality, kids can feel frustrated. For older children, who couldn’t finish exams, the constant uncertainty can also be stressful.""

Psychologist Mini Rao says that social interaction is a must for children. ""Constantly staying in the house, not meeting family and friends but meeting them virtually is a huge and sudden change for children,"" she says, adding that parents should refrain from signing up children for too many online classes.

""It can have many psychological consequences — a sudden negative change like this, which restricts a child from leading a normal life like going to school and coming back, going out to play, or inviting their friends can make them irritable, moody, withdrawn, and feel helpless and frustrated about their situation,"" she says.

Parents and teachers can help children in a number of ways. ""Allow the child to choose which friend they would want to speak to. In virtual classrooms, the teacher can give a five-minute break so kids can greet each other and chat. It would create an artificially real experience of what would happen if the teacher steps out of the classroom,"" says Dr Shiva Prakash, adding that children are resilient and will adjust to the new reality.

""Schedule weekly family calls and enhance that interaction by playing virtual games together. Create a routine as it gives children a sense of security and stability,"" says Mini. ""Also encourage them to exercise. Don’t be too harsh on them by organising all kinds of online classes like singing, dancing, maths and science,"" she says.

""They are children, give them space and time to adjust to their temporary virtual life. Don’t push your children to do anything they don’t want to. There is no need to hurry up their childhood, let them enjoy their time.""

We are questioning to know if they are involved in more such thefts,” added Bagdugar.On May 11, the Congress councillor of Amraiwadi, Jagdish Rathod, had shot off a letter to the superintendent of Civil Hospital, M M Prabhakar, alleging that Rajput’s belongings had been stolen after she died of the virus. Her husband, Shivpujan Rajput, went to Civil Hospital after he was informed of her death and he discovered that the belongings were missing.“We first checked the cameras but it was of no help as they were wearing PPE when they entered the ward and could not be recognized,” said inspector A K Patel of Shahibaug police station.Patel said they then checked the register and learned that Patel had not been on duty since May 8 but had been seen by other employees sanitizing the bodies of Covid-19 victims. “We suspected his involvement and he later confessed to the crime and named Amit Sharma as his accomplice,” added Patel.Badgujar said the process of recovering the stolen ornaments is underway.",ahmedabad,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-75932816,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-160684,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/2-held-for-jewellery-thefts-from-covid-corpses/articleshow/75927220.cms

PATNA: A 55-year-old man was beaten to death by a mob after he fired at a pet dog of his neighbour for repeatedly barking at him in a village in Rohtas district late on Friday night. A 10-year-old girl also received bullet injuries in her hand, police said.

“The incident took place at Beladhi village Darihat police station area in the district around 9.30 pm when the pet dog belonging to one Vinod Ram started barking at his neighbour Gopal Ram, who fired two shots at the animal which missed the target,” said SHO of Darigaon police station Umersh Kumar.

He added, “The third bullet, however, hit Vinod’s daughter Bhumika Kumari who came rushing after hearing the gunshots. She was taken to Sasaram sadar hospital where she is undergoing treatment and is stated to be out of danger.”

Enraged by the firing, villagers started thrashing Gopal with sticks leading to grievous head injuries. He was admitted to the hospital at Sasaram where he succumbed to his injuries on Saturday morning.

“Villagers attacked Gopal in a fit of rage, but their motive was not to kill him. Still the grievous injuries he received proved fatal for him,” the girl’s father Vinod said.

The SHO said raids were on to arrest the people involved in the incident. “Two separate FIRs have been lodged in connection with incident. While the first FIR deals with firing by the deceased in which a girl was injured, the second FIR is related with murderous attack on Gopal,” he added.

Sasaram SDPO Laxman Prasad said, “The identity of those involved in the attack on Gopal Ram is being ascertained. The culprits won’t be spared.”

TIRUPATI: Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams, the richest temple body in the country, plans to raise around Rs 100 crore by disposing of its ‘unviable’ properties across the country and allocating vacant cottages under the cottage donation scheme.

The proposal to create a monetisation fund of Rs 100 crore was approved by the TTD trust board during its ‘budget’ meeting in Tirumala on February 29. A sub-committee was formed by the then temple board in 2015 during the erstwhile TDP regime to take a call on disposing of the temple’s unviable assets.

The sub-committee proposed to dispose of around 50 properties that are situated at faraway places and difficult to maintain for the TTD. Such properties include house sites, buildings and agricultural lands. Subsequently, the TTD categorised its assets into four categories — the ones mired in legal tangles, rural properties, urban properties in other states including AP, and those to be auctioned by TTD directly.

While three properties in Coimbatore, Tiruvannamalai and Vellore districts of Tamil Nadu were struck off the auction list due to legal problems, 17 rural properties in AP were proposed to be disposed of through public auction involving the respective district collectors.

Nine urban area properties in Telangana, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka and Odisha besides AP were proposed to be auctioned off through MSTC Ltd, Visakhapatnam, while the TTD estate officer was entrusted with the responsibility of disposing of 23 other properties spread across various states.

AHMEDABAD: The Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation has decided to give 10% rebate to property owners who wish to pay advance property tax for the year 2020-21.

Standing committee chairman Amul Bhatt and mayor Bijal Patel said in a statement that the corporation has decided that property owners who have paid property taxes for the year 2019-20 and wish to pay advance taxes can do so between June 1 and June 30. And those paying taxes for the year 2020-21 will be eligible for the rebate.

Bhatt said that the maximum rebate was 10% and the scheme was announced for the year 2019-20 as well and over 4 lakh had availed of it. This year, the corporation expects a similar response, officials said.

A senior officer said that the rebate will benefit businesspersons in the city as they have to pay commercial property taxes which are on the higher side. He, however, also noted that business establishments have not been operating since March after the lockdown began. He said that with virtually no income, the corporation wanted money not only to run the anti Covid-19 operation but also to pay contractors who want to begin work again in the city.

158,['24/05/2020'],Nepalese army to build unfinished road along border,"PITHORAGARH: Amid the escalating India-Nepal border tension, the Nepalese government has restarted work on the 130-km-long Darchula-Tinkar road project in Darchula district of Nepal . According to sources, the road project was sanctioned in 2008 to facilitate Nepal-China border trade through the Tinkar Pass. Around 50-km of the road for this project runs parallel with the Indian border along Uttarakhand.It was presumed that the road project will promote not just trade but also pilgrim and tourist traffic in the area. However, almost 12 years on, only 43-km of the road has been laid. The reason behind the delay, according to sources in Nepal, is the tough and rocky terrain of the route and the shortage of explosive material to blow away hard rock to open the track for the road. With continuous monetary losses, the contractor had also left the job, as per the source.The sources confirmed that the project has now been taken up again and the Nepalese government has decided that their Army would complete the remaining portion of the road.The restarting of the project assumes significance in wake of the protests being registered by Nepal at an almost 80-km-long road inaugurated by Union defence minister Rajnath Singh on May 8. The road will allow vehicular movement till near the Lipulekh Pass , which is regarded as the gateway to Tibet. Nepal has been claiming the Pass as part of its own territory. In the middle of last week, 25 armed personnel of Nepal Police had reached Chhangru by helicopter to set up an armed police outpost which is situated some distance away from the Pass. A few days ago, the Nepalese government had started preparations to open three more similar border outposts (BOPs) along the India-Nepal border in Uttarakhand.Meanwhile, a source told TOI that the official reason behind restarting the road project is to enable movement of people of Tinkar and Chhangru which are migratory villages. “The villagers were either using the unfinished track or the Indian side of the roads to reach the lower valleys in winter. But this year, because of the Covid-19 lockdown, the roads were blocked and the villagers were constantly demanding that the government help them so that they can move to their villages,” said the source.In order to finish the remaining 87-km track, the source said, the Army is in the process of setting up a base camp at Ghatiabaghar. “Their first step would be to clear the mule track at Ghatiabaghar where a 400 meter stretch is currently blocked,” the source added.",dehradun,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-47529300,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-110164,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/nepalese-army-to-build-unfinished-road-along-border/articleshow/75924668.cms

In a representation to Manisha Verma, principal secretary, tribal development department , Zaduram Janglu Halami, president of group of 80 gram sabhas called as Korchi Mahagramsabha , said, “The collector sealed these accounts on March 18, without any notice. Over 10,000 tendu workers have been deprived of wages towards plucking of tendu leaves.”

“Contractors are unable to deposit the money in our bank accounts. The payment is towards receipts of tendu leaves collected from forest under community forest rights (CFRs),” Halami said.

Of the 19 gram sabhas, 16 are from Korchi taluka while three are from Kurkheda. The accounts were sealed on March 18 after Singla noticed some irregularities.

“The gram sabhas learnt about it only on April 18, when a cheque of Rs2 lakh handed over to a grocery trader bounced. This payment was towards material procured to help locals during lockdown,” says Halami.

On the contrary, Singla says, “Over Rs65-80 lakh has been deposited in each of the 19 gram sabha bank accounts before I took charge as collector. Interestingly, this money was deposited by opening another account and not the regular account operated by these grams sabhas.”

Singla told TOI, “The money was paid by the user agency towards compensation for diversion of CFR forest area. This money is meant for benefit of the communities and welfare of the villagers. So, how can some individuals open accounts to deposit this money. There is no government representative as joint account holder in the newly opened accounts like it is for other routine CFR account.”

“I have ordered probe and if the committee headed by SDO gives a clean chit I have no problems. My intention is that there should be transparency while utilization of this huge money. The report will be submitted by June 10,” said Singla.

In a latest instruction, Dr Shinde has urged the personnel to report any sickness or uneasiness experienced by him or her while on duty and refrain from getting admitted on their own. “We have maintained medical records of more than 8,600 personnel at our hospital and the data can be made available for any check-ups or treatment at any point of time,” he said.

Dr Shinde attributed the preparation to fight Covid within the force to CP Upadhyay , joint CP Ravindra Kadam and DCP, headquarters, Vikram Sali. “There is no stigma attached to this disease and we have made it clear to our personnel not to waste time or panic with simple cold and cough,” he said.

174,['24/05/2020'],Delhi: Dara Shukoh’s cenotaph found? Official claims ‘101% certainty’,"New Delhi: A South Delhi Municipal Corporation official claims to have identified Mughal prince Dara Shukoh’s cenotaph . He has done it independent of the expert committee set up by the central government for precisely this objective. Experts aren’t too sure about Sanjeev Kumar Singh’s “101% certainty” about the find, and all eyes are now on the expert panel.Singh, an assistant engineer with the municipal corporation, said he was intrigued by the mystery around the final resting place of Dara Shukoh, the eldest son of Emperor Shah Jahan. Historians have maintained that the mortal remains of the prince were interred in an unknown crypt at Humayun’s Tomb , and so his grave is unidentifiable and could be any among the many graves in the lower level of the mausoleum. Some of these graves have open-air cenotaphs on the first-floor terrace .But after two-and-a-half years of research, Singh thinks otherwise. “I compared the available evidence, but two specifics caught my attention,” he told TOI. “One, a reference in Alamgirnamah saying Prince Dara was buried next to the graves of Prince Daniyal and Prince Murad, Emperor Akbar ’s sons, and the second, Emperor Aurangzeb ordering repairs to Dara’s grave, putting a chaddar over it, and appointing caretakers.”Singh studied the cenotaphs in the antechambers of the Humayun mausoleum. “In one antechamber, there are three cenotaphs belonging to men. One of the three is different. It has a flower motif on top of the mihrab, which the other two lack. Even the mihrab design differs slightly from the others and appears to belong to the Shah Jahan period,” Singh said.Dr Syed Jamal Hasan, retired Archaeological Survey of India director and member of the central government’s committee to identify Dara’s grave, told TOI that the design might be different but it was difficult to say for certain that the cenotaph belonged to the prince in the absence of any writing on the cenotaph indicating as such. “Because of the Covid lockdown, our committee is yet to visit the tomb crypt to analyse the graves there. Until we go and see it and match it with what the texts say, we cannot say anything,” Dr Hasan said.And what about the Alamgirnamah? TOI shared the reference cited from it with historians Supriya Gandhi of Yale University and Ali Nadeem Rezavi, former head of history department at Aligarh Muslim University and president of Aligarh Society of History and Archaeology. Both said the passage only said Dara “was buried in the tahkhana under the domed structure of the tomb, where Murad and Daniyal are also buried”. Gandhi, who recently wrote Dara Shukoh: The Emperor Who Never Was, relying on Persian sources, said, “Murad and Daniyal are certainly mentioned, but no exact location is identified. Moreover, the reference is to where he is interred, not where his tombstone is.”Prof Rezavi concurred. “The records only say he was buried in Humayun’s Tomb complex, not exactly where. For Aurangzeb to have a known grave for his brother would have been suicidal because Dara was a Sufi and public knowledge of his tomb would have turned it into a Sufi shrine,” he said.Singh also referred to Sir Jadunath Sarkar’s monumental work, A History of Aurangzib, to say Emperor Aurangzeb had, on September 5, 1669, ordered repairs to Dara’s tomb, placing of a chaddar over it and appointment of caretakers. Gandhi said, “News reports from Alamgir's court suggest that Dara's grave had a visible tombstone covered with a shroud. Even so, it is difficult to use the ornate, literary text of chronicles to identify the exact location of the grave. There is a history of misreading rhetorical statements in chronicles such as Amal-i Salih as literal descriptions of Dara Shukoh’s burial place.”While adding that 20th century local tradition held Dara's tombstone to be on the terrace of Humayun’s tomb, she asserted, “It’s not, however, the one with the cleft stone that is today popularly associated with the prince.”Rezavi said historical sources had to be read with caution. “It is for a reason that historians have maintained it’s not possible to identify the grave on the basis of literary evidence. This latest research is conjecture. That’s fine, but as a historian I am sceptical.”",delhi,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-75938297,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-160423,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/dara-shukohs-cenotaph-found-official-claims-101-certainty/articleshow/75928015.cms

176,['24/05/2020'],Rajasthan: SHO commits suicide in Churu,"People gather outside Rajgarh police station demanding probe into the alleged suicide.

JAIPUR: Vishnudutt Bishnoi , the SHO of Rajgarh in Churu district, hanged himself at his government residence early on Saturday.

Police have recovered two suicide notes, but none of them specify the reason for suicide barring that he was under stress.

Sources claim the reason apparently was office politics which he also shared with his colleagues, though seniors claimed they have not found anything in this regard.

According to preliminary investigation, neighbours broke open Bishnoi’s door after he did not come out of his house till late on Saturday morning.

Churu SP Tejaswini Gautam said, “The officer went home after work around 3am on Saturday and hung himself. We found two suicide notes. While one was addressed to his parents asking them to look after his wife and two children, the other one said he was under stress and no one is to be blamed for his death.”

Bishnoi was liked by his seniors and colleagues. He was credited with improving the condition of several police stations, claimed officials. He stayed alone in Churu while his family resided in Suratgarh.

As soon as the news of his death spread, people gathered to protest outside the police station demanding an inquiry into the matter.

A WhatsApp message started doing the rounds following Bishnoi’s death in which he had apparently written to his friend claiming that he was stuck in ‘internal politics’ at his workplace. “Bishnoi was a very good officer and was stressed due to some issue at office which he had written to his friend about. The matter needs to be thoroughly investigated”, said a colleague on the condition of anonymity.

DGP Bhupendra Singh has ordered CID-CB inquiry into the suicide and a team was sent to Churu to investigate the case. “Our team has already reached Churu and will investigate all aspects of the case including the reason that the deceased officer was stressed about,” B L Soni, ADG, CID-CB, told TOI. Meanwhile the deceased cop’s family refused to take his body and demanded a CBI enquiry into the death.

CM Ashok Gehlot and deputy CM Sachin Pilot condoled Bishnoi’s death on social media.

While the duo from Boloor are relatives of P-536, the district’s fourth patient who succumbed to Covid-19, the trio from Kasba are relatives of P-390, the first person to succumb to Covid-19 in the district on April 19.The patients designated P-658 and P-675 are the son-in-law and daughter of P-536, respectively. Incidentally, P-579, the husband of P-536, and her grand-daughter (P-674) were discharged earlier this week. The family was infected by the novel coronavirus after they took care of an ailing P-536 who suffered from TB meningitis. The patient had undergone treatment at First Neuro Hospital in Padil, which was the epicentre of a cluster outbreak, and a declared a supervised isolation centre.The patients designated P-777, P-778 and P-779 from Kasba village were also discharged, and they are all primary or secondary contacts of P-390. Residing in the same neighbourhood as P-390, the trio are all contacts of P-578, who is related to P-390. In a relief to people from Kasba village, deputy commissioner Sindhu B Rupesh on Friday partially modified the containment zone, shrinking the area, after people there protested their total and forced isolation from ther rest of the world since April 19.Dakshina Kannada district recorded three positive Covid-19 cases on Saturday, including that of P-1783, who committed suicide at a quarantine centre at Moodbidri on Thursday. He tested positive for the disease after his suicide. Others to test positive are P-1810, a 41-year-old woman who was diagnosed with an influenza-like Illness. The other person who tested positive is a 30-year-old man (P-1811), who returned from Maharashtra.In neighbouring Udupi, while a 34-year woman (P-1931), who returned from Maharashtra, tested positive for Covid-19, the authorities have initiated contact tracing to find the source of infection of two other men – one aged 40 and another aged 49—who were designated P-1940 and P-1941, respectively, in the state bulletin. With this, while Dakshina Kannada district is left with 34 active cases, Udupi which was one a declared green zone, has 49 active cases.Quarantine facilities stretched to limitsUdupi deputy commissioner G Jagadeesha said lack of local testing facilities has stretched the district’s quarantine facilities to their limits, as Udupi has received around 8,010 people from various states, who have been placed under institutional quarantine. As per a government directive, swab samples must be taken twice in 14 days and tested, and only then can the returnees be sent home, if they test negative. However, non-availability of laboratories has prolonged their quarantine period, he said.To date, 3,600 swab samples have been sent to Yenepoya Medical College at Deralakatte, SIMS, Shivamogga and Wenlock Hospital in Mangaluru. Recently, KMC Manipal too has started to test samples. Within 15 days, equipment worth Rs 2 crore will be brought to the district hospital to set up a testing lab, he said.

178,['24/05/2020'],"Industrial activity picks up, labour shortage a hurdle","Nagpur: Industrial activity is gradually picking up in Vidarbha but many units are facing shortage of skilled labour due to the exodus of their workers. With the central government starting regular trains for migrant workers, more skilled staffers are going home.

Madhusudan Rungta, president of MIDC Industries’ Association, Chandrapur, said that only 50% sponge iron units were running in the city because of shortage of skilled workers. “Most of the workers who operate the furnace and make steel billets are from outside the state. Many of them have gone home and are not in a mood to return. We are trying our best to persuade them. The government should give them incentives to return to work,” he told TOI.

The industrialist further said that textile, construction and power sectors were also facing problems as 30% of their workforce had left.

Suresh Rathi, president of Vidarbha Industries’ Association (VIA), said that between 50% and 60% industries had started functioning in the region. “All export-oriented units (EOU) are working. However, most of us are facing labour shortage. We have replaced unskilled migrant workers with local ones but it will take a long time to train locals in skilled work. We have urged the Nagpur collector to train locals in ITIs, polytechnic, etc to do skilled industrial work so that this problem does not arise in the future,” said Rathi.

While the government was providing 20% additional working capital without hassles, many industrialists are in a dilemma whether to take loans because they may not get orders later and would have to pay back loans. “The state government should waive off fixed charges of MSEDCL for the lockdown period. We will have to pay three months’ charges at one go and this is a big worry for us,” added Rathi.

Nitin Lonkar, president of Butibori Manufacturers’ Association (BMA), said that most of the workers in Butibori were locals but those living in Wardha district were unable to join work due to ban on inter-district travel. “About 75% to 80% factories have started operations. We mostly supply to the power, mining and cement sectors and hence we are facing order problems,” he added.

Chandrashekhar Shegaonkar, president of MIDC Industries’ Association, Hingna, said that most of the workers were from Nagpur district and hence labour shortage was not much of a problem. “Some employees are unable to get travel passes. Industries are working at 30% to 40% capacity as there are no fresh orders. We are completing the orders received before lockdown. The government should give us 50% of working capital as 20% is insufficient,” said Shegaonkar.

Rajkumar Bilala, president of Akola Industries’ Association, said that as most of the industries were food processing ones, they were not shut down. “However, we are facing labour shortage as workers have gone back to Madhya Pradesh,” he said.

CHENNAI: Looks like the railways’ converting several sleeper class coaches into isolation wards for suspected Covid-19 cases was a misplaced plan. With no takers for the train isolation wards, railways has started to turn them back into coaches. The move comes as there is a huge demand for running shramik special trains to move guest workers and Southern Railway is also considering to run trains within Tamil Nadu, excluding Chennai.

Work has begun at railway yards. Railway Board has instructed the zone to remove all fancy taps, mosquito nets, dustbins, plastic curtains, fire extinguishers, buckets, mugs and stools added to bathrooms, said an official. Middle berths that were removed to make space in coupes for patients will be reinstalled. The coaches that will be restored will be used to run around 10 trains for guest workers.

Southern Railway spent several lakhs of rupees and converted around 500 sleeper class coaches into isolation wards, which was the highest target given to a zone by the railway board. The work was completed during the lockdown in record time. Railway staff worked almost round the clock at yards and maintenance workshops for the project. Middle berths were removed, two toilets of a coach were converted into bathing rooms with expensive fixtures after sealing the Indian commode with floor panels, plastic curtains were installed in the bays, provision was made to install ventilators in each coupe.

In Chennai division alone, 50 coaches were converted into isolation wards at an approximate cost of Rs 20 lakh. Though railways publicized the initiative and also requested the government to use them, the state government did not come forward to do so.

Southern Railway too was hesitant to use the coaches to house passengers from Delhi, who arrived by Rajdhani Express on May 16, after the state government sent a letter to the ministry saying railways should quarantine the passengers till tests can be done. A senior railway official said, “Only coaches that are needed to run trains will be converted for trains. The ministry has now said there will be 2,600 special services for guest workers. Two to three trains depart almost every day from MGR Central as shramik specials.”

The railway ministry has also said the coaches can be changed back to isolation coaches if there is a need in the future.

182,['24/05/2020'],World turtle day: Forest authorities begin turtle conservation in Pilibhit,"Pilibhit: On wold turtle day, Pilibhit forest authorities have begun the conservation of various species of turtles in the district, which has a sizable population of turtle — the presence of important species and their biodiversity— in Uttar Pradesh after the Chambal region.

The conservation plan envisages identification of turtle habitats, their documentation and enforcement of conservation strategies. According to studies and surveys conducted by notable institutes such as Turtle Survival Alliance (TSA), out of the total 15 species of turtles found in UP, Pilibhit is home of as many as 13 species.

According to Shailendra Singh, India program director at TSA, a US-based international organisation, the world is saturated with as many as 356 species of turtles, of which 29 are found in different parts of India.

“Pilibhit has been given special precedence as 13 species are found here, of which seven species, including the Indian softshell turtle, Indian hill turtle, peacock softshell turtle and painted roofed turtle, have been enlisted in Schedule - I of the Indian Wildlife Act. Unfortunately, all these species have at present been categorised as endangered,” said Singh.

Singh further said, “The conservation of turtles in India is an inevitable need as certain species like spotted pond turtle, three-striped roofed turtle and yellow tortoise, which had once remarkable presence in Indian with no immediate risk to their existence, has now been entered the ‘Red-list’ of France-based the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) in just 10 years.”

“On world turtle day, the TSA has evolved a concept called ‘keeping common species common’, encapsulating the inherent meaning of enforcing heedful conservation strategies far before the wild species reach the edge of endangered status.”

Singh divulged that Pilibhit-Kheri region was among the five most sensitive regions that had been identified by the Wildlife Crime Control Bureau (WCCB) the previous year from the viewpoint of turtle trading.

Pilibhit Tiger Reserve field director H Rajamohan said that he had recently been provided with over 1,000 wetlands in Pilibhit by the Wetland Authority of UP. “In coordination with the district administration, we will soon begin the identification of turtle habitats in these wetlands. In the next phase, a comprehensive list of identified wetlands will be sent to the state forest department for inclusion in the official records.”

“We will lay our focus primarily on Mala and Khannaut rivers, Sharda Sagar dam and Phulhar lake, which have identified wetlands with an abundance of important species of turtles,” he said.

“We will coordinate with TSA for expert guidance, technical support and capacity building of official workforce as well as with local stakeholders as the need to comprehend the conservation of turtle species as a challenge was felt,” added Rajamohan.

NEW DELHI: Delhi government on Saturday suspended an officer of the Directorate of Civil Defence headquarters after an advertisement disrespecting the territorial integrity of the union of India triggered a controversy. The advertisement was issued for enrolment of volunteers for civil defence corps where one of the eligibility criteria was that the person should be a “citizen of India or a subject of Sikkim or of Bhutan or of Nepal and a resident of Delhi.”Over it, the chief secretary of Sikkim wrote a letter to the Delhi chief secretary stating that the advertisement is immensely hurtful to the people of Sikkim who take pride in being the citizens of our great country.

185,['24/05/2020'],Chennai: Malls may not be as cool when they reopen for business,"Wearing masks will be a must inside malls and centralised ACs will be tuned to curb spread of Covid-19

CHENNAI: For 31-year-old Durgesh Haridas, summers has always been about beating Chennai’s heat in the air-conditioned malls. Once the lockdown ends, however, he may think twice before entering them as malls will be completely different in the post-Covid world and air-conditioning may not be their strongest attraction.

Closed for around two months now, companies running malls have chalked out a detailed strategy for physical distancing, disinfection, use of air-conditioners. When malls in the city reopen after the government gives a green signal, you can’t enter them without a mask or if the thermal CCTV cameras sense an abnormally higher body temperature. Fewer people can use elevators, while one many have to queue up outside retail stores ensuring physical distancing.

Mall owners realise that the centralised air-conditioning is a unique selling proposition bringing in visitors, not all shop. “This is why we have hired a HVAC (heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning) consultant to guide us. 70-80% of the air will be fresh,” said Pooja Patti, centre director of Phoenix Marketcity, which also owns the Palladium mall. The AC will be disinfected and air ducts sanitised once every two hours, she says.

The centre head of VR Chennai also stressed that frequency of cleaning of ACs would be increased and an average temperature recommended for combating the spread of virus would be maintained.

Suresh Singaravelu, executive director at Prestige group which owns the Forum mall, says patrons would have to download Arogya Setu app, which has a self-declaration for not having Covid-19, apart from thermal screening at entry points. “We plan to regulate entry based on footfalls,” he said. Tables at the food courts will be spaced out, which would in essence reduce capacity, Suresh said. Apparel stores would be encouraged to avoid use of trial rooms; in case they are used, the clothes would have to be steamed and used only two days later, he said.

Despite all the publicity, there seems to be no signs of the lab functioning.

A four-member panel of experts had visited the GMC and other Covid-19 care centres two weeks ago. They, too, instructed the GMC authorities to acquire the necessary equipment and start the laboratory immediately.

District collector M D Singh said that although funds have been transferred to the account of the Hauffkin Institute of Pune , the latter is delaying the delivery of the equipment by saying it is yet to arrive from Singapore.

A participating dean asked how, when such disruptions could take place in Delhi, students in villages and small towns could cope with online exams . Not surprisingly, 12 of the 16 deans voiced opposition to such an assessment system. A month later, Vinay Gupta, dean of examinations, issued circulars that DU would hold online open-book examinations (OBE).Not surprisingly, 12 of the 16 deans voiced opposition to such an assessment system. A month later, Vinay Gupta, dean of examinations, issued circulars that DU would hold online open-book examinations (OBE).The deans’ initial resistance to OBE has since grown into a bigger opposition. Recently, 15 heads of department expressed opposition, even as probably for the first time since the four-year undergraduate programme protests of 2013, DU’s teachers’ and students’ unions are on the same page in resisting OBE.The task force on examinations constituted by the university decided that 2.5 lakh final year undergraduate and postgraduate students of regular and distance learning institutions would have to sit for OBE. A dean who was at the April 13 meeting disclosed, “DU was to have waited for the UGC panel report on the matter, but a committee was formed with mostly representatives from the School of Open Learning. Then on May 13, a circular was issued on online exams, completely disregarding the administrative, technological and other practical problems as also the concerns of students.”The biggest worry is access to computers/laptops and reliable internet connectivity to be able to download question sheets and then scan and upload the answer scripts. Online access to reading materials is also a big problem. Online class attendance hasn’t been encouraging either. A St Stephen’s College teacher said, “Many of my students from the Northeast and parts of UP couldn’t attend online classes even once. They weren’t able to download reading materials due to connectivity problems.”As a solution, DU asked teachers to upload reading materials on its website. But as an HOD revealed, “On one occasion, when teachers tried to do just that, the website crashed. And everyone knows about the glitches in our portal during the annual admission process.”Rajesh Jha, member, Executive Council , asked, “How will you ensure the student is writing the exam? There is no invigilation for OBE.” However, alternatives such as calculating marks with 25% internal assessment or the average of the marks secured by the student in the previous semesters have been discarded. A taskforce committee member argued, “A student will be at a loss if exams were not held. Calculating averages will mean most students will have a similar range of marks.”As for Net accessibility, the panel member said DU was conferring with the Union electronics and information technology ministry. “At its district centres, the students will be provided with the facilities required to write the exams,” he said.But departmental heads — the people responsible for executing the exam process — have resolved the examinations will be held in offline mode in July. Their letter to the dean of examinations said, “In addition to students’ concerns, this imposed OBE has operational difficulties for HoDs, including preparing three sets of question papers for each subject, moderation of nearly a thousand question papers and uploading of question papers.”One of the HODs has also raised a legal question. “The exam process is part of the contract between the student and university and syllabus is the contract document. Syllabi undergo change through several processes in the statutory bodies before becoming a part of DU’s statute,” the head pointed out. “In that document, exam is defined as an offline three-hour, written test. Changes in this have to go through the same statutory process.”",delhi,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-75934920,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1412995,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/obe-answer-to-exam-question-says-du/articleshow/75927154.cms
190,['24/05/2020'],Northeast Delhi riots: Two Pinjra Tod activists arrested,"Image used for representational purpose only

NEW DELHI: Two women activists from Pinjra Tod have been arrested for their alleged involvement in the anti-CAA protests and subsequent violence that erupted in northeast Delhi in February.

Natasha Narwal and Devangna Kalita along with their associates, including Jamia students Safoora Zargar and Meeran Haider, had allegedly led a group comprising scores of women to protest at the Jafrabad metro station. They had then blocked the Maujpur Road from February 21 onwards, said police.

“As pressure mounted to vacate Shaheen Bagh, these accused and their associates planned to create a parallel gathering to coincide with the visit of the US president,” added police.

Police sources told TOI that Narwal and Kalita were arrested from a south Delhi area by the northeast district police after their roles were established during the interrogation of other members of the group .

Recently, RJD leader and Jamia student Meeran Haider and activists Safoora Zargar, Gulfisha, Asif Tanha and Safiur Rehman were arrested too which was opposed by many people.

The activists of Pinjra Tod were under the scanner for a month after police found their role in the events preceding the riots.

Police claim that the two accused women along with others had also incited a mob to launch an attack when the riots broke out. They were captured in a mobile footage .

Narwal, who had pursued an MA in Philosophy from Delhi University, is now working full-time with the activist group. Police said that she had led the women’s march at Jafrabad in the morning of February 23, when the initial violence took place. She had then allegedly called several others to join the protest, they claimed.

Kalita, also a former DU student, works with an NGO and joins the group during the protests.

The two women and their associates are suspected to have mobilised at least 50-60 people who were later involved in the riots, said sources. Police have seized the mobile phone of both the activists and are scanning through their social media accounts to establish whether they were in touch with the miscreants who had later joined the arson.

Police have identified a few more of their associates who will be soon questioned regarding their role in the riots.

“Police did not give reasons to their family members for their arrest. Many students and activists have been arrested by Delhi Police in the last couple of months. We strongly condemn the witchhunt of activists and students being carried out by the state,” said a statement from Pinjra Tod.

Of the 47 ponds to be restored at Rs 103 crore cost, work has begun in 21 locations. Road restoration and stormwater drain construction has also begun in six zones.

Under the smart city project, the corporation has started preparing detailed project report for the integrated transport management project, smart parking system and river restoration projects. Other World Bank-funded projects will be also be taken up, said an engineer.

“Under the Tamil Nadu Urban Road Infrastructure Fund, work on 674 bus route roads were to be taken up of which 164 had been completed. Work on 96 roads were ongoing, that will begin now,” said L Nandakumar, chief engineer. 4.4km stormwater drain work across several prime roads will begin.

NEW DELHI: In Jharkhand’s Chatra, Vivek Agarwal managed to sit through just five of the 25-odd online classes on contemporary economics conducted by Delhi University’s Satyawati College. It took 20 hours for St Stephen’s student Hamzah Mattoo to transfer a 3MB file as part of his April assignment from Srinagar, Kashmir.

Sri Aurobindo (Evening) College student Rajesh Kumar has to climb to the roof of his house in Laxmangarh village in Sikar, Rajasthan, even to use his phone. All students of Delhi University, their struggles with phone and internet connectivity are examples of how the university’s open-book, online semester exams could prove a huge problem for those in a similar predicament.

Close to 60% of DU’s students are in their hometowns, having left after the semester ended in March. With the opening of educational institutions unlikely soon, the university proposes to test its students through end-semester open-book examinations (OBE). There has been much protests against on social media, ironic given that for many students coming on social media to express concern is only a distant possibility.

Internet connectivity is the backbone of the successful conduct of any online examination. Saima Bhat, a 3rd year BA(H) student at Kalindi College, left Delhi for Kashmir when the lockdown was announced. “We though it would be a short break and didn’t carry textbooks, and now there’s news of online exams,” worried Bhat. “We have no access to 4G connectivity, only 2G after the revocation of Article 370. How can we download PDF files? We have to submit practicals and assignments. It’s so uncertain here, and phone services are suspended immediately whenever something happens.”

Her state mate Mattoo, a fourth semester BA Programme student, said, “I tried twice to connect on Zoom app for online classes but couldn’t. Anything over 5MB fails to download. Sitting for online exams won’t be possible. It’s not just the speed, both data and voice services have snapped three times in the last 15 days.”

Kumar’s anxiety may not be about mobile telephony suspension. “I am taking your call from the rooftop because the network is unavailable inside the house,” he shouted into this correspondent’s phone. The son of a labourer and first-year student doesn’t know what OBE entails. “I hope my college conducts the exams whenever it opens,” is all he can say.

Shashank Shekhar Gautam too left behind his books while returning home to Balia in UP near the Nepal border. The 2nd year economics (H) student of Satyawati College said, “For those financially underprivileged, the online system is not fair.” Agarwal adds that even evaluating students on internal assessments or previous exams is “unfair because of fluctuations in performances”.

With confusion about OBE all around, a Manipuri student of Hindu College said, “When DU finalises its plan, I hope it’ll keep in mind the most underserved students on its rolls.”

200,['24/05/2020'],Small biz owners close ranks for revival,"Coimbatore: Small business owners in the district have taken to Instagram to promote each other and revive the sagging businesses.

Earlier this week, Instagram had announced a new feature - Support Small Business sticker - to help small businesses that were hit by lockdown.

It allows one to promote a business by adding a story to the story feed with the Support Small Business sticker, ensuring more visibility.

And the most trending Instagram hashtag in the district in the past one week was #smallbusinesses, which small business owners use to promote other small businesses, sometimes their direct competitors.

Some of the first to catch up with the trend were well-known and popular bakers. Deepa Pathmanathan of Sweet Sprinkles, who gave a shout-out to some of the talented bakers she came across in the district and Chennai, was one of them.

Aarudhra Giri of Café Gluttony says, “The link to my café’s page was shared a few times, but this initiative goes beyond just linking people to other small businesses. We truly want all our competitors to survive the crisis as well. In fact, now I link many of my customers to other businesses in my field for the orders that I can’t deliver.”

A few business operators say the hashtag is motivating. According to them, it improves visibility and results in increased response. “While I may have 2,000 followers, when I tag six other local brands in my story and they reshare my post to thank me, I automatically increase viewership to my post. Even if some followers are common, thousands of new eyeballs are grabbed by supporting each other. It leads to more inquiries and response, which is much needed at times like this,” says Mirudhula Bharath of lil Amore, Baby and Kids Goods.

Others say the initiative has opened many of them to local vendors, who they did not initially know about. They comprise local cocoa powder producers, vanilla essence makers and seasoning makers, etc. Saranya Balu, a dessert baker who has a page called The Happy Jar, says “I am considering a local brand of cocoa powder like Indian Natives, instead of the international brands that I usually use. I have also replaced a Kerala-based vanilla extract maker brand with a Pollachi-based brand.”

The lockdown has made many people turn to local producers as a lifestyle choice, outside their businesses. Food scientist Srijanani Prasad says, “The support for local goes beyond our businesses too. When online platforms couldn’t ship during lockdown, we ended up trying many local body care brands like Vilvah and Bee Little. I am considering a local dressmaking brand too. They are as good as multi-national, corporate brands. Maybe more expensive, but they are more exclusive.”

201,['24/05/2020'],"Covid-19: 22 cases daily in Mumbai police, tally nears 900","MUMBAI: In the last 40 days, almost 900 city cops, including 137 officers, have tested positive for Covid-19, with 12 succumbing to the disease. On an average, 22 cops have tested positive daily since April 20, with the first death (of a head constable) occurring on April 25. The youngest cop to die was an assistant inspector aged 32 years. Till now, 136 of the 898 infected personnel, including 23 officers, have recovered.Mumbai’s police strength is 41,115, including 3,500 in traffic division. Senior officers say there are mainly two reasons why over 2% of them have been infected: bandobast duty in slums, which account for a disproportionate number of the city’s Covid-19 case load, and the fact that it’s difficult to perform police duties for long hours in PPE. The infection rate among those on duty is much higher than 2%, though, as many of the 41,115 cops are above 55 and are on leave because given their age, they are at increased risk of Covid-19.“The majority of those who tested positive were deployed in slum pockets, including those in Dongri, Kurla, Wadala and Bhendi Bazar,” said a police officer.The virus hasn’t spared any police department or region, whether it’s area police, crime branch, EOW, motor department, special branch, traffic or protection branch. The highest number of infected cops are from armed police, 196, followed by 157 from the central region (Worli, Parel, Byculla, Dadar, Kurla, Dharavi), 135 from west (Bandra, Andheri, Powai, Vile Parle, BKC), 135 from south (Colaba to Pydhonie), 65 from east (Mulund to Ghatkopar, Chembur to Trombay), and 45 from north (Dahisar, Borivli, Gorai, Goregaon, Kandivli). The worst-affected police stations are JJ Marg (46 cases), Sahar (28), Oshiwara (12), Wadala TT (8) and Vakola (6). In all 3,935 cops, including 366 officers, were placed in quarantine at isolation centres as of May 22, with the maximum from the armed police (1,237).A serving IPS officer told TOI that cops are exposed to the virus while dealing with different kinds of people. “They do not know who is a carrier and who is not. That’s not possible to know. Duty in slum pockets is not the only thing to blame. There are multiple factors, like the places where constables live and hygiene conditions in their surroundings,” he said. “The route a cop takes to reach the workplace also matters as does whether he or she uses a sanitizer on duty or washes hands frequently. The virus can be contracted through any means. We do not know who all are infected.”A senior officer said all the city cops who died of Covid-19 had comorbidities -- underlying health issues like diabetes and hypertension.Joint commissioner of police (administration) Naval Bajaj said the police are collecting details and trends to scientifically investigate how cops are contracting the virus. Mumbai police spokesperson DCP Pranaya Ashok said, “Each cop has been asked to take HCQ tablets, besides vitamins. Safety gear has been provided to all. Health details are collected daily.”Former state DGP Pravin Dixit said that instead of using batons and other repressive means for implementing the lockdown, the police should develop contacts with NGOs, social workers, local politicians, NCC cadets and community leaders to assist them in maintaining order. “This will help cops maintain social distancing themselves while they perform their duty,” he said.",mumbai,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-75931491,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-207810,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/22-cases-daily-in-mum-police-tally-nears-900/articleshow/75929015.cms

JAIPUR: Chief minister Ashok Gehlot said that an additional amount of Rs 114 crore was borne by the state government for the distribution of free wheat during the lockdown period . Wheat offtake from Food Corporation of India was tripled compared to normal during this period.

Gehlot said that during the period of lockdown, dry ration and cooked food items were distributed to 3.7 crore helpless and needy people in the state through district administration. Migrants and other special category people who are not included in the list of food security scheme will be given 5kg wheat per person free for the next two months. He directed to prepare a database by conducting survey so that wheat could be distributed to them through fair price shops.

The chief minister said that the names of ineligible people in the National Food Security Scheme (NFSA) list should be removed and names of those genuinely entitled should be included. The number of people associated with NFSA in urban areas, especially in Jaipur, is very low, so the names of eligible people should be surveyed in urban areas.

He said that the Department of Food and Civil Supplies and the Department of Medicine and Health should take to task adulterants and black marketers. He also stressed on the up-gradation of POS machines to solve the problem of not getting network and taking long time for biometric verification. Gehlot appreciated the innovations adopted by the Department of Food and Civil Supplies and the distribution of door-to-door ration materials through fair price shopkeepers during Covid-19 pandemic.

The district Childline operator has rescued the baby girl, who will be taken care of at the government hospital in Tirupur for the next couple of days.

Chinnaswamy, Childline operator in Tirupur, said a man had called him up around 6am saying an abandoned newborn was found at Periyar Colony. According to the caller, he said, the baby was tightly wrapped in a white cloth and placed in a box near a dustbin in that area.

“I rushed to the spot, where I was joined by the Anupurapalayam police, who took the baby to a nearby private hospital. Doctors said the baby was delivered just a couple of hours ago. They got a new mother to feed the baby girl, after which she was kept in incubator for three hours,” he said.

Meanwhile, district child protection officials arrived at the hospital and the baby girl was shifted to the government hospital in Tirupur, where she is likely to be kept for 7 to 10 days to ensure she is free of any infections and is completely healthy. From the hospital, the baby will be moved to an orphanage for adoption.

In the list announced on Tuesday, for the year 2019-20, six cities were rated 5 star, 65 cities 3 star and 70 cities 1 star. More than 1,400 cities applied for the star rating , according to an official release.

No metropolitan city in the country features in the list. Among the southern states, only Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh have cities featuring in the list — Mysuru, Tirupati, Vishakapatnam, Vijayawada.

The low number of certifications signifies the rigorous and robust certification protocol, the official release added.

There is no clarity whether corporations and municipalities in Tamil Nadu applied for the star rating as neither the officials in Chennai Corporation nor the commissionerate of municipal administration (CMA) responded to queries about the star rating. The state has 15 corporations and 121 municipalities and 48% of the total population live in urban areas, according to the municipal administration and water supply department.

The star rating protocol was launched by the ministry in January 2018 to institutionalize a mechanism for cities to achieve garbage-free status, and to motivate cities to achieve higher degrees of cleanliness, the release added.

“The importance of sanitation and effective solid waste management has been brought to the forefront now due to the Covid-19 crisis,” said Hardeep S Puri, minister of state (in-charge).

According to the protocol devised by the ministry, each ward in every city must achieve a certain standard across 24 different components of solid waste management (SWM), including components such as cleanliness of drains and water bodies, plastic waste management, managing construction and demolition waste and is graded based on overall marks received.

205,['24/05/2020'],Hyderabad: 3am tweet seeking help moves businessman,"Representative image

HYDERABAD: Businessman Rajendar Agarwal became somebody’s 3am friend even though he did not know them at all.

Agarwal got up at 3.10 am on Saturday and in a little while noticed a tweet. The request moved him. He woke up his wife Neelam and they rushed to a hotel in Madhapur to help two pregnant women who needed financial assistance to hire a room for their quarantine on their return from Dubai.

“It was a god-given opportunity to help them,” Agarwal told STOI. “We were just being human,” he said.

Agarwal happened to read a tweet by social worker Amjed Ullah Khan that 10 passengers who arrived from Dubai were taken to a hotel on their arrival from the Rajiv Gandhi International Airport but had no money to pay for the hotel stay. Among the passengers were women. Agarwal cleared the hotel stay bill of the two pregnant women. “The hotel allowed them to use their common facilities, served dinner and tea before I went. Later, they shifted them to a room while I was still there,” Agarwal said.

Amjed Ullah Khan said Agarwal reached the hotel at 4am and paid Rs 22,500 towards the hotel bill. “This is real Ganga-Jamuni tehzeeb of Telangana,” he said thanking Agarwal for helping the two Muslim women.

Amjed Ullah Khan said many passengers had arrived on Friday from Dubai and among them 10 had been taken to a hotel in Gachibowli . Two persons who were out of job since the last four months and affected due to lockdown are unable to pay Rs 15,000 being charged by the Telangana government for quarantine, he said.

“They are not being allowed a room since Friday night and made to wait at the lobby. Someone kindly reach them as they need Rs 30,000 for two single rooms,” Amjed Ullah Khan had tweeted at 3 am.

The joint family of Agarwal staying near Peddamma Temple at Jubilee Hills has been providing home-cooked meals to 10 homeless people since the lockdown near their house.

207,['24/05/2020'],Time robbed: Institutionalised children pine to return home,"CHENNAI: It’s been a tough period for kids in child care institutions across the city. They usually return to their families during April-May, but have remained cooped up in the homes since March 24 when the lockdown began.

Most of the children in such institutions have come to get an education and better upbringing.

“I want to go see my mother ,” says a 12-year-old girl who speaks to the older woman in Tirunelveli over phone every alternate day.

The authorities agree children do get overwhelmed, especially when they speak to their parents over the phone. “We keep talking to them and explain the situation. It is a hard time for us all,” says Maya Gaitonde, general secretary and trustee of Balamandir Kamaraj trust.

Joseph Leo, director of Don Bosco Anbu Illam, says they try to keep the children busy with various activities. “But there is only so much we can do. They still miss their parents.”

However, since the lockdown relaxations were relaxed, a few parents on the city’s outskirts have been allowed to take their children home .

There are more than 87,000 children in 1,600 homes across TN, the state with the most children’s homes. Most children in such homes are from dysfunctional families or have single parents.

At the Madras Christian Council for Social Work, a few parents took their children home. For those left behind, says director Isabel Richardson, a plan was chalked out. “We started holding activities and competitions like cooking, painting, baking and dance. The children are now honing their creative potential and are fine.”

Every week, district child protection units have been holding video conferences with children at every home in TN. “They are anxious and want to know more about the crisis. Regular interactions have been helping a lot,” an official said.

While heritage activists criticise officials for pulling down the symbol of the Vizianagaram rajahs, municipal authorities have justified their action by saying that it will help ease traffic congestion.

Leaders of opposition parties staged protest on Saturday. Main opposition Telugu Desam alleged that the landmark was demolished to erase the memory and contribution of the royal family of Gajapathirajus.

TDP president Nara Chandrababu Naidu tweeted that the pulling down of the monument was a “deliberate effort” to erase the contributions of the forefathers of former Union minister P Ashok Gajapati to the region. He said “petty politics must never take precedence over history”.

Officials said the demolition was necessitated for beautification of the locality.

Vizianagaram municipal commissioner SS Varma told TOI that the structure was not demolished. “As part of the renovation works, it was removed and three lanterns and lions are safe and a new pillar would be constructed soon.”

211,['24/05/2020'],"Returnees in villages seek jobs, farming inexperience an issue","NAGPUR: If industries are likely to face shortage of workers due to the reverse migration following lockdown, villages are teeming with returnees who may start looking for employment in the coming days.

A large number of persons living in villages, especially those in western Vidarbha, have been working in cities like Mumbai and Pune. According to estimates, around 80,000 have returned to districts of Western Vidarbha alone.

Back home, they now add to the workforce available in the rural areas. With sowing to begin next month, farmers have already begun preparing for the kharif season.

Farmers and farm activists say majority of the returnees have no experience of farming even if their families own land.

“Such persons may not be very useful as farm hands while their return may impact the overall economy of villages. Working in the cities they used to send money home which in turn was used in agriculture by their families. Now source of funds is not there,” said Vijay Jawandhia , a veteran farm activist from Wardha.

According to Jawandhia, the government should compensate for their loss of wages in the cities. “If the returnees work in their own farms too, it should be covered under MNREGA and paid wages,” he said .

Kishore Tiwari, chairman of Vasantrao Naik Shetkari Swavalamban Mission (VNSSM), the state government task force on farm crisis, said that these persons cannot work as farm labourers but will still need jobs. The government will have to come up with measures to provide them employment during their stay in the villages.

Farmers across the region TOI spoke to said that though preparations have begun, sowing will only begin after rains. A large number of persons who have come back are still under quarantine and the need to employ them will only arise once they are out, said the farmers.

Samadhan Supekar from Isoli village in Buldhana district said the concern can be felt. “The boys who had gone out are not used to farming and they cannot return to the cities either. However, there is hardly any work in the villages.” Buldhana has seen large number of migration from villages due to series of droughts.

Some pockets in the rural areas have also seen migration of farm hands. Vijay Ingle of Chitalwadi village in Akola said the area had a number of farm workers from neighbouring Madhya Pradesh who are now leaving due to Covid scare. “The workers are lining up to get fitness certificates and are leaving for their home state,” he said.

Tiwari said certain crops are grown with the help of workers from Telangana who have returned to their states. “The Telangana and Andhra Pradesh farmers who took up farms in Maharashtra on rent have also fled,” he said.

CHENNAI: After a record-high sea surface temperature observed in some pockets of Bay of Bengal triggered a change in the atmosphere and gave strength to cyclone Amphan that wreaked havoc in coastal Orissa and West Bengal, it is now posing threat to coral reefs, one of the most vulnerable marine ecosystem, near Tamil Nadu coast .

An underwater survey conducted by researchers from National Centre for Coastal Research (NCCR) found that nearly 85% of the corals in Gulf of Mannar bleached between mid-April to mid-May after the sea surface temperatures touched a record 34Rs C. The bleaching was observed both in the natural habitat as well as restoration area in Manoli Islands, where polyps are planted on small concrete slabs. A few days before Amphan formed, a few weather buoys in the south and north Bay of Bengal recorded sea surface temperatures of 32-34Rs C . According to climatologists, one of the reasons behind the high seas surface temperatures in Bay of Bengal, observed probably for the first time ever, was due to global warming.

“The bleaching was observed up to 5m depth while those in 10m depth were not affected. We saw a similar bleaching event last year, but the temperatures were not this high, and bleaching was observed only in the month of May. This time, we saw 43% bleaching in April and it increased in May,” said an NCCR scientist involved in the survey. “In the 2019 event, corals recovered in August 2019 when the temperatures dropped. This time we have to wait and see,” he added.

Gulf of Mannar is home to 128 species like acropora and porites that were mapped through remote sensing by NCCR scientists between 2002 and 2005. The study team, which also mapped coral species in other locations in the Indian regions including Gulf of Kutch, Lakshadweep and Andaman and Nicobar Islands, is planning to survey their health status through another study. “We may soon conduct a survey in Lakshadweep,” a scientist said.

Several factors like change in chemical composition, temperatures and carbon dioxide can affect corals. When the sea surface temperature rises, corals expel zooxanthellae, an algae that gives corals its colour, and turn white (bleaching). While corals survive such bleaching events, they die when they are exposed to extreme stress for a long time.

In Gulf of Mannar, unlike the global bleaching events recorded in 2016 and 2017 that resulted in 16% mortality of corals, NCCR scientists said the present event is due to a local phenomenon.

Climate scientist Roxy Mathew Koll from Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology, Pune said Bay of Bengal has been warming over the last several years and is contributing to the drastic intensification of cyclones developing over the region as well as posing threat to the already vulnerable coral reef ecosystem. “Bay of Bengal has been rapidly and monotonously warming in the last several years and it is part of the global warming trend,” he said.

JAIPUR: In a heinous crime, a 10-year-old mentally challenged girl was raped and murdered by her brother and his three friends in Manoharpur police station area on the outskirts of Jaipur. The girl had gone missing on May 17 and her body was found on May 21 following which the four accused were arrested on Saturday.

“On May 18, the girl’s parents registered a complaint that she had gone missing and we started a search. The girl was mentally challenged and could not even speak or do routine tasks on her own,” ACP Sulesh Choudhary, investigating officer of the case, told TOI. The cops registered a case and started investigation. The cope were clueless for three days as no one had seen the girl after she went missing around 4pm on May 17.

“For three days, we kept looking for the girl and hundreds of cops were deployed in the area to find her. The family was also not giving us any straight answers but instead were contradicting themselves. We searched for her in the forest area as well thinking that perhaps the family killed and buried her there,” Shankar Dutt Sharma , SP, Jaipur Rural , said. After three days, the girl’s family came to the cops with the clothes which she had worn at the time she went missing and claimed that they found them in the forest area. “The family themselves brought the clothes and FSL teams were deployed. Finally, we found the child’s body which had been dumped in the forest,” added the SP. Using call records of the likely suspects, cops zeroed in on the four accused including the victim’s brother who confessed to the crime.

“The girl’s brother and his three friends took her to the secluded area probably to kill her but they used the opportunity to rape her. All four accused raped her following which she was strangled to death. The accused even purchased new clothes for the child the day she was kidnapped.”

One of the rooms of the Lakadganj police station was converted into a makeshift sampling station.

It’s learnt that around 872 cops from different units, including the SRPF, deployed at containment zones , would be tested in the coming days. Around 35 cops from city police and 28 SRPF personnel are now in quarantine. Senior inspector of Shanti Nagar police station is also home quarantined.

The top brass of the city police decided to go ahead with the testing of samples of their personnel in the backdrop of two of their constables and six SRPF personnel turning positive while serving in the Mominpura containment zone. “Chances of several cops, including a few officers, being detected as asymptomatic carriers are high,” said a police personnel. He welcomed the testing.

A few days ago, city police and NMC had jointly filed a petition to go ahead with the testing their personnel who are at the forefront of the fight against Covid-19. Though NMC decided otherwise, city police wanted to go ahead with their earlier plans of testing their cops, especially the ones deployed in containment zones from where their first two positive cases were reported.

CP BK Upadhyay said the testing cannot be deferred for the betterment of the force and welfare of their families. “We already have eight men positives. There is a need to find out if there are any more positives among our personnel and isolate them so that their families are saved,” said the CP.

“We have been engaged in every possible high risk job and standing round the clock at containment zones which further make us susceptible,” he said.

It’s also learnt that the city police have earmarked Tehsil police station and another NMC clinic in Mominpura for conducting the testing.

Under chief medical officer, Dr Sandeep Shinde, the city police hospital has already geared up with a 16-bedded isolation facility. Around 20 ventilators would be provided by the Indian medical association (IMA) to the city police hospital, said Dr Shinde. Another four private hospitals have been roped in with ventilator facility which would treat Covid-19 patients from city police. “Homeopathic and allopathy booster dosages have been repeatedly given to the police personnel and we are screening them every day both at the police station and also at the place of deployment,” he said.

KOTA: At least 1,03,014 people have so far got work under Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act ( MNREGA ) at 737 work sites in 182 gram panchyats of Bundi district since April 20.

It is the highest number of employment of people in rural areas of the district under MNREGA in the last 10 years, chief executive officer of Bundi zilla parishad Murlidhar Pratihar said.

Since the lockdown which had shattered the economic condition of families in rural areas, employment under MNREGA is rendering financial backup to families in rural areas, Pratihar said.

Pratihar said on an average, not less than 560 labourers in each of the 182 gram panchyats are being provided work under MNREGA while number of families demanding work is still rising. He added speedy steps with regular review of demand of work were underway to provide jobs to remaining families.

Reports for payment to labourers have been sent to banks within 8 days of completion of fortnight mustroll, the CEO said and added on the basis of requirement of work in gram panchayats, approvals for new projects as per the rules were being issued to provide work for 100 days to every job card holder.

219,['24/05/2020'],"Delhi: Thrown out by landlord, boy reunited with family after a month","Yogita who feeds strays spotted Vishal in a Dwarka park

NEW DELHI: Two women in two states, conscientious police officers and social media helped a 13-year-old boy reunite with his family two months after he was thrown out of the house by his landlord in Dwarka . The boy, Vishal, met his parents in Patna on Saturday morning.

“My son looks famished and is continually sleeping. Our landlord was demanding rent and we told him we would pay him when we returned to Delhi. But after a tiff between our children, he turned Vishal out of the house,” said Santosh Pathak, the boy’s father. The parents disclosed how the homeless boy was found sleeping in the park by a woman who feeds stray canines.

The Pathaks left the boy behind with his elder siblings, Prakash (20) and Divya (18), when they travelled to their village in Bihar on March 15 to arrange for their daughter’s wedding. “I was to return in a few days, but got stuck in Bihar due to the lockdown,” said Santosh. “My children called me to tell me the landlord had thrown Vishal out of the house and they couldn’t find him. I think he did it to force us to pay the rent for April.”

Divya suffers from gall bladder stones and forgets occasionally to take her medicines. “In March last week, Prakash scolded me for not taking my medicines and also slapped Vishal, who started crying. The landlord came and asked Vishal not to make a racket,” narrated Divya. “On April 2, he ordered Vishal out of the house. We called the cops, but to no avail.”

A month later, on May 2, a woman identified as Yogita Kumari , who regularly feeds the area’s stray dogs, saw Vishal asleep in a park in Sector 7, Dwarka . Kumari said, “He told me he was thrown out of the house and initially stayed in an abandoned toilet. When an ‘uncle’ tried to force his pants open, he ran away and started staying at the park. From that day, I started giving him food. Then finally, on May 20 Sneha responded to my story and said she wanted to help the boy.”

Sneha, who works with a private firm in Rajasthan but is currently in Uttar Pradesh, told TOI said when she saw Kumari’s story on Vishal on Instagram, she wanted to help him. “Somehow we found the phone number of the boy’s father and I tagged IPS officer Arun Bothra and @indiacares_2020 on my Twitter post. They responded,” added Sneha.

Bothra, who is posted in Odisha, contacted his batchmate in Patna. Sanjay Kumar, IG, SSB, then contacted the parents in the Samastipur village. Kumar said “The family hadn’t spoken to Vishal for over two months. We arranged for a ticket and also sent a car for them to pick up their son. The parents’ happiness on meeting their son on Saturday morning was all we ever wanted to see.”

Kumar and Bothra run an online platform, @indiacares_2020, to help people trapped by the coronavirus lockdown. “We have officers and volunteers in different parts of India willingly serving people,” Kumar added.

221,['24/05/2020'],"Maharashtra government allowed trains, but says no to domestic flights","TimesView The state government’s decision not to allow flights defies logic. Lakhs and lakhs of migrants have been allowed to travel by bus and train — and rightly so. Flying is far less trying. Airports—and Sahar compares with the best in the world—are more organised. There are fewer passengers than at train and bus stations, and there is greater access control and security. Also, exposure to fellow passengers is limited to a few short hours: A Mumbai-to-Kolkata flight, for instance, takes less than a tenth of the time of a train journey between the two cities, and there’s no need to have food on board. Not just that—if operations remain suspended, airlines might find it difficult to continue supporting the wage bills of their Mumbai staff. The government needs to reconsider its decision. This is the business capital of India. It needs to get back to business.

MUMBAI: Despite the Centre making it clear that domestic flights across the country would resume from Monday, the Maharashtra government , for all practical purposes, refused any flight in the state from May 25 due to the Covid-19 lockdown, saying it will only consider emergency or transit flights.The refusal is likely to hit thousands of passengers who have booked tickets on the 1,400-odd domestic departures and arrivals scheduled in the last seven days of May to and from Mumbai, Pune, Aurangabad and Nagpur. A state bureaucrat told TOI on Saturday that since the MMR region , Pune and Aurangabad were red zones, it would not be advisable to allow flights until there is normalcy. An airline official said in that case, airlines will have to carry out major rescheduling of operations as several flights are routed via Mumbai, India’s 2nd busiest airport.“We have informed MIAL, which controls Mumbai airport, that unless it fine tunes airport operations, it will not be allowed to initiate domestic flights from Maharashtra from May 25. We will allow flights of purely emergent nature, for international transfer passengers, medical emergencies, students and for cases on compassionate grounds,” the bureaucrat said.We have informed MIAL, which controls Mumbai airport, that unless it finetunes airport operations, it will not be allowed to initiate domestic flights from Maharashtra from May 25. We will allow flights of purely emergent nature, for international transfer passengers, medical emergencies, students and for cases on compassionate grounds,” the bureaucrat said.The state’s nodal officer Saurabh Vijay sent a letter to the civil aviation secretary on Saturday in this regard. “It is not clear,” he stated, “whether MIAL has worked out requirement of staff including ground staff, technical and non-technical, their availability, health conditions/check-up for their fitness level to resume work at airport and daily commute. It is also not clear from which part of the city they will commute and whether it falls in containment zone, which have (sic) total restrictions on movement.”The letter further stated, “You say 27,500 passengers are expected to commute daily from May 25, but besides this load, there will be a large number of airport and airline staff, their commuting will be a big challenge as public transport and private taxis are off and to start normally at such short notice without proper planning will disrupt lockdown restrictions and passengers will be put to severe inconvenience, besides disrupting the state machinery’s fight against the epidemic.”Responding to the government’s stand, an aviation industry official said that MIAL (Mumbai International Airport Ltd) was ready to handle domestic flights. “It is the state government’s responsibility to see that passengers are able to reach the airport to board flights and those who land are able to reach their destinations in the city,” the official said.Mumbai and other red zones in Maharashtra have stringent restrictions in place even in lockdown 4.0 though the Centre has allowed relaxations in this fourth phase even in the red zones.In his letter, Saurabh Vijay also requested the civil aviation secretary to plan daily operations in detail and furnish information to the state government on the issues raised by it. He also stated that while making requests, “please bear in mind that the local authorities and resources are very much strained due to the existing Covid-19 situation.” “The state government will provide you all possible assistance for smooth start of these operations in a phased manner,” he added.",mumbai,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-75931595,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-247759,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maha-govt-allowed-trains-but-says-no-to-domestic-flts/articleshow/75929019.cms

NAGPUR: Seven people including a 50-year-old beggar tested positive for Covid-19 in the district on Saturday, taking the total number of cases to 417. Cases have come from six different localities.

There was some tension at Pandhrabodi when a large number of people gathered demanding denotification of the containment zone.

IGGMCH deputy medical superintendent Dr Sagar Pande told TOI that the beggar was suffering from distension of abdomen and was at Gandhi Putla area in Itwari. He was brought to the hospital by the police. “He was not clean and was breathless. Medical officer Dr Ranveer Yadav cleaned him up, started treatment and also collected swab samples which tested positive,” said Pande.

NMC additional chief medical officer Dr Praveen Gantawar said this cannot be seen as “community spread”. “He was in Satranjipura containment zone for a long time and might have contracted the virus there,” he said.

Earlier too a couple of beggars had tested positive but they were from NMC’s night shelter home in Mominpura containment zone.

A 24-year-old pregnant woman from Habib Nagar, Teka Naka in North Nagpur , came for a routine check up as she had completed 8 months, and tested positive.

The efforts of Nagpur Rural district health officer Dr Dipak Selokar and additional DHO Asim Inamdar led to the detection of two positive patients in Kamptee and Dahegaon (Saoner tehsil).

The team had taken swab samples of 72 persons who returned from Mumbai to Kamptee and asked them to remain in home quarantine. All but a 24-year-old man tested positive.

Similarly, a 25-year-old of Dahegaon returned from Mumbai on May 17 and developed symptoms at home. He rushed to IGGMCH and tested positive.

A father (52) and son (25) from Butibori tested positive at AIIMS. The son had returned from Mumbai.

The total number of cases from Nagpur Rural increased to 7.

A 22-year-old pregnant woman, who was travelling from Mumbai to Kolkata, was admitted at GMCH for delivery and tested positive.

A large number of people gathered on the road at Pandhrabodi demanding denotification of containment zone. The police at the barricade seemed unable to disperse them. West Nagpur MLA Vikas Thakre reached the spot and called NMC officials.

According to Thakre, the NMC had assured people that containment zone, notified on May 7, would be withdrawn on May 22. “After a positive person died on May 11, there have been no more cases from Pandhrabodi. I have lodged a complaint with CM Uddhav Thackeray ,” he said.

NMC official said that as per norms “an area continues to be in containment zone for 28 days after discharge or death of patient”.

12 corona positive patients from IGGMCH were discharged taking the total number to 332. 11 were from Mominpura containment zone and one from Satranjipura.

HYDERABAD: Around 1,400 acres of land will soon be acquired by the Telangana State Industrial Infrastructure Corporation (TSIIC) and Ranga Reddy administration for turning the district into a hub for food processing industries (FPI).

With the Telangana government being keen on establishing special economic zones (SEZ) for food processing units, officials have said that a plan to acquire land in four villages in Ranga Reddy district Rs Sidhapur (330 acres), Khanapur (365 acres), Tallapalliguda (473 acres) and Kothapally (246 acres) Rs is in making.

According to officials, the acquisition process will be completed at the earliest.

At a review meeting with ministers, district collectors, corporation chairmen, chairmen of Rythu Bandhu Samitis, agricultural officials and agri-scientists earlier this week, chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao directed collectors to identify the land for establishment of SEZs soon.

The CM has directed that at least 600 acres to 1,000 acres should be acquired to develop SEZ, according to officials. Since the area required is big, the government has said that the lands idensitifed for industrial purpose by TSIIC can also be utilised.

“The collectors have been asked to give preference to government land and assigned land under Protection of Tenants (POT) and lands should be free from litigation,” a senior official of the revenue department said.

Chief Commissioner of Land Administration (CCLA) and chief secretary,in his order, said the land allotted in the existing industrial parks, now unutilized, should be used for the SEZs. Asking the collectors to consult with the local public representatives, the chief secretary said no survey of persons on the land parcel should be done at this stage.

HYDERABAD: The National Investigation Agency ( NIA ) on Saturday arrested a man from Hyderabad and his wife in connection with a 2019 human trafficking case .

NIA officials in a press note said that 47-year-old Justin alias Abdul Salam and his wife Shivuli Khatoon, 29, were arrested and three women were rescued. Officials discovered that Khatoon allegedly entered the country illegally in 2012 from Bangladesh.

“Searches were conducted at Justin house and incriminating documents have been recovered,’’ an NIA official said. Three women who were rescued from the house were found to have been illegally trafficked into India, a few months ago from Bangladesh, for sexual exploitation. It was also learnt that Khatoon played a key role in the trafficking of women.

NIA in 2019 had arrested three Bangladeshi nationals- Mohammed Yousuf Khan, Bithi Begum and Sojib Shaik besides one Indian national, Ruhul Amin Dhalli in the same case. The investigators had already filed a chargesheet against them in March, 2020. This case was first registered in Chatrinaka police station and was later taken over by NIA.

While aviation industry sources say that the metro routes — to Mumbai, Delhi, Kolkata and even Pune — are likely to see maximum rush, they add that the overall footfall will be low. Reasons: limited airline operations coupled with apprehension among travellers to travel in an aircraft.“Those flying in the initial days are primarily those who have been stranded in Hyderabad over the last two months and want to return home. They are either those who came here on work and got caught , orworkers, in IT and other sectors,” said a industry insider.Among them is Ashish Rai who is set to travel right on Day 1— May 25. “I haven’t seen my family for months now. So, the first opportunity I got, I booked my tickets,” Rai told STOI.According to the Directorate General of Civil Aviation’s (DGCA) summer schedule, the Rajiv Gandhi International Airport will operate about 164 daily connections between May and August, as opposed to its usual domestic load of 480 flights.But given that a large section of travellers are still in the wait-and-watch mode — before they can book their tickets — tour operators in the city are yet to start work. On Saturday, most of them confirmed that they aren’t taking any bookings yet. “We will wait for a while before resuming bookings.

The nine bodies, all of them of workers employed at a local gunny bag manufacturing unit, had been retrieved from a borewell in Gorrekunta, over a period of 48 hours. While four of them belonged to one family originally from West Bengal — Maqsood, his wife Nisha, daughter Bushra and her three-year-old son — the others, identified as Shabaz Alam, Sohail Alam, Shakeel, Sham, Sriram, belonged to Bihar and Tripura.

With leads from forensic analysis being inconclusive, investigators are now analysing the call data records (CDR) of the deceased. Among other probabilities, cops are also trying to ascertain if someone had pushed the victims into the well . Speaking to STOI local police sources said two people, both natives of Bihar, had been taken into custody for questioning. Police are still trying to conclude the cause of the suspicious deaths.

“In the primary investigation, we found that they died of drowning. There were scratch marks on some of the bodies. How they occurred, is still being investigated. Among the nine bodies, we suspect that seven were alive when they fell into the well while two others were either sleeping or already dead when they were thrown into the well,” said Dr Raza Malik who performed the post-mortem examination. The scratch marks are suspected to have been caused due to dragging of the bodies or injuries suffered while falling into the well.

Dr Malik said that they were yet to conclude the cause of death and were waiting for Forensic Science Laboratory (FSL) to perform some tests before reaching any conclusions. Since most of the bodies were in a decomposed state, forensic experts found it difficult to draw conclusions. The doctors, through FSL, want to find out if there was any poison in the liver or viscera to ascertain if there was any foul play.

Meanwhile, based on CDR data, police found that Maqsood had called Shakeel to the gunny manufacturing unit on Thursday night. This was confirmed by Shakeel’s wife.

228,['24/05/2020'],"Rajasthan: Judges, lawyers turn tech-savvy for virtual hearings","Picture for representational purpose only.

JAIPUR: While Covid-19 has urged many to change their working style, it has made others enhance their technical knowhow about internet, video calling and video conferencing. The judges , magistrates and lawyers in Rajasthan are a prime example.

Since the lockdown till May 15, the Rajasthan High Court has heard 5,227 cases via video conferencing while the district courts across the state heard at least 16,000 cases!

Petitioners who had negligible knowledge of video calling, updated their knowledge so they could be heard clear by the courts where their litigations and cases were pending.

“It was of course an enriching experience where you have to address and make your submission before the court through video calling. I believe unlike a usual court set-up here you have to be specific and to the point,” said Anoop Dhand, a lawyer at Rajasthan High Court.

He said that addressing the court through video calling has been a learning experience.

“This has also taught us to be precise and concise and emphasize on the points which we want to bring to the notice of the court rather than beating around the bush,” he added.

Likewise, Rampratap Saini, another lawyer at the Rajasthan High Court keeps his laptop and mobile phone ready and equipped with good speed internet at the time of case hearing.

“You can’t cut a sorry figure in front of the court. Thus, you need to be ready with all your gadgets at the time when your matter comes for hearing. It was really a great and unforgettable learning experience for me and many lawyers across the state,” he added.

The government lawyers who approached Rajasthan High Court and district courts across the state have a similar story to tell.

“Initially, it was a little awkward, however, gradually I started liking it. Also, I felt it was no different from a usual court proceeding,” said a lawyer from Jhunjhunu on the condition of anonymity.

According to the data available with the courts, nearly 15,820 cases were heard by the district courts across the state. “Pali heard the maximum cases in the state, i.e., 84 from March 23 to March 31, 512 in April and 400 till May 15,” said an official.

229,['24/05/2020'],Kerala: Curious case of ‘missing children’,"Representative image

THIRUVANATHAPURAM: Posing serious questions about the functioning of orphanages , a state government audit has revealed that the actual number of children who are permanent residents in these institutions is not even one-tenth of the figure submitted by them to obtain government grants .

Making things worse, there are several orphanages that receive grants but are not registered under the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015. As per a Supreme Court order , registration under the JJ Act is mandatory for obtaining government grants.

The number of children residing in as many as 307 institutions functioning under the orphanage control board — that received a financial assistance of Rs 12.53 crore in 2019-20 — was verified during the second week of May by officials of the women and child development department . It was found that these institutions, that had claimed to have 16,720 children till about two months ago, had in reality only 1,333 children as permanent residents. In fact, it was found that more than 50% of institutions, some of which even claimed to have 1,000-plus residents, did not even have a single child. The government provides a grant of Rs 1,100 per child per month to such institutions. The grant is released for the maintenance and protection of each child and is sanctioned on the report filed by district social justice officer after inspecting the register maintained by orphanages.

In Malappuram alone, there are 55 such institutions that together claimed to have as many as 6,296 children in them. But during the verification, the actual number was found to be just 29 children. Also, 10 of these institutions were not registered under the Juvenile Justice Act.

There are as many as 826 orphanages under the orphanage control board in the state, out of which only 307 receive grants from the government. Of these, only 272 are registered under the Act. “As per a Supreme Court judgment, children’s homes should be registered under the Act. The court had even directed high courts to ensure their registration,” said Biju Prabhakar, secretary, social justice and women and child development.

According to top government sources, when the JJ Act specifically says that institutional care for a child should be the last resort after three other choices, the preferential order being the child allowed to reside with biological parents, adoption and foster care. Government sources said such homes, many of which are run by religious organizations, are not only violating the SC order, but also fudging the numbers to obtain grants from the government.

BENGALURU: Chaos prevailed outside the Tripura Vasini gate of Palace Grounds on Saturday after more than 6,000 migrant workers, including women and children — mainly from Odisha — gathered to board a Shramik Special train to Puri with a seating capacity of only 1,600.

Many arrived as early as 2am hoping to complete the paperwork in time. Police personnel struggled to control the migrants, who queued up for hours without food or water.

Many Odisha natives who thronged Ballari Road had received an SMS on Friday night reading: ‘One train going from Bengaluru to Puri. You are requested to come to gate number 2 of Palace Grounds on Saturday at 9am.’

Vivekandand Rao, from Balangir, said: “I received the text at 8.30pm on Friday. I was waiting for it as I had registered online to leave a few weeks ago. I packed my bags and reached Palace Grounds at 8am on Saturday and was stunned to see hundreds already waiting there,” said Rao, a construction worker who had already vacated his rented room.

By 2pm, the situation turned uncontrollable with many migrants pressing against the Tripura Vasini gate demanding police let them in. Many, including senior citizens, women and children, were seen clinging to their heavy bags under the scorching sun. “We cant leave the line or else we will be pushed to the end,” said Dilip Kumar, who was in accompanied by his wife Janibhai and daughter Palki.

As the number of migrants started to swell, authorities used the public addressing system to control the desperate crowd. Volunteer Prasanth Patnayak tried to convince the migrants in Odiya but the crowd remained restless.

Police personnel on the ground said some persons who had received the SMS had possibly forwarded it to other Odisha migrants, which resulting in the mass gathering. “I lost my job as a cook at an eatery in Koramangala and have been struggling for more than 50 days without food. This is my last chance to go back home to my loved ones,” said Sanjai Das from Puri.

Confusion prevailed among police personnel too. On-duty personnel changed the gate for migrant entry from 2 to 7 after hundreds had waited for hours. Some like Mohammed Fayez who came to the spot as early as 3am was forced to the tailend of the queue due to the changes. “We are being treated worse than animals. We are forced to wait here for hours with no official addressing our concerns,” rued Fayez.

HYDERABAD: After municipal administration minister KT Rama Rao tweeted to pollution control board officials, apprising them of Raa Cheruvu in Boduppal, the situation seems to have turned from bad to worse. KTR ’s tweet followed an article in TOI about the sorry state of the water body .

On Saturday, water seeping into the lake turned yellow. “The water seemed fine till yesterday. Today when we went there to do some work to restore the lake, we saw a bright yellow colour water. This is quite disappointing,” Veeramallu , who has been fighting for the lake for over four years, said on Saturday.

Venkat Chary, another resident of the Boduppal area, said, “Despite KTR’s tweet nothing has changed. After his reaction, a slew of people came to this area. But what is use of their work when there is no effluent treatment plant for the industries nearby? First the water should be treated, only then any beautification work matters.”

Pollution control board officials said that they had inspected the lake and would convene a meeting with nearby industries once the lockdown ends. Asking people to be patient, one source said on condition of anonymity that notices have already been sent to 73 industries.

HYDERABAD: A civil court in Ranga Reddy district has posted to May 28 a case pertaining to copyrights tussle over the upcoming Hindi movie Jhund that allegedly revolves around the lives of two individuals. They are Akhilesh Prakash Paul, a goon turned football player who went on to become the captain of the Indian team in the World Slum Soccer World Cup in 2010, and Vijay Barse, a football coach at Nagpur in Maharashtra.

The petition was filed by Nandi Chinni Kumar, a filmmaker from Hyderabad, stating that he entered into an agreement with Akhilesh Paul to make a biopic on his life story. But contrary to this agreement, a Hindi film was made ready on the same subject. He was urging the court to stall the release of this film which is all set to be released soon through OTT and also through theatres. He said that he also registered his story with Telangana film writers association with a title Slum Soccer. The Hindi filmmakers too filed pleas before the same court not to pass any orders in this case without first hearing them.

When the court gave them notices, they told the court that their film is about Vijay Barse and not about Akhilesh Paul. The role of Vijay Barse is played by Bollywood superstar Amitabh Bacchan. Vijay Barse encouraged slum children to play football instead of falling prey to bad habits. He is also the founder of Slum Soccer Foundation.

Akhilesh too was his product. The protagonist in our film is Vijay Barse and Super Cassettes Industries Private Limited (T-Series) is producing the film, the T series firm said in its affidavit filed before court opposing any injunction or stay on the release.

Stating that the Hindi filmmakers are twisting things, Chinni Kumar says that he was inspired after coming to know about the story of Akhilesh in a TV show Satyameva Jayathe anchored by Bollywood hero Aamir Khan who introduced Akhilesh to the world through this show. He was Nagpur slum boy addicted to bad habits and it was his love for football that saved him. He was an accused in 45 criminal cases and he is now helping the slum children to lead dignified lives through football, he said. Even Akhilesh entered into an agreement with me, but now everyone is turning against me, he said.

Scared residents of the society, meanwhile, dialled cops and the forest department for help.But not quite enjoying its stay in the locked house, the leopard decided to venture further and reached the Mandava Road.

The crescent for Shawwal, the 10th month of Islamic Hijri calendar, was not sighted anywhere in Telangana and Andhra Pradesh on Saturday and thus Sunday will be the 30th day of Ramzan.

Moulana Mufti Khaleel Ahmad, vice-chancellor of leading Islamic deemed university, Jamia Nizamia, said Id-ul-Fitr will be celebrated on Monday as none of the state-level official moon-sighting committees across India has confirmed the sighting of the crescent on Saturday.

“The sky was clear in many parts of the country. But nowhere the crescent was sighted,” Mufti Khaleel, who is also a member of the official moon-sighting panel for Deccan region, told media. Id prayers will not be held in congregation, he said urging Muslims to offer thanksgiving Namaz at home.

With the lockdown hitting the livelihood of millions of people, Ramzan 2020 has been a subdued personal affair for Muslims as many decided to celebrate the Id on a low key.

Islamic scholars have called upon the community not to buy clothes and other accessories for the Id and donate the money to the poor and migrant labour.

Ramzan has always been a mega affair both in spiritual and temporal terms in Hyderabad. Right from the day Hyderabad was founded by Mohammad Quli Qutub Shah V in 1591, Ramzan and Id have been the integral part of the Deccani Tehzeeb (tradition) with the Charminar and its vicinity coming to life. For the first time in about a century the aura of Ramzan is missing thanks to Covid-19.

240,['24/05/2020'],SOP 3.0 unlikely to give a fillip to domestic flyers,"Mangaluru: The standard operating procedure (SOP) 3.0 for entry of persons from other states into Karnataka is unlikely to see a mad rush of people, including business travellers , queue up for domestic air travel resuming on Monday.

The catch lies in sections 4 – a, b and c of the SOP that the commissionerate of health and family welfare and Ayush services released late on Friday. It mandates a total of 14-days of institutional and home quarantine and different set of rules for business travellers.

While home/institutional quarantine applies for people returning from high prevalence states that the state government has notified including via road/rail/air with home quarantine for pregnant women, children below 10, senior citizens above 80 and terminally ill, others for low prevalence states need to undergo 14 days of home quarantine. Businessmen coming for urgent work too have a lot of leg work to do under section c of the new SOP.

For starters, they need to bring a negative test report of Covid-19 from an ICMR approved lab and it should not be more than two-days prior to the date of travel. If they don’t have the certificate, they must undergo Covid-19 test and stay in paid institutional quarantine till the results come. After the results is negative, they can finish their work and return. If their stay is beyond five days, they must go to a fever clinic and get themselves examined.

An auto extension of another five days is granted if found asymptomatic. S Suresh Kumar, nodal minister for Covid-19 briefing in Karnataka, said SOP 3.0 was reframed after deliberations at the highest level involving the chief minister. “The specific needs of business travellers who are used to jet setting between cities across states was taken in to consideration,” he said, adding it could be further refined based on their needs.

TV Mohandas Pai, chairman, Manipal Global Education said the Centre must come up with a common methodology to facilitate travel and not leave it to states. “Hardeep Puri, Piyush Goyal and Nithin Gadkari must facilitate framing of this methodology, failing which there will be chaos and people stranded on arrival at their destination,” Pai told STOI.

“There is also need for adequate testing centres failing which people will not be able to get around,” he added.

Pradeep G Pai, a city-based businessman said, “While the SOP is fine as far as air-travel within the state is concerned, it is a tad cumbersome for inter-state air travel, especially with the quarantine part.”

VV Rao, airport director, Mangaluru International Airport said he has shared the SOP with airlines and requested them to ensure their patrons are clear about sections 4 a-c of the new SOP to avoid last minute confusions.

They attributed the situation to lack of commuters in the absence of proper public transport and the state’s rule restricting the number of passengers per trip to just one.

Auto driver union representatives said only 60% autorickshaws was on roads in the district on Saturday. The rest are being repaired and most probably would start operations on Monday. There are around 13,000 autorickshaws in the city limits and another 2,000 in rural areas.

P K Sugumaran, president, Coimbatore Federation of all Autorickshaw Workers’ Union, said, “We will see more rides only if the ‘one person per ride’ rule is relaxed. At least, two people should be allowed per ride. Usually, people would want to travel in autos only as families or in groups.”

M Nagaraj, an auto driver, said he managed to get only one ride that too to a hospital. “Because of the state rule we lost a few rides that otherwise we could have got. People hesitate to take an auto just for a person. If two people are allowed, we could ensure a distance of around 2ft between them inside the vehicle. Moreover, we have kept sanitisers in our vehicles and most people wear masks.”

Nagaraj said almost none of the 150 auto drivers on their WhatsApp group had found any rides. Disappointed, many of them left for homes by noon.

D Shobinath, an auto driver from Perianaickenpalayam, said things weren’t any different for him either. “I went around areas such as Veerapandi Pirivu, Perianaickenpalayam and Thudiyalur, but didn’t manage to get any ride. Only if bus services resume, there would be movement of people, who would take auto rides.”

Drivers said before lockdown they used to earn Rs 600-Rs 700 a day, of which Rs 200 would be spent on diesel. But on Saturday, they had to return home empty-handed with an extra expenditure on fuel. Some drivers said they had borrowed money from relatives to meet family expenditure for the past two months.

The union has sought the state to allow them to ferry at least two passengers per ride and a compensation of Rs 15,000 towards their livelihood disruption due to lockdown.

BAREILLY: Samajwadi Party (SP) MLA from Moradabad Ikram Qureshi was booked for “assembling a large crowd at his residence for ration distribution and violating social distancing norms amid Covid-19 lockdown in a hotspot”. Police have lodged an FIR against him and his son Ubaid on Saturday.

The SP MLA, however, said that every year on the last Friday of Ramzan he distributes food among the poor and he was only following the tradition.

Additional superintendent of police (city) Amit Anand said that an FIR under sections 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant), 269 (negligent act likely to spread infection of disease dangerous to life), 270 (malignant act likely to spread infection of disease dangerous to life) of IPC and relevant sections of the Epidemic Diseases Act and Disaster Management Act was lodged against the MLA and his son.

“Further action will be taken,” the police officer said, adding that while distributing ration, they were not using face masks.

The FIR had been lodged on the basis of a complaint filed by a sub-inspector in which he stated that he was, along with his team, on lockdown duty when around 2:30 pm he found that scores of people, including women, had come out on to the streets from Asalatpur and Eidgah localities.

“The people said that they were going to the MLA’s house where food was being provided. I immediately informed the police station for additional force to control the crowd. The MLA didn’t respond whether he had taken permission from the district administration,” a copy of the complaint stated.

When asked, despite being a lawmaker, why he wasn’t aware of the lockdown norms, the MLA said, “What can I do if people assemble in such large numbers? I have been feeding the poor every Ramzan.”

HYDERABAD: A person cannot walk into a primary health centre (PHC) without a mask and sanitising his/her hands on entering the premises is mandatory, according to a new set of guidelines issued by the state health department for containing Covid-19 post the lockdown.

Not allowing spitting in public places, including PHC premises, regularly disinfecting thermometer, BP machine and stethoscope as well as mandatory sanitising of hands by PHC staff and doctors after coming in contact with a patient are among other mandatory measures issued in the order on Saturday, detailing the post lockdown strategy across Telangana.

It also stressed on the need for co-ordinated efforts of various departments to control the spread in urban areas and GHMC limits.

Also, surveillance would be continued in all erstwhile containment zones and all hospitals, both private and government, have been mandated to report cases of severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) cases to the ‘ebirth and notifiable diseases portal’.

“All SARI cases should be tested for Covid-19,” it said.

At PHCs, the order mandates, disinfection of all surfaces should be done at least twice a day with 1% sodium hypochlorite.

Ambulances transporting suspected Covid-19 patients should be disinfected after every visit. Biomedical waste management should be done scrupulously with specific focus on disposal of protective gear, it added.

For surveillance, ASHA workers and ANMs have been asked to monitor fever and influenza like illness (ILI) cases at field level and medical officers have to alert district health officers in the instance of a spurt in the number of cases.

“Migrant workers have to stay in mandatory home quarantine for 14 days and will be followed by ANM and ASHA workers. In case of symptoms, they have to be tested,” the order said.

BAREILLY: A man in his thirties allegedly strangulated his 52-year-old father after the latter denied him money for liquor. The accused, identified as Vicky, managed to escape after hiding his father’s body in a box. The incident came to light only after victim Mahendra Singh’s wife opened the box on Saturday to find her husband’s body hidden there. The incident took place at Kundanpur village under Majhola police station limits in Moradabad .

According to police, when on Saturday afternoon a shocked Bhagwati Devi started screaming on discovering her husband’s body in a box, family members and neighbours rushed to the spot. They immediately informed the police.

Additional superintendent of police Amit Anand said, “Mahendra Singh and his two sons – Vicky and Bunty – were vegetable vendors. Singh’s wife said that Bunty had gone to sell vegetables on Friday morning when their elder son Vicky got into a scuffle with his father over money for purchasing liquor.

The reverse migration continues even as several special trains and buses are being run across states by governments to ferry them home during the Covid-19 lockdown. Many of them have even died in recent road accidents and hunger.

On Friday evening, BJP MLA Roshanlal Verma stopped one such truck with around 50 migrants hiding under a tarpaulin - all of them on their way to eastern UP from Punjab. Each of them had paid around Rs 3,000 to the driver for the journey.

“It is disheartening to see poor labourers bearing such enormous pain in scorching heat without food and spending huge amount of money. Honestly, I am on the road since lockdown, feeding the people. The migrants are still returning home, many hiding in trucks and even travelling on foot despite government's initiative to start trains and buses. This is a failure on the part of the officials who are not following the instructions given by our honourable CM Yogi Adityanath,"" the MLA said at Tilhar area in Shahjahanpur.

""Around 50 migrants were found hiding in a truck battling scorching heat and hunger. I offered them food and water at Tilhar and even offered them a bus, but they requested us to let them go by the same truck as they had already paid a huge amount to book the truck. The police failed to check the truck at the district border and administrative officials failed to provide them food and water during the course of their journey,"" the MLA added.

""People will hold government responsible if something happens to any one of them. I will raise this issue in front of our CM,” the MLA further said.

Most of these migrant labourers were from Deoria, Ballia and Basti districts. Munaga Lal, one of the migrants said, “We were living in Punjab for the past 10 years and we were hopeful that the Covid lockdown will be over and factories will start operating. But, recently our contractor asked us to return home as there is no hope of renewal of work for the next few months. The factory owner doesn’t have any orders for shoes and sporting goods. So, we were left with no other option, but to return home. The virus is also spreading fast.”

Local administrative and police officials refused to make any comment on the migrants still travelling on trucks.

HYDERABAD: A day before domestic air travel resumes across airports in India, passengers travelling to Hyderabad are still clueless about the quarantine protocol they need to follow, once they touchdown at the Rajiv Gandhi International Airport (RGIA).A tweet put out by TOI on Saturday morning — to connect with passengers taking a flight on May 25 — saw scores of readers ask only one question: Will we need to be quarantined once we reach Hyderabad?Asked Sanjay Bajaj: “Any idea about Telangana norms related to quarantine for domestic Travellers. I'm trying to find out but no response from any resource.” Another flyer, Kuriseti Sudhir tagged @RGIAHyd and @TelanganaCMO seeking clarity on the same issue. “Dear Sir, Can you please clear the air on the quarantine norms in the state of Telangana for the passengers travelling from 25th May through domestic flights?” he wrote.The lack of clarity, many said, is what’s holding them back from booking their tickets. They appealed to the authorities to at least confirm if they have to undergo institutional quarantine — like Karnataka which has announced that passengers from six states will be sent for a mandatory seven-day institutional quarantine — or can be quarantined at home.“Could you please share what is the state protocol for passengers arriving in Telangana via domestic flights?

The trains are expected to reach their destinations in two days.

A Southern Railway official said an Assam-bound special train, which originates from Thiruvananthapuram in Kerala, would stop at the city railway station around 4am on Sunday to take more than 100 guest workers home from the district.

The official said the number of coaches in trains has been increased to 26 from 24 to ferry more number of guest workers home.

A total of 25 special trains have left the city so far, carrying more than 30,000 guest workers to their home states of Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Odisha, Jharkhand, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and West Bengal, the official said.

While industries have resumed operations at several places, most of the workers are in no mood to stay back and are packing their bags to go home. A district administration official said they were returning home as industries have not started utilizing 100% manpower. “Most of the workers are willing to come back once normalcy returns.”

Meanwhile, nine special trains were operated from Tirupur district to ferry guest workers back to their respective states. However, there wasn’t any train service from that district in the past couple of days.

Coimbatore MP P R Natarajan, who was in Tirupur on Saturday, urged the state and district administration to take steps to send guest workers back home in trains without causing them any hassles.

Explaining that the guest workers had worked hard for the development of the district, he said their works should not be downplayed by not extending them a helping hand.

Speaking to reporters at the CPM office there, he said after Chennai, Coimbatore and the dollar city had the most number of guest workers in the state. “There should be transparent measures to send them back home. Workers, who have already registered online, have been walking to railway stations in groups every other day, only to be sent back by police. To avoid this, train timings should be announced in advance and help desks should be set up.”

As textile units can employ only 50% workers, jobless guest workers are still waiting to go home. The state and district administration should ensure that they get food, essentials and assistance fund, he said.

Pointing out that industrial units have been paying workers only 70% of their salary, he said employers were using the crisis to undermine workers’ rights and benefits. “As a part of this, the BJP-ruled states are trying to amend labour laws. While industries represent their issues to the government, they should also ensure to pay the workers in full.”

He said micro, small and medium enterprises were affected by lockdown and that they should be given interest-free bank loans through simple procedures along with a year’s holiday period.

“Coronavirus outbreak has led to the unprecedented enforcement of lockdown throughout the country. The concept of Work From Home (WFH), which was until now was mostly synonymous with the IT industry, has become a household term. With organizations asking employees to WFH, videoconferencing has become an integral part of daily life. The national policy on Software Products-2019 has also a vision to drive the rise of India as a software product nation, to make India a global player in the development, production, and supply of innovative and efficient software products. In the light of these developments, the ministry announced an Innovation Challenge for development of a videoconferencing solution under the Make in India initiative,” a ministry statement said.

Techgentsia, set up in Kochi in 2009, had also played a significant role in managing the control room activities during the 2018 floods. Isaac wrote in his FB post: “Techgentsia is not a mere start-up company. This company has proved its social responsibility through various activities. It is voluntarily acting as the IT backbone of all the local development projects’ in Alappuzha assembly constituency. The company developed software for Alappuzha during the flood in a short period and it also spearheaded the activities of the Alappuzha control room. They also played a pivotal role in school digitalization projects.”

VIJAYAWADA: The YSRC celebrated its first anniversary of its electoral victory on Saturday.

The YSRC claimed that in the last one year, chief minister YS Jaganmohan Reddy has fulfilled all his poll promises. The flagship ‘Navaratnalu’, the roap map for welfare measures, have been implemented.

YSRC general secretary and advisor to the government on public affairs, Sajjala Ramakrishna Reddy said unlike previous governments, all the welfare schemes as promised in the manifesto have been delivered in the first year itself. The chief minister with his vision has ensured that all the benefits are delivered to the people at their doorstep.

He achieved it with the help of the village and ward secretariat system and network of volunteers.

Ramakrishna Reddy said policy decisions taken in health and education sectors to improve infrastructure so that schools and hospitals will deliver services at par with corporate schools and hospitals will remain a game changer. “This will ensure quality education and healthcare for all irrespective of people’s economic status” he said.

On the other hand, opposition TDP accused the YSRC of initiating destructive policies in the last one year. TDP state president Kimidi Kala Venkat Rao said “The chief minister with his ignorance and arrogance has destroyed all institutions and systems in the state. The number of judgements that have been passed against to the government speaks for it. The only thing the government successfully did was to send away all investors from the state. The state has regressed by about ten years in development in the first year of YSRC rule”.

Around 1,200 migrant workers, including 55 madarssa students who were stranded in Telangana for almost two months, boarded the train at 10pm on Thursday from Ghatkesar station on the city outskirts.But several hours into their journey, passengers realised that the chartered train took them to Delhi’s Hazrat Nizamuddin railway station instead of Bihar’s Muzaffarpur junction railway station.A few passengers who reached out to TOI from Nizamuddin station said the train was due to reach Muzaffarpur via Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh and Patna, but the route had been changed without their knowledge. “Some of us asked the driver why we were on the wrong route. The driver told us the train reached Delhi after following instructions of the railway master,” said Mohammad Shoukat, 22, a passenger, adding: “We were supposed to be in Bihar by 6.30 am or 7 am on Saturday. We will now reach Bihar on Sunday”.Passengers protested on the railway tracks at Nizamuddin station demanding accountability for the delay caused due to the mistake of the railway officials . They have also alleged that no food was served to them during the journey.Mohammad Raihan, 28, who was heading the group of 55 madarssa students, said, “ Officials gave us some rice, a bread packet and two water bottles when we started our journey. After that, we did not even receive water on Friday or Saturday.”“We requested railway police officials at Delhi to provide food at least to our children. They said they will make arrangements to provide water at Ghaziabad station, but we did not receive anything there,” he said.When contacted, a South Central Railway spokesperson said, “We have enquired about the delay and found there was no mistake on the part of railway master or anybody else. Since, there is a continuous influx of Shramik trains to places like UP and Bihar, they are taking alternative paths to reach the destination. It will be very difficult if they take the regular route.”“No destination time is given to passengers. They may be assuming the route as per regular train journeys,” he added.

The SCR was able to seize the perfect oppotunity to carry out the maintenance given the current restrictions on passenger train movement.SCR’s chief public relations officer Ch Rakesh said the track maintenance work was undertaken for the first time in 43 years since the bridge was commissioned in 1977.“The work was carried out after maintaining a 36-hour block on the bridge. The work had been pending for the want of such a long block to train services, given the fact that the bridge is critical to the South-East rail link, connecting the two sides of the Godavari on the Vijayawada-Visakhapatnam Railway section,” he said.The work involved laying of track on six spans. The existing railway track (along with sleepers), which had served for a few decades, was removed and replaced with a fresh set of pre-fit lengths of rail track along with sleepers. “The fully automated and mechanised process, which required minimal physical labour, was carried out to expedite the maintenance work. The work presented huge challenges on account of technical aspects associated with the engineering of the bridge, which handles rail traffic on the lower deck and road traffic on the upper deck,” Rakesh said.",kolhapur,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-75936688,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-195806,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/scr-does-maintenance-of-iconic-rail-bridge/articleshow/75925013.cms

Her husband Reetram had alleged that she was killed by her beau Krishan Kumar and an FIR was registered against Kumar at Nigohi police station. However, during investigation, police found that Reetram had killed the victim after finding her in position with her beau. There were at least 40 injuries on the face of the victim and this was considered as one of the most brutal murders reported in recent times in Shahjahanpur.

SHO Indrajeet Bhadauria told TOI, “We were already suspecting that the woman was murdered by her husband but she died before recording her statement. We checked the mobile’s location and spoke with her children and other family members to gather evidence. The husband has confessed to having committed the crime. The accused told us that he used to love his wife a lot and never expected betrayal from her. We have also booked the beau Kumar for cheating as he is also somewhere responsible for destroying the family.”

PANAJI: With the mercury increasingly rising above 35 degrees Celsius in May, the flow of visitors to the popular Pomburpa has started surging, prompting villagers to urge authorities to restrict its use to only locals.

The spring with a perennial flow is believed to have medicinal properties in its cool water and has been frequented by people from many parts of the state for a refreshing bath or a picnic to enjoy the hillside ambience .

“The number of visitors, including tourists from neighbouring states, has started increasing and due to the Covid-19 pandemic, our villagers are apprehensive about the risk to their lives,” Vijay Shirodkar, a local said.

The residents have sent a memorandum to various government agencies, including the tourism department and police to stop outsiders from visiting the spring for picnics and bathing.

“The visitors also drink liquor and fling the bottles everywhere, creating a mess and we cannot do much,” a local said.

The villagers said they have been traditionally using the spring at Palmar for bathing and other uses since hoary times.

A tourism department project had carried out beautification of the spring nearly a decade back. But lack of maintenance has caused decay, and villagers have appealed for a makeover for the spring. Special funds for the maintenance of the spring was announced at the time of the inauguration.

“The lights are not working and the infrastructure is in a bad condition,” Shirodkar said.

As part of the extensive beautification carried out back in 2010, the department had strived to retain the heritage value of the spring as well as its ambience. Separate cubicles for ladies and gents to change their garments were built, as well as a shower facility.

A children's park and eco nature reserve above the spring along with mini gardens and walking tracks were set up.

Elaborate arrangements for parking a stage for hosting cultural activities were also part of the plans conceptualised in 2008.

Five discarded four-wheelers that have been at the reserved site for almost a decade were also removed.

“Initially, the number of houses constructed in the locality was minimum and there was enough vacant space. We did not oppose then. But now, without any space, children were forced to play on the road,” said K Anbu Priyan, vice-president of Bharathi Nagar Residents’ Welfare Association. Close to 100 houses have come up in the layout that is almost three decades old, he added.

Pointing out that encroachers had damaged both the fencings and the board which was installed by the corporation claiming the ownership of the reserved site, he said that they had sought the intervention of the corporation officials only in December when the encroachers had started parking more number of cars at the site.

The corporation had intervened only after the residents staged a protest in January, he said. Meanwhile, the civic body issued a letter on May 19 directing the encroachers to remove the cars within three days and warned of removing the encroachments themselves upon failing to do so.

As the encroachments remained on the reserved site even as the deadline crossed, the civic body had removed it with the help of earthmovers on Saturday. A corporation source said that steps would also be taken to fence the land at the earliest.

Anbu Priyan said the site could be developed into a park.

But the hour-long livestreamed Twitter interaction with the Kerala CM on Saturday was a tame affair marred by technical glitches with long segments of missing audio and video.

“Your first episode of #AskTheCM is so messed up. Audio gets muted every now and then. Video interruption is irritatingly frequent. I hope you address this before the next episode,” tweeted Arun P S, tagging Twitter India which initiated the series. Chief ministers across the country are expected to hold similar Twitter Q&As in coming days.

The session was broadcast using Periscope and hosted by Ardra Balachandran had two segments with the chief minister answering in English a set of questions tweeted using #AskPinarayiVijayan hashtag, mostly on the exemplary way in which Kerala handled the pandemic.

Terming the Kerala model as a people-centric one, Vijayan said the participatory approach to solve problems, high literacy and investments made by the state in human development, especially health and education, helped Kerala overcome these challenges.

In the second session, he answered queries raised by tweeple on a host of concerns over job losses, impact on economy and containment strategy in the backdrop of massive inflow of non-resident Keralites to the state. “Lakhs of people from Kerala are working abroad. A good percentage of them may loss jobs and may return to Kerala. All these people have some skills and we plan to utilize them,” he said.

Answering a question on challenges posed by the digital divide and the accessibility of devices and internet, Vijayan said they can be overcome. “If a household does not have them, public institutions like libraries and clubs can provide such facilities,” Vijayan said while highlighting the K-fone initiative to provide broadband connectivity to the masses.

Regarding concerns of outstation students who have to appear for exams here, Vijayan said the state government view is that exams should be held. “Students from outside may have to go on quarantine for 14 days. If they do not have facility, government will provide them. Students from containment zones would be provided separate facilities,” he said.

The video had a live viewership of around 12,500 viewers, but the average viewer spent only 1.31 minutes because of glitches.

According to the Vadavalli police, the incident took place at the house of a 51-year-old woman at Kamadenu Nagar when her friend, a 29-year-old woman, and a 37-year-old second-hand two-wheeler dealer came there to discuss a possible deal. A police officer said, “The women are members of a self-help group. The 29-year-old had sought Rs 10,000 from the other woman to buy a second-hand scooter. The latter asked her to meet her at her house on Friday afternoon. She also invited the second-hand two-wheeler dealer.”

When the two came to the elderly woman’s house around 2pm on Friday, five people with masks on their faces entered the house and robbed them of all their valuables. “Later, the gang took the young woman and the dealer to the kitchen, removed their clothes and made them pose for photos. They threatened to circulate the photos on social media if they approach police and escaped,” the officer said.

Based on the second-hand two-wheeler dealer’s complaint, Vadavalli police inspector G Manivannan registered a case against the gang under Sections 392 (punishment for robbery), 397 (robbery or dacoity with attempt to cause death or grievous hurt) and 450 (house trespass in order to commit offence punishable with imprisonment for life) of the Indian Penal Code. Police have collected phone call details of the trio and formed a special team to nab the gang.

271,['24/05/2020'],A dull start for Salem autorickshaws on 1st day of restarting services,"Salem: Autorickshaw drivers in Salem city were a disappointed lot as only a few patrons used their services on Saturday. The state government allowed autorickshaws to resume services from Saturday after they were halted since March 23.

“More than 800 autorickshaws were operated in Salem city before the lockdown. On Saturday, only 30% of them resumed operation,” T Sekar, a functionary from INTUC trade union, said.

While some faulted government rules, others pointed to te steep fares charged by drivers.

“Allowing only one passenger in the autorickshaw is a ridiculous move. If a couple wants to go somewhere, will they take two autos,” K Manickam, one of the autorickshaw drivers, asked.

R Kavitha, 22, who wanted to take her mother R Amuthavalli to a private hospital in the new bus stand area from Ammapet, dropped her plan when autorickshaw drivers demanded Rs 300 per vehicle for a single trip and Rs 500 for the round trip. “I would have spent Rs 1000 for two autos to take my mother to the hospital. It would an additional financial burden to my family,” Kavitha said.

Meanwhile, autorickshaw drivers urged the state government to allow them to take two passengers in a trip.

It will also strengthen its monitoring through Whatsapp groups, and divide 33 districts into three parts, assigning an engineer in each of them.“It is expected that another 20,000 to 30,000 labourers may increase in the coming days and we may touch around 40 lakh by the end of the month. It is a huge labour force and the task of its management will become difficult and challenging — like getting their muster rolls processed, ensuring effective work site management and making their payments within 15 days,” said state’s MGNREGA commissioner P C Kishan.“Earlier, the maximum labour force used to be around 30-31 lakh. Even at 30 lakh, the system used to get disturbed. Every system is designed for a certain amount of load. Up to 25 lakh labourers, the system works quite smoothly; up to 30 lakh labourers, extra effort is required,” he added.“Beyond that, it is very difficult to manage. The officers on the ground have to pull up their socks else, it may lead to delays,” he added.He further said, “We can monitor through Whatsapp groups by engaging extra people. I will divide 33 districts into three parts and an engineer will be assigned in each of these three parts for monitoring work. Now, only one executive engineer is overseeing the entire work in the state. We will also engage more BDOs in supervision work. Moreover, we will have to improve work site management and the level of inspection.”“We shall have to ensure that Covid-19 preventive measures are also implemented in the field.

However, after he asked his family to pick him up from a temporary shelter home where he was quarantined, officials told him that his pool test came positive. Later, his individual test report also confirmed positive on Friday night.The asymptomatic patient, a native of Hafizganj in Bareilly, who was working as a 'zari' (hand-embroidery) artisan in Mumbai, said, “I am surprised that I have tested positive even as I never felt sick during the lockdown period . I don’t know how I contracted the virus.”Like him, 18 migrants, mostly from Mumbai and Rajasthan, tested positive for Covid-19 in Bareilly in the past one week. Besides, two relatives of migrants contracted the virus through two patients.Another 24-year-old patient who travelled from Mumbai to Bareilly, along with a 24-year-old youth, said, “The lockdown rendered us jobless and we were surviving on food given by people. In such a difficult time, we desperately wanted to be with our family. We reached Lucknow by a special train and then we were sent to Bareilly in a bus. We couldn’t even meet our parents and siblings as we were transferred from the shelter home to a hospital.”“When I learnt that I have tested positive for Covid-19, I could not believe it initially because I am healthy and had not come in contact with any positive case,” he added.A 40-year-old man, who walked from Jaipur to Hathras and was later sent to Bareilly in a bus, said, “I along with my family members was quarantined at a shelter home in Bareilly.

Though it is a matter of relief that my family is safe, I am clueless about how I have contracted the virus.”District surveillance officer Dr Ranjan Gautam said, “When the migrants from other states are sent, they are screened for fever, which is not the only criterion, as asymptomatic patients do not show symptoms.

276,['24/05/2020'],‘Lockdown sex therapy is good for well-being’,"Dr Sanjay Deshpande

Lockdown is in place for more than two months now and several physical, mental, emotional and psychological health aspects have been thoroughly discussed on various platforms. But, when it comes to sexual wellness, social media is brimming with only jokes.

Dr Sanjay Deshpande, well-known consultant in sexual medicine, is practising in Nagpur since last 25 years. In a ‘lockdown’ interview with TOI, he shared tips for those single, married, in a relationship, living away from partners and those who don’t have partners.

Excerpts..

Q. Are people having more sex during lockdown?

A. Yes, and I believe its great. Everybody is stressed in lockdown and there is uncertainty. We don’t know when it will end or if it will be extended again. Many of us are working from home and it has its own stress. Many are stuck away from families. Some have kids to look after, others have ailing elderly people at home. There is physical, mental and social stress. Moreover, there are clouds of financial uncertainty hovering over us. Sex can be a remedy to all such stressful situations. It could be the distraction that you need amid this unpredictable crisis. It’s communication, relaxation and exercise. Sex reduces pain, its anti-hypertensive and stress-buster. Sex is must-have thing in lockdown. However, I have observed that the excitement about sex in lockdown-1 has gone down gradually until lockdown-4.

Q. What new problems are your patients sharing with you especially after Covid-19 crisis?

A. To my surprise, I am attending 10-12 patients in one session, which is almost like normal times. Many couples are using this period to fix sexual problems. Some are using this period to re-explore the lost pleasure in their relationship, which is a positive thing. Certainly, sex life has seen many changes during the Covid-19 crisis. Cohabiting with a family, managing day-to-day chores in travel ban and commuting limitations and, most importantly, added stress from following coronavirus news are affecting one’s sex life. Some are getting too much privacy and getting bored, while others have lost their private moments as all family members are at home all the time.

Q. What do you suggest to those who are living away from partners?

A. There are many couples who had to stay away from each other due to travel restrictions. Many in secret relationships who used to meet regularly are not getting opportunities. Singles also get sexual desire during extended free time offered by lockdown. I tell them you are the best partner for yourself and masturbation is the safest and best way to get sexual pleasure during Covid crisis. It’s not possible to maintain Covid distancing during sexual activity and having sex with an unknown partner is full of infection risk. Even while having sex with an known partner, both should take special care of sexual hygiene. Sexual minorities like LGBT should also take care of hygiene. Covid-19 does not spread through sexual intercourse, but it’s important to stay safe.

Q. What do you suggest to those who go out for work?

A. Take special care about hygiene so that they should not carry infection with them. If your partner is having cough, cold, fever or other symptoms, you should avoid having sex. Ultimately, sex is for pleasure and not to be done under pressure.

Q. Several incidents of child abuse have been noticed during lockdown.

A. It's a harsh reality. Parent have an additional responsibility to look after their kids. If your child is willing to share something, you should listen with patience. Awareness is the key in such matters.

Q. Lot of buzz about the probable baby boom due to lockdown. Your take?

A. Many couples are indeed experiencing a better sexual life, especially those who had busy schedules and little time for each other in the pre-Covid era. Many of them may plan pregnancy during this period. If you and your partner want it, its perfectly all right. But, I suggest people to use contraceptives and avoid unplanned pregnancy during this period. Even married or newly married couples should delay the pregnancy in current situation. Because pregnancy means you have to visit hospitals regularly and coronavirus threat is here to stay for a long time.

Q. What can be the post-Covid situation?

A. I would say post lockdown. People may be anxious after lockdown relaxation. Many will meet up after long gap and chances of unprotected sex are more. People must avoid sex with unknown partners. Those who are into hookups and night stands should be more careful. Sex life is not going to be as easy as it used to be before lockdown. Golden advice from me would be stay indoors and have it only with your most trustworthy partner.

An official said that 281 passengers alighted from the Delhi to Margao Rajdhani Express while 26 alighted from the Thiruvananthapuram to Delhi train at Margao.

All those who alighted at Margao were sent to the new district hospital for testing.

There was no train from Margao leaving for any destination with migrant workers on Saturday. Sources said that around 251 inmates of the Navelim shelter were ferried to Karmali by the authorities to enable them board the Shramik special.

Migrant labourers, who are getting impatient at being unable to get a place on the Shramik special trains, are pulling on with the hope that they will get lucky in the next couple of days.

Thousands have assembled at the Manohar Parrikar indoor stadium in Navelim where arrangements have been made for their accommodation. The last couple of days have seen the authorities facing a rough time in managing the affairs at the shelter. On Saturday, arranging food for them was not an easy task. Other facilities, such as mobile toilets, had been enhanced on Friday, as the numbers had swelled beyond expectation.

An AAP functionary urged the CM to intervene saying that a large number of migrants were at the shelter and that food was limited.

Meanwhile, South Western Railways opened its counters for bookings at Hubballi, Dharwad, Belagavi, Vasco, Bellary, Hospet and Vijaypura. They will be open from 8am to 5pm, an official said. In view of Ramzan being a national holiday, reservation counters will function from 8am to 2pm on May 25.

PUNE: The Pune Municipal Corporation is planning to complete the crucial pre-monsoon work of cleaning stormwater channels , drains and repair chambers by the end of May.

The administration has said that about 19,000 stormwater chambers out of the total 24,000 have been cleaned so far and the remaining are expected to be cleaned before the arrival of the monsoon.

As per the PMC’s data, the city has about 1,400km-long roads, which are more than six-metre wide. Of these, about 650km-long roads have stormwater drains. The administration has identified stormwater channels on about 200km-long roads, which need to be cleaned before the monsoon to prevent waterlogging. About 165km-long stormwater drains have been cleaned so far, officials said.

Work is also underway in the containment zones with due precaution and permission from the city police. About 300 workers have been deployed for cleaning the drainage and channels. All of them have been issued identity cards and have been told to undergo health checks.

During the last year’s monsoon, many roads witnessed huge flooding which had put a question mark on the quality of pre-monsoon work carried out in the city.

An official said, ""The administration has taken two important steps this time. A software has been introduced to monitor cleaning of every chamber and stormwater channel. This software sends real-time updates to the system after cleaning is done at a particular spot. The work progress can be monitored every day. About eight contracts have been issued for eight zones for the cleaning work. A team of 40 engineers, appointed in these eight zones, is monitoring the work through a web-based app.""

The civic administration has also introduced changes in the allotment of cleaning work this year. Till last year, the work used to be allotted by the zonal offices. This year, the responsibility of allotment and monitoring of work has been given to the road development department.

281,['24/05/2020'],Pune: Civic staff in a fix over action against dilapidated structures,"This year, the civic body has identified 250 properties that pose a threat to lives

PUNE: The demolition of dilapidated structures in the city’s containment zones ahead of the monsoon has become a cause of concern for the civic administration .

The Pune Municipal Corporation ( PMC ) has identified 15 rundown structures as extremely risky in the central parts of the city, which include Kasba Peth , Bhavani Peth , Guruwar Peth, Shukrawar Peth, Nana Peth, Ganesh Peth, Shaniwar Peth and Rasta Peth . With maximum number of Covid-19 cases, these areas have been classified as containment zone.

The civic officials said given the severity of the outbreak in these areas, they can neither ask the occupants of these structures to evacuate the properties nor can they risk lives of the latter owing to the probability of the weakened structure crumbling down.

The PMC carries out action against dangerous properties in the municipal limits every year ahead of the monsoon. The residents of these properties are asked to move out to safer places and the vacant structures are demolished. This year, the civic body has identified 250 properties that pose threat to lives. As many as 25 of the 250 properties are identified as “extremely risky” and 15 of these are in the containment zone, while the remaining 10 are in the non-containment zones.

“We had served notices to the property owners of these structures, but they are yet to vacate the houses. This has complicated the process. The staff is in a fix on how to handle the situation,” a civic official said.

Civic officials said the demolition drive would also focus on pulling down dangerous retaining wall and labour camps. “The drive in the non-containment zones has already started.

PUNE: Three men on Saturday were detained by the Hadapsar police on the charge of hacking to death a 21-year-old man with past criminal records near Bhekrainagar on Saswad Road on Friday night.

Police have identified the deceased as Shoaib Shaikh (20) from Hadapsar.

Police said Shaikh and two others were riding on a motorcycle on Friday night when the suspects travelling in a car hit his vehicle from the behind. “The impact of the collision made Shaikh fall on the road. He soon realised who was in the car and took to the heels on spotting the trio,” assistant inspector Dilip Gade from Hadapsar police said.

“The trio then chased Shaikh and caught him near the lane of a private hospital and hacked him to death. They fled the spot after the incident,” Gade said.

The officer said the suspects have been monitoring Shaikh ever since he was released on a bail in 2018.

“Prima facie probe revealed that Shaikh and the suspects were friends but had a fallout in 2018 after the deceased assaulted them. Shaikh was then arrested in a case of attempted murder but was later released on bail,” the officer added.

291,['24/05/2020'],Not so sweet times for savoury makers of North Karnataka,"peda

Hubballi: In addition to the profusion of tourist destinations that dot the landscape of North Karnataka , visitors to the region look forward to indulging themselves in the various delicacies that each district has to offer. If it is the pedha in Dharwad , it is the kunda in Belagavi , the nutrient-rich kardant is a specialty in Gokak and the ironically named ‘khara (the word means spicy in Kannada)’ is famous in Savanur. However, the lockdown has sent their businesses on a downward spiral, and they are not too optimistic about being able to revive their business .

The owners of these savoury units point to the exodus of migrant labourers as being one of the major hurdles to resumption of business.

Umesh Thakur, owner of Babusingh Thakur Pedha, said that the months of April and May, when the wedding calendar was packed, were months that generated tremendous business for savoury makers. “With the lockdown enforced in the two months, we incurred massive losses. We prepared 350kg of Dharwad Pedha every day, but we are able to make no more than 40kg now. It will probably take a year for business to return to the state it was in prior to the lockdown,” Thakur added.

Thakur’s workforce has also shrunk from 40 to 15, with many of his skilled labourers having returned to their homes in Bihar and Uttar Pradesh.

Owner of Sadanand Sweets in Gokak Uday Devarmani said that production of the famed kardant at his company had come down from 20 quintals every day to just 100kg. The delicacy, which is an amalgam of dry fruits in a thick paste of jaggery, was earlier shipped to various parts of the country and abroad. “I am running my factory with three or four labourers, where I had 20 earlier. We are receiving orders for kardant from more than 60 distributors, but lack of transport facilities has meant that we have not been able to meet the demand,” he added.

Rajesh Kotak, owner of Savanur Khara in Haveri district, said that most of his customers were too afraid to turn up at his store, as a result of which his business had nosedived.

Atul Purohit, maker of kunda in Belagavi, said that production of the sweet at his unit had dropped from 100kg per day to 10kg. “Business has taken a very bad hit owing to the lockdown,” Purohit said.

295,['24/05/2020'],CRPF women beef up security at containment zones,"NAGPUR: An all-woman company of the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF), part of the battalion tasked to guard highly sensitive Srinagar airport and volatile Imphal, has been deployed to guard some of the 19 containment zones in the city. This is in addition to the SRPF, city police and riot police.

It’s learnt that the company, which has 83 women commandos under assistant commandant Pragya Bajpayee, has been posted at important containment zones like Satranjipura, Gaddigodam, Shanti Nagar and a few others.

There is no clarity on who requisitioned the CRPF. Divisional commissioner Sanjeev Kumar said police commissioner BK Upadhyay “will be in a better person to explain”. Municipal commissioner Tukaram Mundhe declined to comment on the issue.

Upadhyay said the prime focus of the commandos would be to strengthen the security at the containment zones. “State has sent the force on its own,” he said.

Sources from the Nagpur Municipal Corporation told TOI that Mundhe and his team were not happy with police’s efforts in guarding the containment zones. In recent days, Mominpura and Satranjipura has seen a spike in cases despite the two localities being notified as containment zones on April 4 and April 6, respectively.

“The commissioner had raised the issue of movement of people within containment zones with CP a few times and also held review meetings with police. When it did not help, he requested home minister Anil Deshmukh to explore options like CRPF,” the sources said.

Senior cops TOI spoke to said there was no question of any “lacklustre show by city police”.

While the CRPF women are well-equipped with face shields, masks, half gowns and gloves, city cops are using only cloth masks and gloves.

“We have provided face shields, gloves, sanitizers and also PPE kits at the police stations. Constables should use protective gears,” said Upadhyay.

296,['24/05/2020'],Candolim civic body refunds ‘train’ fees,"Panaji: A week after collecting money from shack operators and workers with the promise of special trains to West Bengal and Odisha, minister for ports Michael Lobo’s plan has been scrapped.

On Saturday, some of the money was returned to the workers and employers who had paid between Rs 1,200 and Rs 1,500 per person for a ticket to return home.

Several hundred workers, mostly employed in the hospitality industry, had gathered outside Calangute MLA and ports minister Michael Lobo’s residence at Parra with 2,800 people registering for the trains.

Sources within the government and Konkan Railways said that there was no provision to charter special trains when the Centre has already announced Shramik Special trains to help stranded labourers return home.

“We stopped collecting money after the collector told us that there was no permission for the trains. Candolim panchayat had collected some money and whatever was collected was given back,” general secretary of the Shack Owners’ Welfare Society (SOWS), John Lobo said.

Most of the workers employed in shacks, hotels and restaurants hail from West Bengal, Odisha and Jharkhand. Shack owners had urged the state to arrange for trains so that they could send their staff back home.

297,['24/05/2020'],Id-ul-Fitr to be celebrated across the state tomorrow,"Hyderabad: Id-ul-Fitr , or the festival of alms-giving that marks the end of the fasting month of Ramzan, will be celebrated on Monday under the shadow of Covid-19 lockdown.

The crescent for Shawwal, the 10th month of Islamic Hijri calendar, was not sighted anywhere in Telangana and Andhra Pradesh on Saturday and thus Sunday will be the 30th day of Ramzan.

Moulana Mufti Khaleel Ahmad, vice-chancellor of leading Islamic deemed university Jamia Nizamia, said Id-ul-Fitr will be celebrated on Monday as none of the state-level official moon-sighting committees across India confirmed the sighting of the crescent on Saturday.

“The sky was clear in sparts of the country. But nowhere the crescent was sighted,” Mufti Khaleel, who is also a member of the official moon-sighting panel for Deccan region, said. Id prayers will not be held in congregation, he said, urging Muslims to offer thanksgiving Namaz at home.

With the lockdown hitting the livelihood of millions of people, Ramzan 2020 has been a subdued personal affair for Muslims as many decided to celebrate the Id on a low key. Islamic scholars have called upon the community not to buy clothes and other accessories this Id, but donate the money to the poor and migrant labour.

Ramzan has always been a mega affair both in spiritual and temporal terms in Hyderabad. Right from the day Hyderabad was founded by Mohammad Quli Qutub Shah V in 1591, Ramzan and Id have been an integral part of the Deccani Tehzeeb (tradition) with the Charminar and its vicinity coming to life.

For the first time in about a century, the aura of Ramzan is missing thanks to Covid-19. Lad Bazaar, a symbol of celebration for over four centuries, wears a deserted look. Ramzan 2020 was more about virtual bonding rather than personal one, thanks to social distancing.

She and her brothers, Karamdip and Karamjit Singh , eat food from the packets provided by Karnataka police. Meet spends her days trying to plead with the authorities to help her cross the border into Goa, weeping hysterically at her fate every now and then.While being raised in Goa and still a teenager, Meet found herself orphaned following the sudden death of her parents. The three siblings have not known what it’s like living anywhere else, until this January, when Meet briefly moved to Kerala for work.“I am well known among the entire biker community as a much sought-after mechanic for Royal Enfield bikes. Look to what state I have been reduced to here. I was called to Kerala for short-term assignments and moved there in January with my brothers with the intention of returning to Goa once I am done with the work at hand. Suddenly the coronavirus cases in Kerala began rising and now we want to return home to Goa,” said Meet, pointing to the trio’s Aadhar cards and other documents, which indicate an address in Santa Cruz.Karamdip said, unable to afford a home, they had been living in rented premises all their life and are now being denied entry into Goa with no permanent address to call home.“Goa is home for us. It is where we are most comfortable. We were orphaned as children and had a hard life because of which we could not educate ourselves. Now the authorities are asking us to fill different forms, which is Greek to us. No one is showing us the way forward. I am crying seeing my sister wailing in pain,” said Karamdip.The siblings said they already had a difficult journey back towards Goa through different police checks and hitching rides, only to sleep out in the open at Polem.“When we left for Kerala, we had to give up our rented place as we did not know the definite time period of the job for which I was hired.

301,['24/05/2020'],20 TN natives from Chile left to fend for themselves in Delhi,"Madurai: After facing two months of gruelling lockdown in Chile and Argentina, as many as 20 natives of Tamil Nadu, including a pregnant woman, returned to India on May 21 only to find themselves stranded in Delhi. They said they are in a constant state of fear and uncertainty as they have been asked by authorities to fend for themselves.

They are to complete quarantine for 14 days in Delhi and make arrangements to return to Tamil Nadu on their own. As no arrangements have been made so far by the Tamil Nadu government to help them return to at least Chennai, they submitted petitions to chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswami as well as MPs S Venkatesan and A Raja in this regard.

All 20 had reached Delhi on the morning of May 21 via a special flight LATAM, which was carrying around 50 Indians. Among the 20 TN natives, 10 are post-doctoral research fellows working on projects while the others are software engineers and hotel staff. Among them is a si-month pregnant woman as well.

“For two months, there was complete lockdown in Chile and our livelihoods were greatly affected. The lab I work at also shut down. It was after much struggle that we learnt of the special flight co-ordinated by Argentinian and Indian authorities that would travel via Australia and drop us off at Delhi. We saw it as our only chance and shelled out Rs 1 Lakh for the flight,” said Muneeswaran T, a post-doctoral research fellow in nano-biotechnology who was working in Chile. Though initially they were told that they would help make arrangements for return to Tamil Nadu after spending a few days in Delhi, now officials are telling them it was not possible.

“On reaching Delhi, officials took our passports and luggage, and immediately asked us to pick hotels to be quarantined at. They said that after 14 days, we would be given passes which we could use and then make our own arrangements to return to Tamil Nadu once public transport is restored. We have no idea how long we will be here and our families are also in distress,” said Muneeswaran. They were forced to bear all expenses for their 14-day quarantine stay in Delhi where they could find accommodation only in luxury hotels charging Rs 3,000-4,000 a day. They said they have even been asked to pay for the Covid-19 test which they would have to take after 13 days.

On Saturday night, N E Chinnadurai, joint resident commissioner, Tamil Nadu House, reached out to them and promised to help make life easier during their stay at Delhi. However, there was no mention of arrangements for return to Tamil Nadu.

NEW DELHI/MUMBAI: Two days before domestic airlines are set to resume flights, the Congress-led Chhattisgarh government has said the Centre should not open up the skies or the rail routes without putting in place effective standard operation procedures (SOPs). No commercial flight will take off or land in Mumbai airport owing to lockdown restrictions, a top Maharashtra official said.

Chhattisgarh CM Bhupesh Baghel wrote to civil aviation minister Hardeep Singh Puri and rail minister Piyush Goyal demanding SOPs for passengers, a mandatory 14-day quarantine, and insisted that the state government must receive prior information, including contact details, of all passengers who choose to travel.

Raising concerns over the resumption of flight services without any SOP, Baghel asserted that it should be made operational only with strict and effective guidelines. He also said it may not be possible to avert the further spread of coronavirus if domestic flight services are resumed at the time when there is a spike in corona positive cases in the country.

A senior Maharashtra bureaucrat told TOI since the entire Mumbai Metropolitain Region as well as Pune and Aurangabad districts are in red zone, it will not be advisable to allow flights. ""We have informed MIAL, which control the Mumbai airport that, unless it finetunes airport operations... We will allow only emergency flights and on compassionate grounds only,'' the bureaucrat said.

Earlier, Tamil Nadu said it didn't want domestic flights to resume during the lockdown which is on till May 31.

PUNE: Super cyclonic storm Amphan sucked out moisture from major parts of peninsular and central India, triggering heatwave conditions in parts of Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh , Chhattisgarh, some areas of coastal Andhra Pradesh and north interior Karnataka, and parts of Rayalseema.

Scientists in India Meteorological Department ( IMD ) told TOI on Saturday that the drastic depletion of moisture pushed up the day temperature significantly in these regions. The heatwave conditions are likely to continue for the next two to three days. The heatwave condition is likely to develop over Marathwada and Rayalseema after 24 hours.

The current heatwave situation in parts of the country including, north and northwest India, is the first largest spell in terms of its expanse for the summer of 2020. IMD scientists stated that the heatwave in north India was not a result of Amphan, but the super cyclone brought about heatwave conditions in parts of peninsular India and central India since May 20-21.

Anupam Kashyapi, head of weather, IMD, Pune said, “The super cyclone depleted all the moisture from peninsular India, even from Vidarbha, parts of Marathwada and central India during its passage and fag end, causing the day temperature to surge, expediting a heatwave situation in these regions from around May 18-21 — around the period of Amphan’s peak form and landfall. The heatwave conditions in parts of peninsular and central India are likely to continue during the next couple of days.”

He said the ongoing heatwave situation was the first largest in India for this summer in terms of its areas-wise spread.

“Amphan’s passage over the Bay of Bengal and exit are majorly responsible for the heatwave situation in parts of peninsular India, central India up to Madhya Pradesh and Vidarbha. The super cyclone has not only put parts of central and peninsular India in a heatwave spell, but it has also reduced chances of summer rain there for some days because of the moisture depletion and high temperature,” added Kashyapi.

On Saturday evening, IMD issued an alert stating that heatwave conditions were likely over some parts of Rajasthan with severe heatwave at isolated pockets. It said heatwave conditions were very likely in some parts of Punjab, Haryana, Chandigarh, Delhi and Vidarbha during the next 4-5 days. It added that heatwave conditions were very likely in isolated pockets of Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and southern parts of Uttar Pradesh during the next four-five days, and over coastal Andhra Pradesh and Telangana during the next three days.

They were stranded in front of Madurai Kamaraj University (MKU), a makeshift quarantine facility for those returning from other states, for 12 hours before finally heading home.

C Shanmugavel, 30, working as a waiter in a hotel in Mumbai and his wife Adhilakshmi, 27, along with their two kids aged two and four were stranded in the city and struggling to make ends meet since the lockdown was announced. They had applied to travel to Tamil Nadu. A private bus, that had gone from Madurai to Rajasthan with guest workers on May 16 and was returning to Tamil Nadu, picked up 21 people including the family from Mumbai. At 6 pm on Thursday the bus started from Mumbai and after covering more than 1,400 km reached Vadipatti check post around 11.45 pm on Friday.

“The pass was valid only till Friday so we had to enter Madurai before midnight,” S Laxman, one of the two bus drivers said. The bus was accompanied by a police escort vehicle to the quarantine facility at MKU at around 1 am. But the couple and their kids were denied entry into the campus. The rest of the passengers were taken to the quarantine facility and asked to stay there till their test results for Covid-19 came. “The police officer who escorted us said that only those returning to Madurai will be allowed to the quarantine facility,” Shanmugavel said and added that the family was asked to find their way home.

Without any transport facility, they were stranded in the dark. An argument broke out between the bus driver and the police as the police asked the drivers to drop the family at Theni. “I told them that we only had a travel pass to travel till Madurai. Theni police would seize the bus if we entered that district without a pass. But we did not want to abandon the helpless couple with small kids in the night,” driver Laxman said.

The drivers asked the family to stay in the bus till morning or till they got help. The family managed to relieve themselves on Saturday morning at the quarantine facility and got breakfast after contacting the police control room at 10.30 am.. After the incident was brought to the notice of the district administration, a fresh e-pass was provided for the bus to take the family to Theni. They bus left for Theni at around 1 pm – 12 hours after the ordeal began.

Health and civic authorities will now be on their toes as the number of vehicles with e-passes returning from Chennai, a hotspot, has been witnessing a surge post the relaxations to lockdown was announced.

The five, who have been admitted to MGMGH, include a man from Vayalur road employed in Perambalur, a Thiruverumbur-based policeman and an elderly couple from Karumandapam who returned from Chennai, and a woman — a contact of a Chennai returnee. The corporation collected 12 samples from their close contacts while other contacts are being traced.

“We are disinfecting the entire wards where positive cases were reported twice a day. Waste from the houses of the patients is collected separately,” a corporation official said.

No containment zone needs to be set up since five or more cases have to be reported from an area for that as per the revised directives.

Civic body sources said they are coordinating with the police to trace people arriving from other districts.

Details of returnees from other districts are recorded at 16 check posts on Trichy district’s borders and shared with the health department, police sources said.

The Samayapuram toll plaza handles 7,000 vehicles a day now, mostly passenger cars, in place of only 2,000 during the lockdown.

“Details of people entering the city with e-passes are being shared with us for follow-ups. The quarantined houses are monitored,” a senior official with the city corporation added.

People returning from other districts have been asked to alert the corporation officials.

Now, a large section of the crowd is also making its way to MMCRI, already stretched thin in terms of resources owing to the staff currently working at the Covid-19 laboratory at the institution.The Covid-19 laboratory at MMCRI is testing throat swabs for the fatal novel coronavirus from five districts in South Karnataka. In addition to deployment of staff for operations at the laboratory, doctors, nurses and other personnel are working at the Mysuru’s designated Covid-19 hospital. Consequently, this has left the hospital with a skeletal staff to serve other patients.The lack of a district hospital compelled the Karnataka health and family welfare department to rope in healthcare personnel from MMCRI at the Covid-19 hospital. The district hospital that has been built is yet to start operations after recruitment of doctors and other medical staff.MMCRI dean and director Dr CP Nanjaraj pointed out that, since Mysuru district had one active cases, the focus of the hospital administration had now shifted to the running of the outpatient department. “Despite the challenges, our staff has managed ensure that operations are not affected. But it will become difficult to run the show if the situation gets out of hand. We urge the health department to recruit more personnel,” Dr Nanjaraj said.Through the duration of the lockdown, the OPD at KR and Cheluvamba hospitals had been shut, with only emergency cases being attended to at the two institutions.

Whatever information is being received is through FAO. The situation of locusts in Pakistan is alarming and now these are entering Rajasthan. The Centre is not getting enough cooperation from the state government and now these locusts have reached Madhya Pradesh and other parts of the country, he added. He alleged that lakhs of farmers in Rajasthan were to receive the benefit of PM Kisan Samman Nidhi , but the Congress government has not sent data due to which the farmers were denied the benefit.

KOZHIKODE: Confusion prevailed in Kannur for hours after it was known that the train from Mumbai carrying around 1,000 passengers would halt at the station on Saturday.

The district administration and the health authorities had no clue about the arrival of the train that left Lokmanya Tilak Terminus in Mumbai on Friday night. The information was that the train will halt only at Thiruvananthapuram. There were many passengers who wanted to alight at various stations in Malabar. Railways heeded to their request for a stop in Kannur.

The train’s stoppage in Kannur was not communicated to authorities till 11am. Revenue, health and police personnel swung into action soon after they were informed. Station premises was sanitized and a medical team was rushed to the station.

The train arrived around 3pm and 156 passengers alighted at the station. District collector T V Subash told media persons that the complete details of the passengers were not available with the district administration.

After registration and medical examination, the passengers were taken to the institutional quarantine centres at Thottada and Mundayad.

318,['24/05/2020'],Kolkata: Citizens run from pillar to post for water after power cut sparks crisis,"People queue up at a generator shop on Ganesh Chandra Avenue on Saturday.

KOLKATA: Left with no water at home since Thursday because of a power cut , Samanta Dhar, a teacher who lives in Azadgarh, roamed the entire length of NSC Bose Road in Tollygunge in search of 20-litre jars of packaged drinking water. But shops have run out of packaged drinking water due to a water crisis that has hit large areas of Tollygunge due snapped power supply lines.

As the Kolkata Municipal Corporation teams struggled to remove uprooted trees for the third consecutive day from added areas, like Behala, Tollygunge and Jadavpur, residents tried in vain to lobby with utility agencies and KMC for restoration of power. Without it, they cannot get access to filtered water. On Saturday, Bijon Mukherjee, a resident of Shahidnagar off EM Bypass, paid Rs 2,500 to hire a generator set to pump up water from his ground-floor tank to the second floor. “We have been living in hell — no electricity and no water. I finally had to pay Rs 2,500 to a local businessman for a generator to get water from our reservoir. We will somehow manage in this way for the next two days. But we don’t know what we will do if the power is not restored by then,” he said.

In fact, hiring generators has become a feature in vast areas of Behala and Tollygunge, too, which have come under the grip of a severe water crisis because of non-availability of power for three days.

Sangita Saha, a homemaker in Shantinagar, close to Moore Avenue, has been asking a person who delivers water to get her some ever since power was cut off in the area after a large tree fell on overhead wires. The tree could not be removed and, as a result, power is yet to be restored. “I have not seen such water crisis in the locality in the past 20 years,” Saha said.

According to a water supply department official , efforts were on to restore supply in areas which have been badly hit by the water crisis. “We have asked the power utility agencies to restore supply by Sunday so that we can resume drinking water supply at the earliest,” said the official.

This has inconvenienced many patients but proved beneficial for four schizophrenic siblings from Pulgaon earlier this week.Studies say that around 1 in 100 people in a community develop schizophrenia. This case is rarest of rare as all four siblings are suffering from schizophrenia, say experts.Turned away from a government hospital in Sewagram due to Covid rush, a schizophrenic patient reached Acharya Vinoba Bhave Rural Hospital (AVBRH), Sawangi Meghe, last week. Here, she was treated in proper psychiatry ward . Now, her sister and two brothers, who too are suffering from similar disorder, are set to get treatment.“We are planning for psychosocial rehabilitation such as involving them in candle making, drawing-painting and gardening because there is no earning member in the family. They rely on pension of their deceased father who was a railway employee. Their mother is the only normal member in the family,” said professor Dr Pradeep Patil, HoD of Psychiatry Department of the hospital who shared this unique case study with TOI on the eve of World Schizophrenia Day “This 30-year-old unmarried girl from Pulgaon in Wardha district came to us earlier this week with complaints of poor oral intake, delusion about hearing voices, fearfulness, using abusive language, and irritability. She was admitted to female psychiatry ward and psychiatric treatment was initiated,” said Dr Patil.During investigation, it was revealed that patient’s three siblings too are schizophrenic. “They are patient’s two brothers and an elder sister. Their eldest sister too used to be schizophrenic but she died, they said. Now, two sisters are admitted in our hospital for schizophrenia,” Dr Patil said.“On further inquiry, we came to know that the maternal uncle of this patient also suffered from symptoms of schizophrenia. But their mother and father had no symptoms. This is rarest of rare case of five siblings with this disorder. I have came across such case for the first time in my 25-year-old career,” said Dr Patil.Dr Madhuri Thorat, medical superintendent of the regional mental hospital, too was amused on finding out about the case. “I have seen two or three brothers or sisters in family having schizophrenia, but this case is one-of-its-kind,” she said.Veteran psychiatric Dr Sudhir Bhave said that it’s a known fact that siblings exhibit similar symptoms but four of family is very rare. “Schizophrenia is genetic. In this case the family is fortunate that they will get proper treatment now,” he said.Schizophrenia is a mental condition which affects normal functioning of the brain. The condition interferes with a person’s ability to feel, act and think.Some schizophrenic patients recover completely and find an improvement in their symptoms. But others continue to suffer for a prolonged period and the distressing symptoms can last for years.",nagpur,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-75937977,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-112903,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/covid-rush-at-govt-hosp-leads-to-rehab-for-4-schizophrenic-siblings/articleshow/75928179.cms

323,['24/05/2020'],1-passenger norm adds to autos’ woes as they return,"Madurai/Trichy: A large number of autorickshaws hit the roads on Saturday in Madurai and Trichy as the state government allowed them to resume operations after 59 days. However, to their utter disappointment, only a few people opted for the service due to the restriction to carry only one customer per ride.

To add to their woes, police personnel penalized erring auto drivers with Rs 500 fine in Madurai. Indeed, two people were allowed, but only in case of medical emergency and after showing proof of appointment fixed with hospital. Auto drivers led by R Deivaraj, president of Madurai city auto rickshaw drivers’ union, have urged the government to allow them to carry at least two passengers. More than 50 drivers from various parts of the city took part in a protest in front of the district collector’s office in support of this demand.

In Trichy, the mobile application-based service providers of autos and cabs in the city and suburbs witnessed hardly 5% bookings. The service providers in Trichy receive an average 25,000 bookings a day of which 65% account for autorickshaws. “There are no outsiders in the city in the absence of public transportation. Also, since public events were suspended, our daily bookings have gone for a toss,” a representative of a service provider said. Though the drivers were provided with face masks and sanitisers, people were hesitant to hire cabs and autorickshaws.

N Kuruvan, an auto driver from Arapalayam in Madurai said, “We have lost our livelihood for two months. Government said it had distributed Rs 1,000 to unorganized sector workers, but none of us got it.” M Ilangovan, an auto driver from Bethaniyapuram, said every autorickshaw owner requires Rs 1,500 for oil serving and to check complaints like battery as the vehicle was not used for two months, but none of them have the money, he said.

“I wanted to visit a relative place along with my husband for a funeral, but could not find an autorickshaw as the driver refused to take more than one passenger,” said S Manjula of Bethaniyapuram.

Closure of movie halls and temples have cost a fortune for the autorickshaws. Women and family members who usually rely on app-based transportation platforms in Trichy are yet to go back to the system. “It is an impractical restriction, families are not hiring us. Autos are hailed only for medical emergencies now,” A Mohammed Aliyar, a driver said.

G Chellapandi, a mechanic from Puttuthoppu, said it has been a week since they opened shop, but not many vehicles had turned up. “Auto drivers do not have adequate money to feed their family. Then how do we expect them to spend on vehicle,” he said.

By the afternoon of May 22 (Friday), things had changed drastically for Vinod, who found himself squatting under a lone tree along a deserted highway in Canacona with eight others, in the scorching summer heat.Without food or water, Vinod and seven others were sent to the spot, seven kilometres from the Polem checkpost by Goa officials, who said it was to avoid crowding.Neither Karnataka officials nor Goa officials are providing us information about the procedure to cross over. We can neither eat nor drink, neither live nor die,” said Vinod, who worked as a daily wage labourer in Calangute during this time in Goa.“They told us that if any bus from Karnataka comes to take us, this is the pick-up point. But we are out of food and water and if we have to make an enquiry, we will have to cover seven kilometres by foot again to the check-post.Among the group of eight is a fellow labourer Mahantappa Komaragopadda with his family of four, including children, and a couple Mala Solanki and Giriyappa Patted, who had arrived as tourists.“We had arrived from Hubballi as tourists on March 19 and within days there was a lockdown . After spending more than a month at different lodges, we decided we could not live like this any longer and caught whatever public buses were available to get from Calangute to Margao,” said Mala.It is on this bus that the couple met the labourers from Karnataka and hired a shared taxi to Polem.Even while in distress himself, Vinod doesn’t fail to point to the two other families stuck at the Polem check-post with five children below the age of four.“We were working at a construction site in Valpoi and heard there is a bus available from Polem to Karnataka at 7am, so we hitched a ride on trucks and other goods vehicles to get here. We thought we would be leaving at 7am from Goa so did not get anything to eat with us for the children. They are only sipping on water since we left Valpoi on Friday morning,” said Saroja Lamani, a young mother of two, as her husband has queued up with at least 100 other workers to get a permit to enter Karnataka.“If anyone is left stranded here, it is because the Karnataka government has not accepted their application. It is our job to make it clear to them that if they cross over with no bus to take them to the nearest township, they may be stuck on the Karnataka side of the border in an uninhabited area,” said a Goa official.At twilight, Vinod and the group of seven others began their trek to the Polem check-post again, with no sign of any bus.“There is no place to buy food or water around. But we hope to get back somehow to our village where we have land to grow something we can eat. Here, we do not how long it will be before we get regular jobs again. For now, we will spend the night at the Polem check-post, where at least there will be some safety for the women and children,” said Vinod.By Saturday afternoon, a starving and frustrated Vinod had set out to return to Calangute, with no help forthcoming. He took off by foot hoping to hitch a ride. Mahantappa, his wife Shantavva and children Nagraj (12) and daughter Akshata (10) were issued permits to cross over with no buses.Mahantappa said that his family refused to enter Karnataka for fear of being stuck in a forested area with no transport home.“We are being asked to choose either to cross the border with no guarantee of transport or to shift to the shelter for in Margao.

A majority of them in different blocks of the district have not been provided ration by the local administration, sources said. Besides, their health check-up has not been done.

After a group of migrant labourers under home quarantine in a few villages of Shamshabad block registered a complaint with the district control room, the district magistrate has issued a notice to the block development officer seeking clarification. Besides, the sub-divisional magistrates have been directed to ensure that migrants do not suffer from hunger and are deprived of other basic requirements.

There are 695 villages in 15 blocks of the district. During the lockdown, around 2,000 workers have returned from other states to their homes in 138 villages of the district. These people have been kept under home quarantine.

Earlier, the state government had ordered the formation of village monitoring committees to take care of the needs of the migrant labours and ensure that they follow home quarantine. However, the majority of these committees remain inactive due to lack of monitoring by the local administration.

A village head in Bah block told TOI, “Local authorities have not made adequate arrangements for ration and other basic requirements of the migrant workers who returned from other states. Health department teams are yet to come for their checkup. These people are surviving on food provided by neighbours and relatives.”

District magistrate Prabhu N Singh said, “We are taking feedback from the migrant workers who had returned to their homes in different villages of the district. Unsatisfactory feedback was received from Shamshabad block. People had complained of not getting ration and other essentials. In this regard, a notice has been issued to the block development officer seeking clarification. Officials have been sent to different villages to communicate with the migrant labourers and address their problems in a time-bound manner.”

On Saturday, chief development officer J Reebha along with a police team visited villages in Bah block to take stock of the problems being faced by the migrant workers.

According to the health department officials, of the 2,000 workers who have returned during lockdown, samples of 127, who had cough or fever, were collected. All of them tested negative.

Hence, there is no possibility of a person within Goa transmitting to people in and around them. Only when that happens do we need to think about changing the zoning. So even in the Centre’s database, Goa remains a Green Zone.”The health secretary announced that the department of health services is in the processes of ramping up testing capabilities to prepare for the influx of travellers in the coming week.“We now conduct an average of close to 1,200 tests daily, and this capacity can be ramped up,” she said. “We are not just proposing but have already got the approval for expanding our testing capacities by getting more machines.

With more than a dozen senior professors due to retire on May 31, the lobbying has gathered pace, said the sources.Sources said another nearly 36 professors from all government medical colleges would retire by December.However, many professors in medical colleges are opposing the retirement extension proposals saying it would lead to stagnation of promotions in many departments and prevent the entry of new talent in to the government pool.The professors, who are lobbying for retirement extension, have been continuing as heads of departments (HoD) for several years. Many specialists who joined the government services are continuing as their juniors without promotion.The previous TDP government had extended the retirement age from 60 to 63 years without consulting representatives of doctors ’ associations. Sources said the group which succeeded in getting extension of service during the TDP regime is now citing University Grants Commission (UGC) rules which prescribe 65 as retirement age for university teachers.However, experts believe that extending the retirement age might not be a wise move, particularly in the midst of a pandemic, as many veterans above the age of 55 have been relieved from emergency duties, resulting in more pressure on remaining professors.Several senior professors have gone on leave citing vulnerability to the virus. “The state government had already issued notification for recruitment of specialists on contract basis to handle Covid-19 situation. Regularising the services of freshers will be a good move rather than granting extension to the veterans,” said a professor at a government medical college.The UGC rule could be made applicable only when the state government grants pays and perks to the existing faculty in medical colleges on par with AIIMS, he said.",vijayawada,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-75936647,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-360347,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/senior-docs-lobby-to-extend-retirement-age/articleshow/75925205.cms

So, the association has appealed to the railways to provide the refund in the form of credit vouchers with validity up to March 31, 2021.

Lakhs of passengers have booked tickets through passenger reservation system (PRS) counters. Now, with the opening of PRS counters, the cash refund for cancelled trains will be a great task, it said.

Apart from credit vouchers, if the applicant has smart card or UTS App wallet, the refund amount may be credited there.

Bank details may be obtained in prescribed format along with required proof and payment may be effected to the respective account electronically, A Giri, advisor of the association and member of DRUCC, Trichy division said.

Passengers should not be advised to approach claims office with a ticket deposit receipt (TDR) for getting the refund.

Further, in order to mitigate these type of problems in the future, bank particulars may be obtained at the time of booking and all refunds can only be made electronically with suitable amendments in the booking procedures. This will enable passengers not to approach a booking counter if they opt for online cancellation, he further said.

339,['24/05/2020'],Pump snag leaves Howrah with no water,"Howrah: About 10 lakh residents of Howrah Town continued to suffer the impact of Wednesday’s cyclone, which snapped water supply in most parts of the Howrah Municipal Corporation (HMC) area. Padmapukur Waterworks, Howrah’s lone water treatment plant, broke down on Wednesday night with six of its pumps going under water.

Since Thursday, HMC engineers and workers have been trying to drain the rainwater out. They added that after the water was drained, the pumps would have to be dried. Only then can repairs start.

By Saturday morning, some of the rainwater was cleared and two of the pumps were repaired. Areas like Shibpur, central Howrah and N S Road started receiving water from Saturday afternoon itself.

Businessman Bikash Sadhu, a resident of Salkia’s Babu Danga in north Howrah, said, “We have no tap water supply or electricity since Wednesday night. We are drawing water from the tubewell and carrying buckets up to our third-floor apartment.”

In south Howrah’s Bakultala, on Andul Road, homemaker Swapna Das said, “We are reeling under a water crisis. There are no tubewells in our area, so we have to spend extra to buy bottles of mineral water.”

Private firm employee Aloke Banerjee of Mahendra Bhattacharya Road in central Howrah said, “I can’t afford to buy water and am getting it from a pond, like many of my neighbours. I’m worried after learning that some are down with stomach ailments.”

State minister Arup Roy visited Padmapukur Waterworks with HMC commissioner Dhabal Jain and engineers. “Engineers are trying to restore water supply as soon as possible. We hope Howrah residents will start getting water from Sunday night,” Roy said.

340,['24/05/2020'],GVMC to challenge Swachh star rating,"Visakhapatnam: The Greater Visakhapatnam Municipal Corporation ( GVMC ) has decided to bring the alleged discrepancies occurred during the declaration of star rating to the notice of the officials of Swachh Bharat Mission. Vizag’s rating dropped to a one-star from the last year’s two star, while Tirupati and Vijayawada retained the three-star under the ‘star rating of garbage-free cities’ initiative.

The scoring mechanism is based on the progress achieved by a certain civic body in three different indicators, namely ‘mandatory’, ‘essential’ and ‘desirable’ parameters. A certain score in ‘mandatory’ and ‘essential’ parameters is sufficient to achieve a one star. But at least 30% progress in the ‘desirable’ catalogue is required to get a three-star.

Even though the GVMC scored 84 and 70 percent in the ‘mandatory’ and ‘essential’ categories, the city was awarded zero marks in the ‘desirable’ component. It was mentioned in the report that the city failed to achieve the required score in the city level parameter ‘D3’, which deals with construction and demolition waste plant storage, segregation, processing, and recycling. But the construction and demolition plant has been in existence for the last two years.

GVMC additional commissioner V Sanyasi Rao said they would submit documents pertaining to the construction and demolition waste plant and its functioning to the Swachh Bharat Mission officials in New Delhi on May 26. “Based on the same, we request them for an upgradation of the star rating of the GVMC, which otherwise could negatively affect the city’s ranking in Swachh Survekshan 2020,” said Sanyasi Rao.

The order was issued on Friday evening and she told to join the Jalgaon hospital by Saturday. The order added that Jaiprakash Ramanand , who is currently with the Dhule civil hospital, will take charge in her place. He was the acting dean of CPR a few years ago.

Gajbhiye said she has requested the state health directorate to allow her to continue at CPR hospital. She told TOI: “I was told that a competent and full-time dean is required at Jalgaon, where the cases are on the rise. However, in Kolhapur too, the Covid cases are increasing. It will not be right to disturb the system now. Also, it is not possible for me to travel immediately. There is a lockdown and I will have to cross many districts. I will require permissions from several authorities.” Gajbhiye stayed at the CPR hospital on Saturday waiting for the revised order.

It is learnt that internal strife among the staff and administrative officials is the main reason for the transfer. She faced wrath of the nursing staff for providing poor quality PPEs and making them work for long hours.

LUCKNOW: In a stinging criticism, BSP chief Mayawati has held Congress responsible for the worst humanitarian crisis in the country, in which hundreds of migrants are being forced to walk back to their homes. She said had Congress ensured proper development and jobs in towns and villages, these workers would have never migrated to other states. Even now, she said, attempts by Congress leaders to show sympathy for migrants is mere “drama”.

Interestingly, in her most recent salvo, she totally spared the ruling party both at the Centre and state, advising them to not follow Congress’ footsteps.

In a series of attacks over the past week, including accusing Congress of playing dirty politics over buses to ferry migrants, Mayawati has said that Congress is the “real culprit for the terrible state of migrant workers”.

She said Congress was in power for several years after independence but did nothing to ensure jobs in cities and villages. “Had it made any provision for employment generation, so many people would not have been forced to move to other states,” she said.

Attacking senior Congress leaders for making a show of their sympathy for migrants, Mayawati said videos of them sitting with workers and sharing their pain looked like “drama”. While she did not name anyone, the BSP chief was apparently referring to former Congress chief Rahul Gandhi , who recently met home-bound migrant workers on Delhi-UP border.

The new norms formthe Goa government’s protocol for all those entering the state, whether Goan or otherwise.With domestic flights set to land at Goa International Airport, Dabolim, on Monday, and more trains set to chug into Goa from June 1, the state has drafted the health screening protocol to deal with the huge influx of passengers in the coming week.“The first option is to get the Covid-19 test done,” health secretary Nila Mohanan told reporters.“We will take the swab and the person has to pay Rs 2,000 to cover the cost of the test. The second option is a 14-day home quarantine, with a stamp,” she said.Thus, every individual arriving in the state will have to first undergo thermal screening at the border checkpost, railway station or airport. If the person has a fever, they will be taken for mandatory testing.Those who do not have a fever will be given the two options, which have to be indicated in a self-declaration form that has to be submitted at the entry point, the health secretary said.When asked about the possibility of a person transmitting the virus during the quarantine period, Mohanan admitted that there is a small element of risk involved, but she also pointed out that quarantining a large number of people on a daily basis is not practical.“Quarantining is a burden in terms of getting infrastructure and manpower, because a whole lot of manpower is required for it,” she said.“What we are interested in is taking their swab and testing it on the same day. We will let them go after that and if required, immediately contact them. For those who opt for testing, part of the declaration is that they will maintain in isolation till test results come.”The government said it would keep close tabs on those who opt for home quarantine, with their names shared with medical officials. These officials, along with local governing authorities and Goa police, will monitor and follow up with those quarantined at home. “At the end of the quarantine they will not be tested because that is not part of the protocol,” Mohanan said. “Through the 14 days, they will be contacted by medical officials and checked for symptoms.”A tweet by health minister Vishwajit Rane created a bit of confusion. “We shall also be relying on a Covid-19 negative certificate from a recognized laboratory for people boarding flights, from their respective state. This will help in preventing community transmission and go a long way in keeping Goa safe,” said Rane. When asked about this statement, Mohanan said, “What I have told you is the decision taken by the government, which the SEC has empowered me to share with you”.However, the protocol announced by the Goa government on Saturday will not affect expats and seafarers who are being rescued and brought back to Goa on flights or by ships, Mohanan said.Ever since the Centre announced the resumption of domestic flights, there have been questions and concerns about Goa’s protocol for passengers, and the precautions to be taken to prevent community transmission.",goa,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-75934077,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-163291,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/shell-out-rs-2k-for-covid-test-or-choose-14-day-home-quarantine/articleshow/75928270.cms

TRICHY: The banana farmers have incurred losses to the tune of Rs 6,000 crores due to the steep drop in prices and disruption in the supply chain caused by Covid-19, scientists from the National Research Centre for Banana (NRCB), Trichy , said. Director of the centre said that time has ripened to set up cluster-based banana food processing industries in major banana growing states.

The supply chain of banana was immensely affected by the coronavirus, pushed the farmers to hue and cry. The procurement prices of traditional varieties such as Nendran (Rs 10 per kg), Poovan (Rs 6 per kg) and Ney Poovan (Rs 9 per kg) have drastically decreased as a result of non-availability of workers for harvest and poor demand in the market.

“Farmers tend to have a net loss up to Rs 2 lakh per acre. Because of the steep price drop and supply chain disruption, the business has lost around Rs 6,000 crore across the country. This crash in prices is due to disruption of logistics as the main catchments such as Chennai, Bangalore, Mumbai, and Delhi are in the red zone or in containment zone where the movement of vehicles is strictly banned. In addition, there is a huge loss of Rs 200 crore in the export trade,” Dr S Uma, director, ICAR- NRCB said.

The director said that with the push from the government through infusing economy revival plan in micro food enterprises (MFE), the time has ripened to set up cluster-based banana food processing industries in major banana growing states. She emphasized that due to mishandling of the produce, about 25-40% is being wasted in the supply chain and only 2% is processed into value-added products.

It is essential to carve out innovative ways, identify gaps for capturing the market and making footprint rather than normal market channels, she said. “Creation of cross-functional convergence with development agencies, converging farmer producer organizations (FPOs), market linkages and assessment of the impact through technological incubation and cross-cutting initiatives are the primary steps for the successful establishment of the processing industry. In the end, bigger players such as ITC, Britannia, Parle-G, Horlicks, Boost, Bournvita, Pepsi, Coca Cola, Dabur should come up with the plan to utilize the banana flour, powder, puree and juices in their product portfolio to scale up the industrial use and to market it effectively”, she added.

Even before flights begin to touchdown in the state, social media platforms such as Facebook and Twitter are already rife with netizens posting pictures of their earlier holidays in Goa and discussing future plans for a “Goa trip”.Along with tourism, Goa as a destination for holiday homes or second homes has also garnered increased interest.The most obvious indicators of the demand for a Goa getaway are the thousands of netizens uploading pictures of their memories in Goa and expressing a yearning to visit the state once the lockdown is lifted.Travel blogger couple Ian and Chris shared a throwback to their holiday on Patnem beach.“Hoping to return to Goa, India, and pick up our adventures in October, if this crisis is over,” said the pair on social media.From 6.8 lakh domestic tourists in 1985, to over 70 lakh Indians marking their presence in the state in 2019, the arrival of domestic tourists has provided a more than satisfactory safety net for the tourism industry at a time when foreign tourist arrivals are declining.In 2018, 9.3 lakh foreign tourists took to the sunny shores of Goa. The 2019-20 season has proven to be a dampener with most stakeholders writing off the season as a loss.Europe has always been Goa’s main source of international tourists, whether it is the British, Germans, Scandanavians or visitors from Ukraine. Russian tourists also form a major chunk of the chartered tourist arrivals in the state that has attained a cult-like status as a tourist destination since the first hippies arrived in Goa decades ago.While international flights to Goa remain grounded, the Indian Railways and domestic airlines are all set to restart services in a calibrated manner. With travel restrictions and fear of infection ruling out vacations to international beach destinations in the forseeable future, Goa seems to be the hot favourite among Indians itching to travel after being cooped up at home.As soon as the ministry of civil aviation announced that flights would resume, a Twitter user going by the name of @sweetspotradar posted, “Are Goa hotels opening? Airbnb villas, flights from Delhi to Goa?”Similarly, an online travel blogger has listed Goa as one of the top 10 locations in the country to visit after the lockdown.Sharing a picture of his holiday at Baga, Gujarat resident Nihar K said on Twitter, “Goa’s magic never wanes.”Secretary of the Travel and Tourism Association of Goa (TTAG) Jack Sukhija said that Goa’s draw as a tourist getaway may have gotten even stronger post the pandemic.“Goa’s brand as a tourist destination has not been affected. In fact, I feel that Goa may even get enhanced as a brand. Despite being an international destination, the number of Covid-19 cases that Goa witnessed were very few, and most were from outside,” said Sukhija.He said that the present situation is an opportunity for Goa to improve its services. “This is a chance to reboot and bring in higher standards. This is a time to rejuvenate the beaches so that when we open up, we can offer better hygiene. One thing that may happen is that the people living in metros, people who are well-off and can work remotely, may look to move to Goa,” said Sukhija.Real estate firm Naik Navare seems to agree, and has launched an online promotional campaign called ‘Goa Home Buying Fest’ to try and woo customers in other states.",goa,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-75933848,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-230233,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/in-virtual-space-netizens-plan-next-holiday-to-goa/articleshow/75928311.cms

On the brighter side 12 patients were discharged from Covid hospitals across the district.The state government has given a call to restore business activity in non-containment areas as a part of relaxation measures suggested by the Union government for lockdown 4.0. Consequently, the VMC and Krishna district administration are helping small and marginal business units in non-containment areas to function again. The latter also denotified around 15 containment areas; while, the VMC is daily evaluating the list of containment areas based on reports of fresh cases. There are eight containment areas with active cases in the city now.Business establishments have welcomed the decision of the district administration and civic body to encourage trade. Many buyers could be seen at shops and establishments at Mahatma Gandhi Road and Karl Marx Road on Saturday. “Although officials relaxed the rules, we initially hesitated to open the shops fearing Covid-19. But we have opened our business units following requests from consumers. The Ramzan season is on and we are happy with the sales,” said K Bapuji, Who runs a store selling home decor items at Karl Marx Road.VMC commissioner Prasanna Venkatesh has asked VMC’s revenue wing to help local business units to start functioning. An official bulletin released by the state government confirmed one Covid-19 death in the district on Saturday.Meanwhile, the VMC has taken up the long-pending stormwater drain project at Kaleswara Rao Market junction in One Town. Roads were often inundated in the area due to congested drains. Despite the VMC taking up desilting work, the drains in the area continued being congested and clearing the stagnated water became a herculean task for civic authorities.Endowments minister Vellampalli Srinivas and VMC commissioner Prasanna Venkatesh restarted the works after lockdown came into force. “This project is very beneficial for the residents of the Old City.

355,['24/05/2020'],Green destruction may trigger microclimate change as city set to lose 5L kg oxygen a yr,"Kolkata: The widespread destruction of greenery by Amphan is likely to cause microclimate change in the city, with recurrence of heat island effects this summer. Apart from the ecological degradation, destruction of trees, which strike the delicate climatic balance, causes higher rate of surface level warming, said experts.

Even by a conservative estimate, the city will be deprived of nearly 5,00,000 kg oxygen a year, with the destruction of 5,500 trees by Amphan. Moreover, each mature tree absorbs 22 kg of carbon dioxide. “The loss is irreparable in the sense that a sapling, if planted today, will take 15 to 20 years to mature to provide the same amount of oxygen to absorb same amount of carbon dioxide,” said green crusader Bonani Kakkar.

Amphan is not the last cyclone to hit the city. With the climate crisis looming large, there will be many more such fierce cyclones. “Thus we need more resilient indigenous trees on the road side, which can withstand the blow,” said Kakkar whose organization Public had moved the HC for enforcement of National Urban Greening Guideline in the city while planting and conserving the public space greening.

“For survival, a human needs 740 kg of oxygen a year. This translates into requirement of six to seven trees per person. Kolkata has 1.5 crore population. By that logic city requires 10.5 crore mature trees. But city’s mature tree population will be a few lakhs. Thus any destruction of tree has a damaging impact on human health,” said Sudipto Bhattacharya of Saviour and Friends of Environment.

At some of the ecological hotspots like Rabindra Sarobar, Vctoria Memorial, Indian Institute of Engineering, Science and Techonolgy, Shibpore and Botanic Garden, the devastation indicates that the loss is much more than what we could conceive.

The damage at Rabindra Sarobar has been extensive. The storm has felled over 300 trees, many of them decades old and habitat of a variety of birds, both resident and migratory. The few trees that were there on the twin islands after a fungal attack led to the death of several trees around a decade ago have been flattened by the storm. Of the trees that have been lost, 200 were large trees. “The damage caused in nine hours won’t get healed in nine years. Trees that lie on the jogger’s track can be cleared within a few days. But the rest will take over a week,” said Sudhin Nandy, official in-charge of the lake of national importance.

At the garden of Victorial Memorial Hall, 14 large trees were uprooted. “Usually, the pre-monsoon storms lead to uprooting or damage of two-three trees. But this was massive. We are lucky to get away with minimal damage. We will compensate the loss with planting of 100-odd saplings,” said VMH curator Jayanta Sengupta. A preliminary estimate at IIEST says 500 trees were wiped out. At Botanic Garden, over 1,000 trees were damaged, including the Mad Tree and the centuries old Kalpa Brikshya, which are lone surviving species in the world.

356,['24/05/2020'],Uprooted signals add to traffic trouble across city,"Kolkata: More than 80 hours after cyclone Amphan disrupted several forms of infrastructure and communication, over 218 traffic signals at major crossings across the city are yet to become functional. There are more than 550 major traffic signals at important crossings, with several more on non-important ones. Several CCTV cameras set up by Kolkata Police on these signal posts, too, have been hit. This has forced cops to go manual, with multiple officers deputed at crossings to manage traffic.

As more and more offices resume operations, the number of cars and people will increase on the road. Traffic management will then get tougher. And this problem will intensify unless the signals are restored.

With several roads still blocked due to fallen trees and a jump in the number of vehicles on the road compared to the past 48 hours, the cops say their target is to get these signals up and running by Tuesday. “The fact that it is an extended weekend will help our clause,” said an officer. He said that, at present, cops are busy reclaiming the uprooted signals and ensuring repairs as quickly as possible. “Most of the signals fell due to trees. In some areas, there is still no electricity and in others, technical errors have been detected after the cyclone. But we have already got a few signals in the north and central Kolkata working,” he explained.

Cops at Tollygunge Phanri said the entire traffic signalling system at the crossing was discontinued as a portion of the signal post on the Tollygunge-bound flank of SP Mukherjee Road had collapsed. Similarly, the important signal on the Loudon Street-Theatre Road crossing is not working. At Behala, several signals on Biren Roy Road have stopped working since there is no electricity. “This is a problem we face every time there is a storm. However, this time, it is on a larger scale,” said an officer.

Bigger traffic guards, like Jorabagan, are feeling the heat. “Officially still a containment zone where several officers had to be quarantined, we have three signals which have been fully or partially uprooted and five that are not functioning properly. At all eight spots are now being operated manually,” said a source. The daily activity of the traffic guard is to monitor the major markets at Posta and Burrabazar.

On Saturday, joint commissioner of police, traffic, Santosh Pandey said major damage has been reported across Kolkata traffic police areas. Senior officers said they were worried as signal posts in major intersections in the south, including Ballygunge Circular Road and Gurusaday Dutta Road crossing, and Central Avenue and Jawaharlal Nehru Road crossing, were badly damaged. “We are ascertaining the monetary damage. Necessary action will be taken to restore the signals and cameras as soon as possible,” said an additional CP.

The city corporation has been planning to introduce online property tax payment system for many years. However, with Covid-19 and social distancing becoming the new normal, the MCC officials on Friday held a meeting to roll out a software for online property tax payment. However, it may take another month for the development of suitable software and the launch, officials said.The city corporation also expects that a large number of people will pay property tax with the government extending 5% rebate for those who are paying it in May. The government has extended the rebate till May 31 in all the urban local bodies, except the BBMP, in view of the extended lockdown. Normally rebate is given for tax payments done in April.The idea of introducing online property tax payment was mooted when Sameer Shukla became the first IAS officer to take charge as MCC commissioner in 2008. However, thereafter the city corporation could not take it forward due to technical reasons and the lockdown has yet again made them think of launching it at any cost.MCC commissioner Shanady Ajith Kumar Hegde told TOI that the work on online property tax payment system was pending due to several reasons. “We have already held a meeting to discuss about the proposal.

PONDA: The residents of Mollem in Dharbandora are apprehensive as they allege that drivers of mining trucks coming from outside the state roam around in the village.

Fearing the spread of coronavirus, panchayat members have demanded that the mining companies provide all facilities to the truck drivers inside the respective company’s premises.

Deputy sarpanch and representative of the Suktali ward, Sushant Bhagat, told TOI that mining truck drivers roam around the village in groups without wearing masks. He also claimed they spit all over. “This behaviour is bound to lead to the spread of coronavirus in our village,” he said.

Sarpanch Snehalata Naik said that at a meeting held before the transportation of the iron ore began, the mining companies concerned had agreed they would take care of the truckers.

The sarpanch also said villagers from non-mining wards are also of the opinion that except essential commodity carriages, no other transport vehicles should be allowed into the village.

LUCKNOW: Away from media glare and milling crowd of party workers, Dimple Yadav, former MP and wife of Samajwadi Party national president Akhilesh Yadav, has been distributing food and medicines among displaced migrant workers who are trekking back home or arriving in trucks stashed like cattle.

For six hours in the scorching sun, Dimple gave away food packets and other essentials to migrant labourers on Agra-Lucknow Expressway on Saturday.

Though Dimple is no longer in active politics after Akhilesh Yadav announced last year that she won’t contest again, the humanitarian streak is still alive. Moved by the plight of migrant workers, Dimple left her Vikramaditya Marg residence on Saturday morning with only two private security guards in tow, while keeping her husband in the dark about her mission.

She stopped at Agra-Lucknow Expressway and distributed food, water and medicines among migrant labourers till well past noon. She has been on this secret mission for over 10 days now and decides the itinerary on her own. When TOI contacted her, Dimple refused to divulge details on her charity work.

She’s never critical of the government while speaking to labourers, said sources. Not to be seen as indulging in politics, she works in anonymity and drives straight back home after serving the needy.

As Kannauj MP when her husband was also chief minister, Dimple headed the State Nutrition Mission to bring down the infant mortality rate in UP. Perhaps on her insistence, Akhilesh Yadav announced aid to a Lalitpur woman, who recently delivered on road and also decided to adopt the mother and child, in the same manner, he adopted “Khajanchi”, who was born in an ATM queue during demonetisation.

The Yadav couple feels the “unplanned lockdown” is another example of ill-planned policies of the BJP government. Meanwhile, a former minister in the Akhilesh Yadav government told TOI that SP workers and supporters have been distributing over 5 lakh food packets every day in parts of the state.

The plea, filed by The Gavda, Kunbi, Velip and Dhangar Federation (Gakuved), alleges that flouting of rules and conditions during transportation of ore has resulted in environmental damage. It also states that tribals living in mining affected villages have been facing hardships.

The court has posted the matter for hearing on May 28 and has asked the directorate of mines and geology and the Goa State Pollution Control Board to reply by May 26.

A division bench comprising justices M S Sonak and M S Jawalkar passed the order after the counsel for the respondents sought time to respond to the petition. It has also granted liberty to mining companies and other authorities to file a reply by May 26.

The government had sought a minimum of Rs 2,000 crore for the state as the mining and tourism industries had both come to a halt, further straining state finances.

Speaking to mediapersons, senior MGP leader Ramkrishna ‘Sudin’ Dhavalikar said that Sawant should reveal to the people of Goa the amount of aid money the state was entitled to, from the Rs 20 lakh crore financial package announced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

“After reviewing the package, I realised that there is nothing for Goa in it,” he said. Dhavalikar said that the state has been allowed to borrow Rs 4,450 crore as a loan, which is 3 per cent of the Gross State Domestic Product (GSDP).He also said the state cannot borrow this loan to pay salaries or repay pending loans, but can utilise it only for development.

“The government needs around Rs 1,000 crore to clear the bills of developmental works undertaken by various departments. The expenditure is more than the revenue of the state ,” he said.

364,['24/05/2020'],"After Corbett, 8 cameras go missing from Rajaji Tiger Reserve during lockdown","DEHRADUN: Four pairs of camera traps, installed in Rajaji Tiger Reserve (RTR) to keep a watch on wild animals and protect them from poaching, have gone missing in the past one-and-a-half months of the ongoing lockdown. This comes soon after a pair of camera traps went missing from Corbett Tiger Reserve (CTR) sometime ago.

The instances of camera traps going missing in RTR have been recorded from Motichur forest range , Haridwar forest range, Beriwala forest range, and Ramgarh forest range between the months of April and May as per RTR administration. Notably, the Chilla-Motichur corridor is one of the most sensitive and wildlife-rich zone of RTR. That camera traps have gone missing from here has raised concern among the forest officials. The camera traps were installed there for monitoring wild animals and for keeping a tab on their population.

The officials are speculating various reasons behind disappearance of these cameras. Some believe that the theft is an outcome of “personal enmity among forest staff” while others feel that this is a case of “intrusion by those forest dwellers who live close to the reserve”.

RTR warden Komal Singh told TOI, “At Beriwala, we are suspecting that Van Gujjars may have removed the cameras while entering into the forest to collect fodder for livestock and easy fuel wood. And at Ramgarh range, it is probably a deliberate act of forest staff itself. We could not find any broken pieces of camera or snapped wire in that place. It seems that cameras were removed by someone who is acquainted with the system. The cameras were removed with the help of proper equipment.”

The official added that all the four cases have been filed at RTR’s register of complaints and the nearest police station has also been apprised of the matter. However, none of the cases has yet been solved.

“We have put our teams on high alert and have increased night patrolling and ambush to avert any poaching instance in the reserve. We are looking into various angles behind cameras going missing. It may be an act of poacher or an intrusion by forest dwellers. The probe into the matter is underway. The areas are being combed rampantly and fortunately, we have been successful in preventing poaching,” said Amit Verma , RTR director.

Another RTR official requesting anonymity said that abandoned anti-poaching posts may have encouraged such crimes. “Some of our forest posts have turned into abandoned buildings, like the ones close to river Suswa in Faduvata. Consequently, even staff members do not want to be deployed there as they fear attack by leopards or elephants. This is probably why the anti-social elements are daring to pull off such crimes,” said the official.

However, Verma said that the infrastructure of RTR will be improved. “Our prime focus this year would be to get the pre-existing structures revamped rather than investing on new infrastructure,” he added.

Meanwhile, the Corbett Tiger Reserve administration has also failed to crack the case of missing camera trap pair from the reserve till now. “We haven’t found the accused yet but we continue to investigate the matter. We have got a lead though and we are hoping to crack the case soon,” said Rahul, CTR director.

Further, consignments from Gujarat , Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka are not flowing freely into Maharashtra and this, in part, could explain why local consumers are still finding many items missing from the shelves at grocery stores and online portals.Transporters said many orders have to be placed in abeyance as they do not have enough drivers to transport the goods.President of the association Baba Shinde stated, “Even though products like grains are available, some other household consumer products are in short supply despite factories starting production.

Railway authorities , however, ensured passengers maintained social distance during the journey.

Based on the feedback of passengers, TOI, in its Saturday edition, highlighted how social distancing was ignored on the first day, even when a few passengers were in the bogies. On Friday, only 63 persons travelled from Bengaluru to Mysuru , and just 59 from the other end.

A section of passengers was upset with the authorities for allotting tickets to all the three seats in the row, thereby not allowing the passengers to practise social distancing. Some passengers had also said how this would prove costly if any of them is infected.

To address those concerns, the railway authorities on Saturday ensured safe distance between the passengers. Officers were seen telling passengers to maintain safe distance by leaving the middle seat unoccupied. On their part, the passengers sat only at the two ends of the seat.

There will be no service on Sunday due to 36-hour lockdown — from 7pm on Saturday to 7am on Monday.

Priya Shetty, divisional commercial manager (Mysuru division), told STOI: “Compared to Friday, there was good response on Saturday with 183 passengers travelling from Bengaluru to Mysuru, and 194 from Mysuru to Bengaluru. We also ensured that people kept social distance from one other.”

‘Step out only if necessary’

Meanwhile, Mysuru city police commissioner Chandragupta on Saturday has directed people to observe total lockdown on Sunday.

Accordingly, permission has been given only for essential and emergency services — sale of fruits and vegetables, hospitals and clinics and ambulance service. People can go to hospitals for medical check-ups and treatments. Weddings can also be host, but with prior permission.

“Security at check-posts will be tightened,” he added.

368,['24/05/2020'],Kochi: Cash-starved corporation saddled with Ro-Ro repair costs,"The Ro-Ro vessels had resumed services on Thursday. The periodical maintenance of vessels could cost the civic... Read More

KOCHI: At a time when the Kochi Corporation is facing a financial crunch, the local body has found itself burdened with the task of funding for the periodical maintenance of its Ro-Ro vessels and for a boat plying between Fort Kochi-Vypeen, which is expected to cost close to Rs 2.25 crore.

This has come at a time when the cash balance in the corporation’s coffers was just Rs 2 crore as on May 19. The civic body will require at least Rs 11 crore for meeting its monthly operational expenses.

The dry docking of the Ro-Ro vessels, Sethusagar-1 and Sethusagar II, is scheduled to begin on June 15 and June 16, respectively. It will require at least Rs 2 crore for the purpose.

The vessels had resumed services on Thursday after a gap of two months.

In a letter sent to the corporation, Kerala Shipping & Inland Navigation Corporation Ltd (KSINC), the agency which operates the vessels on behalf of the civic body, has stated that the repair cost excludes the expense for spare parts, if they are to be replaced.

The cost of repairing Fort Queen, the boat which had been plying in Fort Kochi-Vypeen sector, is around Rs 25 lakh.

“Such expenses are going to be an additional burden for the corporation. Still, we can’t stop the services. Hundreds of people depend on them,” said K R Premakumar, deputy mayor, Kochi Corporation.

Opposition councillors blamed the lackadaisical attitude of the corporation authorities for the crisis. “It was around three years ago that the Cochin Shipyard Limited completed the construction of the two Ro-Ro vessels. The corporation authorities, who sat on the proposal to float a special purpose vehicle all through the years, have spoiled the chances of generating revenue from the service. It was after spending Rs 15 crore that the vessels and jetties were constructed,” said C K Peter, councillor from Konthuruthy division.

“A few months ago, Fort Queen, the boat which was bought for Rs 1.25 crore, was removed from Fort Kochi-Vypeen sector. Since then, it has been lying idle. Corporation authorities could have operated the boat in another sector,” Peter said.

The KSINC, which started the Ro-Ro service almost two years ago, has not handed the corporation its share profits. The agency has been citing high operational costs and claiming that it has been running into losses. “We will demand the payment. Then, we will have to mobilize the balance amount required for dry docking the vessels,” Premakumar said.

“We have asked our officials to collect tax dues from shops and establishments. Now, the daily collection is just Rs 4-5 lakh. We have just Rs 2 crore left in our coffers. We will require at least Rs 7.5 crore for paying salaries and pensions,” he said.

PRAYAGRAJ: An ancient idol of Lord Vishnu was recovered on Saturday at Rasoolpur Badagav village in Kaushambi district during digging of a pond by labourers engaged under MNREGS.

Speaking to TOI, district magistrate (Kaushambi) Manish Kumar Verma said, “we have apprised Archaeological Survey of India officials about the idol, which could hark back to the 12th century. The idol is currently in possession of the treasury department and teams of ASI and Allahabad Museum would examine it on Sunday.” SDM (Manjhanpur) Rajesh Chandra said, 150 labourers were digging khumbhi pond in Rasoolpur Badagav development block when a labourer stumbled upon the idol and alerted the village head and block development officer.

District officials rushed to the spot, took possession of the ancient idol and notified ASI officials.

According to villagers, the idol mirroring Lord Vishnu has four arms, carrying a conch, gada and chakra. Officials said, they can divulge more details after consulting archaeologists. Leaders of Hindu frontal organisations also assembled at the pond to take a glimpse of the idol and requested district authorities to install it at a temple for puja.

However, with the states allowing travel, the workers decided to leave amid fears that there would be no work for them in the coming months,” Kataria told TOI. “With many of them from agrarian families, we are aware that after the sowing season they would want to come back to work and so, we have proposed that our members fund their travel back to the state, giving them an incentive to return,” Kataria added.He further said Credai was planning to ensure decent on-site accommodation for these workers. “Our members are expecting the workers to return in July after they complete the sowing activity,” he said.Many developers said there has been no construction activity for two months and now, in the fourth phase of the Covid-19 lockdown, construction activity has resumed in some areas. “At these very places, workers had left for their hometowns,” one developer said.Workers who stayed back have complained that they were not getting enough ration and so they too were planning to go back. On Saturday, Pune district collector Naval Kishore Ram told TOI that over 1.12 lakh people have left for their hometowns, especially to the afore-mentioned states. “Most of the migrant workers staying on-site too have left after the Shramik Special trains have commenced,” Ram said.“Daily, we have been sending out 10-12 trains ferrying these workers. We will continue to send out the trains as long as there is a demand,” the collector said.Ram further added that they were issuing passes to the construction industry, which has been demanding permissions for passes for vehicles ferrying raw material, and that stone-crushing activity too has been allowed.",pune,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-75935555,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-145714,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/will-pay-for-migrants-keen-to-return-to-work-credai/articleshow/75927532.cms
373,['24/05/2020'],"Army, NDRF, forest dept help KMC clear choked roads","Kolkata: With Army, National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) and forest department teams by its side, Kolkata Municipal Corporation (KMC) on Saturday made significant progress in clearing city’s arterial roads by removing large trees that were uprooted by the super cyclone. The civic body claimed it was now in a position to clear all major thoroughfares by Sunday.

“We have set a target of clearing all major thoroughfares in the city by Sunday. Even then, we need to continue our work to clear some other roads in fringe areas during first half of next week,” a civic official said.

The Army on Saturday afternoon deployed five columns of the Kumaon Regiment to clear trees uprooted by cyclone Amphan that were blocking major roads in the city. The deployment followed an appeal for help from the state. Road-clearing equipment, such as payloaders and bulldozers, were requisitioned from the engineering units based at Fort William and the teams were sent to various locations in Tollygunge, Ballygunge, Rajarhat, New Town, Behala and Diamond Harbour. The government has made a similar appeal to the Railways, Kolkata Port Trust and the private sector for teams and equipment for the clean-up and restoration work.

“The Army columns were accompanied by NDRF personnel. Both Army and NDRF personnel were equipped with electric saws and chopped branches within minutes, allowing the heavier equipment to clear the mess. NDRF has been working in various parts of Kolkata for the past two days,” an officer added.

The state government on Saturday tweeted that it was mobilizing maximum strength in unified command mode on a 24X7 basis for immediate restoration of essential infrastructure and services ASAP. “Army support has been called for; NDRF and SDRF teams deployed; Rlys, Port & private sector too requested to supply teams and equipment,” the state home department tweeted, adding that generators were being hired where necessary and that more than 100 teams from multiple departments were working to remove fallen trees. “WBSEDCL & CESC asked to deploy maximal manpower, even while lockdown significantly affects the deployment potential of the latter. Police on high alert,” the tweet added.

NDRF said it was rushing 10 additional teams to Bengal for post-cyclone management following a written request from the state disaster management and civil defence principal secretary. The teams are expected to reach the city by late Saturday night. At present, 26 NDRF teams, including five in Kolkata, are deployed in cyclone-affected areas of the state. The forest department has deployed 30 teams — from Midnapur, Jhargram and Bankura — in Kolkata to clear the trees. Thirty more teams from Darjeeling, Kalimpong, Jalpaiguri and Alipurduar will reach Kolkata on Sunday.

The KMC parks department has roped in additional manpower from the conservancy department and workers from 100-day job scheme to remove uprooted trees from added areas like Behala, Jadavpur and Tollygunge. However, a civic official conceded that the department would need 15 days more to remove all uprooted trees from across the city.

According to a KMC official, had the civic body not faced dearth of manpower and electric saws, all trees would have been removed on the first day itself. KMC has pressed into service 17 more electric saws. “We had 50 electric saws but some proved to be non-functional. That is why we have purchased 17 more,” said a KMC parks department official.

377,['24/05/2020'],‘Silent epidemic is brewing for non-Covid patients thanks to bureaucratic approach’,"Meerut: A sudden spike in blood pressure knocked Gaurav Singh out. His family took him to six hospitals and nursing homes one after another, but none admitted him. In such a forbidding situation, however, a ray of hope for the family came when a hospital agreed to treat Gaurav but refused to admit him — the 24-year-old youth had developed a blood clot in the brain and his treatment began without admission to a hospital.

Similarly, a 70-year-old resident suffered acute abdominal pain and a phone call to a physician hardly served any purpose as there could be “a hundred reasons for the pain and that could not be diagnosed over the phone”.

Reduced access to private healthcare facilities to out-patients and denial of hospitalisation services are proving to be a medical crisis for thousands of non-Covid patients and as has been put by medical fraternity — the suffering of non-Covid patients can be ten times more serious problem than Covid ones, but the entire state machinery and policymakers are only focussed on coronavirus-related issues.

“Even after two months of lockdown, the government has permitted us to treat only emergency non-Covid patients. But, a large number of patients are suffering from rheumatoid arthritis, cardiovascular diseases, chronic diabetes, renal complications, etc, and they require regular monitoring and frequent change of medicines and their doses, but all these are not allowed. And, by not giving them proper attention, we are letting these patients enter the emergency stage,” says NK Sharma, president, Meerut chapter of Indian Medical Association (IMA).

Senior physician Dr Tanuraj Sirohi told TOI, “The problem is the bureaucratic approach. There is a communication between the government and private medical fraternity, but the approach is top-down, which means policies are drafted at the government level and being implemented on the ground without seeking medical fraternity’s opinion.”

However, the government is clear in its priorities. A senior director with the health department in Lucknow said on condition of anonymity, “We are aware of the problem, but at this juncture, the government’s entire focus is on preventing the spread of coronavirus. Because, if it goes out of control, there will be havoc. It should not be seen as insensitivity on our end, but a desperate measure to outsmart the killer virus.”

378,['24/05/2020'],Give govt some more time: CM,"Kolkata: CM Mamata Banerjee has appealed to people to bear with state agencies for some more days before power lines are restored.

“Try to understand the difficulties. We are not sitting idle. A total of 225 teams are working in Kolkata. I understand your problem. I have spoken to CESC’s Sanjiv Goenka quite a few times during the last 24 hours. CESC is a private organisation. It is not under us. They are having a manpower shortage due to lockdown,” the CM said at Nabanna on Saturday. Later in the evening, she went to Victoria House, the CESC headquarters, to speak to Goenka and the executives.

According to CESC sources, 3 lakh out of the total 35 lakh consumer base are yet to get their power supply restored. CESC has cited inadequate manpower, uprooted trees and posts and waterlogging as impediments to the restoration. Most of the CESC last-line workers are from Bihar and Uttar Pradesh who went to their home states due to lockdown. CESC is operating with 60 of the total 140 teams in the city.

The state agencies also have a manpower shortage. “We don’t have enough people to cut trees. I have told KMC chairperson Firhad Hakim and police commissioner Anuj Sharma to engage locals. The Odisha government has told me that they will be sending men to cut trees. But they can help CESC men at work. I have also urged CESC to hire 150 generators and supply water and electricity,” the CM said.

The state is procuring heavy-duty generators from Salt Lake stadium and Netaji Indoor stadium to help out CESC. “State finance minister Amit Mitra informed me that industry is arranging some heavy-duty generators,” the CM said.

379,['24/05/2020'],"Protest pockets lock down south, make commute tough","Kolkata: Demonstrations and roadblocks continued for the second day in large parts of the city, particularly in south Kolkata, as irate residents took to streets demanding restoration of power and water supply at the earliest. However, the blockades adversely affected the movement of vehicles, especially those on emergency duty, adding to the commute woes triggered by uprooted trees and lamp posts.

Aggrieved locals squatted in front of Saroj Gupta Cancer Centre and Research Institute’s (SGCCRI) gate demanding immediate restoration of power supply. The protest paralysed the hospital’s functioning as healthcare workers were not allowed to go in or come out of the hospital. Even vehicles carrying doctors were not allowed to enter the hospital. “One OT nurse was manhandled when she requested protesters that the hospital gate be spared. I had to send SOS to numerous people, including local politicians, police and administration. One can understand the anguish of the protesters but how could they hold the hospital to ransom in demand of power restoration,” said Arnab Gupta, SGCCRI medical director.

Protests turned violent and at least six persons, including two cops, were injured and a truck was set ablaze on Kalyani Expressway in the Khardah-Titagarh area. A large police contingent, including RAF and combat force, had to be deployed to bring the situation under control. Traffic came to standstill on Kalyani Expressway for over three hours.

Large areas of Behala, Tollygunge, Jadavpur and areas closer to EM Bypass went out of bounds for citizens as locals vented out their frustrations by blocking traffic, gheraoing CESC workers and even forcing them to accompany the protesters, who have been struggling without power and water for more than 72 hours.

At most places, the protesters claimed there has been an absolute no-show by government representatives and that all calls to emergency numbers were not even entertained. The protests, mostly spontaneous, hit emergency services as police, CESC, NDRF and KMC teams got stuck in them, delaying rescue operations further.

In the southern parts of the city, Behala’s Parnasree and Shakuntala Park areas turned to be protest hub. People in Behala blocked almost every possible connection between the city proper and the southernmost part of Kolkata at Joka. Blockades were put up on Diamond Harbour Road at Behala Silpara and Thakurpukur Bazar, James Long Sarani was closed between Behala Chowrasta and Kadamtala and MG Road was blocked at Badamtala crossing near James Long Sarani-MG Road connector till late in the evening since noon. Chief minister Mamata Banerjee herself rushed to different Behala localities to pacify people and assure them that electricity and water would be restored at the earliest.

“While electricity is being restored in several parts of the city, it seems like we are the most neglected. It has been four days and still we don’t have power at our homes. We will not leave the road until the power lines are restored immediately,” said Bibhas Halder, a resident of Silpara. “It has been three days that we have been moving from the CESC offices at Taratala and Budge Budge. They are saying KMC will do the job. Police are saying CESC will do the job. For three days now, my 80-year-old father-in-law is suffering. Where is the administration, why can’t they work simultaneously?” fumed Sayoni Patra, an IT executive who stays in Sector V.

At the protest zones, people used whatever they could lay their hands on to block the road — from police guardrails, fallen tree branches and heaps of sand and bricks to even damaged and battered store hoardings and glow sign boards. “I had to reach office today for a very important meeting but in spite of several attempts for over four hours, the office car couldn’t leave Behala. Finally, I had to return home, where I obviously don’t have any power or internet connectivity,” said Rahul Basu, a resident of Thakurpukur

Back in Jadavpur and Tollygunge, roadblocks were reported from Garfa’s Sapuipara and Jadavpur Sulekha crossing. The local CESC office was gheraoed. Protests were also reported from Jadavpur’s Mondalpara and Santoshpur Jorabridge. The multiple protests halted traffic movements towards EM Bypass.

Bratati Roy and Piyush Roy, senior citizens from Survey Park, were on their way to a pathological lab in Jodhpur Park for some tests and was then scheduled to meet a doctor at AMRI Hospital. “We, too, have borne the burnt of Amphan. But if you keep blocking the emergency workers, you are only delaying the help coming to you. It is a major natural disaster and everyone needs to put the best foot forward,”stated Bratati Roy.

Agitators also put up road blockades at different places in Dum Dum, demanding immediate restoration of electricity and water.

Youngsters are introducing their parents to OTT platforms and the new age content that they offer while Generation X , those born between between 1965-79, are using it to reminisce about the hit shows of the 90s .

Souvik Ghosh, a 25-year-old IT professional, said, “As a child, we would get ready to sit down to eat dinner in the hall in front of the television to watch Zubaan Sambhal Ke . It was about a group of adult students learning spoken English, and it was hilarious. We found the show online and my parents and I have started binge watching it again.”

My mother used to watch these shows, but I don’t remember it. Now, we have started watching it together and I am enjoying it. I was surprised to find many catchphrases used in these shows that are so contemporary, and many others that I’m going to add to my vocabulary to help them make a comeback,” she said. Her mother also found shows like Sex and the City, but Ananya said she can’t watch it with her because of the innuendos. “Even though I’m an adult, it is awkward. But I’ve watched some episodes and also got hooked to it,” she added.

The classic sitcoms about “nothing” — Seinfeld — is another hit with the youngsters.

“Everything has a theory behind it in the show and there’s a term for everything. I like the show so much that I’ve started following the meme pages on social media dedicated to it, and I keep tagging my dad on them.

KOCHI: The construction of Vyttila and Kundannoor flyovers are progressing well and the Road and Bridges Corporation-Kerala (RBDCK) expects that the two big-ticket projects would be over by June 30. The construction work gained momentum after regulations of lockdown were eased down.

RBDCK managing director R Rahul said, ""Rain is a major concern. It might cause some delay in tarring work. If not for the rain, we expect to finish the work within the targeted time."" He said there are no issues related to availability of construction materials or labour force.

Regarding quality tests, he said such checking are being carried out at various stages of construction and there would be no compromise on the aspect. On a question on the need for carrying out load testing on these two flyovers, Rahul said the state government will take a final decision on it.

Regarding fund flow, he said there is sufficient funds for projects that are being executed through Kerala infrastructure investment fund board (KIIFB). ""Once bills are submitted, KIIFB will release 75 % of funds,"" said Rahul.

RBDCK also maintained that plans for construction of road over bridges (ROB) at Vaduthala and Atlantis are also progressing. Construction work can begin once district administration completes land acquisition process. The Indian Railways follow stringent standards of construction, and hence, it will not be possible to get railway’s approval without submitting definite plans.

The construction of Vathuruthy ROB is another project that is yet to begin construction in the city. In January 2020, Ernakulam MP Hibi Eden had said issues related to implementation of the ROB was being resolved and that the railway has given an in-principle approval for the clearance of the project.

The ROBs at Vaduthala, Atlantis and Vathuruthy are expected to ease down traffic movement through the city.

The outbreak of the novel coronavirus and the consequent lockdown had put on hold VMRDA ’s work.

Now, VMRDA officials are brainstorming on what the urban development body can do to turn the tide. Work for the NAD Flyover and other select development works have already begun over the last few days. However, shortage of labour and other logistical problems remain and may continue for a few more months.

Speaking to TOI, VMRDA metropolitan commissioner P Koteswara Rao said that the body is in the process of identifying priority areas to play a larger role in the development of the region, both during and after the lockdown. The urban development body is also looking for ways to increase revenue.

“The upper rotary works from the airport to the city, which were supposed to be completed in March, will be finished within the next one week. VMRDA wants to make the most of the low traffic during the lockdown period and speed up the flyover works,” Koteswara Rao added.

The VMRDA had conducted an open design competition for the planetarium in Kailasagiri and invited entries from architects and architectural firms from across country. The metropolitan commissioner said that the top three entries of the ‘conceptual design competition’ will be finalised within the next week.

Further, chief minister YS Jaganmohan Reddy had laid foundation stones for around Rs 380 crore worth of works in December 2019. The VMRDA is currently in the process of taking these works forward. While tenders for a few projects have been finalised, others are still at the planning stage. Works on the Kailasagiri Hilltop Park renovation is expected to begin in the next few weeks.

384,['24/05/2020'],Pune: Six senate members take on move to cancel exams,"PUNE: A group of senate members from Savitribai Phule Pune University ( SPPU ) have opposed the state government’s request to the University Grants Commission ( UGC ) to cancel the final year exam.

The members have demanded a senate meeting through a videoconference to discuss the matter, rather than making a hasty decision. They pointed out that students work harder in the final year as the mark sheets are considered for higher education as well as jobs and cancelling the exams will be unfair to them.

The senate members also reasoned that if the exams are cancelled, there is a risk of this batch being labelled as the ‘corona-batch’ and the gradation process may affect their opportunities while applying for jobs or seeking admission to foreign universities.

One of the senate members Shamkant Deshmukh said, “If you conduct random sampling, you can see that most students score best in their last year. This is because they know their score in the last year reflects in the degree certificate that is used to apply for higher studies or jobs. Secondly, many job opportunities come with an average 60% marks rider. So even if a students has scored about 58% till the penultimate year, s/he can study hard and score a higher percentage in the final year so that the average is above 60%.”

Deshmukh added that postgraduate (PG) students, many of whom want to take up teaching as a career, may also be affected and class improvement schemes are generally not a good idea for most students.Another official said that class improvement is also not a viable option as students have to appear for exams in at least three subjects and when there is a gap in education, the results are usually not very good.

Meanwhile, UGC vice-chairman Bhushan Patwardhan said, “UGC has issued clear guidelines. The universities are free to devise suitable mechanisms to evaluate and grade students. This may be done based on the local situation keeping in view academic requirements and in the best interest of students’ future.”

The Corporation of the City of Panaji (CCP) has come down heavily on the vendors and their staff for blatantly spitting inside the market complex building despite the Covid-19 guidelines advising against the act.

The complex was closed for six weeks owing to the lockdown imposed to slow the spread of coronavirus.

During this time, the CCP workers had washed out the paan stains, cleaned the toilets and disinfected the entire building. When the complex opened on May 7, it was with a warning to shop owners to avoid spitting and by imposing a ban on the use of chewable tobacco.

However, over the past week, CCP inspectors posted at the premises noticed vendors and their staff violating the rules. Shop numbers of people suspected of chewing tobacco and spitting inside the premises were noted by Thursday, following which they were prohibited from entering the premises on Friday and Saturday.

In a strict warning, Panaji mayor Uday Madkaikar has asked the violators to clean their own mess.

“They have been caught red handed with the tobacco products. They will not be allowed to enter till Monday. On Tuesday, we will take an undertaking from them that if they are found spitting again, their shops will be forced shut again,” he said.

MEERUT: A group of Nepali migrants representing families stranded here met Saharanpur district magistrate Akhilesh Singh and requested the latter to arrange transportation for them so that they could go home to the Himalayan country .

The delegation submitted a list of over 150 Nepali migrants who requested for arrangements to be made for their journey back home. Authorities have approved the plea and assured them that the transportation arrangement will be made over next two days.

This comes amid the ongoing border dispute between the two countries after Nepal approved the new political map showing border areas of Lipulekh, Kalapani and Limpiyadhara as its territory. The move was seen as Nepal's retaliation to India's newly inaugurated road linking Lipulekh pass and Dharchula in Uttarakhand.

Meanwhile, speaking to media, stranded Nepali migrants claim that they have started running out of money and ration and now want to get back to their native place in Nepal.

“We are about 150-200 people. We don’t have enough money and our resources, including ration, are drying up. As of now, we don't have a clue how we would even sustain, let alone managing our journey back home,"" Pasang Tamang, a Nepali resident, said.

Responding to their plea, Saharanpur DM Akhilesh Singh said that buses will be arranged in the next two days and it will drop the Nepali migrants at the bordering district of Bahraich.

“Will speak to Bahraich DM and request him to facilitate onward transportation of the migrants to their native place by coordinating with local officials in Nepal,” the Saharanpur DM said.

The 11 areas with high case-load are in seven states - Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Gujarat, Delhi, Madhya Pradesh, West Bengal and Rajasthan.

In a review meeting with senior authorities of these areas, the health ministry asked them to be mindful of ramping up health infrastructure to ensure preparedness for the next two months and maintain high vigilance in old cities, urban slums and other high density pockets.

""It was told that the major challenge lies in those corporations having shorter doubling time, higher mortality rate and a higher confirmation rate than the national average,"" the health ministry said in a statement after the meeting.

The areas were briefed about the factors to be considered while mapping containment and buffer zones; activities mandated in containment zone, active search for cases through house-to-house surveillance, contact tracing, testing protocol, clinical management of active cases, etc, the ministry said.

398,['24/05/2020'],KSINC pins hope on year-end season,"Kochi: The Kerala State Inland Navigation Corporation (KSINC) is pinning hopes on the months of November-December for revival. The agency which operates barges and vessels said that they suffered huge losses during the lockdown period. “The average loss in operating profit is Rs 1 crore for the months of April and May. In fact, our vessels had bulk bookings during the March-May period. All these bookings are cancelled. It is tough times ahead,” said KSINC commercial manager Cyril Abraham.

KSINC is focused on barge operations and operates cruise vessels like Nefertitti and Sagararani. Though operations of cruise vessels have come to a complete halt, the barges have resumed operations. KSNIC operates seven barges. Though commercial operations of barges have resumed, those organizations like FACT are working in a limited way. “All we could do was engage in barge movement for IOC during the lockdown period. This brought in roughly Rs 6 lakh,” he added. Unless international trade catches up, the movement of cargo vessels will remain limited.

KSINC does brisk business during summer holidays when schoolchildren go for vacations. The school schedules have changed, and tour programmes are also expected to change accordingly. Hence, KSNIC will have to wait for Christmas and New Year seasons to revive their businesses.

However, the shipping corporation’s revival plans are largely related to the simulation that tourism industry receives. As Covid-19 continues to remain as a threat, people are largely confined to their homes. As travel plans are limited to essential needs, tourism sector has very little hope.

KSINC, which incurred a loss of Rs 98 lakh in 2018-19, for the first time since its inception recorded a profit of Rs 1 crore in 2019-20.

399,['24/05/2020'],TTD disposed of 42 of its properties across southern states since 2002,"Tirupati: The Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams ( TTD ), between 2002 and 2020, has disposed of 42 properties spread across Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Telangana and Karnataka, as per its own records.

TTD officials say disposal of ‘unviable’ properties is within the right of the trust board and is as per endowment rules. “The TTD board is competent to sell, exchange or mortgage its immovable properties , if it is considered that the transaction is necessary or beneficial to the temple and is consistent with the objective of the TTD,” the official said.

The AP government too, through a GO (Ms 405) in July 2002, issued certain guidelines for disposal of endowment properties.

“Vacant urban properties which are not of immediate use for the expansion of the institution and are difficult to protect may be disposed of through public auction,” the GO read.

Though writ petitions were filed in the high court to set aside the government order, TTD managed to dispose of 42 properties spread across four southern states — 27 properties in Andhra Pradesh, 10 in Tamil Nadu, four in Karnataka and one in Telangana — through interim orders.

The temple body’s law officer, whose opinion was sought over the proposed disposal of TTD’s properties, said the writ petition in the high court is only related to the endowments department. “TTD is not a party in the petition. The high court, in its interim order, stated that prior permission needs to be obtained before alienation of endowment property. But in this case, the properties belong to TTD, so it’s not mandatory to seek permission from the high court,” he said.

Meanwhile, TTD estate officer V Devedra Reddy has constituted two teams to alienate around 26 properties owned by TTD in Tamil Nadu. Most of these properties, which include house sites, buildings and agricultural lands, were donated by Lord Venkateswara’s devotees over the years.

The properties are spread across Kanchipuram, Vellore, Tiruvallur, Trichy, Tiruvannamalai, Dharmapuri, Kanchipuram and Villupuram districts of Tamil Nadu. The total upset value of the 26 odd properties has been estimated at Rs 1,54,11,256, which would be disposed of through public auction.

400,['24/05/2020'],CSML resumes stalled Smart City projects,"Kochi: Many Smart City projects which were stalled due to lockdown over the outbreak of Covid-19 have resumed in Kochi.

Cochin Smart Mission Ltd (CSML) has already started road work and hospital development projects while more works are expected to begin in the coming days.

CSML authorities had initiated measures to resume work last month and contractors were asked to mobilize equipment and labourers for the purpose. “Work on many roads, including Shanmugham Road and Abraham Madamackal Road have already been started. Construction of new blocks at Ernakulam general hospital, Mattancherry taluk hospital and Karuvelippady taluk hospital have also been resumed,” an official with CSML said.

There is shortage of workers which stands in the way of the work gaining complete momentum. “Contractors have mobilized as much guest workers as possible. So, many of the projects like the work on hospital renovation are progressing well,” the official added.

However, there is no clarity on revising deadline of Smart City projects. In fact, the deadline for beginning the work was December 31, 2019. There were expectations that the Centre will grant an extension until March 31, 2020. “Government hasn’t given any written communication regarding the extension. The only instructions we got is that all work should be tendered by March 31, 2020. We have tendered almost all the work except the slum eradication one. The project for slum eradication is yet to get the clearance from Kochi corporation,” the official said.

“Similarly, the proposal to take over the work on first tower of the apartment complex being constructed by Kochi Corporation under Rajiv Awas Yojana also is yet to get government nod,” the official said.

At the same time, some of the key projects are still entangled in controversies. Due to protests from local residents, CSML authorities are unable to go ahead with vacuum sewer project in West Kochi. The sewage project aims at collecting and treating sewage from all the households and other establishments in five divisions of Kochi corporation at Mattancherry and Fort Kochi areas.

Ernakulam market renovation, a Rs 100 crore project, is another project which couldn’t be started due to disputes. The land identified for rehabilitating the merchants from the market is entangled in a legal dispute.

Meanwhile, as CSML resumed works, controversies too have stated resurfacing. “Road works are not in compliance with the norms for protecting heritage areas. The CSML is relaying most of the roads in Fort Kochi and Mattancherry using concrete. But, they should not have concreted the roads in heritage areas like Fort Kochi and Mattancherry,” said K J Sohan, former mayor, Kochi corporation

Spread on 375 acres in the middle of twin cities, the lake is a prime water source. It has not been dredged in the last 42 years, but was only desilted in 1978, when the lake had completely dried due to severe drought. HDMC’s plans to dredge the lake in 2011-12 could not materialise, said senior officials.

According to sources, exact details on the water-holding capacity of the lake, its depth and accumulation of sediment are not known to the administration. To get all these details, a bathemetry survey has been launched.

Hubballi-Dharwad Smart City Ltd, under its City Investments to Innovate, Integrate and Sustain programme, has roped in a Mangaluru-based company to do the survey at a cost of Rs 4.6 lakh.

HDSCL special officer S H Naregal told STOI that this the first-of-its-kind exercise in north Karnataka. “Based on the survey report, the government may take a call on dredging the lake,” he said, adding the survey will be completed in the next one or two days. HDSCL is planning to develop the lake, and the study will help in conserving the lake’s aquatic feature, he added.

403,['24/05/2020'],Powerlooms in Malegaon’s red zones allowed to operate,"No powerlooms will be operational in containment zones

NASHIK: The state government has allowed the powerlooms and handlooms in the textile town of Malegaon to begin operations , including red zones, except for the containment zones .

“The decision to this effect was taken by the state government on Thursday. This would provide much relief to the people of the textile town where maximum residents are dependent on the looms,” Collector of Nashik Suraj Mandhare said.

Malegaon is a densely populated city with maximum number of people directly dependent upon the powerlooms, besides plastic industries. However, due to lockdown , most people had lost their jobs.

Now with the relaxation in lockdown rules, the state government has allowed the powerlooms in the district to operate, except for the containment areas in Malegaon. Also, the government guidelines state that those working in these powerlooms and handlooms must follow social distancing, among other norms. The powerloom operators have also been directed to look after the workers as well as the infrastructure.

“The clearance to restart powerlooms and handlooms is given on the condition that the operators will ensure that social distancing and cleanliness is followed. Also, no worker from the containment areas will be employed as of now,” Mandhare added.

A meeting to this effect was held between the collector and the powerloom owners/operators in which they were briefed about all the rules and regulations to be followed.

404,['24/05/2020'],Periyar remains polluted: Report,"Kochi: A report by the irrigation department on water samples collected at Pathalam in Eloor-Edayar belt shows high levels of contamination in Periyar. Samples were collected during the initial days of easing of lockdown when industries had opened.

The test results revealed that out of the seven samples collected from upstream side of Pathalam regulator-cum-bridge, four had extremely high values for electrical conductivity (EC, total dissolved solids (TDS), total hardness, magnesium, chloride and sulphate and failed to comply with drinking water specifications of the Bureau of Indian standards (BIS).

TDS value is more than 25 times the acceptable limit and chloride content in the sample is more than 35 times the acceptable limit. There was no dissolved oxygen (DO) content in the samples, it said.

Three samples indicated high level of turbidity in the water. The pollutants were seen in the waters even after opening of shutters but further downstream, as the waters mixed up, the water quality standards were in acceptable limits.

The report said water pollution was more on the right bank of the regulator bridge.

One of the reasons for unusual fish kill was the depletion of DO levels. DO values less than 3 mg/l generally affect the existence of aquatic organisms. But out of the seven samples analysed, only one sample showed no DO content while the rest of the samples had DO above 4 mg/l.

When the water quality was measured for irrigation standards, samples proved that the quality standards were not up to required levels. Of the seven samples, each sample had one or the other value excess, including sodium absorption ratio and residual sodium carbonate.

Following media reports on visible changes in the Periyar river waters at Pathalam, the high court had taken suo motu cognizance of the issue and asked for reports from authorities, including district administration, irrigation department and pollution control board.

406,['24/05/2020'],Forest dept readying plan to relocate tribal hamlet out of the woods,"MYSURU: Officials of the Male Mahadeshwara (MM) Hills Wildlife Sanctuary forest department are currently in the process of chalking out a comprehensive plan to relocate more than 225 families from Chengadi village . All residents of the hamlet are members of the Soliga tribe , and the foresters are conferring with them to ensure that the relocation of the village – the first-of-its-kind operation in Chamarajanagar district – is carried out with their consent.

The tribal hamlet, with a population of 1,562, is nestled deep inside the MM Hills forest, completely cut-off from the world. No roads connect the residents to nearby towns and villages, and there is no electricity or means to supply power to such a remote location. The government has offered the residents a choice – they can either opt to relocate to Kothanuru, where a 400-acre land parcel has been identified and three-acre plots allotted to each household, or take Rs 15 lakh in cash.

Chengadi is not the only isolated tribal hamlet in the range. A forest officer said that Thokkere, Doddane, Medugalane and Parasnatha are four other hamlets situated deep in the woods.

“Around 90% of the people have consented to relocate, and we are trying to convince the others. Most of the people in the hamlet have either migrated to Mysuru and Bengaluru in search of employment or are living in Kollegal, Chowdalli and Hanuru, where they are engaged in agriculture. But all of them still have houses in Chengadi, and are entitled to compensation,” the officer told TOI.

He added that a bulk of the people still residing in the hamlet were the elderly. “The youngsters have moved to cities and towns. We expect that most people will accept the Rs 15 lakh package since it will help them settle down,” he said.

The survey being carried out by the forest department primarily entails identifying and demarcating land that will be allotted to those opting for plots, and the number of houses that will have to be constructed to house the families.

MM Hills wildlife sanctuary deputy conservator of forests V Yedukondalu said that a blueprint for the relocation of the entire village would be ready in two months. “We will have to prepare a report with an exact estimate of the funds required for the operation, and other logistical details. Once the finance department releases the funds required, we will initiate the process,” Yedukondalu told TOI.

He said that the forest department would look into relocation of the other four tribal hamlets once all the people at Chengadi had been duly compensated.

407,['24/05/2020'],Small-scale fishers thrive under new pricing system,"Kochi: Harbour management societies floated to regulate buying and selling of fishes by adhering to social distancing norms has ensured fair price for traditional fishers who were at the mercy of middlemen known as ‘Tharakans’ and retailers who hold the sway when it comes to fixing the value of day's catch.

Though these management societies comprised of representatives of all stakeholders including boat owners, middlemen, retailers, and fishers are considered temporary, the lessons learned from it would be useful in the future to enact laws governing fish auctions, officials said.

“Traditional fishers with small boats are now getting a base price fixed by the management society. Earlier, if the catch was abundant this was quite difficult and the prices would drop,” says P V Jayan, Ernakulam district secretary of Paramparagatha Matsya Thozhilali Samithi.

While the system is working well, the Tharakans and retailers are not quite happy with it because it has tinkered with their ability to maximize the profit. “The earlier system was better. Retailers and boat owners are asking when this would come to end. Not all fish retailers cannot enter the harbour because of the restrictions,” said Girish Kumar, who works as an agent. It is the Tharakans who finance the boats and this credit dependence fishers have on them gives middlemen a huge advantage.

The Samithi is aware of the limitations of the system in the absence of a cold chain infrastructure. “The fisheries minister has promised that they would enact a law that ensures fishers are not exploited but cold storage facilities are crucial. Matysafed would be buying from the fishers if the middlemen and retailers quote below the base price but if this is to be realised they need to build storage infra,” said Jayan.

A study paper titled 'Empowerment of Kerala’s fishermen: Need for change in the role of Matsyafed’ by Sara John and Nimmish Sany had found that lack of storage facilities is one of the major reasons for wide fluctuation of the price of fish.

“For the small boats, it is a good deal. But we are not sure how long this would continue. The department has asked for a report from the CMFRI and this needs to be discussed in various levels by all stakeholders. Currently, the credit is provided by middlemen. There is the question of who will substitute this credit,” said Maja Jose, deputy director, fisheries, Ernakulam.

TOI did a reality check on Saturday to find that citizens are not adhering to the lockown norms making the state capital vulnerable for Covid-19.

In order to ease the life of the citizens, the district administration has allowed several facilities to open in 6 sectors — Kolar, BHEL, Ratibad, Hoshangabad road, Bairagarh. However, problems were witnessed in Kolar, BHEL and Bairagarh where situation is alarming after several failed to adhere to the norms.

Such is the situation in BHEL area that markets in morning and evening are full. “This is a bad situation. People are not understanding that their such attitude can make Bhopal a ticking bomb. Administration has given them permission but even not wearing mask is somewhat is not acceptable,” said Hari Narayan Mishra, a retired govt employee. Major markets of grocery, hardware and eateries in BHEL area (Vijay market, Piplani and Indrapuri) have been opened.

Situation is worse on Kolar road where people could be seen loitering in several locations. Few shopkeepers tried to get the physical distancing done infront of their shops but citizens refused to follow them. When TOI team visited areas in Kolar, people could be seen arguing with the shokeepers. A shopkeeper Vinod Jaiswal said, “I asked the customers to keep a distance and wear masks while purchasing products my shop they found it better to buy from somewhere else. I am fine not selling anything but I can’t allow anyone to challenge guidelines as it is the safety of my family also,” said Jaiswal.

Locations near Lalita Nagar were also found same where both shopkeepers and fruit sellers were spotted selling products without wearing mask. “Has the corona left Bhopal?” asked Sudhira Yadav , reacted a resident of Kolar. He added that it is the responsibility of every citizen whether he is a businessesman or a customer that this is high time for us and such attiy will lend up everyone in trouble,” said Yadav. At Hoshangabad road also appearance of people without following the safety norms. People were seen not wearing mask inside the Barkatullah University which is one the major campuses at Hoshangabad road. Bairagarh which is a walled area and one of the trading centres in Bhopal also failed to follow norms. Major concern of Bairagarh are Chanchal square, Station area and Premrai Chand road where people come out in large number not even wearing mask. When people were asked about it their justification were hilarious.

Notably, realising the situation district administration has refused to open saloo s and beauty parlours. Important work related to construction, automobile, eateries, hardware and such other have been allowed to open for public since past three days in Lockdown-4.

While there has been opposition to this move from some quarters, the proposed amendment is unlikely to have any impact on Byadagi chilli market, one of Asia’s biggest markets.

Good infrastructure, facilities for buyers and sellers, business connectivity and other reasons will help the historic chilli market to sustain, say experts. “Chilli farmers and buyers heavily depend on Byadagi market because of the infrastructure it offers. So the new APMC amendment will not affect our market. Commission agents, traders, buyers, and farmers need not worry,” said joint director of Byadagi APMC Somashekhar Nyamagouda .

Ravi Menasinakai, vice president of KCCI, expressed apprehensions that the proposed amendment to the APMC Act will affect the existing APMCs and render many people jobless. “Private APMCs can be set up by businessmen according to the new amendment. In that case, government APMCs will be unable to compete with private yards. This will drastically affect the existing APMCs and the dependants will become jobless. “The state and the Union governments need to reconsider the decision in this regard,” he opined.

“Without APMCs, farmers will not get competitive prices for their produce. Moreover, the government will lose revenue because cess cannot be collected according to the new amendment. The government must withdraw this ordinance,” said FKCC director PD Shiruru.

The court said that the lack of critical care is apparent at the largest hospital in Ahmedabad, and had some pointed questions for the health minister.After hearing about the condition of patients and fatalities at Civil Hospital, the bench of Justice J B Pardiwala and Justice I J Vora said, “It is very distressing to note that most of the patients in the Civil Hospital are dying after four days or more of treatment. This indicates complete lack of critical care.”The high court discussed an anonymous letter sent by a resident doctor describing the sorry state of affairs at the hospital. “The Civil Hospital is meant to treat patients. However, it appears that as on date, it is as good as a dungeon,” the HC observed. “Maybe even worst than a dungeon. Unfortunately, the poor and helpless patients have no option.”The HC further said that though the patients admitted to Civil Hospital are poor, their lives too are invaluable and need to be protected.

HYDERABAD: Demanding that the state government pay full salary for May and clear the deferred salaries of March and April, members of Telangana state employees , teachers , pensioners and contract employees ’ ikya vedika on Saturday staged a protest.

The members wore black badges and held placards at their homes to show their dissent.

“Lockdown restrictions are lifted in several places. Organisations started working with 100% staff and businesses have resumed which, in turn, has a positive impact on the financial condition of the state. However, the government is still imposing salary cuts,” said Chava Ravi, general secretary, Telangana State United Teachers Federation (TSUTF).

Teachers and employees said it has become difficult for them to manage their expenses lately with 50% of salaries.

They asked the chief minister to intervene and issue orders so they get their full pay along with the arrears.

MYSURU: In what could provide major relief to over two lakh property taxpayers, the Mysuru City Corporation may extend the 5% tax rebate for two more months.

Due to the lockdown , most citizens were unable to utilize the tax rebate extended by the government till May 31. The MCC has decided to write to the government to further extend the scheme for another two months, MCC commissioner Gurudatta Hegde told TOI.

The MCC has not been able to collect taxes in all its nine zonal offices as they have remained closed during the lockdown. Even the online collection system was not implemented as planned by the MCC as there was no approval from the government, delay in computerization of all properties and other teething problems.

“MCC had discussed the issue of extending this tax benefit with corporators, finance and taxation standing committee members and decided to ask the government for an extension for another two months,” said sources.

MCC had collected Rs 126 core property tax against the targeted Rs 157 crore in the last fiscal.

The woman was also thrashed, her hair chopped, face blackened and her hands tied with a rope though she pleaded innocence.

While an FIR was lodged against 20 women and other unidentified persons, police arrested five accused on Saturday. Raids are on to nab the others, police said.

Soon after receiving information, Bermo assistant superintendent of police Anjani Anjan rushed with a team to rescue the victim amid resistance from locals. Bokaro SP Chandan Kumar Jha said that majority of the accused are members of a local mahila samiti. Jha said, “An FIR has been lodged against 20 women and other unidentified persons and strict action will be taken against all the culprits.”

Anjan added, “We lodged a case under Sections 147, 149, 323, 354, 354(b), 500, 504, 506, 341 and 342 of the IPC. Five persons have been arrested and raids are on to arrest the others.”

According to the ASP, one of the victim’s in-laws, who stays in the neighbourhood, is the prime accused. “There is a dispute between the woman and the victim over some petty issues,” said Anjan.

The victim is a mother of two and her husband works at a private organisation. On Friday, a group of women barged into the couple’s home and dragged the woman out, alleging that she was involved in an illicit relationship. “Even before the lady could speak, the mob resorted to inhumane behaviour with her,” said a cop on condition of anonymity.

Trade unions and other political parties allowed the body of the deceased to be taken away only after the management of the manpower company agreed to provide a job to his widow and announced a compensation of Rs 4 lakh.

Assistant general manager of the colliery, Ajay Kumar, said, “We had announced a compensation and job for Alam’s widow Faizia Tasleem (28) during the night itself, but the trade union leaders did not allow us to pick up the body demanding compensation from the contract firm. They later conceded only after the contract firm agreed to pay Rs 4 lakh as compensation.”

Chief general manager of the colliery A K Roy said, “The worker, Mahtab Alam (37), had gone to the 12th seam of the longwal panel of the deep mine along with four other workers around 8.40pm and found the mine’s chimney blocked with chunks of coal. Alam tried to clean the chimney with a rod when he slipped and fell into the chimney.”

He added, “Before others could understand what happened, Alam came down the chimney along with the clogged coal and fell on the chute and got buried under tons of coal and died on the spot. When the other workers raised an alarm, officials rushed to the mine. His body was retrieved from the debris only at 1am.” Alam was reportedly not wearing a safety belt at the time of the accident.

AHMEDABAD: Gujarat ATS on Saturday arrested one Babu Solanki , currently based in Mumbai and hailing from Unjha in Mehsana. Solanki was wanted in a gang war case registered by Gujarat ATS in 2006. He had been on the run for 14 years.

Solanki was arrested on Saturday from Adalaj-Mehsana Road. ATS officials said that Solanki used to work for one Sharifkhan Pathan, a right hand man of Dawood Ibrahim , supposedly based in Pakistan.

According to ATS sources, in 2006, a duo, Nilesh Shah and Jigar Choksi, had sold off shares of Pragnesh Patel who used to work in Gayatri Investment in Unjha.

“The duo did not pay Rs 10 crore to Patel. Patel then contacted Babu Solanki alias Raju and an alleged ISI agent Sabirmiya Abbasmiya Sipai. Patel gave them the contract to recover Rs 10 crore from Shah and Choksi. Patel promised Solanki and Sipai Rs 3 crore for recovery,” said an ATS official.

On the other hand, Shah and Choksi hired Mohammed Atik alias Jehangir and Iqbal Patel to take on Solanki and Sipai .

In 2006, the cops arrested Sipai with a country-made pistol and five cartridges, Mohammed Atik alias Jehangir with one revolver and seven live cartridges. They were booked for carrying weapons.

DIG, ATS, Himanshu Shukla said that since then Solanki was on the run and had fled to Mumbai where he worked as a bodyguard. “He has been booked and arrested in several offences in different police stations of the state,” said Shukla.

ATS sources said in 2006, he was booked by Gujarat ATS for extortion. In 2008, he was booked for involvement in a Rs 32 lakh angadia loot.

In 1996, he was arrested in Mumbai for attempt to murder, in 2015 he was wanted in a robbery case in Siddhpur and in 2019, he was booked for impersonating a police official.

420,['24/05/2020'],"3 lakh people under quarantine in Jharkhand, but testing rate dismal","Kolkata/Ranchi: Of the 3 lakh migrants who have arrived in the state from various parts of the country on trains, buses, trucks, cars bikes and cycles since May 1, less than 20,000 of them have been tested Covid-19. Meanwhile, the number of people under home and institutional quarantine has soared to almost 3 lakh in the last 10 days

The Jharkhand government on Friday said only 19,686 (6.6%) of the returning migrants have been tested and 168 of them have tested positive for the virus as of May 22. A total of 43,988 samples were tested in the state till Friday. As of Friday, migrants labourers constituted about 90% of the 211 active cases in Jharkhand. Of the 24 districts in Jharkhand, all barring Khunti, Pakur and Sahebganj have reported Covid cases.

With the influx of migrants, the number of people under home and institutional quarantine is now close to 3 lakh in a state which 330 Covid cases. The number of people in institutional quarantine centres rose seven-fold from 10,304 to 73,039 and those in home quarantine doubled from 1.11 lakh to over 2.25 lakh in the last 10 days.

Addressing a press conference on Friday evening, health department principal secretary Nitin Kulkarni, said, “We all know that it is not possible to test all the migrants workers returning home. Among those who returned from Mumbai, 9,378 were tested and 99 — a little more than 1% — were found to be infected. Similarly, we have tested 3,000 workers from Surat and 0.86% were found positive. A bulk of the other patients are from Chhattisgarh, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka and Bengal among others.”

Nodal officer for inter-state travel, principal secretary AP Singh said a total of 200 trains – including Shramik specials and Rajdhanis — arrived in the state between May 1 and May 22. On reaching their home districts, the passengers are sent to institutional or home quarantine. Such centres have been set up at schools and other government buildings at almost every village and blocks.

The state government is at present focussing on boosting the immunity of those at quarantine centres by serving nutritious food to help them fight any infection with DCs of all the 24 districts monitoring the quarantine centres, an official statement said.

421,['24/05/2020'],"Chinese reaction may be a warning so that India sides with it on Covid, Taiwan, says ex-foreign secy Shyam Saran","What is the sudden provocation for the latest faceoff between India and China along the Line of Actual Control (LAC)? There have been two incidents – in Ladakh and in Sikkim.

PM Modi and Chinese President Xi Jinping had agreed to keep the LAC peaceful after Doklam . Do you think that the latest incidents have shown that Wuhan and Mahabalipuram summits were a failure?

Is India's infrastructure building a key provocation? How crucial is the road project that goes up to Daulat Beg Oldie (DBG)?

Since you had monitored the infrastructure development on the India-China border, how unbalanced is the development on the two sides?

Has the pace of infrastructure development increased in the last five to 10 years? What is your assessment?

Do you find a link between China's behaviour in India-China border and the South China Sea ? Does this aggressive behaviour show its weakness?

As a former ambassador to Nepal, how do you see it's role on Nepal's recent anti-India rhetoric and the publishing of maps making territorial claims. Do you see Beijing's active role in emboldening Nepal PM K P Sharma Oli's statements against India?

How do you see China's behaviour in the international fora, as it faces pressure to come clean on Covid-19? From its resistance to the probe into Covid-19’s origin to its muscle-flexing on Taiwan, what does it signal to the world?

Do you think Covid-19 has exposed President Xi's weakness? Can it become his Achilles Heel and could it become the “Chernobyl moment” for the Communist Party of China ? What's your view of the post-Covid world?

Former foreign secretary Shyam Saran was PM’s Special Envoy, and as National Security Advisory Board chairman carried out three extensive surveys to upgrade India’s border infrastructure. Now senior fellow at the Centre for Policy Research , Saran tells Himanshi Dhawan that China’s recent muscle-flexing is a bid to expand its territorial claims in the region, and a warning to avoid action against its economic interests.The incidents at Naku La on the Sikkim-Tibet border and the other on Pangong Lake in Ladakh are not unusual. They often erupt when patrols of the two sides encounter each other in zones where there is a difference in perception regarding the alignment of LAC. These usually get resolved in accordance with well laid down SOPs observed by both sides. The frequency of such incidents has been increasing because significant improvements in border infrastructure on both sides have enabled more regular patrolling of hitherto remote areas. The subsequent incident in the Galwan river area in Ladakh is more worrying because our forces have been active in this area, including in undertaking road building, without Chinese objection in the past. Reacting to such activity on our side of the LAC with a build-up of forces and, in effect, expanding its territorial claim, is escalatory behaviour. These actions may be in the nature of a warning to India not to join the US-led chorus of condemnation of China’s handling of the Covid-19 virus, refrain from supporting the restoration of observer status to Taiwan in WHO and avoid taking actions against Chinese economic interests such as the recent closing of the automatic route for Chinese investment in India.It would be premature to make such a judgment. The confidence building measures agreed upon between the two leaders at their summits are operational. Military personnel of the two sides have been holding flag meetings to prevent escalation. One hopes that this continues to be the case. While such incidents do take place from time to time, the India-China border has generally remained peaceful over the past several decades.China would prefer that the glaring asymmetry between the quality of infrastructure on the Indian and Chinese sides is not bridged by India since that reduces China’s dominance of the disputed border. While the asymmetry is still quite significant, India has been making steady improvements through road building in high altitude locations, setting up of new air bases such as at Nyoma in Ladakh and Tezpur in Assam. The quality of our high altitude posts has also been upgraded. The Demchok to DBG road is very important because it runs parallel to LAC and is linked, at various points, with the major supply bases further inland. We have also upgraded the various advance landing grounds along this stretch, including at DBG, Chushul, Fukche and Demchok. The Demchok-DBG road is mostly complete except for a segment which was originally planned over a perma-frost area but the alignment was later altered. It remains within our side of the LAC. It is construction along this new alignment which appears to have been challenged by the Chinese.As I have pointed out, there has been significant improvement in our border infrastructure over the past decade or so but the asymmetry with Chinese capabilities remains serious. For example, the Chinese post at Demchok is connected with a metal road to the Tibet-Xinjiang highway. It has 24X7 power supply, being connected to the power grid. There is an observation tower on the nearby Zorawar Hill that enables monitoring of any troop movement on our side. Our post at Demchok still depends upon diesel generators and a considerable part of supplies use helicopters or fixed-wing aircraft. From DBG when you fly in a helicopter to the Karakoram Pass the flight is monitored by an array of Chinese surveillance cameras placed on the hills on either side of the valley.Yes it has but there is still a long way to go. While we improve the infrastructure on our side, the Chinese are not sitting still. They continue to augment their capabilities.China has been adopting a more assertive posture in the Yellow Sea, the Taiwan Straits and the South China Sea at least since 2010. It has forcibly occupied a number of offshore islands claimed by other states such as Vietnam, Malaysia and Brunei. Its coast guard and naval vessels have been engaged in provocative manoeuvres and in effect, China now claims and seeks to dominate the whole of the South China Sea. So its behaviour on the India-China border appears to be part of this pattern.Nepal’s reaction to the construction of the Pithoragarh-Lipulekh Pass road is more related to internal political dynamics in Nepal in which China has played a role but there may not have been direct instigation by China. Prime Minister Oli was under threat because the Maoist leader Prachanda and Oli’s rival in the party, Madhav Nepal, had reportedly joined hands to unseat Oli. The Chinese ambassador to Nepal allegedly played a role in persuading the two leaders to refrain from destabilising the government. The Lipulekh controversy came in very handy for Oli to deflect attention from his own troubles by upping the ante on this longstanding issue and projecting himself as an ardent nationalist and patriot, defying India. He went overboard in using abusive and offensive language against India but may have calculated that China will provide a shield against any Indian retaliation. One is reminded of a similar situation in 1960 when the then King Mahendra inaugurated direct monarchical rule and an anti-Indian nationalist policy calculating that in view of the deteriorating relations between India and China, India would have limited room to oppose him. Even at that time Nepal did not challenge India’s sovereignty over Lipulekh and its own maps did not show this area as belonging to Nepal. This happened post-1990 when some Nepalese scholars began to reinterpret the Sugauli Treaty of 1816, which defined the India-Nepal border in the west as the Mahakali river, by tracing the river’s main channel to a more western tributary. If long established borders are sought to be challenged on the basis of some old documents or maps resurfacing, then where do we stop? Having said that, I believe the Indian Army chief ought to have refrained from commenting on a matter that is diplomatically sensitive. The Nepalese side had already reacted adversely to the publication of an Indian map in November last year reflecting the newly created Union Territories of Ladakh and Jammu and Kashmir which showed the Lipulekh Pass in India. This did not represent any departure from the alignment depicted in the past and yet the Nepalese side sought to depict this as cartographic aggression by India. Being aware of the sensitivities involved perhaps a high profile event for the inauguration of the new highway by the defence minister could have been avoided. While rejecting Nepal’s claim we should remain committed to resolving all outstanding issues through friendly negotiations. After all 98% of the border is already settled.In keeping with its expanding economic and military capabilities, second only to the US, China has been playing a more active and combative role on the international stage. It wishes to be acknowledged as the uncontested leader in Asia. Chinese thinking equates hierarchy with harmony. Peace can be maintained only if there is a clear hierarchy of states each knowing its place in the pecking order. China believes it’s natural place is at the top of this hierarchy which other states must be persuaded to acknowledge; if necessary, should be compelled to do so through coercive measures. A section of the Chinese leadership believes that the Covid-19 pandemic is a window of opportunity for China to expand its regional and global influence. Its economic recovery is earlier and faster than other major economies giving it a first-mover advantage. However, while China may be hegemonic in intent, it is still not so in capabilities so there may be a real risk of its over extending. The pushback against China that we have witnessed in the past few weeks including at the World Health Assembly is noteworthy.While in the initial phase of the Covid-19 crisis Xi Jinping’s leadership appeared to be shaky, he has regained his authority and standing. The drastic and apparently successful measures to overcome the coronavirus and the early signs of economic recovery have put him in a strong position. That confidence is reflected in the decision to convene the Chinese Peoples’ Political Consultative Conference and the National People’s Congress from May 21 onwards in the Chinese capital after a delay of only two months. Under the pretext of Covid-19 the two meetings could have been easily deferred if Xi felt he was under political threat. That he has gone ahead with the meetings reflects renewed confidence.The world is undergoing a wrenching transformation. We know that the post-pandemic world will be very different from what we have been familiar with but it is difficult to say where the chips will fall once the churning begins to ebb. On present indications, it appears that China may emerge from this as a more powerful country, at least in relative terms. We may see a loosely structured cluster of several regional powers and a more regionalised globalisation. Beyond that we will just have to keep our seatbelts fastened and wait to see where we land.",india,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-75926946,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-187742,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/chinese-reaction-may-be-a-warning-so-that-india-sides-with-it-on-covid-taiwan-says-ex-foreign-secy-shyam-saran/articleshow/75926909.cms
422,['24/05/2020'],"It’s different, but it’s definitely Eid","Ranchi: With the holy month of Ramzan nearing its end and mosques remaining closed for more than two months owing to the lockdown imposed to contain the spread of the novel coronavirus, Muslims across the city are prepared to celebrate Eid-ul-Fitr without large feasts, family gatherings and exchange of gifts.

The festival, marking the end of Ramzan, usually brings families and friends together, but this year community leaders and social outfits have asked people to stay at home and adhere to social distancing measures. Amid the pandemic, Eid celebrations are likely be a muted, but members of the Muslim community, particularly the youngsters, have reinvented the rituals and traditions of Ramzan in line with the call of the day.

Observing Ramzan largely from the confines to their homes, young Muslims used technology and the internet to come together with friends and family. From sharing the most delicious iftars and sehris through video conferences on Zoom and Google Meet to greeting the family during late night chats on WhatApp groups, young Muslims gave a digital touch to the holy month.

Anam Sanober, a resident of Karbala Chowk in the city, who has family members living in Bengaluru and Hazaribag, resurrected a group on social media to ensure they get the feel of togetherness. “Through the last four weeks, the family logged on to video chat apps every day during sehri. Some stayed up all night while the older members of the family woke up the lazy ones in time for the meal before sunrise. We may not be physically close, but I don’t remember the last time we connected as much during Ramzan,” said the 25-year-old, who quit her job as a primary school teacher days before the lockdown to pursue higher studies.

Left with nothing to do with the stay-at-home order in place, teenager Fahed Abdullah discovered that his “grungy” personality is merely a mask and he cannot without being connected to his friends and family. At 15, he was going through the same awkwardness that boys his age do.

“The lockdown made Ramzan a lot more relaxed than usual, giving me time and incentive to connect with relatives. I don’t have my own phone and my mother gets surprised whenever I ask her for hers to greet older members of my family. With schools closed and tuitions suspended, I spent Ramzan developing an interest in talking to others. I now realise that I actually enjoy these conversations,” said the Kairali School student, who is awaiting his matriculation results that have been delayed due to the lockdown.

For Saba Gulrez, a resident of Doranda, the lockdown was unexpected and, on March 26, Ramzan was a month away. Like many others she made herself believe that things would be alright in time for the holy month and Eid.

“I had no clue we would be locked in for this long and even a simple get-together with family and friends would become a challenge,” said Gulrez, who in her thirties runs a production house that specializes in making corporate promotional advertisements. “As the seriousness of the pandemic drove home, we started dedicating our Zakat to people who need it the most. Almost everyone I know are now using online donation platforms for Zakat. Every day I get dozens of such requests and appeals to help and we are trying to make a difference with whatever little we can do,” added the mother of two, who has been balancing work and family duties through the lockdown.

Now, when the entire community has come to terms with the outbreak and is prepared to celebrate Eid behind closed doors. Fahed, the introvert teenager, said: “I will schedule at least half a dozen group calls with friends and relatives and show them the delicacies on the dining table. I am also help at a local initiative that is serving water and food and I will continue to contribute my time volunteering.”

Gulrez said she will ensure that this Eid, which hopefully will never be celebrated under such circumstances ever again, will be remembered by her family. “For the first time in the 14-century history of Islam, our community members won’t meet and greet each other. I will share my moments of celebration with family and friends through video calls. For my boys, I’ll cook something from our list of family recipes and add a modern twist it so that they have something unique to remember this very different Eid,” she said.

VADODARA: If it wouldn’t have been for his benevolent Muslim neighbourhood, 19-year-old driver in Bodeli, Chirag Tadvi, would have faced starvation during the lockdown. But that’s not how the neighbours in Navinagri slums think — here brotherhood thrives above the material wants. And, it was in that community feeling that a kitchen fed 700-odd mouths daily, including 25-odd Hindus like Tadvi.

But the feeling’s mutual. As a gesture of solidarity and gratitude, Tadvi and his friends also decided to share something precious to their benefactors — the 27th day of Ramzan fast — on May 20, considered very auspicious.

“Usually, I observe fast every Saturday from a vow I took several years ago. But this time during Ramzan, we decided to observe fast on the 27th day to mark our gratitude for our neighbours who did not discriminate while feeding the needy during lockdown. We also prayed together to ward-off coronavirus,” said Tadvi.

Children as young as eight to 15 were also among the group to observe the fast.

Arvind Tadvi, a fruit vendor, said that he will remain eternally grateful to his neighbours for feeding them in the critical times. “We wanted to thank them by offering special prayers for them,” said Tadvi, whose 13-year-old daughter Esha and son Bhavesh (15) too joined him in observing a day’s fast along with others.

“Had they not started the community kitchen, my family would have starved as my work was completely shut due to lockdown,” said Shankar Tadvi, an auto-rickshaw driver, from the slums.

The fast observers continued their daily work without even drinking water, but by dusk they were exhausted. “By 4 pm I felt tired so I had to return home and take rest,” said Shankar. Another fast observer Dhaval Bariya too had to lie down for a couple of hours.

Initiated by Mushtaq Khatri, a farmer, and his friends, the community kitchen was an effort from their own pockets during the initial days. Only later, he got help from several people in Bodeli to keep the kitchen fires burning.

“We fed 700-odd people daily without any discrimination. A few traders and influential people also donated money which kept our kitchen running,” said Khatri, who would cook food and distribute in every household in the area with the help of volunteers.

Food for ‘sehri’, a ritual prior to the fast, and ‘iftaar’, a meal taken while breaking the fast were also made by Khatri and his family members. From ‘ras-puri’, fritters, samosas, khaman, fruits among other items, iftaar was always a good sumptuous spread.

426,['24/05/2020'],"In 18 C-zones, NMC using spl equipment","Nagpur: The Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) has started screening high-risk persons in containment zones by using equipment like pulse oximeters and infrared thermometer guns.

Municipal commissioner Tukaram Mundhe, chief medical officer, Dr Yogendra Savai, additional chief medical officer, Dr Praveen Gantawar, and his team have implemented the system in 18 containment zones.

The civic body has already quarantined and tested all family members and close contacts of all positive persons in containment zones. The NMC even conducted its mass quarantined model in few containment zones like Mominpura, Satranjipura, Parvati Nagar and Gaddigodam.

“NMC teams are doing door-to-door survey in containment zones. At times, teams do not get correct information or miss identifying doubtful cases. We have to ensure the safety of all high-risk patients. We have given 165 Pulse Oximeters and 50 infrared thermometer guns,” Dr Gantawar told TOI.

“Teams will check the oxygen saturation level and body temperature of high-risk persons and recommend quarantining accordingly. This will help in identifying positive patients and ensure treatment at the initial stage itself,” he added.

In high-risk population, the NMC is targeting patients of cancer, severe acute respiratory infection (SARI), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), those over 60 years and pregnant women.

The NMC has already started taking swab samples of pregnant women from containment zones. There will be special camps in Mominpura where eight pregnant women tested positive. There were similar camps in Satranjipura, Parvati Nagar and Pandhrabodi containment zones. Special camps have been planned in the remaining containment zones in the coming days.

The Mominpura containment zone in Central Nagpur was started on April 4. Positive persons are being reported on a daily basis. The number of cases from this locality, the city’s second hotspot, has risen to 220.

The Satranjipura containment zone in East Nagpur became operational on April 6. Nearly 121 cases were reported from this area which is the city’s first hotspot. No positive case has been reported from this locality since May 15.

Gaddigodam in West Nagpur has emerged as the third hotspot where 22 cases have been reported since May 18.

Although cases from the other containment zones are not reported on a daily basis, a few are under institutional quarantine.

The central government’s Rapid Response Team had credited the NMC’s innovative measures for fewer deaths and cases in the city. Some of the measures were the mass quarantine model, door-to-door survey of all houses, special camps for high-risk patients, tracing close contacts of positive persons, 14-day institutional quarantine for all suspected patients and spraying of disinfectants across the city.

Almost every section in these popular state board-affiliated schools is brimming with more than 50 students, where rising aspirations and zero or negligible fee has led to a spurt in admissions. Some of these schools are already operating in two shifts, which means there is no wriggle room left to implement Covid distancing guidelines The idea being floated by education officials, health professionals and activists focuses on having classes on alternate days after dividing each section in two batches. “That won’t work in our schools because it’s already operating at double the capacity. Even if we split, there will still be minimum 20-25 students left in each class which even may be higher than the intended figure,” said a principal. So far no official guidelines have come but schools know that implementation of Covid distancing is dependent completely on physical infrastructure and capacity.Another principal said, “A couple of such schools are already working in double shifts because they are unable to adjust all students in a single one. If such schools have to implement the Covid distancing guidelines then students will have to be called just one in four days.”Another principal said the English private-aided schools cannot reduce the number of admissions. “Every parent from poor and lower middle class background aspires for English medium education for their children. The private unaided schools are beyond their financial reach while civic schools are not English medium. In such schools, they pay negligible fee till primary section as it is not under aided category, after which education is free. Only two schools in Nagpur have aided primary section, so at others you have to pay some about,” said the principal.The principal further said,“We would love to stop admission after 30 students in each section, but there is tremendous pressure from education officials and politicians to ‘honour’ their recommendation letters. That’s how over the decades our class sizes have swelled up.”Now, all eyes are now on new standard operating procedures which the state education department is expected to officially announce next month.",nagpur,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-47529300,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-110164,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/almost-impossible-to-follow-covid-19-norms-say-schools/articleshow/75926933.cms
428,['24/05/2020'],"With curtains down since two mths, artistes struggling a lot","Nagpur: The lockdown has spared none. Artistes and backstage workers are sitting idle since two months as cultural programmes, plays and concerts have come to a standstill, resulting in lack of livelihood or income. Recently, some artistes were provided with essentials by members of the Antarman Kala Academy, the Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) and a few from the fraternity, but many are yet to get help in desperate times like these.

A team of seven, led by Kunal Gadekar, president of Antarman Kala Academy and a theatre artiste himself, joined hands to help struggling artistes by providing flour, rice, lentils, sugar, tea, masala packets, biscuits, oil, salt and masks. “These artistes and workers deserve equal attention like the others. They have families to feed. The field of art and theatre is their only source of income. We helped them with our personal contributions,” said Gadekar.

Team member Indrayani Babhule shared some insights. “We all pitched in money. We also received support from many citizens. We have helped over 50 artistes and intend to help more. We prepared a list of essentials and then made kits for distribution. Most of the artistes are daily wagers. They were happy to get help. We could see the smile of relief on their faces,” she said.

Make-up artist Nakul Shrivas is in the business for over 15 years. He went to Uttarakhand to work for a Tamil film. The shooting was called off because of the lockdown and he was left him with no work. “I had to manage all my expenses in Uttarkhand on my own. It cost me a lot. After returning, I was helped by Gadekar and his team and a few other artistes from the city. I’m grateful to them. Artistes are struggling even to buy basic daily need items,” he said.

Another make-up artiste, Asha Tarekar, faced a tough time to stock up her pantry, medicine and other needs. “We are happy for being acknowledged. Our income depends upon the number of events and shows we do. Because of lockdown, we earned no money,” she said.

Limca Book of Records holder, singer Sunil Waghmare, discussed the sad situation of the city-based artistes and singers with Hemant Gadkari, state general secretary of MNS. In no time, Gadkari swung into action along with party colleague Dinesh Ilme and provided a fair amount of essentials, including groceries and bakery products to many artistes. “I have a lot of love and respect for singers and artistes. We had to help them after getting to know about their situation. We did our bit to ease their pain,” he said.

There are a few who have dedicated their lives for their profession. “I am working in the city since 30 years. My passion and profession is acting in plays and dramas. It’s my only source of income. Nobody thought about us. We are not even in limelight. There are many who have not received any help,” said Milind Ramteke.

At plays, Prakash Mule is a regular fixture in the lighting department. “We have received no help. Lightning and technical work is the essence of any play. I also have a team of workers who have families that are dependent on them. My business in shut and the situation is sad,” he said.

Set designer Swapnil Bohate couldn’t agree any better. “The lockdown has taught us a lot of things and has shown us a very ugly side. My business in dependent on set designing. I took a loan to start the business. We need help from the government for the artistes, singers and performers. We need a funding scheme so that we can buy essentials according to our needs,” he said.

If generous donors wish to help struggling artistes in any way then they can get in touch with Kunal Gadekar of Antarman Kala Academy (7709065653).

430,['24/05/2020'],"Eid and Ramzan during lockdown a memorable experience, say rozdaars","Nagpur: This Eid is different and unique in its own way. Right from dressing up at home, greeting friends and relatives on video calls, offering prayers online with family and children keeping roza for the first time, it has been an amazing experience for the Muslim community.

Dawoodi Bohras follow Misri calendar while rest of the Muslims follow lunar calendar. Bohras celebrated Eid-ul-Fitr on Saturday though the moon was not sighted. Rest of the Muslim community will celebrate the festival either on Sunday or Monday.

According to rozdaars, this Ramzan taught them many new things. Professor Mohammed Ayub Khan believes that Ramzan in lockdown was a blessing in disguise as it gave them an opportunity to help the mankind. “We spent our month by helping the needy and poor. How often do we get to do that? We donated essential commodity kits, food and much more. This Ramzan all Muslims performed their best deeds,” he said.

“Lockdown Ramzan and Eid was a very different experience. We were more relaxed as there was not much work to do. We did family gatherings and exchanged wishes on a digital platform,” said Shehr Merchant, an architect. Her mother Nilofer Kamal did miss the prayers offered in masjid during the holy month but felt it was a beautiful Ramzan experience.

“This Ramzan will be a memorable one. It has taught the true meaning of love and patience. We prayed from our hearts for an end to the virus spread. We will be preparing all sorts of delicacies at home with my children so we can have or little family Eid celebration,” said Sumera Siddique.

This Ramzan amid lockdown, Saleha Siddique said, has taught her about adjustments and valuing whatever she has. “Every Eid we would go out and greet our relatives by hugging and bonding with them. All my friends and cousins would come to our house and we would have feast together. This time I will dress up at home and help my mother in the kitchen,” she said.

Hasan Zakir, businessmen who celebrated Eid on Saturday, said, “We had a good celebration at home. We couldn’t go out and meet our loved ones or offer namaz at masjid, but following rules was more important” he said.

Kausar Ali Khumusi, head of Nagpur Jamaat that celebrated Eid on Saturday, believes that this was the most beautiful Eid celebration as it has taught many life lessons to all. “The essence of Ramzan and Eid is to understand the value of humanity and life. Today many are struggling to go home, hence this holy month taught us to value our resources,” he said.

Being at home gave many children opportunity to keep roza for the first time. “My children were so excited to keep roza and each day they would help their mother in preparing the feast. This Ramzan will be remembered for years to come,” said Ejaz Ahmed, a lawyer.

The Congress said that the government is doing little to rein in private hospitals. The Congress said that as compared to neighbouring Maharashtra, the cost of Covid-19 treatment in private hospitals was more than double in Gujarat.

The BJP shot back, saying that when the state is battling the pandemic, the Congress was seeking political mileage.

GPCC general secretary Nishit Vyas said that patients are being forced to pay Rs 10,000 for admission to normal wards in Gujarat, while the rate in Maharashtra has been fixed at Rs 4,000. He said charges for ventilators and ICU in Gujarat are Rs 19,000 per day while in Maharashtra it was only Rs 7,500. “Although there are more Covid-19 patients in Maharashtra, the rate of treatment at private hospitals is less than half of that here,” Vyas said.

For the second consecutive day, the Congress raised the issue of pricing of N95 masks sold at Amul outlets. BJP spokesperson Bharat Pandya, while refuting the allegations, said the Congress is making an issue out of a non-issue.

Senior officials from government medical college and hospitals (GMCHs) at all the three districts blamed it on the government for diverting machinery and technicians required for its installation to Jalgaon, where number of cases has spiralled since last few says.

The respective deans told TOI that their infrastructure is ready but they are yet to receive other crucial equipment and machinery to start the Covid-19 testing.

At Chandrapur, the GMCH is yet to receive RT-PCR machine, which is most crucial for conducting these specialized tests. “The government has diverted our machine to Jalgaon by issuing a circular. Otherwise, we are fully ready to start VRDL operations. We are expecting the RT-PCR machine in a couple of days,” dean SS More told TOI.

In Gondia, though the RT-PCR machine was delivered, the technicians supposed to install it were taken to Jalgaon citing emergency. “We were told that the technicians will first install RT-PCR at Jalgaon and then visit Gondia. Except cold centrifuge machine and some other minor equipment, we are fully ready. We expect to start the trials by May 26-27,” dean VP Rukhmode told TOI.

In Yavatmal too, cold centrifuge machine is yet to be delivered, which is crucial for conducting the Covid-19 tests. “We have already installed RT-PCR machine, but until cold centrifuge machine arrives, we can’t go ahead. It’s expected to be delivered within a couple of days after which we can start trials. Our doctors and technicians have already completed training to operate the machines,” professor Dr Kamble told TOI.

After HC’s censuring, the government on April 23 had informed that it would take at least three to four weeks for making Covid-19 labs operational at GMCHs of all three districts, as purchased orders were placed through Haffkine’s Institute. Till date, none of centres have full set of machinery.

On March 23, the HC had first directed the government to open VRDL centres at Chandrapur, Yavatmal and Gondia, along with Gadchiroli within two weeks.

They were designated for Covid-19 recently and, on Saturday, Cygnus hospital witnessed a fire incident after which many some of the Covid-19 patients had to be shifted.Delhi has a total of 14 hospitals that have been designated for Covid-19. Of this, two are state-run, four are centre-run and eight are private hospitals. These hospitals have enough beds available. For example, Lok Nayak hospital, which is run by Delhi government, has close to 2,000 beds, of which about 27% are occupied at present by Covid-19 positive cases. Some other beds at the hospitals have suspected cases.

440,['24/05/2020'],"Punjab MSMEs incurred loss of over Rs 4,169 crore","Punjab lists steps Centre’s stimulus package missed

CHANDIGARH: Hit hard by disruption of activities caused by restrictions imposed to curb the spread of novel coronavirus , the micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) in Punjab have suffered an estimated loss of Rs 4,169 crore since middle of March.Punjab’s department of industries and commerce assessed the loss caused by the novel coronavirus pandemic by taking feedback from the industry. The 2.8 lakh MSME units in the state faced heavy loss on account of wages, interest burden on capital, advance to labour and personal income loss to the owners. The average loss per unit in Ludhiana, the industrial hub of Punjab, has been pegged at Rs 1.9 lakh.Of the 2.8 lakh MSMEs in the state, only about 1.47 lakh have been able to commence their operations, that too, at low capacity utilisation of up to 40% due to disruption in the labour supply, unavailability of raw material.Based on the feedback of the industry, the department of industries and commerce has compiled a list of measures which have not been included in the stimulus package announced by the central government and are required for injecting new lease of life to industry in Punjab.As the industrial units are not in position to repay existing loans due to financial crunch, Punjab has suggested to the central government that bank interest on the existing loans may be waived for a minimum of six months. The state warned that if relief is not provided to the industrial units, they will have to borrow more money to repay the existing loans, which will result in many non-performing assets (NPAs) in the future.The Union government had announced making contribution towards ESI and EPF for industrial units with less than 100 workers wherein 90% workers are up to the wage level of Rs 14,999. The state has suggested to give relief to the whole industrial sector by doing away with both the clauses. Punjab contended that by putting the cap, central government was discouraging employment of more people.The state also proposed to the Centre that employees insured under ESI should be treated as sick and the epidemic period be treated as sickness period and ESI should pay salaries during this period.Other suggestions include option to defer tax payments by six months and also permission for delayed Good and Services Tax (GST) payments, without levy of interest, or late fees or penalties; additional benefits over for export oriented unit; and interest subvention for agriculture and food processing industry on their working capital requirement of at least 3%, for a period of 24 months.Sibin C, director, industries and commerce, Punjab, said based on the feedback received from the industry, the department compiled a list of measures which need to be taken for revival of industry in Punjab. “These suggestions will be sent to the Government of India through CM Amaninder Singh,” said Sibin C.",chandigarh,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-75931368,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-173061,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/punjab-msmes-incurred-loss-of-over-rs-4169-crore/articleshow/75931357.cms
441,['24/05/2020'],Afghan Taliban announce three-day Eid ceasefire,"<p>In this photo taken on April 25, 2020, young boys distribute foods as others wait to break their fast durin... Read More

KABUL: The Taliban announced a three-day ceasefire during the Eid al-Fitr holiday starting Sunday in a surprise move following months of bloody fighting with Afghan forces after the group signed a landmark agreement with the United States.

President Ashraf Ghani swiftly welcomed the insurgents' offer and ordered his forces to also comply, while the US envoy to Afghanistan hailed the deal as a ""momentous opportunity.""

Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid said in a statement posted on social media that the group's ""leadership instructs all the mujahideen of the Islamic Emirate to take special measures for security of the countrymen, and conduct no offensive operation against the enemy anywhere.""

The statement, which announced a halt to hostilities ""during the three days of Eid,"" instructed Taliban fighters to refrain from entering government areas and also said that Kabul forces were not allowed to enter territories under their control.

Since the US invasion in 2001 there has only been one other pause in the fighting - a surprise three-day ceasefire between the Taliban and Kabul marking the religious festival of Eid in 2018.

That ceasefire call was given by Ghani, which the insurgents had accepted.

During the brief lull in fighting at that time, Afghans responded joyfully, with Taliban fighters, security forces and civilians hugging, sharing ice creams and posing for selfies in previously unimaginable scenes.

Ghani was quick to accept the Taliban ceasefire offer Saturday.

""I welcome the ceasefire announcement by the Taliban,"" he said on Twitter.

""As commander-in-chief I have instructed ANDSF (Afghan National Defence Security Force) to comply with the three-day truce and to defend only if attacked.""

The announcement comes just days after the Taliban's leader Haibatullah Akhundzada urged Washington ""not to waste"" the opportunity offered by the deal the militants signed with the United States in February that set the stage for the withdrawal of foreign troops from the country.

""The Islamic Emirate is committed to the agreement... and urges the other side to honour its own commitments and not allow this critical opportunity to go to waste,"" Akhundzada said in a statement, using the Taliban's name for Afghanistan.

The signing of the deal between the United States and Taliban was preceded by a so-called ""reduction in violence"" but not an official ceasefire.

US Special Representative to Afghanistan Zalmay Khalilzad, who brokered the deal, said on Twitter Saturday that the United States welcomed ""the Taliban's decision to observe a ceasefire during Eid, as well as the Afghan government announcement reciprocating and announcing its own ceasefire.""

He urged the Taliban to continue to abide by the agreement, calling the halt in violence ""a momentous opportunity that should not be missed"" while pledging that the United States would ""do its part to help.""

NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg also welcomed the ceasefire, urging all parties to ""seize this opportunity for peace, for the benefit of all Afghans.""

The US-Taliban deal is aimed at paving the way for the insurgents to hold direct peace talks with Kabul.

US President Donald Trump's administration has made it a priority to end the war in Afghanistan, and in a bid to pull out foreign forces US officials have been pushing the Taliban and government leaders to hold peace talks.

Analysts however say the Taliban have been emboldened by the deal with the US, and Afghan government officials have reported more than 3,800 attacks since it was signed, killing 420 civilians and wounding 906.

But Khalilzad has maintained that the insurgents have kept up their end of the bargain -- even if recent violence violated the spirit of the accord.

""The Taliban have implemented their agreement not to attack the coalition forces,"" he said earlier this month.

The remarks come after a horrific attack against a maternity hospital in Kabul that killed dozens -- including mothers and infants -- and a suicide bombing at a funeral.

The Taliban denied involvement in the attacks, but President Ghani blamed them and the Islamic State (IS) group for the bloodshed.

Following that attack and another suicide bombing in the country's east the government ordered security forces to switch to an ""offensive"" posture against the Taliban.

The Taliban responded by vowing to increase attacks against government forces.

The group has carried out regular attacks against Afghan forces in recent days, and earlier this week even tried to enter the northern city of Kunduz.

Afghan forces, however, managed to repel the Taliban attack on Kunduz, a city which had fallen to the insurgents twice before.

They cannot ban the entry of service providers but only act as facilitators of service.“I want to reiterate — the district administration had not issued any order on the entry of domestic staff, drivers, plumbers and electricians earlier as it had left it to the RWAs. But for the sake of clarity, we issued a specific order on Saturday ... RWAs will act as advisors whose job is limited to ensuring residents can access services and facilities with safety norms in place,” district magistrate Ajay Shankar Pandey said.The order stated that the entry and engagement of domestic staff, plumbers, electricians, newspaper delivery personnel and daily service staff is up to residents. It is “between service providers and those seeking the services”. RWAs can act as overseeing bodies or take on an advisory role to ensure that social distancing and hygiene norms are followed.For residents, it’s a welcome relief. Ashwani Kumar, a resident of Vartalok Apartment in Vasundhara, said his mother is 70 years old and has special medical needs. “She is dependent on caregiving staff, who had been denied entry. It had been very difficult.”RWAs said they appreciate the “clarity”. Vinay Mittal, president of Kaushambi area RWA , said, “The district administration has in hindsight come up with clear guidelines.

443,['24/05/2020'],Coronavirus makes even young draw up their wills,"More assets leading youngsters to make wills, say lawyers

More on Covid-19

NEW DELHI: The inevitability of death, security of one's family or an anticipated wrangling over inheritance has never got an average Indian worried enough to start thinking about writing a will till one is in the late 50s. Covid-19 has changed that.A 29-year-old interior designer, a 32-year-old corporate executive and a restaurant owner in his early 40s are among people who are rushing to their lawyers to draft a will. The steadily mounting cases and uncertainty over treatment and development of a vaccine for coronavirus has led to an increase in anxiety. The prolonged lockdown has provided a fertile ground for worries to grow.Lawyers are reporting a sudden surge in the demand for drawing up a will. Young professionals, entrepreneurs and even those in family businesses are leaving nothing to chance, painfully aware about the randomness in the way corona targets an individual and their vulnerability in the absence of a vaccine.The pandemic has not only stopped the country in its tracks but also shattered the confidence of people, says advocate Neoma Vasdev.She says she was taken aback when many people in the 30-45 age-group approached her for a will. “We are witnessing a rush for drafting wills, triggered by a growing awareness among people that lockdown or no lockdown, one has to be prepared for the inevitable perils of this disease. Undoubtedly, this is very unnatural because with medical advancement, one does not anticipate people below 55 to come for a will,” she observes. “Almost all my clients are going for mutual wills where one spouse is protected by the other by willing them everything after which it goes to the next generation.”With disposable incomes having gone up in the past decade when both spouses work, young professionals amass considerable assets in property and shares by the time they reach the 40s. It is the need to secure these assets that appears to have spurred people to get their wills made.Advocate Virender Goswami agrees. “ We usually receive queries on estate management and preparing of wills from senior people, if they are suffering from some ailment or are about to undergo some difficult medical procedure. But during the current lockdown, we have got more such requests from otherwise healthy, young persons, perhaps jittery over the uncertainty of the present times,” he adds.Advocate Gaurang Kanth says one reason this trend has caught on is because getting a will made is not a long-drawn legal process. “It is a good idea to register a will but that isn’t mandatory, making it a less complicated exercise. The document can be made by anyone with two witnesses, who may be family members but are not beneficiaries of the will. They need to be present at the time of signing of the will by its maker though they need not be aware of its contents,” Kanth explained.",delhi,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-75936277,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-465440,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/ready-willing-corona-makes-even-young-draw-up-their-wills/articleshow/75931375.cms

NEW DELHI: You can still window-shop, but the days of trying without buying are over. Whether it’s shoes or textiles, you are not welcome to get tactile. As the city’s markets stagger to their feet after the long lockdown, early shoppers are returning underwhelmed. When Kriti Gupta (name changed) went to Connaught Place on Saturday to buy formals, the salesman told her she would need to pay the price of the dress before trying it on. To prevent contamination of goods, they weren’t letting shoppers touch dress material, shoes and even bags, she said.As stores try to keep both shoppers and staff safe from the coronavirus, finding the right colour, cut, size and fit has become a test of your judgment and imagination.If shopping is your idea of post-lockdown therapy, it might leave you cold. Cautionary signs are everywhere. You need to await your turn if five shoppers are inside a store. At the door, greeters ask you to wear a mask, and at some places they press disposable gloves into your hands. Whether it’s South Extension or Connaught Place, Kamla Nagar or Preet Vihar, the leisurely, air-conditioned shopping experience is history, TOI found.A Preet Vihar store for clothes and accessories was letting customers in only after thermal scanning. They had to sanitise their hands and wear plastic gloves. “I came here because I desperately need summer clothes for my daughter,” said Shalini Jain, who lives nearby. “But with the air conditioner turned down, the store was so humid that choosing clothes was no pleasure. Since only a few trial rooms were open, we decided to take them anyway.”Another shop for women’s clothing and shoes nearby was following the same rules. The lift and escalators were not working and customers had to await their turn in a covered parking area. They gave tokens at the entrance and also took down personal details of the shoppers after sanitising their hands. But inside, the atmosphere was drab. New arrivals weren’t showcased. Shopping felt like a chore.There was more freedom at a foreign brand’s store in South Extension. You could feel the clothes, the aircon was working, the new stuff was on display, and cash wasn’t a no-no.“But what about social distancing?” said a worried shopper, “they are not regulating the number of people allowed inside at a time.” However, Vijay Kumar, a South Extension trader, said their showrooms cover 2,500-8,000 sqft, so allowing only 5-6 customers at a time would be impractical.“We take all precautions. Even disposable masks are provided to people for safety, because we don't want our shops to close again. Also, I think, customers are more than alert now,” Kumar said.At a men’s store in Kamla Nagar, the restrooms and trial rooms were closed. They were giving customers a 30-day exchange window instead. There were no water bottles for customers at the counter, and digital payments were preferred. “Trial rooms are closed for the safety of customers,” said a salesman. “If everyone starts trying on clothes, not only the trial rooms but also the apparel would need to be sanitised again, which is impractical.”“We don’t want to dissuade customers, but they should get used to shopping like this because this crisis is not going to get over soon,” he added.",delhi,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-75931457,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-383364,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/first-buy-then-try-covid-concern-takes-all-the-fun-out-of-shopping-in-delhi/articleshow/75931374.cms

MUMBAI: A 13-year-old girl from Mahim has been relegated to the care of her domestic help since the lockdown. The schoolgirl's mother, who had left on a four-day business trip to Dubai , has been caught up there for nearly 70 days now after the lockdown was imposed.

Desperate to get back home to her child, the mother, Ruchira Varma, a single parent, has been pulling out all stops to return, but nothing has helped so far. ""The day I was supposed to fly out of Dubai, the lockdown started,"" Varma told TOI on phone. With no family or close friends there, she has been putting up at a hotel for more than two months ""The only hotel open here is The Taj. I ran out of money and have had to borrow,"" said Varma. ""I just want to get back home to my daughter.""

She said that Nationalist Congress Party leader Supriya Sule did reach out to her on Twitter to offer help. ""But no international flights are touching down in Mumbai currently. Even when they resume, preference will be given to the elderly, the ailing... So, this means my kid will continue to be home alone, unless I am given some preference.""

Back home, her daughter Shyla, a class 9 student of Poddar School, Santacruz, said she hopes the wait ends has started her online classes and is also attending tuitions online. Ruchira said she had left a smartphone for her daughter and this has now come handy for her.

The girl said she is learning to manage. ""But I'm just waiting for mom to return. Can't wait to hug her.""

HYDERABAD: A TikTok video has reunited a 60-year-old hearing and speech impaired man , who had gone missing two years ago, with his family in Bhadradri Kothagudem district . Roddam Venkateshwarlu was noticed in a video where he was being given food during the Covid-19 lockdown in Punjab.

""We do not know how he went there, but we are glad we found him,"" Venkateshwarlu's daughter Kanakadurga said.

Venkateshwarlu was born with the two handicaps and was a daily-wage earner. On April 27, 2018, he went to work as usual, came home for lunch and left again. But he never returned that day. ""We searched for him everywhere we could,"" Kanakadurga recalled, saying they had also made a complaint with the Burgampahad police.

Now, two years later on May 21, the family had a pleasant surprise. Kanakadurga was shown the video by some villagers while her brother Peddiraju, who works in Hyderabad, also got the video. They recognised their father, who had literally turned a beggar. He was wearing old clothes, was unkempt, using a walker to balance himself.

Burgampahad sub-inspector (SI) Balakrishna then worked on locating the person who had posted the video on TikTok.

Bhadradri Kothagudem SP Sunil Dutt told TOI that it was a head constable in Ludhiana who had made a video of the social service he was doing and shared it on social media. The video was put up on his handle 'goldypp99' and had 1.8 million views.

Video call done for verification

The Burgumpahad SI contacted the head constable of Punjab police. After confirmation, a video call was made to verify it was Venkateshwarlu in the video,” the SP said.

Peddiraju is now on his way to Ludhiana to meet his father. “It is a great feeling to find him when we practically gave up our hopes,” he said.

Peddiraju was provided a pass by the district police and they hired a car to travel to Punjab. He began his journey on May 22. “We want to thank all who helped my father and bring him back,” said Peddiraju, who is likely to start the journey back to Telangana on Sunday.

Later, on the basis of test results, those found negative will be relieved.Further, the state government has also decided to fill all vacant posts in the health department, especially in the Covid-19 dedicated hospitals in districts. In the first phase, the government has decided to fill vacancies for doctors and nursing staff at hospitals in East and West Godavari districts, Visakhapatnam and Chittoor.This would then be extended to Krishna, Guntur , Prakasam, Nellore and Ananthapur districts. Beds, ventilators and other infrastructure in hospitals will also be enhanced.During the meeting, the chief minister reiterated his decision to launch an extensive campaign against Covid-19 and create awareness about the disease among people. He emphasised upon the need to dispel the stigma surrounding the virus.A campaign titled ‘Hate the virus not the patient’ is likely to be launched by the state government once the lockdown is lifted. ‘Virus attack is not a crime’ is likely to be the slogan of said campaign.Chief minister Jaganmohan Reddy asked officials to allot toll-free numbers 104, 14410 and 1902 for people to contact their nearest hospitals. The chief minister directed officials to accept Covid-related complaints on 104 (ambulance), 14410 (tele-medicine) and 1902 (feedback) toll-free numbers.The CM further asked officials to upgrade the primary health centres (PHCs) across the state so that preliminary Covid-19 tests can be conducted in them.

The detailed order was uploaded Saturday.Air India pilot Deven Kanani had petitioned the HC for enforcement of the circular by AI on its flights including the Vande Bharat mission flights and his lawyer Abhilash Panickar argued it was a public health and safety requirement during the covid-19 pandemic contending that it was not complied with when returning with Indians stranded abroad.The HC bench via a video-conference hearing on Friday heard the matter twice.After the first hearing only on the March 23 circular the HC said the ""measures of social distancing'' in the circular intended ""reasonable caution'' for ""safe and healthy travel...without any differentiation of category of passengers'' and involved right to life guaranteed for citizens undertaking the travel.It also observed, that the March circular ""cannot be interpreted to apply differently to the passengers who are travelling from abroad and the domestic passengers.''It initially directed that the middle-seat vacant be enforced ""while lifting Indians from abroad and for non-scheduled commercial flights"".It also agreeing with Panickar's submission that stranded Indians lifted from US and UK may be covid-19 positive slammed AI and said, “In our prima facie view, Air India has violated Circular dated 23rd March, 2020 by not keeping one seat between two seats empty while allocation of the seat at the time of check-in.’’The bench directed AI and AI express to file detailed affidavit as to whether the circular was complied with and to state “number of seats occupied by passengers in each of the non-scheduled flights’’ during the repatriation flights since March 23 and the seating capacity of the air craft.Two hours later, the AI lawyer Abhinav Chandrachud pointed out that DGCA had on friday itself while announcing recommencement of domestic operations from May 25, issued the fresh circular with new comprehensive guidelines that no longer required a seat-vacant between passengers. The May 22 circular superceding the earlier one.But the HC observed,“it is not the case of AI and Air India Express that the May 22 circular applies to International operations or to non-scheduled flights’’The HC, modifying the order, said its earlier direction would remain but with a “rider that Circular dated 23.3.2020, shall be read with Circular dated 22.5.2020 to the extent that the Circular dated 23.3.2020 stands superceded in so far as domestic flights are concerned.’’In the first hearing,Chandrachud had submitted that even if one seat is kept vacant between twoseats, even then criteria of social distancing prescribed by the Government ofIndia would not be satisfied.To his other argument,the HC observed, “prima facie, we are unable to accept the submission’’ of theAI counsel “that social distancing measures …would apply only to scheduled and not to non-scheduled commercial flights or only to domestic operation and notto International. If these arguments are accepted, the whole purpose ofpreventing spread of Covid-19 by prescribed measures would be defeated.’’The HC will hear the matter next on June 2.

VISAKHAPATNAM: Migrant labourers put up at a quarantine centre at AP Residential School in Gummakota alleged on Saturday that the administration is not providing them adequate food and that the menu issued by the government is not being followed here. Around 252 people, including six pregnant women and 22 children have been housed at this quarantine centre since May 13.

The people at the quarantine centre, who have threatened to stage a protest, said that till date they haven’t been provided soap, sufficient rice or dal. These workers are tribals from interior villages in Ananthagiri mandal, near Araku, who had gone to Kolluru in Guntur district to work in brick kilns.

The lockdown put them in trouble as the brick kiln supervisors refused to make payments and they faced a lot of trouble attempting to make their way home. The workers in quarantine at the Gummakota quarantine centre are still 22kms away from their home mandal.

Jammi Polayya, one of the people putting up at the quarantine centre said, “The authorities are providing only 2kg dal and 500 grams of tamarind for 252 people. Is this sufficient? No officer has taken care of us.” He further alleged that while authorities are supposed to provide cooked food at quarantine centres, here the people have to cook their own food with scarce supplies.

“We have 22 children at the centre aged between two years to five years. How do we take care of them? We don’t even have buckets or mugs to take a bath with. After one week, the gas got over and we had to bring firewood from Kondapalli area ourselves to cook,” said Kiran, another worker staying at the centre.

Former MPTC of Ananthagiri mandal, D Ganga Raju has requested the tehsildar to provide food and other necessary facilities to workers put up at Gummakota, Piramid Dyana Kendra and Chilakalagedda Sivalingapuram.

Joint collector, M Venugopal Reddy, upon being contacted, said that he has given instructions to all tehsildars to provide cooked food. “I will verify this with the sub-collector of Paderu and arrange facilities. We will definitely take up the issue and resolve it by Sunday afternoon.”

MUMBAI: Love can bloom anywhere, anytime, despite all odds. Police constable Prasad Ware and his wife Varsha celebrated their third wedding anniversary in their twin room at a hospital in Bandra (east) on Saturday. Prasad and Varsha, Saki Naka residents, have recently tested positive for Covid-19.

The couple was in high spirits despite the gloom one generally associates with hospitals and illness. For the past two weeks, Varsha had been scouting for the ""perfect cake recipe"" for the D-day, and Prasad was scheduled to have Saturday off. ""With cake shops shut due to the lockdown, I thought I would bake one at home,"" Varsha told TOI on phone from her hospital room.

Far from what they had imagined, their wedding anniversary ended up taking place in a hospital, after they tested positive on May 21. They were then moved to a hospital in Bandra (E).

So there was no cake or the usual merriment they would have had. ""We cut fruits instead of cake, and fed one another,"" a gushing Prasad told TOI. The last two anniversaries were celebrated with their families, he said. ""This anniversary will be memorable. It may not have turned out the way we imagined it, but you know, we are together and have all the time in the world for each other,"" the constable said.

On Saturday evening, the two got ready and chatted with their family members, who wished them through video calls. The only one they missed terribly is their two-year-old son, who has been entrusted to the care of his ailing grandmother.

Prasad, who was involved in the investigation of a heist, had been staying at a hotel for the last few weeks. Two people arrested in the case tested positive. ""I kept away from home to avoid the risk of infecting my family, but my wife fell sick a few days ago,"" said Prasad. He has been exercising regularly, as he is preparing to give the police sub inspector exams.

The Ware couple are optimistic about beating the virus. ""We are in this together,"" said Varsha, adding, ""We will surely beat it together."" The only worry on their mind is for their son and Prasad's mother, who were both tested as well. Their reports are expected on Sunday. ""Once their reports are negative, we will be stress-free and recover faster,"" said Varsha.

Only 18-20 students would be seated in each classroom for the SSLC examination next month , primary and secondary education minister S Suresh Kumar said on Saturday.

""If any student is found suffering from cold or cough, he or she will be made to sit in a separate designated classroom,"" he said. ""Health officials will be deployed at exam centres to check every child and all classrooms will be sanitised before each exam.""

On SSLC students residing in containment zones, the minister said there would be no exam centres in such zones.

Warning over admissions

Minister for primary and secondary education S Suresh Kumar said: “If any region is declared a containment zone later, exams will be cancelled in such areas.” He cautioned private schools against starting admissions before the government issues an order on reopening of schools. “It’s shocking that some schools are preparing to conduct online classes even for kindergarten. No institution should start admissions until the state government’s official notification,” he said.

453,['24/05/2020'],6 Delhi returnees now working as cooks in Koderma isolation centre,"Ranchi: Thirty-five-year-old Pintu Pandey of Satgawan block in Koderma district was struggling to make ends meet after a prominent eatery in New Delhi, where he worked as a cook , shut down in March because of the lockdown. Pandey has now come back to his native place in March end and completed 14 days in institutional quarantine along with his five colleagues.

Fortunately for Pandey and his co-workers, they are now making decent money by cooking for the inmates at the quarantine centre. Of the six, two are employed as cooks while the rest are working as their helpers. All thanks to the district administration’s unique move to utilise their skills.

Koderma DC Gholap said the administration is paying Rs 800 each per day to the cooks and Rs 500 daily to the helpers. “We have named the kitchen as ‘Shramik Samman Kitchen’ where these migrants are catering to the inmates of the quarantine centre in the district.”

Talking to TOI, Pandey said he and his friends are earning almost the same as they were when they worked in Delhi before the lockdown came into force. He said, “On an average, we are cooking lunch and dinner for about 400 inmates daily. For lunch, we cook rice, sabji and a curry and for dinner, it is puri or chapattis and a curry. We now don’t want to go back to Delhi or any other place to earn a living. We want to settle here and live with our families.”

When asked how they bagged the job, Pandey said, “Once our quarantine period got over, we were in a fix regarding our next move. We then approached the driver of the local block development officer (BDO) with an offer to cook food for the inmates at the quarantine centre. He got us in touch with the BDO, who later spoke to the deputy commissioner.”

His friend Subodh Pandey, who is also a cook, said they don’t intend to go back to Delhi or other places once the lockdown is over. He added, “We don’t want to go back for work. We are planning to work here as long as the administration runs the quarantine centre. We will request the district administration to absorb us in some government-run kitchens or may set up our own small eatery here.”

Five columns of the Kumaon Regiment were deployed with road-clearing equipment like payloaders and bulldozers on Southern Avenue and in Tollygunge, Ballygunge, Rajarhat, New Town and Behala, all places where Amphan’s lashing uprooted thousands of huge trees and blocked entire roads.“Army support has been called for; NDRF and State Disaster Response Force teams deployed; Rly, Port & private sector, too, requested to supply teams and equipment,” the state home department tweeted on Saturday after saying it was “mobilising maximum strength in unified command mode on 24×7 basis for immediate restoration of essential infrastructure and services ASAP”.The appeal and the quickened response followed protests in several city pockets over Friday and Saturday against the continuing power blackout, which also resulted in dry taps, especially in south Kolkata and the city’s northern and southern fringes. Utilities have repeatedly stressed the need to first get the felled trees out of the way for restoration of power and other communication channels.CM Mamata Banerjee, sensing the mood in the city, stepped in to soothe frayed tempers and appealed to people to bear with state agencies for a few days. “Behead me if you want. But try to appreciate the difficulties. We are not sitting idle. A total of 225 teams are working in Kolkata. I understand your problem. I have spoken to CESC’s Sanjiv Goenka.

On Saturday, Ranchi DC Rai Mahimapat Ray said, “As we have fulfilled all parameters set by the Union ministry of health and family welfare for orange zone, Ranchi is longer in the red zone.” He added, “We are conducting a health survey in various parts of Hindpiri to check prevalence of the viral infection, following which the administration will take a call on reducing the radius of the containment area in Hindpiri locality.”

Hindpiri had been sealed off completely since April 11 soon after locking it down partially when the state’s first Covid-19 patient was reported from the localithy on March 31.

Ray said, “We are conducting the survey in areas where no primary and secondary contacts of positive patients have been detected and based on the findings, we will take a few measures to unseal some areas.”

A district administration source confirmed that more than 4,000 households have been surveyed and the administration is planning to free some areas from the containment zone once the Eid celebrations are over. “A total of 4,000 families residing at Purani Ranchi, Lake Road, Chhota Talab, Noor Nagar, Mali Tola and parts of Nizam Nagar might be taken out of containment zone after the celebrations. Around 23 samples have been already collected from symptomatic patients from these areas and the administration may announce an order in a day or two over releasing the areas from the containment zone,” the source added.

So far, Ranchi fared well on all five parameters set by the Union health ministry to cross over to the orange zone. The parameters are based on total active cases, active cases per lakh population, doubling rate in the last seven days, patient fatality rate, testing ratio and sample positivity rate.

Ray said till Saturday, Ranchi had detected a total of 112 cases of which 97 have been cured and discharged and 15 cases are active. He, however, added that 600 samples are yet to be tested from the city and the health authorities have been asked to expedite the process.

SSP Anish Gupta said people should be cautious and should not think that restrictions in the ongoing Lockdown 4.0 will be relaxed. He said, “We have received inputs on people assembling at various places in clear violation of the norms. I appeal to them to follow the rules and stay safe by staying indoors.” Gupta added, “I request everyone to refrain from posting objectionable posts on social media as police have already registered 20 cases against several people and the offenders will be dealt with as per the law.”

Families of brides, grooms and guests have to follow standard operating procedures (SOPs) once they get permission to solemnise a marriage , the administration officials said.

Explaining the SOP , DC Mukesh Kumar said the number of people cannot exceed 50 people at a marriage venue and masks are a must for everyone, including the bride and the groom. There is a complete ban on serving liquor, paan or tobacco. The entrance gates should have thermal scanners compulsorily and no DJs or music will be allowed after 10pm. Social distancing should be maintained and video footages of the event should be submitted to the administration. Moreover, baraatis coming from outside the state must take special permission, he added.

Kumar said the guidelines are set up ahead of the marriage season. “One has to seek permission by submitting a formal requisition along with invitation cards with details of the bride and the groom to the sub-divisional magistrate (SDM) and the additional collector. These are guidelines for the safety of everyone.”

The marriage season formally begins on Saturday and continue till June 30. With many marriages postpone since imposition of lockdown in March, many residents in the district are not keen to delay it further. They are likely to take permission to solemnise the events on the nearly eight auspicious days during season.

A businessman, Gopal Murarka, said the marriage of his son, Saurabh, is fixed on June 18. He said, “We welcome the administration’s move, but there is a confusion over booking the venue as the owners are not ready rent it out due to lack of clarity on number of people allowed to attend. It is not clear if the specified 50 people are inclusive of caterers or guests. Let’s see how it goes.”

460,['24/05/2020'],#LifeInTheLockdown: The joy of cooking for my daughter Viya is unparalleled: Anchor Ravi,"I can’t remember how many days it has been since I’ve been at home now, but life has been good.For the longest time, I’ve prayed to God for some free time to spend with my family and now that I have it in abundance, it took a while to get used to it. My profession involves meeting new people everyday, and a lot of human interaction where people are running around or shouting on the sets and letting their creativity flow. So the initial part of the lockdown wasn’t easy for me to adapt to. But over time, my family and I have found our groove.The best part of this lockdown has been spending time with my four-year-old daughter, Viya . My whole day revolves around her and I’m making the most of the quality father-daughter time that we’re getting to spend together. She is an absolute live wire and keeps me on my toes all the time. I’m also virtually catching up with my TV buddies, Pradeep (Machiraju), Anasuya (Bharadwaj), and we keep giving each other advice on what to do to kill time during this quarantine period.I’ve used this time to develop a new skill — cooking . Before the lockdown, if someone had asked me to cook for them, I would’ve, at best, come up with an omelet. But now I’ve watched videos online and have learnt to cook dishes like mutton curry, chicken fry, egg fried rice , etc.The other day, I had prepared crab curry too and everyone loved it, including my daughter. Even though I was left with four cuts on my hand while washing and marinating the crab, the joy of seeing my daughter enjoy something I made was amazing. Now that I have gotten used to cooking, I think I will cook on weekends even after the lockdown is over.Apart from cooking, I’ve also started gardening in my cute little balcony. Plants are full of positive energy and gardening is one of the best ways to kill time.Coming to terms with the coronavirus pandemic has been hard for all of us but we must look at things in a positive light and be thankful for the time we’re getting to spend with our loved ones. This pandemic has taught us to be content with the little things we have and find joy in the smallest of things. It will help us all improve as individuals once things normalise again.",tv,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-75926521,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-228814/75926521.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//tv/news/telugu/lifeinthelockdown-the-joy-of-cooking-for-my-daughter-viya-is-unparalleled-anchor-ravi/articleshow/75926521.cms
461,['24/05/2020'],KMC lacked plan to buffer Amphan impact: Sovan,"Kolkata: Former mayor Sovan Chatterjee on Saturday said he was “pained” to see the performance of Kolkata Municipal Corporation in the aftermath of a supercyclone, a remark that has upset veterans in the Trinamool Congress.

“Treatment started only after the patient was on ventilator,” Chatterjee told a private television channel to underline his belief of “serious gaps” in KMC preparedness. “I say this not to embarrass or belittle anyone. Everyone was aware of Amphan. Weathermen had been predicting the cyclone for six-seven days. I believe the KMC couldn’t gauge the gravity of the situation,” he said.

Speaking from his experience of handling the Aila in 2009, the former mayor underscored the lack of a plan to buffer the impact of Amphan. “I was stunned to see Southern Avenue waterlogged for hours and refuse to believe that Kolkata doesn’t have the wherewithal to flush out the water. It pained me to know from the media that 12-14 pumping stations in the city out of a total 74 didn’t operate. The KMC should have opened all the gates because Ganga went on low tide after 8pm that day.”

Chatterjee also refused to buy the KMC argument for delay in clearing uprooted trees. “The KMC says its men who could handle electric saws had gone back to their home states, but there are agencies that can handle such a situation. The fire department has means. So, does the disaster management wing of Kolkata Police and the NDRF. There are contractors too... Worse, the KMC doesn’t have a clue about the total number of trees felled by the storm. It says 2,000 today and 5,000 the next day.”

The former mayor took a dig at the administration over power disruptions too. “I don’t agree uprooted trees and waterlogging have hit power supply in the city. The CESC caters to 70% of its consumers through underground cables. Yes, there are chances of tripping during a supercyclone. It is the KMC’s duty to help CESC navigate the problem with adequate information,” he said, paving the way for a fresh debate on civic performance.

462,['24/05/2020'],Didi lays out roadmap to get S 24 Parganas back on its feet,"Kakdwip (South 24 Parganas): The Bengal government has ordered a joint damage assessment survey by departments in sectors like agriculture, irrigation, fisheries, animal husbandry, power, forest and environment. Three major arterial roads in South 24 Parganas , namely Baruipur-Canning Road, Sonarpur-Kheyadah Road and Fatehpur-Falta Road, are yet to come back to normal.

Chief minister Mamata Banerjee has asked departments to submit a comprehensive report within a week. “Make a detailed report to the central teams when they come to Bengal for damage assessment,” the CM told South 24 Parganas district magistrate P Ulaganathan.

Trinamool MLA from Gosaba Jayanta Naskar gave a slice of the devastation at the South 24 Parganas administrative meeting presided over by the CM. Naskar pointed out that vast stretches of the embankment along the Raimangal river have been wiped out spread over four gram panchayats, namely Amtali, Chhoto Mollakhali, Lahiripur and Rangabelia. “Villages are under saline water. Women can’t cook, neither can they bathe. They have no drinking water. Dead fishes are floating in the ponds spreading bad smell in the localities. These areas need 40 tube wells to provide sweet water,” Naskar said. Trinamool MLA from Canning Purba Saokat Molla asked for tarpaulins because 96% of people in his assembly segment are living in the open.

The CM urged the district administration to take up reconstruction work on a war footing. “You have done a commendable job by rescuing three lakh people in the district. That is why the death toll in the district is 13. The second part is reconstruction. The administration should take up reconstruction of the 10 lakh damaged houses on a priority basis. We have granted 1.4 lakh projects under the Bangla Abas Yojana. I don’t want to hear complaints on individual house building. I have asked the public health engineering department to distribute drinking water pouches in the localities till things come back to normal,” she said.

According to primary estimates, as many as 41,667 electric poles have been uprooted only in South 24 Parganas and 51 power substations have been damaged. The CM advised the administration to hire generators and provide drinking water to households for some time. “I say this because such huge number of electric poles can’t be transported due to lockdown. Yet, I would urge the transport department to run buses so that people can join the reconstruction work. The administration should engage locals others those enrolled MNREGS to carry the poles, or digging the ground to instal the light posts as part of convergence,” Banerjee said.

The CM then harped on embankment repair because 56 kilometres of embankment in this riverine stretch have been wiped out, affecting 310 gram panchayats under 29 blocks. “I would urge you to spend money judiciously. Set up a common pool of funds with the money from departments, zilla parishad, panchayat samitis to ensure that agencies work under a common plan. There is no need of taking up big projects. Take up small projects like repair of embankments, laying of village roads, restoring electricity. WBSEB officials have a major role to play. We have to finish the work before the onset of monsoons. See to it that we don’t have to undertake repairs after the rains,” the CM said at the meeting.

And, in an irony of sorts, the patients hit hardest by Amphan ’s after-effect are those laid low by the novel coronavirus.Cyclone Amphan has had a devastating effect on internet connectivity and cellphone services, dealing a body blow to Covid patients’ treatment across private hospitals in Kolkata. Other than consultation with doctors, which have been largely dependent on remote access, hospitals have been struggling to contact Covid patients’ families for treatment consent.Covid test reports, which are usually sent via the e-route (e-mail or WhatsApp), have also not reached hospitals since the cyclone struck on Wednesday, stalling Covid suspects’ treatment as well as non-Covid patients’ surgeries. Partial restoration of internet and cell phones allowed some hospitals to resume communication on Saturday but the disruption has been a crippling blow, say hospital managements.All interaction between Covid hospitals and patients’ families have been restricted to phone and internet for the last two months. The current disruption has left patients marooned and hospitals groping in the dark. Peerless Hospital, which has 19 Covid patients, has not been able to communicate with their families to apprise them of treatment or seek consent for future action. “Almost all family members are quarantined and cannot visit us. They depend on phones to know about patients’ condition. Phone services are now down but, since treatment cannot wait, we are being forced to go ahead without consent,” Peerless medical superintendent Sudipto Mitra said.As many as 12 patients lined up for surgery at Peerless have been asked to wait since their Covid reports have not arrived. The hospital has its own lab but has run out of kits, forcing it to depend on private laboratories that have mostly shut after the cyclone. AMRI Hospitals, which has 65 Covid patients across three units, has not received any Covid report since the cyclone. Here, too, several surgeries have been put on hold because of the pending reports even as the hospital is desperately trying to get in touch with patients’ families.AMRI labs at its Salt Lake and Dhakuria units have run out of kits as well. “With internet down, private labs are not being able to send the reports. This has held back surgeries and delayed confirmation of Covid suspects. We expect fresh kits to arrive at our labs now and that will at least revive the flow of reports,” AMRI CEO Rupak Barua said. He added that the hospital had decided to go ahead with Covid treatment without waiting for patients’ families’ approval.The delay in reports has “temporarily set back treatment of Covid suspects at RN Tagore Internartional Institute of Cardiac Sciences (RTIICS), leading to anxiety for the patients and their families”. “But treatment has been continued, depending on the clinical presentation of the patient as well as all other lab and diagnostic parameters,” zonal director R Venkatesh said.“Some of our partner labs, which have been supporting us with Covid reports, have suffered major destruction to their physical infrastructure as well as network capabilities. They have been facing challenges in reporting and dispatching Covid tests. But they have somehow resumed operations now and are dispatching pending reports. Teir response has been commendable,” Venkatesh added.All surgeries at Ruby General Hospital were cancelled on Wednesday and Thursday even as the hospital struggled to establish contact with patients’ families.",kolkata,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-75933980,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-112903,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/after-covid-amphan-derails-hospital-ops/articleshow/75928722.cms

MIDNAPORE: A second-year student of IIEST , Shibpur, died under questionable circumstances at his Midnapore town home on Saturday.

Family members found Debdeep Metya, 20, lying without clothes and “unresponsive” on the floor of his room. He was rushed to Midnapore Medical College and Hospital (MMCH), where doctors declared him “dead on arrival”.

The body has been sent for autopsy and police have registered an unnatural death case.

Elder brother Suvankarsaid Debdeep began his studies at IIEST in 2018. He had returned home since the lockdown began on March 25.

Their father Chanchal said Debdeep went up to his room after dinner on Friday and bolted the door from inside, which was unusual.

Kotwali IC Partha Sarathi Paul and DSP Sabyasachi Sengupta inspected the room. “We will examine the youth’s phone and laptop to find a possible explanation for his death,” said a senior officer.

With Amphan leaving a trail of severe devastation across eight districts, the state would “need these days for relief work to take people back home from railway stations”, the CM said.“We are not allowing Shramik Specials to the state till May 26. We require these two days to clear trees from village roads before we take them back home from railway stations. We will be taking trains from May 27,” she said, adding that the government won’t shift migrant workers coming from other states and those coming by flight to quarantine centres.The government, instead, wants them to give an undertaking that they will stay in home quarantine for 14 days.“I am hearing that domestic flights will be on from May 25. Those coming from other states may stay at home because that is the best quarantine centre. The government is not setting up quarantine centres for them because we don’t have the infrastructure following the devastations all around. Even school buildings are not safe. They have developed cracks. From now, home is your quarantine centre,” the CM said.“Home quarantine is the best. We will ask you to give an undertaking stating that you will stay at home for the prescribed period. The state health department will keep a watch on them by tracking cell phone towers to ensure that they don’t step out of their homes,” she added.The CM said Bengal migrants coming from other states won’t have to wait for hours for health screening before they can go home. “It takes at least five to 10 minutes to take swab samples. The process takes hours if thousands of migrants come at a time. People run out of patience. We have decided to let them go home after checking their body temperatures with thermal guns. Districts will do their health screening after they reach home,” she said.The CM lauded the model adopted in some villages to keep people in quarantine. “In some villages, locals have identified a place for these people.

HYDERABAD: The stigma of being a Covid-19 patient has not withered away even as India completes two months in lockdown. Social media has many videos of neighbours applauding those who have recovered from the virus attack and returned home. But these images hide the painful fact that hundreds of others must learn to live with being treated as pariahs even after being cured.Sniggered at by neighbours, they are often looked down upon or shunned whenever they step out to buy groceries or essential items.A 58-eight-year-old man, who was discharged from Gandhi Hospital in early May, says it has been a bitter two weeks ever since he has come back home. “No one in my colony even says hello to me. I am shunned wherever I go. Some of the residents even asked our watchman to not step out when I pass by. Is it a crime to be a Covid patient?” he sought to know.A 43-year-old man feels the same. A resident of Suryapet market area where a large number of coronavirus cases were reported, he is unable to digest the way society treats him. “I finished my home quarantine recently after treatment. To my shock, a local corporator along with two officials came knocking my door and asked me to vacate my home. They insisted I stay in some other place or go to Hyderabad. They said they will make arrangements. I am wondering why I was discharged,” he said.He said he is healthy like any other person and was discharged only after he tested negative twice. “But, society, gripped in unknown fears , is not ready to accept this fact,” he rued. Ramesh (name changed), who hails from Bihar but resides in Hyderabad’s Old City, lost his job once it became known that he was Covid-19 positive. He was working in a milk booth. His employer removed him and did not pay him his April salary. “It’s ok. But, I had to shift to a new locality because of people’s behaviour towards me. I am now searching for a new job,” he said.Several other patients feel they have been wronged by society. A 36-year-old man from Khammam says he sees fear in the eyes of people. “Life for others during the lockdown is normal, but I have to live with the stigma that I am a coronavirus patient. Why can’t people accept it like any other disease,” he wondered.More than 1,000 people have been discharged in Telangana after undergoing the treatment for coronavirus. Some of them have created their own chat group to stay in touch and support one another. “When we were in the hospital, we created this group. Now, we enquire about one another’s health,” Akhil (24) of Warangal Urban district said.A 35-year-old resident of Jiyaguda in the Old City sounds optimistic after contracting the virus.

469,['24/05/2020'],"Karnataka: Property registration picks up pace, Rs 253 crore in government kitty since April 24","Representative image

BENGALURU: Karnataka 's retail real estate market is slowly emerging from the Covid-19 slump, going by the revenue generated from property transactions in one month of operations during the lockdown.

Officials said the government has mopped up Rs 253 crore since all sub-registrar offices, barring three, resumed registration of properties from April 24 amid various restrictions. Till May 21, a total of 68,000 documents have been registered of which 60% are related to property. The average revenue generated in the period, officials said, works out to Rs 15 crore a day. In peak season, it averages at Rs 40 crore - Rs 45 crore a day.

About 60% of the registrations are in Bengaluru and neighbouring districts, officials said. With home loan EMIs set to turn cheaper after RBI's rate cut, the government is expecting revenue from registrations to go up to Rs 20 crore per day by May-end and Rs 25 crore in June.

""The data suggests that some buoyancy may be returning to the real estate market. We may end up collecting more revenue than the target estimated in the budget,""said KP Mohan Raj, inspector general of registrations and commissioner of stamps.

Property registration helps K’taka earn Rs 15 cr every day’

The state government has set a revenue collection target of Rs 12,655 crore in the 2020-21 fiscal year, which is about Rs 35 crore per day from stamps and registrations.

Officials said Karnataka has been doing better than its neighbours so far: “While we are netting average revenue of Rs 15 crore per day, Tamil Nadu and Telangana have been earning Rs 10 crore and Rs 6 crore, respectively. The sub-registrar offices opened at the same time as ours in these states.” Across Karnataka, 242 sub-registrar offices are functional.

“Over 70% of revenue is generated through sale of flats and plots while 30% of the documents are gift deeds or related to marriages, partition, and mortgage,” said an official of the stamps and registration department.

“The current sales after partial easing is 20% of normal. Our completed projects are seeing greater traction. Construction schedules will get affected though we are confident of maintaining RERA timelines for our projects. The impact of labourers going back is still unknown,” said Rajendra Joshi, CEO (residential) of Brigade Enterprises. “The government can help us by reducing stamp duty and allowing developers to pay only a nominal part of fees at the time of approvals.”

CHANDIGARH: The Punjab and Haryana high court has made it clear that the imposition of restrictions on opening of religious institutions constitutes “paternalistic act” and such restrictions are in collective interest of the society.

The high court also made it clear that the right to freedom of religion is subject to public order, morality and public health . “It is an extraordinary situation. In order to safeguard the health of the society, restrictions have been imposed by closing down all the places of worship for public, including holding of religious congregations/gatherings. The restrictions imposed are reasonable based on objectivity and do not amount to interference in the religious affairs of any community,” the HC held.

Petition had challenged curbs on opening of religious institutions

It also observed that relaxations in restrictions in certain areas cannot be a ground to relax the same qua religious places of worship. The discretion not to permit opening of all the places of worship for public and prohibiting holding of religious congregations/ gatherings has been exercised judiciously.

The division bench, comprising Justice Rajiv Sharma and Justice Ajay Tewari, has passed the order while dismissing a petition filed by Mubeen Farooqi, president, Muslim Federation of Punjab, Malerkotla.

The petition was against the restrictions on opening of religious institutions during the lockdown. It was averred that Ramzan is the most sacred month of the year for Islamic culture. Muslims observe the month of Ramzan to mark that Allah or God gave the first chapter of the Quran to the Prophet Muhammad in 610.

According to the petitioner, mosque/idgah is the best place to offer prayer during Ramzan and the period can be restricted to one hour for offering jamaat/ namaz of Eid-ul-fitr and dua. The petition averred that the places of worship i.e mosques/idgahs, gurdwaras and temples, can also be opened since shops and markets have been permitted to open by maintaining social distancing. He also claimed that the closure of religious institutions violated his fundamental rights and prayed that all the religious places be ordered open.

Vehemently opposing the petition, the counsel for the Union government and the Punjab government submitted that there is no violation of fundamental rights of the petitioner and the restrictions have been imposed in larger public interest.

“The restrictions imposed by the ministry of home affairs (MHA) do not violate any fundamental or legal right of the petitioner or the similarly situated persons. The endeavour of the MHA is to break the cycle by maintaining social distancing. We will not substitute our wisdom for the wisdom of the executive decision, which has been taken in the larger public interest,” the high court said while dismissing plea against closure of religious institutions during lockdown.

CHENNAI: DMK organisational secretary and Rajya Sabha member R S Bharathi was let off on interim bail till June 1 by the principal sessions court, hours after city police arrested him on Saturday.

Condemning the arrest, DMK president M K Stalin said the party could not be cowed by such intimidations. ""The AIADMK government has taken up a case after 100 days (after his speech) under the SC/ST (Prevention of Atrocities) Act. The government has arrested him after he had given an explanation and apologised for what he had spoken. Neither can the chief minister nor the ringmasters remote controlling him divert the DMK's work to uplift SC/STs and social justice,"" said Stalin.

Chief Minister Edappadi K Palaniswami , however, denied the allegation and said there was no political intention or interference in Bharathi's arrest. ""He has been arrested for his inflammatory speech about a Madras high court judge and it's a police action based on an individual's complaint,"" he said.

A team of central crime branch personnel picked up Bharathi up from his residence in the early hours of Saturday, in connection with a speech he had delivered at an indoor meeting. He had reportedly remarked that it was due to the Dravidian rule that many from oppressed sections became judges.

Soon after his arrest, a battery of DMK lawyers, including senior counsel P Wilson and N R Elango, who themselves are Rajya Sabha members of the party, rushed to principal sessions judge Selvakumar's residence to pre-empt remanding of Bharathi in judicial custody.

""Though the case was originally registered at the Teynampet police station on May 22, it was transferred to Chennai CCB later. The investigating officer arrested Bharathi immediately without any further probe,"" they submitted. Bharathi has already approached the Madras HC offering to surrender before the special court for MPs and MLAs if the usual direction to the trial court to consider his bail application on the same day was issued, they added.

Countering the arguments, state public prosecutor A Natarajan said since the case falls under the SC/ST Act, the complainant has to be heard and no order can be passed without hearing him.

Recording the submissions, the sessions judge said a remand could be refused only when there is no prima facie case from the prosecution records. Remanding him till June 5, the judge granted the interim relief with a direction that Bharathi surrender before the court on June 1. The relief was granted on two grounds - pending petition of Bharathi in the HC to quash the FIR, and the fact that his family members are doctors involved in Covid-19 work and therefore, sending him to jail would put other inmates at the risk of infection.

474,['24/05/2020'],"For Rs 3k, packed trucks are sneaking migrant workers out of Noida","Noida: The desperation of migrant workers has spawned an illegal transportation industry in Noida. For anything between Rs 3,000 and Rs 5,000, those driving trucks, loaders and private buses are smuggling workers home. Social distancing is not even a possibility in the cramped spaces at the back of the trucks or overloaded buses.

Just this month, Noida police have seized 30 trucks and loaders and arrested their owners for attempting to carry migrants without passes to their home districts in UP and home state in Bihar. Taking the Mahamaya flyover, the trucks and loaders go past the Sector 62 crossing, Chilla border, Sector 51, Phase II and Pari Chowk.

Inside, at first glance, the trucks appear to be transporting goods under tarpaulin and cloth covers, tightly packed. But somewhere beneath the covers are found migrant workers. “In one truck seized on Sunday, 10 migrant workers were hiding beneath packed goods. They were from UP and Bihar. We booked the driver for lockdown violation,” station house officer of the Sector 39 police station, Shailesh Tomar, told TOI. Then on Tuesday, a mini truck was found transporting 10 labourers to Bihar from central Noida, DCP (central Noida) Harish Chander said.

Then there are private buses that try and transport workers home without passes. On Wednesday night, a bus carrying 54 workers to Bihar was caught on the way. “In the bus, too, no social distancing norm was being followed. About Rs 1 lakh was seized, money that had been collected from the passengers,” a police officer said. DCP Chander said the driver, conductor and another accomplice was arrested.

The migrant workers were sent to a shelter home.

HUBBALLI: While scientists and researchers are toiling to develop a vaccine and potentially, a cure, for Covid-19 , villagers in North Karnataka are turning to an ancient ruse to ward the disease from their vicinity. Like Plegamma and Maramma- goddesses of plague and chicken pox respectively - who were thrown out of village limits by their fathers and grandfathers, villagers last week did the honours for ' Coronamma '.""It's like an online challenge,"" explained T Onkarappa, a farmer and PhD student in Hulikere village of Kudligi taluk in Ballari. ""Residents of the village adjoining us transferred the goddess to ours. We then took it forward, performed puja and sent the goddess to the next village, Saklapurada Hatti . Village elders decide on an auspicious time for the procession and drummers pass the word around. All residents clean their houses, prepare sweets to offer to the goddess and gather at a given place. We then pray to the goddess to go away from us and take her to the next village. Many villages are part of such rituals. When chikungunya was haunting people, villagers sent Kuntamma (goddess of laming) out of the village.""Anjanappa HK, a resident of Chikka Kumbalagunte, said his village too is planning to hold such a puja soon. ""Such send-offs are given during healthcare emergencies. We also celebrate 'holigemma' (after holige, a sweet dish) to welcome rains every year.""A run Joladkudligi, a postdoctoral fellow at Kannada University, Hampi, said coronavirus was only the latest pathogen to be identified with a mother-goddess who could be pacified to bestow health on people.“All such deities are female, in keeping with the Shakta cult of Dravidian culture. In a state of panic, people turn to a mother figure to shelter them and keep them safe.”“Such practices are an attempt to reassure communities to mitigate the anxiety and panic created during a natural disaster. Healthcare workers can use such occasions to create awareness among villagers,” said psychiatrist Dr Shivanand Hiremath.Dr Ravindra Vaidya, an ayurveda practitioner, said such rituals foster awareness at one level.“Villagers use neem leaves to carry the statue of the goddess. Neem has antiseptic and antiviral properties. And Ayurveda says neem’s bitter slop is a sanitiser. Tamarind, another main component of such rituals, also has anti-viral properties. So they do realise the importance of disinfection and sanitising. People usually make nutritious delicacies using jaggery as the main ingredient which helps boost immunity.

BENGALURU: When the UP-bound Shramik Special carrying 1,450 workers from Bengaluru on Thursday reached its destination, the passengers thought they were home. But the train was in Ghaziabad, abutting Delhi, and not Basti as scheduled. Stranded without food for more than 20 hours, the workers said they have no clue when they will be home.

The train to Basti left Chikkabanavara station in Bengaluru at 6.45pm on Thursday. The workers were to reach home on Saturday night, at the end of a 2,456km journey for which they shelled out Rs 1,020 (Rs 875 train fare plus Rs 145 bus fare). The scheduled route: Secunderabad, Nagpur, Itarsi (MP), Jhansi, Kanpur and Lucknow. The journey takes 45 hours. However, the train was diverted from Jhansi and reached Ghaziabad, passengers said around 7pm on Saturday.

Railway Board chairman VK Yadav said 80% of Shramik trains go to UP and Bihar, leading to congestion, necessitating diversion.

‘They haven’t eaten for 20 hrs’

Passengers said they weren’t told about the change. “We haven’t eaten since the train crossed Nagpur station on Friday night,” said Akhilesh Chauhan, a passenger. “People living close to the railway tracks have been bringing us water in buckets to drink. We were supposed to reach by Saturday night.” Many passengers sent photographs and videos to STOI, showing tired travellers sitting in huddles, wondering what to do. Basti is still about 14 hours and nearly 700km away.

Narendra Kumar, who helped arrange tickets for around 50 migrants, said: “I received a call saying the train is being diverted. They haven’t eaten for 20 hours and don’t know whether the train will reach the destination.”

After STOI informed Bengaluru divisional railway manager Ashok Kumar Verma, he spoke to his counterpart and food and water were arranged for the passengers.

Sources said several trains are being diverted due to heavy congestion in UP.

Five more deaths, all in Chennai, took the state toll to 103.While the state recorded 759 new cases, Chennai recorded one of its highest single-day increases of 624 cases, taking its tally to 9,989. The spillover continued in adjoining districts — Chengalpet logged 39 cases, Tiruvallur had 17 and Kancheepuram reported 13. Seven people who returned from London and five from Philippines tested positive, besides 37 others from Maharashtra, Rajasthan, West Bengal, Delhi, Uttar Pradesh, Telangana and Andhra Pradesh. The remaining 17 cases were in other districts. In the Covid-19 control room, health experts and officials said were preparing for a likely surge in Covid-19 count in the coming days. “We are preparing for the worstcase scenario that has predicted over lakh cases of hospitalisation. We don’t know if we will see that many cases. But we want to be prepared,” said health secretary Beela Rajesh.All government hospitals, health secretary Beela Rajesh said, will be able to offer elective surgeries and other services without hindrance when the lockdown is relaxed. “We too will learn to treat with Covid,” she said.It took nearly two months for the state to get to the first 5,000 cases, but in the next 16 days it added 10,000 cases. In May, the state recorded 13,313 cases and 76 deaths. Yet, it managed to bring down the mortality rate drastically. “That’s the silver lining. We have mortality of around 0.6% and it’s the lowest in the country. Our recovery rate is climbing to nearly 50% now. On Sunday, our team proudly shared our treatment protocol with several states on directions from the Centre,” she said.The state has been able to detect cases quickly, bring them to hospitals when they are still presymptomatic, bring comorbidities under control while they are treated. Before sending patients for home isolation, doctors ensure a battery of tests is conducted though they are asymptomatic, says Rajiv Gandhi Government General Hospital dean Dr R Jayanthi. The state’s tertiary hospital has treated more than 2,200 patients —more than 600 had comorbidities where the mortality rate is 1.5%. “We have helped patients with dual transplants, cancer and renal failure recover because of intense monitoring,” she said. Most hospitals have made minimum use of ventilators and, instead, used high flow oxygen and prone nursing (asking people to sleep on their stomach to increase oxygen levels).Nearly 85% of the 103 deaths occurred within the first week of hospitalisation. “ Most patients had advanced stages of chronic ailments, uncontrolled diabetes or hypertension. Many of them were critical and did not live for more than an hour,” said a senior doctor. While 35 patients died with one day, 25 more died within the next 48 hours. Of the 103 patients, 87 of them died within a week.

CHENNAI: J Jayalalithaa 's niece Deepa Jayakumar has opposed the Tamil Nadu government 's ordinance to take over the late chief minister's residence 'Veda Nilayam' at Poes Garden in Chennai and sought the support of AIADMK cadres to stop the move.

Talking to TOI on Saturday, she wondered why the government was attempting to convert 'Veda Nilayam' into a memorial, when one was being constructed on the Marina. ""Nobody is aware what is available inside 'Veda Nilayam' and it would be justice on part of the government to hand over the property to the legal heirs, who are my brother and I. We will maintain it very well,"" she said. Pointing out that the issue is sub-judice, Jayalalithaa's niece asked, ""What is the urgency to promulgate an ordinance when the country is crippled by the coronavirus crisis.""

In a strongly worded statement later, she appealed to AIADMK cadres to ""Help me to fight for my legitimate rights and get us our 'Veda Nilayam' house back and ensure that nobody, Edappadi K Palaniswami or O Paneerselvam or any bureaucrat, touches a single stone or any object in the house that belonged to my aunt.""

Jayalalithaa's clothes, jewellery, books, furniture, valuables and cars at Poes Garden should be kept intact until the legal heirs are allowed to inspect the house with a court order, Deepa Jayakumar said.

Her remarks come a day after governor Banwarilal Purohit promulgated an ordinance to temporarily take possession of 'Veda Nilayam' and movable items, besides establishing a foundation to convert the house into a memorial. While the chief minister would be chairperson of the foundation, the deputy chief minister and minister for information would its members.

483,['24/05/2020'],Cyclone ravages hub of urban wildlife and birding,"Kolkata: Cyclone Amphan has taken its toll on one of the key urban biodiversity hubs of south Kolkata.

Popularly known as Koyaler Bagan among birders, wildlife biologists and field researchers, the Chintamani Kar Bird Sanctuary — located in Narendrapur — has lost trees spread over more than half of its area on Wednesday night, when cyclone Amphan had struck the city.

Senior foresters said trees spread over more than eight acres — the sanctuary spans over 16.5 acres — were damaged.

This is, however, only a fraction of the 1,600 sq kilometres damaged within the sanctuary and forest areas of South and North 24 Parganas, Nadia, Murshidabad and East Midnapore after the cyclone.

“We are yet to assess the exact number of trees lost at Chintamani Kar Sanctuary, but the loss is huge. More than half of the entire sanctuary area has suffered damage,” said chief wildlife warden Ravi Kant Sinha, adding that the sanctuary — originally an orchard — comprises mostly mango and banyan trees.

According to conservationist Arjan Basu Roy of Nature Mates-Nature Club, the sanctuary houses more than 114 species of birds and over 80 species of butterflies. “Acquired by the forest department in 2003 from the Koyals, the erstwhile owners of the orchard, it was named Chintamani Kar Bird Sanctuary after the renowned sculptor, who fought, along with others, for its sanctuary status,” said Basu Roy, adding that he is associated with the place — considered to be the cradle of urban wildlife photography and research — for more than 35 years.

According to Basu Roy, predominantly a mango orchard, the sanctuary also houses trees like banyan, litchi, longan (anshphal), roseapple and jackfruit.

“Some of the trees are 70-100 years old. It also houses bamboo groves,” added Basu Roy.

City-based birders have rued the loss. According to Siddhartha Dey of birding group LensnWings: “It’s a huge habitat loss, particularly for the resident birds in this nesting season.” The place also houses various species of snakes, including checkered keelback, striped keelback, common bronze back, painted bronze back and common wolf snake, among others. The venomous species found here include monocled cobra, common krait and Russell’s viper. It’s also home to golden jackal, grey mongoose, jungle cat, Asian palm civet and water monitor lizard. Sighting of Bengal monitor lizard has also been reported from here.

Basu Roy added that presence of many species of frogs also makes it a biodiversity hotspot.

Written by a group of doctors from AIIMS Raipur, it said: “Mobile phone surfaces are a peculiar ‘high-risk’ surface, which can directly come in contact with the face or mouth, even if hands are properly washed and one study indicates that some healthcare workers use phones every 15 minutes to two hours.”In wake of the same, they recommended restrictions on use of mobile phones in healthcare institutions besides warning that such devices can be a potential carrier of the virus.Health experts, however, have questione the move. “I don’t find the move logical.

MUMBAI: Thirty-four-year old Shashank Prabhu, chief mentor at a coaching institute, and Ankit Thakker (24), a chemical engineer , bagged the top two positions in the MBA/MMS CET conducted by the state for admission to business schools , reports Yogita Rao.

The state’s CET cell announced the results on Saturday amidst the lockdown, after a delay of almost two months. Around 1.1 lakh students had appeared for the test this March—7,000 more than last year.

The number of students who scored between 151 and 175 dropped to four this year from 20 last year. There has been a 40% drop in students scoring between 126 and 150 too, from 677 to 392.

Many found the paper lengthy, said Ankit. While Shashank scored 159 out of 200, Ankit stood second in the state with 155. The percentile of both was 99.99, though. A total of 16 students scored 99.99.

It was Ankit’s second attempt. The Chembur boy cleared his chemical engineering from the Institute of Chemical Technology in 2018, worked for a year before focusing on the entrance exam. JBIMS is his top choice among institutes, he told TOI. He studied on his own and relied on mock tests for practice, he said.

For Shashank, cracking CET with the top score is not a new accomplishment—he has done it twice before. This year, he scored 99.99 percentile for the sixth time.

Shashank said mathematics was slightly easy, while the visual reasoning section was slightly difficult.

Usually, the results are announced by March-end. The CET cell is yet to announce the schedule for the admission process.

AHMEDABAD: Amid heightened controversy over non-payment of fares for returning migrant workers, the Gujarat government has committed to pay its share of fare for 7,512 out of total 22.5 lakh migrant workers from other states, as per the note filed by the state in Gujarat high court .

After going through the government’s note, the HC in its order on Saturday said, “The travel charges levied for the transportation of the migrant workers by the railway authorities is borne by a few host states, NGOs, employers and voluntary associations. This is not done. We direct the railway authorities to waive off one-way charges of these migrant labourers or in the alternative, for the state government to bear such charges.”

In not paying for others, the state government has cited the Interstate Migrant Workers Act 1979 and claimed that this law is applicable to only registered migrant workers and they are only 7,512 such workers.

The government’s statement reads, “The provisions of the Interstate Migrant Workers Act 1979 are applicable to the registered migrant workers under the said Act. There are 7,512 workers registered under the Act. Based on the available data, there are around 22.5 lakh migrant workers across the state. Most of them have come on their own and provisions for payment of travelling allowance and displacement allowance as required by Sections 14 and 15.

Destination states paying fares

The government further stated that the state’s share for most workers is borne by their native states and not by Gujarat, which claimed to have arranged for transportation facilities. “Further, the states of UP, Odisha and Tamil Nadu have said that they will deposit the payment for travelling charges to the railways directly. No migrant worker has been denied travel on account of nonpayment of travel charges,” the government’s note reads.

The government has claimed before the HC that its labour department has made 18,314 private employers to pay Rs 538.39 crore to approximately 3,98,334 employees against wages for the month of March. Similarly, 378 establishments paid Rs 66.57 crore to approximately 29,244 workers towards April salary.

INDORE: As many as 3,500 small-scale industries, spread in small pockets of the city, have resumed operations amid relaxed lockdown norms, giving a boost to economic revival in the region.

Most industries located at Sanwer Road, Palda, Polo Ground, Nemawar Road and Bardari have resumed operations with skeletal staff and limited capacity utilisation. A small step, but big on hope.

Relaxations allowed by the district administration - especially withdrawing the condition for stay arrangements for workers - helped many industries resume operations. According to the Association of Industries Madhya Pradesh (AIMP), most small and medium scale factories in the industry belts of Indore city have resumed operations at 30% to 40% capacity.

Industry players said relaxed norms, logistics support and extended working hours will give a much-needed boost.

Anil Joshi, manufacturer of copper components on Sanwer Road, said, ""Small-scale industries have many constraints. One was limited space within the premises to make stay arrangements for workers. Once this is relaxed, many units came forward to resume operations.""

Some industrial belts in the city, such as Kila Maidan and Rambali Nagar, are still awaiting permission to resume work.

Pramod Dafaria, president of AIMP, said, ""We have requested the local administration to let all industries function with proper safety measures in order to get back on track. Industries have suffered irreparable damage in the last two months and this needs to be addressed.""

In the wake of worker shortage in some units, the association has sought permission from the administration to send transportation for their workers to bring back to the city. ""Many workers have migrated to their native villages and this is leading to shortage of workers in factories. Looking at this problem, the association, after discussing with its members, has decided to send transportation for workers who are willing to come back,"" Dafaria said.
