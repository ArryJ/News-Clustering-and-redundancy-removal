Looks like music composer Simon K King remained muted on social media platforms during the lockdown to come out with something surprising for his fans and well-wishers. No, this time, it isn’t a music track of the composer that has grabbed the attention of the netizens, but a collage of two of his photos — before and after lockdown looks. “I’ve reduced around 25kg since the start of the lockdown and I am still reducing,” he says, adding, “But this is the weirdest thing for me to talk about. If it’s about music, I can talk on and on. Talking about losing weight is quite new to me.”But prod him slightly, and he talks gushingly about his body transformation. “In February this year, I weighed around 128kg. I never bothered about it. But during the lockdown, I decided to set small goals in terms of reducing weight. I started intending to reduce 3kg to 5kg during the first phase of the lockdown. Then, I aimed at reducing another 5kg in the next phase and so on. That was how it worked.”Simon points out two changes in his lifestyle that has helped him — eating at home and eating on time. “Many musicians like me tend to eat outside food a lot. Thanks to all the food-delivery apps, we get food at the click of a button. Eating at odd times was a big problem. After finishing recording at midnight, I would order whatever I would get at that time. And then, sleep till 11 in the morning and again, have brunch. But during the lockdown, I was able to get rid of that habit and deleted all the food-delivery apps from my phone. During the lockdown, I started eating home-cooked food on time. When my eating habits changed, I started seeing the results. That pushed me to do more workouts. I have always been physically active — playing badminton and swimming, but that didn’t have any effect on my bodyweight because of my eating habits,” he shares.Talking about the initial spark that motivated him to reduce weight, he says, “My wife has been telling me to reduce weight for a long time and then, there’s my trainer Ramnath. He has been after me for almost two to three years. During the lockdown, he gave me high-intensity workouts daily, which I am continuing. He planned a workout routine, which I could do at home —burpees, jumping jacks, skipping, etc. The workouts not only helped me reduce weight, but also strengthened my body.”Meanwhile, Simon reiterates, he believes in body positivity and losing weight shouldn’t stress one out. “Losing or even gaining weight is a health criterion. Sadly, I have come across even kids being bullied for being slightly hefty. The focus need not be on how you look, instead, it should be on health. Set small goals; when you achieve that, you’ll get inspired to do more. Had I set a goal to reduce 10kg at one go, I would have lost interest halfway,” says Simon as we wind up the conversation.",entertainment,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-76914966,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-659350/76914966.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/tamil/movies/news/simon-k-king-opens-up-about-reducing-around-25kg-weight-during-the-lockdown/articleshow/76914966.cms
1,['12/07/2020'],Women cops on Bullets feel empowered and are much-appreciated,"Women police officers going around on Bullets on Covid-19 surveillance duties in Thrissur were making such an impact, ever since the lockdown began in March, that DGP Loknath Behara recently announced their service would be rolled out across the State.The 12 women cops on the team, named Daredevil Riders, are happy to be pioneers. Sharing their experiences with us, they say, “Not only does it help us reach those in quarantine anywhere easily, it also boosts our confidence.”Thrissur City Women’s Police Station SI Sindhu P V, the leader of the team, says Thrissur City Police Commissioner R Adithya had floated the idea of bike ops not only to better aid women, but also to empower the officers and others in the process. “We started the training in February and were planning to start the service soon, and that’s when the Covid-19 pandemic struck. Then, it was decided that our service can be used for Corona surveillance,” she says.The team, who can be contacted on emergency number 1091, has four bullets, with two officers travelling together on duty. While women cops have to take a two-wheeler licence as part of police training, most of them were new to Bullets, Sindhu says. “But we picked it up in a few days,” she says. Helping women who get stranded in the lockdown situations, checking on those in quarantine, reaching help to people living in areas that can’t be accessed on cars or jeeps, taking awareness classes, helping people access grocery services… they do it all.And the Daredevil Riders have heartwarming and LOL experiences to recount. One officer, Bindu T C, says, “Many in quarantine say, ‘Only you care about us now, nobody else wants to come this way.’ There have also been instances when people tip us off when people break quarantine protocols. The reverberating sound of our Bullets has now become familiar even in interior areas, and as soon as people see us, they ensure that social distancing, masks are in place.” Another officer, Sindhu A N, says, “Most people are very cooperative. There are even those who randomly bring us tea upon spotting us on duty. And they say kind words on how it’s a noble service.”The service has emboldened the officers as well, they claim. Jina N V, one of the riders, says, “I was using a scooter before I became part of this group, but not anymore. Riding such a vehicle gives a sense of confidence and seeing people waving at us while riding for duty, inspires us to give our best.” Sindhu P V narrates a funny incident that makes all of them burst into laughter. “Once, we were riding into a very rural area and needed directions. So we stopped at a spot, where quite a few people were standing around. But as soon as we alighted from the Bullets, everyone sprang to their feet, ran and locked themselves in houses and shops! We had to find our own way ahead,” she says with a chuckle.",life-style,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-76888970,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-1338640/76888970.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//life-style/spotlight/women-cops-on-bullets-feel-empowered-and-are-much-appreciated/articleshow/76888992.cms
2,['12/07/2020'],"Neha Gowda: I am not scared, but I am being careful on set","Kannada television 's popular face Neha Gowda , is back on set, albeit for a Tamil serial, Roja , in which she is doing a cameo . In a quick chat with us she talks about her new show, returning to set during the pandemic and more.During the lockdown, I realised just how much I love acting and how badly I wanted to get back to work. I used to tell myself that I was not missing work and not getting bored at home, but on the first day of work on June 23, I woke up at midnight and was waiting to start the shoot.I am doing a guest role on a Tamil serial called Roja, in which my character Nisha appears for about 10-15 episodes. The character is important to the plot and the story. The interesting bit is that it is as good as working on a Kannada serial set, as I am sharing screen space with Vinaya Prasad, Ravi Bhat, Trivikram and Veena Sundar. The serial will be aired after the lockdown is lifted in Chennai.Since the cast includes actors from both Bengaluru and Hyderabad, and the director is from Chennai, once everyone reached Bengaluru, they had to isolate themselves for a few days and follow standard protocols. Even on set, all precautionary steps were in place. Everyone is checked thoroughly and then sent in. Technicians and actors wear masks and we sanitise our hands every five minutes. Given that the pandemic situation is getting worse by the day, we need to follow all precautionary measures laid out by the government and just be positive. I wouldn't say that I am scared, but I am doing my bit to stay safe, like carrying my own cutlery, water bottle and other stuff that I would need in a day.",tv,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-76913902,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-109672/76913902.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//tv/news/kannada/neha-gowda-i-am-not-scared-but-i-am-being-careful-on-set/articleshow/76913755.cms

4,['12/07/2020'],I cannot think of making a film without Anant sir: Hemanth M Rao,"Earlier this year, the Godhi Banna Sadharana Mykattu team announced their next project, Sapta Sagaradaache Yello – a romantic film that was slated to take off sometime in June or July. The pandemic, though, derailed all those plans. ""Thankfully I was still only scripting Sapta Sagaradaache Yello when we announced it. The lockdown gave me time to work on it,"" says director Hemanth M Rao , as we got talking to him over a video chat about the film and more.The title has a literary reference. Tell us more...The title is very apt to my central theme. It was suggested to me by my co-director Gundu Shetty. I usually struggle with titles; it is the last thing I think of. When I was talking to him, he suggested a Gopalakrishna Adiga poem, which was apparently written after he lost his dog. And if one reads the poem carefully, the lines are actually very beautiful. The words struck a chord with me, which led me to take it as the title..The poster launched on leading man Rakshit Shetty ’s birthday has been a talking point, with people deconstructing it. You'd shared some interpretations too... I like the idea of teasing audiences with slight hints; they are intelligent and I need to treat accordingly. I usually consider them more intelligent than I am. So, I wanted to give them that and I liked the idea of this poster because there are many details. There is the character's name, the IPC section under which he is booked, a wallet with a girl's photograph, the money he has, what clothes he is wearing and stuff. It was like a snippet into his background for the story. So, what is clear is that Rakshit plays Manu, he is in prison for a crime and there's a girl's photo in the wallet.Given that it is a romance, people are curious about the female lead.I haven't got to that yet. I usually research a lot for any film and wanted to visit a couple of jails and talk to certain people to understand things better for my story. But because of the current climate, I've not been able to do any of that. So, a major portion of the story is a blank in my head, as I'm yet to understand that world better. Once I see that better, I'll know who would be apt to cast.Will this film be your hat-trick collaboration with Anant Nag For me, it is impossible to think of making a film without Anant sir. But I know I have to offer him a role that is worthy of him. There is something, but right now, I can neither deny nor confirm this.Tell us about Tenali and the reasons for its delay...Tenali is a period film and it happens around the time India gets independence. It is a big canvas. We cannot think of doing that right away. There are various reasons for this. Rakshit has an equally big film in Punyakoti . I will need time to work on a film of this magnitude. So, we will start it after Punyakoti.",entertainment,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-76913710,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-149137/76913710.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/kannada/movies/news/i-cannot-think-of-making-a-film-without-anant-sir-hemanth-m-rao/articleshow/76913710.cms

8,['12/07/2020'],"England vs West Indies, 1st Test: Windies' quicks strike as England collapse","England's Ollie Pope, second right, leaves the field after being dismissed by West Indies' Shannon Gabriel. (A... Read More

SOUTHAMPTON: Alzarri Joseph struck twice and West Indies captain Jason Holder removed England stand-in skipper Ben Stokes as the tourists regained the initiative in the first Test with a late flurry of wickets at Southampton on Saturday.

England were 284/8 in their second innings at the close of the fourth day, a lead of 170 runs in a match that marks international cricket's return from lockdown.

England fought back during a fourth-wicket partnership of 98 between Zak Crawley and Stokes.

But their 249/4 was soon transformed into 279/8 as five wickets fell for just 30 runs inside the final hour.

No sooner had Stokes fallen, then Crawley was caught and bowled by paceman Joseph for a Test-best 76.

Suddenly, England's two batsmen at the crease - Pope and Jos Buttler -- were both on nought.

Buttler, who overturned being lbw to Holder for five, fell for nine when bowled through a huge gap between bat and pad by Joseph.

World Cup-winning wicketkeeper Buttler has now made just one hundred in his 42 Tests.

And there was still time before the close for Windies spearhead quick Shannon Gabriel (3-62) to bowl both Dom Bess and Ollie Pope.

England were still one run behind West Indies' first innings 318 when Crawley came to the crease.

But the 22-year-old, in his fifth Test, completed a well-made fifty when he reverse-swept off-spinner Roston Chase for four.

Crawley, now facing the new ball, topped his previous Test best of 66 against South Africa at Johannesburg in January.

Stokes, skippering the side in the absence of Joe Root, continued to lead from the front by driving Gabriel for four.

The all-rounder had already top-scored with 43 in England's meagre first-innings 204 before the paceman was the pick of the hosts' attack with 4-49.

But for the second time in the match he fell to Holder.

The towering West Indies paceman squared Stokes up and had him caught by Shai Hope, cleverly positioned as the finer of two men in the gully for the left-handed batsman.

It was a tactical as well as personal triumph for Holder, ranked ahead of Stokes as the world's leading Test all-rounder.

There was more joy for the Windies when Crawley, aiming legside, was caught and bowled by Joseph.

England resumed on 15/0 in the first of a three-match behind closed doors series.

Although a batting all-rounder, Chase had taken a Test-best 8-60 when West Indies beat England at his Barbados home ground last year en route to a 2-1 series win.

Chase made the initial breakthrough on Saturday when Rory Burns (42) carelessly cut him to backward point.

Fellow opener Dom Sibley made a painstaking fifty off 161 balls.

The very next delivery saw Sibley play on to Gabriel only for third umpire Michael Gough to rule the bowler had been guilty of a marginal no-ball.

But, two balls later, Sibley - still on 50 -- glanced Gabriel to Dowrich as he was yet again caught down the legside in his fledgling Test career.

Joe Denly, potentially competing for a place with Sibley when Root returns following the birth of his daughter for next week's second Test at Old Trafford, needed a big score to bolster a lowly Test average of under 30.

But instead he fell tamely for 29 when chipping Chase to Holder at short midwicket.

The West Indies had been on top for most of this match, with Holder taking a Test-best 6-42 after losing the toss.

Kraigg Brathwaite then made 65, the opener's first Test fifty in 22 innings, and Dowrich 61 as the tourists established a valuable first-innings lead of 114.

staff safety

The revert to lockdown could not have been more damning for commercial entities and service providers who had just begun struggling to get back on their feet. The worst-hit are restaurateurs and salon owners, who’d just invested on their reopening, only to be shut again. Similarly, autorickshaw drivers and cabbies were hoping to see their income pick up this month after losing almost three months’ income.Though relaxations started mid-June, the government continued to restrict several sectors until July, with the spread of COVID-19 persisting. At the start of this month, the state government relented, showing inclination to unlock more sectors. The salon andwas given permission to resume operations from June 28. But, barely a week into their operations they are faced with another round of having to pull down their shutters.Anand Korhalkar, owner of Passion Unisex Salon on Sinhagad Road, had just invested on PPE kits, sanitisers and thermal scanners, so he could reopen his salon last Sunday.“After the unlocking was announced and we were given permission to resume operations, I purchased all the merchandise needed to ensure customer and. In the one week gone by, we hardly had any footfall but I hung in there in the hope that the business will pick up next week. But now it’s back to lockdown,” he recounted.The fresh lockdown has spelled doom for Ajit Thakur, who runs Archana Men’s Parlour on Paud Road in Kothrud, and he is pushed to considering exiting the business. “There’s been no revenue since March and yet I had to keep paying salaries to my staff. Now even the shop owner is demanding rent. When we were allowed to reopen last Sunday, I’d assured the shop owner that I’d start paying the rent regularly from next month. But the new lockdown has broken my back and I have to consider closing shop completely.”While salons could operate for at least a week, restaurants that were just gearing to up their shutters have been robbed of that opportunity by the lockdown coming up. “When the government announced that there would be no further lockdowns, restaurateurs were encouraged to restock on their raw materials which are perishables, in anticipation of being back in the business. We got permission to reopen only a few days ago, but now the lockdown has come upon us,” pointed out Ganesh Shetty, president of Pune Restaurant and Hoteliers’ Association.Worse, some even called back their staff from their native places in preparation to restart the business. “I called back my staff after the government gave permission. Now that they are here, they cannot go back and I will have to pay them though there will be no income. We’re doing parcel service but the business is just too lean,” said Vishwanath Shetty, owner of Sheetal Hotel on Karve Road.Apart from these businesses, service providers such as autorickshaw drivers and cabbies, who hardly have any financial muscle and were hit by the threemonth long lockdown, are equally devastated by the return to restriction. “I am the sole breadwinner of the family and my income comes purely from driving my rickshaw. With the relaxation, I resumed plying in June but given that people were still keeping off the streets, my income was barely Rs 100-200 a day. Only recently the mobility of citizens had improved and I was expecting July to be more remunerative but the announcement of yet another lockdown has brought on the horrors of struggling through without income that we experienced earlier. Before imposing another lockdown, the government should have given some thought to the financial condition of people like us,” cried 35-year-old Nikesh Gaikwad from Katraj.Cabbies echo that the new lockdown could not have been more illtimed. “Cab services suffered huge losses these past months. Even pursuant to the relaxation people were wary of taking cabs with the threat of the virus still hanging over their heads. With things beginning to return to a certain normalcy we were pinning our hopes on better income in July. But the dream of recuperation has been squashed by the fresh diktat. Clearly, the government has not spared a thought to the plight of the poor,” alleged Jitendra Kamble, a cab driver residing in Vishrantwadi.",pune,"https://static.toiimg.com/photo/imgsize-160172,msid-76915346/76915346.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/locked-out-of-their-businesses-again/articleshow/76917289.cms

15,['12/07/2020'],Iqbal Khan: Why should schools charge fees for the facilities students are not using?,"Over the past few weeks, parents across the country have spoken out against schools for not changing their fee structure during this tough phase. Recently, there were reports of some parents filing a plea in the Supreme Court, seeking moratorium or deferment of payment of fee during the COVID-19 pandemic . They also requested that schools charge fees based on their actual expenditure till the commencement of normal classes Actor Iqbal Khan has also been raising the issue in his own way. A couple of days ago, he posted a video on how eighty percent private schools in our country have not offered any fee deduction, despite classes being conducted online due to the COVID-19 crisis.Iqbal, whose daughter will now enter Class IV, told BT, “It is unfair. Even if they pay the teachers, who are working from home, schools don’t have to ply their buses, run canteens or use electricity in classrooms. Some private schools are even charging for food, swimming pool and track-and-field — facilities no student has availed over the past few months. Why should parents pay for the services that our children are not using? However, even after repeated requests, most schools refuse to reduce the fees.”When asked about the video, he said, “Many parents have paid the fees without any complaints. I think everyone should stand united in situations like these, as our demands are absolutely fair and justified. I want to appeal to fellow parents to support the cause and hence, the video.”Meanwhile, the actor is happy that his alma mater in Kasauli is a rare exception. He said, “The boarding school where I studied, has reduced fees by 30 percent fees. That too, when teachers live on the campus and use facilities like accommodation and mess. If they can reduce fees, why can’t the schools in our city follow suit?” He added, “During this tough phase, everyone has accepted pay cuts. Maybe, our schools, too, should think less about business.”",tv,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-76913749,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-134913/76913749.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//tv/news/hindi/iqbal-khan-why-should-schools-charge-fees-for-the-facilities-students-are-not-using/articleshow/76913738.cms

State agriculture commissioner Suhas Divase will be the new metropolitan commissioner of PMRDA, replacing Kumar.Saurabh Rao, who was the sugar commissioner, will be taking charge of the Pune divisional commissioner’s office as officer on special duty (OSD). Rao is likely to replace Deepak Mhaisekar, the current divisional commissioner who is going to retire by the end of July. This is the fourth consecutive tenure of Rao in Pune.The transfer of Gaikwad is reportedly an outcome of alleged failure in controlling the outbreak of, despite freedom given to him by the state government.

By Sudeshna Duttaand Hassan emerge asfor their logistical advantage, access to clean water and availability of landWhile microbreweries are all the rage in Bengaluru, theof India, breweries of your favourite bottled beers have found their home away from the city. Mysuru and Hassan inare fast becoming the go-to destinations which are looking attractive to brewery owners.Thomas Hartman, VP – Innovation & Brewing, Bira 91, says, “Mysuru has given us a strategic advantage in terms of brewery location, and we are able to cater to a large part of our volume through this. Not only that, the brewery also houses our first-ever innovation lab for flavourful new beers.” He says their ingredients are locally sourced from India and some are imported from Europe and the USA.“Additionally, the water at all our breweries is filtered and run through reverse osmosis, effectively rendering it pure H2O before use. From there, our brewers add select minerals in our beers to ensure consistency in taste across all four breweries in Mysuru, Kovvur in Andhra Pradesh, Nagpur in Maharashtra and Indore in Madhya Pradesh,” says Hartman. They have installed a pilot system, which allows brewers to brew beers in smaller batches, play around with new ideas, and also send those beers to Bira Taproom in Bengaluru and receive direct consumer feedback.Javed Murad, founder, White Owl, which manufactures its products at a partner-owned brewery in Hassan, says some of the immediate perks of this plant include shorter supply chain lead time, lower logistics costs and in certain cases, savings on various state-to-state import and export duties, all of which enable brands to provide more competitive end-pricing to consumers. ""We are currently brewing our two most popular beer styles in Hassan -- Spark, a refreshing Belgian Wit, and Spike, our smooth Weizenbock, which is a strong craft beer. However, we expect to add more of our brands to the mix once our kegging line is activated at the plant over the next few months. At that point, supply will expand not just within Karnataka but also to the rest of the country, especially to markets in Goa, Telangana and Maharashtra,"" adds Murad.AB InBev’s SPR brewery situated in the town of T Narasipura, which is about 45 minutes away from Mysuru, brews some of the world’s most: Budweiser, Budweiser Magnum, Beck’s Ice and Beck’s Ice Premium Lager, specialty wheat beers Veere and Machaa from 7Rivers Brewing Co. as well as regional favourites like Knock Out, Royal Challenge and Foster’s, to name a few.“Brewing beer requires access to clean and affordable water supply to meet production demands, and the city is well-placed with its access to quality water resources. Owing to its Infrastructural facilities and availability of 60 acres of land, Mysuru was our best bet,” says Gagandeep Sethi, VP Supply & Logistics – South Asia, AB InBev. The brewery in Mysuru is also the first among their breweries in India to adopt renewable electricity to power its operations.“This initiative is part of our global commitment to secure 100 per cent of the company’s electricity from renewable sources by 2025. We signed a long-term Power Purchase Agreement in 2018 to make the shift to green electricity. Within just two years, SPR has achieved over 65 per cent renewable electricity adoption, successfully reducing its carbon footprint by over 3.5 million kg,” says Sethi.Apart from global exports, SPR also transports its products to Pondicherry and Kerala. From a manufacturing point of view, the brewery has been built in such a way that can cater to the larger hubs of Mysuru, Bengaluru and other parts of Karnataka.",bengaluru,"https://static.toiimg.com/photo/imgsize-294304,msid-76916190/76916190.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/karnataka-is-high-on-old-mysore-region/articleshow/76917227.cms

Among these, Giloy and Ashwagandha tops the list. In fact, we have run out of stock of Ashwagandha saplings as the demand is so high. Ever since concoction or kadha of these herbs is being promoted from various platforms to keep the virus at bay, people are planting them in their homes.”Airing a similar view is JP Sharma , a senior staff at Chandra Shekhar Azad Park (Company Bagh), Prayagraj, “We sell at least 100 saplings of Ashwagandha plants everyday.

22,['12/07/2020'],"Packed stadiums, crowds, intimacy: Will VFX solve shooting dilemmas?","Over the last decade, VFX (visual effects) has played an increasingly prominent role in Bollywood films. And, in the current normal that we are all living in, we will probably see filmmakers leaning more towards VFX to bring the desired impact in their movies. In keeping with safety norms, filmmakers are chalking out ways to involve fewer people on the sets of a film, thus opening more doors for VFX teams to play a bigger role in the narrative, especially when it comes to sequences involving outdoor locations, elaborate dance numbers, action scenes and large crowds. In a recent chat with BT, filmmaker R Balki said, “I think VFX technology will play a huge role in our cinema now. It’s going to explode in this country like it never has before. So, I think newer ways of designing things in our films… in fact, technology is going to play a huge part in filmmaking right now.“This period will throw up a lot of innovative ideas for filmmaking using VFX. In fact, it will make visible changes in the way TV, gaming and advertising industries function. With precise planning, VFX can be a tool for filmmakers to make the shooting process more convenient. Crowd scenes were always a part of VFX, and now, we can try to create intimate scenes using technology. But I doubt if a full-scale CGI (Computer-Generated Imagery) will be worth the effort in most cases, as it adds to the expense,” said Naveen Paul (co-founder and VFX supervisor at NY vfxwaala), who has worked on the special effects for movies like 'Tanhaji: The Unsung Warrior'.Keitan Yadav (COO, Redchillies VFX) believes that the future of cinema lies in virtual production. He cited examples of films like 'The Lion King' and 'The Mandalorian' series, which were shot using virtual production technology. It was also employed for parts of the Shah Rukh Khan-starrer, 'Zero'. He shared, “Filmmakers can use this technology at the pre-production stage, for planning and organising the shoot schedule. This will reduce the number of days required for shoots, save cost and ensure smooth execution of shoots. It will reduce VFX work and improve quality within the pre-decided budget.” Harry Hingorani (VFX supervisor and creative officer of the company) added, “VFX companies are the ones, who will be able to help filmmakers adapt to these changes. We recently got a call from a producer, saying that he was half way through the film before the lockdown. They have 50-plus days of shoot pending, including a big sequence that requires them to go out of Mumbai. Since they can’t do that, we are getting into virtual production with them.”Producer Nikkhil Advani , whose films 'Bell Bottom' and 'Satyameva Jayate 2' will go on floors in the weeks to come, said, “It’s extremely short-sighted to see VFX as a solution for shoots post lockdown. You will still have to send a unit to the location to take plates. Also, if it needs to be done correctly, it means matching light conditions, camera angles and depth of field. In India, we have constantly used VFX as a tool for correction, while it actually needs to be used for creation. If VFX has to be an option to shoot at interesting locations and scenes with crowds, it will become imperative to give more time to prep for each of those sequences.”Filmmaker Rahul Dholakia, who will be helming Taapsee Pannu ’s 'Shabaash Mithu', the biopic on cricketer Mithali Raj , shared, “VFX will become very important for me, because, without it, how do I show jam-packed stadiums? Also, we may not be able to go to various locations because of revised budgets and other constraints; so, VFX will have to help us. And as far as the narrative is concerned, I don’t think VFX is the only player; rewriting screenplays to adhere to shooting guidelines will play an important role.”Producer Boney Kapoor agreed, “VFX was already playing a vital role, and now, its importance will increase further. In our film 'Maidaan', we have to create a certain ‘period’ as well as different football stadiums. So, VFX will play a substantial role. I do see it becoming a stronger part of the narrative if it helps save cost and enhances quality. But I know that live action and VFX cannot replace each other beyond a certain level. So, we will use VFX as much as possible, especially in times of COVID-19, because the safety of cast and crew is most important.”Voicing an important concern, he added, “In terms of investment and recovery, I believe that VFX studios will also have to rethink their pricing. If they want to get the bulk of the work, they will have to deliver on pricing as well as quality, as we are all interdependent. There are many countries that offer rebates and incentives for post-production, and that’s something that can be a huge opportunity for Indian post-production industry as well.”",entertainment,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-76916172,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-180057/76916172.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/hindi/bollywood/news/packed-stadiums-crowds-intimacy-will-vfx-solve-shooting-dilemmas/articleshow/76916172.cms

In other words, while global Covid-19 cases are rising sharply, India’s growth rate is higher than the international average.On Saturday, fresh Covid-19 cases across the country surged to 28,998, just two short of the 29,000 mark, as per data collated from state governments.

NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Saturday saw a rush of PILs seeking court-monitored investigations into the encounter killing of gangster Vikas Dubey on Friday.

The first off the block was advocate Anoop Prakash Awasthi, who termed the encounter a ‘cold-blooded killing’ and referred to UP Police as an “organised gang of criminals” by quoting a half-century-old observation of Justice A N Mulla. He said Dubey’s killing appeared to be motivated to “eliminate a crucial witness to the criminal-police-politician nexus in UP”.

“An exemplary action coupled with big reforms is needed to infuse public confidence in the cardinal principle ‘might is not right’ and to assure them they are not living in a medieval draconian authoritative state but in a state governed by rule of law,” he said.

Awasthi sought CBI/NIA/court-monitored probe into the separate encounter killings of Dubey, his five associates as well as the 60 cases pending against him and his gang, which he said could throw light on the unholy criminal-police-politician nexus.

Meanwhile, NGO People’s Union for Civil Liberties has filed an application seeking an SIT probe into encounter killings of Dubey and aides Amar Dubey and Prabhat Mishra. It sought the application to be made part of its earlier PIL, which had sought probe into encounter killings in 2017-18 and a probe by a committee headed by a sitting SC-judge into the criminal-police-politician nexus.

The NGO said, “Encounter/administrative liquidation is a serious crime — murder/culpable homicide, is an offence against the entire society. If such a crime is committed with the support of the state..., it takes a very serious dimension, questioning the entire rule of law and governance in accordance with the Constitution.”

I’ve had

for many years, but couldn’t identify it somehow. I come from a well-to-do family, but shifted to a middle class environment after marriage. I was pressured to settle down within a month, learn customs and language of the new state. I was expecting support since it was a love marriage; instead, I realised that I was brought here to be a maid. I felt as if I was locked in my own house struggling to breathe. It was worse after my first delivery due to postpartum depression. I have lived these years with cheating by my partner, helplessness and loneliness. The lockdowns have only worsened the situation. I need to hug my children and get that spark back in my relationship with my husband but I hate them all. Help.

I am 49 and have been on medication for 31 years. My mother died when I was just 7. I am the only child and my father put pressure on me to study hard in school and college, and later forced me into marriage against my wishes. I don’t have a good relationship with my wife of 20 years. I love both my kids dearly, but my son, 15, gets annoyed with me often. I don’t want to be with my abusive wife anymore. I tell my father that he is responsible for my personal trauma. What should I do?

I am a 1st-year MSc student. My brother has had a mental health condition for four years. He breaks things at home when angry and leaves home when we scold him. Due to the lockdown, it has been difficult to get medical help for him. He has also stopped taking his medicines, saying that they make him feel sleepy and lethargic. I asked my parents to take him to a counsellor but our relatives scolded me for advising elders and have instead taken my brother to tantriks. Please help.

I am a final-year physics student waiting for exams. For the last few days, I haven’t been feeling well emotionally. I have very few friends. I thought of sharing my feelings with them but it may needlessly trouble them. After my father passed away, it has been very difficult for me to stay calm and focused. I pretend to smile but deep down I want to scream my lungs out. On most days I feel really low. I have very few friends. Sometimes I feel I will never achieve anything in my life. I get scared seeing my mother’s unhappy face. I miss my papa. I am not able to talk about my feelings and anxiety to anyone. Please help me.

My son is 9. He is an intelligent boy with high interest in outdoor sports, but due to this pandemic and being confined to home, he is losing interest in studies, wants to play games on mobile phone all day or watch TV. He told me that he is getting frustrated and doesn't feel like doing anywhere or having any other hobby other than mobile games TV. How should I tackle this situation?

Write to us at talkitout@timesgroup.com with your question, name and place. But if you wish to stay anonymous, do indicate that in your email.

I understand that you have been in a difficult situation for the past few years, and coping with depression and relationship issues. I really admire your courage for keeping a positive outlook in life despite such challenges. It will help if you can slowly try to bring about small changes within you, one day at a time. For example, start penning down your thoughts in a diary. Start by stating what you want and slowly create boundaries that will help you have your own space Speak to a therapist or a marriage counsellor. You could also reach out to your local women and child helpline or cell for emotional guidance.Sometimes parents forget that their children are born through them and not to them. I see that your father has made decisions in your life, sometimes even against your will. You made choices based on your circumstances. Have you talked to your wife? Think about relationship counselling and individual counselling. The past is over, and though your father made some decisions for you, your present and future are in your hands.Life can be very challenging for the family and caregivers of mental health patients. I understand that there is stigma attached to mental health and you are concerned about your brother. But you can’t help anyone at the cost of your own mental well-being. So, first take care of your own self. We live in a culture where people believe in unscientific practices. Respect their beliefs but put across your point of seeking professional help. You can start with approaching an online counsellor.I understand your grief. Waiting for exams and not having many friends to talk to can be challenging. I would recommend that you reflect on your life’s learnings and take time to heal. Speak to a friend, and if that’s not possible, speak to a professional counsellor as there are multiple emotions that need to be addressed. You can start working on what you want in your life professionally and personally. Think about past success and focus on your strengths. Pen down your thoughts in a diary.These are unprecedented times and extremely challenging for a lot of people. I can understand your worry about your son. I see that he was an active child before and as things have changed now he might be also finding it difficult to set himself in the new routine and a different lifestyle.I would recommend that you sit with your child and create a schedule. You can share your feelings about the routine challenges with him and ask him what he is feeling. Creating boundaries with a time-bound structure will help you both adjust to the new routine. You can enroll him for an online class like dance, karate, self-defense, etc. You can also do activities which involve physical movement like working out. The process of adjusting in the new lifestyle will take time, therefore I suggest you to be patient and regularly communicate with your child.",home,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-76914791,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-295978,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//home/sunday-times/you-cant-help-anyone-at-the-cost-of-your-own-mental-health-take-care-of-yourself-first/articleshow/76914592.cms
39,['12/07/2020'],"It is the coronavirus that is killing the economy, not just the lockdown, says Prof Bhramar Mukherjee","The global fight against

has been as much about data as drugs and vaccines. In March, Bhramar Mukherjee, professor and Chair of Biostatistics at the University of Michigan School of Public Health, set up an interdisciplinary study team of 15 researchers from academic institutions in the US and India to work on Covid-19 modelling and predictions. The team updates their projections daily using their app covind19.org. Mukherjee, who grew up in Kolkata where her family still lives, tells Neelam Raaj how this was a way for quarantined data scientists to do their bit for their homeland

India recently overtook Russia to record the world’s third largest caseload but some experts point out that per capita caseload is low as well as the case fatality rate. What do you think of this assessment?

What do you think of the quality of Covid-19 data released by India?

When it comes to lockdowns, it’s been economists versus the public health experts. What is your stand?

Some models have predicted a peak in August with the worst getting over by October. What’s your take?

Data scientists have been playing an important role in this fight against coronavirus. What made you focus on India?

There has been a lot of discussion on how countries with women leaders have dealt better with the pandemic. Do you agree?

Success stories like Dharavi have hit the headlines. What are the lessons that other parts of the country can draw from India’s largest slum?

What is your reaction to the US homeland security service’s policy on F-1 students leaving the country because of the universities going online to offer public health protection to faculty, staff and students?

You’ve tweeted that you’ve been reading poetry in the pandemic. Can you quote some of your favourite lines that have kept you going?

The numbers are not a surprise as we had predicted that India will cross the million mark by mid-July back in May. I think the concept of per capita case-load being low as a metric of success is fundamentally flawed. We need to think about the number of “active cases” and expected hospitalisations in a metro/region and assess whether the healthcare capacity is able to handle serious cases. The case fatality rate does appear to be low for India (hovering around 3%), perhaps largely due to the younger population. However, if you calculate this rate based on the closed cases for whom you know the outcome definitively, this is higher (4.2%). I worry whether all deaths are being reported and whether the cause of death is being assigned appropriately.India is a very data-poor country when it comes to human health. We need granular level daily data on hospitalisation rates, death rates not just due to Covid-19, but related to severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) and influenza like illness (ILI) and overall. We need to be able to compare with historic trends to see the departure from those trends. We need demographics and mobility data at a finer geographical resolution. We need real-time sophisticated analyses that are automated. It is a pity since India has such wealth in statistics and information technology.This is a long and painful crisis. We are on a Schrodinger’s seesaw where, as policymakers, you change positions nimbly to maintain this balance between economic and public health costs and benefits. I do believe national lockdown was not sustainable beyond June, and now it is time to closely monitor the data and escalate prevention strategies, testing and alert health care systems. This is a nasty virus, we cannot let our guards down and simply surrender to destiny. The public needs to learn how to manage and minimise their own risks. You have to remember that even if lockdowns are not in place, the economy suffers like in Sweden which suffered economic shrinkage and reduction despite not imposing a lockdown. It is the virus that is killing the economy, not just the lockdown. We need to deal with the virus effectively and the economy will swing back up.I am sceptical about long-term projections from these forecasting models including our own as the ground reality changes rapidly. Look at Delhi. The reproduction number is around 0.8 for the past few days which shows excellent progress and that humans can beat dire projections. The concept of a national peak is nebulous and there will be a wave of peaks cascading through the nation over the next couple of months. Our current projections indicate 1.2-1.4 million cases by July 30 and high alert in eastern ( Bihar West Bengal ) and southern States ( Karnataka , Telangana, Andhra Pradesh).I started this project with the altruistic goal of bringing together Indian doctoral and post-doctoral students who are studying in the US, and in particular in my own department. I wanted to repurpose their anxiety and confinement into something meaningful. It is our service as quarantined data scientists to our motherland where most of our loved ones are.I have written a paper on this with my students. As the first woman chair of one of the world’s oldest, finest and largest Biostatistics departments, I was naturally intrigued by what the data said. We found that women leaders are ahead in all public health metrics but the difference is not quite statistically significant. I think it is not just women, but countries that are progressive enough to choose diverse leaders are doing better in fighting this disease. Perhaps this is something to think about as we choose our future leaders!This is not rocket science, we can do it, even in a low-resource setting where the odds are stacked against us. This gives us hope. We need centralised isolation and quarantine to prevent household and cluster transmission. Self-isolation and quarantine is not a solution in populous countries with large households and congested neighborhoods. We need grassroots level community health workers monitoring symptoms/temperature when large-scale testing is not possible. We need to protect health care workers with adequate PPE so they are not afraid to do the work. We need to lead with efficiency, empathy and elasticity, scale up things that are working, shut down policies that are failing.Several universities, including University of Michigan have joined forces and filed a lawsuit to seek temporary restraining order on this policy and bar ICE from enforcing the order. I am outraged by this policy which is against the fundamental values of the US education system. Senseless acts like this can harm US universities for a long time. Moreover, people are being forced to teach in person sacrificing public health safety. It is against science and law. My heart goes out to all F-1 students for the chaos, stress, anxiety and uncertainty they are facing right now. I hope this attempted promulgation by a cruel and reckless administration goes nowhere. If everybody who has ever held an F-1 visa in the US stops going to work for seven days, the system will collapse. I came to the US on an F-1 visa in 1996 and I am proud of my journey as an immigrant scholar in American academia.I have been thinking about the times when humanity underwent similar major global crisis like plague, world wars, famine and how artists expressed themselves during these bleak times. Three poets have really helped me through this quarantine time, WB Yeats, Emily Dickinson and Rainer Maria Rilke. “Second Coming” by Yeats and “Hope” by Dickinson has become my daily mantra. However I would like to share these four lines by Rilke (the poem is titled: Go to the limits of your longing) which when translated from German reads:Let everything happen to youBeauty and terrorJust keep goingNo Feeling is FinalThis is so true that when we are going through pain we know there is a rescue waiting and when we are at the pinnacle of happiness we know tears are going to come. Such is the tapestry of life.

The focus has intensified after the tension with China on the Ladakh border as the government is keen to bolster domestic manufacturing.Sources said the FDI reforms could be announced over the next few weeks.

42,['12/07/2020'],Railways set to get regulator as it readies for private operators,"Railway board chairman V K Yadav (File photo)

NEW DELHI: The Indian Railways will get a regulator as it starts the process of allowing private operators to run passenger train services, Railway board chairman V K Yadav told TOI in an interview.

While this long awaited reform will help attract more private investment, the national transporter has decided not to outsource the Railway Protection Force (RPF) and its hospitals.

Responding to a question on the need for a regulator, Railway Board chairman, Yadav said though earlier there was a proposal to set up Rail Development Authority (RDA), now they are reviewing its terms of reference. “We want to review that proposal in the current situation because when it was formulated there was no discussion about private sector participation in passenger train operation. Certainly we will have to go for some sort of RDA,” Yadav said.

In 2017, the department of personnel and training (DoPT) had finalised the process of selecting a regulator, but it couldn’t happen.

Now the role of regulator becomes all the more important to decide on pricing of services to protect consumer interests and to create positive environment for investment and benchmarking of service standards.

Yadav said the decision to allow private operators to run trains has been taken “not in isolation”; railways targets shifting of nearly 90% of freight trains from its Delhi-Mumbai and Delhi-Kolkata network to the dedicated freight corridors by end of 2023. He added the potential speed of the entire 11,000 km high density route on GQ and golden diagonal would be 130 kmph by March 2021 and then it will be increased to 160 kmph.

When asked about the recommendation of high-power group, which prepared National Infrastructure Pipeline report, for railways to get rid of non-remunerative and non-core activities such as running police force (RPF), schools and hospitals, the Railway Board chief said that they have been working on these for quite some time. “We have considered all other non-core activities except for hospitals and RPF. There are special reasons for continuing with RFP and hospitals. We have over 12 lakh employees and we have a lot of mandatory medical check-up for our operation staff such as drivers and guards. Getting these check-ups done by private or state government hospitals is not feasible,” he said.

On the issue of RPF, Yadav said the security has to be provided by RPF or GRP and the system has been working well with good coordination between these two agencies. “So, we will continue with this arrangement for the time being,” he said.

Yadav also said they have drastically reduced the number of schools run by the railways. “We have a very few schools only in those areas where there is no proper state government schools. Wherever states are willing, we are handing over our schools to them. We would offload schools,” Yadav said.

NEW DELHI: In continued progress on disengagement in Ladakh, Chinese military further reduced its presence in the Finger 4 area of Pangong Tso . Having vacated the base of spur earlier, People’s Liberation Army personnel have thinned down presence on ridge-line as well.

Agency reports said some boats from Pangong Lake in eastern Ladakh had also been removed but this could not be confirmed.

The reduction on the ridge-line comes ahead of another round of talks between senior military commanders from India and China to finalise modalities for “Phase II” of disengagement along the Line of Actual Control. The areas under discussion will include Pangong Lake and Depsang where Chinese troops have intruded into the area between Finger 4-8 where Indian patrols have been a regular presence.

India-China LAC face off: Follow live updates

The Chinese troops were previously an irregular presence until their recent intrusions.

The Chinese are maintaining that the works, such as a road in Depsang, are on territory under their control.

The escalation in tension in eastern Ladakh was triggered by a clash between the two armies in Pangong Tso on May 5 in which a sizeable number of personnel from both sides were injured. A few days later there was a similar physical clash in Naku La in Sikkim though on a smaller scale. The military face-off continued and led to skirmish at Galwan Valley patrol point 14 on night of June 15.

At the military talks, the two sides are expected to specifically focus on completing withdrawal of troops from Pangong Tso and Depsang besides laying out a detailed roadmap for disengagement of large numbers of troops from the rear bases in a time-bound manner. Both sides had significantly ramped up troops and weaponry in eastern Ladakh.

The de-escalation following disengagement is expected to see de-mobilising of troops. Indian commanders are keeping a very close vigil to see that PLA adheres to what its political leadership has promised.

44,['12/07/2020'],"Economy going back to normal, uncertainties remain: RBI governor","RBI governor Shaktikanta Das (File photo)

MUMBAI: RBI governor Shaktikanta Das on Saturday said that the economy is showing signs of normalising in response to the staggered easing of restrictions and argued that the policy measures announced by RBI to counter the impact of Covid-19 appear to have worked so far.

Despite the easing, the governor said that it was uncertain when supply chains would be restored fully; how long it would take for demand conditions to normalise; and what kind of durable effects the pandemic would leave behind on potential growth.

In his address at the SBI Banking & Economics Conclave, Das urged private and public sector lenders to raise more capital, stating that recapitalisation of banks is “absolutely necessary” as bad loans could rise because of compression in growth.

Highlighting the policy measures taken by RBI, Das said that central bank has released additional liquidity to the tune of Rs 9.57 lakh crore (equivalent to about 4.7% of nominal GDP) since February 2020. But these countercyclical measures were not going to be permanent.

“Post containment of Covid-19, a very careful trajectory has to be followed in orderly unwinding of counter-cyclical regulatory measures and the financial sector should return to normal functioning without relying on the regulatory relaxations as the new norm,” said Das.

The governor said that banks were in a better shape in March this year compared to the previous year. However, this was not enough as once in hundred-year risk events were now taking place more than once a decade, he said.

46,['12/07/2020'],A major feat for SSB’s small action team,"PATNA: For small action team (SAT) of Sashastra Seema Bal ( SSB ), the commandos of which neutralised four armed Maoists after heavy exchange of fire deep inside the jungles of Valmiki Tiger Reserve at Bagaha in West Champaran district on Friday, it was the biggest successful operation in Bihar and Jharkhand since its formation in 2018.

While the major task of SSB is to guard porous and sensitive Indo-Nepal international border, three of its battalions under Patna frontier have been deployed in anti-Maoist operations in the state and two more at Dumka and Ranchi in Jharkhand.

SAT commandos remain equipped with bullet-proof vests, head-gears, ultramodern communication equipment, navigational devices and sophisticated weaponry for conducting anti-Maoist operations.

SSB Patna frontier IG Sanjay Kumar, who conceptualised SAT in 2018, said SSB’s success rate in anti-Maoist operations was low in Bihar and Jharkhand due to which SATs were formed so that Maoists having expertise in guerrilla warfare could be countered by the same technique.

“Only those below 35 years of age with high motivation level are handpicked to undergo grey-hound training at Hyderabad and Counter-Insurgency and Jungle Warfare (CIJW) training at Gwaldam in Uttarakhand for three months each to become SAT commando,” he said.

“They are not included in general duty and kept aloof from public to hide identity. They keep conducing dry practices, refreshing courses and do case studies round the year. Several facilities are given to SAT commandos,” Kumar said.

The IG said a SAT comprises 23-24 commandos. “They move swiftly in jungles without exposing themselves just like Maoists. A SAT commando can survive in dense forests on his own resources for five to seven days,” he added.

“On July 18, 2018, SAT had neutralised two Maoists. Later, one more Maoist was neutralised in January last year in Dumka. Last year, SAT had eliminated one armed Maoist in Muzaffarpur,” Kumar said.

The IG said each battalion in anti-Maoist operation has two SATs with maximum 30 members each. “In future, the SAT strength will be increased. Every SSB company in five battalions involved in anti-Maoist operations in Bihar and Jharkhand will have one SAT each,” he said.

47,['12/07/2020'],Flood scare as rivers cross danger mark in north Bihar,"Monsoon clouds hover over Patna on Saturday

PATNA/BAGAHA: Water level in several rivers in north Bihar crossed the danger mark on Saturday following heavy to very heavy rainfall in Terai region of Nepal and districts along the foothills of the Himalayas in Bihar over the last two to three days.

The water resources department (WRD), however, said the situation was not alarming as discharge from barrages on many rivers flowing from Nepal to Bihar decreased on Saturday. The WRD also said all embankments of rivers flowing in the state were safe.

As per the daily flood bulletin issued by WRD on Saturday, Bagmati was flowing above danger level at six places in Sitamarhi district. Kamla Balan was flowing above danger level at two places in Madhubani district. Bhutahi Balan, on the other hand, was also flowing above the danger level in Madhubani district.

Lalbakeya river too was flowing above danger level in East Champaran district. Kosi was flowing above danger level at five places in different districts in north Bihar. Similarly, Adhwara, Mahananda and Ghaghra rivers were also flowing above danger level in Sitamarhi, Kishanganj and Siwan districts, respectively.

The volume of water flowing through the barrage across Kosi at Barahkshetra in Nepal plunged from 2.10 lakh cusecs on Friday afternoon to 1.78 lakh cusecs by Saturday afternoon. Down south at the Birpur barrage across Kosi in Supaul district, the water discharge increased from 2.35 lakh cusecs to 2.74 lakh cusecs by Saturday morning, but dropped to 2.41 lakh cusecs by the afternoon. The water discharge was showing falling trend at both barrages.

On the other hand, the water discharge through Valmiki Nagar barrage across Gandak increased from 1.89 lakh cusecs on Friday afternoon to 2.73 lakh cusecs on Saturday morning, but again plunged to 2.51 lakh cusecs by the afternoon.

The high level of water discharge from Valmikinagar barrage caused displacement of small population in the low-lying areas. Assistant engineer at Gandak barrage, Vikas Kumar, said the floodwaters entered SSB outpost camp at Jhanduwa tola of 21 battalion at Bagaha and Chakadahawa village under Valmikinagar police station. People from several villages under Piparasi, Madhubani, Thakaraha and Bhitaha blocks took shelter on ‘machans’ or uplands.

West Champaran DM Kundan Kumar has sounded an alert in 18 blocks of the district situated on the banks of hilly rivers like Masan, Shikarahan, Pandai and Gandak.

Meanwhile, Patna Meteorological Centre maintained a yellow alert for thunderstorm with lightning over the next two days. India Meteorological Centre stated in its all- India bulletin that monsoon trough line was passing along the foothill of Himalayas, a situation which causes heavy rainfall along India-Nepal border. Accordingly, the IMD has predicted isolated extremely heavy rainfall over Bihar on Sunday.

WRD minister Sanjay Kumar Jha said a close vigil was maintained as far as water level in the rivers flowing from Nepal to Bihar is concerned. “Water discharge from Birpur and Valmikinagar barrage decreased on Saturday, but we are keeping a close watch on the situation,” Jha said.

48,['12/07/2020'],Border districts put on alert after killing of four Maoists,"PATNA: The killing of four Maoists in an encounter by security forces in West Champaran’s Valmiki Tiger Reserve (VTR) on Friday has once again brought the focus on left-wing extremists still active in some districts bordering Nepal.

Apprehending a backlash from the CPI-Maoists over the killing of their active members and seizure of sophisticated weapons, the state police headquarters on Friday directed all SPs in north Bihar districts to keep a close watch on red rebels operating under their jurisdiction.

Besides West Champaran and East Champaran, districts such as Sitamarhi, Sheohar, Muzaffarpur and Vaishali have been put on high alert. “We are cautious and keeping surveillance on movement of the members of the banned outfit,” Sitamarhi SP Anil Kumar said.

Mahindwara and Belsand in Sitamarhi, which is close to the India-Nepal border, are considered to be hotbeds of Maoist activities. Similarly, areas falling under Tariyani, Shyampur Bhatahan and Purnahia police stations in Sheohar districts are affected. Madhuban and Dhaka in East Champaran district had earlier witnessed Naxal-related incidents.

Acting Vaishali SP Pushkar Anand said that villages under Hajipur Sadar, Patepur, Jandaha and Tisiauta police stations in the districts had earlier witnessed Naxal-related incidents, which showed their influence on local residents. “The SHOs of the police stations concerned have been asked to verify how many of them were out on bail,” he told TOI over the phone on Saturday.

Sources in the state police headquarters said those killed in the VRT forest in West Champaran were part of the Maoists’ group, which had envisaged a detailed strategy to impart training to newly recruited cadres. However, it is yet to be verified whether Maoists from Nepal were also present at the congregation.

Top ranking leaders from Darbhanga, Sheohar, Sitamarhi, East Champaran and West Champaran in Bihar besides some from Jharkhand had assembled in VTR forests. Ram Babu Ram alias Rajan, who belonged to the East Champaran-Sheohar region, however, managed to escape unhurt in the gunbattle.

A source in the state intelligence wing said, “The Maoists have focused on strengthening their base in north Bihar districts, especially those sharing their borders with Nepal in the wake of stepped up police operations against ultras in south and central Bihar.”

49,['12/07/2020'],Giriraj Singh raises population control law bogey once again,"Union minister and Begusarai MP Giriraj Singh

PATNA: Union minister and Begusarai MP Giriraj Singh has called for a strict population control law in India, which should be applicable for everyone in the country, irrespective of religion.

“New population control norms are needed if the country wants to stand on a par with developed countries,” Giriraj said on the occasion of World Population Day on Saturday. The BJP MP has raised similar demands in the past as well.

Amid the tensions with China over the Galwan valley clash in Ladakh, Giriraj cited the example of the neighbouring country’s effective population control norms. “If China didn’t introduce population control laws in 1969 it would have had another 60 crore population now. The fundamental reason behind the present day development of China is its population control norms. Similar, strict laws are required to put a curb on the rising population in India,” he said in a statement posted on his official Twitter handle.

Elaborating on the issues arising out of “uncontrolled population”, Giriraj stated, “Population can be an asset and it can also be a liability. In the case of India, it has become imperative to control the population explosion. Our population is a little above 15% of the global population. The land left with us is mere 2% of the global land availability. Water resources with India are also only 4% and the water level is plunging every year.”

The firebrand Hindutva leader appealed that population control should not be made into a political issue nor should it be linked with religion. “This issue should only be raised for the development of the country. Our resources are limited and we are facing population explosion. We need a strict law if we want to move ahead on the trajectory of development.”

Giriraj’s statement, however, invited sharp criticism from opposition RJD. “He is a Union minister and should be thinking about the Covid-19 pandemic in which India is at the highest position. But he is talking about controversial issues like population control. The ruling party should talk about more important issues like availability of food, employment and other basic amenities in the country,” RJD spokesperson Mrityunjay Tiwari said.

Apart from new candidates, there are some aspirants who are trying their luck for the second or third time.Like Arif, the anxiety levels of many aspirants who are appearing for the NEET and JEE Main as well as Advanced are increasing every day due to uncertainty and repeated postponements. “I have studied enough, and carry out revision every day.

In north India many aspirants take a year’s break after their plus-two, exclusively to prepare for entrance tests, but in Karnataka students prepare parallelly along with regular PU classes.

However, off the cuff, Surtis appear nonchalant about the precautionary measures prescribed by the government and city administration.

In the last fortnight, the civic body has collected fine to the tune of Rs 1 crore from citizens found flouting rules about wearing masks, spitting in public places and not maintaining social distancing.

The textile shops located on Ring Road, Sahara Darwaja and Salabatpura; retail shops and establishments, vegetable vendors, saloons, medical shops, diamond markets etc have been covered under the stringent checking drive in all the eight municipal zones of the city.

Out of the total Rs 1 crore fine collected, about 40% comes from flouters of the mask rule. About 20,000 people including commuters and pedestrians had to cough up Rs 40 lakh for moving outside without wearing masks.

On an average about Rs 1.5 lakh fine per day has been collected from the textile shops for flouting social distancing, not wearing masks and not keeping sanitizer etc.

A lumpsum amount of Rs 5,000 fine is collected from the textile shops found flouting the norms.

Central zone, Varachha (A), Varachha (B) and Katargam, which are Covid-19 hotspots, have topped the chart for flouting of norms. About 60% of the penalties have been collected from these four zones in the last fortnight.

On Saturday, fine to the tune of Rs 10 lakh was collected from all the eight municipal zones, out of which Rs 6 lakh was collected from Central, Varachha (A), Varachha (B) and Katargam zones.

Kamlesh Naik, assistant municipal commissioner (enforcement wing) said, “Since last fortnight, intensive checking has started, especially in the hotspots, to penalise those not wearing masks and flouting social distancing norms.”

Naik added, “Our teams in various municipal zones are facing ire from the shop owners when they fine them for not wearing masks and social distancing. At many places, our staff is collecting fines with the support of the city police.”

Deputy municipal commissioner, Dr Ashish Naik said, “Despite the sharp increase in Covid-19 cases, people are not bothered to wear masks and follow social distancing. Penalising them is the only way to inculcate the habit of wearing masks.”

The deceased were identified as Harsh Kosambia (21), a nursing student and Gaurav Sailor (19), studying in the Industrial Training Institute (ITI), both residents of Mandir Mohalla in Ichhapore village.

The duo had gone for a swim in the pond on Saturday morning.

Sources in the fire and emergency department of Surat Municipal Corporation (SMC) stated that the incident occurred at about 10 am. After the youths went there for a swim, villagers could see no movement in the waters. It took about three hours for the rescuers to fish out the bodies of the deceased.

A fire officer said, “The deceased may have waded into deep waters and could not move due to the sticky mud inside the pond. Some villagers, who rushed to the pond after hearing their cries for help, informed the fire department.”

The fire officials rushed the youths to the New Civil Hospital (NCH) where doctors declared them dead on arrival.

PATNA: Police arrested notorious criminal and contract killer Bijendra Sharma alias Chotu Singh (25) along with one of his associates, Mantu Kumar (22), from Akhtiyarpur bridge under the Paliganj police station area in western Patna on Saturday.

A military-grade hand grenade, two country-made pistols and five live cartridges were recovered from the possession of the arrested criminals. Police said Bijendra was involved in several contract killings in Paliganj, Arwal and Jehanabad.

While Bijendra is a native of Mera village under the Khidi Mor police station area in Paliganj, Mantu hails from Jhiktiya village under the Kinjar police station area in Arwal district. Bijendra is also nephew of Anil Sharma, who was once commander of now non-existing Ranbir Sena.

Paliganj SHO Sunil Kumar said acting on a tip-off, police intercepted the two criminals on the bridge and arrested them. “The seized grenade is generally used by the Indian Army,” the SHO said, adding Bijendra’s criminal history dates back to 2010. “He was evading arrest in connection with at least five murder cases lodged with Paliganj and Khidi Mor police stations in Patna,” he said.

62,['12/07/2020'],Laptop may unravel Reds’ ‘safe haven’ plan,"BETTIAH: Apart from the cache of arms, ammunition and detonators the joint team of the Bagaha police special task force (STF) and the SSB’s small action team (SAT) recovered along with the bodies of four Maoists after a 50-minute encounter in the Valmiki Tiger Reserve (VTR) jungles on Friday, the cops also seized a laptop and some Maoist literature from the encounter site.

“The seizure of the laptop is important. This should provide us with vital information on their plans and present organisational links,” Champaran range DIG Lallan Mohan Prasad told this newspaper on Saturday.

Friday’s successful encounter, the DIG said, was an outcome of close coordination and input sharing between officers of the STF led by ASP (operations) Dharmendra Jha and the SSB’s inspector Rituraj, an officer of the Muzaffarpur-based 32nd battalion that monitors extremist activities in north Bihar. Rituraj, who was injured in the exchange of fire, is out of danger.

Late on Thursday evening, when Jha, a CRPF officer from the Hazaribagh-based 203 Cobra unit on lien to the Bihar Police exchanged notes with the SSB officer, their inputs matched and the location of the Maoists were confirmed. At 10pm that night, their joint team moved towards the jungles. The heavy downpour made movement slow but the cops managed to reach the jungles around Chautha naala after midnight. With the first rays of light, movement was detected and the team opened fire around 4.45am. “The operation lasted for 50 minutes and when firing from the other side stopped, our men moved in cautiously,” the DIG said.

Jha, the ASP (ops), instantly recognised the body of Vipul whom he had arrested in 2018 for the murder of Manoj Singh, mukhiya of Champapur-Gonouli. A native of Pavitranagar in Sheohar, Vipul had first moved to these jungles in 2017 to re-establish base and recruit fresh cadre. He had befriended and recruited Nisha Majhi, a young Musahar girl. The two were soon married. Nisha too was arrested in the mukhiya murder case. “After she secured bail, she soon grew disillusioned and left the organisation,” a local officer said.

In the 1990s, the Maoists had entrenched themselves in the VTR jungles under the leadership of Narendra Nath, a maverick originally hailing from Surajkund, Haryana. Apparently a ‘bhakt’ of Godman Rajneesh, he had assumed and was known by the name of ‘Osho’. A BIT-Mesra grad, Osho moved to JNU and undertook doctoral research on the peasant struggle in Hazaribagh. He then moved to the VTR jungles and opened a school at Sundarpur within this area. His arrest in August 2001 blew his cover of being an educationist and social worker. He was an ideologue and had recruited local Tharus and Oraons.

For the last 15 years, VTR has been peaceful and government development work, especially education, is visible. The return of the Reds, therefore, raises concerns. While a number of young women too were recruited then, the fresh attempt is believed to be in nascent stage. In 2018, Chanda Mahto, a 19-year-old Tharu girl was recruited. But she too was soon disappointed and returned home.

Among the four Maoists killed in Friday’s encounter was 22-year-old Chotu Mahto, a Tharu youth who the Reds had recruited just three months ago. Friday’s encounter thus is a body blow to fresh Maoist designs, but recruitment patterns preceding this along with their plans to resurrect Champaran’s VTR jungles as their safe haven may now be unlocked with the examination of the seized laptop’s contents.

63,['12/07/2020'],Centre OKs bridge parallel to Vikramshila Setu,"PATNA: State road constriction minister Nand Kishor Yadav on Saturday said infrastructure finance committee of the ministry of road, transport and highways (MoRTH) has given its nod to construction of a four-lane bridge parallel to Vikramshila Setu over the Ganga in Bhagalpur.

The bridge is proposed to be constructed with an expenditure of Rs 1,116.72 crore over the period of four years. The 4.367-km-long bridge, to be constructed east of Vikramshila Setu, will have 68 pillars.

The minister said of the total 21.3 hectares of land required for the bridge, 2.2 hecates have been acquired so far. “The state government will acquire the remaining 19.1 hectares of land using its own funds. A sum of Rs 51 crore has already been allotted to the Bhagalpur district administration for the purpose,” he said.

The bridge along with 10.6-km-long approach road was included in the Prime Minister’s special package for Bihar in December 2018. Later, approval for the proposed alignment for the new bridge was given by a high-level committee of MoRTH in September last year.

“Bidding process for roping in firm for construction of the bridge is expected to commence within a month,” Nand Kishor said.

He said the bridge would be a part of new national highway (NH) from Naugachia to Bhagalpur and further up to neighbouring Jharkhand. “The road from Naugachia to Bhagalpur has recently been notified as NH-131 (B) by the Centre. The road from Bhagalpur to Hansdiha has also been notified as NH. The two roads will act as approach roads for the upcoming bridge,” the minister said.

He added the construction of the new bridge would improve vehicular movement between Seemanchal area in north Bihar and Jharkhand as well as West Bengal.

“Sufficient space will be left underneath the bridge to allow movement of ships as per requirements of Indian Waterways Authority of India,” he said.

The need for construction of the bridge parallel to Vikramshila Setu was felt after damages were detected in the existing bridge, which was inaugurated in 2001.

Surat: Seven persons were booked by Umra police on Friday for allegedly selling high demand scarce medicine for treatment of critical Covid-19 patients in black.

The accused were arranging the injections to be brought from Ahmedabad on forged papers and selling it at inflated prices of Rs 57,000 for one vial against the actual MRP of Rs 40,545.

A complaint was lodged in this regard by Mahesh Italiya, drug inspector, in FDCA, Surat, after the Food and Drug Control Administration (FDCA) laid a trap and started investigation.

Police booked two residents of Surat, owner of Sarthak Pharma, Uma Saket Kejriwal and Mitul Shah, owner of New Shanti Medicines. The others are Amit Manchharamani, Ghanshyam Vyas, Abhishek, Bhavesh Solanki of Dhruvi Distributors, four from Ahmedabad and a resident of Mumbai, Bhavesh.

The accused were booked under various sections of Indian Penal Code including 406 (criminal breach of trust), conspiracy and others. They were also booked under Drugs and Cosmetics Act and Essential Commodities Act as well.

On June 19, FDCA had laid a trap at Sarthak Pharma on Vesu-Abhva Road following specific information. “FDCA had received specific information about black marketing of the medicine Tocilizumab by Sarthak Pharma. We sent a dummy buyer and after few days they arranged the injection. We seized total three injections from them which they were selling at Rs 57,000 for each,” said R M Patel, assistant commissioner, FDCA, Surat.

Investigation by FDCA revealed that Kejriwal bought the injection from Shah who bought it from Manchharamani. Working for the syndicate Vyas had arranged positive report of Covid patient and prescription as well. “FDCA’s Ahmedabad office is investigating the case now since it is a huge racket,” Patel added.

“Police registered the offence based on the investigation done by FDCA. Police will now arrest the accused. The accused were not found when police went to arrest them,” said M L Salunke, police inspector, Umra police station.

Looking at the performance of the school over the last 160 years, it has been allowed to expand its base by Bishop Paritosh Canning , the head of the Kolkata Diocese of the CNI. The new school will be administered by the governing body of the Howrah school.

The Chinsurah campus will be inaugurated on July 14 by the bishop. The new building has come up just beside Duff School, which is again a heritage campus run by the CNI. To start with, the school will admit children up to Class IV this year and move gradually up. The school will seek affiliation from the CISCE and plans are to go up to Class XII.

Nearly 300 kids have already sought admission in the school. There was a long-time demand for an English-medium missionary school in the area and hence this decision to start the school, said sources in the CNI. “Duff School is also run by us and has a brilliant track record, but it is a Bengali-medium school. So to meet the demand of the people, the bishop has allowed St Thomas’ Church School, Howrah, to start its second campus in Chinsurah,” the source said.

The FIR alleged that her husband, Chirag Pandya, a resident of Gayatri Park in Odhav, had demanded and a cash dowry of Rs 4 lakh from them to buy a flat. Police found a suicide note in which Amruta has written about the harassment she was subjected to.

The complainant, an MBA student, stated that Amruta married Pandya in 2013. He is presently a contracted data entry operator with the district panchayat.

According to the FIR, at the time of the wedding, Pandya worked for the health department in Dholka and would commute there from Ahmedabad on a daily basis. “He and Amruta lived in Dholka for a while and then returned to Ahmedabad. They then shifted to Vastral, where Pandya had bought a house,” said a police official.

The complainant alleged that for about a year and a half, Pandya never took her sister out and even barred her from participating in social functions at the house, because of her caste.

The FIR says Pandya would not even let Amruta speak to them (her family) and would speak ill of her ‘character’ time and again. “The FIR alleges Pandya has also driven his wife out of the house to coerce her to bring Rs 4 lakh from her parents to buy a house, which they eventually gave him,” added a police official.

The FIR says that in February Pandya drove Amruta out of the house again. “She came to live with us in Vadodara and then went to our maternal uncle Sanjeev Vasava’s house in Narmada district. Pandya later went there and took Amruta back to his new house in Vastral,” a police source said.

Inspector K S Dave said they lodged an offence under Sections 323, 306, 498(a) of the IPC and under the SC/ST Prevention of Atrocities Act and transferred the investigation to the SC/ST cell.

The FIR states that a relative of Amruta’s had gone to Pandya’s house in Vastral to talk about a divorce. The door was locked from the inside and when they opened it, Amruta’s body was lying on a bed. “They called an ambulance to take her to hospital but paramedics declared her dead. We also found a suicide note, saying she was committing suicide due to harassment by her husband,” said a police official.

The complainant said that they were late in registering the FIR because they busy with her last rites.

VADODARA: India’s celebrated ceramic artist Jyotsna Bhatt passed away at her residence in Vadodara on Saturday afternoon. She was 80 and had suffered a sudden spike in blood pressure resulting in a brain stroke, her family members told TOI.

The octogenarian artist, who, like her husband – Padma Shri awardee artist Jyoti Bhatt – had remained both a student and teacher at M S University’s famed Faculty of Fine Arts.

“She was doing well but suffered from a brain haemorrhage. Doctors informed that there was excessive bleeding in the brain which had affected all vital parts of her brain,” her nephew Arjun Mehta told TOI.

On Saturday morning, she was brought home from a private hospital where she was being treated with ventilator support . Meanwhile, her Mumbai-based daughter Jaii had also reached Vadodara.

“Incidentally, only a few days back, during a family conversation, Bhatt had clearly stated that if something happens to her, she should not be kept under any ventilator or tubes, stating that it would be the ‘worst thing that would happen to her’,” recalled Mehta, adding that even the doctors had opined that under ventilator she would remain in a vegetative state with a major part of her brain not functioning.

She remained unconscious throughout till she breathed her last at her own home. “It was peaceful amongst family members,” he said.

The last rites were performed at Vadi Wadi crematorium later in the day in presence of few members of the family.

Hailed as queen of studio pottery , Jyotsna Bhatt had moved from Mumbai to Baroda in 1958 to learn sculpture under legendary teachers like late professor Sankho Chaudhuri.

She married Jyoti Bhatt, a student of the first batch of fine arts and accompanied him to New York where she got trained in ceramics at the Brooklyn Museum Art School after which she started practising sculptural pottery.

In her own words, she discovered her interest in making three-dimensional figures in Vadodara where she taught and later even headed the ceramics department till her retirement nearly two decades back.

Her ceramic works included images of cats and dogs, distinctive clay toys and art works prepared from alkaline earths, amorphous moulds and matte finish glazes that earned her admirers.

The late artist had mentored and encouraged several young ceramicists during her career spanning over 50 years during which she remained part of several group exhibitions, workshops, art camps and solo shows.

Munger University also postponed its Degree Part I and Part II examinations scheduled from March 24 and 25, respectively. The fresh examination dates will be decided only on the basis of the instructions from the chancellor’s secretariat.

Aryabhatta Knowledge University also postponed some exams, but later decided to promote all the students of the 2019-2020 session, except for those in the final semester. “Students of BTech, BPharm, vocational, MBA, MCA, MTech and MEd programmes will be promoted without examinations,” pro-vice-chancellor (VC) S M Karim told this newspaper.

Some time back, the Raj Bhavan had constituted a seven-member committee of VCs to take a decision on the conduct of university examinations. “It is likely to submit a report to the chancellor next week. Only then the universities will receive any instruction from the Raj Bhavan,” said sources.

In its latest guidelines, the University Grants Commission (UGC) had directed the universities to complete all the final semester examinations by the end of September.

“As things stand today, it does not seem feasible for the universities to complete their exams as per the UGC’s deadline,” said a senior academic of PU.

Our teachers and lab technicians are, therefore, making sure that everything is explained properly through live streaming.

He rued, “I had been preparing for civil services exams ever since I turned 14.

Hence the number of beds had to be reduced in comparison to our total strength,” said a doctor posted at one of the dedicated Covid-19 hospitals.Even before making AIIMS-Patna the fourth dedicated Covid-19 facility in Bihar, 400 beds were reserved for coronavirus patients and with 1,597 beds at three dedicated hospitals, the total number of beds for serious patients stood at 1,997 in Bihar.AIIMS-Patna has a total capacity of 960 beds and the hospital administration on Saturday said they will now be using all of them for treating Covid-19 patients. When asked about the ICMR guidelines to maintain distance between beds of patients, AIIMS-Patna superintendent Dr CM Singh said, “We are working on that.”With additional 100 beds in six other MCHs and the beds in all four dedicated hospitals, the number of beds for treating serious Covid-19 patients has gone up to 3,057.As of Saturday afternoon, there were 374 Covid-19 patients admitted in the four dedicated hospitals of whom 84 are in ICU and 20 are on ventilator support.Several patients are also admitted at the other MCHs. The health department on Friday had even tagged districts with all MCHs and now people from particular district will be sent to MCH with which it is tagged.When asked about the preparations in this regard, Darbhanga Medical College and Hospital principal Dr Harsh Narayan Jha said, “We are in a better position as we have two newly constructed buildings in our campus which we will be using to treat Covid-19 patients. We have already identified 100 beds.”There is a three-tier system for Covid-19 positive patients in Bihar. Serious ones are admitted at the dedicated hospitals. The second rung is that of District Covid Care Centres (DCCC) made out of hotels, guest houses and government buildings lying vacant and coronavirus positive people who mainly need isolation and not much medical treatment are kept here. Doctors and paramedics visit to take the stock of situation.The third tier is the Dedicated Covid Health Centre (DCHCs) which have been earmarked in the sub-divisional and district hospitals as well as newly constructed buildings in hospital campuses.

ISC student Somay Gupta of St Xavier’s Institution, Panihati , scored 86% despite being in a wheelchair due to a spinal cord injury he sustained in 2018. The lower part of his body was paralyzed after he dived into a pool and hit the stairs.

Gupta was forced to take a break from school and was sent to NIIMHANS in Bengaluru. “He spent four months in Bengaluru, after which his condition improved,” said his mother Seema. The 17-year-old is planning to study commerce and wants to become a chartered accountant. Though he has to devote three-and-a-half hours in the morning and evening to physiotherapy every day, he is a confident student. Since he wheelchair-bound, he could not sit for long hours initially. But gradually, in the last two years, he has been able to stretch it to four hours, which allowed him to take the ISC exams.

St Augustine’s Day School, Kolkata, student Fiza Tabassum is another braveheart who scored 91% in ISC. A humanities student, Tabassum suffered an attack of Guillain-Barre Syndrome and Cervico Melycius when she was in Class IX. “I was left paralysed and was admitted to Belle Vue Clinic . I was in the ICU for 15 days,” said the Elliot Road resident who had scored 86% in ICSE. Her knees and feet are not strong enough and she still has neurological issues. “But I was determined not to miss a year,” Tabassum said.

Heritage School student Harsh Gupta lost his father on the day he took his ISC accountancy papers. He rushed to the exam hall from the crematorium. “My father always wanted me to pursue my dreams of being a chartered accountant. Now that he is no more, I have a bigger responsibility to make that dream come true,” he said. With an 85.2% score, he now wants to enrol in a Kolkata college and follow his dream.

Although Covid-19 cases are rising unabated in the state capital, people can be seen roaming unnecessarily on the streets. The movement of autos, buses, trains as well as flights continues and vegetable and fruit markets remain crowded, especially in the evenings.According to Patna district magistrate (DM) Kumar Ravi’s order issued on Wednesday, shops selling essential commodities such as groceries, fruits, vegetables, dairy products and meat will remain open amid the curbs till July 16. Those, who violate the lockdown norms, will face legal action.“The officials concerned have been asked to ensure that everyone wears masks and follows social distancing norms,” Kumar Ravi said.Divisional commissioner Sanjay Kumar Agarwal has also directed the officials to ensure strict deployment of police officers to make the lockdown effective. “They have been told to speed up contact tracing and inform people about the containment zones,” he said.Sources claimed that altogether 430 people were fined for not following traffic rules and other precautionary measures in the state on Saturday. A sum of Rs 14.5 lakh was collected as penalty from them.Many city residents pointed out that people were hardly following the lockdown norms. Nahar Khagaul Road resident Manish Kumar (name changed), who had gone to buy fruits and vegetables from the Jagdeopath market on Saturday morning, said, “Hundreds of people thronged the market where most vendors were without masks. The situation is pathetic because such people are the reason behind the sudden rise in the number of corona cases in Patna.”Kadamkuan resident Uma Shankar Prasad also witnessed a huge crowd on Daldali Road. “Since the shops were shut in the afternoon, a large number of people went out to buy groceries in the evening.

78,['12/07/2020'],Situation not conducive for elections in Bihar: Congress MLC,"PATNA: After RJD and LJP, Congress and poll strategist Prashant Kishor on Saturday favoured postponement of assembly polls in the state in view of Covid-19 pandemic.

Congress MLC Prem Chand Mishra said the Commission should convene an all-party meeting to reach a consensus on holding elections in the state in October-November amid Covid-19 pandemic.

Kishor, on the other hand, took a swipe at CM Nitish Kumar, saying it was time to fight Covid-19 pandemic, not elections. “The coronavirus situation in Bihar is worsening. But a big part of government machinery and resources are busy making preparations for the assembly elections,” he tweeted.

Congress MLC Mishra said conduct of elections would pose a threat to the safety of voters, polling personnel and security forces.

Describing the situation as “unfavourable” for holding elections, Mishra said the number of Covid-19 positive cases was increasing day by day and if the trend continues, it will be difficult for political parties to face polls. “However, Congress is keeping a watch on the situation and, at the same time, it has started initial preparations for the polls,” he added.

Mishra hoped that the Election Commission would ensure poll-related arrangements in such a manner that there will be least chances of people getting infected with deadly virus.

Earlier in the day, Kishor took to twitter to slam Nitish for favouring assembly elections amid Covid-19 outbreak. Kishor, once considered a confidante of JD(U) national president Nitish Kumar, was expelled from the party in January this year after their relations got strained.

Kishor’s reactions came a day after Chirag Paswan, national president of LJP, expressed concern over the rising number of Covid positive cases and said that it was not the right time to conduct elections in the state.

Prior to Chirag, RJD leader and former deputy CM Tejashwi Prasad Yadav had advocated for deferment of elections. “The situation is not conducive to hold elections in the state,” Tejashwi had said.

“Except BJP and JD(U), all major political parties have described the situation as not conducive for holding the elections. Under such circumstances, the task of the Election Commission has become difficult,” said a political analyst.

The human trial of indigenous vaccine for Covid-19 will also commence at AIIMS- P from Monday.Begusarai-based orthopaedic surgeon Dr Brajesh Kumar voluntarily donated his plasma on July 1. Kumar, who was declared Covid-19 negative on June 7, said being a doctor it’s his responsibility to work for the welfare of the common people. “Plasma donation is just like normal blood donation. In fact, the quantity of blood taken out during this process is much less. All corona-recovered people should come forward to donate their plasma as it can save precious lives,” he said.Dr Kumar added the therapy is based on the concept of passive immunity, where antibodies of diseases developed in a person are used for treating others.Dr Neha Singh, blood transfusion officer at the department of transfusion medicine and blood bank at AIIMS- Patna , said several people, of late, have come forward to donate plasma for the therapy. “At least 15 Covid-recovered people from Patna, Muzaffarpur and other places in the state voluntarily came forward to donate their plasma. Of them, three were not fit,” she said, adding a recovered patient can donate plasma after every 15 days.Khajpura resident Deepak Kumar, who donated his blood for the second time on Friday, also happens to be the first plasma donor. “Despite my family stopping me from donating plasma, I donated it again because I know how one feels after contracting the virus. However, for a change, I didn’t feel weak this time,” he said.Meanwhile, the human trial of Covid-19 vaccine — Covaxin — which has been jointly developed by the National Institute of Virology-Pune and Hyderabad-based Bharat Biotech International Limited (BBIL) in collaboration with the ICMR, will begin at AIIMS-P from Monday.AIIMS-P superintendent Dr CM Singh said screening of people would commence from Monday. “A slew of tests, including urine test and blood test, will be done.

MYSURU: Following four deaths in Narasimharaja (NR) assembly constituency, the district administration has decided to clamp a lockdown for a week, in a bid to contain the spread of the novel coronavirus.Deaths have been reported from Kalyangiri, Udayagiri and Subhashnagar. Door-to-door visits and clamping a lockdown in these areas is inevitable, on the lines of Mumbai’s Dharavi module, officials say.Deputy commissioner Abhiram G Sankar said that they have the support of community leaders and people’s representatives in this regard, as they suspect that this could be a cluster case. “Only officials alone can’t handle the situation. We are now involving community leaders and local residents as well,” he said.“We held a meeting with community leaders and people’s representatives on Friday. We are not getting enough support for the door-to-door survey now. Many are not sharing details,” the DC said.“Deaths are taking place as soon as patients are rushed for treatment. Patients are being brought when they are in a critical stage. Our aim is to bring down the mortality rate,” the DC stated.“Our idea is intensifying the door-to-door survey and to identify the vulnerable in the population. Early medical support to the needy is our aim. We are planning to follow the Dharavi model ,” Abhiram stated. “Sealing areas, carrying out intensive surveys and segregating vulnerable groups was done in Dharavi. The same will be followed here,” he said.“A covid care centre is also planned in the locality, with the participation of locals and volunteers. A burial ground will be identified on government land outside the city limits,” he added.District minister S T Somashekar expressed concern over the increase in number of Covid cases in NR constituency . “Residents are not cooperating with health and district authorities to carry out testing and door-to-door surveys. Therefore, we are planning to seal a few localities in the constituency. A final decision will be taken after holding discussions with local leaders,” the minister said.A covid care centre with 600 beds has been established at the KSOU building in Mandakalli.

Talking to TOI, the district magistrate Kaushal Raj Sharma said, “As no plasma unit could be arranged at the blood bank of BHU hospital and it was urgently needed for a private medico, we spoke to KGMU officials in Lucknow after which one unit of plasma was arranged and transported to Varanasi on Saturday afternoon.” With its arrival, the first plasma therapy will be conducted in Varanasi after the announcement of its formal beginning at BHU hospital on July 9. BHU hospital is designated for providing level-3 facility for critical Covid positive cases, while it also houses the only laboratory for sample testing in east UP region.When asked about the reason behind the delay in beginning the plasma therapy even as the cases are on a constant rise, the DM said, “The BHU hospital authorities informed us that their initial application for clinical research of plasma therapy had been turned down by ICMR.

82,['12/07/2020'],Covid-19 norm: Saturday is the new Sunday,"Customers throng the fish market near the Marina beach on Saturday to buy fresh catch

CHENNAI: For years now, Saturday was the slowest day of the week in terms of sales for Malini Palayam , a fishmonger who peddles her stock in the Saidapet area. But that was until the state government declared that Sundays were going to be days of “intense lockdowns” where trade of any kind would not be allowed. Now, says Malini, she works extra time on Saturdays just to keep up with the demand of her regulars stocking up for the week. “I used to sit on the pavement from 6am to 9am on Saturdays, but now I don’t leave before 1.20 pm,” she says. “I bring double my usual stock of fish on Saturday because people get angry if I run out.”

Sunday was usually the day when families would bustle about to complete their grocery shopping, meat and fruit buying for week, but the no-excuses lockdown declared on that day have resulted in Saturdays becoming the new Sunday. Fish mongers, meat delivery websites, fruit and vegetable stores all claim that Saturday has become their busiest day of the week in terms of sales.

On Saturday alone, for instance, the Tamil Nadu Fisheries Development Corporation website and app Meengal, recorded the highest amount of sales since mid-April. Official sources said that there was a 150% hike in orders compared to other days. The highest selling items were the seer slices, nethili and catla, crab. Over half a tonne kilograms of more than 15 varieties of fishes were sold on Saturday. Local meat vendors say the Saturday demand is quite literally becoming the ‘new normal’. Abdullah, a local meat vendor in the Saidapet area, says in the first week of the lockdown he was unprepared for the Saturday demand, and lost out on sales to his competitors. “But now I have caught on. I’ve stocked up for the bulk orders that come in. My customers usually cook mutton and chicken on Sundays and so would line up outside my store early in the morning. Now, they just stock up on Saturday.”

Like Abdullah, Kalaivani L, who sells vegetables on a cart, too learned the hard way about the Saturday demand. ""I didn't take the first week of the intense lockdown seriously. I brought the usual amount of vegetables to sell. Within minutes of me pulling into my usual corner, I was surrounded by men and women grabbing whatever was in the cart. Most bought more than usual and I was sold out in 30 minutes. Now I bring four times my usual stock because it is a big sales day.""

Triplicane resident TE Srivatsan says he went to a popular vegetable shop on RK Mutt Road on Saturday and because of the crowds, guidelines pertaining to how many people should be inside the supermarket were not followed. ""In supermarkets, shelf space is maximised so the aisle space is very less. The place was crowded and people were walking rather close to each other. Those at the billing counters had also removed their masks. They complained about wearing masks constantly,"" he says.

Sinha had embarked on a nine-day tour of several districts in Bihar, including Gaya, Aurangabad, Jehanabad and Sasaram on Tuesday under his ‘Badlo Bihar, Banao Behtar Bihar” campaign with a view to dislodge the NDA government led by CM Nitish Kumar. He issued a statement on Saturday saying he would now interact with people through the digital medium in the wake of the lockdown enforced in various districts.

“The government seems to be scared of my public interactions, and probably because of the same reason, lockdown has been enforced in different districts. It is a political move to stop the opposition. Otherwise lockdown was not being enforced all these days, when Covid cases were surging but it has been enforced now when we are interacting with people,” Sinha tweeted.

Training guns at the state government on the issue of handling of the Covid-19 pandemic, Sinha said in another tweet: “The number of Covid infected persons is rising steeply across the state. The situation is deteriorating with every passing day but the rate of Covid-19 testing continues to remain very low. It is a matter of concern that Covid testing in Bihar is perhaps the lowest as compared to the rest of the country.”

Sinha, a former BJP stalwart, was slated to conclude his nine-day tour on July 16 after visiting different districts, including Bhabhua, Buxar, Chapra, Siwan, Gopalganj, Bettiah, and Motihari among others. Other leaders who have joined his campaign as part of exploring a ‘third front’ in Bihar include former Union ministers Devendra Prasad Yadav, former MP Arun Kumar and Nagmani, former minister Narendra Singh.

JD (U) lashed out at Sinha, calling him an ‘outsider’ and ‘non- political’ entity. “First of all, when the second front in Bihar is on the verge of collapsing, then there is no question of a third front. Besides, we are answerable to people of Bihar not to him (Sinha), who is an outsider and a non-political entity,” JD (U) spokesperson Rajiv Ranjan Prasad said.

86,['12/07/2020'],Woman constable to face inquiry,"Surat: City police commissioner R B Brahmbhatt has ordered an inquiry into the controversy that involves a female lok rakshak police constable, Sunita Yadav , who is heard using abusive language in an audio recording.

Audio call recordings of Yadav talking with her senior officers have also gone viral. Police suspect that Yadav herself made the audio clips viral.

According to sources in the department, friends of Prakash Kanani, son of minister of state for health, Kishor alias Kumar Kanani, entered into argument on Thursday night. Yadav was posted on an internal road near Mini Bazaar in Varachha when the incident took place at around 10.30 pm.

“Friends of my son were out for treatment of a Covid positive patient when the policewomen stopped them. They called up my son for help. However, when my son reached there to help, the woman started abusing everybody including my son,” Kanani told TOI.

Kanani demanded that a fair inquiry should be done by the police and punish the guilty. He claimed that his son did not say anything insulting to the woman, but asserted that he too should be punished if he had done anything wrong.

“The audio recording that went viral is edited portion. She was abjectly abusive, hurling profanities at all those present there. As a police officer she has the right to enforce law, but cannot abuse and insult people,” Kanani added.

In the audio, the woman is heard hurling expletives. Meanwhile, Yadav went on sick leave and she has informed her senior officers in police head quarter that she has cold and viral infection.

Despite several attempts, the woman constable was not available for her comments. “The cop is on leave due to cold and viral infection,” said a police officer at head quarter. Yadav is posted in the head quarters and was assigned bandobust duty in Varachha.

“I have been ordered to inquire into the incident and behaviour of the woman. It is clear that she made the audio recordings viral in which she is using abusive language,” said C K Patel, assistant commissioner of police.

“I ordered thorough inquiry into the incident. Based on the detailed report actions will be taken against those found responsible for unlawful behaviour,” said city police commissioner R B Brahmbhatt.

Sources in police informed that the woman’s point of duty was changed thrice in past few days. B N Sagar, police inspector of Varachha police station, visited twice to point of duty of the woman in recent past after locals complained against her. Her senior officers have received photos of her forcing people to do sit-ups on road and also of abusing people.

87,['12/07/2020'],"Mukhtar Ansari aide’s house, property seized in Varanasi","VARANASI: In the statewide crackdown against gangsters, police continued to tighten the noose around jailed mafia don-turned-MLA Mukhtar Ansari. On Saturday, police confiscated property worth Rs 58.91 lakh belonging to Jhunna Pandit, a listed sharpshooter of Mukhtar, in Varanasi. In Ghazipur, arms licences of three of Mukhtar’s henchmen and relatives were suspended.

ADG Varanasi zone Brij Bhushan said, “A double-storey building, two plots and two motorcycles of Mukhtar’s sharp-shooter Shriprakash Mishra alias Jhunna Pandit of Ramduttpur under the limits of Cantonment police in Varanasi have been confiscated by a joint team of district administration and police.”

When the team led by ADM City Gulabchand and SP City Vikas Chandra Tripathi along with heavy police force raided the Ramduttpur residence of Jhunna, some women present there tried to protest. After they left, the officials completed the process of confiscation. The total value of the confiscated properties and cash recovered from Jhunna’s brother Om Prakash was Rs 59 lakhs, the officials told TOI.

Jhunna’s menace was last seen in Varanasi in 2019 when he had murdered a physically challenged youth in a property dispute. Later, he surrendered in Punjab’s Roopnagar on October 11, 2019. This 24-year-old sharp-shooter of Mukhtar gang had entered the crime world at the age of 15. As per police records, 10 cases of murder are lodged against him in Varanasi and neighbouring districts while many cases of murder, kidnapping and ransom have also been registered against him in Delhi.

Police had announced cash reward of Rs 1 lakh on him while he had also been booked under Gangster Act .

The ADG said that other action against Mukhtar’s henchmen and relatives was taken by the Ghazipur administration and police on Friday when on detection of irregularities in documents concerned the arms licences of Mohd Salim, Nuruddin (both relatives of Mukhtar) and a henchman Masood Alam were suspended. He said that all the arms were also deposited by the police.

For the past few months, especially after May end, the henchmen, relatives and shooters of Mukhtar are facing the heat as the cops are hitting their economic empire as well as their armoury. In this period not only their illegal possession from government lands were removed in Ghazipur, but their monopoly in fish trade of east UP region was also challenged.

A large number of henchmen were also booked under Gangster Act and sent behind bars in Mau, Ghazipur and other districts of the region.

91,['12/07/2020'],"In a first, centralised degree admissions in Goa","Representative image

PANAJI: Admissions to the first year degree programmes will begin via the directorate of higher education (DHE) portal from July 15. DHE officials have said that the entire admission process, including payment of fees, can be completed online and that students need not visit the colleges.

Besides BA, BCom, BSc, BCA, BBA, music, home science, BSc/B Ed, BA/B Ed degree programmes, admissions to law programmes will also take place through this portal.

For the first time, DHE is carrying out admissions to all non-professional degree programmes using a centralised system.

The Class XII result of the state board was announced around 15 days ago. Usually, admissions to first year general stream degree programmes begins immediately, but this year it could not due to the pandemic. DHE told students that the admission process for all colleges will take place under a common portal. In the meantime, colleges made their prospectus and course details available online.

“As per the MHA guidelines, the admission process is completely online without visiting off site campus,” the directorate stated.

DHE stated that it has developed a comprehensive online admission software for all non-professional colleges to process admission through a common portal.

“Students seeking admission in any of the colleges under the administrative control of DHE, should apply through https://www.dhe.goa.gov.in/ from July 15. The portal will provide detailed guidelines for the students about the online application process. Students can apply to a maximum of two colleges across Goa with the priority option,” the directorate has stated.

The portal will also facilitate merit list generation, counseling, final selection, and online payment. The students who are not shortlisted in first round of admission will get a chance to apply in second iteration, DHE has stated. It had earlier assured students that no one would be left without a seat.

Earlier, individual colleges carried out their admissions on their own. Some had already shifted the process online, but it was through the college’s own internet-based management system.

Under the common management system implemented by DHE, it will be able to get live updates centrally on the number of students enrolled and seats filled and vacant.

92,['12/07/2020'],NHAI sitting on revised Kamptee Road flyover design,"Nagpur: Even though Union transport minister Nitin Gadkari had asked the head office of National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) to approve the revised plan of Kamptee Road double decker flyover weeks ago, the file is still pending with the agency.

Residents of Mohan Nagar continue to have sleepless nights as the plan to start the flyover’s ramp opposite SFS Church is still on the table. They regularly enquire with MahaMetro officials only to learn that a final decision from NHAI is awaited.

MahaMetro had submitted a revised plan shifting the ramp towards LIC Square opposite VIMS Hospital but NHAI is yet to approve it. As on date, the ramp begins opposite the cathedral on paper.

Rajeev Agarwal, regional officer of NHAI, said that the matter was under consideration and the decision would be made public whenever its taken.

MahaMetro needs to acquire 0.7 acre land at a cost of Rs70 crore if the ramp starts opposite SFS Church. If the ramp begins opposite VIMS Hospital, 0.3 acre land is needed at a cost of Rs50 crore. However, the cost of construction will increase by Rs30 crore. So, the second proposal will cost only Rs10 crore than the first.

Mohan Nagar residents are against the ramp beginning from opposite the church as it would become an accident-prone spot putting lives of hundreds of school children and church-goers at risk. There are many schools near the church.

MahaMetro had made its plans public in January 2019. Immediately, residents of Mohan Nagar joined hands to oppose the flyover. They met Gadkari and corporators. In March 2019, Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) passed a resolution in the general body clearing the proposal to acquire 0.3 acre land at a cost of Rs50 crore near VIMS Hospital.

MahaMetro then prepared a revised design and submitted it to NHAI. The highway agency did nothing for months. MahaMetro could not carry on the work of Kamptee Road flyover as there was no approval from NHAI.

NHAI finally cleared the flyover in August 2019 but the location of the ramp remained unclear. Since then, MahaMetro has been working full swing on the flyover but not touching the ramp.

CHENNAI: Cash-strapped Greater Chennai Corporation had made an appeal to the property owners to pay the arrears of tax and the present due , last week. However, it is hounded by several issues as residents are unable to pay.

Despite the corporation’s claims of having updated all details, the column concerned in the portal keeps displaying a higher tax amount, complain residents. M V Krithivasan of Kodambakkam made a property tax payment in 2018-19 despite the confusion on revision. After the tax was rolled back, he was sure the portal would reflect the extra amount paid. However last week when he decided to check for his bill, he was shocked to see a higher rate of Rs 928, the same amount he had paid last year still showing due this year. Another resident, Indra Ganesh, who had paid Rs 1,814 as tax also said his tax amount had not been updated. “We have asked members of our association to not make any payment. We need to check the due amount and only if it is correct, payment will be made. The civic body should update the portal,” said V S Jayaraman, president of Motilal Street Residents’ Welfare Association in T Nagar.

Deputy commissioner (revenue) Meghanatha Reddy said the portal had been updated and those who paid extra would find the amount in negative. They need not make any payment. “There could be minor discrepancies which we will resolve in a couple of days,” he said, adding that in the past 10 days, Rs 2.21 crore was collected from 5,691 assessments.

Tamil Nadu had announced a revision of property tax for the period 2018-2019 based on the street rate and not the guideline value as was calculated earlier. They said the tax amount would not be more than 50%. However, residents, especially in added areas complained of higher taxes being collected with some having to pay a more than 100% increase, while those in the core city areas only had 10% increase. The revision was rolled back after a lot of complaints and the civic body had stopped collecting taxes. As per their figures, by March 2020 a collection of Rs 925 crore was made, including the revised amount.

There are 12.14 lakh assessments in the city, of which revision took place for 10.34 lakh properties. As per data available with TOI, more than 5 lakh properties had self-declared increase in their area.

Corporation commissioner G Prakash said they would resolve the issues. Meghanatha Reddy said, those who have grievances can call the assistant revenue officials, whose numbers are available on the corportaion website.

JAIPUR: A UK-India parliamentary group comprising members of parliament from both nations will be formed to foster ties, said Lok Sabha speaker Om Birla on Saturday.

The information was shared during a conversation with Padma Shri awardee British MP Bob Blackman, deputy high commissioner of the UK in India Peter Cook who was in conversation with Rajasthan BJP state president Satish Poonia . The programme was organised by the Rajasthan Association in UK over a video conference on Saturday.

“The lawmakers will be from all political parties. A collaboration between the parliamentarians will strengthen the relationship between the two traditional democracies. The inter-parliamentary discussions will bring out the best of best practices and will benefit governance,” said Birla.

“I will speak to the speaker of the British parliament to bring a delegation from the UK in the next parliament session,” said Birla, who thanked the UK government for carrying out a project on a farmers’ market in Bundi.

Blackman is an MP from Harrow East in London which is dominated by Indian diaspora. He is also the recipient of Padma Shri 2020.

“Unfortunately, due to the pandemic, I missed taking the award in a ceremony in person from president Ram Nath Kovind,” said Blackman, who was nominated for strengthening ties with India and public affairs works.

Responding to a question by Blackman on how to deal with parliament in the pandemic, Birla said that the structure of India’s parliament is such that virtual sessions cannot fit in the system.

“The committee meetings which consist of all party members have started and their nature is confidential so they can’t take place virtually. The necessary arrangements are being made to ensure that we hold physical parliamentary sessions and continue the legacy of discussions on every bill,” said Birla.

The British MP suggested following a hybrid system with a mix of virtual and physical sessions due to the pandemic.

Thiruvananthapuram: For regular visitors of cultural events in the city, the art and craft works of 83-year-old retired school teacher P S Padmini would be familiar. She has hosted four exhibitions in the city and always took pride in explaining the intricacies of her creations to visitors.

The lockdown has not hampered her will to express her talent through paintings and crafts. Unlike her past four exhibitions, the latest one is virtual and more than that, it is for a noble cause. Titled ‘Breaking Impossibilities: An Exhibition of Arts and Crafts for a Cause’, Padmini is conducting the exhibition to raise funds to construct a house for a 14-year-old girl from a financially poor family.

“I was interested in craft work from childhood and used to make handicraft items. After retirement, I started learning painting and have a series of art works,” Padmini said.

She has been receiving training in art from artist George Fernandez for the past 18 years. Padmini likes to experiment with various mediums in her works, such as mural, glass, oil, watercolour and epoxy. Her craft work includes ornamental candle making, embroidery, clay work, flower making, metal imposing, thread work, paper patch work, paper ribbon work, tie and dye and soft-toy making.

Around 200 art and craft works have been displayed in the virtual exhibition. The initiative was suggested by her son Prakash P Gopinath , the ‘bicycle mayor’ of Thiruvananthapuram who is engaged in social work. People may log in at http://induscyclingembassy.com to visit the virtual exhibition. The exhibition will conclude on August 4.

“I came to know about the girl through my friends. When my friends suggested conducting an exhibition to raise funds, she readily agreed. The Class IX girl is a resident of Vattiyoorkavu and lost her home in a fire. Her family comprises mother, a daily-wage labourer; elder brother, a Class XII student; and grandmother could not afford to construct a house. We will be collecting funds and will be constructing the house. Some people have come forward to help with the construction,” said Prakash.

A few private hospitals in the state capital have already announced such packages. With this, patients are expected to get treatment kits and virtual monitoring by nurses and doctors, based on the package the patient opts for. However, the launch may not be an easy task amid the rising challenges.

‘Adequate staff needed’

An official from a private hospital told TOI: “To introduce these packages, hospitals need to have adequate staff, as it requires a couple of video consultations per day, kits to be provided and if needed, a staff member may have to visit the house. A dedicated home visit team has to be constituted. Meanwhile, four medical colleges have shared responsibility of collecting swabs of Gulf returnees under institutional quarantine, which amounts to around 1,500 people.”

“There could be a slight delay in launching the package as several hospital staff have tested positive. Added to this, the Kerala government has imposed restrictions on daily commuters. Nearly 20% of the health care staff are from the neighbouring state. Labour OTs in a couple of hospitals have been sealed down forcing the other hospitals to share the burden. Doctors serving the Covid wards are working in shifts. Those exposed to Covid-19 patients are being quarantined for few days too.”

Most patients availing treatment under Ayushman scheme: Private hospitals

Private hospitals have observed that most Covid-19 patients are opting for treatment under the Ayushman scheme.

“A positive patient who is asymptomatic as per guidelines can be discharged and sent for home quarantine after notifying the district health department along with a consent obtained from a patient that he/she is aware and responsible on dos and don’ts for home quarantine as laid down by the government,” the officer added.

A source from a private hospital said around 10 % of beds in the Covid ward is occupied by its staff. Dr Prashanth Marla K, medical director, and transplant surgeon, A J Hospital & Research Centre said, “I don’t think there are as many admissions for Covid-19 in private hospitals and beds are also not that full. However, based on demand, we may consider teleconsultation and telemonitoring for asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic Covid patients.”

Vishal Hegde, pro-chancellor, Nitte Deemed to be University, said they will soon launch home isolation packages.

99,['12/07/2020'],SOG's FIR and arrest brings political rivalries to the fore,"Jaipur: A high-voltage political drama has unfolded in the state in the past 24 hours.

Hours after the BJP filed a privilege motion against chief minister Ashok Gehlot on Friday, the Special Operations Group of the state police registered an FIR and arrested two persons to probe charges about BJP’s attempts at toppling the Congress governement in the state.

A month ago, Congress chief whip Mahesh Joshi complained to the SOG that the BJP was indulging in horse trading to win the Rajya Sabha polls. The complaint was tossed to ACB and finally to the ATS but none of the three agencies registered an FIR in the matter.

The SOG suddenly registering an FIR on Friday and the two arrests on Saturday morning has raised a question mark on the timing of the political and police developments. It all started with Gehlot accusing senior BJP leaders of luring MLAs 10 days ahead of the Rajya Sabha polls on June 9.

Though the investigating agencies remained quiet for a month, the issue suddenly gained momentum after the SOG filed an FIR giving BJP the much-needed ammunition to take on the Congress.

Gehlot has put his weight behind the allegations by directly pointing at the senior BJP leaders through a presser. Replying to the accusations of the timing, Gehlot said, “SOG should be asked why they took so much time.”

The BJP doesn’t want to leave this question unanswered. Party state president Satish Poonia’s main argument is that the move was aimed at hiding the failures of the Covid situation in the state.

“The script of this entire episode was written in advance by Gehlot. First, levelling false allegations of horse-trading against us, then a complaint with the SOG and ACB, and then moving a privilege motion against me in the assembly. When we moved a similar privilege motion, the panicked Congress leaders drafted a letter on behalf of its MLAs against us. It has been found out that the Congress MLAs were not even aware of it,” said Poonia.

100,['12/07/2020'],Uttar Pradesh aims to snare China’s global sanitizer market,"LUCKNOW: Indian diplomats are still tactically engaging China for a thaw at the Line of Actual Control after the Union government banned 59 apps in a crushing financial blow, while the Yogi Adityanath government is aiming to dislodge the dragon as the top sanitizer provider in the global market “It might sound odd, but Uttar Pradesh is all set to dislodge China as the top sanitizer supplier to the US, European Union countries and other markets. The reason is China is selling sanitizer at rates that are four times more than ours,” said additional chief secretary excise and sugar, Sanjay A Bhoosreddy, while talking to TOI on Saturday.“Sanitizer produced in UP has captured market in almost all the states and now we are planning to tap the global market. Chief minister Yogi Adityanath has also given a go ahead for this,” he added,“On the intervention of our chief minister, the central government has lifted the ban on export of sanitizer and the state government is now facilitating the sanitizer producers to go global,” said Bhoosreddy, who had come up with the innovative idea of allowing distilleries and sugar mills to manufacture sanitizer at a time when the state was reeling under shortage with coronavirus disease enveloping the state in May and April.Bhoosreddy said, “An informal survey and trade inquiries revealed that China is selling a 200 ml bottle of sanitizer for around eight to 15 dollars in the US and other countries in Europe.”“Trade inquiries by our manufacturers received very enthusiastic response from western countries as our rates were considerably less, and so we are all set to capture the global market soon, where China holds a monopoly position. It’s the right time to dethrone China,” said Bhoosreddy.Before the corona crisis, the state was producing just 8,777 litre sanitizer per annum and only one factory in Modinagar was manufacturing it.As the corona crisis started engulfing the state, demand for sanitiser soared and the prices sky-rocketed. Since sanitiser was needed in the situation, the chief minister called Bhoosreddy and asked him to find a solution.“I involved distilleries and sugar mills which already had raw material in abundance. Soon there were 32 manufacturing units, and from 8,777 litres an year we started producing 60,000 litres a day within a fortnight. Some amendments in laws were done for decentralisation of powers to lower-rung officials for speedy approvals in this regard,” he said.“As the production grew exponentially so did the revenue. Earlier, while the state was earning Rs 8.36 lakh from sanitizer production, by June-end the excise has given Rs 100 crore revenue to the state amid lockdown,” Bhoosreddy added.“We are producing six lakh litres of sanitizer every day, out of which nearly two lakh litres is consumed in the state. We can think of exporting now as other states have also started manufacturing it.There is adequate availability of raw material as well as production capacity. And since the export ban has been lifted we are in a position to storm the global market,” said Bhoosreddy.As per the current production capacity, the manufacturing units in UP UP can sell 60 crore bottles of 200 ml with better quality than China’s and earn Rs 1,680 crore, translating to around $240 crore.",lucknow,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-76918243,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-99391,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/up-aims-to-snare-chinas-global-sanitizer-mkt/articleshow/76916458.cms
101,['12/07/2020'],"Goa government plans to rush ten bills, budget in one-day assembly session","The state government is set to go ahead with the budget even as the opposition has demanded that it be reset

PANAJI: The state government is planning to pass as many as ten bills , as well as the budget, during the one-day monsoon session of the Goa legislative assembly that’s slated for July 27.

A senior official said that the entire budget would be passed even though the opposition made it clear that it wouldn’t allow the Rs 21,056 crore budget to pass. Sources said that it is not known how the 10 bills and the budget would be passed unless the bills gets the assembly’s approval without proper discussion.

During the budget session, the government took a vote on account for five months, till August.

The opposition has been demanding the reset of the budget before it’s passed in view of covid situation . Leader of opposition Digambar Kamat had suggested that the government takes a vote on account on the budget as it is only a one day session. “The government has to reset the budget as it has no meaning,” he had said.

A senior official said that bills would be introduced by the departments of finance, panchayat, labour, the inspectorate of factories and boilers, etc. Besides these bills, appropriation bills too will be introduced.

He said that the state government has come out with various ordinances over the past four months, pertaining to matters such as revision of GST and the one-time settlement scheme for the commissioner of commercial tax on value added tax.

An ordinance was recently promulgated by the government with regards to a one-time settlement scheme covering all taxation acts for the assessment period up to March 31, 2016 in case of undisputed assessments, and up to June 30, 2017 in case of disputed assessments.

The official said that it’s necesary to convert ordinances into bills and pass them. “It is a constitutional requirement, or the ordinance will lapse,” he said. “As per procedure, any ordinance issued by the government has to be passed by the assembly within six months.”

One important legislation will be to bring three major amendments to the Goa Panchayati Raj Act— one will address the issue of waste management in village panchayats, another will allow MLAs and zilla panchayat members to participate at gram sabhas, and the third pertains to rationalisation of house and commercial tax in village panchayats.

103,['12/07/2020'],"For want of Rs15cr, police’s control centre for CCTVs lying idle","Nagpur: One of the salient components of the Smart City Project, the Command and Control Centre (CCC) was set up with an expenditure of around Rs51 crore for the police department to control crime and traffic related violations using CCTVs installed across the city. But the centre is lying idle for the last four months for want of just Rs15 crore.

Instead of readying the CCC, Smart City special purpose vehicle, Nagpur Smart and Sustainable City Development Corporation Limited (NSSCDCL) has earmarked Rs40 crore for garbage transfer stations, a project which was later revised to bio-mining of garbage though not a part of Smart City project. Public representatives and officials have locked horns over the issue.

The works on CCC were supposed to be completed in November 2017. After a visit to CCC being constructed on premises of Police Control Room in Civil Lines, it came to fore that even some interior civil works are yet to complete. All types of heavy machineries for storage, operation, cables, and video wall with 32 screens are yet to be installed.

CCC is part of the Rs520 crore Safe and Smart City Project which was the first component of Smart City Project. It was approved in 2016 by the then chief minister Devendra Fadnavis. L&T was awarded the project on October 18, 2016, with a deadline of one year followed by operation and maintenance (O&M) for five years.

Sources in NSSCDCL told TOI that Rs40 crore were spent on procuring machineries. A few software are in use at City Operation Centre (COC) developed at NMC Head Office and remaining lying idle for over a year.

“Project got delayed due to lack of funds for construction of CCC builiding. State-run Maha IT which planned the project had sanctioned an additional amount of Rs 10.42 crore for G+2 floor building and deadline was March 1, 2020. But Rs 15 crore more are needed for completing civil works and O&M for 5 years,” sources said.

The central government had sanctioned Rs7 crore for Smart Solid Waste Management Solutions under Smart City Project. NSSCDCL had spent around Rs2 crore for bins etc.

NSSCDCL earned interest of Rs35 crore on funds unutilized for long-time. Instead of giving this money for completion of CCC, the NSSCDCL proposed development of five garbage transfer stations at the cost of Rs40 crore in 2019. Municipal commissioner Tukaram Mundhe later diverted the funds for bio-mining of garbage.

It is one of major reasons behind union minister Nitin Gadkari and mayor Sandip Joshi up in arms against Mundhe. The tender is incomplete and supposed to be scrapped following technical issues.

Despite availability of funds, NSSCDCL is pursuing funds of Rs15 crore for completion of CCC with Maha IT.

Also, NSSCDCL as per suggestion of police department had proposed to develop artificial intelligence (AI) to detect traffic violations. But traffic cops have been detecting violations sitting before a video wall at COC for the last two years.

As per police department’s suggestions, NSSCDCL also proposed to install 3,000 more CCTVs and increase storage capacity from 15 days to 90 days.

NSSCDCL chairman Pravin Pardeshi said, “I had spoken to Maha IT secretary. We will resolve these issues and ensure all works are back on track within a month.”

106,['12/07/2020'],"Prove allegations or quit politics, BJP to Rajasthan CM","State BJP leaders Rajendra Rathore and Satish Poonia at a press meet

JAIPUR: Rajasthan BJP has accused chief minister Ashok Gehlot of scripting a political drama of horse trading against his government to hide own failures in handling the Covid situation in the state.

In a presser hours after Gehlot’s allegation of horse-trading against BJP leaders on Saturday noon, leader of the opposition Gulab Chand Kataria challenged the CM to either prove his charges or quit politics.

BJP state president Satish Poonia and deputy leader of opposition Rajendra Singh Rathore, who also attended the news conference, demanded an inquiry into ‘elephant trading’ by the Congress that merged six BSP MLAs into its fold.

“Who has stopped you from investigating (horse trading by BJP)? I want you to investigate all allegations you have levelled against us. We will not let you blame us for your failures and unresolved internal issues,” said Kataria.

Responding to Gehlot’s allegations of horse-trading against BJP, Kataria added, “We don’t have time for all such activities. You got the support of 124 MLAs in Rajya Sabha polls but if you can’t manage to hold them together, it means your house is not in order. Don’t blame us.”

On the FIR filed by the SOG, Poonia said the state government was misusing the investigating agencies to create fear among independent MLAs and the opposition.

“It would have been better had they used these agencies to eliminate corruption from the state. It would have been a great service to the citizens,” said Poonia.

Taking strong exception for dragging the name of PM Narendra Modi and home minister Amit Shah for scripting the toppling of state governments in Maharashtra and MP, Poonia said, “It is unfortunate that Gehlot has stooped to such levels for political gains. Using such a language for the PM and the home minister is a case of privilege motion.”

Deputy leader of opposition Rathore said investigation was in fact required over the merger of six BSP MLAs into Congress in violation of the rules. “Without the consent of the BSP central leadership or an agreement with the party state head, the merger is illegal,” said Rathore, who accused the Congress government of tapping the phones of BJP leaders.

109,['12/07/2020'],The two accused have no criminal history: SOG,"JAIPUR: The SOG on Saturday claimed it had found no criminal records of the two men arrested in connection with the ‘horse-trading’ issue. The duo was arrested based on intercepted phone conversation between them.

“We were investigating the mafia angle. It was suspected that Bharat Malani and Ashok Singh Chouhan might be involved in illegal dealings of arms and explosives. However, we found no evidence of that nature against them. Instead, we found that they were discussing attempts to topple the state government,” said Ashok Rathore, ADG (SOG and ATS).

“Both the accused have their own mines and are financially well to do,” claimed the officer.

Elaborating on the reason for arresting the duo based on phone conversation, Rathore said, “They have been arrested for criminal conspiracy and sedition. It was the nature of the conversation for which we filed the FIR and arrested them. Their phone conversation established that the two were talking about horse-trading of MLAs.”

On June 11, Congress chief whip Mahesh Joshi had complained to the SOG alleging that attempts were being made to topple the government. The SOG chief, however, said the two arrests had nothing to with Joshi’s complaint.

“The recent arrests were purely based on intercepted calls and not on Joshi’s complaint. That is a separate case and this investigation is not related to it,” he said.

Chouhan and Malani’s mobile phones were being tapped since June 13 but they have been arrested a month later. Explaining this, Rathore said, “There is a module which works to establish the nature of the calls, which is a time-consuming process.’

Rathore joined as ADG (SOG and ATS) on July 3 after taking over from Anil Paliwal. He was previously ADG of State Human Rights Commission and the recent arrests of the alleged conspirators comes exactly after a week of him taking over. He was earlier Jodhpur police commissioner, the home turf of Ashok Gehlot.

The two were detained from Udaipur and Ajmer late on Friday night.

The SOG claimed that it had intercepted the phone conversation of the two while probing an arms deal case in June and found that they were talking about BJP’s alleged plans to topple the Gehlot government.

The officials claimed that based on this conversation, the two were arrested under IPC sections 124 A (sedition) and 120 B (criminal conspiracy). Both the accused were sent to two days of police custody after being produced in court on Saturday evening. A four-member team of officials has been constituted for supervision of the case.

According to officials, the accused discussed the alleged rift between Gehlot and his deputy Sachin Pilot as an opportunity for the BJP to lure Congress MLAs.

The accused were identified as Ashok Singh Chouhan (57) from Udaipur and Bharat Malani (43) from Ajmer.

Their mobile phones were put on surveillance on June 13 after the SOG learnt from a source that the duo might be linked to a mafia dealing in arms and explosives. Police officers investigating the case heard the duo’s conversations on politics and after gathering information for nearly a month lodged the FIR on Friday.

ADG (SOG and ATS) Ashok Rathore said, “In a phone conversation the duo could be heard talking about attempts to topple the state government before the Rajya Sabha elections (held on June 19). They were heard discussing to try and lure MLAs with crores of rupees.”

According to the FIR, Chouhan and Malani spoke about how a new CM could be appointed after toppling the present government. The officials claimed that the arrested wanted a leader from the BJP to become the chief minister and give Sachin Pilot a place in the Union ministry.

“During their conversation, the duo talked about deputy CM’s visit to Delhi and in case the present government topples, they would make around Rs 1,000 crore to Rs 2,000 crore. They said while the BJP wanted the next CM to be from its ranks, the deputy CM was eyeing the post,” added the official.

The two men said change of government would gain momentum after June 30, stated the FIR. They apparently discussed that they will get in touch with independent MLAs as well.

113,['12/07/2020'],Gotri hospital equipped with Li-Fi,"The technology will help in real-time monitoring of patient’ health condition

Vadodara: The GMERS Medical College and Hospital, Gotri, Vadodara’s designated Covid-19 hospital, is now equipped with Light Fidelity (Li-Fi) technology.

The technology will help in real-time monitoring of patients’ health condition inside the isolation wards while reducing exposure of all the medical professionals, who are assigned duty in such wards.

The facility was inaugurated by Dr Vinod Rao, senior IAS officer and officer on special duty for Covid-19 in Vadodara in presence of medical superintendent, dean and other doctors of Gotri hospital.

Ahmedabad-based Nav Wireless Technology Pvt Ltd which has invented the technology has set up the communication facility at the hospital.

Li-Fi is a mobile wireless technology that uses light rather than radio frequencies to transmit data.

“With the use of this technology, patients’ health conditions such as temperature, pressure, heartbeat, glucose level and respiratory conditions can be monitored through a centralised monitoring system,” said an official.

“While the risk to doctors and hospital staff of getting infected gets reduced, the technology provides a live health data monitoring system and patients too can make video-calls to their doctors and family members,” said Hardik Soni, co-founder of the firm.

“Apart from the speed factor, Li-Fi is more suitable in hospital for monitoring condition of patients without frequency interference,” said Pratik Parikh, global business head of the firm.

115,['12/07/2020'],"Govt stable, will complete full term: Gehlot","Jaipur: Amid Congress claims that BJP was trying to topple the elected government in the state, chief minister Ashok Gehlot on Saturday asserted that his government was stable and would complete its full term.

Gehlot said the present establishment had already begun preparations for winning the next assembly elections in 2023.

Addressing reporters here, the chief minister claimed that despite its best efforts to win over MLAs during the recently held Rajya Sabha elections, the BJP was taught a lesson by the Congress in the state. He further claimed that the saffron party was still into the toppling game that it played in Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh lately.

“BJP leaders are playing the game at the behest of PM Narendra Modi and home minister Amit Shah. MLAs were offered money. Rs 10 crore in advance and Rs 15 crore after the government is toppled,” the chief minister claimed.

“The BJP and its leaders have broken all limits of humanity. On the one hand, we are striving to save lives and livelihoods during the pandemic and on the other hand these people are engaged in toppling the government,” he said.

The chief minister named three BJP state leaders — leader of opposition Gulab Chand Kataria, deputy leader of opposition Rajendra Rathore and BJP state president Satish Poonia — claiming that they were carrying out the agenda of the party’s central leadership. He alleged that the BJP treats MLAs like goats and takes pride in buying them.

He said in Gujarat 14 MLAs were purchased before the Rajya Sabha elections in 2017 and recently seven MLAs resigned for the saffron party to win two Rajya Sabha seats there.

He said it was unfortunate that horse trading is done in Gujarat, the land of Mahatma Gandhi, and claimed that Rajasthan has no such history.

Gehlot further said, “If common people do not recognize the danger in time, democracy will be in peril. The country has seen many ups and downs in the last 70 years, but democracy has survived. But now these people are shaking the roots of democracy.”

After coming to power at the Centre in 2014, the BJP has turned arrogant and fascist in thinking. They have no faith in democracy, he alleged.

Cabinet reshuffle

While replying to a query, chief minister Gehlot said the decision on cabinet reshuffle will be taken by the party high command. There were rumours of an imminent cabinet reshuffle to accommodate some independents and the six BSP MLAs who joined the party.

116,['12/07/2020'],Youth denied bail ‘for his betterment’,"Amritsar: In a rare decision , an 18-year-old youth has been denied bail by the Juvenile Justice Board (JJB), Tarn Taran, on the grounds that if back in society, he could again be exposed to criminals and carried the risk of harming himself morally, psychologically and physically, thus, defeating the very purpose of justice.

Principal magistrate Anuradha, while considering the bail application of the youth, who is a resident of Bachare village in Tarn Taran, ruled that the bail could be denied on reasonable grounds for believing that the release was likely to bring the 18-year-old into association with unknown criminals or expose to him to physical, moral and psychological dangers.

Stating that while Section 12 of the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015, was a beneficial legislation intended for reform of the juvenile, mere juvenility didn’t give the right to get bail. The JJB said it was not a fit case for grant of bail to the youth since the Juvenile Justice Act was not only meant for the juvenile, but was also for the interest of the children in care and protection.

Notably, the abovesaid youth is one of the nine alleged accused involved in an explosion that took place at a vacant plot in Pandori Gola village of Tarn Taran on September 4, 2019, in which two persons were killed. A case under the Explosive Substances Act was registered in September 2019 and was re-registered by the NIA on September 23, 2019, for investigation during which it was revealed that the alleged accused were planning to target Divya Jyoti Jagriti Sansthan dera at Tarn Taran. The NIA on March 11 had filed a charge sheet at the special NIA court at Mohali.

Reacting to JJB’s decision, youth’s lawyer Jaspal Singh Munjpur questioned the risk of physical and psychological danger to him as he is being lodged along with other criminals at Amritsar central jail for the past 10 months. He said if the JJB didn’t give bail to the youth, he could turn hardliner while living with hardcore criminals in the jail whereas it would have been better if he lived in the society, take care of his widow mother and a sister. “He has been declared a juvenile, denied bail and lodged with other criminals whereas bail is his right,” he said.

The Congress MP has made the appeal in the wake of allegations from the people shifted to the CFLTC at Karakkonam regarding the unhealthy and unhygenic conditions there, which was also one of the causes that culminated in the untoward incidents that broke out at Poonthura on Friday.

The Thiruvananthapuram MP also made a five-point list, which he presented before the state government, urging the latter to ensure the implementation of the same to bring down the tension inside critical containment zones comprising Poonthura, Manikyavilakam and Puthanpally wards.

The five appeals he made are ward-wise segregation of positive cases; proper communication with the people to clear misunderstandings while also providing proper medical care following Covid-19 protocol; compassionate behaviour and supportive approach from police; supply of essential items using mobile Maveli stores during specified timings, including facility for mobile ATMs, and distribution of provision kits through daily subsistence.

The MP also condemned the unpleasant incidents that occurred at Poonthura on Friday, especially the attack against the health workers. He also said it was equally wrong to discriminate against or isolate the people of Poonthura, mostly fisherfolk who braved their lives to save many during the 2018 floods.

Meanwhile, senior Congress leader Oommen Chandy issued a statement on Saturday dismissing the government’s allegation that the conflict at Poonthura was a result of the political conspiracy hatched by the opposition. He said the residents of Poonthura, most of whom are daily wagers, took to streets because they had no other options. The government failed to understand and provide their basic needs before clamping down restrictions on them, forcing them to revolt, Chandy said.

BAREILLY: Snakebites claimed the lives of two members of a family — including a six months pregnant woman — while it left another one seriously injured in Khamaria area of Dhaurahra tehsil in Lakhimpur Kheri district over the past three days.

According to family members, Pramod Kumar, 25, was sleeping on the floor of his house in Tamolipurva village on Tuesday night when he was bitten by a venomous snake in his sleep. He died even before he could get medical assistance. Three days later, early on Friday, when his 22-year-old sister-in-law (younger brother’s wife) Pooja and her 15-year-old sister Nishtha were sleeping on the floor, they were bitten by a venomous snake.

While Pooja died on her way to the hospital, the condition of Nishtha is stable.

According to divisional forest officer (DFO), Dudhwa Tiger Reserve (DTR-buffer) Anil Patel, Tamolipurva village headman had sought the help of their rescue team , but since one of the members of the team recently tested positive for Covid-19 in Dhaurahra, other members were quarantined, too.

As the rescue team could not reach the village, locals called a snake charmer who rescued the snake — a cobra -- from their house.

The DFO told TOI, “We sent a team from another range to the village, but the snake was rescued by then. According to villagers, it was a cobra, which was released into the forest far from the village.”

According to the DFO, snakebite cases increase during monsoon as holes get filled with rainwater and snakes often take shelter in houses or abandoned buildings.

Terming the incident “tragic”, Dhaurahra sub-divisional magistrate (SDM) Sunandu Sudhakaran said a team of revenue department officials had visited the grieving family to collect the details of the victims and their beneficiaries so that the process to provide then ex-gratia under the Uttar Pradesh Calamity Act could be initiated.

PANAJI: A 14-year-old girl from Orlim this week reached a step closer to her dream — to perform at New York City’s iconic Carnegie Hall.

Anthea Dias, a Class IX student at Fatima Convent high school, Margao, was recently named winner in an online competition run by Progressive Musicians. The winners’ recital, originally scheduled for December, has been postponed to July next year due to the Covid-19 pandemic.

Anthea is the only resident Indian to be declared winner in the competition, in which she played Kreisler’s Preludium and Allegro in the style of Pugnani.

Not only was the submission for the contest online, even Anthea’s practice and training sessions were conducted on WhatsApp. Her teacher, Winston Collaco, who guided her through the competition, made sure the lockdown didn’t interfere with his ward’s preparation.

“All classes moved online,” said her mother Marianela. “She visited her teacher a few times, but would send videos and audio clips on WhatsApp, and Collaco would respond with suggestions and corrections. They were busy all day, and worked as a team.” Collaco, a proponent of the Suzuki method, has been Anthea’ teacher since she began the violin at three. Under his guidance, she completed Grade 8 at nine, and at 11, earned an associate diploma from the Trinity College of Music , London (ATCL).

This competition involved participants submitting videos online, and judges evaluating their performances and giving them 15 days to improve in specific areas suggested by them. “My girl gave it her all, and practiced all day, before and after meals,” Marialena added, emphasising that Anthea set her eyes on this competition because the prize it offered was a spot on her dream stage.

Carnegie Hall, one of the world’s foremost venues for live music, has hosted luminaries across genres, from classical masters like Tchaikovsky, Bernstein, Horowitz, and Heifitz, to popular acts like the Beatles, Frank Sinatra and Judy Garland. However, while most of these played the main stage, winners of this competition will play the smaller, 268-seater Weill recital hall.

Collaco himself witnessed a performance at the Weill hall in 2006, when he was on a teacher training programme. “Never did I dare to dream that one day, one of my own students would perform on this stage 14 years later,” he said. He added that the competition is a great stepping stone for promising students like Anthea, from a small state that has no conservatory that many of her competitors are enrolled in.

Before her dream comes true next year, Anthea and the other winners will perform at an online recital on August 9 and 10.

JAIPUR: The Special Operation Group (SOG) of Rajasthan police has sought time and venue from chief minister Ashok Gehlot, deputy CM Sachin Pilot , Congress chief whip Mahesh Joshi and others, including independent MLAs, to record their statements in the alleged horse-trading case against BJP.

Ashok Rathore, the ADG of SOG and ATS, said, “We have asked the CM, deputy CM and Joshi, among other leaders, to give us time and place for when we can take their statements in the matter. We will take statements from others in the coming days.”

This move came after two persons, identified as Bharat Malani and Ashok Singh Chouhan, were arrested by the SOG over an alleged criminal conspiracy to topple the present state government.

Rathore said that at present the SOG has not found that the accused had any political affiliations and further investigation will reveal more details.

On June 11, Joshi had complained to the Anti-Corruption Bureau (ACB) that attempts were being made to lure Congress MLAs with money. Joshi had claimed that there were people at work trying to influence the voting in the Rajya Sabha elections and destabilise the state government.

The arrests, a month later, has created a political storm in the state as, according to SOG officials, the two persons discussed at length on ways to topple the present government. Officials claimed that the duo named few Congress leaders who had been allegedly approached by a BJP leader to change parties.

Through sources, police found that few Congress and independent MLAs had been offered Rs 25-25 crore for changing parties. The FIR against Chouhan and Malani mentioned that ahead of Rajya Sabha elections, Gehlot had spoken about perceived horse-trading of MLAs.

Our strategic differences with China will come into sharper focus as China grows more powerful and assertive, and this competition could increasingly play out along the unsettled Line of Actual Control (LAC). The brutality of the clash at Galwan on June 15 has demolished the existing protocols and agreements that guided the conduct of soldiers, and we could see a hotter LAC in the coming years.

Dealing with China in the future will require a comprehensive strategy that combines our diplomatic, economic, and military response. We must ensure that our military differential with China does not become so large that coercion along the LAC becomes difficult to resist. The talk about enhancing military capability conjures up visions of a larger defence budget, but capability is also about the institutional mechanisms that are a part of a nation’s security approach. I will suggest two institutional measures that only require a change in mindset to bring in greater cohesion in our strategy.

The first is our policy for the management of the LAC. Currently, responsibility for the India-China border is that of the Indo-Tibetan Border Police (ITBP) under the Ministry of home affairs (MHA). The 2019 Annual Report of the MHA states that “based on the principle of One Border, One Border-Guarding Force”, the China border has been entrusted to the ITBP. Paradoxically, the same paragraph of the report reads, “Indian Army is guarding land borders along the…LAC on China border along with ITBP”.

This is an absurd situation with two separate forces under different ministries manning the same border. The Group of Ministers constituted after the Kargil Review Committee had noted, “At present, there are instances of more than one force working on the same border and questions of conflict in command and control have been raised frequently. Multiplicity of forces on the same border has also led to lack of accountability on the part of the forces. To enforce the accountability, the principle of ‘one border one force’ may be adopted while considering deployment of forces at the border.”

Almost 20 years later, we continue to pay lip service to this principle without implementing it. This bizarre border management process also leads to fragmented capability development at the LAC. In 2018, it was announced that nine ITBP battalions would be raised to “reduce the inter-BOP (border outpost) distance” at the border. This reflects an inadequate understanding of how forces are deployed at the LAC and ignores the need to dovetail the ITBP with the Army’s deployment.

Despite the ITBP being responsible for the LAC, it is the Army that takes a lead role in border management. Army officers lead all border meetings at the LAC with the Chinese military, and all crisis management is handled by the Army, as we are witnessing today. Even as the Corps Commander at Leh plans the various contingencies for handling the stand-off with the Chinese in Eastern Ladakh, the ITBP continues to report to the MHA, a ministry that appears to have no responsibility in the current situation.

This incongruous situation of dual management of the LAC has been regularly flagged in the past but remains ignored. The Group of Ministers’ report had pointed out, “The present tendency on the part of each agency to guard its turf, even at the cost of compromising national security interests, needs to be deprecated and put down sternly.” The time has come to bite the bullet and place the ITBP under the Army’s operational control.

The second measure concerns the current nature of India’s civil-military relations. For many years the political leadership has taken the view that conventional wars are a thing of the past. There was certainly an understanding that India faces internal and external security challenges, but it was felt that these could be politically and diplomatically handled. When necessary, domestic sentiment against terror attacks emanating from Pakistan could be assuaged through limited cross-border military strikes without risking a major conflict.

This political viewpoint resulted in the absence of a regular civil-military dialogue to discuss matters of internal and external security and frame strategic plans. Consequently, the political-military interface has been primarily restricted to personnel matters, budget management, and Defence Acquisition Council meetings, the latter being reported with great fanfare in the media. The setting up of the Defence Planning Committee, headed by the National Security Adviser (NSA), added another layer between the service chiefs and the political leadership.

The politician is the ultimate decision-maker on matters of national security, but he must engage directly with the military leaders to get their inputs in the preparation of coherent strategic assessments. Now that we are faced with the enormous challenge of a powerful and assertive neighbour, it is more necessary than ever that we build in our military response options in crafting a consistent long-term strategy.

We must establish institutional mechanisms for regular information sharing and discussions on national security issues between political and military leaders. Military leaders possess detailed knowledge about force capabilities, military strategies, and routinely wargame operational contingencies along the border. Conveying this information through another conduit robs it of much of the value that comes from face-to-face interaction. The absence of a civil-military dialogue also results in the preparations of military plans that could be inconsistent with the political objectives.

It is often said that every crisis also provides an opportunity. I am certain that the government is reviewing the entire range of India-China relations and the geopolitical challenges posed by the hegemonic ambitions of China. The efficacy of our structures for civil-military strategic coordination and management of the LAC must also form part of this review.

HISAR/ROHTAK: Locust swarms on Saturday once again attacked parts of Haryana , mostly western and south-western districts of the state, including Sirsa, Bhiwani, Charkhi Dadri and Mahendragarh, though no major loss has been reported from anywhere so far. A huge locust swarm coming from Rajasthan side entered Madhosinghana, Malekan, Nanakpur, Mangala and Rangri Kherai villages of Sirsa district. While the farmers claimed the swarm to be 15-20km long, the agriculture department officials said it was two-km long and two-km wide.

According to the villagers, the locusts first entered Madhosinghana village at around 2.30pm and then spread over to more areas covering Modia Khera, Chauburja, Rangari Khera, Malekan and Nanakpur villages.

As the swarm entered the area, the villagers, agriculture department employees and police personnel started making noise to scare them away, they said.

Rangari Khera village sarpanch Chandrashekhar said when the locust swarm came to the village, it felt like a dark cloud covering the sky. He said the locust swarm is sitting on the cotton plant and the villagers are trying to scare them away.

Mahendragarh district saw locusts entering on Friday night and then moved to Bhiwani on Saturday morning and reached Charkhi Dadri district by the evening.

Farmers in these districts made loud noise to prevent the insects from settling on their cotton and bajra crops, while the district administration carried out sprays to eliminate the locusts.

In Mahendragarh, locusts settled in Kurahwata, Palri Panihari and nearby villages, while the swarm reached Loharu side of Bhiwani district, and in Charkhi Dadri districts, locusts visited Hindola, Lamba, Kohlawas, Kasni and Saunf villages. A farmer in Charkhi Dadri said they were taking all precautions and measures to not allow the locusts to settle on the crops.

129,['12/07/2020'],‘Religious societies fleecing potential immigrants’,"Jalandhar: The British Columbia Gurdwaras Council (BCGC) and Ontario Gurdwaras Committee (OGC) have written to Canadian immigration refugees and citizenship minister Marco, claimimg that there were hundreds of registered non-profit societies and charitable societies, apparently operating under Sikh names, involved in immigration fraud cases by sponsoring religious workers through illegal means and then abandoning them.

In a letter to the minister, BCGC spokesperson Moninder Singh and OGC spokesperson Amarjit Singh Mann have sought a meeting with the minister.

They mentioned there was a sharp rise in cases of potential immigrants paying tens of thousands of dollars to these societies to secure ‘Work Permits’.

They described the trend as shocking and undermining the immigration process and laws in Canada.

This letter comes close on the heels of a Sikh man holding a press conference in Surrey, alleging that he was defrauded by members of management of a gurdwara in Abbotsford who used the name of some other “Sikh organization” to sponsor him, but then turned back from their promises.

“There have been longstanding procedures in place to manage the movement of genuine Sikh religious workers in response to fraud. These procedures were designed with input from the various parties involved in this process (including gurdwaras) to meet the needs for religious workers, while ensuring the integrity of the immigration/visa process as well. In April 2012, new procedures were introduced to ensure there was more control over the issuance of invitations by gurdwaras in Canada to religious workers. This allowed the ability to track and maintain a record of the number of religious workers at any given gurdwara in Canada at any given time,” BCGC and OGC spokespersons have said.

“While this process may have seen some early success, there are now hundreds (if not thousands) of registered non-profit societies and charitable societies that operate under pretenses within Canada.

“These societies are engaging with immigration process and potential immigrants in fraud, blackmail, and threatening type behavior. This behavior cannot be allowed to continue and stricter measures must be put in place to ensure innocent individuals do not become victims of immigration fraud and the perpetrators of these offences continue to financially gain from this illegal activity,” they have said.

“Potential immigrants to Canada are often fleeing poverty, state-sponsored violence, genocide and oppression and to be further marginalized by this type of illegal and fraudulent behavior, through individuals and societies in Canada, is unacceptable,” they have added in the letter.

JODHPUR: Union Jal Shakti minister Gajendra Singh Shekhawat has termed Ashok Gehlot ’s theory about horse trading of its MLAs a cooked up story created by the chief minister himself. Shekhawat, who reached his hometown on Saturday, shot a barrage of questions to Gehlot on the issue.

Shekhawat compared these allegations with the film industry’s publicity stunts.

Stating that the chief minister was himself the script writer, producer, director, actor and villain of this film, Shekhawat said if Gehlot was right, he should come with the name of the MLAs whom he considered saleable and share evidence to corroborate the allegations.

He alleged that Gehlot had fabricated this entire episode to defame and eliminate his party president and deputy chief minister for his personal political gains.

“If the BJP has attempted to destablise the state government, Gehlot should share evidence of it instead of cooking up stories,” he said, calling upon the SOG to conduct a free and fair probe into these allegations.

He said Gehlot leveled fabricated allegations on the BJP leadership and he himself gave contradictory statements.

“On one hand he has been claiming that there was a renewed organised attempt to pull down the state government, while on the other he has been saying he has no idea advising it to the SOG”, he said.

JAIPUR: The Anti-Corruption Bureau (ACB) has launched a preliminary inquiry against three independent MLAs for alleged involvement in offering money to few of their counterparts for toppling the ruling government.

According to ACB sources, investigation has been initiated against Om Prakash Hudla, Suresh Tak and Khushveer Singh. “The names of MLAs came up during an investigation of attempts to indulge in horse-trading and at present a preliminary investigation has been initiated to check the veracity of the allegations.”

Sources claimed that ACB will try to get the phone records of the MLAs and further details. “The probe is still in its infancy and we will gather facts and evidence as the investigation progresses,” said an official.

After SOG arrested the two accused, officials claimed that they till now have only intercepted their phone records and no one else was currently being monitored. Also cops said that they would look into the possibility that the arrests and the alleged involvement of the independent MLAs are part of a bigger conspiracy.

This has proved immensely helpful for the contact-tracing team. Being a technician, he had been on assignments to houses, offices and institutions from Thiruvananthapuram to Kollam and he kept a copy of all contact details and when the health team contacted him as part of tracing exercise, he handed over the data that was ready with him.Right from the onset of symptoms, he confined himself to home and sought medical help at Vellanad community health centre. He was given medication and he went to room isolation at home. He had read about the possible symptoms of Covid-19 and when he lost his sense of smell and taste and symptoms did not relieve after one week, he contacted the health team in his panchayat. He waited till an ambulance arrived and he went to give his swab at General Hospital on Tuesday night.He had attended Sunday prayer in the church near his house last week. He did not have any symptoms that day. He could effectively recount the contacts at the church, the people he had met as part of his job and communicate it to the disease-investigation team. “I have my parents, grandmother and brother at home. I have done my best to isolate myself from them ever since I had symptoms. I have also handed over all contact details to the health team. I feel better now but I cannot sense any taste or smell,’’ he said. He is undergoing treatment at General Hospital.His friends who accompanied him to Vellanad hospital when he had developed symptoms for the first time are also under room isolation. “We decided to go into room isolation because they had gotten in contact with me. It started off with body pain, later I experienced all symptoms about which I had read,’’ he said.He is not sure where he would have contracted infection from.

In the Covid scenario, this is in the interest of the economy and of the nation,” Tripathi said.Responding to this, Roy said, “This is a public health emergency and we expect all to be responsible. This is not about a company’s profits, but about people’s lives and we are dealing with a disaster. I am not here to negotiate.” Industry sources said that the south Goa collector’s order to shut down Tulip Diagnostics for 14 days came after the company attempted to hide it when its workers tested positive for the virus. Two workers of Tulip Diagnostics, who had come from an infected zone were the first to test positive but the company did not inform GSIA, officials said.The ministry of health and family welfare’s guidelines on preventive measures to contain the spread of the coronavirus in the workplace says that if positive cases are detected, the entire building will have to be closed for 48 hours after thorough disinfection.However, the state government has called for the industrial units to be shut for 14 days. Goa Chamber of Commerce and Industry along with the Goa State Industries Association have written to the authorities asking them to reconsider this directive.“We feel that the units should be properly disinfected after which all those who test negative for Covid-19 should be allowed to resume work. In view of MHA guidelines, we feel that the order to shut down these seven units for 14 days is a bit harsh and unwarranted,” GCCI chairman Manoj Caculo said.GSIA president Damodar Kochkar said that while industry is ready to cooperate with the government, a 14-day shutdown was uncalled for. “We have supported the government every time on the Covid-19 matter, but they didn’t consult us when they decided to shut down industries. If they feel we must take additional preventive measures, we are open to it.

CHANDIGARH: Punjab has sought permission to adhere to its July 3 decision on cancellation of university and college examinations in view of the exponentially rising Covid-19 cases . Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh has written to the Prime Minister Narendra Modi , urging to advise the Union ministry of human resource development (MHRD) and the University Grants Commission (UGC) to reconsider its decision on mandatory conduct of final term exams by September.

“UGC may be asked to reiterate its earlier issued guidelines of April 29, wherein it had been clearly mentioned that the guidelines were advisory in nature and each state/university would chart out its own plan of action taking into consideration the issues pertaining to Covid-19 pandemic,” he urged the Prime Minister.

Amarinder noted that the state government, after due deliberation and taking into account the Covid-19 situation and attendant issues of safety of students and staff, had on July 3, decided to cancel all pending UG and PG final term examinations and to promote students on the basis of performance in previous years/semesters.

“In addition, we have also allowed conduct of examination for the purpose of improvement of grades for interested students, once the situation becomes conducive,” Captain Amarinder pointed out, stressing that “This would ensure academic credibility, career opportunities, future prospects and fair and equal opportunity for students in both urban and rural areas.”

“In view of this rising trend of cases, I am not sure whether the situation will be conducive for conducting offline physical examinations by September,” he said, adding that conducting physical examination will also involve huge logistical and operational challenges. On the other hand, Amarinder said, “Conducting online examinations for such a large number of students, majority of whom reside in rural areas without assured access to computers/laptops and internet, is also not possible in the state.”

Dr Chandresh Jardosh, president of IMA Gujarat, said that so far during the epidemic, the government and doctors have worked shoulder-to-shoulder. “Such statements create atmosphere of mistrust, which is undesirable,” he said.

“Contactless waste collection is followed when workers go door-to-door. Health camps and Covid-19 testing are conducted periodically to monitor the health of our workers. People need not panic,” S Sivasubramanian, corporation commissioner said.

On June 25, the first such facility was launched at the LNJP hospital by chief minister Arvind Kejriwal.“Most of the patients admitted in these hospitals are senior citizens who are not very tech savvy. Even though phones are allowed, many don’t have smartphones or don’t know how to make video calls,” a Delhi government official said. “This is why the CM started the video call facility at LNJP and was keen on starting similar facilities in other dedicated Covid hospitals as well,” he said.The official said that even though helpdesks are also available at the hospitals to make calls, relatives remained worried as they couldn’t see the patients. “Taking to the patient over video enhances the experience for the family members,” he said.Both RGSS and GTB hospitals have a tablet for each ward. “There are separate booths for patients to make video calls to relatives. Hospital attendants assist them in connecting the calls and even bring the tablets closer to the patients,” the official said.The official said that seeing and talking to their relatives also brings some cheer to patients and helps them develop mental strength, which is much required in fighting Covid-19.",delhi,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-76916903,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-175244,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/gtb-among-two-hospitals-to-get-video-calling-facility/articleshow/76916467.cms

159,['12/07/2020'],Farmers seek more water in channels for paddy irrigation,"Thanjavur: Even as officials are claiming that more than 90% of desilting works being carried out by the public works department (PWD) in delta districts are complete, farmers from a village in Thanjavur alleged that their irrigation channel was not getting the required quantum of water flow forcing them to water their paddy nursery by carrying water in pots. The farmers also staged a protest by pouring paddy seeds in front of PWD office in Thanjavur on Saturday.

Water was released from Kallanai (Grand Anaicut) for delta irrigation on June 16. Farmers, meanwhile, from Kandiyur and surrounding villages in Thanjavur district had already started raising paddy nursery with the help of bore wells in around 100 acres , farmers said.

Meanwhile, their main irrigation sources such as Thiruvalampozhil , Sankarakulam, Thiruthukkal and Kandiyur channels received a very low flow of water. As the water is flowing at the bottom of the channels, farmers are unable to irrigate the nursery and hence, the y are forced to carry water in pots, P Sugumaran, a farmer from Thiruvaiyaru said.

The irrigation channels would get water from Kudamurutti river only after the water released in the river is enhanced to 2,800 cusecs from Cauvery. However, only 1,000 cusecs have been released in the river now.

Meanwhile, the PWD officials had stated that the farmers from Kandiyur and surrounding villages usually take up samba cultivation. Only during the samba season water would be released in these four channels. Slamming the PWD officials’ remarks, around 100 farmers protested at the PWD office in Thanjavur.

After PWD official's assurance to release water on the four channels, the farmers dispersed from the office. tnn

HYDERABAD: While Telangana conducted a record 11,062 tests on Saturday — highest single-day figure till date — the state’s daily count of Covid-19 positive cases dropped further to 1,178. As many as nine more patients succumbed to the virus over last 24 hours. On Friday, the state had tested 10,354 samples and recorded 1,278 cases.

With this, Telangana’s death toll now stands at 348 while the total positive cases’ tally has touched 33,403.

The sudden jump in count of tests, officials said, was on account of the rapid antigen tests that have begun in the state. “Also 13 private laboratories that were found flouting norms and were given an ultimatum, to make necessary changes, have completed the mandatory procedures and come back in to the fold. As a result, testing has nearly doubled in the state over the last three days,” said a senior official from the state health department. They, however, remained mum when asked about the dropping positive cases, despite higher rate of testing.

Among districts, Khammam, Nalgonda and Rajanna Sircilla were among the latest to see a surge in cases, while Ranga Reddy and Medchal districts continued to clock big numbers. In fact, both the districts have recorded over 100 cases per day, over the last few days.

an appeal was made to the public not to panic and avail telemedicine service on the government helpline number- 180059912345- in case of any Covid-19 symptoms.

NAGPUR: Dr Kush Jhunjhunwala , immediate past president of the Nagpur branch of Indian Medical Association (IMA), has been honoured with the institution’s prestigious national award. The awards are given every year on the occasion of Doctor’s Day. This year, they were announced on July 8. In all, 87 doctors from across the country were chosen for their exemplary work after the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic. Dr Jhunjhunwala is the only one from Vidarbha to get the award.

As president of IMA Nagpur during 2019-20, Dr Jhunjhunwala led a project under which IMA members conducted health check-ups for more than 15,000 migrant labourers during Lockdown 1.

“This award has come as a surprise for me. IMA Nagpur shouldered the responsibility of the health check-up of migrant labourers to be sent back to their respective states. We conducted many health check-up camps at several places during the lockdown period and issued health certificates,” said Dr Jhunjhunwala.

The camps were held at Panjhari Naka, Pardi Naka and NMC School, Bijli Nagar . IMA members examined and certified more than 15000 migrant labourers free of cost.

Apart from the health check-up, IMA Nagpur also distributed toilet kits to the needy women labourers. The kits include soap, sanitary pads, cotton and disposable bags. The kits helped women labourers to maintain personal hygiene.

“It was team work. The credit of this award goes to every member of IMA who worked on this project. We are also thankful to the police department, the district administration and many NGOs for helping us to organize the camps,” said Dr Jhunjhunwala.

166,['12/07/2020'],‘Hospitality industry is heading for doom if lockdown continues’,"The three-month nationwide lockdown has severely crippled every industry, but the tourism and hospitality sector has been hit the hardest across the globe. With no end in sight due to the Covid-19 pandemic, the future of the hospitality industry looks extremely bleak as tourists are avoiding travelling until a vaccine is developed.

The Maharashtra government recently allowed hotels to reopen with 33% capacity after a meeting with a delegation of aggrieved hoteliers. However, the response has been extremely poor, according to Nagpur Residential Hotels’ Association (NRHA) president Tejinder Singh Renu .

In an interview with TOI, Renu speaks about how the industry is in deep trouble due to zero income in the lockdown period and why the centre and state government need to grant them a rescue package immediately.

Excerpts...

Q. How many members are part of the NRHA?

A. The NRHA was formed in 2010 when the local authorities imposed draconian measures in accordance with the newly enacted Maharashtra Fire Prevention and Life Safety Measures Act 2006. As it was implemented retrospectively, we needed to fight against it unitedly. Currently, we’ve 96 members, which includes only those having rooms to stay. A couple of service apartments are also in our team.

Q. How has the response been after the government allowed the reopening of hotels?

A. It’s extremely poor. As Nagpur isn’t a tourist place, only those with commercial and business interests come here and stay at hotels. Now with restrictions in place on transportation like flights, trains and buses, visitors aren’t coming to the city. Our only meagre source of income is quarantine patients who are arriving from other cities or countries and are made to mandatorily stay in hotels for about a week. Since their numbers are very low, unlike in Mumbai and Pune, not many hotels are benefiting.

Q. Should the 33% cap on number of customers be implemented in a city like Nagpur where cases are not as much as in Mumbai or Pune?

A. The government should delegate authority to local officials regarding the handling of such matters as the situation differs in every region and district. You can’t set uniform rules for all. Our apex body — Federation of Hotels and Restaurant Association of India (FHRAI) in Delhi — has already submitted many representations to the central ministries regarding our grievances and the state body — Hotels and Restaurants Association of Western India (HRAWI) has approached the state authorities. We also listed our grievances with the civic authorities and met guardian minister Nitin Raut as well. However, we’re yet to receive any positive response from all of them.

Q. How are hotels coping with the current situation?

A. Our major source of income is restaurants and banquet halls for marriages, birthdays and other events like seminars. The government is allowing only 50 persons for marriage-related functions and a maximum of 15 for other meeting and seminars, but those having bigger halls of 5,000 or 10,000 capacity are suffering. We’re requesting the government to grant relaxation as per square metre area so that more visitors could be allowed while maintaining Covid distancing. We also requested the government to allow us to reopen restaurants with all safety mechanisms like mandatory masks, sanitizers, temperature checking and Covid distancing. At least we’re in a position to allow customers only if they are following norms. If you visit any market area, you can see complete chaos with hardly any norms being followed by citizens and sellers, but no authority acts against them.

Q. What about the staff? Are they continuing or have they left for their native place?

A. Fortunately for us, very few are from outside the city. We’ve managed to retain the local ones by paying them part salary. Most of them have been working with us since two to three decades and they have nowhere to go. Since the reopening, they have been coming, but there’s hardly any work to do due to the absence of customers. Those staying outside are unwilling to come back. However, those associated with leading hotel chains have been laid off due to mounting losses.

Q. What does the future look like for hotels?

A. In a city like Nagpur, it’s bleak unless the government steps in. We suffer losses everyday due to zero occupancy. Barring a few, the majority are budget hotels which are providing rooms for as low as Rs300 onwards. Due to the three-month closure, equipment like deep freezers have developed a snag. Many hotel owners are already talking about closing down and exploring new businesses due to massive losses. They’re thinking of entering the garment business as their hotels are located in the market area. The entire situation is very tricky and uncertain as tourists wouldn’t venture out in the near future unless there’s an emergency or some official work.

Q. What are your expectations from the government?

A. Like in the United Kingdom, where the government is paying half the bill on the customer’s behalf, our government could also come up with such innovative concepts. We’ve requested the Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) to allow us to pay property taxes as per residential rate and also to the state government to charge industrial tariff for electricity consumed as our establishments were closed for three months. Our biggest expenditure is the property tax & electricity bills and such rebates could help us to survive.

They did so and left,” a police source said.

Qureshi stated that he later took Inayat to a private doctor who referred him to LG Hospital, where he died during treatment.

Speaking to reporters in Pudukottai on Saturday, the health minister said that plasma therapy has been permitted by the central government in 44 centres across India. “The Rajiv Gandhi government general hospital (RGGGH) in Chennai has led the way across the country by performing the highest number of plasma therapies on 26 patients so far. Of these, 24 patients have already been cured and discharged,” Vijayabaskar said.

He added that chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswami advised the health department to expand the plasma therapy to more patients.

The health minister also said that Covid-19 death rate in the state has been brought down because of the availability of required medical facilities.

Vijayabaskar said that the work on setting up the Covid-19 testing centre and oxygen pipeline in government, taluk and other hospitals in the state was being taken up.

He also reiterated the contribution of the Indian medicine and homoeopathy department in the fight against Covid-19. “In an attempt to give importance to India medicine, costly drugs are being kept ready in all government hospitals. The integrated treatment incorporating siddha and ayurvedha medicines is being provided to patients in all the Covid treatment centres in the state. This has resulted in the recovery of patients,” he said adding that yoga and breathing exercises were also part of their treatment.

The minister also highlighted the increase in number of beds with the provision for oxygen supply and the procurement of latest equipment to provide up to 60 litres of oxygen to each patient.

He added that Covid-19 patients are also given mental health programmes.

171,['12/07/2020'],Saturday the new Sunday for meat lovers,"Trichy: With Sundays set to witness a complete lockdown, people on Saturday thronged meat stalls to stock up their favourite meat and seafood. These stalls in the city witnessed a big surge in footfalls, similar to that seen on Sundays.

The government had announced a complete lockdown on Sundays throughout July to contain public movement and thereby limit fresh Covid-19 infections. Since non-vegetarian food lovers have their favourite dish on Sundays and customarily make the purchase on the day, the complete lockdown has been playing spoilsport. Having had a bitter experience last Sunday, residents seem to have decided to advance their purchase to Saturday from now on.

“With complete lockdown on Sundays, people are turning up more on Saturdays. Sales have increased significantly compared to the normal Saturdays,” N Balakrishnan, a chicken stall owner in Bhima Nagar said. Poultry stall owners say they usually sell 1,000 to 1,200 kilogram of chicken meat and about 3,000 eggs on Sundays.

On Saturday, they managed to achieve 75% of Sunday’s sales. Fish markets at Puthur and Gandhi market saw brisk sales and appeared crowded as well. Anticipating a surge in crowds, Trichy corporation deputed supervision teams to penalise people not wearing face masks. “In Gandhi market shops alone, we have collected Rs 1,500 as penalty from people not wearing facemasks on Saturday,” a sanitary official with the corporation said. Civic body officials added that they will intensify the supervision on the coming Saturdays too apart from sensitising fish and meat stalls to ensure social distancing with the increasing footfall.

172,['12/07/2020'],Fewer containment zones in rural Nashik,"Health workers conducting a survey in Lasalgaon

NASHIK: The number of containment zones in the rural areas of the district has come down in the past few days despite the number of Covid-19 cases rising.

The increase in the number of new cases being identified is offset by the growing number of people being discharged. That is why the number of containment zones has been reduced by the health department.

“Just 21 days ago, we had 471 containment zones. Today, we have 375 containment zones – 96 fewer than before. The number has been falling since there have been no fresh cases in the specific areas in a 28-day period,” district health officer Kapil Aher said.

Currently, 1.57 lakh people are containment zones across the 15 talukas of the district, excluding the municipal corporation areas of Nashik and Malegaon. “This indicates that most of the new cases are high-risk contacts of the people already tested positive. The other reason for the rise in cases is the intensive survey being carried out in the containment zones,” Aher said.

The officer said there were 566 teams, each comprising two members, surveying the containment zones to find people with symptoms and direct them to the health system for further investigation and the treatment as required.

“Many of the teams are carrying pulse oximeters during the survey. They identify people whom they believe are symptomatic and take them to hospitals. Citizens’ health is scanned and if required the swabs are taken,” the officer added.

VADODARA: Beer being sprayed freely, multiple cakes , a large group, a sword to cut the cake and no one wearing mask– hardly looked like a birthday celebration in the state particularly in times of Covid-19.

But videos of this celebration held near Virpur in Mahisagar district went viral sparking a major row as it was alleged that members of the Gujarat State Youth Board and BJP were a part of the celebrations. The viral videos are said to be of Friday when a youth Kavan Patel was to celebrate his birthday. Friends and aides can be seen with him in the video. At least half a dozen cakes were displayed on the bonnet of a car.

After being sprayed upon with beer, Patel is seen cutting the cake with a sword amidst loud cheers.

The police registered an offence and arrested 13 persons based on the footage it had received.

Deputy superintendent of police N V Patel said that the offence registered at the Virpur police station was for violation of notification and the prohibition law.

Balashinor MLA Ajitsinh Chauhan from the opposition Congress slammed the act and said that the police was dragging its feet in taking action, but the cops denied the allegations. Chauhan even claimed that the incident had taken place around 200metres from the Virpur police station. He claimed that members of youth BJP were involved in the celebrations.

Mahisagar BJP president J P Patel said that no office bearer of the BJP was involved in the incident. He added that the youth board will take action if anyone was involved and said that the police had already swung into action.

MUZAFFARNAGAR: Every evening, after the day’s work was done, children at an ashram in Shukratal, 30km from Muzaffarnagar, would wait in dread. The manager, they knew, would force them to drink alcohol calling it “coronavirus medicine”, watch porn and then sexually abuse them. If they refused, they would be beaten up.For years, children have been sent to the ashram by trusting parents with limited means in hopes of a good education. But the ashram hid hell. “Maharaj would make us drink coronavirus medicine. Then he’d get naked and lie down, show us dirty films and do bad things to us,” said a 10-year-old from Mizoram in a statement to the Child Welfare Committee , which TOI has gained access to. The boy was among 10 rescued early this week after a tip-off from a whistleblower who had been evicted for objecting to the sexual abuse. The children are from Tripura and Mizoram — nine between seven and 16, and one 18. Medical examination confirmed four of them had been sexually assaulted, an FIR at the Bhopa police station said.“I was brought here in October 2017 by the ashram’s cook. I lived like a slave, was asked to massage Maharaj and bring him alcohol and bidis,” said a 13-year-old from Tripura. “He would sodomise me.” Refusal to submit had consequences. “Saying no would lead to a thrashing,” said an 18-year-old from Tripura. The 10-year-old from Mizoram said the same, “If we refused, he would beat us.” Money their parents sent would be appropriated as “living costs”. The cook, Govind Das, recurs in the children’s accounts as the person who brought them to the ashram.The “Maharaj” spoken of is a 'godman', Bhakti Bhushan Govind , who had been running the ashram with an associate, Mohan Das. The two have been arrested with charges under the Pocso Act, and the IPC for unnatural offences and voluntarily causing hurt. The ashram had not been registered under the Juvenile Justice Act.“The Maharaj is a resident of Sisauli village (65 km from Meerut). He set up the ashram 12 years ago,” Muzaffarnagar SSP Abhishek Yadav said. He has no prior record. Locals said he had amassed donations in his previous stint as a godman in Chandigarh, which he used to set up his ashram here. The children had been engaged in the construction of the grand two-storeyed ashram building, they added.The horrors came to light after an inmate, Hari Om, intervened. “I spoke to one of the children and was horrified. When Maharaj got to know I was trying to probe them, he kicked me out,” he said. So he called Childline. “What he said was very disturbing,” said Poonam Sharma, director of the Muzaffarnagar chapter of Childline. Her team, along with Bhopa Police, raided the ashram and rescued the children.

PUNE: Thousands of citizens were seen on city streets making purchases in preparation for the total lockdown starting from July 14. The large crowd led to major traffic congestion in several neighbourhood.

The Pune police installed barricades in several areas to curb movement of people and vehicles in anticipation of the total lockdown. Citizens were further irked by the move since the blockades caused a great inconvenience.

Heavy traffic was observed on Saturday morning at Salunkhe Vihar road, Market Yard, Tilak road and several other areas, where marketplaces are located. There was heavy traffic on Karve road until late in the evening with a sizeable number of cars vying for road space.

Pramod Deshmukh, a working professional, said, “The road to Mukundnagar was blocked at Laxminarayan Talkies junction so the entire peripheral area was choked on Saturday afternoon. Sarasbaug, Satara Road, Market Yard were completely blocked. I took close to an hour to get out of the traffic.”

Deshmukh faced traffic congestion at Tilak road as well. “I tried to follow online maps to avoid traffic but that didn’t help,” he said.

A resident of Salunkhe Vihar road Harsh Basur said, “The traffic in this area has been crazy since Saturday morning. Most lanes coming to Salunke Vihar road from Wanowrie have been blocked for many days now. However, the traffic was moving smoothly before Saturday. It was only after the lockdown was announced that the traffic increased. Traffic coming to Salunke Vihar Road from Samvidhan chowk was also at a near standstill for quite a while.”

Payal Joshi, who went to Mahatma Phule Mandai to buy vegetables, said, “I did not encounter much traffic while riding in the city areas but finding parking space was a hassle. It looked like everyone was out on the roads. The scene around Mandai was what we would see before the pandemic hit Pune. There were people everywhere, walking on the streets and crowding vegetable stalls,” she explained.

According to the city police, greater traffic was witnessed as people stepped out to purchase essentials before the lockdown. “A lot of double parking was also noticed around grocery stores and markets. This narrowed the carriageway in different parts of the city. We had to seek help from local police stations to man the traffic during the peak hours,” an officer stated.

He earned between Rs1,500 and Rs3,500 on an average each day then. His earnings dipped to Rs600-700 per day when he took up selling vegetables and later it nosedived to around Rs100 a day because of stiff competition.Awtare is presently earning Rs500-700 a day by selling masks. After a fortnight, he might again change the profession if his current venture does not fulfil his financial needs.“Things were not great for me even before the lockdown. I have a wife and two children to take care of. I bought my own car three years ago but was always under financial stress. Things got out of hand once the lockdown was announced. My car was taken away by the finance company as I was unable to pay the monthly instalments,” Awtare told TOI.He tried his hand at selling vegetables after the car was taken away. “Sitting at home and waiting for things to be fine isn’t an option for poor people like us. So, I started to sell vegetables. Soon, I saw more and more people turning into vegetable vendors. The increase in competition mounted to losses and I gave up selling vegetables after a month,” he said.Awtare then took to selling masks. “I hang the masks for sale on a temporary stand near a petrol pump on Sinhagad Road while keeping a lookout for police. They come and confiscate whatever people are selling by the roadside. I cannot put up my shop often because of the rains. The sale of masks isn’t very good either,” he said.“My landlord has been kind enough to waive the monthly house rent for the time being. While I want to drive again, the cab business is suffering too. I might switch professions again if things don’t improve,” Awtare added.",pune,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-76918882,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-717221,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/car-confiscation-turns-cabbie-into-vegetable-vendor-but-poor-income-forces-him-to-sell-masks-for-a-living/articleshow/76916287.cms

MEERUT: A 20-year-old Industrial Training Institute student from Meerut is believed to have been killed by four “friends”, who hacked his body into pieces and dumped them in a 40-feet borewell about 18km from the city. No body part has been found yet and the four youths are in police detention.

On June 25, Rupak went out for a party with his “friends” but did not make it back home. Worried, his family filed a complaint with the local police the following day. A search began. The obvious trail led to the people he was last known to be with, his four “friends”.

Police said the four of them confessed to having killed Rupak. “There seems to have been a confrontation between Rupak and the prime suspect, Vikas, over Rupak’s sister which turned violent,” SP (city), Meerut, Akhilesh Narayan Singh said. “They are believed to have shot him, after which they buried his body in a field near a brick kiln. But worried they might be caught, they exhumed the body,” Pankaj Singh, circle officer of Daurala, said.

But SP (city), Meerut, Akhilesh Narayan Singh said the suspects could also be “misleading” the police. “They said initially that his body had been buried in a field. Later, they said it had been cut into pieces and dumped inside a borewell,” he said.

The borewell is at Jataula village in Rohta, about 18 km from Meerut. “A tunnel is being dug to reach the bottom of the borewell. We have started digging around it with cranes and earth movers,” he added.

No body part has been found yet — police said they must have slipped to the bottom of the borewell. So while the four youths remain in detention, no formal arrest has been made.

Bhushan Patwardhan

firmly believes examination is an integral part of the academic system. He told TOI in an

online interview

that cancelling

exams

, citing the Covid-19 situation, would have a long-term negative impact on

students

’ careers. Excerpts:

How should

Savitribai Phule Pune University

(SPPU) conduct the exams, considering the spurt in Covid-19 cases in Pune?

Now that most hostels of varsities are vacated, what happens if a student in a remote area can’t take the online exam because of connectivity/gadget issues?

The

Maharashtra

government has stressed that it is impossible to conduct the final-year exams by September because of the Covid-19 situation. Your take?

Why the UGC is firm on conducting the exams when the pandemic is peaking?

What if no exams are conducted?

Will the students be affected if there are no exams?

Is there a possibility of average students gaining from no exams?

Then why students are clamouring against exams?

Several faculty members claimed that many universities would not be able to conduct exams by September 30 because there is too little time to prepare.

Not just SPPU but any university, can go for online, offline, a combination of both or open book exam, depending on what suits which course the best. If the university decides to go for offline exam for some subjects, they should ensure all safety protocols, including physical distance and sanitisation norms, prescribed by the UGC.The UGC has allowed varsities or colleges to give such students one-time special examination. Such examinations can be proctored or conducted in different cities/towns with the help of local government bodies.Agreeably, there are real challenges in conducting examinations in the Covid-19 situation. But when there is a will, there is a way. During Unlock-1, liquor shops and salons were reopened and home delivery was allowed. Now, temples are also being opened. Thus, temples of knowledge can also be reopened with all safety measures and precautions.Exams are an integral part of the academic life-cycle. Will you trust a doctor who has not appeared in the final exam, or an engineer or a pharmacist for that matter? Awarding academic degree without examination is not acceptable. In the US and the UK, most of the reputed universities have either completed or deferred final-year examinations. Current global picture indicates that 73 countries have postponed/rescheduled, 23 have introduced alternative approaches and 22 have maintained exams, while only 11 countries have cancelled them altogether. This scenario supports the UGC policy regarding the examinations.It will set a wrong example. Such students would be labelled as “Covid Batch”. Sanctity of their degree will remain questionable.Of course. The transcript of universities on report cards can spoil their career. If only “Pass” is written as result, many students will find it difficult to pursue higher studies. A few years down the line, there can be hardships on career progression and the job front too.No way. An average student might have prepared very well for the final exam/semester. If the exam is conducted, that particular student’s grades can improve. And, meritorious students will naturally have the chance of bettering their grades.It’s a wrong conception. I know many students who want the exams to be conducted. They may not be as vocal. We have done a great disservice by keeping them waiting so long for the exams, triggering anxiety. Teachers and parents need to tell them that such shortcuts may be very detrimental in the long run.On April 29, the UGC had told the varsities to conduct the final exams by July-end. Had the universities acted in time, many problems faced today could have been avoided. Now, we have extended the deadline till September 30. We are keeping a close watch on the situation.",pune,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-76917047,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-413002,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/degrees-sans-exams-will-impact-career-of-students/articleshow/76915879.cms

It offered a breather to the store employees too.“If Pune city can take a break, why can’t Nashik. Stringent efforts are required to stamp Covid-19 out. At least, the number of active patients will be under 300 and there will not be a strain on the health institutions,” Satish Patil, a Nashik trader, argued.However, a section of traders said that it is time that everyone learnt to live with Covid-19. “Keeping the shops closed is not the solution.

189,['12/07/2020'],NGO files DVAC complaint against Bharatnet tenders,"CHENNAI: Anti-corruption NGO Arappor Iyakkam has written to the Directorate of Vigilance and Anti-Corruption ( DVAC ) demanding a probe into the Rs 1,900-crore Bharatnet tenders floated by Tamil Nadu Fibrenet Corporation Ltd ( Tanfinet ) after the Centre directed TN government to cancel existing tenders and float fresh ones.

The tenders were floated to identify contractors to lay optic fibre cable network to provide broadband connectivity in rural areas of the state. Centre intervened in the process after Arappor Iyakkam and a few private companies wrote to TN and central government agencies about how corrigenda to the tender had changed conditions favouring a select group of companies. The complaints pertained to non-compliance of public procurement (preference to make in India) order of 2017.

On June 26, the department of promotion of industry and internal trade (DPIIT) had ordered scrapping of the tenders and asked Tanfinet to re-invite bids with non-restrictive qualification criteria.

In the representation sent to DVAC on Saturday, the NGO’s convenor Jayaram Venkatesan said a cognisable offence has been made out against state government officials involved in framing the tender conditions. “An FIR should be filed and top IAS officials and other public officials should be investigated by the state anti-corruption agency,” Jayaram said.

Reiterating this, A P Suryaprakasam, an advocate at the Madras high court, said a case was made out. “Since tender conditions have been tweaked in favour of one party, a criminal intention is established. It amounts to cheating or criminal breach of trust as the officials were dealing with public money and the objective should have been honesty,” he said.

Retired IAS official M G Devasahayam said from an administrative point of view, sending a complaint to the state vigilance wing was the correct thing to do. “The question is, however, whether the state government will act upon it. Since the Centre is involved in this, a complaint should also be sent to the Central Vigilance Commission,” he said.

The project has been in trouble since January, when then IT secretary Santosh Babu was shunted out.

As many as 400 autorickshaws and private cabs each will operate as a part of the on-call service. Pre-paid autorickshaws and sanitized cabs will also be available at the airport. Over 500 cabs will be operational as part of “Book2Ride”, an app-based cab service, its founder Kunal Kharat, said.

“During the earlier lockdown phases, the police, in association with a private company, operated the ‘autorickshaw on call’ service, which will continue. Around 400 private cabs will be operational for travel to the airport and back. They will get passes via the company coordinating their movement,” assistant commissioner of police (traffic) Surendra Deshmukh said.

He said Ola and Uber cabs would not operate in Pune and Pimpri Chinchwad during the lockdown. Nayana Gunde, the chairperson and managing director of the PMPML, said buses would ply for essential service providers.

Pune airport authorities said the facility and flight movements would not be affected.

“At least some Ola and Uber cabs should be allowed to ply to the airport. I have to fly to Delhi on July 17 and I am already worried,” said Rudranil Bagchi, a working professional.

Rahul Shitole, who runs the CityGlide service, which will manage operations of the autorickshaws and cabs, said he would get the passes for vehicles by Sunday afternoon. Commuters can book an autorickshaw or cab via WhatsApp message to 9859198591 or by messaging “@RahulShitole11” on Twitter with details of travel.

Kharat said commuters can download “Book2Ride” application on their cellphones or call 020-66100100 to book the cabs. “The pickup or drop point has to be either the airport, railway station or a hospital,” he said.

Deshmukh said only vehicles with passes would be allowed to ply during the 10 days.

The PPCB officials claimed that 23 dairies falling outside MC limits at Bhammian village have not installed effluent treatment plants and are discharging untreated effluents directly into Buddha Nullah. The cow dung is also not being managed properly which also ends up in the drain.

PPCB has already issued show-cause notices to all these dairies and imposed bank guarantees of Rs 1 lakh each on all the dairy owners. These dairies had also been directed to install individual treatment facility for treatment of effluents generated from their premises.

However, the dairies have failed to submit any compliance. In the show-cause notices, PPCB had warned sealing of dairies in case of failure to stop effluent flow into Buddha Nallah.

Pannu said a lot of time has already been given to the dairy owners to manage the cow dung and effluents. He said effluents being discharged into Buddha Nallah leads to pollution.

Saying that no additional time should be given to these dairies, he directed the dairies to make arrangement for the cow dung and untreated effluents immediately and give concrete proposal during their hearing already scheduled before the member secretary of PPCB on July 21.

He cautioned that a strict penal action will be taken against the violators.

AURANGABAD: The local civic body in Jalna has started using mobile vans to collect throat swab samples for Covid-19 tests .

Jalna municipal council CEO Nitin Narvekar on Saturday said 36 areas of the city and the outskirts have been identified for the collection of swabs using the mobile vans.

“The vans are being used for collecting swabs of pregnant women and people aged above 60 years, as these people often face difficulties in reaching testing facilities,” he said.

Narvekar said the target groups would have to give their swab samples even if they are not showing Covid-19 symptoms. “We have initiated a health survey of around 70,000 homes within the city limits. Door-to-door visits are being made to screen citizens. Swabs are collected from the high-risk groups,” he said. The local authorities have set a daily target of 225 sample collection for testing.

Jalna district has reported -------- Covid-19 cases and ---- deaths by Saturday evening. ---- people have been cured.

Jalna still does not have Covid 19 testing facility of its own and swab samples are sent to Aurangabad and other places. A testing facility is being set up at Jalna and is slated for formal inauguration soon.

201,['12/07/2020'],Let us operate or stop private buses: RSRTC to 2 states,"An RSRTC bus stands next to a private one in city on Saturday

JAIPUR: Rajasthan State Roadways Transport Corporation (RSRTC) is yet to get nod from Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand counterparts to operate interstate buses. However, there is no bar on private buses to function. Therefore, RSRTC has asked its counterparts in two states to either allow its buses to run or stop private buses from plying.

Meanwhile, after getting nod from the Delhi government, the RSRTC will ply 45 buses from July 13. Moreover, private buses are not following the SOPs of social distancing and are also fleecing people. TOI on Thursday visited Polo Victory and Gopal Bari area from where private buses leave for Dehradun and Lucknow. Asked for the ticket to Delhi, a private bus operator said, “You need to pay Rs 650 per passenger and there is a possibility that you might be taken only up to Sarai Kaley Khan and near Rajiv Chowk in Gurugram.”

Meanwhile, the RSRTC authorities have been regularly calling up the authorities in Uttarakhand, Uttar Pradesh and Delhi and getting a clear cut no from their counterparts. “In this Covid-19 time, if they are not allowing us why are they allowing the private buses? Are they taking action against the private buses who are not following the SOPs. It seems to be a big nexus of the government officials and private bus operators,” said an office-bearer of the Rajasthan State Roadways Employees Union.

Naveen Jain, CMD, RSRTC, said, “We are in constant touch with officials of other states. I have heard that some private operators are plying their buses to these states. So, it is problematic for the passengers too as in absence of our buses these private operators must be fleecing the customers. Usually wherever our buses ply, private operators charge fare at par with us. But, they are only plying will give them a chance to fleece the customers.”

JAIPUR: More women in the state are adopting injectable contraceptives popularly known as Antara.

Compared to 88,000 injectable contraceptives used by women in 2018-19, the numbers rose to 99,496 in 2019-20. The health department released the figures on the occasion of World Population Day on Saturday.

“We have achieved 90% of the target of injectable contraceptives, which is quite satisfactory. We had set a target of 1,10 lakh women , but despite Covid, we achieved 90% of the target,” said Dr Girish Dwivedi, project director (family planning).

These are free of cost injectable contraceptives, which are safe but it may cause irregular bleeding initially in some women after the first dose, health department officials said.

Four doses of injections in equal intervals will prevent pregnancy for a year. Second dose is given three months after the first dose.

The government has introduced it as an option for spacing between two children without surgery. The methods for spacing are postpartum intrauterine devices (PPIUD) which needs minor surgery and pills which remain effective for a very short time.

The state will popularise Antara further in the next fortnight as the state will celebrate population stabilization fortnight from July 11 to July 24 in which the officials will encourage people to adopt family planning measures.

Rajasthan’s total fertility rate (TFR) is 2.5 and the state government is aiming to bring it down to 2.1 children per eligible couple.

TFR is the average number of children born to women during their reproductive years. Health minister Raghu Sharma said that population stabilisation is must to bring down TFR from 2.5 to 2.1.

While addressing a state-level programme on the occasion of World Population Day, he felicitated institutions and individuals who worked exceptionally well in population stabilization.

He said for popularizing family planning methods and other health and social schemes, they have identified swasthya mitras, one man and one woman, in every 41,645 revenue villages. All swasthya mitras will be completely trained till July 15. With the help of swasthya mitras, the state will move toward fulfilling Nirogi Rajasthan campaign.

Her father Vijay Kumar Sharma lives with in Gandhinagar village of Chhatarpur district — the district also infamous for skewed sex ratio.

Police said that Sharma’s second wife had given birth to a baby girl about two weeks. The baby was all hale and hearty, thus her sudden death raised suspicion among the villagers and police was informed.

Initial investigations have revealed that Sharma had taken the help of a quack from a nearby village for the delivery. He did not inform the local health authorities after the baby was born.

Investigating officer Maniram Gond, who was also present when the body was dug out from the dry water body, said, “ the post mortem report is awaited. We will take any action only after the report is out.”

Chhatarpur has 883 females against 1000 males — much less than the national sex ratio of 909 females against 1000 males. Last week, a woman had lodged complaint that her family ostracized after she gave birth to a baby girl.

The officials blamed exodus of migrant workers from the city during lockdown for lesser registration and claimed that they were still adding names to the list. Meanwhile, the officials are also planning for vending zones and for that designs and estimates are being prepared.

In June, the civic body officials had given time to the vendors for registration. As of now almost 8,500 vendors came for the registration while the survey that was conducted by the civic body had come out with a total 19,000 street vendors. In the past two months many migrants have returned to their homes during lockdown period due to which most of those who were identified during survey are not here. The officials claimed now they are taking help from the councillors for getting the vendors registered with the civic body. Only those vendors will be registered whose names are there in the survey list.

Zonal commissioner Neeraj Jain said, “The registration rate is low due to coronavirus and exodus of migrants from city. Many are coming back, so we have kept registration open for the vendors.” He said they had sent the proposal of establishing vending zones in the city to be tabled in the MC general house meeting, but the meeting had not been scheduled as of now.

Meanwhile, under Street Vendors Atam Nirbhar Scheme the street vendors will also get Rs 10,000 as loan amount to resume their business. This scheme has been introduced by the Union government for helping the street vendors whose business was disturbed during the pandemic. The vendors who will be registered with MC will be able to avail this loan at 7% interest rate. In this regard the civic officials also conducted a meeting with members of the town vending committee on Friday evening and they had been assured that vending zones would be established shortly.

The matter of vending zones has been hanging fire for a long time and even after conducting a survey around two years back the civic body officials could not finalise the vending zones.

Dean of Jalgaon GMCH Jaiprakash Ramanand told TOI that a total of 20 bed attendants have started working at the hospital a few days back.

Initially, in the first week of July, nine local residents had volunteered to work as bed attendants for Covid patients. Later, 11 more volunteered for the task.

“We conducted an orientation programme for all the 20 bed attendants explaining the ways to take care of themselves while working in the midst of affected patients. They have also been trained to deal with the patients,” said Ramanand.

According to Ramanand, the task of the bed attendants would be to provide bed pans to patients,serve meals to patients,escort them to and from toilets, etc. These bed attendants would be paid and they have been insured under the government’s medical insurance scheme, added Ramanand.

Jalgaon GMCH sources said that the attendants are a “boon” for the hospital. “There is a paucity of such attendants in the hospital. The doctors and the nurses are busy in treating patients. Therefore, these 20 attendants will assist patients in non-medical needs,” hospital sources added.

The Jalgaon GMCH, in the recent past, faced severe criticism following the recovery of the body of 82-year-old Covid-19 woman patient from the bathroom of the hospital ward. The incident took place in the second week of June. The woman went missing for five days before her body was recovered.

JAIPUR: It has always been a difficult task for chest specialists to diagnose Interstitial Lung Diseases (ILD), a group of 200 lung ailments. However, a guideline prepared by a SMS Hospital doctor in coordination with more than 40 doctors, including from AIIMS Delhi, will help in diagnosis and treatment of such patients.

Frontal Indian chest organisations — Indian Chest Society and National College of Chest Physicians (NCCP) — prepared the ILD guidelines which were endorsed by global thoracic bodies such as American Thoracic society and Asia Pacific Society of Respirology.

“ILD is a rapidly increasing disease in India. In ILD, lungs are so shrunken that they are unable to deliver oxygen to the body. Delay in treatment makes the disease irreversible and patient dies. Now, we have guidelines to diagnose patients early and treat interstitial lung disease,” said Dr Sheetu Singh, associate professor, SMS Medical College, who is the first author of the guidelines on ILD.

Other doctors who played a key role in preparing the guidelines are Dr Ganesh Raghu from USA and Dr Virendra Singh, who were co-chair of the guidelines. Other chest experts are S K Jindal, D Behera from PGI Chandigarh, Randeep Guleria, director, AIIMS Delhi, Jarir Udawadia, Beach Candy, Mumbai, Surya Kant, KGMC Lucknow, and Deepak Talwar and Rajadhar from Fortis Kolkata. These guidelines have been published simultaneously in two international journals Lung India and IJCDAS.

“ILD is a rapidly spreading disease and evidence-based guidelines will help respiratory physicians not only in India, but also globally. It has complete details, how certain investigations should be done to diagnose ILD accurately,” said Dr Virendra Singh, co-chair of the guidelines.

Some of the common ILDs are rheumatoid lung disease, IPF, sarcoidosis, silicosis and bird-induced HP in which normal lungs are shrunken and these fail to deliver oxygen to blood.

JAIPUR: It has been around five months since the completion of 3D drone survey for identifying heritage buildings that were altered without prior permission, but no action has been taken against the violators yet.

Around 1,200 buildings have been identified in the Walled City with altered façade, revealed a drone survey that started in October 2019 and ended in February 2020. Some have changed the external structure by using different shade of paint, altering the balcony to fix the AC duct, etc. Such owners of the building were supposed to be given notices.

On July 6, Jaipur Nagar Nigam, Heritage Conservation and Protection Bylaws, 2020, were notified and now the Municipal Corporation Jaipur , Heritage, will have authority to take action against the violators. According to Sec 12 of the Heritage bylaws, no development or redevelopment or additions/alterations, repairs, renovations shall be allowed except with the prior permission of competent authority.

This, however, will take time to be implemented as authorities are waiting for urban body elections to be over.

A senior JMC official on condition of anonymity said, “We have been waiting for the urban body elections to be completed as political body has more power to take action than the officials at JMC. But elections have been postponed due to the pandemic and there are chances of their further postponement. So, it is not possible to implement the survey report this year.”

This argument of the JMC officials does not stand as they are still capable of sending notices to the persons responsible for it. “Officials can send notices to the owners whose properties have been identified, but they are sitting on the survey report. One important issue is to remove encroachment and vote bank politics comes into play here. Hence, officials are waiting for the elections to get over,” said another JMC official on condition of anonymity.

211,['12/07/2020'],Two held in Gwalior for sheltering Vikas Dubey aides,"Cong leader Sajjan Singh Verma 'purifies' the Mahakaal temple route through which Vikas Dubey had entered

BHOPAL: The Uttar Pradesh special task force (STF) on Saturday arrested two persons – including the elder brother of slain Vikas Dubey aide Prem Prakash Pandey -- from Gwalior for allegedly harbouring two members of the gang after the murder of eight policemen in Kanpur on July 3.

Vikas, who was gunned down by UP cops on Friday morning near Kanpur, is believed to have had a strong connection with Gwalior and was once arrested in the city a decade ago. Two alleged members of his gang -- Sashikant Pandey alias Sonu and Shivam Dubey of Chaubepur area – had fled to Gwalior after the July 3 killings and hid here for four days, say sources. They were listed among 21 active members of the Vikas Dubey gang and carried bounties of Rs 50,000 each.

A team of UP STF had been camping in Gwalior since July 4 in search of Vikas and the other fugitives. Police say Gwalior residents Omprakash Pandey and Anil Pandey, who were arrested on Saturday, had allegedly sheltered Sonu and Shivam for four days before they moved to another place. Om Prakash is the elder brother of Prem Prakash Pandey, 55 who was killed in retaliatory firing after the Kanpur killings. Police claim he was a distant relative of Vikas and was alleged to be his accomplice in multiple crimes. Police say Prem Prakash had fired on police from Vikas’s terrace on July 3, and snatched rifles from wounded policemen. DSP Mishra was allegedly killed in Pandey’s home.While Prem Prakash was killed by police, his son Shashikant fled to Gwalior with Shivam and took shelter in his uncle’s home in Bhagat Singh Colony of Bahodapur area, say police, adding that he stayed here for four days before moving to a different hideout. Omprakash’s wife denied that Shashikant had stayed in their house during his flight. He told mediapersons that they have lived in Gwalior for more than 20 years. “My husband Omprakash works in a factory and is not involved in any criminal activity,” she said. Police said Om Prakash and Anil have been booked under IPC section 216.

Vikas’s bro-in-law freed

UP police have released Vikas’s brother-in-law Raju Khullar alias Gynendra Nigam and his son. Raju was Vikas’s friend from their school days but they fell apart. Raju and his wife said they had fled Kanpur 15 years ago to escape Vikas and had nothing to do with him. Raju was picked up by police on July 8. A police team dropped them home on Saturday morning. Raju said he was treated well by police in MP and UP.

214,['12/07/2020'],Villagers protest against NHAI for charging toll for ‘incomplete’ road,"Ludhiana: Several villagers from around Samrala lodged a protest against the NHAI on Saturday as it began toll collection on the Ludhiana-Chandigarh highway from Friday evening. The protesters also blocked the road for some time before the officials pacified them and assured that the matter would be brought to the notice of the higher authorities.

Locals said that a group of 100-150 persons from Samrala, surrounding villages, including Bijlipur, Ghulal, Chehlan, Sihala, Rupalon, Barma took part in the protest, which began at 11.30am for about one and a half hours. Various social group members were also supported the protesters.

Amarjeet Singh, a 63-year-old farmer from Balion village who was among the protesters, said that they were opposing collection of toll by the authorities as the road was still incomplete.

“They haven’t even constructed Neelon bridge and Bhaini Sahib flyover completely and even the bridge near Jatana village is incomplete, so how can they collect toll? Also the toll charge of Rs 55 is not reasonable. If a person starts from Chandigarh and has to go to Amritsar, he will have to pay toll at Kharar area, then near Ghulal and then at Phillaur and then at few tolls before entering Amritsar. This way it is heavy on the pocket of commuters,” said Amarjeet Singh. He added that they would continue to oppose the toll collection till the road was completed and would cause traffic jam on Monday as well.

Another protester Sandeep Singh said that the toll should be reasonable and that too after the road was fully constructed.

“We have the right to know about the investment made by the road construction and managing authorities and how much they will earn in a single day from it. They will need to make the toll reasonable and collect it after construction is complete,” he added.

Sanjok Singh, Samrala president of Lok Chetna Lehar Punjab, said that it was completely unjustified and was illegal to collect toll for an incomplete road. He rued that the road on either side of Samrala had not been completed.

“We will not allow them to collect toll before road construction is completed. We will hold a meeting on Sunday, wherein we will decide the future course of action,” said Sanjok Singh. “We will also meet the deputy commissioner and SDM against the move.”

Meanwhile, NHAI officials said that they were charging toll for the road they had completed. An NHAI officer asking not to be named said that they were charging toll for 69 km they had completed and the rate would be increased after the whole 76 km of road length was completed.

216,['12/07/2020'],Fraud siphons off Anyonya Co-op Bank’s recovered money,"Vadodara: Dues amounting to Rs 1.75 crore recovered from the borrowers of the now defunct Anonya Cooperative Bank Ltd was siphoned off from the Punjab National Bank (PNB) using forged documents by an unidentified person.

The scam came to light on June 24 when Anyonya bank’s manager went to PNB to get balance certificate of the dues that was kept as fixed deposit (FD). He was shocked to know that the amount of FD was pre-maturely withdrawn.

The manager informed Arjun Damor, liquidator of the bank appointed by the state government. Based on Damor’s complaint, offence of cheating, forgery and criminal conspiracy was registered by the Vadodara crime branch on Friday night.

According to police, the accused forged identity cards like PAN card and letters in name of Damor to transfer the FD to a bank account in Vadodara.

Police said that the accused first got a demand draft made on February 10 for Rs 1.75 crore. The demand draft was payable at Kolhapur. A week later the draft was cancelled and another demand draft payable at Vadodara was made. The accused opened a current account in name of Anyonya bank in Central Bank of India’s Karelibaug branch using forged documents and deposited the demand draft there.

On February 20, the accused transferred Rs 1.5 crore from the Central Bank of India account to an IDBI bank account in Mumbai held by Destiny Trading and invested the remaining Rs 25 lakh as fixed deposit in same bank. Later on March 5, the Rs 25 lakh FD was pre-maturely withdrawn and transferred to the account of RA Sales Corporation in Mumbai.

The crime branch has registered a case of forgery and cheating and is investigating into the fraud.

217,['12/07/2020'],Rajasthan: Rs 100 crore project to mitigate drinking water crisis,"Representative image

JAIPUR: In a bid to provide relief to three water scarcity-hit districts in the state—Pali, Sirohi and Jalore , the water resources department will expand the capacity of the tunnel that links Sei Dam with Jawai Dam in Pali for the supply of water to this dam.

The Rs 100-crore capacity-building project, which was announced by chief minister Ashok Gehlot in the budget, will help mitigate the acute drinking water crisis in the three districts.

In the current scenario, drinking water is transported to drought-hit Pali and other districts from Jodhpur via trains.

The tender process for capacity-building of the tunnel has been initiated with a sanctioned budget of Rs 15 crore for financial year 2020-21. This will lead to increase in the tunnel’s capacity from 34.13 million cubic feet per day to 73.87 million cubic feet.

“Over the years, it was observed that Jawai Dam (total capacity of which is 7327.50 million cubic feet) in Pali district was not getting filled to its capacity due to change in rainfall pattern and disturbance in the catchment area. Even though it is the most important dam in western Rajasthan, its deficit was increasing. However, it is the lifeline for these three districts as it provides drinking water to the people and the dam water is also used for irrigation purposes,” said Naveen Mahajan, secretary, water resources department. “Even as the capacity of Jawai Dam was huge, due to the disturbance in catchment area, the dam was not being filled to capacity, the rain water got wasted during monsoon as it travelled to Gujarat.”

“Later, we came up with an idea to rejuvenate the dam and fix the deficit. So, we decided to expand the capacity of the tunnel that links Jawai Dam with Sei Dam, which is a feeder dam of Jawai for supply of water. The capacity and size of the tunnel being relatively smaller, it had a limiting factor in terms of volume of water to be supplied to Jawai Dam. With the completion of the project, there will be no deficit in drinking water in these districts. It will take at least two years to complete it,” he added.

JAIPUR: The Directorate of Revenue Intelligence on Saturday conducted raids on the papad manufacturers at Bikaner and Jaipur and unearthed evasion of Rs 4 crore import duty .

With the hike in import duty, the manufacturers were importing one ingredient of papad from Afghanistan as the duty on products imported from Pakistan was 200%.

Sleuths said that Saji Khar is a type of salt used in making papad (snack) of Bikaner and is mainly produced in Pakistan.

“Prior to Pulwama attack, the manufacturers were getting Saji Khar from Pakistan with an import duty of 15%. However, post-Pulwama attack, the government of India increased the import duty on products from Pakistan to 200%. Thus, the manufacturers in Bikaner and Jaipur started getting the Pakistan manufactured Saji Khar via Afghanistan to evade import duty,” said a senior officer of DRI on the condition of anonymity.

On receiving specific inputs, the sleuths raided four importers based in Bikaner and Jaipur. “We unearthed an import duty evasion of Rs 4 crore out of which the importers agreed to pay Rs 1 crore,” said an officer.

“Some importers are importing it by the name of sodium bicarbonate at the rate of 7.5%. The documents of the importers were also checked to find any other nexus,” said an officer.

The authorities said that preliminary investigation suggested an estimated import duty evasion of Rs 4 crore which might further increase.

BHOPAL: Senior Congress leader Digvijaya Singh on Saturday took a dig at chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan and the BJP leadership for not being able to distribute portfolio to the council of ministers even more than a week after the cabinet expansion. He also claimed that Ashoknagar district is without a collector for 11 days because Jyotiraditya Scindia’s personal assistants have not yet found the right officer.

The former chief minister on Saturday tweeted, “It is eight days since the cabinet expansion took place. The chief minister’s work-out for department allocation seems unending. Has the tiger become toothless and clawless? Let us see who runs away from his territory.”

Digvijaya Singh was referring to the cabinet expansion last week in which 28 new ministers were sworn-in as part of the Shivraj Singh Chouhan government. Twelve of these ministers belong to the Jyotiraditya Scindia faction and were Congress MLAs who switched to the BJP in march this year. After the oath taking ceremony, Scindia dares veteran Congress leaders Kamal Nath and Digvijaya Singh claiming, “Tiger abhi zinda hai (tiger is still alive)”.

Incidentally, this same metaphor was used to describe himself at a public meeting by chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan in December 2018.

In second tweet, the Singh said, “Entire BJP from Delhi to Bhopal is trying to “work-out” the distribution of portfolios for the new MP ministers. This is not a fight over cabinet department distribution, rather it is the fight for plunder. Scindiaji (Jyotiraditya Scindia) would not want to leave departments like transport, excise, revenue, urban development. Why? You will know.”

Digvijaya also claimed that not just cabinet portfolios, even post of district collector Ashoknagar is vacant. “On June 30, the district collector retired from services, but Scindiaji is not getting the right officer who can pass the scrutiny of Prashantji and Parasharji (PAs personal assistants of Jyotiraditya Scindia),” @digvijaya_28 tweeted.

“Tiger Shivraj, don’t be so frightened ,” he added.

JAIPUR: The BJP is still playing the toppling game in Rajasthan, one that they played in Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh recently, said Rajasthan chief minister Ashok Gehlot here on Saturday and asserted that his government is stable and will complete its full term. Gehlot said his government has already begun preparations for winning the next assembly elections in 2023.Even as Gehlot brought charges against BJP, Rajasthan police’s Special Operations Group (SOG) on Saturday charged two persons with sedition and criminal conspiracy for trying to topple the state government by allegedly indulging in horse-trading of MLAs.The SOG claimed that it had intercepted phone conversation of the two while probing an arms deal case in June and found that they were talking about BJP’s alleged plans to topple the Gehlot government.According to officials, the accused discussed the alleged rift between Gehlot and his deputy Sachin Pilot as an opportunity for the BJP to lure Congress MLAs.“It was the nature of the conversation that led us to filing the FIR and arresting them,” said Ashok Rathore, ADG (SOG and ATS).Gehlot, who addressed a press conference, claimed that despite its best efforts to win over MLAs during the recently-held Rajya Sabha elections, the BJP was taught a lesson by the Congress in the state.Gehlot named three state BJP leaders -- leader of Opposition Gulab Chand Kataria, deputy leader of Opposition Rajendra Rathore and BJP state president Satish Poonia -- and claimed they were carrying out the agenda of the party’s central leadership.He said 14 MLAs were purchased in Gujarat ahead of the Rajya Sabha elections in 2017, and recently, seven MLAs had resigned for the saffron party to win two Rajya Sabha seats there.The BJP hit back at Gehlot, with Kataria challenging the CM to prove his charges or quit politics and also accusing him of scripting a political drama of horse trading against his own government to hide own failures in handling the Covid situation in the state. Poonia and Rathore demanded an inquiry into ‘elephant trading’ by the Congress that merged six BSP MLAs into its fold.",jaipur,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-76916769,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-296747,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/bjp-trying-to-topple-my-govtbut-it-is-stable-says-gehlot/articleshow/76916341.cms

232,['12/07/2020'],Students forced to defer plans to study abroad,"Chennai: Many college students in the city have had to put off their plans to study abroad this year due to the delay in conducting final year exams for engineering , commerce and science programmes.

Most foreign universities issue conditional admission letters and the students can join the courses only after submitting course completion certificates or marksheets. While the students have secured the provisional admissions, they cannot submit their degree completion certificates on time since the courses begin in September.

Institutions in the UK and France have announced that international students will be accepted for the September intake after undergoing 14 days quarantine.

Nikhil M S, a final year engineering student, has got admission letters from the University of Sheffield and Coventry University — both in the UK — for joining a MS programme in advance systems and controls in September 2020. Both the universities have deferred the offer as Nikhil could not submit proof of completing the UG degree. “I am not able to go to the UK because our semester exams have been pushed to September. The only option I have is to defer the joining date to September 2021 as there is no January intake for technical courses,” Nikhil said. Students planning to study further were not allowed to sit for placements in his college, he added. “I have to spend one year at home.”

Accepted for the MBA programme at Bangor University in the UK, Mishel Shelton J, a mechanical engineering student, was to begin classes in September 2020. “But there is no way I can submit course completion proof without writing the end semester exams. My IELTS exam has also been postponed four times. I have to defer my admission as I cannot get the final admission letter and visa without the course completion proof,” he said.

While the end semester exams were deferred for some, those who wrote the exams online also face issues. Venkateshwaran P, a final year BSc student from a deemed university in the city, got admission letter to do masters degree in international business at an institute abroad. “My college announced semester results based on model exams conducted online but I didn’t get any certificate of completion,” he said. He can apply for a visa until next month if he gets the certificate by then. “I am still hopeful. But due to the Covid-19 pandemic, getting an education loan is also becoming very difficult,” he added.

This has been the case with most students who had plans to study abroad this year, said R Sureshkumar, managing director of Truematics, an overseas education consultancy. He added that students who completed their courses last year alone plan to travel this year. “Universities offer only IT and management courses in January and engineering is available only for September intake. If not now, they have to wait for another year to fly abroad to study, particularly to the UK.”

233,['12/07/2020'],74% Chinese-owned Hyderabad pharma firm files for IPO,"HYDERABAD\MUMBAI: In what is one of the first Chinese majority owned companies to eye a listing on the Indian stock exchanges, Hyderabad-based Gland Pharma has filed a draft red herring prospectus (DRHP) with Sebi. The company wants to raise over Rs 1,250 crore through an initial public offering (IPO).

The DRHP filing comes less than a month after the Galwan Valley clash between Indian and Chinese troops left 20 Indian soldiers dead and resulted in the Indian government banning 59 Chinese apps.

In addition to the fresh issue of shares, the promoters plan to offer up to 3.48 crore shares to the public, including 1.93 crore shares held by Fosun Pharma, up to a little over 1 crore shares held by Gland Celsus Bio Chemicals, 35 lakh shares by Empower Discretionary Trust and 18.74 lakh shares by Nilay Discretionary Trust.

The fresh issue and the offer for sale together is expected to take the IPO size to around Rs 3,000 crore, sources said, adding that post-offer the public shareholding in the firm is expected to be about 25%. Gland Pharma plans to use the proceeds of the IPO to fund its incremental working capital, capital expenditure needs, and for general corporate purposes.

Chinese pharma giant Fosun Pharma (Shanghai Fosun Pharmaceutical Group) holds 74% stake in Gland through Fosun Singapore. Fosun Pharma’s acquisition of Gland Pharma in October 2017 was the single largest Chinese investment in India at around $1.1 billion when it was made.

Initially, Fosun wanted to acquire a little over 86% stake in Gland but was forced to scale it down to 74% after the Indian government flagged concerns over proprietary technology developed by the Indian firm going into the hands of a Chinese pharma company.

This happened in August 2017 when India and China were locked in a border standoff at Doklam. The investment proposal was recommended to the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs by the erstwhile Foreign Investment Promotion Board (FIPB) in April 2017.

Monoclonal antibodies can be a deterrent against Covid-19.Another anti-inflammatory, widely available for treatment of asthma and COPD, is the steroid, Dexamethasone . There have been reports of people stocking up the tablet form of the drug. Doctors are warning people against self-medication and it could have unintended consequences in case of a real infection.Tocilizumab, also known as Atlizumab, is an immunosuppressive drug, mainly for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis, a severe form of arthritis in children.

The court has fixed July 30 for hearing of the case.

Fifty-eight people had died and over 70 were injured after a train had run over a crowd of Dussehra revellers that spilled onto railway tracks while watching the burning of Ravana effigy at Jaura Phatak.

Principle investigator of Punjab Human Rights Organizaion (PHRO), Sarabjit Singh Verka said the seven persons against whom GRP had filed charges in a court included Mithu, Rahul Kalyan, Deepak Kumar, Karan Bhandari, Kabal Singh, Deepak Gupta and Bhupinder Singh. Verka has taken up the case of accident victims at various platforms.

GRP had registered a case against unidentified persons on October 19, 2018 and constituted a special investigation team (SIT) headed by assistant inspector general Daljit Singh Rana to probe the matter.

Retired judge Amarjit Singh Katari, who has also conducted a probe into this accident, had recently held five employees of Amritsar municipal corporation guilty and summoned them to appear before him on August 26.

Earlier two different investigations were done in the case, one by chief commissioner (railway safety) S K Pathak and another by Jalandhar divisional commissioner B Purushartha. Purushartha had submitted a 300 page report with government.

Meanwhile, a local resident, Deepak Kumar, who lost his father and uncle in the accident, said that all investigation reports were shifting responsibility. “Now, GRP has presented a challan in the court against some persons but many are still roaming free,” he said. “Even the government has not fulfilled its promise of giving job to one member of the victim’s family or monthly ration,” he added.

240,['12/07/2020'],Leopard that killed 2 children shot dead in Chamoli,"DEHRADUN: After 10 days of rigorous combing operations by three shooters and other forest officials, a leopard that had killed two children was shot dead in Chamoli district on Friday night.

The seven-year-old leopard was declared as ‘dangerous to human life’ after it killed a four-year-old boy in Bhayada Malethi village and a 11-year-old girl in Gairbam village of Narayanbagarh forest range in Chamoli district on June 29 and May 29 respectively.

The big cat was shot dead when it returned to the spot of its second kill on Friday night. Chamoli divisional forest officer ( DFO ) Ashutosh Singh said, “The leopard, which had killed both the children, was identified by its pugmarks. The villages of both the victims are aerially less than 2 km apart. It was finally shot dead by shooter Joy Hukkil when it revisited Gairbaum village, just 100 metres away from its second kill.”

According to sources, this is the third leopard to be shot in the state since January while six have been declared as ‘dangerous to human life’.

Meanwhile, forest officials are on the lookout for two more leopards in Almora and Nainital that have killed three persons each.

Sources said that the big cat in Almora had killed three persons since April and a ‘red alert’ has been issued to villagers in Bhasiyachana block where it is currently active. They added that shooters from Nainital and Bijnor have been deployed in the area to trace the animal. Almora DFO Mahatim Yadav said, “Our preliminary investigation by camera traps, pugmark analysis and combing of the forests has revealed that these deaths were caused by a single leopard. We have issued a 12-point advisory to villagers to remain alert.”

Similarly, in Nainital district , forest officials are planning to deploy shooters to locate the big cat which has killed three persons. Nainital DFO Bijulal said, “We have received an approval from the authorities concerned to either catch or kill the animal. We are going to deploy shooters in the vulnerable zones along with intensive patrolling and camera-trapping.”

Notably, as many as 12 people have been killed by leopards in the state this year.

241,['12/07/2020'],Apply for PG courses online by Jul 16,"Panaji: The admission process for postgraduate programmes at Goa University and affiliated colleges for 2020-21 will be held online, the university said on Saturday. The Goa University Admissions Ranking Test ( GU-ART ) Round I and II were conducted earlier this year and based on this, the admissions have begun, with the GU portal already accepting admission forms. The university has said that applications for admission will be accepted online till 6pm on July 16 and has asked students not to visit the campus.

“Based on the GU-ART Round-I and Round-II, selected candidates have confirmed their seats as per their rankings for various programmes,” GU said.

Admissions to the PG programmes are based entirely on GU-ART and marks obtained by students at graduation will only be used to ascertain their eligibility for the programme, the university said. As the final year exams for graduate programmes in the state are yet to be conducted due to the lockdown , the university has reiterated that ‘candidates who have completed their graduation or are in their final year of graduation are eligible to apply’ for PG seats.

As of now, the final year graduation exams are set to be conducted from the first week of August in colleges.

“Selected candidates, who are in the final year of graduation, shall be granted provisional admission. Their admission will be confirmed after the results are declared based on the eligibility. In case a candidate fails to clear the graduation examination, the admission shall be cancelled and the fees shall be refunded,” the circular states.

The university said that in their own interest, students are advised to apply for admissions much before the closing date and ‘not to wait till the last date for applying or payment of application fee to avoid possibility of disconnection, inability or failure to log on to the website as there might be heavy load on the internet or website’.

“Goa University does not assume any responsibility for the candidates not being able to submit their application within the last date on account of aforesaid reasons or for any other reason beyond the control of Goa University. The printout of the application form is not to be sent to the university,” the circular states.

The Nashik Municipal Corporation (NMC) had started the work of laying the stormwater drainage system that will draw the water from the higher areas in the city and drain it into the Godavari river in order to prevent flooding.

“We agitated at the worksite which had been shut down by some people on Friday. We want the NMC to immediately restart the work to prevent waterlogging,” said Chetan Rajapurkar, an office-bearer of the goldsmith association.

The topography of the area is such that the shops and old wadas constructed along the banks and the slope of the Godavari river have to deal with stormwater gushing down the road towards the river. “We are aware of the problems and can prepare for them when the Godavari is actually in spate and the water level rises in the river. However, even in the early days of monsoon, when the water level in the river is low, heavy rainfall can cause stormwater gushing down the streets to enter our shops and cause major damages,” said Shankar Patil, one of the traders, said.

This is the fourth-year such waterlogging is taking place in this area at the beginning of the monsoon. Therefore, the local traders have requested immediate measures.

District guardian minister Chhagan Bhujbal had visited the shops and establishments who have faced huge losses twice during this rainy season. The NMC has taken up the task to construct another stormwater drain which will draw most of the water underground directly to the river and give respite to the traders in the area.

“We only want the construction to be completed at the earliest. If the work does not restart by Monday, we will sit on an indefinite agitation from Tuesday,” Haresh Patel, another trader, said.

244,['12/07/2020'],Experts feel loud talking at TVM market spurred cases,"Thiruvananthapuram: Kumarichantha , which is assumed as the origin of multiple clusters in three coastal wards in the capital, may have set off the transmission chain with a potent combo of crowding and loud speech, said infectious disease experts.Large transmission clusters – reported recently in Washington, South Korea – emerged from high-risk settings where people shouted or sang; ascertaining studies which showed that oral fluid droplets released during normal and loud speech in crowded environment transmitted the virus. A good percentage of persons who tested positive in the three coastal wards had direct contact with the market and became positive more or less in the same timeline.Coronavirus super spreading events in South Korea and Washington had its origin in choir meetings. “Kumarichantha being a crowded market, people talk in high-pitched voice, while trying to sell stuff. This is equivalent to a choir in terms of generating aerosols like the incident in Washington or South Korea. It could be the case of small particle aerosol transmission. It was not a case of super spreader but a super spreading event that is unravelling in coastal wards,” said an infectious disease expert associated with Covid management in state. While airborne transmission is mostly associated with confined environments, lack of social distancing, negligence in using masks coupled with crowding and high pitched speech would have made matters different in Kumarichantha, officials said.An article published in Nature magazine on relation between aerosol emission, super emission, human speech and voice loudness mentioned how a fraction of individuals behave as speech super emitters when they release more particles than their peers. The study showed that smaller particles emitted during breathing and talking are less noticeable but arguably more-infectious because despite their small size, they are sufficiently large to carry a variety of respiratory pathogens.Officials said that it is not just the case of Kumarichantha; crowds in places which are highly-vulnerable, especially markets, could be potentially-risky for widespread transmission.“In many cases , people could be asymptomatic, so we can’t lookout just for persons who sneeze or cough. Silent carriers could also emit oral fluids with viral load during normal speech and when they talk loudly in a high-risk setting, the danger is amplified. It strongly emphasizes the need for constant use of masks which could ward off the possibilities of large-scale transmission,” said an official.A recent study published in the journal National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America shows that speech droplets generated by asymptomatic carriers of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) are increasingly considered to be a likely mode of disease transmission. Highly sensitive laser light scattering observations revealed that loud speech can emit thousands of oral fluid droplets per second, the study noted.",kochi,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-47529300,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-110164,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/experts-feel-loud-talking-at-tvm-market-spurred-cases/articleshow/76915348.cms

NASHIK: The district combating the Covid pandemic has at least been spared a dengue outbreak so far. Senior officials of the district malaria department said dengue is in under control across Nashik district.

In the past two months, there were just about eight cases of dengue across the district, officials of the malaria department said. They added that this year, till June-end, there were only 96 cases of dengue in the district.

Last year, the health department had found 1,443 positive dengue cases, while two deaths were also reported.

A year before that, there were 1,031 positive cases of dengue and four people had died from it.

Officials added that this year, maximum dengue cases were recorded in the month of January. Since then, there have been very few cases reported in the urban and rural areas.

The district malaria department took up a drive to spread awareness about dengue last month. Ashas and health workers made house-to-house visits to check if there was any patient suffering from dengue and if people were storing water properly. Awareness was also spread among people to acquaint them with the causes of dengue.

Dengue fever is a severe, flu-like illness that affects infants, young children and adults. Dengue should be suspected when a high fever is accompanied by at least two of the following symptoms - severe headache, pain behind the eyes, muscle and joint pains, nausea, vomiting, swollen glands or rash. Symptoms usually last for up to 2 to 7 days, after an incubation period of 4 to 10 days after the bite from an infected mosquito, said the health officials.

248,['12/07/2020'],Spike in population puts pressure on civic infrastructure in Indore,"INDORE: As World Population Day was observed on Saturday, Indore city has witnessed a growth of around 4.5 lakh voters in its 85 wards while there is an expected growth of total 10 lakh residents in the last five years. The same has created a huge pressure on basic civic amenities and infrastructures including water supply , drainage line and traffic.

According to state election commission’s first voters’ list published ahead of upcoming civic body polls, there are 20.89 lakh voters in IMC’s limit while in 2015, there were a total around 16.50 lakh electors in all 85 wards of city. In 2015, the city’s population was around 22 lakh and after five years, the same has reached to 32 lakh. While IMC is working to increase basic amenities and infrastructures as directed under Masterplan 2021, the same is stated to be inadequate to cater the increased population.

There are many wards including Chandan Nagar, Sirpur, Bijasan, Nandbagh, Sant Kabir, Gouri Nagar, Swargiya Rajesh Joshi, Shahid Bhagat Singh, Nipaniya, Saikripa, Nahar Shahvali, Mundla Nayata and Sukhniwas, where upto 100 per cent growth of voters, and total population in same comparison, has reported in last five years.

“The Master Plan 2021 was meant to cater expected population of 35 lakh in around 505 square kilometer areas but IMC has taken only 278 square kilometer area to develop basic amenities and infrastructures while population density in the said area has increased at a rapid speed and has reached to the count of around 32 lakh” social worker Kishore Kodwani told TOI.

He added that as a result, Indore city is facing traffic-jams, drinking water shortage and drainage problem as major issues on a daily basis.

According to IMC Commissioner Pratibha Paal, IMC is on the verge of completing phase 1 of AMRUT (Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation, which focuses to establish infrastructure that could ensure adequate robust sewage networks and water supply for urban transformation by implementing urban revival projects).

“In second phase of the project, we are including the increased area and population of the city to create required civic amenities and infrastructures to meet growing demands of water supply and drainage system” she said. The commissioner added that while IMC is already working on widening of roads to ease traffic movement, IMC will decide its roadmap to make further developments to cater the population on the basis of next Masterplan Year 2035.

Among the state’s robust child-welfare networks there is a deafening silence, as the government’s number just doesn’t tally with their own.In a state where every unusual death involving a child is discussed threadbare in all circles, including news and social media, the number has left most flummoxed, unable to counter for want of better data and unable to accept that one child died every two days in the last 108 days in the state!Official sources say most of the deaths were among children in their late teens between 16 and 18 years of age. They stress that the number also includes attempted suicides.However, renowned psychiatrist Dr C J John refutes the claim, saying that since suicide has been decriminalized attempted suicides need not be reported. “It is not mandatory for hospitals to report them. If we go by the data put out by the chief minister, then the frequency of suicides works out to roughly one death every two days. It was not flagged by any agency government or NGO. We didn’t have any such reports in the media even though death by suicide is generally reported. This also, when several other deaths were discussed on public platforms and the media. The government’s figure does not tally with the known number of suicides,” said Dr John, who also works with Maithri – an NGO working on preventing suicides.Dr John said that for better understanding it is important that details be made available to policy planners, which should include professionals and experts.“If one were to look at the psychosocial support (PSS) data, around 64,286 calls were made by counsellors and 10,299 children were given counselling. The data shows stress (3,084), anxiety (2,905), behavioural issues (311) but only seven calls suggesting suicidal behaviour. Tools must be devised to reach out to children. The ‘Chiri’ project – which employs student police cadets (SPC) for primary-level intervention is ridiculous. You are asking a child to counsel another child. Do they have the maturity or training to handle it? At best, they can function as a peer group,” Dr John said.State officials admit the number is very disturbing. “We were discussing a few suicides that had happened when we asked the police for data. However, the increase in suicides among children below 18 is not a new pattern. There have been reports by Childline and Unicef flagging the issue. In the last nearly one-and-a-half years there have been about 300 such suicides reported in the state,” T V Anupama, director, women and child department.The social justice, women and child development department and the state mental health authority will analyze the cases to understand and work out a policy for prevention and intervention.",kochi,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-76917083,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-483480,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/experts-question-kerala-governments-data-as-officials-flag-rising-trend/articleshow/76915351.cms

INDORE: Shri Govindram Seksaria Institute of Technology and Science (SGSITS) is likely to become the first autonomous college of Madhya Pradesh to start virtual laboratory.

The college has been recording experiments in both English and Hindi.

“We have begun with formation of experiments for our virtual lab . We have started with the first year and we have been shooting audio videos of all experiments. We will be uploading it on website and they will make use of these experiments,” director of SGSITS Dr RK Saxena told TOI.

The students will be able to access all experiments and in case of queries, they will be able to float the question and faculty members involved will resolve the queries which will be open for all registered students, he added.

Lab assistant will be performing the experiments and the student will experience that through the website. Registered students will have to login and will get the access of all the experiments.

The autonomous institute is also in the process of making use of government platform of virtual laboratory. After getting the NIRF ranking, SGSITS has become eligible as all the requirements are now fulfilled and is in process of applying at ministry of MHRD’s Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) for virtual lab too.

After getting the nod, SGSITS will be able to avail the facilities of virtual experiments of IIT Hyderabad , IIT Delhi , IIT Bombay and NIT Kurkshetra and many other institutions as these institutions will be able to give their access to the college.

The college is in the process of training the associate professor and assistant professors so as to ensure that they are capable of handling the virtual laboratory.

“Engineering is a discipline in which hands on training of the practicals are of utmost importance. As students cannot come to the college to do practicals, this virtual lab portal of the government will be beneficial for the students,” said nodal centre coordinator of virtual lab, Urjita Thakar.

The matter came to light after the victim’s husband approached the ACB with a complaint in this regard. The victim is a primary teacher at a zilla parishad Urdu school in Chandwad.

In his statement, the complainant told ACB officials that the suspect had demanded money for approving revised salary document of his wife.

The complainant said that the revised salary document of his wife was applicable from December 2019. However, she did not get it. Upon enquiring about the same, he was told that the signatures of the official concerned in his wife’s service book was necessary. When the complainant approached the official for the same, he was asked to pay a sum of Rs 15,000.

258,['12/07/2020'],Kerala govt plans to augment ICU facilities,"KOCHI: Increasing number of cluster cases and possible surge in the number of patients who require intensive care has forced the state government to augment facilities in intensive care units (ICUs) in 10 medical colleges in the state.For catering to the needs of Covid-19 patients, ICU facilities will have to be changed considering the specific requirement of patients.The state government is planning to augment the facilities in the medical colleges in Thiruvananthapuram, Kollam, Alappuzha, Kottayam, Idukki, Ernakulam, Thrissur, Manjeri, Kozhikode and Kannur.“The decision to augment facilities in the ICUs was taken at a meeting convened by health minister K K Shailaja and attended by health secretary Rajan Khobragade and national health mission state mission director Rathan Kelkar the other day. We are preparing a proposal in this regard,” said director of medical education Remla Beevi A.“Once the facilities are improved, the ICUs will be useful for handling non-Covid cases in the future as well,” she said.The government has authorized Dr S S Santhosh Kumar, deputy superintendent, Thiruvananthapuram Medical College, for preparing a detailed report on augmenting the facilities in ICUs.“All the ICUs will be negative pressure units. This will help reduce the ICU-borne infections,” said Dr Kumar.Another major change which will be introduced in the ICUs is ensuring an undisrupted oxygen supply system.“Covid patients in ICUs require large quantity of oxygen. So, supply of oxygen through cylinders won’t be enough. There requires a pipeline system which provides oxygen at every bedside. Tanks for storage of oxygen and pipeline for its distribution will have to be arranged,” Kumar said.There should be at least 100 standardized ICU beds for Covid patients in every medical colleges. A total of 1,000 such ICU beds should be arranged in the state.In major medical colleges like Thiruvananthapuram, Kottayam, Thrissur and Kozhikode, there should be scalable facilities. Efforts should be made for providing at least 200 more standardized ICU beds in these colleges. While a tank for storage of oxygen will be suffix for other medical colleges, the major medical colleges which are expected to witness heavy flow of Covid-19 patients require at least two oxygen storage tanks. Other facilities in those medical colleges should be scalable. Tender procedures for scaling the facilities in major medical colleges should be readied in advance.",kochi,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-76919882,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-77519,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/govt-plans-to-augment-icu-facilities/articleshow/76915360.cms
259,['12/07/2020'],Red stickers now for suspected nCov cases too,"VMC decided to identify suspected cases through door-to-door survey

Vadodara: With a view to isolate persons who could be infected by Covid-19 and have not been tested, the Vadodara Municipal Corporation (VMC) has decided to categorise such persons as ‘Suspected Covid-19’ cases. Much like stickers or posters declaring houses as home quarantined or contained, the civic body will also put up red stickers on the houses of suspected cases stating ‘Suspected Covid-19’.

The decision to identify suspected cases and isolate them was taken as a part of the massive survey by the civic body as part of the door-to-door surveillance and through the Dhanvantari Raths. A series of acute respiratory illness cases of patients with flu-like symptoms have been identified during the drive by the VMC.

Sources said that the cases are then referred to a medical officer who decided on the course of action to be taken. If the medical officer sees a possibility of Covid-19 infection, the person is asked to go into self-isolation and the sticker declaring him as a suspected Covid-19 case is pasted.

According to officials, the proactive strategy of surveys and isolation of probable cases was taken up instead of waiting for a person to come to hospitals or clinics with a possible Covid-19 infection. Officials have been concerned about patients arriving at hospitals too late making their treatment a challenge.

While the VMC officials were not able to arrive at the exact number of such suspected cases, sources said that these included 57 cases identified with severe acute respiratory illnesses in the red zone of the city as well as many from around 1,500 acute respiratory illness and fever cases identified during surveillance using the Dhanvantari Rath. The civic body has rolled out 17 such mobile units that examine people. So far, 19,971 persons have been examined in the city.

Sources said that a similar drive had been taken up in the rural areas of the district outside VMC limits. Here too stickers will be put up outside homes of suspected Covid-19 cases.

The pandemic changed the life of Hriday Pai, who was all set to move to Canada and begin work there. Forced to stay back, and with his textile store closed, he decided to launch an organic outlet ‘My Brand ’.Hriday was feeling low when he realized that his Canada plan may not materialise.His father Annu Mangalore said, “I told Hriday to work on a proposal. Along with other fruits and vegetables, we decided to brand jackfruit based on the colour—red, orange , and yellow—and to our surprise, the demand for red is high, and since the outlet’s launch on June 1, we have managed to sell about 10 tonnes of jackfruit. We also do doorstep delivery of ready-to-eat jackfruit bulbs that are hygienically packed, for which the demand is increasing.” Annu said that he plans to open 9 more stores by the end of this year. The fruit is sourced from Doddaballapur and Tumakuru.Chandramouli Shenoy, proprietor, MVS Fruits, said, “I am a third generation fruit trader, and after an interaction with experts at ‘Halasu Mela,’ before the pandemic, I decided to introduce jackfruit at my store for the first time, two months ago. After the produce arrived, I shared it on WhatsApp, and to my surprise, I received nearly 100 calls. People wait for the stocks to arrive. People’s awareness about the fruit is also increasing,” he said. Shenoy has managed to sell 9 tonnes of jackfruit.Mangaluru’s success in selling jackfruit during the Covid-19 crisis is a clear indication that there is a good demand for fruits, provided they are served hygienically. Probably, for the first time, doorstep delivery of jackfruit or only bulbs has been taken up, said Shree Padre, global ambassador for jackfruit in India. “The Gowd Saraswat Brahmin factor has worked for Mangaluru. The community is always on the lookout for quality fruit. There is a latent demand for jackfruit in urban areas, and unfortunately, so far, there was no effort to procure the jackfruit being sold on the footpath, and sell it from a clean and decent shop. Time has also come for an exclusive outlets that sell jackfruit in the form of the whole fruit, pre-packed, value-added products with a longer shelf life as well as a counter that will serve jackfruit preparations such as a smoothies, milkshakes, pedas, ice-creams, and other products,” he added.",mangaluru,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-76914686,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-55555,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/amid-pandemic-there-is-a-growing-demand-for-jackfruit/articleshow/76914688.cms

263,['12/07/2020'],Incessant rain in region triggers fears of flood in Krishna basin,"Inflow to the Almatti Dam in Vijayapura district has spiked owing to continuous rain in the region

BELAGAVI: Heavy spells of rain have rapidly increased the inflow of water to Almatti dam in Vijayapura district, prompting the authorities to alert the field officers to monitor the situation as the threat of floods looms large over people living close to the Krishna basin .

In just three days, the inflow has jumped from 26,000 cusecs to 73,971 cusecs, while the outflow stood at 21,130 cusecs on Saturday. Normally, the dam receives over 70,000 cusecs in the first or second week of August. Heavy rain is lashing the hinterland of Karnataka-Maharashtra borders since a week, especially in the catchment areas, thereby increasing the water levels in Krishna river .

The people of Holemasutti, Yallammann, Bhudihal, Kasinkunte, Yalagur and other villages in Bagalkot and Vijayapura districts are now under the fear of yet another flood . However according to the authorities, the current inflow is not that worrying. But to be on the safer side, they have been asked to be vigilant and monitor the situation.

The increase in water flow to over 2 lakh cusecs is a threat. In 2019, the dam saw up to 6 lakh cusecs washing away livelihoods of many people in north Karnataka. Sidram Kurabet, a villager from Yalagur said: “In 2019, the dam got 70,000 cusecs inflow in August. This is a cause for concern and we have been informed to be on alert by Karihna Bhagya Jala Nigama Ltd (KBJNL). The people have been living in fear after hearing the rapid increase of inflow.”

KBJNL chief engineer R P Kulkarni said that there is no threat at present as inflow is well below the danger level. “But we have informed gram panchayats and other ground-level officers to be on high alert,” he said, adding that KBJNL, having the experience of handling the floods in 2019, is doing everything to tackle the floods. Rain subsided on Saturday, and inflow too is not increasing as it did in the previous days, he said.

Ashok Chandaragi, activist and who helped thousands during floods, said this is the time for the government to closely monitor and manage water flow to thwart flood-like situations. “Amidst corona, Karnataka is not ready to face another tragedy,” he said.

KOLKATA: The Kolkata Municipal Corporation (KMC) and Kolkata Police have decided to put emphasis on slums and mixed zones to contain the spread of coronavirus after reports of multiple violations reached them on Saturday. While police will take help of technology and manpower to clamp a total lockdown on slums, the KMC teams have decided to visit all affected apartments in the quickest possible time to carry out necessary tests.In its efforts for an effective lockdown, Lalbazar will also use drones and CCTV cameras in certain pockets. Cop presence on roads leading to the effected zones has been increased too. On Saturday, several cars that tried to enter Bijoygarh and Garcha Road were prosecuted and people defying lockdown were threatened with legal consequences.Containment zones in Kankurgachhi, Ultadanga and Bhowanipore will be under special watch. “These are our main focus areas not only because of high numbers recorded in the past two weeks, but also due to the area’s highly dense and mixed population. That includes a number of senior citizens. The initial data collection from these pockets has shown that there are multiple ILI and SARI patients who are prone to Covid,” said a KMC health official. For now, the strategy is four-pronged — more swab testing (especially the neighbours of affected zones), collection of medical history, emphasis on safety measures and ensuring that senior citizens and kids are provided maximum protection.The city police commissioner, too, hinted at a holistic approach. “To be successful, just blocking roads with barricades is not enough. People are moving around. Together with KMC and other government agencies, we are teaming with NGOs and penetrating the slums and apartments. Awareness announcements are also on,” said commissioner Anuj Sharma.In some of city’s worst containment zones the ward coordinators are reaching out to elderly persons with the help of civic volunteers. In Bijoygarh, local ward coordinator Debabrata Majumdar has been leading a drive to take medicines and other essentials to elderly citizens. In Ultadanga, the local coordinator distributed food for the second day.In at least two containment zones of Bijoygarh and Sakherbazar, KMC arranged for special announcements after false reports that dozens were getting infected.

KOLKATA: In a rerun of the 2014 murder of Bamangachhi’s anti-hooch crusader Sourav Chowdhury, a college student was gunned down by criminals in Titagarh on Friday night for raising voice against the activities of a local gangster.

Three armed goons led by gangster Arif Iqbal alias Chottu arrived in motorcycles and allegedly fired five to six rounds at the victim Toufik Ali (21) in front of his house in Titagarh’s Uranapara. Ali had protested against the gang’s anti-social activities in the locality. Police on Saturday arrested Chottu and his aide Suraj Ali. Another accused is at large. The duo has been remanded in police custody for ten days after production in a Barrackpore court.

Police suspect that row over a movement launched by the victim against local criminals could have led to the murder.

Locals said Ali, a second year BA student from Barrackpore Rastraguru Surendranath College, used to protest against anti-social activities in his locality and drew the ire of Chottu, a Sodepur-Titagarh based criminal. “Trouble broke out a couple of years ago when Chottu and his aides started committing crimes. Besides extortion, they used to operate several satta-gambling dens in Titagarh. They even consumed alcohol in public and made obscene gestures at girls. It was Ali who had had first raised his voice and organised a protest,” said Moharchand Ahmed , a local trader.

Sources said Chottu, who was wanted in some others crimes, had fled to the Gulf to evade arrest after committing twin robberies. “Chottu returned barely six months ago and began operating a gang in Titagarh. The members on motorbikes used to roam the area till late at night creating ruckus,” a local cable operator said.

On Friday night, while Ali was on his way back home on his two-wheeler, he found the bike gang creating ruckus in the locality. He protested and tried to stop them. “My braveheart brother asked them to leave the spot. But the trio whipped out their guns and fired at him before fleeing the spot. The goons pumped four bullets into Ali’s chest and one into his back. Ali then slumped to the ground, bleeding profusely,” said Nausad Alam, Ali’s cousin. The victim was rushed to Barrackpore BN Bose hospital where he was declared brought dead.

Police later raided a slum areas near Titagarh’s Brambhasthan and arrested Chottu and Suraj from a hideout. “We have already arrested two with a firearm and are looking for another accused. Though the motive behind the murder couldn’t be ascertained, primarily we suspect that the miscreants fired during a heated argument,” said Barrackpore police commissionerate DCP (central) Amandeep.

269,['12/07/2020'],Kolkata: Lake morning walkers beat a retreat as snakes slither out,"KOLKATA: Sighting of snakes has scared morning walkers at Rabindra Sarobar with many deciding not to venture into the grounds till the overgrowth was cleaned up, making the reptiles retreat into burrows.

A regular at the Lake , emission expert Soumendra Mohan Ghosh, who lives on Sarat Bose Road, recently resumed his walks following the reopening of Rabindra Sarobar. But he has again stopped going to the Lake, ever since he spotted two large snakes there. “I believe the snakes were Russel’s Viper, locally known as Chandrabora, one of the most dangerous species around. As the grounds were closed for three months during the lockdown, nature regenerated and wildlife had reclaimed their space. Now that Rabindra Sarobar has reopened for three hours a day and people are back there, the snakes will retreat. But till that time, I have decided not to go there and risk an encounter with one,” Ghosh said. He claimed to have seen a nearly 15ft-long snake near Calcutta Rowing Club and alerted others. “We waited for the snake to slither across the road and disappear into the overgrowth,” he recounted.

Another morning walker saw two intertwined snakes — perhaps in the act of mating — near the joggers’ track along the water edge. Other walkers reported sighting snake skins. Snakes shed their skin to allow for their growth and remove parasites that may have attached to the old skin.

Sumita Banerjee, a pro-environment crusader at the Lake, said fear of snakes had led to a sharp drop in the number of morning walkers at Rabindra Sarobar. “I haven’t seen a snake yet but others have said they have spotted them. Prior to the Lake’s opening, regular cleaning of the grounds and cutting of overgrowth had stopped after the Amphan cyclone,” she said. “It is natural for snakes to emerge when Rabindra Sarobar was shut. Now that it has reopened, I am sure the reptiles will return to their hideouts. I think a bigger hazard than the snakes are those who are out on walks without masks. Many senior citizens have stopped coming, fearing virus spread.”

A KMDA official acknowledged hearing about snakes being sighted at the Lake. Pointing out it could have been due to the large number of trees being uprooted in the cyclone, he said, “Snakes and rats burrow under trees. When the trees were uprooted, their habitat was exposed and they emerged from there as there was no human activity around. We will clean the Lake in the next 10 days. Once the overgrowth is managed, snakes will return to their hideouts.”

270,['12/07/2020'],"Attributing cause of death to Covid sans other tests is unscientific, says forensic science prof","Nagpur: Sevagram’s Mahatma Gandhi Institute of Medical Sciences’ (MGIMS) forensic medicine professor Dr Indrajit Khandekar, whose PILs have helped shape five medical policies, has initiated a new debate over attributing the cause of death to a single tested virus — Covid-19 — without investigating other viruses that cause lakhs of deaths per year.

Dr Khandekar said the method is unscientific as studies have already proved that in people who are suspected to die from viral respiratory pathogens, more than one virus and bacteria are often found causing death.

“Does testing only for Covid mean that all other viruses and bacteria that are causing lakhs of death have vanished due to the appearance of this new virus?” he wrote in his blog. As per doctors at government hospitals, rarely has a Covid-19 victim been found not suffering from other ailments too.

“A positive test for coronavirus does not necessarily mean that this virus is always primarily responsible for a patient’s death. As we are not testing for other viruses, all other respiratory infection deaths appear to be labelled under Covid deaths. In addition to this, the WHO has asked the authorities to give cause of death as “clinically Covid” even if lab tests are negative or inconclusive. This is inflating the numbers of Covid deaths and is misleading the public about the actual number of deaths caused by the virus,” he said.

Citing an government-sponsored 2019 study published in the Lancet, Dr Khandekar said, “If the natural death numbers per year are not changing, then there is no need to worry,” he said.

Dr Meena Mishra, professor and Head of Department of Microbiology at AIIMS, Nagpur, said because we don’t have an exact answer to death due to respiratory diseases taking place amid the pandemic, it is important to investigate further. “We have started multiplex filmarray, a state-of-the-art technology which helps detect 22 pathogens in a single cycle. It was observed that many SARI patients were testing negative. So, it was crucial to know the cause.”

Asked about Dr Khandekar’s blog, Dr Mishra said, “It is quite valid. Flu season has started and there are concerns if other respiratory viruses apart from Covid have resurfaced. This latest test aids us in monitoring different types of corona viruses, other respiratory viruses and some atypical bacteria like chlamydia, mycoplasma pneumonias, haemophilus influenza etc,” she said.

271,['12/07/2020'],MUHS gets lukewarm response for home district exam centre option,"NASHIK: A paltry 5.52% of the nearly 9,500 final year undergraduate health science students in the state have opted to appear for their summer exams from their home districts.

The final year UG exams in various courses like allopathy, dental, ayurveda, nursing, unani, etc. are starting from August 4.

Last month, the Maharashtra University of Health Sciences ( MUHS ) had given the option for the final year UG students to write their exams at centres in their home districts so that they need not travel to their own colleges located in other districts in view of Covid-19 pandemic.

All health science colleges in the state have closed down due to Covid-19 and the students residing in hostels have now gone to their respective home towns in other districts.

Interestingly, the varsity came up with this option for the maiden time as a section of the students raised issues about travelling to other districts for exams.

This home district option is not available for postgraduate students whose exams have been scheduled from August 25.

“We did not receive encouraging response from final year students about writing exams from centres in home districts. They have write the papers from their own colleges” admitted MUHS sources.

The varsity’s controller of examination Ajit Pathak told TOI that final year UG students cannot opt for the home district option as the deadline is over. But students of first, second and third year of different undergraduate health science courses can apply for the same till July 14 as their exams start from August 17.

“The university has appealed to the students of these classes to opt for home district exam centre in large numbers. We have made this option for their own convenience,” added Pathak.

273,['12/07/2020'],State CID to probe firing case on mayor Joshi,"Nagpur Munciple corporation Sandip Joshi brief Press confrence at NMC in Nagpur on March 04th 2020

Nagpur: The undetected case of life bid on the incumbent mayor Sandip Joshi in the midnight of December 18 last year by armed goons has been transferred to state criminal investigation department (CID) by the state director general of police (DGP).

Joshi had received two threatening letters following which three rounds were fired on his car on the outer ring road. He and his friend, who were in the car, were saved by a whisker. As per source, the detailed documents and records of the case have been transferred from Nagpur police crime branch to the state CID.

An offence of attempt to life was registered at Beltarodi police station against unidentified persons. It’s learnt that two bikers had opened fire on Joshi’s car before fleeing from the place. CP BK Upadhyay had shifted the probe to crime branch for focused attention on the case.

SP, state CID, Rajlaxmi Shivankar, confirming the development, said the investigating agency is in the process of finalizing a course of action. “We have received the case papers and other details but need to scrutinize them,” she said.

“We would form a team to probe the case but the other details are yet to be finalized,” she said. Shivankar assured to render best efforts to do justice to the crucial case.

Mayor Joshi too welcomed the development but also gave thumbs up to the city police efforts. “The efforts under DCP, crime, Gajanan Rajmane to unravel the case is appreciable. Addl CP Nilesh Bharne was confident in cracking it too but lockdown had de-railed the entire investigation process,” said Joshi. “The pandemic had compelled the cops to re-orient their priorities from crime prevention and detection to some other types of responsibilities,” said the Mayor.

City police had questioned more than 1,000 suspects in the case including several having past records of the Arms Act. The cops also had proposed for brain-mapping of two suspects but they were denied.

SONARPUR: A woman and her septuagenarian foster father from Subhash Gram, Sonarpur, were stabbed to death at their residence on Saturday. The husband of the woman went missing after the incident.

The bodies of the duo were first noticed by a neighbour on Saturday morning when she came to the house to pluck flowers. The neighbour told cops that she first noticed the body of Basudeb Ganguly (76) in the bedroom. Suspecting something amiss, she went closer and found the blood-spattered body of the woman — Sumita Pandit (38) — in the balcony. She raised an alarm and the police were called in. Sumita’s husband Ramesh Pandit (43) was missing and his mother and their four-year-old son were at a neighbour’s house.

Police noticed that the victims were brutally stabbed. There were multiple wounds on their throats and other parts of their bodies. The genitals of the man were mutilated.

According to locals, Ramesh had decided to bring his mother to his in-law’s house a few years ago. A book-binder, Basudeb was finding it difficult to run the family. Ramesh did some odd jobs, but did not contribute to the family’s expenditure. On Friday night, Ramesh and Sumita had a heated argument, neighbours said. Ramesh’s mother took her grandson to a neighbour’s house when he started to beat up Sumita. “Ramesh suspected that Sumita’s father was trying to evict them from the house while Basudeb suspected that Ramesh wanted to usurp his property,” a neighbour said.

Baruipur SP Rashidmunir Khan said that Ramesh’s mother was questioned and her statements offered some clarity. “We are trying to track Ramesh,” Khan said.

NEW DELHI: Till now a site that gave around 5,000 daily visitors a glimpse of iconic global structures , the Waste to Wonder Park at Sarai Kale Khan might well become a favoured location for birthday parties and corporate events , perhaps even a pre-wedding shoot. South Delhi Municipal Corporation has cleared a proposal to rent demarcated space at the park for such social gatherings.

Officials of SDMC’s horticulture department said the reserved space overlooked by architectural wonders like Paris’ Eiffel Tower, Giza’s looming pyramid, New York’s Statue of Liberty and India’s own Taj Mahal could accommodate up to a hundred individuals. Bookings, however, will open only after the disruption caused by the Covid pandemic normalises.

The pathway with a separate entry leading to this special area will be so designed as to ensure general visitors cannot access it. Only one site will be provided for social gatherings, but the civic body hopes to expand on the project later. “There are spaces within the park that are not being used at present. This project will optimise utilisation of space and provide a unique setting for events,” an official said.

An SDMC official revealed, “For corporate events, the space will be available for Rs 25,000 for six hours, but for birthdays and other parties, the charge will be around Rs 10,000 for four hours. The fee for pre- or post-wedding shoots will be Rs 15,000 for four hours.”

The Waste to Wonder Park is closed since March 17 in view of the social distancing requirements. Inaugurated in February last year, the park features replicas of seven easily recognised structures from across the world — including the Leaning Tower of Pisa, Christ the Redeemer statue of Rio de Janeiro and the Colosseum of Rome — all built of 150 tonnes of industrial waste and scrap metal.

278,['12/07/2020'],Govt orders low-key Ganeshotsav this year,"Nagpur: The state home department has asked Ganeshotsav mandals to tone down their celebrations this year due to Covid-19. The height of the idol has been limited to four feet, and no processions will be allowed. Devotees will have to maintain Covid distancing in the premises.

Local mandals have agreed to abide by the guidelines, acknowledging that some restrictions were necessary in view of the pandemic.

As per the guidelines issued by home department, the height of the idol for community celebrations can only be up to 4 feet, while for household celebrations it must not be more than 2 feet.

Processions should not be taken out while installing and immersing the idol. Senior citizens and kids should not be present during the two functions.

People should use marble or metal idols so that they do not have to be immersed. If that is not possible, the idol should be immersed at home or at nearby artificial immersion tanks. People should try to keep the idol at home till Maghi Ganeshotsav or the next Ganesh festival (in 2021), and immerse the idol at that time. This will avoid crowd formation at the time of immersion.

Mandals should not erect advertisements that attract crowds. They should display social and health messages on signboards. They should hold blood donation camps and programmes to create awareness about Covid-19, malaria, dengue etc, and about general hygiene. Organizers will have to ensure that there is no crowding during aartis, bhajans and kirtans. Sound pollution norms must be followed.

Mandals should make arrangements for virtual darshan of the idol through websites, Facebook, cable television etc. They should try to encourage devotees not to come to the pandal for darshan.

Pandal should be frequently sanitized and devotees should be thermally screened before entering the pandal. The devotees should maintain Covid distancing.

Congress leader Munna Jaiswal, who organizes Ganeshotsav in Dhantoli, said that he would abide by all the guidelines. “We will install an idol of 4 feet height. People should cooperate with the government during such times,” he told TOI.

BJP MLC Pravin Datke also said he would abide by all guidelines, and appealed to others to follow suit. “We will hold health awareness programmes during the festival through virtual media. We will educate parents about online education of their kids. People who have lost their livelihoods due to the lockdown will be guided about self-employment. Most of the money collected for the festival will be donated to the government for Covid relief. I appeal to others to do the same,” Datke said.

THE GUIDELINES

Height of mandal idol to be max 4 feet, household idol 2 feet

No procession during installation of idol. Same for immersion

Try not to immerse idol immediately. Should be done on auspicious occasions later

Arrange for virtual darshan of idol using technology

Hold health awareness programmes

Covid distancing, thermal screening, sanitization etc must be ensured

If the price rise of perishable items has been sharp, that of semi-perishable items, like potato, which can be hoarded easily, has been even steeper.The price of Jyoti, a common variety of potato produced in abundance and consumed widely in Bengal, rose to Rs 28 a kg on Saturday, though even a week and a half ago, it sold for Rs 22 a kg. This was because a section of traders had been hoarding huge stocks, hoping for a windfall in case of further rise of potato prices, said a trader from Hooghly.Buyers have been even more shocked when it came to buying other vegetables, such as, tomato, brinjal and bitter gourd. Before Amphan hit Bengal, tomato sold for Rs 20-24/kg but it cost Rs 70-75 a kg on Saturday. Parwal or pointed gourd, which used to cost Rs 25-30 a kilo, was sold for Rs 50-60 a kg.“Transportation cost has increased manifold because of expensive diesel rates and lack of local trains. Earlier 90% vegetables was transported by train. Ferrying the essentials by road costs five times more. Secondly, a section of middlemen, who has now become active, is raising prices,” said Kamal Dey, member of Market Task Force . Moreover, containment zones in the neighbouring districts, which produce the bulk of vegetables, have been cut off from the city. “Vegetable growers there are being forced to sell their produces at local markets. The supply line issue has widened demand-supply gap. Rain in north Bengal has also cut off the supply of some vegetables,” he said.Dilip Madal, who sells vegetables at Lake Market, rued the drop in the number of middle-class buyers. “They are either not visiting or buying much less than usual. With a lot of vegetables remaining unsold, some of us are being forced to lower the rates.”Chicken prices has been higher than usual, said Bikram Dhali, a chicken seller at Gariahat Market.

Inquiries revealed that Kamal Babu’s parents were retired SBI employees and the boy used to frequent the bank branches where his parents worked.His attempts to get a job in the bank on compassionate grounds after his father’s death in 2007 turned futile as he was a minor then. His mother, too, was in service in SBI.Panruti inspector Ambedkar said the teen claimed to have sent an email to the SBI headquarters pleading for a job on compassionate grounds and the bank rejected citing he was a minor.

“Rathod was found sitting by the roadside on Thursday. We picked her up in the police control room van. She appeared to be homeless and seemed to have lost her address,” said an official from Rajkot B division police station.

Initially, she said she had come from Ahmedabad and had lost her way. Then she said she had a relative in Gundavadi. “We went to Gundavadi and found Paresh Tank, who is Rathod’s nephew. Tank came to the police station and ascertained the identity of Rathod. He said Rathod lived alone in Yoginagar locality of Gondal,” said the official.

284,['12/07/2020'],Covid fear in public transport spurs used vehicle sales,"NAGPUR: The ongoing restrictions on public transport and people’s apprehension about using it upon resumption has not just spurred sales of used cars and bikes, but has also led to price rise in Nagpur. Both, two-wheeler and four-wheeler associations are experiencing an increased demand, especially from people living in the city outskirts.In their interactions with customers, auto dealers at the city’s Chitra Talkies Square-located Bearing Market — which is said to be Vidarbha’s hub for used vehicles — have found that buyers do not wish to use public transport, out of fear of getting infected with Covid-19.The two-wheeler association has reported a 60-70% increase in demand after the Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) allowed opening of non-essential shops on alternate days in the first week of June.The association secretary Sheikh Mehboob said fewer used two-wheelers were available in the city currently, because people were not buying new vehicles, and hence not letting go of their old ones.The trend is yet to reflect in Regional Transport Office (RTO) records. As per RTO data, just 52 transfer of ownerships were recorded for June, as compared to 543 in June 2019.Associations said that while purchasing vehicles was an urgency for many, buyers were in no rush to get them transferred in their names, which is the reason why RTO was yet to record the pattern.Anil Gohne (51), a resident of Kanolibara in Hingna taluka, had been relying on state transport (ST) buses to commute to Nagpur for the last 25 years. Gohne runs a garage and also has a small farmland. “I need to travel twice a week to Nagpur, about 35 kms from here. I feel it will be risky when the ST bus service resumes. New vehicles are unaffordable right now so I went for a used one,” he said.Gohne said he was short of money to complete the ownership transfer, and had put if off for a later date.Prasheel Shridhar Doifode, a resident of Trimurti Nagar , bought a scooterette bike for his sister. “She works in an IT company and used to take an auto to get there. There is no guarantee that the auto drivers will follow norms, so we immediately purchased our own vehicle,” he said.Auto dealer Abdul Aqueel, who is the former secretary of Vehicle Brokers’ Association, found the rush for vehicles a consequence of panic to fulfil basic needs. “We were surprised too. Most of our customers said they were buying to avoid public transport,” he said.Aqueel said people were not selling their vehicles as new vehicles were costly, and new technology (BS-VI) is high on maintenance.Atul Chotai, secretary of Nagpur Vehicle Brokers’ Association, said the sales were not as high now as they were in February, but most buyers were people who used to rely on public transport. “From 2000 cars a month, sales crashed to 200. Buyers are government officials, traders and professionals who wanted their own transport,” he said.",nagpur,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-47529300,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-110164,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/covid-fear-in-public-transport-spurs-used-vehicle-sales/articleshow/76915418.cms

QUEPEM: With uprooted trees, stumps and other remains being deposited at the foot of Pansaimoll rock carvings due to the swollen Kushawati river, locals fear the 9,000-year-old invaluable artwork of Pirla village in Sanguem may be lost forever.

Before the onset of monsoon, a huge tree came crashing down near the site. Before it could be removed, another tree debris came along with the flow and remained stuck at the same site.

Discovered on May 8, 1993, these carvings on a laterite stone in Pansaimoll have put Goa on the rock art map of India. Though in a remote place, it has been attracting students, tourists and researchers from far and wide.

Vithal Khandeparker, a retired agriculture officer and a Pansaimoll resident said, “The river flow has been partially blocked due to the debris of the two trees next to the rock art carvings.”

The site becomes fully accessible after the monsoon when the river bed dries up. Every year, however, the sludge has to be removed to expose the carvings.

“A huge retaining wall on the south side of the river bank has also collapsed,” Khandeparker said, adding, “Authorities have been informed about the tree debris and the likely damage it may cause to the carvings.”

Khandeparker told TOI that an official from the archaeology department informed him that a tender has been floated to clear the uprooted trees.

The rock carvings depict the symbol of a fertility cult, religious cosmology, triskelion, zoo-morphs like Zebu bull, deer, gaur, a scene of mating animals and large animals hooves.

286,['12/07/2020'],India ranks 8th among 10 Asia-Pacific countries in cancer preparedness: Report,"MUMBAI: Cancer continues to remain a health concern in the Asia-Pacific, with its incidence expected to increase by 35%, and mortality rising by nearly 40%, found a report by the Economist Intelligence Unit. Among the 10 countries examined for preparedness by the report, India ranks a low eighth.The report, sponsored by drug company Roche, examines cancer preparedness and complexities of disease challenge in 10 countries: Australia, China, India, Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, Philippines, South Korea, Thailand and Vietnam .Even as India continues to fight the Covid-19 pandemic, it is weak when it comes to cancer preparedness, with an overall score of 51.6 (out of 100), below the regional average of 66.5%, just above Vietnam and Philippines.Others in the ‘Index of Cancer Preparedness’, like Australia (92.4), South Korea (83.4) and Malaysia (80.3), lead the region. With the cancer burden in Asia-Pacific reaching an estimated 8.8 million cases in 2018, the Index looks at different responses to disease challenge, and essential elements needed to enhance preparedness in the region.While India is recognised for its progress in tobacco regulation, further progress can be made as the country records below-average scores across all three pillars in the Index: policy & planning, care delivery and health system , and governance, it adds.Dr CS Pramesh, director of Tata Memorial Hospital and coordinator for the National Cancer Grid, said, “I do agree that there is work to be done to improve overall access to cancer care and demonstrate cancer preparedness in India. However, I would take this report with a pinch of salt. Any score or index which summarizes a topic as vast as 'national cancer preparedness' to a single score is fraught with problems. Cancer preparedness or access is far too nuanced to be reduced to a number”.The EIU research adds that India faces challenges in developing comprehensive cancer control plans and expanding its immunisation and cancer screening programmes because of its vast population. Like other lower-middle-income countries, India should focus on closing persistent access gaps and ensuring quality of services across the cancer continuum through better infrastructure and service supply, while prioritising on a healthy lifestyle promotion.Further, the research found the obvious strong association between income level and overall cancer preparedness, that high-income countries with established healthcare infrastructure outperform upper-and lower-middle income countries. A strong correlation was also seen between the overall score in the Index and cancer control outcomes as measured by ratio of mortality to cancer incidence in countries. This demonstrates that, in broad terms, better preparedness to manage the cancer burden equates achieving better cancer outcomes.Given that as many as 70% of cancer cases in low and middle-income countries are diagnosed at a late stage, an emphasis on preventive services and moving from opportunistic to population-based screening is needed.",mumbai,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-76917692,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-251384,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/india-ranks-8th-among-10-asia-pacific-countries-in-cancer-preparedness-report/articleshow/76916362.cms

It has already deferred its Term End Examinations (TEE), which was scheduled to be held in July, with no new dates.

Some online students are tweeting with hashtag #Ignou and many are commenting on Ignou’s official handle, asking what the varsity has decided with regard to their examinations. An user, who went by the name Sona Singh Rajput, tweeted on the varsity’s page, “what about first year and second year students examinations. Why are you not responding”.

Tutor-marked assignments, which are integral part of evaluation in Ignou, saw their submission deadlines being extended multiple times. Without submission of these assignments, students cannot appear for the TEE. Due to the lockdown, Ignou gave an option of submitting the assignments online to its students. This is the first time ever such a step is taken, though it still has to be handwritten. In Ignou, some courses are offered in semester pattern while others are offered through the yearly pattern.

Regional director of Ignou, Nagpur, P Sivaswaroop said the university has already started working on concerns raised by students. “At Ignou, we have to consider the condition of entire country because our students are spread all over. A committee has been formed at our Delhi headquarter which is deliberating on the issue. We expect that a decision will soon be taken, following which my office will convey to all registered students,” said Sivaswaroop.

In addition, the action assumes more importance as there are widespread allegations of nepotism against several appointments in the IT department’s subsidiary organizations. “The IT department is being controlled by the chief minister’s office directly and M Sivasankar has been in charge of both. There are multiple ways of creation of the posts and appointing the preferred candidates in many such organizations,” government sources said.As per the order issued by Sivasankar on June 26 (GO (Ms) No 17/2020/ITD), accessed by STOI, other than the managing director, general manager, company secretary and chief financial officer, two posts of deputy general manager, two posts of managers, four posts of deputy managers, one post of estate manager, one post of deputy manager (finance) and two posts of assistant managers were created under permanent posts. This was done by abolishing the existing six sanctioned posts citing that they are grossly insufficient for the functioning of the company. Prior to the latest creation, there were 27 posts in the company, including six permanent posts.The 18 temporary posts include four posts of assistant managers, three posts each of deputy general managers, managers and deputy managers and one post each of administration assistant, junior accountant, junior office assistant, driver and house-keeping staff. The salaries of these posts have been fixed in the range from Rs 16, 500 to Rs 1,17,600, from the housekeeping assistant to the general manager, respectively, except that of the managing director. The salary of the MD has been left to the government to fix and revise from time to time. The salaries for the newly created posts alone would approximately amount to at least Rs 2 crore every year.As per the order, the method of appointments to these posts are through either direct recruitment or through deputation and through temporary appointments on the basis of project requirement.",thiruvananthapuram,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-76917054,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-70661,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/ex-it-secy-created-34-posts-in-ksitl/articleshow/76915442.cms

AMC teams conducted an inspection in areas affected with waterlogging after the rain on Wednesday which choked nullahs on both sides of the Agra-Delhi highway in city limits.

During the ongoing six-laning project of the Agra-Delhi national highway, drainage system was developed by the NHAI on both sides of the highway in the city limit. However, the drainage construction is yet to be completed.

After the rain on Wednesday, areas along the national highway, including Sultanganj-Ki-Puliya, DVVNL head office, water works crossings etc witnessed heavy waterlogging due to choked nullahs.

Municipal commissioner Arun Prakash said, “A notice has been issued to the project manager of NHAI for the shoddy cleaning work done on both sides of the highway. Besides, the construction of drainage system which has not been completed yet is causing water-logging on roads and colonies near the highway. NHAI has been asked to take time-bound action to ensure the nearby areas do not suffer from waterlogging again.”

Meanwhile, AMC has established suction pumps at 22 places in the city to clear the water which is posing to be a problem for the locals. These 22 places lack drainage system and waterlogging usually takes place after rain.

NOIDA: Eleven-year-old Dheeraj (name changed) had to drop out of school four years ago to take care of his siblings — now aged six and four years. His father, an e-rickshaw driver, and mother, who works at homes, work hard so that the family can have two square meals.

When the lockdown came into force in March, Dheeraj’s father couldn’t take his vehicle out and the Sector 100 society where his mother worked closed its doors to domestic staff. The young boy , who never had a normal childhood, has had to start selling vegetables to try and plug the income void.

This is the plight of not just Dheeraj but several others like him. Childline India officials said that they have received around 17 calls related to children taking up jobs in Noida, Dankaur and Greater Noida between March and June.

Satya Prakash, manager of FXB-India Suraksha that takes care of the helpline in Noida, told TOI that nine such calls were received in March, while two calls were received in May and six in June. “Prior to the lockdown, one or two such cases were reported but now we are receiving calls in bulk,” he said.

Dheeraj’s mother said letting him sell vegetables was the family’s last resort. “He had scored 80% in his Class II exam and wanted to study further. But if he went to school, who would have taken care of his siblings? Also, with the lockdown, I lost my cooking job that would fetch me Rs 12,000,” she said, adding they are yet to pay rent for June and July. The boy has been selling vegetables in Hajipur area but his mother has stopped him from working now as there weren’t enough earnings.

On June 15, TOI had reported about another 13-year-old boy who was forced to sell fruits during lockdown.

In a similar case, hunger pangs forced an eight-year-old boy to drop out from the government school that he was studying in and take up shoe polishing. The boy was later rescued by Childline officials from Greater Noida’s Kasna area and his parents were also counselled. His parents had said that since they ran out of money after losing jobs, the boy was asked to earn.

In yet another incident, a 14-year-old boy from Faridabad was sent to Tugalpur in Greater Noida before the lockdown to stay with his sister. However, the minor boy’s brother-in-law made him work in his photo studio for months. When Childline got to know of the incident, they intervened and the boy was produced before the child welfare committee and sent to his home in Faridabad.

Mala Bhandari, president of NGO Sadrag, which handles Childline’s Greater Noida helpline, said, “Undoubtedly, there has been an increase in the number of calls received pertaining to child labour during the lockdown months. There have also been cases in which parents have asked their children to work as they couldn’t earn anything.” The lockdown, she added, has been a testing time for all.

The teenager was produced before the child welfare committee (CWC) on Friday following which a counselling session of her was conducted to ensure she overcomes the dilemma. It’s learnt that the girl was lured by her beau to marry him.

The family of the girl had prepared a fake Aadhaar card revealing her age as 19. The wedding cards were also distributed. As the preparation for the marriage was underway, NGO Childline got an alert call from the locality.

The activists of Childline, working under the umbrella organization of Indian centre for integrated development (ICID), informed the district child protection officer Mushtaq Pathan and district child and women development officer Aparna Kolhe who swung into action. Juni Kamptee police too were alerted about the developments.

ICID’s office bearer Chhaya Gurav, working under Father Herald D’Souza, said her team, along with police and other government officials, reached the place to meet the girl’s family. “Suspecting that the Aadhaar card was fake, we ensured the records of the Anganwadi, where the girl studied, was checked. It came to fore that she was supposed to turn 15 in December,” said Gurav.

The family members were made to sign a declaration that they would refrain from engaging in such illegal act of child marriage and immediately put a stop to the undergoing preparation. “We have also summoned the man who was planning to marry the teenager half his age. He would be also made to furnish in writing not to repeat such an illegal act,” said Gurav.

She also said that CWC and other government agencies, including NGO Childline activists, shall keep a close watch on the families and on the teenager.

NEW DELHI: Jayshree Shukla isn’t your everyday heritage enthusiast . While she captures the daily street life of Emperor Shah Jahan’s capital on camera, she also tries to live it as much as possible. Last year, she even fasted on Ramzan along with Muslims and broke them at Jama Masjid .

For being such a connoisseur who has “created understanding and awareness about Muslims”, Shukla has been honoured by Delhi Minorities Commission with its annual award in the Communal Harmony category for 2019.

“Being a history graduate, I was always interested in documenting heritage. But I was mostly doing it in Lodhi Garden. I didn’t know much about the Walled City. But one day about five or six years ago, I decided to join a heritage walk in Old Delhi. And my journey of discovery started from there,” reminisced the 52-year-old St Stephen’s alumna, who comes from an upper-caste Hindu family.

But during that first journey, somebody stole her purse right outside Sunehri Masjid — the place where Iranian invader Nader Shah had ordered a general massacre of Delhi’s populace in 1739. But she was back there after nearly four months. “I had gone there like foreign tourists do, carrying all my ID cards in the bag, too. I should have been careful,” Shukla said.

She started documenting the street life, old homes, snaky alleys — everything that makes Purani Dilli so alluring. “Then I went to Jama Masjid during Ramzan and I was captivated. There was so much life, so much colour in the markets around the mosque! I would be clicking photos there and nobody would object. In fact, someone or the other would come and hand me a date, which is used to break the fast.”

But she started fasting only last year. “The election results were announced during Ramzan. We started building walls around us, and I felt we need to build bridges. So, I started fasting along with the Muslims.” This year, she fasted only on the first and the last day of the holy month.

Her partners in this exploration journey are her husband Raju Srivastav and driver Mohammed. Srivastav even organised an iftar at his ancestral home in Dinkarpur village, about 70km from Ayodhya. “There is no tradition of Hindu families hosting iftar for Muslims there. Some people were initially hesitant, but eventually everyone joined,” Shukla said.

Mohammed helps her understand things she cannot experience herself like eating beef niharis and kebabs. “I don’t eat beef. Mohammed tastes them and tells me the difference,” Shukla said, pointing out that documenting food was an important part of a heritage enthusiast’s work.

Historian and author Rana Safvi swore by Shukla’s commitment to preserving Ganga-Jamuni tehzeeb. “Jayshree and Raju embody the India that I was born in, the India whose image I cling to, and the India which I want to die in,” Safvi said.

VIJAYAWADA: A 21-year-old degree second year student killed herself after taking a selfie video at her residence in Bhaktavatsala Nagar, Nellore town on Saturday. The video, which went viral on social media, shows the woman with a scarf tied around her neck pleading an unidentified man named as ‘Shiva’ to talk to her.

The video was then sent to three men pleading them to talk to her for at least five minutes. According to Nellore town police, her family members found her hanging at her room. Upon information, cops reached the spot for investigation.

Police said that they had found messages being sent to three different men pleading them to talk to her. After there was no response, she sent the video to them, threatening to end her, though the men didn’t reply. The messages sought a man named Shiva alias Bharghav to talk to her. With no reply, she eventually hanged herself. Meanwhile, her parents told the cops that she was being harassed by the youth.

Cops said that they are tracing the youngsters who are currently absconding and suspect that a love affair could be the reason behind the extreme measure.

The police also ascertained that the three men that the victim messaged to weren’t studying in the same college and were friends from outside. A case under Section 174 of CrPC (suspicious death) was registered by the police and the body was sent to Nellore government hospital for post-mortem. Further investigation is on.

They point out that the infection can spike again if more people aren’t screened and those with symptoms isolated.The Greater Chennai Corporation and state health department say they test between 9,000 and 10,000 people a day. But what has dropped is the number of people being screened for symptoms. On June 30, for instance, 34,880 people were screened at 537 fever camps and the swab samples of 2,536 were tested. But on July 10, just 2,745 people were screened at 498 camps and 1,508 were tested.“Good fever surveillance will help us keep active cases low for a fortnight. If we do that, we will be able to flatten the epidemic curve,” said former city health officer Dr P Kuganandam. “The number has come down because people have started going to work and aren’t at home,” said a health worker, who has been assigned to visit at least 100 houses in Virugambakkam, where a fever camp was organised on Saturday. “Even during the door-to-door survey we only ask if everyone in the family is healthy. We don’t record the temperature of every member of the family anymore,” she said.With the reduction in screening and testing at the fever camps, several zones have reported a drastic drop in the positivity rate . Officials at Zone 4 in Tondiarpet said 8% of people in the zone tested in camps were positive on July 8 compared to 15% on June 30.“Drop in positivity rate is a good sign only when the testing numbers and targets don’t change. Reduction in symptomatic people indicates that we could be missing out on potential cases. We can’t drop our guard now,” said National Institute of Epidemiology deputy director Dr Prabhdeep Kaur.The sudden drop in positive cases in the last few days can be misleading. Chennai, which reported 2,393 cases on June 30, reported 1,205 cases on Friday and 1,185 cases on Saturday.“There should be more screening of people in camps now than before,” said senior general practitioner Dr T N Ravishankar of Sundar Hospitals. With change in weather, infectious diseases experts say there is a spike in the number of people with cold, sore throat and fever. “Many people are out of their homes, and hence there is more chance of infection. Only a test can rule out Covid-19,” he said.Chennai Corporation joint commissioner (health) Madhusudhan Reddy said the civic agency was planning to conduct fever camps in commercial and industrial areas. “These are mobile camps that can go anywhere. We are drawing up a schedule to ramp up testing at fever clinics,” he said.",chennai,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-76916965,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-295897,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/chennai-case-count-falling-so-are-tests-at-fever-camps/articleshow/76916366.cms

296,['12/07/2020'],"Delhi: Wife kills man for objecting to affair, four held","Representative Image

NEW DELHI: A tattoo and fresh leaves on an unidentified body helped the cops solve the murder of a man who was allegedly killed by his wife and her lover in south Delhi’s Maidangarhi area recently. The daughter of the deceased and one of her friends — both minors — were also involved in the crime.

Police said the deceased, who was aware of the illicit affair, would often beat his wife and their daughter after getting drunk.

According to police, a call was received on July 2 about a man’s body lying in a drain at Mahabalipuram. A tattoo with initials ‘ST’ was found on his arm. Since the body was covered with fresh leaves, the cops got a hint that the man was murdered elsewhere.

“A car was found abandoned a kilometre away from the drain. On the basis of the registration papers, the body was identified as that of Mahender. He was also known as Sanjay Tanwar in the area. The deceased’s family was informed and the body’s postmortem conducted,” said Atul Kumar Thakur, DCP, South.

Mahender’s wife, her lover Manoj, Mahender’s 16-year-old daughter and her female friend were identified as accused.

The wife later told the cops that the deceased objected to her relationship with Manoj. “Often the couple would have fights and the deceased would thrash her. Mahender even objected to their daughter having feelings for another female classmate who helped in the murder and has now been apprehended,” an officer privy to the investigation said.

The wife and his daughter subsequently planned the murder and roped in their partners. On June 30, when Mahender was drunk, they strangled him using a dupatta. All the four accused then put his body in the car and dumped it in the drain.

The Delhi Commission for Women had also asked Mathura police on Thursday to submit an action taken report. The girl had been travelling from Delhi to Shikohabad with her mother on June 15 when she was forced off the bus. She died 30 minutes later and the postmortem report attributed it to a ""cardiac arrest"".On Saturday, Mathura SP (Rural) Shirish Chandra told TOI that an FIR has been registered under section 304 (culpable homicide not amounting to murder) of the IPC against the bus conductor on the basis of a complaint submitted by the girl’s mother at Maant police station. “The mother has alleged that it was the conductor who forced them off the bus. We will also investigate the role of drivers.” The bus had two drivers because it was on a long-distance route.Earlier, the Uttar Pradesh State Road Transport Corporation (UPSRTC) had also ordered an inquiry into what led to the death of the girl and recorded the statements of the two drivers and conductor Brijpal Singh.UPSRTC regional manager (Agra) Manoj K Pundhir said the inquiry was “delayed” since it took time to identify and trace who was on duty that day. “We have also found that the actual route of the bus was Agra to Jhansi and back. It was not scheduled to go to Shikohabad where the girl and her mother were headed.

KOLKATA: South Eastern Railway ( SER ) has started using drones and sniffer dogs to secure its assets and installations. Though only a few special trains for passengers are running during the lockdown, a large quantity of freight continues to be carried across the country. Also, parcel specials are also being run. To maintain the movement, it has become crucial to provide security along the network.

“RPF personnel have been working 24x7 to secure assets. This has proven to be a difficult task during the lockdown when movement has been severely restricted. It was decided to utilize all assets, including drones and sniffer dogs, as force multipliers across the network in Bengal, Odisha and Jharkhand. The drones have helped reduce the need for physical surveillance , while sniffer dogs are ensuring there is no sabotage attempt,” said Sanjoy Ghosh, CPRO, SER.

According to Ghosh, the drones are maintaining vigil on yard signalling infrastructures, wagon stocks, goods sheds and station relay rooms among others. The drone cameras are providing clear images within a 2-km radius both during the day and at night, when operated from a certain height. Sniffer dogs are not only checking for explosives but successfully keeping miscreants from railway property.

300,['12/07/2020'],PM Narendra Modi hails united efforts in Delhi’s Covid fight,"NEW DELHI: The success of concerted efforts and close coordination among the Centre , state government and corporations in bringing the Covid situation in Delhi under control points to the need to ensure swifter cooperation so that information does not remain sealed in silos and improves the Centre’s ability to share real time information with states, a high-level review held by PM Narendra Modi concluded.The Centre seems set to broaden its engagement with the states as the discussion on Saturday saw senior ministers and officials concluding that if coordination between the Centre and states could bring about a significant improvement in the situation in Delhi, it can work elsewhere. Feedback received by the Centre also showed that various authorities were often working in silos and this needs to change in order to quicken the response of the Centre and state agencies in identifying hotspots.Modi hailed measures taken by the Centre, state government and the local authorities in containing the Covid-19 in Delhi and tweeted that “priority is close monitoring and guiding the containment works in regions where the infection rate is high”. It is understood that the emphasis will remain on testing, which is approaching the 3 lakh a day mark, and reducing incidence and fatalities. The Centre feels a target of bringing fatalities under 1% should be set and all states work towards this objective.The effort to increase engagement with the states will be coordinated by the cabinet secretariat and the home ministry. The meeting was attended by Home Minister Amit Shah, Health Minister Harsh Vardhan, members of NITI Aayog and other senior officials. An official statement said the PM has asked for real-time national-level monitoring and guidance to be provided to all affected states and places with high test positivity rates.The community outreach model in Ahmedabad, called Dhanvantri Rath, was seen to have been effective. It involves seeking out persons with symptoms, supplying medicines and immunity boosters and follow-ups to see if there has been any deterioration. “The PM appreciated the concerted efforts of the Centre, state and local authorities in containing the pandemic situation in Delhi,” the statement said.“He further directed that a similar approach should be adopted with other state governments in containing the Covid-19 pandemic in the entire NCR area,” it said.The PM reiterated the need to observe personal hygiene and social discipline in public places. Modi said awareness about the pandemic should be disseminated widely and a continuous emphasis on preventing the spread of the infection should be laid. He said there is no room for any complacency in this regard.In the context of Delhi, Shah had stepped in last month to work with Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal to handle the coronavirus situation in the national capital amid steeply rising cases and criticism of lack of information on treatment, beds and facilities. Shah had discussed ways to check the spread of the virus in the NCR with the chief ministers of Delhi, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh.Having attributed the measures against the pandemic to the collective efforts of state, centre and local authorities is also seen as a message that the PM is looking to de-emphasise political point-scoring to the extent possible.",delhi,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-76916874,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-205054,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/pm-hails-united-efforts-in-delhis-covid-fight/articleshow/76916367.cms

NEW DELHI: Residents of Dwarka gathered on Saturday morning to protest against the alleged cutting of trees by National Highway Authority of India for developing an expressway through Sector-22 and Sector-23.

Protesters claimed that a contractor appointed by NHAI had come to clear the trees in the area for construction and expansion work.

Carrying placards reading “No to flyover in residential area” and “Save sector 22-23 trees,” protesters, including children, women and senior citizens, raised slogans against the project.

Sudha Sinha, president of Federation of Dwarka Co-operative Group Housing Societies, said that the residents wanted to protect the environment of the area and so came out in large numbers despite the ongoing Covid pandemic situation. “We followed social distancing norms during the protest,” she added.

Sinha claimed that over 2,500 trees would be removed from the area and suggested the use of an alternative route passing near Radha Soami Satsang Ashram.

“Thousands of trees that the residents have planted over last 15-20 years will perish due to the project and the residential character of our peaceful community will be ruined,” said Niraj Kumar, a resident of New Millenium apartments.

Environmental expert Dr Asha Sharma was also present among the protesters. “The expressway will involve cutting of many trees, which are more than 20 years old. Transplantation will not be a successful solution,” she said.

She added that there are 12 schools in the vicinity and the expressway project will ruin the community and residential character of the area. “I have filed several RTIs but nothing is being shared with residents.”

A senior NHAI official, however, said no tree was being cut and all the trees would be transplanted to a site within Dwarka. “We are not cutting a single tree. All trees will be transplanted as per the forest department guidelines. We have taken the requisite permission from the forest department regarding all the 5,700 trees of the entire project along the 7-kilometre stretch,” the official said. Regarding the alternative route, the official added that the alignments of the project being executed had been approved by UTTIPEC.

A police officer identified the arrested as Moorthy, of Navalpakkam in Tiruvannamalai district. He was residing in a rental house at Avvai Nagar at Chettipalayam on the outskirts of the city, along with his wife Geetha, 35.

Moorthy, he said, was arrested based on a complaint lodged by G Gowtham, 31, of Mangalam Nagar at Chellappampalayam , stating an unidentified person had stolen his three goats, which were grazing nearby his house.

“He said his neighbours had seen one man taking the goats away in the trunk of a white car that hadn’t any registration number plates. However, they had noticed a taxi aggregator’s logo in the vehicle,” the officer said.

The cab, he said, was registered with Go Taxi. Vadakkipalayam police sub-inspector (SI) T Rajendraprasath collected CCTV footage of white cab without registration plates and begun inquiry with the taxi aggregator. The SI and team arrested Moorthy on Friday evening, seized his car and recovered six goats, two of which he had stolen from the Gudimangalam police station limits.

307,['12/07/2020'],"Kerala gold smuggling case: After NIA, ED also joins investigation","The penalty under the Section 3 of FEMA can be up to three times the value of violation

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: After the Customs and the National Investigation Agency (NIA), the Enforcement Directorate ( ED ) has also joined the probe in the gold smuggling case via diplomatic channel through Thiruvananthapuram airport.

The ED’s zonal office in Kochi is learned to have opened a file (known as T1 file in the agency) and launched a preliminary inquiry into the matter, under the Section 3 of the Foreign Exchange Management Act. The agency is also set to register another case under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) on the basis of the FIR registered by the NIA by including the sections of Unlawful Activities Prevention Act.

The Section 3 of the FEMA says that except under the rules and regulations, no person should deal in or transfer any foreign exchange or foreign security to any unauthorised person, receive otherwise through an authorised person, any payment by order or on behalf of any person resident outside India in any manner or enter into any financial transaction in the country as consideration for or in association with acquisition or creation or transfer of any asset outside the country. As per the act, the financial transaction need not be in currency alone, but can also be as payment in any other form that can be gold as well.

The preliminary inquiry will be conducted on the basis of the seizure report of the customs. As part of the probe, the agency will gather information about the crime from other agencies. The penalty under the Section 3 of the Act can be up to three times the value of violation. In this case, this could be calculated as thrice the value of the 30kg smuggled gold.

Once the PMLA kicks in, the charges will be non-bailable, and several other measures like freezing of the bank document and attachment of properties, etc. would also follow. The penalty under PMLA can also include an imprisonment up to seven years. With the ED too joining the probe, the gold smuggling case has attained high importance, and it has become evident that the Centre has given top priority to the case.

Formed in 1957 to look into foreign exchange violations, the ED, which is the economic intelligence and prosecuting agency under the revenue department of the ministry of finance, has been more than active in the past couple of years, especially after it started investigating criminal cases under PMLA. The agency has conducted over 1,700 raids in connection with 1,500-plus specific investigations under the PMLA in the past 10 years.

The agency that had taken up cases against some top politicians across the country has also hit the headlines in the cases like that of Nirav Modi who left the country, in connection with the multi-crore Punjab National Bank fraud case. Though ED has been silently active in the state, the gold smuggling case could be one which will be an openly known high profile case for the agency in the state.

A corporation official said, “The creches, which are run by us along with the NGO SAVE, saw 11 children at Poyampalayam in zone 2 and 16 at Kovil Vazhi in zone 3 when they were reopened on Friday. Saturday also saw the same number of children in both the facilities.”

He said the children would be provided healthy food, including fruits and eggs, twice a day. “Precautionary measures like physical distancing and wearing of face masks are followed at the creches .”

The official said the creches, which were inaugurated about two years ago, were temporarily closed in March following the Covid-19 outbreak .

It also clarified that the video was taken when the worker was returning to her house after completing work. “We have issued a notice to the concerned contractor, who was also directed to ensure that the workers wear safety gears.”

Coimbatore MP P R Natarajan, along with MPs from the western region of Tamil Nadu and Palakkad had written to the ministry a month ago demanding the centre. In its replay, the ministry said a proposal is under examination to open the centres in Coimbatore and Madurai and sought the number of beneficiaries in the cities.

The centre will benefit central government employees, pensioners, former and current MPs, Natarajan said. “Every month, a certain amount will be debited from the beneficiaries’ salary and used to cover their medical expenses at CGHS facilities.”

The facility is now available only in the state capital, Natarajan said. “We have to travel to Chennai every time to avail the facility.

311,['12/07/2020'],10 railway bridges of NCR get water-level check systems,"AGRA: To constantly monitor condition of railway bridges over swollen rivers during monsoon , the railway authorities have installed water-level monitoring system at 10 major bridges in North Central Railway (NCR) zone.

The system has been introduced at Yamuna, Tons and Sone bridges in Prayagraj division, Yamuna bridge in Agra division and Chambal,Yamuna Kalpi, Bagin, Yamuna South Bank and two bridges on Betwa river in Jhansi division.

Sources said based on design, flow and other technical parameters, ""regular level, high flood level and danger level"" of water are identified for all railway bridges. In case water rises to critical level, precautionary action is initiated including regulation or stoppage of trains till the water recedes below the threshold level.

“In this advanced water-level monitoring system, the instrument continuously sends out ultrasonic waves which reflects back from top of the water flowing in the river. Time taken for ultrasonic waves to return to the instrument gives accurate measurement of water level in the river. The data is compared with prefixed reference level to assess actual level. The data is transmitted to the central server every five minutes, after which railway authorities take a decision on whether to continue the train operation on the bridge or not,” said a railway official.

In addition to 10 functional systems, five more major bridges in Jhansi division have been identified for the water-level monitoring system.

In a representation to the chief minster on Saturday, they sought friendly procedures to boost the real estate sector.

There should be a definite timeframe for approvals as the approval process through the local planning authority (LPA), directorate of town and country planning (DTCP) and the corporation, takes anywhere from six months to one year, said Surender Vittel, president, Credai Coimbatore. “We have to submit the plan to the LPA, which forwards it to DTCP, which sends it back to LPA, and the plan is sent to the corporation, which gives the licence. It takes more than eight months to get approval as it has to go to Chennai and come back,” he told TOI. “When we submit the blueprint for approval, the technical aspects are scrutinised here and in Chennai, which takes time. We are all for the authorities to scrutinise plans. But it should be done within a timeframe.”

There should be local offices for the approval process in districts, similar to the Chennai Metropolitan Development Authority (CMDA) in Chennai, Vittel said. “This will decentralise the approval process and reduce the time involved in travel to Chennai for approval.”

“We have to obtain no-objection certificates and recommendations from panchayats. This procedure is unclear. To rectify this, there should be an online single-window application and tracking system,” he said.

VIJAYAWADA: If the political development in Velagapudi are any indication, chief minister YS Jaganmohan Reddy may not insist the central government to introduce the bill seeking abolition of the state legislative council. The state Assembly had earlier passes a resolution seeking the Centre to abolish it.

However, government sources have told TOI that the state government would not insist on the development now.

The re-election of TDP MLC Dokka Manikya Varaprasad to the legislative council seems to have breathed life into the upper house with some MLCs reportedly willing to back the ruling YSR Congress. The opposition TDP, which now holds its sway with a 28-member strength in the 58-member House, is losing its majority now.

Manikya Varaprasad had quit the MLC post and the TDP in January 2020 before joining the ruling YSR Congress. Six months after he joined the ruling party, he was re-elected to the post unopposed in the Assembly quota. While his resignation is a loss to the TDP and re-election is a gain to the YSR Congress, it had also given hope to some of the MLCs who have plans to cross the fence and save their term.

As of now, there are two more vacancies in the council from the Assembly quota, which are likely to be filled in the next couple of months. Besides, there are three vacancies from the local bodies. However, as they will arise on June 18, 2021 it is not known whether the election commission would fill them or not.

CHENNAI: Any market in Chennai city that does not follow norms on social distancing and use of face masks will be summarily shut, Greater Chennai Corporation commissioner G Prakash has warned. The authorities are also mulling heavy monetary penalties for those violating norms.

Monitoring committees have been formed to regulate the 70 markets in city limits and efforts are on to install CCTV (Closed Circuit Television) camerasto continuously monitor whether traders and the public wear masks and maintain physical distancing, Prakash said on Saturday.

An assistant engineer with the city corporation, a sub-inspector from the local police, and members from the market and other departments will be part of the committees, which will assess the functioning of their markets every day. Special teams from the revenue and disaster management department will also supervise the functioning of markets.

“All these teams will observe the functioning of markets regularly and file periodical reports. All departments will have to work together as a team,” Prakash said.

Youngsters do not take face masks seriously: Corporation chief

Chennai corporation commissioner G Prakash said an informal survey by the civic body has shown that about 70 –75 % of the population wears masks. “Ruthless enforcement is the way. We have to ensure that the entire population wears masks,” Prakash said and added that it is the younger population that is not taking ‘mask wearing’ seriously. They should understand that it is important for them to wear masks to protect the elderly at home.

Civic body had also held meetings with officials from civil supply departments to ensure that token system is adhered to in all ration shops in the city. There are 1,761 ration shops in the city.

The commissioner noted that for the 11th continuous day, there has been a downward trend in number of positive cases in the city because of the intense lockdown and doubling of testing. To sustain this downward trend, it is possible only if there is strict enforcement, the commissioner said and added that they are also considering strict monetary penalty for flouting norms.

318,['12/07/2020'],Pune Lockdown Update: Panic buying before lockdown throws Covid caution to wind,"(With inputs from Nisha Nambiar, Sarang Dastane)

PUNE: The local administration’s decision to enforce a 10-day total lockdown from Tuesday is likely to have unintended consequences due to people crowding market places to purchase essentials, experts and public servants have warned.The World Health Organisation too has said spontaneous mass gatherings of people during an infectious disease event amplify a pathogen’s transmission and have the potential to disrupt the host country or city's response capacity.In Pune, medical experts said the large crowds of customers outside shops — seen throughout Friday and Saturday — can defeat the very purpose of a lockdown.“People venturing out in large numbers and queuing up outside shops will most certainly aid in the spread of the contagion,” said Sanjay Patil, chairman of the Indian Medical Association’s Hospital Board of India, Pune chapter.Virologist Renu Bharadwaj said, “A lockdown only gives us breathing space to ramp up medical facilities. It does not help in arresting the spread of the virus. People mingling and overcrowding outside shops ahead of the proposed lockdown will spread the infection.”An epidemiologist told TOI that for a lockdown to have full effect, it has to be for 14 days — the incubation period of Covid-19 and at least another week for the residual infection to die out. “One is aware of this 21-day rule for a lockdown. What is 10 days?” the expert asked.A retired bureaucrat said, “Just 3% of PMC limits is under containment. We just had to focus on these areas and not punish the rest.”Others said previous lockdowns were not handled well. “If they believe it is the people’s responsibility, then a lockdown is not the answer. What they could not implement effectively in the past two to three months cannot suddenly be implemented again,” a senior official said.A serving bureaucrat said he does not believe in lockdowns. “Such curbs are not in the interest of people or the economy. Epidemiologists have shared studies that prove their ineffectiveness,” he said.Within the city’s political circles, criticism was swift. The BJP city unit chief, Jagdish Mulik, said the new lockdown was an attempt by the government to hide failures. “I wonder why there is no lockdown in Mumbai, where the situation is far more serious,” he said. “The local administration should have come out with a stronger plan that seeks to increase testing, contact tracing, distribution of masks and social distancing. Elected representatives and political parties were not consulted before announcing the lockdown, which will also have a widespread impact on livelihoods,” Mulik added.Ajay Shinde, the city head of MNS, said the decision to re-impose a lockdown has created a lot of confusion.“It has led to panic buying at shops. Why is the administration not being strict on those violating curbs? Why is it putting everyone under a lockdown again,” he asked.",pune,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-76917017,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-775837,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/panic-buying-before-lockdown-throws-covid-caution-to-wind/articleshow/76916368.cms

NOIDA: A couple, who had allegedly eloped from a village in Bihar, was found hanging inside a rented accommodation in Sector 51 here on Saturday, the police said.

The woman’s eight-month-old daughter was found inside the room and was immediately taken to Shivalik Hospital, said an officer, adding that she is currently in the ICU. The police said the 22-year-old man — Aniket from Bihar’s Siwan — and the woman, who was also likely in her 20s, were staying in a rented room in Hoshiarpur village from July 7.

Their neighbours told police that a foul smell was emanating from the room when they informed house owner Munshi Ram Yadav. They also heard the infant crying and Yadav then called the police.

ADCP (zone 1) Ranvijay Singh said a team from Sector 49 police station reached the spot and broke open the door to find the couple hanging from a ceiling fan. The infant was found sitting on the floor.

“Prima facie, the two hanged themselves a day or two before their decomposed bodies were found. The bodies have been sent for post-mortem,” said Singh. “Aniket’s brother said he had eloped with the married woman and her daughter on July 4. The woman’s kin has been informed,” said Singh.

The move comes after the district’s Covid-19 tally crossed the 1,000-mark a day earlier than projected.

An official said they had tried out home quarantine once and were not satisfied with the results. Home isolation of asymptomatic patients is widely practiced in Chennai and Madurai, where all hospital beds are occupied.

Officials had begun ramping up bed strength in hospitals and care centres after it was projected that the district was likely to see a total of 4,000 cases by August 1, going by the current doubling time of cases.

Collector K Rajamani said, “Home quarantine could be allowed for patients who are asymptomatic or those with extremely mild symptoms. They should not have any comorbidities and not be in the age group of 50 and above.”

There are other factors to be considered as well, says another official. “We need to know the number of members in the house, whether there is enough space and room for the patient to remain in quarantine and if the patient is educated enough to understand the importance of isolation.”

If the house is cramped and there are people above 60 and small children, he said, they might not allow even a 30-year-old to home quarantine if there are beds available in Covid care centres.

According to sources, an asymptomatic patient from Podanur was allowed to home quarantine last week after he refused to get admitted to the government hospital in Pollachi . “Three days later, his mother was rushed to the ESI Hospital with breathlessness and tested positive for the virus. His wife also contracted the virus.”

GREATER NOIDA: At least two people have been booked for allegedly duping an aspiring actor of nearly Rs 18 lakh on the pretext of helping him in getting launched in Bollywood .

The victim, a 22-year-old resident of Sector Beta II, has alleged that he met Mavelin Messi, the main accused, through his childhood friend Jonah David few months back. Mavelin claimed to have contacts in advertisement, modelling and casting agencies in Mumbai and allegedly took Rs 18 lakh from him in two instalments for registering him with talent promoters. But later, Mavelin went incommunicado.

An FIR under IPC sections 406 ( criminal breach of trust), 120B (criminal conspiracy) and 506 (criminal Intimidation) has been registered against Mavelin and Jonah, and few unnamed persons, on the complaint of the victim’s father Sunil Chaudhary, a real estate developer.

“Mavelin had earlier worked with a PR firm in Mumbai and was in Noida for his wedding. He told my son that he can introduce him to various talent managers in Bollywood and can also get him modelling assignments. He also took my son to Mumbai a couple of times, where they attended parties hosted by Bollywood personalities,” Chaudhary told police.

Chaudhary alleged that Mavelin made his son transfer around Rs 9.5 lakh into his account on the pretext of getting him registered with talent management companies and acting classes. “He later took around Rs 8 lakh in cash, saying he needs help to make arrangements for his wedding,” he said. “When we asked him to fulfil his commitment, Mavelin threatened my son with dire consequences, and now, he is incommunicado.”

A building contractor who attended the ceremony developed symptoms the next day and sought treatment at three hospitals unfolding the details of the ceremony and sent the whole village unsettled on July 5. He was later tested positive.The 13 persons tested positive on Saturday are members of two or three families who attended the function. A total of 122 primary contacts of the building contractor have been identified till Saturday. Besides his wife and son, samples of 16 primary contacts were taken of which 13 tested positive. His wife and son tested positive earlier.Of the 13 posytive cases, 12 belong to Keezhmad panchayat and one person hails from Kavalangad panchayat.“Total 21 active cases hailing from the panchayat are undergoing treatment. The source of infection of the building contractor has not been identified so far since he travels to various places as part of his work. We also don’t know whether he contracted the virus from any asymptomatic person who attended the function. When the case of the building contractor came out, we started to trace his contacts from June 26. But lack of cooperation from the family, which hosted the function, made it difficult to trace people. They gave us details of only 44 people to draw a veil over the actual number of people attended it. Nearly 500 people, both primary and secondary contacts of the positive cases, have been quarantined so far and the tracing is still continuing. But lack of cooperation is marring our efforts,” said Keezhmad panchayat health standing committee chairperson Abilash Asokan.All wards of the panchayat have been declared as containment zones and all roads have been closed. “Samples of 44 primary contacts of the building contractor have been taken on Saturday,” he said.Additional district medical officer S Sreedevi said they expect more cases from Keezhmadu.Keezhmad is one of the neighbouring panchayats of Aluva market, where 27 positive cases were reported till Friday. “Most of the people working in the market, where vegetables and fish are sold mostly, are from neighbouring panchayats. The first case related to the market was reported in an autorickshaw driver at an auto stand functioning near the market under the flyover. Around 150 people including headload workers work in the market per day. The first case was reported not from the market but from Kadungalloor panchayat,” says Aluva municipality chairperson Lissy Abraham.Health officials said they would conduct widespread testing of people who came in contact with the infected persons in Aluva region. “We have taken 367 samples randomly from the area.

HYDERABAD: Ten days after his five-year-old daughter was murdered by his wife’s friend, a 37-year-old man committed suicide by throwing himself in front of a train at Bhongir on Saturday. At 2 pm, a few children, who reside abutting the railway track, saw the body and informed their parents, who in turn alerted the local railway staff, Bhongir police said.

Police, who reached the spot after making enquires with locals, identified the 37-year-old victim.

During investigation, they came to know that he was a resident of Ghatkesar and, on July 1, his daughter was murdered by one Karunakaran, an alleged paramour of his wife.

The accused killed the girl as he was angry that his lover had been avoiding him and was moving closely with another man. Since the death of his daughter, the 37-year-old man had been staying at his brothers’ residence in Bhongir. He was upset with his wife and disturbed over the murder of their daughter. Around 9.30am on Saturday, he left his brothers’ residence and went up to the railway track. He switched off his mobile phone and later committed suicide. Police did not find any suicide note on the person. Ghatkesar police had already arrested Karunakaran, who killed the five-year-old by slitting her throat.

On July 1, when Karunakaran went to meet his lover at her residence in a gated community, he saw her allegedly in another man’s company and this upset him.

He threatened the woman to come out otherwise he would harm her daughter, who was standing close to him.

As the woman refused to come out of the room, an enraged Karunakaran slit the child’s throat with a blade.

Fernandes, the former Calangute MLA, questioned if the government had conducted a study on the amount of garbage generated in the two constituencies and other places along with an assessment of the environmental impact on the surrounding villages.

Naik also took the opportunity to take a broad swipe at GFP MLA Jayesh Salgaonkar and former Saligao MLA Dilip Parulekar. “Let Jayesh bring out a letter of dissent that he submitted to the cabinet.

In total, the camera traps captured 34,858,623 photographs of wildlife (76,651 of which were tigers and 51,777 were leopards; the remainder were other native fauna). From these photographs, 2,461 individual tigers (excluding cubs) were identified using stripe-pattern-recognition software,” the Guiness team that announced India’s feat added.Welcoming India’s entry into the Guiness World Records, Union environment and foreign minister Prakash Javadekar said, “We are happy that the proactive measures taken in the area of conservation and environment under the leadership of PM Modi have been endorsed formally and India has been lauded for conducting the most comprehensive survey yet.”In addition to camera trap usage, India’s 2018 “Status of Tigers in India” assessment also conducted extensive foot surveys that covered 522,996 km of trails and sampled 317,958 habitat plots for vegetation and prey dung. It is estimated that the total area of forest studied was 381,200 sq km and cumulatively the collection and review of data equated to some 620,795 labour-days.The assessment was carried out over three phases, with the various datasets then combined to be extrapolated via statistical computation. A positive outcome of the survey was that it concluded that India’s tiger population had increased by roughly one-third: from 2,226 in 2014 to 2,927 in 2018, though the Guiness team says “some have cautioned that this rise may in part reflect more comprehensive surveying as opposed to purely a population surge”.",home,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-76916652,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-55520,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//home/environment/flora-fauna/largest-ever-camera-trap-wildlife-survey-puts-india-in-record-books/articleshow/76916656.cms

Around 219 prisoners have tested positive so far making it the highest from any state prison. Till date, 57 jail staffers and around 40 of their family members too have tested positive. 40 staffers were discharged on Saturday.

As per a reliable source, there is a serious co-ordination issue cropping up between the prison authorities and the government hospitals. “The prisoners were brought for testing after a delay of several hours which caused inconvenience to other Covid patients. Also, there should proper bifurcation of the responsibilities between the GMCH and Mayo hospital regarding the treatment of the prisoners and jail staffers,” said the source.

After checking, the prisoners are to be shifted back to the makeshift barracks-turned-Covid care centre (CCC) in the prison if found asymptomatic. Till going to the press, the X-rays and other tests of the prisoners were under way at the two government hospitals.

Additional DG Sunil Ramanand, who is camping in the city, said a community hall on the Home Guard’s Dhantoli premises has been earmarked to be developed as CCC for the Central Jail instead of the earlier thought about sports complex at Mankapur. “We are now in the process to shift the prisoners,” he said.

District collector Ravindra Thakare said testing would be continued in the prison but only of the older prisoners, the ones with co-morbidities and also for anyone developing symptoms, in random manner.

“There are only two doctors at present in the prison. They look after treatment and other medical needs of prisoners and staffers for treatment, totalling around 2,000. We are now increasing the number of doctors by two to four who have been finalized by the civil surgeon,” said Thakare.

“Muraleedharan had said that gold was not carried in diplomatic baggage. But NIA made it clear on Saturday that gold was smuggled in a diplomatic baggage. This has cast shadows on Muraleedharan. It may be recalled that a clearing agent having Sangh Parivar connections had threatened the customs officials to release the baggage. Though clearing agents have no role in releasing diplomatic baggage, he had intervened. It can be suspected that Muraleedharan’s statement was for whitewashing planners and conspirators of the deal. In this circumstance, it will be ideal for Muraleedharan to think whether it is proper on his part to continue in the office of the MoS external affairs,” Kodiyeri Balakrishnan said in a statement here.

He said the advocate who is representing Swapna Suresh is a leader of Hindu Economic Forum. “It is interesting that an advocate who believes in a movement that heralds patriotism has taken the vakalath of an accused in a sedition case. All these point to the fact that the thief is within the ship,” he said.

The CPM state secretary also alleged that aides of the accused are engaged in a vociferous protest in the streets of Kerala and BJP and UDF are united in that. “People of Kerala will realize the ulterior motives of UDF-BJP alliance during the time of a pandemic,” he said.

Kodiyeri said transferring the case to NIA has underlined the state government’s stand that any central agency could probe the case. “Several people pointed fingers at many and claimed that there was evidence against them. The 43(f) clause of UAPA facilitates that. Let them hand over evidence to NIA. But, note that those who provide false evidence will be penalized. If they are not giving any evidence, we can say whatever they had claimed were false,” he said.

However, ED argued that AP Gems and Jewellery was a Choksi-owned company with 89% stake in it.

We needed a shelter for the quarantine period. He was housed in a shelter home in the city but he twisted the window bars and escaped. He was tracked at Kollam and then brought back on Sunday. Since he got out and was in our care, we had to take him back as the missing complaint is filed in the North police station. We arranged for an ambulance to bring him back and now he is housed in another home with the support from the district administration,” said Bitty Joseph, CWC chairperson.She said they have had quite a few cases during the lockdown which has necessitated the urgent need for a temporary shelter.Child help volunteers who work with police, Childline and railways said they often find a reluctance to accommodate street children in permanent shelter homes because of the errant behaviour of the newcomers. “They often fear that their own inmates will catch the habits including bad behaviour, withdrawal symptoms of drug abuse and violent acts. If we have a temporary home, we could spend at least a week with the child and bring him/her around to a near normal behaviour and then transfer him to a permanent home if he/she is showing a better behaviour,” said a Childline official.Also, most rescue takes place late at night or early in the morning and homes hesitate to admit these children.The railway child help desk has rescued 282 children between April 2019 and March 2020.

342,['12/07/2020'],"Indians in US court senators, rally against Trump’s visa move","HYDERABAD: Perturbed with the F1 visa decision, the Indian community in the US is doing all that it could to get justice to the Indian students. Several groups are petitioning politicians as well as universities to give students the freedom to take online classes during the pandemic.

The American Telugu Association (ATA) is reaching out to multiple members of US Congress urging them to influence US President Donald Trump to rescind the order that directs international students to leave the US this fall, if classes are online. Through ATA members across the country, the group has submitted memorandums to over 50 senators in key states. The senators, especially those from the Republican party, have lot of influence with the Trump administration.

The ATA memorandum, signed by president Parmesh Bheemreddy , reads: “International students contribute significantly to the American economy, innovation, and growth. According to NAFSA: Association of International Educators… international students studying at US colleges and universities contributed $41 billion and supported 458,290 jobs to the US economy during the 2018-2019 academic year.” Arguing against the current decision, the statement adds: “Requiring international students to depart from the country during these challenging Covid times is not a practical approach and puts them under immense financial and health risks, while also causing budgetary shortfalls to universities and colleges. This is also an inhumane action and is against the founding principles of this country.”

Another student organization, North American Association of Indian Students (NAAIS) has started a movement “#suethegovernment”. The Association says: “Asking your university to sue the Trump administration for their misguided policies is imperative to protect the globally acclaimed higher-level education system America prides itself upon.” This follows Harvard and MIT suing the Trump administration over its guidance to prevent international students from taking online courses.

Mandrekar alleged that Melauli villagers employed in government departments are being punished for opposing the IIT project by being transferred to far off places. “Lata Gaonkar, a handicapped anganwadi worker, who was posted at Murmune-Sattari has been transferred to Quepem just because her husband has opposed the IIT project,” he said, questioning how a handicapped person was supposed to travel daily to Quepem.

“Congress fully supports the Melauli villagers in opposing the IIT project. I challenge health minister and Valpoi MLA Vishwajit Rane to fight legally, instead of harassing and threatening the poor villagers,” he said.

Congress member Nandakumar Kopordekar said that most villagers from Melauli are dependent on agriculture and the IIT project will take away their livelihood.

PANAJI: In these stressful days of the Covid-19 pandemic, parishioners of Our Lady of Amparo Church at Mandur in the Tiswadi taluka have largely been able to keep their spiritual quotient buoyed from the comfort of their homes.

While many faithful from other parishes presently avail live-streamed religious services — often interrupted by network glitches — parishioners in Mandur wait to hear the resonant voice of their parish priest, Fr Roland Carvalho, over the church’s public address system early in the morning to begin their spiritual connect with God as they sip a cup of tea or go about their daily chores.

By increasing the volume of the church’s sound system by a few decibels, Carvalho has been able to reach out to most of his parishioners and even border residents of Neura and Azossim, on either side.

“We feel like we are in church when Mass begins at 7am or 8am on Sundays,” Albert Fernandes, an elderly parishioner, said.

Ensconced on a hill slope , the elevated location of the 300-odd-year-old church provides an optimal platform to transport religious services to several areas, including the scenic Dongorim island which is now connected by a culvert.

“Parishioners in eight wards, except Manxebhat beyond Dongorim hill, and nearby villagers have responded well to the daily service,” Carvalho said.

This new normal in Mandur began on curfew day, March 22, before the nationwide lockdown begun.

“On March 21, I celebrated the last Mass with my parishioners, a simple service instead of the solemn one I had planned earlier to mark the silver jubilee of my priesthood,” Carvalho said.

Although Mandur has reported a few Covid-positive cases recently, villagers like Joaquim Fernandes say the daily religious services are crucial to keeping their spirits up. “The morning service has now become even more important for us to prayerfully connect with God,” Fernandes said.

348,['12/07/2020'],Lack of cold chain infra hits farmers,"Kochi: Over the past one month, the price of cassava dropped to Rs 7 per kg hitting the farmers in the district who were struggling to find a market for their produce amid the Covid-19 lockdown . In the absence of avenues to process the produce or make value-added products the farmers had no option but to suffer in silence or feed them to cattle after cooking them.

Pineapple farmers too had faced the same situation as tonnes of produce rotted away with no takers in March and April this year. “This would not have happened if there was a cold chain infrastructure in our area,” says Antony P M, a farmer in Kothamangalam who lost 50 tonnes of pineapple in April this year. The maximum price he got was Rs 10 per kg. A year ago they had fetched him up to Rs 48 per kg.

State government had tried to revive Nadukkara Agro Processing Company to help the Vazhakkulam farmers in distress but it was of little help because they were unable to provide a price that would help them break even.

“Our biggest issue is lack of avenues to market the produce and infrastructure to preserve the produce till we get a better price. We spend Rs 25 to cultivate one kilogram of pineapple and unless farmers get at least Rs 30 they will lose money,” said Antony. According to experts, establishing a cool chain, with a cold store at the farm and refrigerated trucks are important if the quality of the product is to be ensured. Currently the district does not have such infrastructure.

“In Maradu market, agricultural department has five cold storages but they have been rented out to private players. If suddenly there is a surplus we don’t have any facility to stock produce,” said principal agricultural officer Dileepkumar. There are several central schemes which offer subsidies to develop such critical infrastructure but they have not been explored.

Farmers are fearing fall in prices in the coming months as many have ventured into farming, especially tubers like cassava. Horticorp is currently procuring cassava for Rs 18 per kg but most farmers who have no avenues to market their produce are forced to sell them as low as Rs 7. “A major consumer of cassava were hotels, bars and wayside eateries that spring up during the night time. Because of the lockdown we lost out,” said Nedungapra Karshaka Sangham Vipani president V G Jaimon.

350,['12/07/2020'],Students beat lockdown by selling veggies,"Madurai: If the lockdown has spurred some to be creative, it has also made others entrepreneurial and support their families in these troubled times. For a month now, a group of youngsters in Dindigul, mostly college students , have been earning a living by selling vegetables in a shop they have set up.

Among them is B Sabari who was employed at a BPO in Chennai before returning to his hometown at Eriyodu in Vedasandur taluk of Dindigul district during the lockdown. Three others — T Matheesh Kumar, an MBA student, R Manikandan, BSc final year student, and T Venkatesh, who is pursuing BCom, — decided to join hands with him to ease the financial burden on their families during the period.

“We pooled the money we had and mobilised Rs 8,000, and thus was born our vegetable shop,’’ they said. They take turns in going to the Dindigul market to procure vegetables and bring back about 150 kg everyday. “We procure for about Rs 5,000 every day and keep our margins low to meet the competition from already existing shops. But we make a reasonably good income, which is helping all of us,’’ said R Manikandan. If the retail price of tomato is Rs 60 a kg, they price it at Rs 50, which has already earned them a group of 20 regular customers , among the 100-odd daily customers.

The friends say their venture has given them a lot of hope and made them realize that self-sustenance always helps. “When the Covid-19 crisis ends and go back to college, they have decided to continue with their shop. Perhaps, we will develop it into a supermarket selling all essential commodities including meat and fish,” said Sabari.

The Margao Congress MLA also asked if the government has prepared a healthcare plan for Goa to tackle the pandemic.

“How many more deaths does the government need in order to show sensitivity towards Covid patients and provide proper food and other facilities?” Kamat said.

On Friday, chief minister Pramod Sawant and Union minister of state for defence Shripad Naik met with high-ranking officials of the Armed Forces to discuss the way forward if Covid-19 cases increase in Goa.

Kamat has been asking Sawant since March to create a task force comprising experts from all sectors, including the army, to handle the pandemic. He had also written to PM Narendra Modi with a similar request.

“Now when the government has realised the importance of taking help from army, it is important to not waste any more time,” he said.

South Goa Lok Sabha MP Francisco Sardinha also voiced his criticism against the state government’s strategy to combat the pandemic.

“It has failed totally because from a Green Zone, we have come to the current situation. There is no proper planning here,” Sardinha said after attending a virtual meeting of all Lok Sabha MLAs with Congress interim president Sonia Gandhi.

353,['12/07/2020'],'Exempt Himachal Pradesh from forest laws for water supply mission',"Himachal Pradesh governor Bandaru Dattatraya

SHIMLA: Pleading on the behalf of the state, Himachal Pradesh governor Bandaru Dattatraya has demanded an exemption for the state from Forest Conservation Act, 1980 and the Forest Rights Act, 2006, to implement Jal Jeevan Mission.

Dattatraya has written a letter Union minister of environment, forests and climate change Prakash Javadekar in this regard and requested him to look into the matter personally and issue necessary directions. He assured there would not be any felling of trees nor any damage would be caused to the ecology of the areas where these schemes would be executed. Most components of the project such as pipes and trenches would be either underground or not cause damage to trees, he added.

He brought to the notice of the Union Minister that the state was facing a peculiar problem in implementing the Jal Jeevan Mission (JJM) as most ridge lines in the state were forest lands and no non-forestry activity was allowed there.

Dattatraya said all the activities related to construction of gravity-based water supply schemes such as storage and conservation structure; laying of main pipelines and distribution network were classified as non-forestry activities. As a result, almost all the schemes being built under the Jal Jeevan Mission were lift water supply schemes, he said.

He said instead of holding the water along the ridges, it was first allowed to drain to the valley and then lifted up with electric power to be supplied to the villages. This added to the cost and created other problems too.

The governor said the exemption could be one time under the Forest Rights Act, 2006. He said it was estimated that the state would save an amount of Rs 700 to 750 crore, annually that was spent on construction and maintenance of these schemes.

Himachal Pradesh was a hilly state and most of the area was covered with forests, he said, adding that the state had a successful afforestation programme which was evident from the fact that the forest cover had increased by 33.52 square kilometer between 2017 and 2019. He said that the recorded forest area of the state has 62.32% of total geographical area and had declared all non-private land as forest land in line with the provisions of the Forest Conservation Act, 1980.

SHIMLA: Located close to China border , Spiti valley of tribal Lahaul-Spiti district in Himachal Pradesh is set to get another helipad at Key village, as the Union ministry of environment, forest and climate change has given in-principle approval for diversion of 0.92 hectare of forest land in favour of the public works department for the purpose.

In a letter to Himachal additional chief secretary (forests), the ministry has informed about the in-principle approval for the diversion of forest land to construct helipad at Key village in Lahaul-Spiti district.

Agriculture and tribal affairs minister Dr Ram Lal Markanda, who also represents the Lahaul-Spiti assembly constituency, said the construction of this helipad would be of great benefit to the residents of surrounding villages, as during the winters, helicopter would be able to airlift them in case of an emergency. He said the availability of helipad would also boost tourism-related activities in the area, as Key monastery receives visitors from across the globe.

Situated at an altitude of over 13,000 feet above the sea level, Key village is known for its monastery. Local resident Chhering Dorje said the issue of helipad had been pending since long, but after the central government’s approval, it is likely to be constructed soon. “A helipad in Key is surely going to boost tourism, besides making life easier for the local residents, as during medical emergencies, people need to be airlifted,” he said.

This helipad will be the 15th one in Lahaul-Spiti district, with others being located at Satingri, Udaipur, Tindi, Tingrit Baaring, Rawa, Tandi, Gondhla, Sissu, Jispa, Chokhang, Losar, Kaza, Sagnam and Tabo.

Industrial estates have also put up their own standard operating procedures to be followed to ensure that the spread of the coronavirus in manufacturing facilities is halted.

Goa State Industries Association has also said that industrial units are ready to comply with additional guidelines put in place by the state government, but warned that long periods of shutdown was detrimental to the industrial units, the economy and the workers employed at the units.

“The government has appointed two nodal officers, one for each collector’s office and we have the president of each industrial estate as the nodal officer for each estate,” said GSIA president Damodar Kochkar. “If any cases are detected by either of the nodal officers then they will inform the authorities quickly so that preventive steps can be taken.”

The SOP for industrial units requires all employees to be screened with thermal scanners. All employees must wear face masks at all times, including during travel. The SOP restricts non-staff members from entering industrial units while workers and non-staff members from containment zones are prohibited from entering the company premises.

The SOP also makes it mandatory for all industrial units to maintain details of all employees along with their travel history. “If at all any employee is found with symptoms, then do be open and transparent, and contact the local Industrial estate president and local health officer and ensure that he or she is positively tested and isolated till results are available,” said Kochkar.

The SOP has been shared with all the industrial units who have been asked to take proactive measures to curb the spread of the virus.

The units have also been asked to maintain strict confidentiality about the identity of workers who test positive for Covid-19. “The info should only be shared with the local industrial person that is the local COVID-19 nodal officer, the local health officer and the respective collector only,” said Kochkar.

With the inauguration of the first phase of the Rs 5-crore Kanjiramattam Millunkal tourism project on Friday, Amballur panchayat successfully showed the way to address a civic issue with bearing on local environment and health of its populace through a development project.

“We repeatedly cleaned the canal spending lakhs of rupees from plan fund, installed surveillance cameras to check the menace of waste dumping. But nothing seemed to work. Then it dawned on us that unless we make use of the canal we could not save the waterbody or solve the issue of waste dumping,” says Amballur panchayat planning committee vice-chairman Mukundan P A.

Both sides of Millunkal canal used to be cultivable land which were abandoned and became a convenient spot for dumping of waste because it was not inhabited and was located close to the highway. The panchayat cleaned up the 750m-long canal, which connects Konothu Puzha, with the help of the irrigation department before commencing work on the park.

The park landscaped with buffalo grass and Mexican grass has an open stage, selfie point, play station for children, an open gym, a 3,000 sq ft restaurant space and a toilet block. A small sewage treatment plant has also been built to handle the waste generated by the project, said Mukundan.

The first phase of the project was completed at a cost of Rs 2 crore. “In the second phase we are planning to develop a walkway along the canal and a rainbow bridge. Tourism minister has said that the government would consider granting funds for the second phase after the end of the pandemic,” said Mukundan.

The panchayat expects the project would generate income for the local body and also help businesses in the surrounding areas. “We are thinking of launching a boat service with the help of a private agency soon as the second phase might be delayed,” said Mukundan. Panchayat has also plans to tap the tourism potential of spots like Njandukadu Thuruthu once the project is completed. The project was inaugurated by tourism minister Kadakampally Surendran through videoconferencing.

Mosquito menace due the thick vegetation and rain water gushing through the shelters also add to the problem. Plastic and other waste flows in with the water, leading to unhygienic conditions inside the shelter.

Snakes are a common sight and the fear of them entering the shelters, especially during the night has been keeping the police personnel guarding the five entry points 24x7 on the edge.

Cortalim MLA Alina Saldanha said, “I will direct the Sancoale panchayat to get the contractor remove the garbage and also to clear the thick vegetation from the area.”

CHANDIGARH: In what appears to be significant revelation in the Sonipat liquor theft scam, it has been learnt that sacked inspector Jasbir Singh had settled with 1,100 cases of illicit liquor out of the 2,200 cases that were seized from kingpin Bhupender Singh in March.

According to sources, this information first came to light in the confessional statement of Bhupender Singh and the same was further corroborated by ASI Jaipal Singh, a close confident of Jasbir Singh and the investigating officer in the case.

It is alleged that a total 2,200 cases of IMFL were seized from Bhupender Singh. While the kingpin and his driver were supposed to be booked by the police, Bhupender brokered a deal with Jasbir and gave him 1,100 cases. As ASI Jaipal Singh was the investigating officer in the case, he dropped Bhupender’s name and arrested the driver of the vehicle in which the liquor was ferried.

Notably, all this came to the fore when the special investigation team (SIIT) had arrested Jasbir in a that was registered into this particular incident. Jasbir was in SIT custody and SIT as well cops remained accessible to comment over the issue.

“Investigations are still in progress,” a cop remarked when asked to about the 1,100 liquor cases that were to be recovered from Jasbir Singh,

It may be recalled that the incident dates back to May 1-2 when the Sonipat police registered a case into theft and misappropriation of 9,000 cases of liquor that had gone missing from the godown in Kharkhoda

It was alleged that the liquor had been smuggled out by Bhupender’s group, allegedly in connivance with Inspector Jasbir, the then SHO of Kharkhoda police station. Jasbir was the last person to be arrested by the SIT earlier this month. Prior to him SIT had arrested Bhupender, his aide, ASI Jaipal and excise inspector Dhirender. Bhupender’s brother is on the run.

361,['12/07/2020'],Ramesh Chennithala insists on FIR by Kerala cops in smuggling case,"Ramesh Chennithala

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The failure of Kerala Police to register an FIR was a ruse to help the accused, opposition leader Ramesh Chennithala said here on Saturday. He warned of opting for legal recourse if state police fail to file an FIR in the case immediately.

Ramesh said chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan was trying to trivialize the gold smuggling case and the connections the key accused have with the CM’s office. “How can he simply wash off his hands by saying that it’s just another customs case. His arguments that the smuggling happened inside the airport and Kerala Police have nothing to do with it hold no water. It’s clear that his office was involved in the case,” the opposition leader said.

The police have to adhere to the laws of the country including Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC), Indian Penal Code and orders of the court while functioning, and cannot act as per the whims and fancies of any person, he argued at a press conference here.

He said he has “written a letter to the state police chief in the issue with a copy to SHO Valiyathura police station, Thiruvananthapuram . It is really a matter of worry that the police have not registered an FIR, even a week after the smuggling case was reported. It is because of the delay in registering an FIR that Swapna Suresh could move a bail application in Kerala high court, pointing out that she doesn’t have a criminal background.”

Ramesh said, “CBI investigation is needed simultaneously to probe the corruption and other criminal aspects as the case has direct links with the chief minister’s office.”

The SAD said the latest order of Punjab chief secretary Vini Mahajan taking the inquiry from the vigilance department and entrusting it to the Amritsar police had shaken people’s faith in the state Congress government.

SAD leader Bikram Singh Majithia said concerted efforts were being made by Congress leaders to shield those involved in the diagnostic centre and hospital in Amritsar which declared Covid-19 negative patients as positive and kept them with positive patients in isolation centres to extort money from them.

Majithia said that the vigilance department was entrusted with the probe after Amritsar police failed to make headway due to alleged political pressure. The Majitha MLA added that an attempt to murder case was registered against owners of the diagnoistic centre and two technicians associated with it. Also, a case of fraud was registered against the owner and doctor of the private hospital.

The Akali leader alleged that the about turn in the case occurred after the private hospital owner held a meeting with senior officers two days back. He alleged that one of the OSDs to the chief minister played a major role in sabotaging investigations and acted as a “sales person for the private laboratory.”

The Akali leader said a nine month pregnant woman was wrongfully shown as Covid-19 positive by the private laboratory and kept in an isolation ward with positive patients, putting her life at risk. Subsequently, two tests conducted by the Guru Nanak Dev Medical College laboratory proved that she was Covid-19 negative.

Chief minister TS Rawat said that barring Haridwar , where the project has been completed already, works would be started in the other 12 districts to ensure better connectivity to villages. “We have already distributed 300 satellite phones in the villages close to border areas. We know that the call charges of these phones are high. Hence, we are working on a plan to bear at least a part of the bill thus generated. Be it border issues with China or Covid-19, none of it is permanent. However, the BharatNet project will have a long and lasting impact, especially in areas with tough geographical conditions,” he added.

The CM said, “The Centre has approved Rs 2,000 crore for the project. The start of internet services in all gram panchayats will usher in a new era of development and the rural economy will gain pace. The project is funded by the Universal Services Obligation Fund under the Union ministry of telecommunications . The project is being implemented in two phases by the Bharat Broad Band Network Limited (BBNL).”

According to Rawat, the implementation of phase II of BharatNet project would facilitate e-governance, e-office, e-district, e-health, tele-medicine, e-education, e-banking and e-Naam (eNAM) to help people become self-reliant and garner opportunities through self-employment.

365,['12/07/2020'],Out of touch?,"Chennai: It’s been five months since Shibu Joseph saw his family. And four months since he has shaken hands with anyone. The corporate trainer, who flies to Doha every month on work, has been stranded there after the coronavirus pandemic broke out. But though he is put up in a five-star hotel and lacks no amenities, what he misses is basic human touch.

""I still remember shaking hands with my colleague after a seminar on March 1. I never thought it would be the last time I would be touching another human being,"" says the 45-year-old, adding that strict social distancing norms were put in place by his company after the first coronavirus case in Qatar was reported end of February. ""I have virtual meetings every day but am anxious about my family back home and all I want sometimes is a reassuring hug.""

The pandemic has impacted lives in many ways, depriving many people of jobs, company of friends and family, and most importantly, human touch. Months into lockdown, many are suffering from touch starvation, or skin hunger, and that can increase the sense of isolation, loneliness and anxiety, say experts.

Human beings are wired to touch and be touched. ""Human beings are social animals; we want social connectedness and physical bonding. Touch is important, whether it’s a mother hugging her child, an adolescent cuddling his girlfriend, or the healing touch older people yearn for,"" says psychiatrist Dr M Suresh Kumar. ""Right now, I am practising telemedicine but people miss the warm handshake a doctor gives. Physical contact is a form of communication.""

A touch can mean many things — it can comfort, demonstrate support, reassure, or demonstrate love. In ‘Munna Bhai MBBS’, the protagonist speaks of the power of ‘jaadu ki jhappi’ (magical hug).

According to a 2018 study by scientists at the Medical College of Wisconsin in Milwaukee, US, skin, the largest organ, communicates positive and negative touch stimuli to sensory neurons. The outermost layer of the skin, the epidermis, is mainly made up of billions of keratinocyte cells that release the chemical adenosine triphosphate, which activates receptors on the sensory nerve to convey the sensation of touch to the brain.

When one feels a friendly touch, the brain releases oxytocin, the love hormone which promotes feelings of trust, positivity, bonding and well-being, and also decreases fear and anxiety.

The touch does not have to be sexual, any positive touch is beneficial. And with the pandemic, when anxiety levels are high and people crave a soothing touch, many are deprived of even the occasional pat on the back or warm handshake at the workplace or social gathering. Even in families, the fear of passing on infection can keep you from displaying physical affection.""I began going to work before the intense lockdown, and would head straight for a shower when I returned home. My two-year-old cries when I don’t pick her up, but I am scared to even kiss her cheeks now,"" says Manoj Subramaniam, an engineer.

""When you are deprived of touch, it can affect people, especially those who are huggers. Changing a handshake to a namaste, is also new behaviour you have to learn,"" says Dr R Padmavati, director, Schizophrenia Research Foundation (SCARF) India.

What is the impact of touch starvation? ""Being starved of physical contact can have physiological effects, with the body releasing cortisol, the stress hormone. It can trigger a cascade of negative physiological effects. It can also cause problems with sleep, create a feeling of not being wanted, and augment a sense of loneliness over a period of time,"" says Dr Padmavati. Release of cortisol can increase heart rate, blood pressure, respiration and muscle tension, and can suppress the digestive system and immune system.

Family therapist Brinda Jayaraman says it can also result in emotional starvation. ""People do talk to me about how to deal with it during the pandemic. The precautions we have to take do breed anxiety but as long as you follow protocol, you needn’t be scared,"" she says.

While social distancing is an absolute must to keep the pandemic in check, people should be careful not to obsess over it. ""People who are psychologically vulnerable and have marked anxiety are more afraid of passing it on to other people,"" says Dr Suresh Kumar.

How do people cope with it? Communication is key, feel experts. ""If your loved ones are far away, a video call will help. When you talk about your feelings, it provides catharsis,"" says sexologist Dr Narayana Reddy.

Brinda feels that adults understand why distancing is necessary. ""In our society, people are not physically demonstrative with elderly people, but it is the children who will long for it and feel insecure if we don’t hug or touch them,"" she says, adding that’s why adults need to keep explaining the situation to them.

""If they show you something they have done, tell them how you feel like giving them a hug but cannot right now. Keep talking about it and they will feel safe and secure,"" says Brinda. ""And, if you have sanitised your hands and haven’t stepped out, don’t hesitate to give them an occasional pat or hug.""

MANGALURU: TikTok ban has not only led to a rise in withdrawal symptoms, but has also helped cyber-criminals chalk out new modus operandi to blackmail users.

An undergraduate student in Bengaluru has approached police after falling prey to cyber criminals . She had uploaded nearly 10,500 videos on TikTok and she was one among thousands to receive a link to download TikTokPro. With the hope of getting back her videos, she clicked on the fake app link that took control of her data and stole her pictures. She received threats that some of her content would be posted on social media, said Gagan Jain, CEO, Cybersafe Bengaluru.

He told TOI, “TikTok was a rage. Users addicted to the app are trying to see if the app is live. This practice has become an easy bait for hackers. People are searching for India’s version of TikTok which has resulted in several fake messages doing rounds,” he added.

Cybersecurity expert Ananth Prabhu G said, with any addiction comes withdrawal symptoms and in the case of TikTok, withdrawal symptoms are strong. In the current scenario, the dopamine rush happens when people get more likes, views, and comments. Huge subscribers make them celebrities overnight.

“Since the dopamine rush happens through likes and subscribers, shifting to a new platform means building a subscriber base from scratch and when most TikTok users received this TikTok Pro, an apk file, downloading it meant giving permission to access camera, gallery and microphone. Search engine analytics indicate that several people have searched for how to download banned TikTok and queries around the popular app,” he added.

Dr Ravichandra Karkal, associate professor, department of psychiatry, Yenepoya Medical College, said few apps are designed to give a surge of dopamine in the reward pathway of the brain giving an immediate gratification. Occasional use for pleasure is one thing, but a significant number of users may use it as an escape from negative emotions such as sadness, anxiety, and loneliness. Users report feeling restless and annoyed when they are unable to use the app. Youngsters should not attach their self-worth to the number of followers on these platforms.”

NEW DELHI: Even as the lockdown bulldozed businesses and robbed livelihoods, confinement helped several residents who are creating videos of Uttarakhand’s cuisine . A shared longing for the traditional “pahadi” food led them to start their channels, using nothing but household tools and operating out of their kitchens. These food vloggers say views and comments on their videos have considerably increased during the lockdown as people have been trying out the recipes with enthusiasm.

YouTuber Renu Dhatola Chilwal, 34, said she has been getting more ‘likes’ and ‘comments’ than ever on her channel even though she took a break during the lockdown due to an increased workload. “Stuck at home, natives of the hills are looking to go back to their roots,” she said.

Smita Rawat from Naugaon, Uttarkashi, said, “I cannot definitely say that my viewership has increased during the lockdown. It keeps fluctuating. It is true that many people are searching for recipes right now. However, as a lot of professional chefs have also started putting up videos, people prefer those.”

For 46-year-old Kumud Lohani , a homemaker and a food vlogger from Almora, it was the simplicity of the cuisine that had her hooked. “I moved to Uttarakhand from Uttar Pradesh after my wedding and the food seemed to have undergone a paradigm shift. The diet of the hills has none of the richness you find in common gravy-based North Indian dishes . They are simple and wholesome. Take ‘jaula’, for example. All you need is rice and curd and your meal is ready. The ingredients are also relatively inexpensive,” she said.

Experts believe there’s a reason Uttarakhand’s dishes don’t require a lot of effort and use only readily-available ingredients. Chef Samta, who works with boutique hotels across Uttarakhand that are famous for serving local cuisine, said the state’s cuisine mostly uses what grows in nature. “Most ‘pahadi’ dishes are prepared in ghee (clarified butter) or mustard oil. This is because most families in the hills used to own livestock and grew mustard seeds in farms. Some still do,” Samta said.

“It’s food for the poor,” said chef Avtar Singh Rana, a native of Tehri Garhwal who has been experimenting in ‘pahadi’ food for some time now. “You don’t have to go out of your way to cook a Uttarakhandi dish. All you need are basic spices like coriander, turmeric and green chillies. Our ancestors would have this food before going to work in the fields and stay full for the better part of the day. The ingredients having been grown in pollution-free heights, the food happens to be extremely pure and keeps you hale and hearty,” Rana said.

Pankaj Aggarwal, a Mussoorie-based chef with 30 years of experience, believes Uttarakhand’s cuisine hasn’t been promoted enough. “Not only Uttarakhand, all Himalayan states have a distinct cuisine and should be preserved in all its authenticity. A tourist in Uttarakhand is highly unlikely to find an eatery that serves local food. People of the hills should value their food culture and the government should work towards preserving it. If we start now, we can maybe get there in 10 years.”

PANAJI: Keeping with the virtual training trend during the pandemic, the department of art and culture has pivoted its conventional teaching methods to adjust for online learning, allowing students to enroll in interactive courses.

“Due to the limitations in social gatherings, there are no cultural activities. As a result, we are training our staff to opt for online classes in this time,” director of art and culture, Sagun Velip, said.

The training is aimed at how the online classes are to be conducted through social media platforms like Skype.

Velip said that the department has begun training a batch of 30 teachers since last week. Of these, 24 are almost ready to begin the online sessions while the remaining are attempting to learn the system as soon as possible.

Once the training is done, online sessions of Bharatnatyam classes, Indian classical music lessons, western music lessons, drama and art classes will commence in the state.

Prior to the lockdown, these teachers who are with the art and culture department would otherwise go from school to school teaching music, dance and art lessons to students. Throughout the lockdown, these activities by its teachers were dormant.

“Now that schools have started, and students are getting a hang of the online classrooms, we are trying to resume art and culture classes as well in the best way possible, through our online classes.” Velip further said.

The couple say that they have been living a lifeless life with hardly any visitors and no outings.

“We are confined to the house. Entertainment is confined to television, internet and reading. Our children live in other cities and we talk to them over phone,” said Gopal Krishna Kurup, who retired from Hindustan Newsprint Ltd.

He said though people are generally helpful, he has difficulties in getting some of his supplies, especially ayurvedic medicines. “We are also not able to go to banks. Shopkeepers and others deliver us provisions and medicines,” he said.

Similar is the situation of another couple in Kaloor. The man is 72-years-old, while his wife is 70.

George Korah, the secretary of Kairali apartments in Panampilly Nagar said they have 72 flats in the complex and 45% of these flats are occupied by senior citizens. They said the elderly people have adjusted to the lockdown and restrictions.

“The problem is senior citizens are forced to depend on others. Other than health workers, we do not allow visitors. The restrictions have affected their well-being. There are very healthy people above the age of 70. Why should they be confined to the house,” he said. However, he agreed that these restrictions are imposed for the safety of elderly people. “I see it in a good spirit though there are inconveniences. We have to take care of ourselves. Medicines and provisions are delivered to them regularly,” he added.

BATHINDA: The police team investigating the hacking of the Central University of Punjab ’s question bank and its keys to solve the questions has written to Proton Mail to provide the IP address from where the email might have been sent to the faculty members of the university informing them about the hacking.

The police have sent a communication to ProtonMail, run by Proton Technologies from Geneva, Switzerland, under Section 91 (summons to produce documents or similar other things) of the CrPC, under which a company is liable to provide information for investigations into crucial issues.

An email from ProtonMail server was delivered to some faculty members on Thursday from some unknown person, claiming that the question bank had been hacked. A link was also given in the mail, on clicking which the question bank and the keys would get unlocked. The faculty members brought the matter to the notice of the vice chancellor, after which a police complaint was filed.

Both investigators and university are also keeping an eye on nearly 10 students, who had got exceptionally good marks in the exams held from July 6 to 8 as compared to their previous academic performance.

Due to the restrictions related to Covid-19, the university had gone for the online option for the final semester exams.

When contacted, VC Prof R K Kohli said, “All exams, which had been held or were to be held, have been cancelled. The faculty will decide by Monday when again those will be conducted. The faculty members have been asked to prepare fresh questions. The site and the server which was compromised have been closed.”

Bathinda DSP (City-2) Ashwant Singh, who is investigating into the case, told TOI that after getting the IP address from ProtonMail from where the mail had been sent, they would proceed further in the matter.

Vehicles used for the illegal activities are also being seized. A considerable number of liquor cases are being registered on a daily basis, ever since intense lockdown in Madurai city limits was introduced.

Police teams and prohibition enforcement wing unit in Madurai city have increased vigilance to curb the illegal activity. However, bootleggers flout the rule and enter into illegal sales at nights in secluded places. According to the police officials, bootleggers stock liquor purchased from rural parts of Madurai and other neighbouring districts. The price of liquor is fixed as per the demand in the black market.

Liquor outlets in the neighbouring areas adjacent Sivaganga district too are witnessing brisk sales. “Although city police and rural police have increased police checks to curb their movement, tipplers always find ways to circumvent the checking,” a police officer from the Anna Nagar range said.

Meanwhile, residents from places like Alanganallur have started complaining of overcrowding in retail liquor shops due to the increasing number of tippers from the city. They have petitioned the district administration to close down the liquor shops there as overcrowding might result in spreading infection there.

378,['12/07/2020'],When the virtual verse goes viral,"CHENNAI: There’s a question that has been doing the rounds on social media since the pandemic broke out — can you imagine a lockdown without art? While it is rhetoric and intends to shine the spotlight on the creators of music, art and cinema during these testing times , poetry clubs across the country have found the perfect atmosphere to remind weary souls the power of the verse virtually.

Only this time, you can ruminate over the gentle wisdom of Rumi and fiery spirit of Sarojini Naidu while getting an opportunity to recite a few lines of your own, as open mics and spoken word events move online.

The Spoken Wave Festival, founded by Chennai’s Nimisha Sara Philip and Varshita Ravindranathan, was supposed to take place on a ship in Mumbai in November. But Covid-19 struck and pushed them to reimagine the platform into a virtual collaborative project that will launch soon. ""We will bring together artists from across the globe to give voice to people who have experienced abuse. The spoken word will portray their undaunting courage. We hope to hold online discussion rooms and encourage people to share their story,"" says Nimisha.

While most organisers agree that going digital with poetry sessions that rely on intimate gatherings, shared spaces and little distance between performers and audience has been tricky, it has also opened a bigger market, one that has brought world communities together. ""It would take up to a year of planning to organise a physical festival, but it takes less than a month to conduct an online event. All it needs is coordination,"" says Nimisha.

Recently, artists like Price and Indian Raga (who combine Bharatanatyam with spoken word), have gone viral, demonstrating how the online format is emerging in its own right.

Mocking Birds, a Chennai poetry club, saw more first-timers signing up for their open mics now than they ever did. Michelle Ann James , who founded it with Aashika Suresh, says this could reflect people’s need to find a voice and express themselves in an almost cathartic way that poetry enables. ""There are connectivity issues when we go live, it can be awkward to look into a laptop camera and perform for the first time, but we have overcome these glitches,"" says Michelle. ""People are finding comfort and new love for poetry. When we opened up to requests, people asked me to read A K Ramanujan, Dylan Thomas and Khalil Gibran. Some people listened to it like podcasts,"" she says.

Varun Krishnan, a law student from Kerala, used these months to take his passion for poetry a step ahead, performing at one of Mocking Bird’s sessions. ""I have always been writing poetry but the recent events have pushed me to break out of limitations, including stage fright,"" says Varun, who enrolled in a poetry workshop. ""Performing online gave me a sense of security, of coming together.""

AMRITSAR: The packaged milk industry here is yet to win the confidence of consumers, who still prefer buying loose milk from friendly “dodhi” (milkmen), who delivers “fresh” milk at their doorstep every morning after milking it straight from cows and buffaloes at his “tabela”. Although there have been numerous cases of loose milk adulteration, the packaged milk, dubbed as “made in factory” milk, remains the second choice.

Of the nearly five lakh litre daily demand of milk in Amritsar , the packaged milk had a share of nearly one lakh litre, said Verka Milk Plant general manager Harminder Singh Sandhu while talking to TOI on Saturday and added that out of this one lakh litre packaged milk daily demand, their share is over 80,000 litre.

There are several measures for checking milk adulteration with the packaged milk industry, whereas the loose milk is always at risk of being laced with various adulterants, he underlined.

In the recent past, the Punjab government had issued an advisory to all the milk processing plants on milk fortification due to prevalence of vitamin A and D deficiency.

“We are already doing fortification of double toned milk and have now begun fortification of standard milk by adding additional vitamin A and D as prescribed by the government,” he said.

However, the very idea of fortification is alien to the loose milk seller. “What is fortification? Milk itself is a complete food having all the required minerals and vitamins. There is no such need,” said Parkash Singh, a dairy owner. He claimed that the packaged milk industry would not be able to come close to them in terms of competition.

“Everyone knows that we supply fresh milk and not factory made. we have earned the faith of our customers,” said Parveen Kumar, a loose milk seller, adding that not only the loose milk, but the packaged milk is also adulterated.

Harminder said Verka would soon begin an awareness drive to make their reach to every household by holding camps in residential localities, telling people about the benefits of packaged milk over loose milk and also provide them free milk testing service.

In the first week of July, he was forced to shut one of them, located in the tony Prahladnagar area of the city. The slump in demand due to higher gold prices and a visible shift in consumer preference towards essential products post lockdown forced him to close down the outlet.“With the sharp fall in earnings it was a constant challenge to meet the high overhead costs including rent and salaries. I had no choice but to shut the shop,” said Paresh. Gold price stood at Rs 50,880 per 10 gram on Friday and has remained above the Rs 50,000-mark since early July.“Such a high price of the yellow metal is not palatable to people, who are already facing uncertainty with their jobs, business and an income shortfall. So sentimental buying of gold and gold jewellery will not take place. Only those who need jewellery for an upcoming occasion are making purchases, albeit, against exchange of old gold. Due to this, the income of jewellers has taken a big hit,” said Chirag Sheth, owner of three jewellery showrooms in Ahmedabad who was recently forced to shut one outlet on CG Road.“We were forced to reduce staff because our only way to survive was to cut costs,” Sheth added.According to industry players, many small shops in Ratanpole, Bhimjipura and Manek Chowk are yet to open doors post lockdown because sales remain insignificant. Some have permanently shut down their businesses.“These small traders were mostly dependent on sales from rural areas and job-work from jewellery showrooms. However, as demand declined, revenues began to get affected. Roughly 3% of around 5,000 small shops and jewellery making units in the city have shut their operations,” said Rohit Choksi, president, Jewellers’ Association of Ahmedabad (JAA).“If sales continue to remain low, more shops will be forced to close down,” he added.Industry sources revealed that several jewellers have laid off their sales and other support staffers to cut overhead costs.Jewellers also highlighted that since the lockdown, an increasing number of people are coming to sell old jewellery. “Many exchange old jewellery against new jewellery of the same value or more, but some are also making the exchange against cheaper jewellery and taking home the balance cash to address cash flow problems. The new jewellery becomes their safe-haven investment and the balance is liquidated,” said Chinubhai Choksi, president, Manek Chowk Choksi Mahajan.",ahmedabad,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-76919407,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-299423,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/jewellery-stores-bear-the-brunt-of-weak-gold-sales/articleshow/76916133.cms
391,['12/07/2020'],"Rudrapur roads riddled with potholes, add to the miseries of locals during monsoon","RUDRAPUR: After barely a few days of inconsistent rain, potholes have resurfaced on roads across Rudrapur. Though the Rudrapur Municipal Corporation (RMC) has claimed to have repaired roads ahead of the monsoon, most of the stretches in the city are still pothole-ridden.

The road infrastructure deteriorates due to frequent rain during the monsoon, causing potholes to widen, which invariably causes waterlogging and accidents. Locals alleged that the roads as well as rainwater drains are in a bad state.

“Whenever vehicles pass over the accumulated water, potholes are created, and with the increase in number of vehicles, the size of pothole increases,” said Sanjay Juneja, president of the traders union of the city. “Newly repaired roads, such as the Kashipur bypass and the road connecting Adarsh Colony and Civil Lines also do not have a clear and continuous drains, which causes water accumulation and later potholes are created,” he added.

“The situation of city roads is worst for pedestrians, bikers and other vehicle owners, as potholes form a major safety hazard and make them susceptible to accidents,” said Sushil Kumar Gava, a resident of Rudrapur’s Singh Colony.

The Nainital-Delhi highway, which caters to thousands of commuters going to Pantnagar industrial area, is one of the most prominent roads of the city, but it is not devoid of problems. There are potholes at several places and the worst is in front of the Dabur Private Limited.

Gava Chowk, Bhagat Singh Chowk, Bata Chowk, Agrasen Chowk and Awas Vikas Colony are most susceptible to rainwater accumulation as the drainage system in these areas has failed, said municipal councillor Ramesh Kalra . “Water accumulates up to a height of three feet at these places during the monsoon as the drainage system is blocked,” he added.

""Given the volume of traffic on the arterial roads of the city, potholes in these areas make the road susceptible to accidents. Even as the monsoon has arrived, the road remains riddled with potholes and is broken in patches. There is a threat of waterlogging as the run-off water goes to low-lying slum colonies,” Kalra further said.

Congress city president Jagdish Taneja said, ""Nothing has been done to fix the roads ahead of monsoon. We have complained to the RMC often. Potholes on almost every road of the city have become a perennial problem, exposing vehicles to risks. The roads in the city and outskirts are in bad shape and the problem needs to be addressed at the earliest.”

Avtar Singh Bisht, a resident of Metropolis Colony said, “The drainage here is blocked. This adds to woes of the residents who are not able to carry out their daily duties during heavy rains because of water accumulation.”

Long traffic jams are also frequent in the area during monsoon, said locals, due to the huge potholes and waterlogging because of the incomplete drainage system. “The drains are not clean and they fill up fast and spew water on the road,” said Gaurav Raj, a resident of Awas Vikas Colony.

Former Congress minister Tilak Raj Behar also lashed out at the RMC officials and political parties’ representatives. ""The RMC is run by BJP and the legislator is from BJP, but the city which was once known for its high-quality roads does not have a single stretch of even 50 metres without potholes. The BJP office-bearers and the local administration should understand and execute their duties well. The lives of people are in peril due to bad roads,” he said.

Meanwhile, RMC’s mayor Rampal Singh said, “Most of the potholes have been mended and 90% of the roads across the city have been fixed. With the arrival of monsoon it is difficult to regularly mend the roads. We will take the construction work at priority after the monsoon season is over.”

BAREILLY: Three siblings — one of whom was a former school teacher and another an ex-employee of a private company — allegedly hanged themselves in Lakhimpur Kheri’s Shantinagar as they were unable to cope with the trauma of their mother’s death from prolonged illness last year. The siblings — aged between 28 and 35 — had quit their jobs soon after their mother’s demise.

According to police, a suicide note found on the bodies said the siblings were “unable to bear the loss of their mother”. The two brothers, including one who was disabled, and their sister allegedly took their own lives on Friday night when their father — an engineer who retired from the agriculture department — wasn't home.

Aditya Prakash Awasthi, 60, told police his wife had died of illness in September last year. Since then, his three children Preeti (25), Gagan (35) and Pawan (30) were disturbed. While Pawan had been employed in a private company in Lucknow, Preeti was working as a schoolteacher at the time of their mother’s demise. “They quit their jobs after my wife passed away. I could not fill the void left by her death as all my children were very close to her,” said Aswathi.

When Aswathi returned home on Friday night, no one answered the door. He finally called a Dial 112 team which broke open the door. The three siblings were found hanging in the dining room.

SHO Kotwali police station Ajay Mishra told TOI that neighbours told police that the children had no contact with anyone after their mother passed away and kept to themselves. “It appears to be a case of suicide and a suicide note was also found. Bodies have been sent for autopsy.”

VISAKHAPATNAM: Tenders for the proposed redevelopment project for RK Beach funded by the World Bank are expected to be finalised by the end of August 2019.

As per the schedule, the tenders were to have been finalised by the end of May this year but were delayed by the pandemic and the subsequent lockdown. Work on the proposed project is now slated to begin in October. The project will be completed within 12 months.

The World Bank is funding the project at a cost of Rs 109 crore. The detailed project report was prepared a year ago. The Greater Visakhapatnam Municipal Corporation (GVMC), however, is optimistic that work will begin by October. “We have to meet the norms of the World Bank and have taken all measures for the project to take off,” a senior engineer at the GVMC said.

Proposed over a length of 3.5 km from RK Beach to the Park Hotel junction , the project will be executed without affecting environmental parameters and coastal regulation zone (CRZ) norms.

GVMC commissioner G Srijana told STOI that the project would include soft and hard lanscaping. Water fountains will be set up and public utilities such as toilets, bus terminals and parking lots be placed every one kilometre.

“Parking space and bus terminal will come up at Kalimata temple. Full width carriageway in the existing service road would be developed by constructing culverts in a couple of areas. Once the service road is developed, a considerable percentage of traffic can pass through this road,” the commissioner said.

Further, construction of retaining walls along the beach on a stretch of 1.5 km will also be taken up.

As per the system, heavy rainfall on Sunday and Monday may cause water to pool on some roads or in rural settlements near Panaji. Minimal traffic congestion is also likely.

IMD said impact-based forecasting is aimed at helping the city administration ascertain how the quantity of rainfall will affect local infrastructure or daily activities in the state capital.

IMD scientist Rahul M said the probability flooding or of weak structures collapsing can also be ascertained. As a result, this technique doesn’t just help in monitoring the impact of rainfall but also helps authorities take real-time decisions.

“A vulnerability map can consequently be drawn out for the area. If conditions are such that vulnerable parts may be affected, the city administration can take precautionary action.” he said.

Currently, there is an offshore trough prevailing in the Arabian Sea resulting in isolated incidents of heavy rainfall over the state. On Saturday, the highest amount of rainfall was received at Sanguem with a total of 10cm. The rain gauge stations at Pernem, Panaji, Canacona and Quepem received 8cm each.

IMD has forecast the likelihood of heavy rainfall at a few places on Sunday and Monday and very heavy rainfall at a few places on Tuesday and Wednesday.

Forest department officials said Moradabad district borders Uttarakhand’s Ramnagar, where Jim Corbett National Park is located. Wild animals easily stray out of the forest to Moradabad. There have been similar incidents before, they added.

Satendra Pawar, SHO Thakurdwara police station, said, “No complaint has been registered by the forest department. The injured have been admitted to the community health centre.""

VISAKHAPATNAM: A gym instructor in the city has come up with a different kind of fitness programme for his students at a time when social distancing has become the norm and gymnasia across the country are closed.

Every weekend, Mohan Rao, who owns a gym in Akkayyapalem, and his students take to the roads to realise their mission: Cycling 15 kilometres every day. The initiative also plans to raise awareness on the benefits of cycling and its part in keeping the city pollution-free.

Rao’s student, SV Prabhu Kumar who has cycled 41 km so far, said the exercise is a good way to reconnect with friends with whom he had no contact since the lockdown was imposed.

“Time is spent differently now. Gymnasia are closed and with the lockdown I lost contacts with my gym mates all of a sudden. This a good way to keep yourself fit and stay in touch with your friends,” said Prabhu, who works at Visakhapatnam Steel Plant .

“We are yet not sure when the government would allow us to open our gymnasium. Since end- March, my students and I are working out at home. But once the lockdown eased in May, I started motivating my students to do some cycling on the roads and set them a target – each and every one should complete 100 km within two months. The target is simple; around 15 km a day. But the fun in reconnectting is huge,” Mohan Rao, who is also the working secretary of Visakha District Gym Owners’ Union, told STOI. Rao has cycled 94 km so far and will cover the last lap of six kilometres this Saturday.

Eight of Rao’s students now take to the roads every Saturday or Sunday. Their task is simple: cover a distance of 100 km over eight days, an average of around 15 km every day.

“It is really fun to cycle on the roads of the city. Normally we take the Beach Road from RK Beach to Bheemili. Sometimes we also ride on the highway to NAD Junction and then to Simhachalam Road via Gopalpatnam ,” added one of Rao’s students, Bagathi Krishnamraju, who runs a travel business in Kancharapalem .

This led to long queues of trucks on one side of the busy road.

Bicholim PI Sanjay Dalvi and a team of policemen rushed to the spot and tried to pacify the protesters, but those agitating refused to budge. Ore transportation, however, resumed later only after truck drivers agreed not to ply on days when it rains heavily.

Former Sakhali sarpanch Praveen Blaggon, Sakhali councillor Raya Parsekar, Congress member Khemlo Sawant, former councillor Riyaz Khan and Anand Verekar were among those who blocked the mining trucks.

“Our anger is not against the truckers but against the government for permitting transportation of mineral ore along the main road during the monsoon ,” Khan said.

Trucks carrying e-auctioned ore have been plying from Sirsaim in Bardez on the Bicholim-Sakhali route towards the jetty at Amona, even as locals have been complaining about frequent traffic congestion. On Friday, despite incessant rain, the truckers continued ore transportation causing sludge to spill onto the road and resulting in several two-wheeler riders skidding and falling.

AURANGABAD: The target of carrying out 50,000 Covid-19 tests during the current lockdown may prove to be a challenge for the civic authorities given the relatively low number of tests conducted in the first two days.

The target includes RT-PCR tests, which involve the collection of swab samples, as well as rapid antigen tests in containment zones and other areas, including different entry points to the city.

Civic officials said testing capacity would be increased. “The rapid antigen tests and swab collections are going on satisfactorily. We are hopeful of meeting the target before lockdown ends,” a senior civic health official said.

Day-1 of the lockdown saw 1,947 tests being conducted, including 874 rapid antigen tests at entry points. A total of 593 tests were conducted at entry points of the city on Saturday (Day-2), whereas the exact number of tests performed in city areas could not be ascertained till Saturday evening. As per primary reports, over 1,167 tests were performed on the second day in areas other than the entry points.

Activists said the civic administration must increase daily testing capacity. “We were expecting increased testing in the containment zones first. The civic staff should focus on these areas instead of the entry points,” civic activist Rajendra Datey Patil said.

Authorities also appealed to the citizen to voluntarily come for testing.

VIJAYAWADA: The state government transferred has vice-chairman and managing director (VC&MD) of Andhra Pradesh State Road Transport Corporation (APSRTC) Madireddy Pratap. Chief secretary Nilam Sawhney issued orders on Friday night handing over the post of VC&MD of APSRTC as additional charge to principal secretary of roads and buildings (R&B) department MT Krishna Babu.

Pratap was appointed in place of Krishna Babu as VC&MD in January. He has been transferred in less than a year and the charge handed over again to Krishna Babu, who was earlier given additional charge of the post after NV Surendra Babu was transferred. On transfer, Pratap has been posted as additional director general (ADG) of Andhra Pradesh Special Police (APSP) battalions.

Breaking the convention of posting an officer of the rank of director general of police (DGP) as VC&MD of APSRTC, Pratap, an ADG-rank officer, had been given the post. The convention was followed in combined Andhra Pradesh and also after the state was bifurcated. The post of VC&MD assumes significance in view of a commonly-held belief among IPS officers that whoever gets the post is set to become the next DGP of the state.

For now, however, the convention of the APSRTC VC&MD becoming DGP has come to an end. The last such officer who went on to become DGP of the state was M Malakondaiah who held additional charge of VC&MD of APSRTC after becoming the DGP. After his retirement, NV Surendra Babu, a DGP-rank officer, was posted as VC&MD of APSRTC.

She was also the class 10th ISC topper in 2018, scoring 98.2 %.

“Even the word ‘impossible’ has ‘possible’ in it,” the Dehradun resident quoted Audrey Hepburn, while talking about her preparation strategies.

“I was tense before the exams and flustered before the results appeared like every other student. I received 100 marks in Maths, Biology and Physics and scored 99 in English and 98 in Chemistry,” Madan said.

“The Biology exam was cancelled due to the pandemic. I got 100 on the basis of the average of top three subjects and internal assessment,” she added.

Madan studied in the city’s Brightlands School. Her father Vineet Madan is head of department (HOD) in the Chemistry department at Forest Research Institute (FRI). Her mother is a teacher.

Even though she opted for both Maths and Biology in the intermediate, Madan is more inclined towards becoming a doctor.

Talking about her preparation process, Madan said she dedicated seven to eight hours to self-study every day, apart from her school hours.

Meanwhile, Sanvi Arora of Convent of Jesus and Mary in Dehradun emerged as the top scorer in class 10 ISC boards with 99 per cent marks.

LUCKNOW: There has been just a marginal rise in the number of men adopting family planning measures in the state while women still continue to shoulder the major responsibility of having fewer children.

According to state health department data , against 3,884 men adopting family planning measures in 2017-18, 5,693 men came forward in 2019-20. The contribution continues to be miniscule compared to participation of women. For every man coming forward for family planning, there were 53 women adopting the measures.

The data, released on World Population Day on Saturday, calls for concerted efforts for a paradigm shift.

Speaking at a programme while emphasising the importance of family planning during pandemic , chief minister Yogi Adityanath said population is a challenge for the state.

“There is need to bring the total fertility rate (number of children born during reproductive span) in the state to 2.7. As of now, UP’s TFR is more than the national average of 2.2,” he said adding, “The matter directly relates to the good health of women and children in the state.”

The TFR of UP is 2.9 as per the recently released Sample Registration Survey 2018.

Additional chief secretary health and family welfare Amit Mohan Prasad said the goals of population control fortnight have been included in the to-do-list of front line workers, ASHAs and ANMs.

“The front line soldiers will be providing family planning and spacing material to eligible couples during the 15-day dastak campaign starting on July 15,” he said.

General manager, family planning, National health mission, UP, Dr Alpana Sharma said the number of women adopting family planning measures in the state had increased significantly over the years.

Trend indicates that women preferred non-invasive methods such as oral pill ‘Chhaya’ and injectable ‘Antara’ over invasive methods of IUCD (copper-T) insertion.

In 2017, 23,217 women registered for Antara injections which increased to 3,45,481 in 2019-20. Likewise, Chhaya users increased from 2,13,327 in 2017-18 to 6,86,464 in 2019-20.

415,['12/07/2020'],Delhi: 700 ICU beds to be added in July,"Delhi deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia

NEW DELHI: The government is working to increase the number of ICU beds with ventilators by over 700 and most of them are likely to be added to the existing Covid-19 hospitals by the end of this month. Currently, there are 2,050 ICU beds in different government and private hospitals of the city, a major chunk of them being in Delhi government hospitals. Lok Nayak Hospital has 230 ICU beds—175 ICU beds with ventilators and 55 without ventilators, while Guru Teg Bahadur Hospital has 76 ICU beds with ventilators and Rajiv Gandhi Super Speciality Hospital 170 ICU beds with ventilators.

Deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia has asked all three hospitals to enhance ICU beds’ capacity as much as possible. “The number of existing ICU beds has already been doubled. The government is working to enhance the capacity as fast as possible,” he said. Only a few days ago, Delhi had only 1,650 ICU beds. In June, the total number was just around 1,000.

Since the increase in the number of ICU beds will need more healthcare professionals, the government has already started hiring postgraduate students from medical colleges . Interview of around 100 PG students for deployment in Lok Nayak Hospital will be completed by July 25, while GTB Hospital has already given appointment letters to dozens of students.

Currently, the city has 15,243 Covid-19 beds out of which 10,667 beds are vacant. Out of the 2,050 ICU beds, only 967 ICU beds are vacant. Since the occupancy rate of the ICU beds is far higher than the general beds, the government is now focused on increasing the number of ICU beds, which are considered critical in checking the number of Covid-19 deaths.

Medical director of Lok Nayak, Dr Suresh Kumar said that the number of ICU beds with ventilators has significantly increased in the last one month. “By the end of this month, we will be adding nearly 300 beds,” said Kumar. Earlier, Lok Nayak Hospital had only 60 ICU beds.

GTB Hospital had only 30 ICU beds in the first week of June. “We have increased the number of ICU beds to 76 and in a couple of days, 24 more beds will be added for which we have ventilators and other equipment. The target is to get 400 more ICU beds with ventilators in a few weeks,” said Vinay Bhushan, who is the nodal officer for GTB Hospital.

A total of 170 ICU beds are functional at RGSSH and the hospital administration wants to make 200 beds functional soon, said an official.

The government has already placed orders for ventilators and other equipment necessary for setting up ICU beds in the government hospitals.

“The ICU beds are being prepared to keep the infrastructure ready for emergency situations because Covid-19 is not predictable and the medical assets created now will ultimately boost the infrastructure in the hospitals,” said an official.

Administration and police officials have been pressing for a lockdown since last week of June but the decision was not taken at a ministerial level.

The situation in Solapur is critical because of the mortality rate and the continuous rise in the number of patients. The first positive patient was found in April but the city now has 3,075 Covid-19 patients. The city has recorded 296 deaths till July 10.

In the past two months, as many as 1 lakh people who were manning kitchens in hotels and restaurants in metro cities have returned.According to Chefs’ Association of Garhwal, at least three lakh people from Uttarakhand were working as chefs outside the state or abroad before the pandemic. “The number is expected to have plunged to less than two lakh now,” said Vikas Kuriyal, president of the association.In fact, a returnee chef can probably be found in every quarantine centre in the state. K S Agarwal, in charge of a quarantine centre in Dehradun , told TOI that of 16 passengers who flew in from other states and were brought to the centre on May 30, at least nine had been working as chefs in metro cities.Hotel management is a popular choice of career in the hill state which has four government-run hotel management institutes and several private ones. The colleges churn out an estimated 5,000 graduates every year.The out-of-work chefs have now sought help from the government under various employment and funding schemes to start ventures related to poultry farming and dairy. The district administration in Dehradun alone has received several such applications. Chief development officer (Dehradun), Nitika Khandelwal, told TOI that of the 2,000 applications they received in May and June, a sizable number was from those previously employed in the hotel and hospitality sector. “We have approved 39 projects in the first round,” she said, adding that preference is being given to ideas that would generate employment.Many chefs TOI spoke to said they did not want to return to cities in these uncertain times and with few employment opportunities back home, government funding for their own ventures was their only hope. “I spent six years in Delhi as a chef but my hotel closed during the lockdown, forcing me to return.

For one, in normal times, the grave is around five feet deep, and relatives are able to gently hold the body while it is lowered down. The coronavirus pandemic has led to deeper graves, sometimes 16ft deep, as a protective measure against infection. But this means the body can no longer be lowered into the grave by hand. Ambulance staff these days use ropes for this task, robbing the final rite of its dignity and solemnity.Seeing this, Qasmi, 41, decided that he would provide coffins for those who are brought to the cemetery from the hospital, trussed up in protective plastic sheets and dumped unceremoniously into the grave. The maulana contacted Fida Hussain, a carpenter in his locality of Shaheen Bagh in southeast Delhi, to plan the venture. Qasmi buys plywood from Jaitpur, and Hussain works on the rectangular boxes every morning.Qasmi has given away 85 coffins to families of Covid victims, including around 12 to members of the Christian community. “The coffins cost around Rs 2,700 to make, but I give them free to low-income families that cannot afford to buy them,” said the maulana.Graduate of Darul Uloom in Deoband and earlier a Sanskrit teacher at the Tajweedul Quran Madrassa in southeast Delhi’s Batla House, Qasmi is now associated with NGO World Peace Organisation. He has been conducting spiritual classes in Tihar Jail since 2011 “Having reading the Quran and Gita, I feel it is our duty to give the coronavirus victims a peaceful departure,” he said. “We may not be able to dress them up or spruce up their appearance, but by giving them coffins, we can ensure that they rest in peace.”",delhi,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-76917480,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-261010,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/dignity-in-a-box-plight-of-dead-prompts-coffin-drive/articleshow/76916418.cms

Their services would also be used to keep an update of those people who have been put under home quarantine, the CM said.In a video conference with the DMs on Saturday morning, CM Rawat said that surveillance has to be increased so that no one violates the norms as it can “risk the lives of others”. He said that besides the police force, the DMs should also take services of homeguards and PRD jawans, who would visit the houses of home quarantined people. A special focus would be put on major hill stations and tourist locations like Rishikesh and Mussoorie in Dehradun district, Nainital, Tehri Garhwal, Almora, and Bageshwar. The CM also asked the DMs to ensure that chief development officers take up the role of nodal officers and keep an eye on home quarantined people.Lauding the efforts of staff involved in treating Covid-19 suspects and positive cases, CM Rawat said that the recovery rate of Uttarakhand is only second to Ladakh in the country. He pointed out that special vigilance is required in the four plains districts of Dehradun, Haridwar, Udham Singh Nagar, and Nainital and thus, the authorities must conduct proper sanitisation. At present, these four districts have 473 out of total 558 Covid-19 active cases in the state. There are 85 active cases in the remaining nine districts, said the CM. He also suggested that containment zones should be made on micro-level so that monitoring work is smoothly done without causing problems to others.Meanwhile, CM Rawat directed DM Nainital to make sure that a 500-bed Covid-19 care hospital is built in the district with the help of State Disaster Response Force.On being asked about the lockdown in Kashipur, the CM said, “At present, there are around 50 active cases in the area. In June end, a wedding function was held in Kashipur and it was attended by a Covid-19 postive person. Thus, the infection spread there. Similarly, a domestic help who worked in eight houses was tested Covid-19 positive and a chain of infection was formed. Kashipur is a small town and 50 active cases is a high number.

The residents demanded that the health department perform the cremation of Covid-19 victims elsewhere.

The protesters accused the personnel of the health department of not completing the cremation of a Covid victim on Friday night, when they left the venue without completing the final rites of the deceased. Leader of the opposition in the Shivamogga City Municipal Corporation (CMC) HC Yogish, on being informed about the incident, visited the crematorium and informed the officials about the same.

Local elected representatives too, on learning of the incident, rushed to the spot around Friday midnight, and took photographs of the partially cremated patient.

“Shivamogga district administration needs to be more careful in overseeing the funeral of Covid victims. This incident is evidence of negligence on the part of the officials and the health department personnel concerned. We have seen personal protective equipment (PPE) kits that have been discarded at the crematorium,” Yogish told STOI.

Shivamogga deputy commissioner KB Sivakumar, however, dismissed the allegations of the health department staff having left the crematorium without completing the last rites of the deceased. “Shivamogga tahsildar and police were present during the cremation.

425,['12/07/2020'],Boycott China clamour leaves Delhi traders mulling options,"Over 5,000 items, from toys and lighting to fabrics and kitchenware, come to the city from China

NEW DELHI: Atmanirbhar Bharat, the call to reduce dependence on imports, may have enthused many, especially in the wake of the hiccup in India-China relations, but traders and businessmen have begun asking whether it is entirely plausible to avoid the influx of materials and products from India’s ambitious neighbour. Many Delhiites caught in this nationalistic dilemma point out that over 5,000 items, from toys and lighting to fabrics and kitchenware to cosmetics and furniture, come to the city from China.

TOI visited commercial hubs in Delhi where the Chinese presence has always been conspicuous and asked traders how the self-reliance appeal has influenced their business plans.

Sadar Bazar

Before the Covid-19 lockdown, round 300 cargo containers reached Sadar Bazar every month with Chinese toys, lights, cloth, watches and sewing machines. Those who once had shops in the Hardware & Agricultural Tools Market in Sadar Bazar shifted, in 2005, to the more lucrative business in toys imported from China as the demand for agricultural and iron products decreased.

After 15 years, these traders are again required to make some crucial decisions. “In 2005, there were six shops in Sadar Bazar selling imported toys. Today these are more than 2,000,” disclosed Sumit Matta, a toy seller. “We have logged losses due to the Covid pandemic, and now the rising din about boycotting Chinese products seems set to break our back.” Matta imported around three containers of Chinese goods every month till February, but since has barely placed orders for three.

But replacing Chinese imports will not be easy, noted Rajendra Sharma, general secretary of Federation of Sadar Bazar Traders Association. “There are some toy manufacturing units in Mumbai, but their product range is limited. Moreover, their capacity for mass production, cost of production, variety and technology are not advanced,” Sharma said. “I don’t think it is as easy to boycott Chinese goods as it sounds. As it is, each trader in Sadar Bazar has stocks worth over Rs 1 crore. Where will these go?”

Bhagirath Place

Known for its lighting-related offerings, Bhagirath Place draws huge crowds during festival time and the marriage season. But unlike most years, there are uncertainties about sales this Diwali, the busiest season in the year. They argue that the central government hasn’t imposed restrictions on imports from China, the prevailing sentiments have forced them to start looking at alternatives.

Bharat Ahuja, president, Bhagirath Market Association, revealed, “We have had meetings and discussions in groups to decide our future course. But one thing is sure, we are not going to place fresh orders.” Ahuja blamed the government’s indifference in promoting the Indian lighting business to the shutting down of all decorative light manufacturing units in Moradabad and Firozabad in UP.

Traders at the market urged the Centre to clear its stand and at least publish a list of products that cannot be imported. “We also want uniform implementation of policy for everyone, or in other words, not just for small importers but also multinational companies getting their products manufactured in China and importing them to India,” said Rakesh Yadav, president of the market association.

Karol Bagh

Gaffar Market in Karol Bagh is a popular hub for China-made mobile phones and accessories like power banks, headphones, data cables, pen drives and memory cards. There are over 5,000 shops selling phones and gadgets and 25,000 people work here. They make business into 20-25 crores every day Shopkeepers admit that 80-95% of mobile accessories sold there are imported from China and sell well because they are affordable, trendy and well-designed.

“We aren’t against the atmanirbhar movement, but if we boycott Chinese products , where can we source alternatives?” asked shopowner Bhairav Rajpurohit . “Mobile phones are assembled in India, but the raw material comes from China. Before boycotting Chinese products, we have to prepare ourselves in terms of technology, machinery and raw material sources.”

Karol Bagh’s Wholesale Footwear Association relies on China for only 20-25% of its wares, but traders feel these imports still offer better quality at lower costs than local products.

Dharampal Arora, president of the trade body, observed, “Branded shoes cost a minimum of Rs 2,000, but buyers have the option of buying shoes starting at Rs 700 that are either manufactured in India or in China. Of the latter, of course, people opt for the Chinese shoes because of their designs and quality.”

Arora said the shops had stopped orders, but will have to sell the remaining inventory.

Sarojini Nagar

“You name it and we will show it you,” declares Ashok Randhawa, president of the Mini Market Traders’ Association in Sarojini Nagar. Indeed, that market there could well adopt that line as its tagline. Though there is no guarantee about the available products, mostly from China, they are popular because of their affordability. Buyers can take home a lighter at Rs 10, a packet of needles of Rs 10, lipstick for Rs 20 apiece, mascara at Rs 60, and among other low-cost products, shoes, curtains, bedsheets, apparel, and decorative items.

While most traders are clearing their old stocks or getting earlier consignments released by Customs, they are unsure whether to place fresh orders or not. “Considering the people’s emotions, we have summoned meetings to discuss the sale of Chinese goods,” said Randhawa. “But frankly speaking, no shopper cares where the product has been made if they are low-cost.”

Kirti Nagar

The wholesale market at Kirti Nagar offer a one-stop solution for all furniture requirements. A decade ago, China made a slow but steady inroad into the market, providing furniture suitable for working couples and the younger generation. Today, it has a 30-40% share in the market. “The best part about Chinese furniture is their price, design and colours, and the capacity to fit all spaces,” said a trader.

Furniture importer Manish Khandelwal also pointed out that Indian furniture cannot usually be assembled or disassembled quickly, making it a problem when shifting house. “The products from China are available for a fourth of the Indian cost, and at that price a buyer need not worry about keeping them for a lifetime.”

The atmanirbhar call is yet to create a crisis in Kirti Nagar. “Every day, we are getting hundreds of orders for imported furniture, and can admit our sales are satisfactory,” said a store owner. “The boycott call might not impact everyone here. Only those who deal fully or in a major manner could face a dilemma.”

Tilak Nagar, Jagatpuri and Chawri Bazar

The building and construction business, concentrated around Tilak Nagar, Jagatpuri and Chawri Bazar, importing goods as small as screws, taps, bath fittings, locks, hinges, water pumps, fire doors and plastic pipes from China. “Directly and indirectly, 70-80% of what we sell in these markets are Chinese imports,” disclosed a member of the Builders’ Association of India. “Even Indian companies dealing with similar products get them manufactured in China to cut the cost of production and for bulk supply.”

He also said that the traders supported the government decision to reduce imports, but advance notice, either in the form of increased import duty or imposition of restrictions on specific products, should be given to help businessmen placing infructuous orders. “At present, orders placed three-six months ago are yet to reach us, and the prevailing situation represents a loss to us,” the member said.

Construction material sellers believe that if this situation persists, prices of such goods will eventually shoot up across the country.

LUCKNOW: Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath has appealed to NRIs from Uttar Pradesh to act as brand ambassadors and encourage people to invest in the state. Addressing a session — Atmanirbharta: Global Indians and Uttar Pradesh: A Partnership’ at the India Global Week 2020 — on Saturday, the CM said a strong law and order system was the first condition for investors to move to UP and his government had shown zero-tolerance to crime.

“The state’s perception has changed in past three years. People want security for themselves and for their investments. I assure you that both will be safe in UP,” he said.

The CM highlighted various sectors in which new investments were possible, including the defence corridor, tourism , electronic vehicle manufacturing, logistics and food processing.

“We used the lockdown to our advantage and began producing sanitizers and PPE kits. Now, we are in a position to export PPE kits. With Unlock 2 in place, we have managed to kick-start 80-90% of our industries. New policies have been brought in for MSMEs, logistic and private industrial parks,” the CM said, adding for 1,000 days, almost all labour laws had been suspended to ease setting up of industries.

The chief minister also spoke about the network of expressways in the state, airports, freight corridors, giving industry status to warehousing and launching ease-of-doing business to showcase UP’s investment potential. He added that UP was emerging as a tourism hotspot in South Asia and had the potential for religious, heritage, adventure and eco-tourism.

Yogi Adityanath said, by virtue of its population, UP was the largest market in India. He said, the state had the third largest GDP and contributed 8% to national growth with 17% Indians living in the state. “At least 56% of the population is of working age. During lockdown, almost 40 lakh migrant workers returned and we set up a Shramik Ayog and managed to place more than 11 lakh migrant workers in various industries,” he said.

The CM added that under Garib Kalyan Yojna launched by PM Narendra Modi recently, UP had provided employment to 1 crore people.

The state health department has already started increasing the number of beds and health facilities in Kolkata and neighbouring districts in the wake of the increasing demand for Covid beds in the government sector as well. Some private hospitals, too, have already started augmenting its bed capacity.Out of the 10,830 Covid beds in the government facilities, including the private units the government has acquired in the state, 2,062 beds spans across seven hospitals in Kolkata. As on Saturday, 1,402 of these beds remained occupied.“The number of Covid cases in Kolkata is higher than in other districts. Neighbouring districts like Howrah, North and South 14 Parganas are badly affected as well. Hence, the pressure is mounting on Kolkata hospitals. We are working out on how we could increase the number of beds,” said a senior health department official.Beds in Medical College Hospital Kolkata, the last to be designated as Covid hospital among the seven, are filling up fast. Almost 90% of the 500-bedded tertiary-level Covid hospital is currently occupied. While the occupancy at AMRI Annexe, Salt Lake, and Desun hospital is 100%, the occupancy at KPC Medical College is 87%, ID Hospital 82%, CNCI New Town 58% and MR Bangur Hospital is 35%.More than one third of the fresh Covid cases reported in the past 24 hours are from Kolkata.

Earlier, the government had set up safe homes to monitor asymptomatic patients who did not need hospital care to ease off pressure on hospitals.“In Kolkata the number of beds in MCH is being enhanced while the number of beds in Sanjiban Hospital has been increased from 300 to 500. We expect Narayana Multispcecialty Hospital in Howrah that has been acquired as a level IV Covid hospital with 100 beds to become functional in a day or two. The hospital was previously serving as a level II Covid hospital catering only to suspected cases,” said the health department official.Most demanded among the government hospitals for Covid treatment in the city is MCHK because of the multispecialty services involving experienced doctors. It started functioning as a Covid hospital on June 7. On Saturday, only 50 beds were vacant out of the 500 beds. According to sources in Swasthya Bhawan, health department officials wanted to covert MCHK into a full-fledged Covid hospital. But the plan was shelved owing to pressure from resident doctors and interns who wanted non-Covid services to be reopened in the hospital.Of the 9,588 active cases in the state, Kolkata has 3,280 cases, followed by North 24 parganas with 2,285 cases, Howrah 1,119 and South 24 Parganas 945 cases.

PILIBHIT: Police on Friday booked two persons for duping a 45-year-old woman of Rs 2 lakh on the pretext of sending her son to Malaysia for work.

The men arranged a tourist visa for the Ram Devi 's son instead of a work visa. The accused threatened the woman when she demanded the refund of her money.

The accused has been identified as Prempal and Harnarayan. The woman had paid Rs 1.50 lakh to the duo in three equal instalments. She had also spent another Rs 50,000 for repeated visits of the accused for visa arrangements, Ram Devi said.

Her son, however, flew to Malaysia on May 29, 2019. There he was told by airport authorities that he was travelling on a tourist visa that is valid for just three months.

Following this, Dharmendra (24) returned home immediately. On her demand of refund, Harnarayan signed an agreement to refund all her money within a month but finally retracted on December 20 and threatened her of dire consequences, the victim said.

She filed written complaints to police station concerned, the superintendent of police and even sent a copy of it DIG of Bareilly range but her FIR was not lodged, she alleged.

When STOI interacted with the residents of the villages, many agreed it would be in public interest to shift a red category industry away from the area in view of the risks it poses to the public.

Left parties have also been demanding that the plant be moved away from human habitation. Local TDP MLA PGVR Naidu (Ganababu) on Friday wrote a letter to chief minister YS Jaganmohan Reddy , requesting him to implement the high power committee’s suggestions on shifting the plant and to carry out a study on the long-term health and environmental effects of exposure to styrene.

Meanwhile, it was learn that several locals from RR Venkatapuram and its neighbouring villages have been working in the plant on a contractual basis, while some are permanent employees.

In its report, the high power committee stated that the industries and commerce department take the lead in developing industrial estates away from human settlements, with a buffer zone, especially for hazardous industries. The report mentions that every industrial estate should have a buffer zone around it, which should not be diverted for any other use.

The TOI report had also highlighted how some dealers, taking advantage of the crunch, were selling oxygen cylinders for double the price in the open market.

In fact, the Golconda police, on Saturday, even arrested a man who has been illegally hoarding oxygen cylinders and seized seized 25 cylinders from his possession. The accused, Mohammed Omer (34) had eight cylinders of 70 kgs each, seven cylinders of 40 kgs each and 10 cylinders of 10 kgs each, sourced from Gujarat. The role of Omer came to light after police, a few days ago, nabbed a person named, Ibrahim, near a government hospital in Red Hills, when he was trying to sell oxygen cylinders to people.

From Ibrahim, police recovered four cylinders. When he was questioned, Ibrahim disclosed the name of Omer, who was illegally selling cylinders from a place at Golconda. “He had been charging Rs 11,000 for a 10 kg cylinder and Rs 1,100 for refill of gas. He was arrested,” a police official said.

“Surprise checks of distributors shall be carried out periodically to ensure this and stern action will be taken if malpractices are found. Cases will be booked if the oxygen cylinders are sold at prices higher than the ceiling prices fixed by NPPA,” the DCA release stated. While TOI tried to contact the director public health, Dr G Srinivas Rao, over the issue, he did not respond. Calls made to other health officials also went unanswered.

MUMBAI: Maharashtra not only went past countries such as Germany and Canada to reach the death toll of 10,000 in the ongoing Covid-19 crisis, it also registered on Saturday its highest ever singleday tally of positive cases. The addition of 8,139 new cases took the state’s tally to 2,46,600—making up 30% of India’s cases.The state added 223 deaths on Saturday to take its toll to 10,116. It accounts for 45% of the country’s death toll of 22,123 so far. The last 5,000 deaths in Maharashtra have been added over a period of 25 days, with 1,000 deaths being added to the tally every five days.While Maharashtra on Saturday reported its highest single-day tally of cases (8,139), Mumbai, in contrast, looked slightly stable with the daily update showing 1,284 cases and 39 deaths in the past 48 hours. The financial capital's total tally is now 91,745 cases (including 22,782 under treatment) and a death toll of 5,244.Health minister Rajesh Tope chose to focus on the recoveries instead of the death toll. He said 4,360 patients got discharged on Saturday, with the state's recovery rate reaching 55.55%.

""Of the total 12.85 lakh samples tested, 2.46 lakh resulted positive,"" Tope said.Experts said that the rise in Maharashtra's overall cases is due to the surge of cases in Greater Mumbai (minus the BMC area), Pune, Aurangabad and Jalgaon. Maharashtra's peak is likely to be at least two to three weeks away, they said, while Mumbai peaked almost two months back and has now hit a plateau. The state's case fatality rate dipped a bit to 4.1% in the last 10 days from 4.49% on June 30.

437,['12/07/2020'],Vizag: Styrene leak survivors remember night of horror,"Vapourised styrene leak near RR Venkatapuram had left several dead and hundreds in hospital on May 7 this year... Read More

RR Venkatapuram: Sixteen-year-old Pinapolu Pavan, a class X student, remembers the intervening night of May 6 and May 7, when life as he knew it, changed forever. As the temperature of a tank storing styrene at the LG Polymers plant at RR Venkatapuram reached 180 degrees Celsius, vapourised styrene leaked and spread over the area, killing several and hospitalising hundreds. Pavan’s mother succumbed to the fumes and left him hospitalised for a week at King George Hospital ( KGH ), Visakhapatnam.

Two months later, Pavan and his younger brother are now in the care of their ailing grandmother. The family has received a compensation of Rs 1 crore from the state government, but grief and uncertainty mark the future. Pavan’s grandmother, A Mahalakshmi, is still inconsolable from the death of her eldest daughter.

Pavan is one among hundreds of victims struggling to come to terms in the aftermath of the styrene vapour leak . The tragedy claimed 12 lives and led to the hospitalisation of 585 people across RR Venkatapuram, Nandamuri Nagar, Kamparapalem, Padmanabha Nagar and SC/BC Colony.

When STOI visited these villages, where life is limping back to normalcy, survivors complained of symptoms of persistent fatigue, skin rashes, problems with vision and gastrointestinal issues. Memories of the fateful night — people rushing out on to the streets in panic, others falling unconscious — are still fresh.

Recounting how events unfolded, Ch Ramanamma from Venkatadri Nagar said people initially mistook the vapours to be part of the regular fogging operations of the municipal corporation. “The fumes fully enveloped the village. I partially lost consciousness and couldn’t remember how I ended up at the government-run shelter for vapour leak victims,” she told STOI.

M Apparao, an RR Venkatapuram local, said victims of the styrene leak continue to experience ailments, “even though they are currently mild in nature, long-term health effects of exposure to styrene vapour should be studied,” adding that he frequently suffered from stomach aches and body pains.

Like Apparao, Gantla Lakshmi, who spent nine days at KGH after inhaling styrene, complained of peristent weakness.

The state government recently launched a 10-bed Dr YSR Health Clinic in RR Venkatapuram to offer round-the-clock medical assistance to victims of the tragedy.

At the clinic, Dr K Santhi said oxygen cylinders and pulse oximetres are ready for patients, apart from other treatment facilities. “We have been receiving about 80 to 90 patients a day. Health cards were issued to locals of all five villages, which have a population of around 10,800. Specialist medical care will also be offered at the clinic,” Dr Santhi said.

Meanwhile, the high power committee constituted by the state government to probe into the causes of styrene leak, recommended in its recent report mentioned that a detailed study be entrusted to the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) to study the long-term effects of styrene on the health of people in the affected areas, especially the vulnerable groups of children, senior citizens and pregnant women.

Officials have observed a spike in number of applicants through Indian Council for Cultural Relations (ICCR), seeking admission in various courses.“This year the number of applications received from ICCR was more than 200 against 175 in the previous year.

439,['12/07/2020'],House parties: The new challenge in virus fight,"KOLKATA: The cops and healthcare workers in certain pockets of the city are facing a new adversary in their fight against Covid-19 — ‘get-togethers’ and ‘ house parties ’ that are termed high-risk activities as they take place in an enclosed space and make social distancing difficult.Stumped by the new-found form of recreation in the times of corona, the local administration have now been requesting residents’ welfare associations (RWA) in Rajarhat, New Town, VIP Road, New Alipore, Tollygunge and pockets of EM Bypass to keep an eye on such residents, along with taking a few other measures. In several western countries, such indoor programmes where people from different parts of the city coming under one roof has been termed as “super-spreader events”.“Contact tracing of a few people who have tested positive has revealed that they may have attended a get-together or were part of a house party. Most of them said they would stay at home most of the time and step out only to either visit a friend or a relative or attend a get-together at somebody’s place that they felt was safe,” said a doctor in a private hospital off EM Bypass. “One doesn’t know if a guest is infected but asymptomatic. Or, they are yet to manifest the symptoms. In closed environments, there are chances of more people getting infected.’With bars and night clubs shut and eateries only allowing takeaways to prevent the spread of the virus, people have not been able to meet friends and socialise. To beat the boredom, many of them are organizing high-teas or house parties during weekends to regain some of their pre-pandemic social life.Medical experts say it borders on high-risk activity. “Restaurants, movie halls and clubs have been kept shut for the same reason so that people cannot come in close proximity of each other. Even in a house party, people from different neighbourhoods are assembling under one roof. They might dance near to each other or sit across the table while eating. This helps the virus to hop from one person to another,” said the doctor.According to cops, they have received reports of several such get-togethers from different pockets of the city. “Standalone houses or those inside gated communities provide complete privacy. We are speaking to several RWAs, requesting them to sensitize their members and report to us if any activity like this takes place,” said an officer.Medical experts feel it is better to shift the activity area to the terrace or a verandah for proper ventilation. It is also preferable to sit facing the same direction rather than sitting across each other. Maintaining social distancing outdoors is easier than it is inside an apartment with many guests. This is the reason places like multiplexes, nightclubs and bars have not been allowed to open.There have been cases in other cities in the country where almost all guests attending a marriage ceremony have tested positive. In Kolkata, not more than 50 people can attend a marriage ceremony. Even religious shrines have been advised to only allow few people inside for prayers. Several places in the city have been turned into containment zones again due to the spike in cases.“People who have elderly parents or other family members with co-morbidities may be putting them at risk too. It is fine to have a couple of friends over but even then one must make sure if they reside in a containment zone or a hotspot. They may bring the virus inside the house,” said another doctor.",kolkata,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-76917461,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-199440,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/house-parties-the-new-challenge-in-virus-fight/articleshow/76915682.cms

441,['12/07/2020'],Recheck requests for English flood CISCE schools,"KOLKATA: Several city schools affiliated to the Council for Indian School Certificate Examinations have decided to approach the council for a review of the English marks after teachers expressed disbelief at the low scores that students have received in both ICSE and ISC exams. In both classes, the English exam had been conducted before the pandemic forced the suspension of other papers.Principals of several schools said hundreds of students had sent emails seeking a re-evaluation of the English paper. Some even logged into the council’s portal to make the request.According to authorities of several schools, around 35%-40% students will make the appeal. The principal of a leading school in south Kolkata said he would take up the matter with the council. “I expect that in ICSE, around 40% of my students will apply for a recheck. They are upset because they have secured 95 and above in English literature, but less than 80 in English language. In ISC, too, the English marks have taken a beating,” the principal said.South City International School principal John Bagul said several students had sent emails to the school with a request for recheck and expected about a fifth of the students to eventually do so. “There are also many who, despite being unhappy with the marks, are not seeking a recheck as they want to move on and not delay college applications further,” he pointed out.Students of Don Bosco School Park Circus have also fared poorly in English. Principal Fr Bikash Mondal said that almost 30%-40% of students from Class X and Class XII will apply for a recheck. “They are disappointed because many of them, despite being good in English and securing full marks in the other subjects, have scored in the 60s and 70s in English,” said he said.The ISC examinees are worried about the lower-than-expected aggregate queering the pitch for their college admission. Particularly anxious are those planning to pursue English in the undergraduate level as they feel students of other boards would have an advantage over them. For ICSE examinees, teachers attributed the poor marks to the change in the evaluation process. Unlike previous years, when examiners marked the papers under the supervision of team leaders and answer scripts were randomly selected to review the evaluation process, there was no vetting this year as teachers did the corrections at home.Some teachers also felt students may have fared poorly in the segment on transformation of sentence that carries 20 marks and emphasises on grammar. English teachers of missionary schools felt that perhaps it was time to change the manner in which they taught the subject.“Traditional English schools have always introduced the language through speech and auditory methods and then guided them naturally into reading texts. The idea is that the language should come to them naturally, like a mother tongue,” reasoned T H Ireland, principal of St James’ School.Over the years, the council has changed its pattern of looking at English language, felt schools and teaching the language through grammar has become imperative. “The debate about whether this is the right approach will remain. Linguistics is a specialized stream while literature can be taught from a very young age. But yes, we do have to change our old pattern and lay greater stress on grammar because you can score full marks there,” said an English teacher at Loreto House.",home,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-76917794,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1113769,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//home/education/news/recheck-requests-for-eng-flood-cisce-schools/articleshow/76915691.cms

Different subjects have been distributed among teachers to prepare the videos.“The teachers were trained by an expert linked to the field of broadcasting. He trained them in how to convert the lessons into scripts. The recording of the videos begins from July 13 at the government-owned studios at the Goa University campus. The editing of the videos will then be carried out by a separate team,” said a source.The plan to record videos for an initial period of two months, to be extended based on the Covid-19 situation. Though the duration of the sessions is still being discussed, videos are being shot in units of ten-minute sessions, keeping in mind the attention span of children, as young as six years old.Any particular subject of a certain class will be taught twice a week.“The videos will include a lot of visuals to keep students engaged. Students will also be allotted activities based on what is taught. Efforts to contact students through other online or offline methods for teaching are working well and will continue simultaneously,” the source said.The idea of the television telecast is to at least keep all students in touch with the basic concepts and expand slowly on them, even in cases where students do not have access to gadgets or internet connectivity.Many educationists, including former state board chairman Pandurang Nadkarni had earlier suggested that local Doordarshan channel should be used to telecast teaching sessions, rather than attempt to conduct classes online amidst poor internet connectivity and the lack of access of gadgets for some students.",goa,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-76920107,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-191279,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/classes-for-school-students-via-dd-likely-from-month-end/articleshow/76916448.cms

Medical experts have appealed to the people not to neglect symptoms. Fear of hospitals and lack of trust in doctors, in this time of pandemic is irrational, and a majority of the deaths could have been avoided had the patients come forth, the experts held forth candidly on Saturday.If 26 of these deaths categorised ‘Covid associated,’ occurred due to co-morbid conditions being present in the patients, four deaths have been termed coincidental Covid-19, including a patient who succumbed to liver cirrhosis. In four others, it was case of Covid pneumonia and one was a non-Covid death. Incidentally, 21 out of 35 deaths have been reported in those above 50, with those in the age-group of 60-70 accounting for 11 of them.Even in the deaths reported in those aged below 50, patients had severe co-morbid conditions, and Covid-19 only accentuated the same. The audit surmised that five of these deaths were in patients outside Dakshina Kannada district (three from Bhaktal and one each from Chitradurga and Kodagu), and the rest were residents of the district. The experts had a simple message – take care of the elderly and bring them for treatment at the first instance of illness.Admitting that while the statistics are scary, Dr Sharath Babu, one of the 13 experts, said on the contrary, the medical team at the designated Covid-19 hospital have affected 15 critical recoveries from the ICU of Wenlock Hospital. Barring the first five deaths in the district, the ICU has managed these critical recoveries in six cases among patients with co-morbidities only because they were diagnosed on time and treatment initiated promptly, he said.This reversal of Covid deaths is possible only when patients come to doctors on time, noted Dr Hansraj Alva, dismissing notions that hospitals are seeking to profit from the situation, he said that the pandemic can be handled only with patient-doctor trust. Noting that the district does not have the capacity for mass testing as of now, he said till such time is imperative for every citizen to treat self as positive, and take all mandated precautions to ensure they do not infect others.Deputy commissioner Sindhu B Rupesh said the district will receive rapid antigen detection kits on Monday. It will be used primarily to test foreign travellers who are placed in institutional quarantine. RT-PCR, that is current the gold standard front-line test for Covid-19 diagnosis will continue, she said, adding four other medical colleges in the district are expected to get their laboratories up and running soon, as directed by minister for medical education.",mangaluru,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-76914993,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-52163,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/delay-in-seeking-medical-help-increased-covid-fatalities-panel/articleshow/76914994.cms

AHMEDABAD: A Bapunagar teenager has killed herself apparently because she was dejected that her mother delivered another girl child.

The 15-year-old killed herself on Thursday. According to police sources , the girl’s mother had given birth to her fourth daughter earlier that day. The girl, a Class VIII student, had wanted a brother.

According to the girl’s father, she was a devotee of Goddess Dashama and had told her mother that this time she would surely give birth to a boy.

On Thursday, the girl was sent to her uncle’s house when her mother was taken to Civil Hospital.

At her uncle’s house, the girl sat in front of the idol of Goddess Dashama, praying for a brother. “However, news came in that another girl child had been born,” said a police official. “The girl was terribly upset.”

The girl then told her relatives that she was going to the bathroom. But she headed to the kitchen and hanged herself, using a sari. Shortly later, her uncle saw her body hanging from the ceiling.

“The family is in great shock,” the official said. “A life was born but at the same time, another ended.”

Police said no other suspicion surrounded the suicide so they handed over the body to the girl’s family after the postmortem examination. “While the mother was in hospital with the newborn baby, her eldest girl was cremated,” the official said. “We don’t know if the mother has been informed of the death of her daughter.”

Inspector N K Vyas of the Bapunagar police station said: “We have registered a case of accidental death and are probing the matter.”

(Inputs by Malathy Iyer, Sandhya Nair, Manoj Badgeri & Pradeep Gupta)

MUMBAI: The city's doubling rate for Covid-19 cases is 50 days now, said the BMC's daily update on Saturday.""A doubling rate of 50 days means Mumbai can think of further reducing the lockdown rules,"" said a doctor. From 11 days in the first week of May to 50 days is a big achievement as far as public health department's containment measures are concerned, the doctor added.Dr Shashank Joshi, who is a member of the state task force on Covid-19, said, ""If the effective reproduction number 'R' for Covid-19 reaches 1, and the doubling rate crosses 45 days, it paves the way for a smarter unlocking for Mumbai."" He said the city cannot go for complete relaxation as it could lead to a surge in cases.By comparison, Mumbai's satellite cities have poor doubling rates. The worst is 12 days in Kalyan-Dombivli, the current Covid hotspot in the region. In Thane, another municipality with over 12,000 cases, it is 20 days.The present doubling rate of Covid cases in Thane is 20 days, as 6,132 cases were reported as on May 20 that shot to 12,053 by June 9, stated latest civic records.The numbers have increased during the past month after Unlock.01 was implemented, and civic officials say they are aggressively working towards stretching the doubling rate to 27-30 days.“We are working towards identifying patients and their contacts in the early stages and treating them before they require hospitalisation. Our survey team is being strengthened,” said a senior bureaucrat on Saturday.In the Mira-Bhayander and Vasai-Virar belts, the doubling rate is 15 days and 17 days, respectively. The doubling rate at both the places was 10 to 12 days in May-end, and had increased to 17 days in mid-June. “Since the second week of June the doubling rate has been hovering around 15 days, which is worrying,” said a doctor.Civic officials are hopeful because contact tracking ratio is now 1:20 and testing has gone up. In Vasai-Virar, though, contact tracing continues to be poor.The doubling rate in Bhiwandi-Nizampura City Municipal Corporation is 23 days while in Ulhasnagar, where cases have crossed 3,000, it is 14 days.",mumbai,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-76916689,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-603388,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbais-case-doubling-rate-slows-to-50-days-but-its-12-20-in-mmr/articleshow/76916676.cms
449,['12/07/2020'],23 lakh unintended pregnancies likely due to lockdown,"NAGPUR: As a fallout of nationwide lockdown due to Covid-19 , over 2 crore couples in the country have been deprived from availing contraceptives. This is expected to result in around 23 lakh unintended pregnancies across the nation.While observing World Population Day on Saturday, the Foundation for Reproductive Health Services India (FRHS), which provides contraception and safe abortion services through multiple channels, released a policy brief to estimate the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on family planning in the country.A week before the lockdown was imposed from March 25, provision of clinical family planning services including sterilization and intra uterine contraceptive devices (IUCD) were suspended. Subsequently, ministry of health and family welfare issued a guidance advising that sterilizations and IUCD services should not be resumed till further notice.FRHS estimated the impact on family planning based on three scenarios. The best-case scenario considers that clinical family planning services will resume in a phased manner from the third week of May and will operate at full capacity from July. Under this, commercial sales of contraceptives will be impacted for 50 days and 24.55 million couples would not be able to access contraceptives this year.“This is likely to result in an additional 1.94 million unintended pregnancies, 1.18 million abortions and 1,425 maternal deaths,” the policy brief stated.Under the likely-case scenario which estimates that family planning services will resume from third week of May and commercial sales of contraceptives will be impacted for 60 days, 25.63 million couples will not be able to access contraceptives, resulting in 2.38 million unintended pregnancies and 1.45 million abortions.Apart from this, 27.18 million couples will not be unable to access contraceptives in the worst-case scenario, leading to 1.8 million abortions and 2,165 maternal deaths. This scenario considers that family planning services will resume in a phased manner from third week of May and commercial sales of contraceptives will be impacted for 75 days.To manage the effect of the pandemic on family planning, FRHS has issued some recommendations which include expanding choice for long-acting reversible contraceptives, increasing access to safe abortion services, easing restrictions for advertising and promotion of over the counter contraceptives and increasing involvement of NGO sector.“The number of live births may be actually higher, since access to abortion services have also been impacted during the lockdown period. Many women who ended up with an unintended pregnancy may be forced carry their pregnancy to term, since they may not have been able to access abortion care,” said VS Chandrashekar, chief executive officer at FRHS.Chandrashekar added that the overall adverse impact on family planning programme in 2020 is estimated to be between -15% to -23% . “The disruption in family planning services during the lockdown will result in increased demand for sterilization and abortion services once the lockdown is lifted. That can be an added pressure on our health systems and can be overwhelming,” he said.",nagpur,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-76919342,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-398184,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/23l-unintended-pregnancies-likely-due-to-lockdown/articleshow/76916167.cms

Thiruvananthapuram: They starved. Didn’t have a proper shelter to stay. Their father had abandoned them after he came to know about their mother’s illness and their grandfather was bed-ridden.

For the two kids at Alachalkonam ward at Ottasekharamangalam grama panchayat , who studied in Class I and II at a nearby government school , a meal a day was a distant dream, let alone online classes. Most days they survived eating wild fruits and slept hoping for a better tomorrow.

One day, a chance call from a volunteer to a representative at Bhavana Library , Poozhanad , changed the children’s lives, for better.

The volunteers had called to inform that the children didn’t have a television to access lessons broadcast through Victers channel. But when the representatives of the library, who have been arranging facilities for children in their region to attend online classes as part of reading month observance, visited the children’s house to verify the claim a few weeks back, they found that more than a television, the kids needed a proper house and food. They were living with their grandfather and mentally ill mother under a structure covered with plastic sheets.

Soon, they decided to renovate the structure into a proper house for the children through crowd funding.

According to Alachalkkonam ward member Cherupushpam R , the attempt to get them registered under Life Mission was not possible as they did not have any documents.

“We tried to help them financially, but the mother used to drive us away. When the library representatives approached us to help the family, we all extended our support. We took the mother to a hospital in Peroorkada and spoke to her husband who was staying at his home in Poovachal. Now, the woman, who returned after treatment, is now staying with her husband and children at his house temporarily. We recently took them to the construction site and they were happy to see the work,” said Cherupushpam.

The earlier structure was removed and the basement of the house has been constructed. “It was a pathetic sight when we first visited them. We started crowd funding to build a house and we could complete the basement work with some financial help. We hope that more people will support the initiative to complete the work so that the children can return to their house soon,” said Poozhanad Gopan, president of Bhavana Library.

The construction work began on Friday and Gopan has made an open call for volunteers who may join the work for a day or more to complete the project on time.

451,['12/07/2020'],Telangana HC upholds lecturers’ hiring policy,"Picture for representational purpose only.

HYDERABAD: Welcoming the efforts to sharpen the existing teaching methods, the Telangana high court has upheld the new policy of the state government to take only those securing high marks in PG courses as lecturers to teach in government junior colleges.

A bench of chief justice Raghvendra Singh Chauhan and justice B Vijaysen Reddy said this while dismissing a batch of appeals filed by temporary guest lecturers who wanted the government to continue them. The bench, however, made a suggestion to the government to take talented persons on a regular mode so that the education sector would see a rapid growth in the key area of Intermediate education.

“Considering the fact that Telangana is a new state it is required to pay close attention to laying the foundation of a great tradition of education,” the judges said, while making a suggestion to do away with the practice of hiring temporary teachers.

The commissioner of Intermediate education on July 25, 2018, had issued new guidelines and the government issued a memo notifying them on June 29, 2019. These guidelines specify that merit in the PG exams would be the sole criterion for hiring lecturers henceforth. The temporary guest lecturers in the meantime approached the court, seeking directions to continue them or to provide weightage to their teaching experience in the new selections.

Though a single judge stayed the government’s memo initially, his final judgement upheld the guidelines and the state policy. Aggrieved by this, the guest lecturers filed an appeal and bench headed by CJ dismissed their appeals stating that it found no legal infirmity in the state’s policy.

The judges said: “The importance of education cannot be doubted. Education is the bedrock for the growth and prosperity of any country. For, education transforms a person from a brute animal to a noble soul.”

They further said, “A country without a strong educational system would continue to live in the dark ages with a population with a closed mind. Education has been given a prominent place in the Preamble . There cannot be a freedom of speech and expression without education. It is imperative that the state should not only protect and promote, but also strengthen the education system within the state.”

Those rehabilitated will be subjected to health screening before being offered tea, breakfast and meals twice daily at the shelter homes.

Police will help the villagers with different activities like goat rearing, piggery, duck farming and beekeeping, among others. “We are also focussing on improving the roads for better connectivity of the villages,” Janardhanan said.

Police will also arrange for educational tours for students in the hinterlands. Janardhanan said they plan to send local students for educational tours within the next few months that will give them an exposure to the outside world.

In addition to this, preparations are on to hold football tournaments at the thana-level to encourage sporting activities among the youths. “Football is the most popular game in the district and police will organise tournaments at the station and district levels to keep the locals engaged in a positive manner,” the SP said.

The SP further said that every police station will have a Jan Pramarsh Kendra to sort out petty issues of the villagers. “A Jan Sahyog Samiti will be set up at the thana-level by roping in people from all walks of life. The Samiti will mediate on petty issues. They will also be our volunteers and help us in maintaining law and order in the district,” he added.

The patient can be discharged after 10 days of symptom onset and no fever for three days. At the time of discharge, the patients will be advised to isolate themselves at home and self-monitor their health for further seven days. If the patient’s oxygen saturation dips below 95% during his stay at the Covid Care Centres, the patient will be shifted to the district-level Covid hospital.Even the cases classified as ‘moderate infections’ will be discharged after 10 days of symptom onset with no testing. But this comes with some caveats. The fever should resolve within three days and the patient should maintain oxygen saturation level above 95% for the next four days without any external oxygen support. There should be complete resolution of breathlessness.If the moderate cases required oxygenation during the hospital stay, resolution of clinical symptoms, oxygen saturation levels above 95% for three consecutive days, resolution of breathlessness and normal inflammatory markers are mandatory before discharge. However, Covid testing with rapid antigen kits will be conducted on these cases. Even if the test result is positive, the case will remain under medical observation only for three days and discharged without any testing.As per an order released by the state health department, severe cases will only be discharged after being tested negative in the RT-PCR testing. The patient will be deemed ready for discharge only after meeting the clinical recovery criteria, including no fever/symptoms for the last three consecutive days before discharge, saturation levels above 95% for the last four days before discharge, normal inflammatory markers resolution of clinical signs and symptoms. If the patient tests positive in the RT-PCR before discharge, the test will be repeated after 72 hours.The mild or asymptomatic Covid-19 patients can choose the home isolation facility if they have certain facilities, such a separate room for isolation, at their homes. The remaining mild cases are currently treated at the Covid Care Centres. Only the moderate and severe cases are being shifted to the Covid-19 hospitals.

China, where the pandemic started in November, has less than half of Maharashtra’s fatalities at 4,641 so far.Maharashtra accounts for 45% of the country’s toll of 22,123 so far.It was 5,537 on June 16 when public health authorities launched a big ‘death reconciliation’ exercise following criticism that it was hiding Covid-19 deaths; 1,329 deaths were added in a single day.Barely five days after the June 16 revision, the figure jumped from 5,537 to 6,170 on June 21.The surge in Maharashtra has come from Covid clusters emerging in the satellite cities of Mumbai. Thane district (with nine municipal corporations and councils around the BrihanMumbai Municipal Corporation) recorded only 641 deaths until June 16, but the increase there has been sharp – 957 – since then. The overall Thane district toll is 1,598 so far.Mumbai has only recorded 2,077 deaths since June 16 (3,167 before that). “It is clear that Mumbai has flattened out after hitting a peak in the second half of May. Now Maharashtra is on the verge of reaching a peak,’’ said Dr Shashank Joshi, dean of the Indian College of Physicians, who is also a member of the state’s task force on Covid-19.Dr Joshi said cases are likely to continue rising at the current pace in Maharashtra for another two weeks. Proximity to Mumbai has been often cited as one of the reasons for the toll in the rest of the Mumbai Metropolitan Region. In addition, Pune, Jalgaon and Aurangabad are the areas that officials are worried about.A doctor from the state public health department, however, felt that rising numbers could also be a function of increased testing.“Maharashtra has over 110 testing facilities now,’’ said the doctor.However, another doctor said it should be checked if the rise is due to an increase in cases from areas that were unlocked.",mumbai,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-76916710,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-652710,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/covid-19-death-toll-in-maharashtra-rising-by-1000-every-5-days/articleshow/76916703.cms

MUMBAI: On the question of whether to hold the final semester exams in the state or not, vice-chancellors (V-Cs) of all state universities have dispatched a note to the chancellor seeking his advice on moving forward on the sticky issue. After several twists and turns, V-Cs decided to step up and write to the governor about the timeline of the events around the exam issue, the abrupt stalling of the academic year, the pending exams, the mandate they received from the state government from time to time and the guidelines from the UGC .

""We realised that he [governor] was not being involved in this entire process,"" a stakeholder said.

""After all, he is the chancellor, the supreme boss for us, and it is important that we keep him in the loop and follow what he asks us to do. While the state is asking us not to hold exams, the fresh UGC guidelines and the letter from home affairs make it mandatory to hold exams. We are confused and we want to seek his guidance."" There is also the possibility of people approaching the courts for justice.

""The ATKT formula is irrational,"" another stakeholder said. ""It may push someone with backlogs ahead of a candidate who has cleared all subjects on merit. Moreover, professional apex bodies have stated that they will not award practising licence to students who are not assessed before they graduate. The state has not given universities anything in writing. To move forward with the decision of not holding exams and graduating everyone with ATKT, an ordinance will have to be passed and will have to eventually be signed by the governor.""

The V-Cs seemed unhappy with the manner in which higher education minister Uday Samant has been ""mandating"" them to draw up various formulae to clear final year students, as also graduate those with backlogs.

""After forcing V-Cs and directors into all this, he held a press briefing and made it all look like it was all our unanimous decision to not hold exams and to clear candidates who have backlogs,"" a stakeholder said.In the minutes of the state-level meeting of VCs and directors, university bosses mentioned that all points were prior to any fresh guidelines from the UGC.

An unnamed senior cabinet minister was among the 2,798 new Covid cases reported across the state during the day, 1,533 of them in Bengaluru alone. The 24-hour spike was the third highest in the country after Maharashtra (8,139 cases) and Tamil Nadu (3,965). The tech capital’s overall case count stood at 16,862, with 229 deaths.

Several other cities and towns — from Maharashtra in the west to Guwahati and Shillong in the Northeast – on Saturday got either an extension or a return to lockdown. After Pune, Pimpri-Chinchwad, Thane city, Kalyan-Dombivli and Mira-Bhayander on Friday, more urban and rural pockets of the Mumbai Metropolitan Region joined the list of places where the lockdown will continue.

In the Northeast, the Assam government extended the ongoing 14-day lockdown in Guwahati and other pockets of Kamrup (Metro) district by another week till July 19.

For the Meghalaya capital of Shillong, the Covid-induced total lockdown will make a comeback for two days, beginning Monday.

Inputs by Bella Jaisinghani

MUMBAI: After restricting the height of Ganesh idols to 4 ft for mandals , the state home department has also capped the size of household idols at 2 ft, urging all to keep the festival low-key this year. A circular issued on Saturday by the department’s principal secretary Amitabh Gupta urged devotees to worship a metal or marble idol at home instead of installing the customary idol made of clay or Plaster of Paris.In case devotees do bring home clay idols, the state has requested them to carry out immersion within their premises or in artificial tanks nearby. The ten-day festival starts on August 22.The home department circular has also recommended postponing immersion till next year if possible. The period cited for immersion in 2021 is either Maghi Ganeshotsav , which is in February, or the Bhadrapad Ganeshotsav of August-September 2021.Gupta appealed to all mandals to scale down festivities to avoid crowds amid the pandemic. They have been instructed to avoid organising ‘aagman’ and ‘visarjan’ processions and make online arrangements for darshan through cable TV, websites and social media instead of encouraging physical darshan.Mandals may accept only voluntary donations, giving preference to displaying health advisories or social messages. Instead of cultural programmes, mandals are urged to organise health camps.Arrangements must be made for thermal screening near pandals and attention paid to adhering to physical distancing, use of masks and sanitisers for devotees. BMC has begun accepting online applications from July 10 from mandals who wish to erect pandals or a stage on roads and footpaths.

470,['12/07/2020'],Std XI admissions: Junior colleges to drag education dept to court,"Representative image

NAGPUR: Around 50 junior colleges from the city are in the final stages of preparing documents to drag the education department to court over the ‘centralized’ system of Std XI admissions.

On Friday, an informal group of colleges wrote to the local education officer expressing their unhappiness of admissions continuing in the ‘centralized’ mode. The group says admissions should continue via online mode but modified so that students can apply directly to colleges, rather than through the education department.

The centralized admission process (CAP) is applicable to colleges within the city limits, whereas those that are outside, deal with students directly. This has resulted in an increase in the number of tie-ups of colleges with coaching classes located just outside the city limits.

Ravindra Fadnavis, a trustee of an educational institute, is leading the agitation which is all set to land up in courts. “Our plan is to file a petition within a week before the court. In Mumbai and Pune, even junior colleges from the metropolitan area are covered. Similarly, Nagpur Metropolitan Region Development Authority colleges must also be brought under the online admission ambit,” said Fadnavis, adding, “In this way, colleges will get a level playing field.”

Students take nominal admission in colleges outside the city limits because it’s not part of CAP. “But for the next two years (XI & XII), they don’t go to college at all, and instead, spend time at coaching centres,” said Fadnavis. Many city colleges feel that they lose out on admissions because of this arrangement.

“The education department has no role to play in the admissions except for providing a common online platform where colleges can display their cutoffs. Students can then directly apply to colleges for admissions without going through the guidance centres,” said Fadnavis.

He alleged that once students land at the guidance centres opened for CAP, their preferences are manipulated. “Last year, a college got a list of 150 students who had chosen it as a preference. But only 15 took admission. Why? Who (at the guidance centre) is convincing students to change track?,” said Fadnavis.

471,['12/07/2020'],Intense monitoring at highest level was critical to our success: Rajasthan additional chief secretary (home),"Rohit Kumar Singh

Rohit Kumar Singh, the newly appointed additional chief secretary (home) and former ACS (health), tells TOI’s Syed Intishab Ali in an exclusive interview that Rajasthan has so far handled Covid-19 extremely efficiently and assured that the war on the virus will continue till everyone was safe. Excerpts

You were in charge and the key person taking crucial decisions to combat Covid-19 after the first case was reported in the state as additional chief secretary (health). How do you rate yourself in leading the crucial battle against the virus?

The battle against Covid-19 has been a dynamic learning experience and our goal has always been to ensure that no citizen is left out. Rajasthan embraced the novelty and uncertainty surrounding the virus, proactively planning and implementing bold interventions. In a state as large as Rajasthan, rapid communication channels were crucial to coordinate the response. Since guidance and notices were shared in a timely manner, problems could be addressed promptly. As cases began rising, Rajasthan launched Mission LiSa - a coordinated effort for following-up with the health of vulnerable groups (infants, pregnant women, those with chronic diseases and the elderly) in medically and socially high risk geographical areas. I owe the promising recovery rate to our frontline health workers, who worked round-the-clock to actively screen, follow-up and take care of thousands of citizens for both Covid and non-Covid concerns. Moving forward, it has been planned to digitally enable our health workforce, which will be key for longitudinal and comprehensive community-based health tracking and efficient resource deployment.

Do you think the situation is under control in Rajasthan and why?

Fortunately, Rajasthan has been doing very well compared to other states. In March, we were early to opt for a statewide lockdown and a ban on inter-state as well as inter-district travel. Later, we were the first to adopt comprehensive screening, aggressive testing, contact tracing and quarantine measures in Bhilwara, which served as an example at national and international levels. Today with our improved PCR capacity, hospital and quarantine infrastructure, we have tested 9,20,600 citizens, confirmed 20,688 cases and helped 16,278 citizens to recovery.

Now we have allowed more relaxation to people. Do you think that it is a major cause of spike in cases in June and July?

Given the highly contagious nature of Covid, relaxation is likely the cause of the spike in cases. At the same time, our surveillance measures are continuing in a dedicated manner. We are investing significantly in information, education and communication through several platforms: physical pamphlets and posters, our WhatsApp chatbot and automated, targeted, dialect specific awareness voice calls.

In the state, more than 400 people have lost their lives to the virus. Do you think that deaths could have been prevented if movement relaxations were not withdrawn?

Restrictions on movement have continued for over three months and although it has helped control the spread of the virus, it has also caused severe economic, social and health problems for people, especially the poor. Now, I believe maintaining primary healthcare access, protecting the vulnerable and educating the masses to follow safety guidelines will be most relevant for uplifting public health.

Are you satisfied with the way the state has fought against Covid including doctors, medical staff and police?

Night and day, our frontline staff went door-to-door to screen families, tested citizens and traced contacts, while our physicians, nurses and technicians ensured timely diagnosis and appropriate treatment. Overall, our health workforce has done tremendously well in balancing Covid and non-Covid care. On the other hand, police have been vital in ensuring adherence to social distancing measures and lockdown restrictions, which is a difficult task in socio-demographically challenging areas. To enable physicians address Covid and general primary health concerns in containment zones where movement is yet restricted, we have deployed mobile OPD vans.

How close we are in achieving herd immunity. Since vaccine against Covid is not available, do you think achieving herd immunity is the only hope?

Globally, the disease pattern for Covid is evolving and we remain uncertain in predicting the extent of the pandemic and its outcomes. Although many experts feel that achieving herd immunity is India’s only hope, we should continue to place confidence in vaccine trials which are being conducted in India and around the world.

How difficult was it to contain the spread of Covid in one of the biggest hotspots of the country, which is Jaipur's Ramganj area. How it was different from other hotspots in Bhilwara, Jodhpur, Bhatatpur and Pali. Did we have different strategies to contain the spread of virus in different districts?

Addressing the outbreak in Ramganj was challenging because of the sheer density of the population and the lack of adherence to social distancing and lockdown measures. For Covid response in Ramganj and other hotspots, we placed the citizens at the centre: primary health care access was ensured through mobile van deployment, essentials were delivered at doorstep and social and cultural practices were respected. Since each outbreak is unique and local knowledge is vital to appropriately address it, the state government provided general guidelines, we strongly encouraged district administration to make independent decisions based on local conditions.

Pratyusha: Always grateful to KCR, who gave me life

HYDERABAD: “I am scared. She (stepmother) is coming in my dreams.” Those were the words uttered by Pratyusha when chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao went to see her in a corporate hospital in 2015. Moved by her tear-jerker, KCR declared Pratyusha as his adopted daughter and vowed to take care of her till she is settled in her life.Five years on, 24-year-old Pratyusha, who was subjected to torture by her stepmother, has been making desperate attempts to meet her adopted father. She last met KCR on July 29, 2015, when she was invited for lunch with KCR’s family members at the CM’s camp office. Since then, neither could she meet him nor speak with him over the phone.Pratyusha, who is working as a nurse at a hospital and nursing college in Khairatabad, is keen to meet the CM to discuss her future. “I want to meet KCR garu and discuss personal issues, including my future, after he made me his daughter. I had conveyed my wish to the officials several times in the last two years.

Her intestines were damaged and it took more than six months of treatment for her to recover.Pratyusha, who had a desire to become a nurse, completed her nursing course in November 2019 and now earns Rs 12,000 a month.Interestingly, when she was invited to the CM’s camp office for lunch after she recovered from her wounds, KCR had even assured her to look for a ‘nice boy’ for her once she completed her studies.The 24-year-old says she has no problems as far as facilities are concerned.“I got Rs 5 lakh from CMRF, Rs 2.50 lakh compensation and a house was registered in my name upon the instructions of the CM.

473,['12/07/2020'],Growth of 58% plantation units dismal,"NAGPUR: An evaluation report for 3rd year plantations by the state forest department taken up in 2015 has revealed that 58% sites (97) of the 166 units evaluated show dismal growth below 40%. The report was released last month, a year after the evaluation was done.

The report number 509 published in June, a copy of which has been procured under the RTI Act, has asked CCFs to take action against staff involved in violation of norms.

The report states that of the 166 sites, only 25 (15%) have survival above 66%; 44 (27%) have survival between 41-65% and remaining 97 (58%) have survival rate of 40% or below 40%. Of these, survival at 23 sites is below 10%, below 24% at 29 sites, and below 40% at 45 sites.

In 2018-19, 166 plantation units in 3,385 hectare (11 % of total plantation) area were evaluated. The objective was to judge quality and standard of work as well as to study deficiencies. The ultimate objective is to ensure maximum efficiency in implementation and take timely steps wherever necessary.

But the report states that most of the instructions and guidelines in respect of plantations have been violated leading to failure in most of the sites. Treatment maps were not prepared in 21 sites, it stated. ACFs verified treatment maps of only 37 units (26%) & RFO verified maps of 111 units (78%). At many places, RFO did not sign treatment maps for which CCF (evaluation) recommended action for gross negligence, but none has been held accountable.

“Measurement books of plantations have not been maintained properly as per norms as well as showing grid wise details of works carried out, leading to problem to check the quantum of works in the plantation site. Such irregularities have been found in Nagpur, Chandrapur, Gadchiroli, Yavatmal , Amravati and Thane circles,” says the report.

Due to improper and poor fire protection works, 26 of the 166 units have been damaged. CCFs and DyCFs have been asked to take action for bogus casualty replacement figures shown in the records.

The report has observed serious technical and financial wrongdoings in Nagpur, Chandrapur, Gadchiroli, Yavatmal, Pune, Aurangabad and Thane circles.

Over Rs 11 crore was spent on 57 successful plantation sites, while expenditure on 62 partially successful sites was Rs13.08 crore. It also states that 62 partially successful plantations are also likely to be unsuccessful in coming days. “An expenditure of Rs 7.34 crore on 38 failed sites has become wasteful,” the report says.

“These plantation units are randomly selected and team visits the spot and does evaluation in the presence of forest officials. We have recommended an inquiry in case of failed plantations to find out reasons of failure and if required, accountability may be fixed for the same,” said CCF (evaluation) Mukul Trivedi.

However, despite repeated instructions, there does not seem to be improvement in record keeping, protection, maintenance and supervision of three years plantations taken during 2015.

With inflows in the catchment due to heavy rains, the water level in major dams in both the Telugu states is higher than last year.The upper reaches of Godavari, including Kaleshwaram, have also received copious inflows. Earlier, as water levels dipped in summer, both Telugu states had locked horns in Krishna and Godavari river management boards, accusing each other of taking up irrigation schemes without permission.The generous monsoon has made farmers hopeful of a good yield. Farmers across the two states have already started sowing seedbeds. Increasing inflows to reservoirs have also come as a relief to officials of the two states.In the upstream of river Krishna, the Almatti reservoir, which had just 40.9 tmcft of water in July last year, is now brimming with 76.6 tmcft. Water levels have already reached 1,693 ft against the full reservoir level of 1,705 ft. The reservoir has received 8,525 cusecs of inflow and discharged 1,130 cusecs as of Saturday.The situation is the same at Narayanpur reservoir, also in the upstream. The reservoir has 25 tmcft of water this year against 19.1 tmcft last July. Water level at the reservoir is already 1,605 ft against its full capacity of 1,615 ft. Srisailam reservoir has received 36.5 tmcft against 31.9 tmcft in July last year. Nagarjuna Sagar reservoir has already touched 168.5 tmcft as against 127.1 tmcft last July.Pulichintala too has raised the hopes of farmers in the downstream with the reservoir storing 7 tmcft now against 0.8 tmcft last July. The Pulichintala reservoir level is already 131 ft; it was 100 ft last year.“The monsoon so far has been good and promising. There is above average rainfall in the state. The farmers are busy with their work, the governments are busy ensuring better utilisation of the water available in the rivers and reservoirs,” said MVS Nagi Reddy, vice-chairman of AP Agriculture Mission.Due to heavy rains in the catchment areas, the water flow in Godavari is also rising. Irrigation authorities are discharging 1.21 lakh cusecs of water from Sir Arthur Cotton Barrage into the sea.

According to Andhra Pradesh State Development Planning Society ( APSDPS ), the state has received 208.2mm rainfall , 45.9% more than the normal— 142.77mm during the southwest monsoon , since June 1 till Saturday.

The excess rainfall is being attributed to active monsoon conditions such as frequent showers, favourable atmospheric conditions, low pressure and troughs along the Bay of Bengal, an IMD official said.

Speaking to TOI, K Sridhar, the joint director of the agriculture department in Srikakulam said that the current rainfall has really helped the farming sector. At present, nearly 80% farmers have taken up direct sowing while 20% went for the transplantation process, he said while adding that districts such as East Godavari, Krishna and Guntur have preferred direct sowing.

“The rainfall has come as a boon for direct sowing and is helping farmers across the state. Intermittent rains or light showers are required for the direct sowing of paddy,” Sridhar added.

481,['12/07/2020'],Mumbai: 100 files cleared for concessions in building projects,"Representative image

MUMBAI: Over 100 files seeking concessions for realty projects, pending in the municipal commissioner’s office since the lockdown in March, were cleared last week.

There are 120 files still waiting to be cleared, said municipal sources. Plans can be processed only after the concessions are approved.

“In 99% of the proposals, concession has been sought in open space deficiency. Mumbai mostly has redevelopment projects , very few are greenfield projects. Concessions are necessary for a project to be viable and for the entire floor space index (FSI) available to be utilised,” Harish Kumar Jain, vice-president, Brihanmumbai Developers Association, said.

Jain said that with fungible FSI, a redevelopment project can utilise FSI ranging from 2.7 to 3.4 in the suburbs depending on the road width. In the island city, with fungible FSI, this can go up to 4.

A key concession pertains to parking deficiency. “In several projects, it is not possible to provide parking for all flats. This is a significant concession that is needed,” architect Vilas Nagalkar said.

Nagalkar said fungible FSI and FSI concession in staircases are not granted without the commissioner’s approval though these are routine matters. “Today, nearly all files go to the commissioner. If rules are modified, then concessions that are routine can be granted at the zonal level and only a few files need to go to the commissioner,” Nagalkar said.

BJP MP Gopal Shetty had raised the issue of pending files. In a letter to the commissioner last month, Shetty had suggested a list of concessions be made and, in view of the Covid-19 situation, powers be delegated to the chief engineer (development plan) and executive engineers to approve some of these.

Iqbal Chahal took charge as the municipal commissioner in early May, when the Covid crisis was severe in Dharavi and Worli Koliwada.

Jain said construction activity had ground to a halt in the pandemic. Now, lack of labour is a challenge. “Obtaining permissions will help us assure residents that the redevelopment plans will certainly take off,” Jain said.

But while residents continue to complain about the order being flouted, healthcare experts say that the authorities haven’t done much to take these errant hospitals to task. This, in contrast to many other states where the governments have been proactive in either slapping charges against errant facilities or setting up concrete mechanisms to tackle the violation.In Mumbai, for instance, the authorities lodged an FIR against a prominent hospital for overcharging patients and even posted auditors at all private hospitals to look at the bills being generated. Back home in Telangana , the government has still not initiated any action on that front.Closer home, in neighbouring AP, the government has taken over some private hospitals (designated for Covid-19 treatment) and are treating patients free of cost under its Aarogyasri scheme. The government is not just paying for the treatment (fixed as per Aarogyasri package) but also offering Rs 2,000 in cash to every Covid-19 patient discharged from hospitals for continuing a ‘nutritious diet’.“In Telangana, however, even after the tariff cap, hospitals are billing huge amounts for PPEs and medicines flouting norms. The state government needs to directly get involved to control the bills. Else, private hospitals will continue to charge at will. Even taking over few private hospitals is an option — on the lines of AP — to plug loopholes,” said Dr M Karuna paediatrician and healthcare activist. While the state government had announced that a task force will be set up to look into the issue of excessive bills, no further action has been taken so far. Instead, the state has started appealing people to utilize government facilities instead of going to private facilities and paying exorbitant fees.“The fact that the government is not monitoring their own order shows that they are not interested in implementing the order. As a result, private hospitals are encouraged to loot patients. On the one hand they are not providing better facility in the public sector and on the other hand they aren’t monitoring private hospitals.

MUMBAI: Maharashtra anti-terrorism squad (ATS) on Saturday detained two henchmen of the recently shot dead gangster Vikas Dubey from a chawl in Dhokali, Thane. The two are accused in the killing of eight cops on the intervening night of July 2 and 3 in Kanpur when a police team had gone to arrest Dubey. The chawl where the duo was caught is a Covid containment zone.

The two have been identified as Arvind alias Guddan Trivedi, 46, and his driver Sushilkumar alias Sonu Tiwari, 30. They will be handed over to UP police on a transit remand.

Last week, an Uttar Pradesh police team went to Bikru village, Kanpur, to arrest Dubey, a known gangster in the northern state who faced more than 60 criminal cases. Dubey and his gang allegedly opened fire on the police and killed eight cops and injured several others.

On July 9, Dubey surrendered in Ujjain. The car carrying Dubey reportedly overturned. UP police said he tried to snatch a firearm to flee and was shot dead. Now, UP police have released posters of all key gang members who are on the run.

On Saturday, the Juhu unit of Maharashtra ATS led by inspector Daya Nayak got a tipoff about an accused reportedly hiding in Thane.

ATS laid a trap for Trivedi and his driver and nabbed them on Kolshet Road in Thane. The operation was supervised by ACP Shripad Kale and ATS chief Deven Bharti. No weapon was found on the two accused.

""The duo left UP on a bus and later travelled by a tempo and a truck. They first came to Pune and then went to Thane on July 7. Two brothers, in the movers and packers business, are from Guddan's village and live in Thane. Guddan sought shelter for one night. The room owner cited the Covid situation but he insisted. We got information about new faces in the area,"" said Nayak.

ATS said during preliminary inquiry they learnt Trivedi was involved in several crimes with Dubey, including the 2001 murder of state minister Santosh Shukla. UP government had announced a reward for his arrest.

The MP police, however, denied that Dubey was brought to the police station on a motorcycle or he made any escape bid.

A senior officer in the STF who was a part of the team constituted to bring Dubey to UP said: “Cops asked us to come at a police station in Ujjain but when we reached there, we were informed that Dubey had been kept at another police station. They asked us to wait. We saw a constable leaving on a motorcycle to bring Dubey.”

“When Dubey reached, he got off the motorcycle and tried to run away. When my team and MP cops caught him, he started abusing us,” he said.

Later, Dubey was taken in an SUV with proper security as per protocol and legal procedures, he said.

“We stopped near Shivpuri (MP) to check tyre air pressure and Dubey again tried to escape. But this time he was nabbed by the STF team,” he added.

A police officer at Shivpuri denied the claim that Vikas tried to escape.

NEW DELHI: Deputy chief minister and education minister Manish Sisodia on Saturday announced that state-run universities would not be conducting any exams for their intermediate and final-year students amid the pandemic.Sisodia said that holding exams in the current pandemic period would be unjust to students. “The government believes that since there was no study done for this semester, there should not be any exams. We believe what CM Arvind Kejriwal said that in these extraordinary times, we need to take extraordinary decisions ,” he added.He said the government has asked state varsities to evaluate students on the basis of previous semesters’ exams and internal assessments and also come up with progressive ways to promote students.The ones who were appearing for semester examinations should be promoted to the next semester on the basis of internal assessment and performance in mid-term exams. And the final-semester/year students should also be evaluated on the basis of previous semesters, performance in internal assessments and should be awarded degrees,” Sisodia explained.“This move will give relief to lakhs of students who couldn’t study due to the pandemic,” said the education minister.“While the issue of conducting examinations at schools was sorted out, the decision on conducting examinations at university level was more complicated,” Sisodia said. There are eight state-run universities in Delhi. Of these, AUD, IIIT-D and IGDTUW have already conducted their exams, while DTU finished off exams of its finalyear students and was in the process of conducting exams for intermediate years. “We will now assess the situation and decide on how to go about the exam procedure,” said DTU PRO Anoop Singh Lather.At IP University, exams were not announced. “With the decision of the Delhi government, the university will now decide on the future plans,” said joint registrar Pradeep Upamanyu.Earlier, there were protests by students against exams at DPSRU. “While we suspend all our exams for now, we will speak to the government as there are many intricacies involved,” said vice-chancellor Ramesh Goyal. The Delhi government order is not applicable on central universities in the capital, including Delhi University .At NSUT too, where many students have objected to holding the exams in the pandemic situation, DU is likely to go ahead with the exams. “It is on DU to decide on what they will do. Since NSUT is now a university for only a year, only firstyear students’ exams come under its purview, while all other years follow the system designed by faculty of engineering at DU,” said Sachin Maheshwari, NSUT professor.",delhi,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-76916795,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-149929,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/delhi-scraps-exams-in-state-run-universities/articleshow/76916791.cms

ROHTAK: Pooja Rani , whose father is a migrant worker from Madhya Pradesh, has scored 80.4% marks in Class X examinations of the Haryana Board of School Education, whose results were announced on Friday night. Living with parents and three sisters in a 10x10 tin shed on a footpath of an upscale Rohtak colony, Pooja says her matriculation result means a lot for her.

“Five years ago, I started my education from ‘Gandhi school’— then an informal school under a streetlight — where scores of children of migrant labourers get education,” said an elated Pooja.

Her father, Kailash Kumar, is a daily wager and mother works as a part-time cleaner in many houses. Both Kailash and his wife are illiterate and are busy most of the time struggling to earn a livelihood. “I am proud to announce today that I secured more than 80% marks and my parents are on the top of the world with joy, especially my mother who has to do odd chores like sweeping, cleaning to support the education of four daughters,” Pooja added.

“My daughters have found their lives in books,” Pooja’s father said about her exemplary Class X result and added that he finds his four daughters studying all the time — when he leaves for workin the morning and when he returns late at night.

Pooja wants to teach children of migrant labourers

The ‘Gandhi school’ is like a ray of hope for the migrant labourers in this area of Rohtak as they are slowly starting to expect that they can transform their lives through education, said Pooja, who hopes to become a teacher.

She wants to teach children like her, from families of migrant labourers, who often get behind due to lack of financial support or guidance and become uneducated adults. “If I can achieve this, then children of other migrant labourers can also do so provided they get timely help like I got at ‘Gandhi school’,” Pooja elaborated.

Naresh Kumar, a social activist who runs ‘Gandhi school’ in Rohtak, said he started this informal school 15 years ago after realizing that the children of migrant workers faced discrimination in local schools.

“Often, such children start working with their parents from a young age and are deprived of the opportunity of education and transforming their lives. I started evening classes under a street light gathering the children of migrant workers. Initially, lots of hurdles came but later people started helping us and today we have our own building where children come to study as they don’t have conducive environment at home,” Kumar explained and added that Pooja’s result had inspired other children belonging to migrant families from Bihar, UP and MP, who are studying in the school.

NEW DELHI: Searches carried out by Enforcement Directorate teams at eight locations in Delhi and Ghaziabad on Thursday on several travel agents revealed that they were processing Indian e-visas of foreigners , falsely claiming authorisation from the government, and had received remittances to the tune of over Rs 200 crore. The scam is now under investigation.

The large foreign remittances raised a security alert with agencies being asked to investigate the case as the main travel agent who carried out most of the transactions had been operating out of a very small “chawl” (jhuggi-jhopri) kind of place, explained a senior official.

The probe began after several complaints poured in against the agents from foreign nationals in US, UK, Spain and other countries who failed to get e-visas even though these operators had offered guarantees on their website for issuance of the documents based on a fake claim of being authorised by the government of India. Though there are many travel and tour operators who have been authorised by the government for processing e-visas for India, the scamsters were not the ones, said an officer.

“These entities were also involved in high value suspicious transactions,” the ED said in a press note, adding that the racket was run with the help of some chartered accountants. Officers said Rs 3.5 crore unaccounted cash was seized during the raids along with other “incriminating” documents and digital records.

NEW DELHI: Hydrogen-fuelled vehicles will have a separate identification mark as in the case of CNG vehicles for easy recognition. The identification mark will mention H2GAS in white on a red background.

The road transport ministry on Friday issued a draft notification proposing to include standards for safety evaluation of hydrogen fuel cell propelled passenger vehicles (cars and above) and trucks as well. The ministry said the standards would be in accordance with Automotive Industry Standards (AIS) 157 of 2020 till the BIS specification is notified.

This comes at a time when the government is focussing on zero-emission vehicles.

The AIS norms specify the compliance norms keeping in mind the safety requirement of these vehicles. It says, “Vehicle identification labels must be used to indicate to rescue services that the vehicle is powered by hydrogen and compressed gaseous hydrogen.”

According to the standard, the petroleum and explosive safety regulator, PESO may evaluate hydrogen cylinders based on BIS Standards. It also specifies that the hydrogen supply line must be secured with an automatic shut-off valve mounted directly on or within the container. “In the event of an accident, the automatic shut-off valve mounted directly on or within the container shall interrupt the flow of gas from the container,” the AIS standard says.

Moreover, it says that the automatic valve shall close, if a malfunction of a hydrogen system requires or any other event that results in leakage of hydrogen. “When the propulsion system is switched-off, the fuel supply from the container to the propulsion system must be switched off and remain closed until the system is required to operate,” the AIS specification says.

490,['12/07/2020'],Can’t expect witness to have photographic memory: Punjab and Haryana high court,"Punjab and Haryana high court

CHANDIGARH: The Punjab and Haryana high court has made it clear that a witness in a criminal case cannot be expected to have photographic memory . Justice Anil Kshetarpal of the high court ruled that “one cannot be expected to have eidetic/photographic memory. Natural variations do happen and such depositions are considered and relied upon by the courts after its careful analysis.”

He passed the order while dismissing a petition filed by two convicts, including a woman who was convicted along with her brother-in-law (sister’s husband) for sexually harassing her own underage daughter. The woman was living separately from her husband and had an illicit relationship with her sister’s husband, who had also tried to sexually exploit her daughter. The woman took the side of her brother-in-law when he tried to molest her daughter and even thrashed her whenever she complained about it.

The girl had filed a complaint in the public window of Chandigarh police in November 2014 after which an FIR was registered against her mother and uncle. The main complaint of the girl was that her uncle used to harass her sexually by making unwanted advances towards her.

Woman, her relative convicted by district court

She had also alleged that whenever she complained about it to her mother, she used to rebuke, beat and threaten her. The girl’s father had left the house in 2009 after a marital discord with her mother. However, after the complaint, her father and brother supported her in pursuing the matter in court.

The woman and her brother-in-law were convicted by Chandigarh district court — the man was convicted under Pocso Act and other sections of IPC and sentenced to a four years in jail and the mother got a three-year sentence.

Aggrieved by their conviction, the woman and her brother-in-law had approached the HC. In their appeal, their main contention was that there were several improvements in the statements/depositions made by the girl in the FIR, statement made under Section 164 before magistrate and the final deposition before the trial court. These improvements were regarding dates and timings of the incidents of sexual harassment and similar other details.

They argued that there were a lot of improvements in the girl’s statements and therefore, the case of the prosecution should be rejected by the court.

However, after dismissing their plea, the HC observed that it is well settled that an FIR is not expected to be an encyclopedia of the entire case of the prosecution. “An FIR is mere first information sent to the prosecuting agency for setting criminal law in motion. In these circumstances, it is wrong to expect that in the FIR, complete details of all the incidents must be disclosed. An FIR is not expected to contain the proposed evidence to be produced by the prosecution,” the HC observed while dismissing their appeal.

At great risk to their lives they performed their duties, and several died on duty. Their families must not be made to face the trouble of red tape, but must be given the compensation at the earliest. The procedural hassles for the grieving families must be done away with immediately.

MUMBAI: The state Covid-19 death toll crossed the 10,000-mark on Saturday. Among the victims who have fallen prey are many frontline warriors in civil attire—policemen, doctors, nurses, and civic employees.Of 2,198 BMC workers who were infected, 103 have died so far. On Saturday, an assistant municipal commissioner passed away.In June, BMC announced Rs 50 lakh compensation to the kin of employees who died from the disease, but family members interviewed by TOI were yet to receive the amount.Municipal union general secretary Ramakant Bane said mostly class IV staff have been infected. “Solid waste workers, fire brigade staff, health workers travelled to work in crowded buses. The BMC must ensure compensation,” he said.Imran Shaikh (32) lost his father Rafique (58), who worked at the Goregaon fire station. Rafique was involved in sanitation works that the fire brigade undertook in affected areas. Imran, himself unemployed, said, “My father was due to retire on May 31, but died on May 28.” Imran’s efforts at securing the claim have been thwarted by cumbersome formalities.License department staff Surendra Khandagale (47) was shuttled between four hospitals before he passed away last month. Khandagale was supervising the wholesale vegetable market at BKC.The men and women warriors in white coats have borne the brunt of the crisis. Ashfaq Shah (36), who ran a nursing home in Govandi, died in April. He was initially treated at his own hospital, and later shifted to a private facility. His sister Hima Shah said, “People had spread rumours about my brother having comorbidities but that isn’t true.” Dr Shah has a young son and wife.A total of 45 policemen from Mumbai have lost their lives to Covid, and 75 in Maharashtra. Many of them had no comorbidities. The state government and police welfare department started releasing compensation amounts and initiated the process of providing a job to a family member.Assistant sub-inspector Sunil Kargutkar (54) of Vinoba Bhave Nagar police station died on May 8. “My mother has gone into depression. The government is helping us. I have asked for a job in Mantralaya,” said his son Sushant.Police constable Deepak Hate (53) of Bandra police station died May 29, hours after being discharged from Worli’s Covid Care Centre.

But by the time doctors at RN Tagore International Institute of Cardiac Sciences (RTTICS) could schedule a surgery after getting all necessary permission from the state health department, the lockdown had been imposed. Then came an advisory from the Union health ministry that advocated transplant surgeries only in emergency cases in view of the ongoing Covid scenario.“We decided to conduct the surgery once we got more clarity on how to go about it. According to an SOP, both donor and recipient had to be tested for Covid. Unfortunately, both mother and son tested positive,” said nephrologist Deepak Shankar Ray, head of the nephrology department at RTIICS.Ray said: “Since the family had financial constraints, we decided to send both of them to the state-run MR Bangur Hospital for Covid treatment. It helped that the hospital has good dialysis facility, which the recipient needed while being treated for Covid.”The duo was released from M R Bangur on June 12 after they tested negative. But the doctors had to wait for another two weeks due to the mandatory home quarantine period. The transplant surgery was finally conducted on July 3.“Covid infection can prove very nasty for renal-failure patients but luckily, this patient had very mild infection,” said Ray, who conducted the surgery.Both the donor and recipient are recuperating well. While the mother will be discharged in a couple of days, the son will have to be in hospital care for few more days.“We were looked after very well at M R Bangur. None one made us feel like outsiders. They did not let us lose hope even once,” said Uttam, a private firm employee from Siraz Ganj in Bangladesh.Mother Kalpana said she was initially worried when she tested positive for Covid. “But I told myself that I had to come out of this infection because my only son needed me to infuse life into him.”The family had earlier visited a few hospitals in south India but were told that they did not accept donors above 60 years. At RTIICS, Ray and his team found that the mother’s kidney function was good enough for a transplant. The unit accepts donors till the age of 69 if the organ is fit.",kolkata,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-76917362,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-29494,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/mom-donates-kidney-to-son-after-both-win-covid-battle/articleshow/76916481.cms

MASKS ARE FOR NOSE AND MOUTH, NOT FOR YOUR CHIN!

STOP PULLING MASKS OFF INSIDE MALLS, SUPERMARKETS



Mask rule violations in numbers

Most common bahaane

It’s been just over a month since Telangana has unlocked and people have begun going out and about in the city again, but many are doing so without wearing a mask, which is mandatory. It seems Hyderabadis’ chalta hai attitude is reflecting in their approach towards wearing masks as well. Telangana police have registered over one lakh cases in the last month against people for not wearing masks in public places, with over 15000 cases being registered in Hyderabad alone. Hope is that the Rs 1,000 fine will make more people wear masks and maintain social distance, but that doesn’t seem to be happening. “People are flouting the mask rule everywhere, be it at banks, ATMs or markets,” says Anil Kumar, Additional Commissioner of Police (Traffic), Hyderabad.Police officials tell us that people come up with a range of excuses when caught without wearing a mask. From blaming the hot weather in Hyderabad to telling cops that they just forgot it at home, or that the mask is stuck in laundry....the bahaanas are endless.“Many people tell us that they don’t wear masks as they feel suffocated. ‘Helmet unappudu mask enduku bhaiyya’, they say. One youngster even told us that he didn’t wear a mask as it ruined his ‘look’,” shares M Ravi, a traffic inspector at Punjagutta.“There was another instance when I stopped a motorist. He told me, ‘Mask kharaab ho gaya, abhi mask khareedne ke liye hi jaara hoon aap pakad liye’. It’s amusing but we don’t fall for such excuses,” Ravi adds.In major street markets in the city, people can be spotted either not wearing a mask or hanging it around their chin or dangling it from an ear.Pranav Krishna, a shopkeeper in Kukatpally, says, “Masks have become like helmets in the city. People wear them only when they spot cops or cameras on roads. Just like how they hold helmets in their hand while driving, they have started putting masks in their pockets or just hang them around their chin. I am not allowing anybody to enter my store without masks.”Many are refraining from going to crowded markets going by the way people are flouting the no-mask rule. N Parthu, who works at a Pharma company in Balanagar, says, “I recently visited a store in Abids to get my phone repaired. When I went there, I saw 10-15 people crammed into a small space and many of them were not wearing a mask or maintaining social distancing norms. I left the place immediately.”Since masks are mandatory to enter places like malls, supermarkets etc, many people wear the mask while entering, but remove it once they’re inside. Vijay Anirudh, an IT student, says, “I visited a mall recently for a brief period and was surprised to see that many people decided to remove their masks after getting through the security areas. Some of them wear it below their chin or dangling by the ear or some remove it altogether. I decided not to step out after that.”1,00,000 cases registered in Telangana for not wearing masks in public places15,000 cases booked by Hyderabad Traffic Police in the last one month10,000 cases booked in city in the first 10 days of lockdownRs 1000 fine for violating no-mask rule1.5cr Revenue collected by traffic cops in Hyderabad in finesHelmet unappudu mask enduku bhaiyyaAbhi auto mein bhool gaya!Mere ko bahut suffocation hota sirIt ruins my look!...Garmi bahut hai saabAbhi mask khareedne ke liye hi jaara hoon aap pakad liye",hyderabad,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-76915937,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-121275,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/not-cool-to-take-lite-say-cops-as-hyderabadis-give-masks-a-miss/articleshow/76915937.cms

This space can easily accommodate 1,000 people and the required medical infrastructure plus a makeshift kitchen, say Cricket Association of Bengal office-bearers.Kolkata Police has been desperately hunting for a large quarantine facility after the 120 beds reserved at Dumurjola stadium were filled up. An attempt to convert the outpost at Rabindra Sarobar into a quarantine facility failed following objections from morning walkers. Lalbazar officials then turned to Eden Gardens and wrote to the CAB, seeking to convert a section of the stadium into a makeshift quarantine centre for police personnel “with immediate effect”. Work under some of the galleries started on war footing on Saturday.The space under the galleries in E, F, G, H and J blocks will be converted into a quarantine centre because they are segregated from the rest of the stadium. “The Club House and some other blocks used for administrative work and indoor sporting activities will not be used,” CAB president Avishek Dalmiya said.The past 48 hours have seen 14 fresh cases, including an East Division officer-in-charge and seven Kasba police station personnel. The force so far has logged 540 infections, of which around 125 are active; two have died and the rest have recovered.“The quarantine centre details were finalised at a meeting in Lalbazar on Friday after police officers wrote to the CAB. It is our responsibility to help the administration in this hour of need,” Dalmiya said.Board of Control for Cricket in India president Sourav Ganguly on March 25 offered the stadium’s indoor facility and the players’ dormitory to the state government for use as a temporary medical centre. “We will hand over the facility if the government asks us. We will do anything that is the need of the hour. There is absolutely no problem,” Ganguly had said.Doctors attached with major city hospitals who are members of CAB medical committee have offered help in the quarantine facility.

Despite the exorbitant rates of vegetables, they were sold out within hours, said vendor Ravi Kumar Singh. “The cost of brinjal, beans, tomatoes and other vegetables is extremely high owing to shortage in supply. But that did not deter the customers from buying them in hordes,” added Singh who owns a vegetable shop at Jugsalai.
