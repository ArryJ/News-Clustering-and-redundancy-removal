Not surprisingly, the videos of these gigs are being generously shared on the internet over the past few days. Quarantined but in high spirits, people around the world are making the making the most of their stay-at-home time by inspiring people to hope for a safer, disease-free world.As part of his address to the nation, Prime Minister Narendra Modi requested all Indians to take 5 minutes out of their proposed self-imposed curfew, at 5 pm this Sunday, on March 22, to clap for the many people in the service industry who are bending over backwards to try and curb the spread of this pandemic. This is quite in line with the way a few other countries have shown their gratitude for the exact cause recently.In several countries, citizens applauded the efforts made by doctors to contain the virus and treat the sick. Safa Zouaoui shared a special video from Geneva, Switzerland, and wrote: “#Geneva — #switzerland ????9pm, 15/03/20 — the whole town is clapping for its INCREDIBLE medical staff. You are our heroes! #thankyou.”People in China have reportedly chanted the phrase jiayóu, which roughly translates to ‘add oil’ — meaning keeping up the fight or staying strong.Despite being one of the worst-hit countries by the coronavirus disease, the self-isolated folk in Italy are entertaining their neighbours by crooning popular numbers from their balcony. In one such video, which is making the rounds on social media platforms, a man projected a popular Fred Astaire song onto his neighbour’s wall, and it got an elderly couple up on their feet, waltzing to it. An aww-inducing moment, indeed.And there’s more! In one housing complex in Rome, people flashed laser lights and put up a community disco session. Meanwhile, opera singer Laura Baldassari took part in a session in Milan. Sharing her experience, the artiste wrote on her Instagram: “Last Friday I decided to join ‘The singing’ flash mob from my window in Milan. I did it for all who are fighting coronavirus around the world and also for all who lost someone due this terrible virus — to drive away fear, even if we are crying, like in the words of ‘Lascia ch’io pianga’ (from Rinaldo by G.F. Handel), we won’t give up! It’s fundamental to go ahead, to look beyond, to be close to our family and our friends. (sic).” In other countries, musicians are making the most of their EDM consoles, electric guitars, saxophones, trumpets and harps by putting up lively balcony music fests.YouTuber Brian May Tribute recently shared a video of him playing We Will Rock You from his balcony, as his neighbours cheered for him. He wrote: “During this terrible period, each day at 6 pm all Italians play something on their balcony. In Rome, in my condominium we played We Will Rock You! Big hug all around the world.”In Seville, Spain, people in an apartment complex have begun playing bingo from their homes, and are even doing morning workouts together. Meanwhile, in Barcelona, neighbours played ping pong standing at their respective windows. Yet another netizen shared a video of him playing a quirky version of Pac-Man, which involves wearing a sock on one’s hand, sitting at the window and pretending to eat up all the cars that pass by. How creative, isn’t it!In Lebanon, communities are coming together to celebrate birthdays from balconies. Posts shared on social media include that of people cutting cakes at the balcony, while their neighbours sing happy birthday from their homes.While the videos of Italians singing together trended world over, it didn’t quite work well for funnyman and popular TV show anchor, Trevor Noah. When he started singing A Whole New World from the balcony of his New York apartment, someone yelled back at him, saying, “Shut the F*** up!”Back home, comedian-actor-anchor, Danish Sait had to face a similar situation in Bengaluru. Standing at his balcony, Danish started singing The Lion Sleeps Tonight, to which someone responded with a ‘shut up’. Sharing his experience on social media, he said, “Beautiful feels! Trevor Noah, apologies for being a copycat.” Danish’s video got many laughing, including actor Dulquer Salmaan, who wrote: “hahaha this is epic!

And now, to ensure that those at home stay motivated to follow this plan, artistes from across various locations are coming together to entertain people with a Janata Curfew Online Festival. Pianist Anil Srinivasan wrote on his social media pages, “I call out to all musicians, dancers, poets, writers, performers, visual artistes — on my list here and elsewhere — to share and engage audiences creatively all day Sunday on Facebook or Instagram live. Stand-up comedians, theater professionals — come on y’all. Let’s do this. Let’s use art to connect with one another, and share of our best — and keep folks engaged, but off the streets.”Within minutes, Anil’s post saw a lot of confirmations from some big names in the field, including Sudha Ragunathan, Bharat Sundar Pravin Godhkindi , Rajesh Vaidhya and Manasi Prasad. More names are expected. Each of them, we hear, will be allotted a time slot to ensure that netizens are entertained throughout this curfew.",entertainment,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74731821,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-198539/74731821.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/kannada/music/artistes-and-entertainers-unite-for-a-janata-curfew-online-festival/articleshow/74731747.cms
2,['21/03/2020'],Performing arts industry on brink of collapse amid shutdown,"Theatrewallahs are familiar with cancellation of their plays due to technical glitches, bad weather or even violent protests, but a viral epidemic is as unforeseen for them as it is for most quarters of life today. In an industry where ticket sales are critical to its survival, suspension of shows for an indefinite period, say those in the know, may leave an impact that cannot be reversed soon.With all major venues already closed and smaller spaces following suit, the theatre community is in a state of dilemma, says Mumbai-based actor-director Sunil Shanbag. “Nobody knows for how long the pandemic will continue. We are figuring it out along the way. My worry is the long-term effect on the sector, which already has a precarious existence,” he adds.In fact, such was the dilemma about whether to have shows or not that a staging of the late Girish Karnad’s last play, Road to Talikota, at the National Centre for the Performing Arts was called off just hours before it was to start last weekend. “It was a heart-breaking moment for the entire troupe. This was our first tour in the country after the play premiered in Bengaluru last year. Obviously, the team has incurred losses in terms of hotel and flight bookings. But again, people from all age groups come to watch theatre. So, cancelling the show was the right decision,” says actor Shashank Purushotham.Amid postponing and rescheduling of shows, maintenance staff at Bengaluru’s popular theatre hubs, Ranga Shankara and Jagriti, have doubled the number of times they clean the seats, door knobs, railings and other ‘contact’ surfaces each day, while sanitisers are being placed wherever required. “Even before the government mandate was announced, footfall had started reducing drastically. Performances, which under normal circumstances, would run a full house, had a handful of people in attendance. Currently, some troupes have asked for alternate dates, while others have requested for refunds. We are accommodating these requests accordingly,” says Arundhati Nag , co-founder of Ranga Shankara.Actor-director Atul Kumar is currently self-quarantined in his Mumbai residence, ever since he returned from Europe, after the Oslo International Theatre Festival got cancelled. Shows of his play, The Lesson, scheduled to take place at the Prithvi Theatre in Mumbai were also called off. But he feels that theatreincurring losses due to the cancellations is irrelevant at the moment. “The common people who inspire our plays, be it the vegetable vendor on the road or a daily-wage worker, are at a greater risk of catching the disease,” Atul says, adding, “Bringing 500 people together inside an auditorium, just because the show must go on, and putting them all at risk, will be an act of social irresponsibility.”According to Jagriti’s artistic director Rebecca Spurgeon, while local acts and in-house productions are stalled temporarily, performances by international artistes might get pushed by a year. “Refunding tickets has been logistically challenging,” she says, adding, “The online booking system, however, has helped us track most of the ticket buyers, and we are trying to refund as best as we can.”“To ensure that students do not miss out on academics, we are planning to conduct classes and workshops digitally. At the same time, we’re also considering the fact that many students hail from remote areas of the country, where internet accessibility is a challenge. Nevertheless, we’ll try our best to execute the plan,” says Abhilash Pillai, Dean (Academics) at the National School of Drama (NSD).Actor Ashwath Bhatt, who travels to Germany every year to conduct theatre and clowning classes at different universities there, says that all plans have slipped out of gear. “This year, I was scheduled to conduct acting and clowning workshops in Konstanz. I was also collaborating with German designer, Timo Dentler, and was supposed to go for the opening of an exhibition in Ulm, in May. I don’t think either of that will work out now,” he says, adding that the schedule of his play Eidgah ke Jinnat, which was to begin in Bengaluru next month, is also uncertain now.Why not take his workshops online, then? “Theatre is a community art form. I am not sure how far online workshops can be helpful for students. Voice and speech sessions may work out to a certain extent, but not all modules,” he says.In a rather quirky take on COVID-19, the narrative of a popular Tamil play, Chocolate Krishna, has been altered a bit to incorporate references of the disease outbreak, and the importance of social distancing. Actor Maadhu Balaji says, “People in Tamil Nadu often use the terminology ‘god promise’ in their conversations, while also placing one’s palm on that of the other person. There is a scene in the play between lord Krishna and a man and in a dialogue between them, they say ‘god promise’, and avoid physical contact, adding ‘don’t touch’.”",entertainment,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74732245,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-185975/74732245.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/kannada/theatre/performing-arts-industry-on-brink-of-collapse-amid-shutdown/articleshow/74732155.cms
3,['21/03/2020'],I’ve huge respect for the mridangam; it’s versatile: Bickram Ghosh,"I have spent most of my career trying to break the myth that tabla is a mere accompaniment to a musical ensemble — the tabla is the most versatile musical instrument in the world,” begins Bickram Ghosh , acclaimed tabla maestro, on his recent trip to Chennai for a concert. “Its capacity to produce sounds using techniques that are diametrically opposite is amazing. A pair of tabla is like the yin and yang,” he continues. The sahitya or literature associated with the drum goes back to over 100 years when music was very hierarchical, and “the tabla bore the brunt of that. It is being broken; before Zakir Hussain’s generation, my dad (Pandit Shankar Ghosh) broke it, now, I am doing it. Twenty years ago, right here at the Music Academy, I had the tabla sitting in the middle,” says Bickram, “We are in the age of the emancipation of the tabla — it is everywhere, tabla artistes are popular like never before — and the world thinks of it as an instrument that fits in everywhere.”“The mridangam is my second favourite instrument,” smiles Bickram, “but only because I am a tabla player. The mridangam is also extremely versatile, has incredible content, and in the southern part of India, you cannot do without the mridangam. I’m so taken with it that I learnt the intricacies of the mridangam on the tabla, and I try to I swap around the sounds. I have huge respect for the mridangam,” he says, “India is a powerhouse of drumming. It’s not just a folk tradition here, it’s a classical-cum-folk tradition — so you have a huge gamut of drums that arefolk drums, many of which have become classical drums over generations.”But why are there no takers for tabla among the younger generation? “Professional tabla playing is not a very old tradition. But there are exceptional talents out there. I just hope they have the vision and find the voice to break the box,” opines Bickram, “Some spend their lives fitting in, some fitting out. I’d have done some 1000 shows with Pt Ravi Shankar and could have continued to do so, but I wanted a signature. Like for instance here, you had U Shrinivas... he could carry the mandolin’s resonance much further because he had it electricalised. So, breaking the mould is essential to make a mark as a musician.”But aren’t multi-sound electrical instruments and the percussion making traditional instruments like the tabla redundant? “See, I’m onto scoring music for my 35th film now, and I know what programming music is about — how instead of an 80-piece orchestra, one guy is sitting and downloading all the sounds. I am currently doing a film called Avijaatrik — it’s an opportunity to go totally acoustic, which is a pleasure. I have always believed, and now I am convinced — you cannot replace these instruments. We probably have a generation who grew up listening to electronic sounds — virtual instruments — the sounds imitated on a keyboard or iPad. But I believe in energy flows. You sit in front of a person playing the tabla or the sarod — you see his movements, see him sweating, the person’s hand, his energy — how can you swap all that? It can be done, but it will never be the same experience,” explains Bickram passionately.“Virtually simulated tabla sounds are not good,” he continues, “It cannot be replicated. I have a handsonic, but the other day, I was telling the Roland (instrument makers) guys that hopefully, in my lifetime, you won’t do enough research to replicate the exact sounds — right now, it’s nowhere near. So, if it’s a Madonna track — go ahead and use the handsonic; you don’t need a great player there. But how are you going to replicate a Umayalpuram Sivaraman or a Karaikudi Mani with a virtually simulated mridangam? It’s impossible. A machine may do it faster, but it can’t substitute,” Bickram signs off.",entertainment,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74733154,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-908475/74733154.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/tamil/music/ive-huge-respect-for-the-mridangam-its-versatile-bickram-ghosh/articleshow/74733154.cms
4,['21/03/2020'],It’s sequel time on Kannada television,"The franchise formula, it would seem, is not solely monopolised by cinema, what with television serial makers also jumping on the bandwagon. It is no surprise, then, that sequels are the current flavour of Kannada television. Cashing in on the popularity of the original installments, a host of sequels are currently on air, namely Naagini 2, Mangala Gowri Maduve , Silli Lalli and Kavyanjali 2, are in the works. Talking about this trend, popular television director and producer KS Ramji, says, “The advantages of sequels is that there is an already established set of viewers who have appreciated the content and narrative. As a maker, the challenge is to keep audiences engaged with a fresh narrative. For Naagini 2, which is a sequel to Naagini, we have erected grand sets, and have employed making standards that are on par with cinema, so that the visual grandeur also becomes a talking point, beside the story and the performances by the cast, which includes Namratha Gowda, J Karthik and Mohan. When sequels go on air, we need to ensure the audiences are ready for it. For instance, when Putta Gowri Maduve was still on air, the characters made references to Mangala Gowri Maduve, so when the sequel came, eventually, it did not come as a surprise to viewers. Given that the titles of sequels are generally similar, people will make comparisons between the original and the new version. So, it is up to the makers to ensure that the series lives up to that title.”Weighing in on the pros and cons of making a sequel, actor, director and producer Sihikahi Chandru , adds, “Generally, only those serials that had a good run in its first installment are picked for a sequel, so it generates immense expectation among audiences. Though, the actors are different, the essence of the serial remains the same. Since audiences already know what to expect from the serial, we don’t need to start from scratch and explain everything. The challenge with this is that they will compare the new version with the old one. If we fail to match up to the expectations of the viewers, it will reflect in the TRPs. When we zeroed in on Silli Lalli to bring back as a sequel, we knew it would work because the earlier version was a popular comedy series about 15 years ago and today’s generation is not accustomed to the kind of humour that was popular back then. That gave us the platform and bandwidth to introduce them to an already appreciated brand of humour.”The challenge, though, is not only about keeping up the intrigue in the narrative; it is also about ensuring that the casting right. Like the case of Prabhu Raj , who stepped into the shoes of Silli Lalli’s Dr Vittal Rao, earlier played by Ravishankar Gowda . He says, “When you play a character that has already been made famous by another actor, there is always a sense of fear whether you can make it work. As an artiste, you can learn about what worked for the earlier version and appealed to audiences. You then need to build on that and reach out to viewers in your own style,” he signs off.HOW SEQUEL SERIALS HAVE FARED ON TELEVISION * Naagini 2: The fantasy drama serial about a female snake seeking revenge for the death of her lover topped TRP charts in its first week.* Mangala Gowri Maduve: A social drama that revolves around child marriage continues to impress viewers, much like Putta Gowri Maduve.* Silli Lalli: A retelling of the old series, packaged for Gen Now viewers, its comedy element seems to have struck a chord with audiences. Paapa Pandu 2: Although audiences looked forward to the return of Paapa Pandu, the series could not sustain the momentum and was recently taken off air.* Muktha Muktha: The sequel to Muktha, it attempted to address the issue of Naxals, farmers and medical system.

The gangster-drama features actor-filmmaker Rishab Shetty and Raj in lead roles. “As the title suggests, the film alludes to Lord Vishnu and Lord Shiva. This narrative traces the journey of two people, who get into rowdyism by mistake, but use it for power play and dominance eventually,” says Raj, adding, “Inspired by Lord Vishnu, one of the lead characters is a calm and calculated person, who knows how to handle every situation. The other person is a far more impulsive character, who has no control over his actions. He is inspired by Lord Shiva.”Currently, Raj is working on the music for the movie with composer Midhun Mukundan . “Set in Mangaluru, those familiar with the region’s underworld scene will be able to relate to it. Having said that, the film is not based on a real-life story,” explains the filmmaker-actor.Actor Gopalkrishna Deshpande plays a pivotal role in the movie, which also features actors like Prakash Thumminad , of the Ondu Motteya Kathe fame, as well as a bunch of newcomers.

7,['21/03/2020'],Kannada television industry braces for shutdown amid COVID-19 crisis,"In the days since the government announced a partial shutdown, requiring people to stay at home as far as possible, the Kannada TV industry has been trying to figure out how to work around it. Considering that a large chunk of programming on general entertainment channels are daily soaps and reality shows, many of which are in production on most days, a complete shutdown would seem unthinkable. Yet, that is exactly what is going to happen this coming week, when the Kannada TV industry shuts down from March 22 to 31 to help prevent the spread of the coronavirus pandemic. Shooting for both fiction and non-fiction shows will be halted for a week.Business head of a general entertainment channel, Parameshwar Gundkal says, “As of now, we have enough stockpile of episodes to tide us through till the end of the month. Also, we have been allowed to continue shooting with minimal crew until March 21. Thereafter, we have to cease all production work. If the situation does not get better by March 31, we will schedule repeats of earlier episodes to keep things running.”Raghavendra Hunsur, business head of another channel, adds, “This is a first for us, so, naturally it is quite a challenge. There are some shows that have enough episodes ready to see us through this phase, but there just as many that do not have that luxury. For these shows, we will continue to shoot with minimal crew till Saturday and with all necessary precautions.”Actor Vivek Simha, the leading man of Mathe Vasantha, has just wrapped up shooting a few episodes in Mysuru. “As Mathe Vasantha is a new serial, we didn’t have enough back-up episodes, so we worked on a few. On the set, every one wore masks and liberally used hand sanitisers to maintain hygiene. We also realise that more than providing entertainment to the people and raking in revenue, human lives are important, so, we decided to wrap up the shoot as per the directions.”With only two days to go before the complete shutdown, producer Shruti Naidu wants to make the most of it to bank episodes. “We are trying our best to shoot as much as possible in the next couple of days. If that doesn’t see us through to the end of the month, we will have to hit pause and resume the show when the situation gets better.” Guruprasad Mudenahalli, the director of Paaru, is hopeful that the shutdown will not affect his team as they have enough episodes ready to air till the end of the month. “If the situation continues, though, there will be a problem,” he says.The team of Jothe Jotheyalli has rarely missed an opportunity to incorporate a social message into its narrative and the current scenario has also been used. In the most recent episodes, emphasis has been on social distancing, personal hygiene, and how and when to consult doctors if there are symptoms of having Covid-19. Actor Aniruddha Jatkar , who plays the lead on the show, says, “Television has a wider reach and with a viewership across all age groups. It is our responsibility to do our bit for society and we thought it was apt to incorporate information about the spread of the virus and what it can do to us in our narrative.”President of Kannada Television Workers Association , S V Shivakumar, says, “At this juncture, the health of people is paramount, so, we have decided to shut down shooting of all shows of television from March 22. The livelihood of people working as light boys, makeup artists and those in technical departments will be affected. We are looking at working out a compensation package for them, which will be discussed at a meeting with all stakeholders, once the situation eases.”",tv,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74730967,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-147330/74730967.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//tv/news/kannada/kannada-television-industry-braces-for-shutdown-amid-covid-19-crisis/articleshow/74730972.cms
8,['21/03/2020'],Fahadh in light-hearted role in Akhil Sathyan’s debut,"What sets Fahadh Faasil apart from many is arguably his versatility, not only when it comes to selecting his roles but also in terms of performance. After choosing intense characters such as Joshua Carlton, the faith healer in Trance , and Sulaiman, the leader of a coastal community in Malik, the actor has now picked a role that lets him tap into his comic prowess.In his upcoming film, which is directed by Sathyan Anthikad ’s son Akhil, the actor will be seen essaying a role that has a huge scope for humour. “It’s a lightweight character,” says Akhil. “Fahadh plays a middle-class Malayali youth who is settled in Mumbai. The movie revolves around incidents that take place on a journey to Kerala. In a bird’s eye view, this is an entertainer but at the heart of it, it’s a story between a young girl and an older woman, and how Fahadh’s character connects them both.”The movie has three heroines – Anjana Jayaprakash , Viji Venkatesh and Dwani Rajesh – apart from Innocent, Vineeth and Vijayaraghavan, who form the supporting cast. Fahadh was scheduled to join the team in the beginning of the month, but had to postpone. “He had a lost a lot of weight for Malik and looked really slim. He also had some reactions to medicines and needed time to recover. We wanted him to put on some weight again to look his part for our film. In between, he was also busy with Trance promotions. Right now, we have a shoot ban due to the Covid-19 situation; so, once that is cleared, we will resume production,” says Akhil.The team though had shot a few portions of the second half in slums in Mumbai. “These scenes didn’t require Fahadh. A lot of newcomers are also part of the film including theatre artistes from Mumbai and Pune. We have edited the portions that we have shot,” says Akhil, who is also serving as the film’s editor.Another main location of the film is Goa. Ask the filmmaker if it’s a road movie and he says, “We don’t stress on the travel of the character much, even though the location changes.

9,['21/03/2020'],#CoronaScare will not hinder television channels’ schedules until March 31,"The #CoronaScare has not just altered the plans of Kollywood , but the television industry, too. While all film shoots have been stopped on March 15, television shoots, too, have been suspended from March 19. But the good news is that many channels have shot footage for the next two weeks, and so, television audience needn’t worry much as they can still continue to watch their favourite serials at home.A spokesperson from Zee Tamil tells us, “As per the advisory by the Indian Motion Pictures Producers’ Association (IMPPA), we have decided to halt all shoots across our fiction and non-fiction shows until March 31. This decision has been taken in the interest of the safety and welfare of our artistes and technicians. All our shows on the channel will run as per schedule.” We hear that the team will be running original episodes for the next two weeks.A source close to Colors Tamil informs us that they have content till the first week of April. The source adds, “The team has shot for episodes that can last till the first week of April. So, it really shouldn’t be a problem. On weekends, they will telecast serials that have been dubbed and play movies.”Vijay Television, too, has content for the next two weeks. A source in the know says, “They won’t be starting any new shows. The on-going ones will be telecast as per the schedule. The reality shows, too, have been shot for the next few weeks. So, the viewers needn’t worry about watching repeated content.” Of course, the channel will be telecasting movies over weekends.The talk show, Nerkonda Paarvai aired on Kalaignar television, too, has been shot for the next few weeks, says a source. The source adds, “That’s the advantage in television serials/shows as they shoot footage for three or four weeks. If the lockdown goes beyond March 31, then they will have to think about it.”We also hear that several serial artistes have gone back to their hometowns and taking a break during this time. A director of a popular serial says, “We take bulk dates from all the artistes every month. So, we usually shoot and keep footage in advance. Ever since we heard about #CoronaScare, most serials have shot a lot of content, especially in the last four days. So, we won’t really have a problem until this month end. If it goes beyond March, channels will take a call.”",tv,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74733085,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-1443647/74733085.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//tv/news/tamil/coronascare-will-not-hinder-television-channels-schedules-until-march-31/articleshow/74733085.cms

11,['21/03/2020'],Music Review: Master,"Master Anirudh RavichanderMany masters have come together to make a musical medley, which is what Master audio tracks are all about. It’s got actors and composers singing, directors writing lyrics, folk overtones, percussion, many traditional instruments and drummers beating the life out of a variety of drums. Anirudh Ravichander, the film’s composer, has tried to do more of the same (Petta, Darbar...), and yet built in a few refreshing tunes.Like this one — Kutti Story. It’s mostly just drums and a voice in a lyrical tango with each other. If you think about it, the whole album is all drums mainly, with even the singers taking a backseat at times. But not Kutti Story — it lets Thalapathy Vijay’s voice stand out, with Anirudh ably backing him. The kuthu beats are rustic, and director Arunraja Kamaraj’s lyrics simple. Hummable.The next one, Vaathi Coming, with lyrics by Gana Balachandar, and sung by him and Anirudh make quite some noise. Percussion, drums, dhol all beat fast and furious. But the shehnai and flute calms the frenzy a bit — this seems to be a Petta-ish action BGM, perhaps Vijay’s making an entry as this one plays on? The track’s a long-drive mate.Andha Kanna Paathaakaa is the next song, a romantic one, in the unmistakable nasal tones of Yuvan Shankar Raja. You might think it turns a bit monotonous, but the fun and catchy lyrics rescue it from that fall, and the techno beats add to YSR’s tenor. Chumma listen.Quit Pannuda, a drunken stupor song, sung by Anirudh, is penned by Vignesh ShivN. It starts with the ‘plop’ of a bottle being opened before trumpets and noises take over, but thankfully, settles down into a soft rock. Guess this one is for that one preachy moment in all Vijay’s films — perhaps about quitting drinking? Sing along, though!Next is the short and snazzy Beat of Master — the instrumental mastered by Anirudh. Definitely gotta be an action interlude, where Vijay’s thrashing the goons. Polakattum Para Para, with lyrics by Vishnu Edavan, is a bit of a letdown. Santhosh Narayanan could have upped the game quite a bit. But do listen to that voice (Vijay Sethupathi has said that’s not him!) in the beginning. If you love strange rusticity, this one’s for you.Then comes Pona Pogattum — penned by Vishnu, sung by namma Ani and CB Vinith — the kid’s voice is refreshing, though the beats do sound a little off-the-track. Kids might like this one. And now, for Vaathi Raid — this is the actual biggie of the album, the Petta Paraak overtone is unmistakable. It’s the rap track to which Anirudh has given it his all! Lyrics are by Arivu, and he’s also sung it along with Anirudh. It’s got the sounds, the speed and the lyrics just right — giving you that adrenaline rush. The thing is, this track brings to mind images of Rajinikanth gearing up for the big fight in Petta!! So, we’ll have to wait for the movie to get the Vijay feel!But the masterstroke is, Vaathi, in Tamil, means Master. A drumroll to that one, now!",entertainment,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74732965,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-931200/74732965.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/tamil/movies/news/music-review-master/articleshow/74732965.cms

NAWANSHAHR: Deputy commissioner Vinay Bublani on Friday issued prohibitory orders for mandatory ‘home quarantine’ making violation of its conditions a punishable offence following the death of a Covid-19 patient in the town.

Bublani said immediate steps were required to check the spread of Covid-19 and as an emergency measure he was issuing the order under section 144 of the CrPC directing that the guidelines of home quarantine shall be strictly followed.

Bublani appointed district nodal officer Vipin Bhandari for enforcing home quarantine and assigned a police team to assist him.

The list of all such persons in home quarantine will be published on the website (nawanshahr.nic.in) by the nodal officer, the order read.

“An apprehension has been raised that some people will not adhere to the home quarantine. Thereby endangering public safety. Any breach of this order would invite action under Section 188 of the IPC (Disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant),” the order read.

The order shall remain in force from 5pm on Saturday effective for a period of 60 days.

14,['21/03/2020'],When PK got a taste of coach’s ‘vocal tonic’,"Panaji: Syed Abdul Rahim rarely lost his cool. The legendary India coach was calmness personified even when his team was down, but on that evening in Jakarta, he couldn’t control himself in the dressing room.

Up against Japan in what was essentially a must-win game to qualify for the semifinals of the Asian Games in 1962, India found themselves locked goalless at the half-way stage. India had lost the opening game against South Korea and then bounced back with a 4-1 demolition of Thailand, but against Japan things were simply not going their way. To top it all, PK Banerjee , the star forward, was misfiring. In the dressing room, he started vomiting.

“Coach Rahim saab walked up to PK and inquired about his condition. PK didn’t have a good first half, so the coach knew something was amiss. PK said he wasn’t feeling well and had started to vomit. The coach really lost it,” recalls Fortunato Franco .

At five-feet-nine-inches, Franco was a lean midfielder from Tatas and an important member of that Asiad squad. He had also noticed that PK was not his usual self, but Rahim’s reaction in the dressing room surprised everyone.

“The coach told PK that he should have alerted him about his condition, that he wasn’t fit enough to play this crucial game. He gave him a piece of his mind and said there were others on the bench who were ready to step into his boots,” said Franco.

The tough words from Rahim had the necessary impact on the star forward. Less than 10 minutes after restart, PK scored India’s opening goal, his third of the competition, as Tulsidas Balaram scored the insurance goal for a 2-0 win.

Of course, PK went on to score another famous goal in the final against South Korea, while Franco provided the assist from a freekick for Jarnail Singh to score the second as India claimed a famous Asian Games gold medal in Jakarta with a 2-1 triumph over the crowd favourites.

“PK was a terror for rival defences. He was blessed with speed and a terrific right-foot. Those days, PK did 100m (sprint) in about 11.01 seconds, something remarkable for a footballer. With that kind of speed and a lethally accurate shot, those who were marking him had little chance,” said Franco, who played alongside the India captain at both Olympics (1960, Rome) and Asian Games (1962, Jakarta).

PK himself went on to become a famous coach. From the time he took over the coaching role in 1970, he was undoubtedly one of the most sought-after coaches in India for the next 30 years. Mohun Bagan and East Bengal both won triple crowns under his tutelage, and those who have trained under him swear by his ‘vocal tonic’ before any important game. He could get the best out of his players with words alone, and in that game against Japan in 1962, he had first got a taste of that medicine.

BENGALURU: The railways has increased the platform ticket price from Rs 10 to Rs 50 at five railway stations to restrict crowds due to Covid-19. But some passengers have already found a loophole to enter these stations at a lesser cost.

As the minimum fare of a passenger train ticket is only Rs 10, many people are now entering railway stations after buying it.

The price of a platform ticket at KSR Bengaluru City , Cantonment, Yeshwantpur , Yelahanka and Krishnarajapuram railway stations has been fixed at Rs 50 till March 31. Officials say sales of platform tickets in these stations have reduced up to 40% after the hike.

“It is unethical to enter a station with a passenger ticket of Rs 10 but we are helpless. The idea of increasing platform ticket prices was to restrict crowds. An unreserved ticket can be bought only an hour before the train arrives, but some passengers are buying random tickets of any passenger train headed to any direction or time,” said an official at KSR Bengaluru City railway station.

While the validity of a platform ticket is two hours, it is three hours for passenger tickets.

SWR officials said they will crackdown against those buying passenger train tickets to enter railway platforms. “Ticket checking staff at the station entrance can check passengers based on train timings and luggage,” said SWR chief public relations officer E Vijaya.

Railway activist Krishna Prasad said, “The number of passengers travelling in trains has reduced after the Covid-19 outbreak. Only those who are in emergency are going to the stations. It is not illegal to enter a station with a passenger ticket and he/she can decide whether to go to that destination or not. The hike of platform ticket is also very steep.”

BENGALURU: Transport services are likely to be disrupted in Bengaluru city and elsewhere in the state during the Janata Curfew on Sunday. While Namma Metro will shut down services, BMTC and KSRTC will be running only skeletal operations.

Other transport services, including app-based cabs and autorickshaws , too will go off the roads as most drivers’ associations will take part in the curfew.

The nationwide Janata Curfew will start at 7am and end at 9pm.

“BMTC is a public transport service provider and an essential service and it will operate its buses on Sunday. However, the operations will be reduced based on the public response,” a BMTC official said.

“If there is reservation after 9pm on Sunday, only then will we operate bus services,” said a KSRTC spokesperson.

When contacted, Uber in a statement said:""In line with the Government’s advisory, we urge riders to observe the ‘Janata Curfew’ on Sunday, March 22. However, we will offer services to meet the essential and urgent travel needs of the communities we serve"". Ola refused to comment.

Tanveer Pasha, a representative of cab drivers, said: ""We will strictly follow the guidelines to fight back to the looming threat of Covid-19. Services like Ola and Uber auto and cabs won’t be available on Sunday”. C Sampath, general secretary, Adarsh Autorickshaw Taxi Drivers' Union, said: “Autorickshaws won’t ply since most auto rickshaw associations have extended the support”.

Indian Railways will be disrupted between 7am and 9pm on Sunday. “All passenger services trains originating between Saturday night and 10pm on Sunday shall not run. All long distance mail/express and intercity trains originating between 4am and 10pm on Sunday will be cancelled,” the railway board said in a notification.

Fuel outlets will remain open.

BENGALURU: Starting Saturday, Metro trains may not stop at crowded stations. Also, passengers aged 60 and above and children below 10 will be barred from boarding the trains.

To ensure social distancing, BMRCL on Friday said each train will accommodate only 150 passengers, leaving alternate seats empty. No commuter will be allowed to travel standing. It has also advised passengers to maintain at least one-metre distance from each other while approaching a queue for security scanning , purchasing tickets and entering AFC gates and platforms.

“Trains may not stop at crowded stations, where the expected distance of one meter between passengers is not possible,” said BMRCL chief public relations officer BL Yashavanth Chavan.

However, it’s still unclear which stations would be skipped.

The BMRCL urged passengers to use Metro only for essential and unavoidable travel. “The train service is to be made available on priority to personnel who are required to maintain essential services,” said Chavan. Also, random thermal scanning of passengers would be carried out at stations. “Skipping of crowded stations will come into play only if social distancing isn’t followed,” Ajay Seth , BMRCL managing director told TOI.

22,['21/03/2020'],"Coronavirus: Pvt offices, non-essential services shut in Mumbai, Pune","MUMBAI: On a day the number of Covid-19 cases in Maharashtra crossed the 50 mark, CM Uddhav Thackeray ordered the shutting down of all private offices and shops and establishments that provide non-essential services in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region , Pune, Pimpri-Chinchwad and Nagpur till March 31.This shutdown came into effect from Friday midnight.

While public transport like buses and trains will still remain operational, the state has appealed to people to reduce crowds on these services. All government offices will also work with 25% attendance, down from the 50% that was being implemented from Thursday. The state government had earlier in the week asked private offices to run with 50% staff.

“I am aware many people may not like this decision, but the number of positive coronavirus cases in these cities is going up. Despite repeated appeals, crowds in local trains and buses have not reduced,” Thackeray said in a live video address on Friday. Thackeray said the government was reviewing these crowds, and if they didn’t reduce, a decision to stop trains and buses would have to be taken.

Those exempted from the lockdown are establishments providing essential services like drinking water, sewerage services, banking services, telephone and internet services, railway and transportation services, food, vegetables and groceries, hospitals, medical centres and medical stores, the media, electricity providers, ports, oil refineries, petroleum and the IT sector providing for any of these essential services. Production and manufacturing units required for the functioning of these essential services will continue to work at 50% staff strength.

Also exempted are stock exchanges, clearing corporations, stock brokers, depositories and SEBI-registered participants operating through these institutions.

The government has empowered municipal commissioners in these areas to take a final decision in case of doubts whether a certain establishment is essential or not. If anyone violates the order, action can be initiated under Section 188 of the IPC , which provides for a six months’ jail term or a fine of Rs 1,000 or both.

The CM also appealed to employers not to cut wages of staff during the lockdown period while urging people not to venture out of their homes. “This is not a holiday. These are restrictions,” he said.

Both the bride and groom are said to be closely related to a politician who holds a post that bears state cabinet rank.Besides this, the uncle of the groom is said to be a well-connected lawyer from the district. Among those attending the function were VIPs, including a women’s leader who holds sway in the party governing the state. When officials in the CM’s office found out about the wedding, they had the reception, scheduled for Friday, stopped.Warangal police commissioner V Ravinder said, “We have ensured that the groom goes back into home quarantine.”Residents of Warangal, however, said the wedding was among many still taking place in the city despite the Covid-19 outbreak. Several large events were reported on Friday as well. The Telangana government has allowed weddings to be held till March 31, with restricted guest lists. All marriage halls have been instructed to shut down at the end of the month.

Each zone has been delegated the power to decide on the number of trains they want to allow on Sunday.PM Narendra Modi had on Thursday appealed people to implement a “janata curfew” on Sunday by confining themselves to their homes for 14 hours, beginning 7am. Although the PM suggested that it was up to people to observe the “curfew” voluntarily, the decision of the railways to scale down services on world’s second largest network to the skeletal level, led many to wonder whether the Sunday exercise was a preparatory drill for a larger shutdown if that becomes necessary.According to the order, no passenger trains (excluding suburban services) will originate from any railway station in the country from Saturday/Sunday midnight to 10pm on Sunday, which will translate into cancellation of nearly 2,400 trains.“However the passenger train services already on run at 7am on Sunday will be allowed to run to their destinations. Divisions should keep a watch and trains which are empty could be short terminated, if required,” it said.All long distance mail/express and intercity trains originating between 4am and 10pm on Sunday will also be cancelled. Their numbers are estimated to be approximately 1,300 trains. “However trains already on run at 7am on the day (Sunday) will be allowed to run to their destinations. Divisions should keep a watch and trains which are empty could be short terminated, if required,” the order said.The Board issued directions to all zones to ensure that the passengers already travelling in trains or arriving at stations during the shutdown don’t face any hassles. It said passengers alighting en route stations from trains already on run and those willing to stay at stations may be accommodated in the waiting halls, waiting rooms and concourses without creating crowding.“Adequate arrangements may be made to facilitate hassle-free refund to passengers affected by train cancellations,” the order said. It also delegated power to the divisional managers to run special trains, if there is a need to clear rush.The “social distancing” campaign, which PM Modi has termed as “janata curfew” will be observed from 7am to 9pm on March 22. He appealed to citizens, barring those in essential services, to not get out of their houses.The ticketing and catering arm of railways, IRCTC on Friday issued an order to its five group general managers to close food plazas, refreshment rooms, jan aahaar and cell kitchens till further orders from Sunday. It also said that the on-board catering services in mail and express trains should be closed. It asked its vendors to “take care of their catering staff on humanitarian grounds” during this closure.Amid reports of some states having ordered cancellation of other modes of public transport, particularly buses, road transport ministry officials said they were not issuing any directions. “States can take decisions as per their requirement,” said an official.",india,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74739997,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-289301,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/janata-curfew-3700-trains-cancelled-on-sunday/articleshow/74740006.cms

NEW DELHI/LUCKNOW: The coronavirus scare reached Parliament and even Rashtrapati Bhavan , with BJP MP Dushyant Singh and with his mother, former Rajasthan CM Vasundhara Raje , going into “self-quarantine” after attending a party in Lucknow last Sunday where singer Kanika Kapoor, who has since tested positive for Covid-19, was also present.Raje’s tweet on Friday declaring that both she and Dushyant had been to the party where Kapoor, back from London, was also a guest sent many parliamentarians into a tizzy. Dushyant has been attending the House, spending time in the central hall and also attended a breakfast meeting hosted by President Ram Nath Kovind , who has cancelled his appointment for the next few days.The meeting with Kovind on Tuesday was for MPs from Rajasthan and UP and a photo released by Rashtrapati Bhavan showed Dushyant greeting the President and standing next to other MPs. Attendance has been high in Parliament and the central hall has also been fairly crowded with MPs and journalists.Dushyant also attended two other private gatherings with friends in Delhi over the last three days since his return from Lucknow.Raje tweeted on Friday to say, “While in Lucknow, I attended a dinner with my son Dushyant and his in-laws. Kanika, who has unfortunately tested positive for Covid-19, was also a guest. As a matter of abundant caution, my son and I have immediately self-quarantined and we’re taking all necessary precautions.”Kapoor was among four persons who tested positive for Covid-19 in Lucknow on Friday, triggering concern among the political class.Some MPs who spent any time in proximity with Dushyant have also gone in for self-quarantine, while others are anxiously checking on whether they were near him. The results of his seclusion may well be keenly awaited. Trinamool Congress MP Derek O’Brien went into self-quarantine, as he had spent a good two and half hours next to Dushyant at a parliamentary standing committee meeting.Rajya Sabha MP and renowned dancer Sonal Mansingh was also at the meeting. O’Brien tweeted that the government was putting everyone at risk and the session should be curtailed. Congress leader and former MP Jitin Prasada also attended the same gathering as Kapoor and Dushyant and quarantined himself in Shahjahanpur as did Deepender Hooda, who had lunch with Dushyant on Thursday.UP health minister Jai Pratap Singh, who was present at the Lucknow party, also went into self-quarantine. “We had gone to a birthday party in which Kanika Kapoor was also invited. Though we are fine by the grace of God, we all have self-quarantined ourselves,” he said in a tweet.Among others who went into “self-isolation” were Noida BJP MLA Pankaj Singh , who attended a meeting with Jai Pratap, and Lok Sabha MP Anupriya Patel of Apna Dal, who tweeted: “I was present at an event yesterday and Dushyant Singh was also present. As a precaution, I am going for self-isolation.”In Lucknow, health officials told TOI that that during her stay in Lucknow, Kanika spent a few nights at a five-star hotel, attended several social gatherings besides paying a visit to a doctor and a beauty salon which brought every one of those she came in contact with under the coronavirus radar.Additional chief secretary (home) Awanish Awasthi asked the DMs of Lucknow and Kanpur to submit a report on various functions attended by the singer and urged all those who came in contact with her to “self-quarantine”.Kanika came to Mumbai from London on March 9. She then took an Air India flight to Lucknow on March 11. She claimed that she was scanned and cleared at Mumbai airport on arrival from London and the symptoms started appearing around March 16 when she was in Lucknow.She gave her sample at KGMU Hospital two days later and on Friday she tested positive.The district administration closed down the five-star hotel in Lucknow’s Gomtinagar where she stayed till further orders.Chief medical officer (Lucknow) Narendra Agarwal said: “Contact tracing and awareness exercise has been launched. So far, 68 immediate family members and relatives have been tested. The report will take a day.” He said Kanika was admitted to the isolation ward at Sanjay Gandhi Post-Graduate Institute.The Lucknow health office also formed eight teams to track Kanika’s possible contacts. The DM has also formed search teams to reach out to the guests who came in contact with Kanika.Earlier, Kanika also announced from her social media account that she had tested positive: “For the past four days, I have had signs of flu. I got myself tested and it came positive for Covid-19. I am feeling ok, like normal flu and mild fever, however we need to be sensible citizens.”",india,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74740217,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-231398,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/bollywood-singer-kanika-kapoor-tests-positive-for-covid-19-brings-political-class-under-corona-scare/articleshow/74740216.cms

This is how the Bollywood actors are keeping themselves busy,"With most B-Town actors self-quarantining themselves in the wake of the coronavirus outbreak, they are finally doing things that they have been wanting to, but didn’t have the time for. While some are using this forced break to spend quality time with families and focus on fitness, others are pursuing old hobbies or even picking up new ones. We spoke to a few actors about what’s keeping them occupied. Read on…

Saif Ali Khan

To begin with, I am not answering any phone messages (laughs!). Other than that, I spend time gymming at home, reading, cooking and binge watching.

Lara Dutta

Mahesh (Bhupati, husband), Saira (daughter) and I are working on interesting projects. We have made the solar system using paper. I am overseeing a storybook, which Saira is busy writing by herself. I have been using this time off to practise meditation and yoga as well. I am a terrible cook, and never enter the kitchen (laughs!). So, I am reading recipes and trying my hand at different dishes. Most importantly, I have been checking on family members from across the world. This virus has brought all of us down to our knees. It has given us a chance to slow down and introspect.

Taapsee Pannu

I am working out at home and catching up on sleep. I am also reading pending scripts and binge watching the movies I have missed from 2019. There’s so much to do! So, I’m pretty much ready for quarantine time.

Richa Chadha

I will finally get time to read and finish a lot of pending writing work. I am also pursuing a dance course online, and gardening. I plan to catch up on the recent film releases that I missed as well.

Siddhant Chaturvedi

I am binge-watching movies, especially the Academy Award-winning ones, and the series that I have missed. I am also prepping for my film with director Shakun Batra. That apart, I read and paint, and also work out regularly at home.

Aparshakti Khurana

I am utilising this time to slow down and reflect, spend time with my family and do things that will help me recharge. And yes, I am washing my hands all day! I have also been penning down a few short poems.

Elli AvrRam

I love being at home by myself when I’m not working, so there’s not much of a difference for me, except that I feel I’m on a long rejuvenating holiday. I spend a lot of time reading, writing, meditating and reflecting. I’ve already bought a lot of plants to set up a ‘runaway’ garden on two of my balconies. I am also cooking again, the way I used to in Sweden. Plus, I’m looking for a piano, because it’s been on my wish list to learn how to play the instrument.

Athiya Shetty

I am spending time with my family and trying to finish the books on my reading list. I have also just finished baking gluten-free banana bread! For me, it’s all about finding joy in simple things and being grateful. Also, I’ve got the best trainer in the world… my dad (Suniel Shetty)! He won’t spare me, and we’re doing home workouts.

Akshay Oberoi

I am spending time with my son. It’s nice to have his undivided attention. A few days ago, I helped him plant his first tulsi plant in our balcony. These tough times are a reminder for us to slow down and live in the moment — something our generation often forgets.

Sunny Singh

I am enjoying my time at home, working out regularly, reading scripts and watching a lot of movies. I also love sitting in my balcony and sip on coffee while listening to songs.

Adah Sharma

These days, I spend a lot of time playing the piano. I am also getting trained in Silambam (martial art). There’s nothing more rejuvenating than learning something new.

Geeta Basra

This is a welcome break. Otherwise, Harbhajan (Singh, husband) is constantly travelling because of his work. This is actually the first time we are spending so much time together at our home in Mumbai. We enjoy doing yoga at home. Sometimes, even our daughter joins us.

Aahana Kumra

I am catching up on a lot of movies and shows. I am also using this time to clean my house and cook. I also ensure that I work out every single day.",entertainment,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74740273,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-40394/74740273.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/hindi/bollywood/news/quarantined-at-home-this-is-how-the-bollywood-actors-are-keeping-themselves-busy/articleshow/74740273.cms

California extended its “shelter in place” orders to all 40 million residents of the state, saying people should leave their homes only for essential business. Gov. Andrew Cuomo of New York has expressed his dislike of the term, but with more than 5,200 confirmed cases — the highest in the nation — the state has asked for much the same thing.The State Department warned Americans not to leave the country, and said that citizens who are already abroad should either return home or stay where they are.A Senate debate over a $1 trillion relief package was hamstrung by the kind of partisan division that had largely paralyzed Congress before the pandemic.Economists warned that the suspension of ordinary commerce was already savaging businesses and producing record levels of job losses.The Labor Department reported a 30 percent increase in unemployment claims last week, one of the largest spikes on record. The department also asked state officials not to release precise figures, according to an email reviewed by The New York Times.And as countries around the world try to confront a crisis within their own borders, there has been a creeping sense that nationalistic interests are also at work.Vaccine trials are underway in the United States , Europe and China. While there is cooperation, governments will try to ensure that their own people are the first in line. And an effective vaccine is likely to be 12 to 18 months away, public health experts say.The immediate challenge remained trying to slow the spread of the virus, and limit the corresponding surge of patients that could overwhelm health systems, as happened in China and Italy The death toll in Italy, which has 64 million people, surpassed China’s, with a population of 1.4 billion, raising profound questions about the effectiveness of restricting movement in Western democracies unable to enforce those measures with the efficiency of an authoritarian regime.With other European countries seeing exponential increases in confirmed cases, officials said it was only a matter of days before hospitals throughout the continent would begin to be overwhelmed. Germany has 14,000 confirmed infections and 31 deaths. Starting at midnight, residents across the southern state of Bavaria will no longer be allowed to leave their homes without a justifiable reason such as grocery shopping or caring for a relative — but only alone or with family members.",world,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74740286,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-685048,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/europe/coronavirus-outbreak-627-die-in-italy-in-24-hrs-global-toll-crosses-10000/articleshow/74740289.cms
30,['21/03/2020'],"Coronavirus cases in India: With 57 new cases, steepest rise in 1 day","NEW DELHI: India saw a big spike in Covid-19 infections with 57 new cases being reported by state authorities and 50 by the health ministry on Friday — by far the highest in a single day — as several parts of the country began to feel the impact of the outbreak.Curfew was clamped in Rajasthan’s Bhilwara town, several localities in Madhya Pradesh and Kerala put under lockdown and prohibitary orders extended to more areas.So far, 255 cases have been reported in the country, around 44% of which (111) have come in the last three days. The health ministry confirmed 223 cases. Madhya Pradesh became the 21st state/UT to report the coronavirus infection, with four cases surfacing in Jabalpur, prompting authorities to order a lockdown in two localities.The government acknowledged the surge, with joint secretary (health) Lav Aggarwal on Friday saying cases had increased “progressively“ and social distancing was, therefore, important to stop this chain of transmission. So far, the Centre had maintained that the outbreak was limited to persons with travel history and their contacts.“All states have been asked to use all legal powers, be it the Epidemic Diseases Act, Disaster Management Act, CrPc or IPC to implement this (social distancing),” Aggarwal said.Kerala and Delhi reported 12 and 6 cases, respectively, on Friday, the highest in a single day. Restrictions were imposed in Kasargod town of Kerala, where six new cases were reported.In Rajasthan’s Bhilwara town, reported eight cases of Covid-19 of which six were among doctors and nurses. Local authorities said they have not been able to identify the source or any possible contact with an infected person yet.“Curfew has been imposed in Bhilwara. The situation is alarming as 500 people who were in contact with the three infected doctors and three nursing staff have been kept in isolation.”Section 144 has also been imposed in Ahmedabad, Vadodara, Surat and Rajkot in Gujarat in view of the increasing number of Covid-19 cases. The state reported seven new cases on Friday.With the number of cases rising, the health ministry has issued a fresh advisory stating that no suspected Covid-19 patient should be turned away from any hospital. “Similarly, all pneumonia patients must also be notified to the National Centre for Disease Control so they could be tested for Covid-19,” the advisory said.This is a significant change in testing policy for Covid-19 and signals that community transmission has started or is about to start because so far the government insisted testing was only required for persons with travel history or their contacts if they showed symptoms of the viral infection.Also, the government extended the universal screening of passengers to passengers coming from Australia, the UK and the US for risk-profiling them for either quarantine or isolation citing increased number of cases and deaths in these countries. The number of Covid-19 deaths in India remains four, as the government said the death of a 69-year-old Italian tourist, Andri Carly, in Jaipur could not be considered a Covid-19 death because he had recovered from the infection.“He was a chain-smoker and had other co-morbidities for which he was undergoing treatment. Unfortunately, he suffered cardiac arrest and died,” Aggarwal said.Meanwhile, Prime Minister Narendra Modi deliberated on ways to check the spread of coronavirus with chief ministers of various states on Friday. Health minister Harsh Vardhan and top health ministry officials were present in the meeting held via video link. Besides discussing ways to check the spread of the virus, issues such as capacity building of states and extending training to local health officials also came for discussion.",india,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74740266,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-203757,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/coronavirus-outbreak-with-57-new-cases-steepest-rise-in-1-day/articleshow/74740263.cms

They took paracetamol an hour before landing, to lower their body temperature and not get ‘caught’ in the thermal screening being done at the Indian airports,” said Ennamsetty in a social media post.Ennamsetty warned health authorities that foreign returnees who masked their actual body temperature and symptoms were staying with their parents and was putting everyone else at great health risk.His story underscores how scores of people across India are taking medicines to lower their body temperature and escaping thermal checks to risk their family, neighbours and friends. Some experts have said if undetected, it would lead to a huge spike in Coronavirus numbers.Telangana has reported 18 cases of Covid-19 so far, with eight positive cases alone on Wednesday.“Early this morning I have been (sic) tested positive for Covid-19. I am admitted to the isolation ward at Gandhi Hospital. My chain of contact confirms that no one else needs to be isolated in relation to my case as I have taken all precautions to not meet anyone post my arrival in India from the UK,” said Ennamsetty through a post on facebook.A student of LLM in human rights law at the University of Edinburgh, Ennamsetty highlighted how students had “lied in the self-declaration forms given on the flight about the symptoms in order to escape getting quarantined upon arrival. These are the people who are now staying with their families and friends around you, maybe on the very next door (sic).”Speaking to TOI, Ennamsetty, said he knew about 10 people who took paracetamol on the flight.While appreciating the steps being taken at airports, especially in Hyderabad, he said it was not fool-proof, since they were relying only on thermal screening and he himself was largely asymptomatic.“I did not have a fever, just a mild sore throat which also is not there today. To be on the safe side, I got myself tested and found I was Covid-19 positive,” he said.Ennamsetty says that many in the UK may have been exposed to the virus because of the earlier ‘herd immunity’ approach that they were following. “UK’s approach towards controlling this pandemic has been worrying. They wanted most of the population to get infected so as to gain immunity. Though this has a scientific base, it doesn’t seem very promising at this hour of a public emergency.”The UK has since announced that it would drop the policy, but many are wary about the high exposure people have already had.Ennamsetty has this year received backing from Clinton Global Initiative University (CGI U 2020) to fund his dream of the first-ever ‘Centre for Rights Activism’ in Telangana through which he hopes to fight for victims of human right abuses.“This is a global public health emergency and we all have to be together in this fight. Please follow all the precautions given out by public authorities. It’s no longer an easy game,” Ennamsetty added.",india,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74740309,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-306120,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/covid-19-many-took-meds-to-dodge-isolation/articleshow/74740317.cms

This was the culmination of a long judicial process during which the parents of the victim, Nirbhaya , swung between hope and despair. “She got justice today. Through the day I have been looking at her photo and telling her she finally got justice,” said a visibly moved Asha Devi, mother of Nirbhaya.

The fifth culprit, Ram Singh, had been found hanging in his jail cell in March 2013, four months after the incident, while the sixth convict, found to be a juvenile, was let off as part of a reformation process.

The incident had shaken the conscience of the nation, leading to widespread outrage and demonstrations. It led to significant changes in the law — death penalty for rapists who brutalise their victims, full trial as adults for juveniles accused of heinous offences and fast-track courts for speedy trial in sexual assault cases. A Nirbhaya fund was set up by the Centre in 2013 to fund women’s safety initiatives but utilisation has been quite poor.

The execution of the four convicts – Vinay, Pawan, Akshay and Mukesh – was the first mass hanging in Tihar Jail . The jail administration availed the services of a hangman though he hadn’t hanged anyone before that but came from a family of hangmen. The last hanging was of Parliament attack convict Afzal Guru who had been hanged by a jail official amidst high drama.

The executioner, Pawan Jallad , had to hold several dummy hangings in the specially constructed well in Tihar as the convicts availed every provision in the law and managed to get their hanging stayed on multiple occasions. The convicts exercised their options till two hours before the hangings as their lawyer approached the high court and Supreme Court through the night.

The four men lodged in prison number 3 were woken up around 3.30am and informed about their order for execution. The jail doctor checked their vital signs and declared them fit for hanging. The Tihar authorities asked the four men to put on white cotton clothes and offered them breakfast. Despite resistance from the men, the jail officials tied their hands and covered their faces with a black mask before guiding them to the gallows. The district magistrate, jail superintendent, his deputies and about 24 jail guards accompanied them to the hanging well. They were hanged at 5.30am.

Jail sources said the earnings of the convicts were handed over to their family members to complete their last rites. According to jail records, Akshay had earned Rs 69,000 during his stay while Vinay and Pawan earned Rs 39,000 and Rs 29,000, respectively. Mukesh had refused to work ever since he was lodged in the jail.

Mukesh donated his organs while Vinay had asked for his “paintings” to be handed over to the authorities. However, no painting could be found. A jail official who met him a couple of days back recalled he was making a sketch inside his cell. “When I had gone there, he was making a sketch of Hanuman and a Shivling,” he said. This has been handed over to the jail superintendent.

Despite the outrage provoked by Nirbhaya’s rape and murder and tightening of laws that followed, women’s safety remains an issue with crimes against women rising steadily from 3.4 lakh in 2016 to 3.5 lakh in 2017 and 3.6 lakh in 2018, the last year for which official data is available.

The number of rapes too has increased significantly from just under 25,000 in 2012, the year of Nirbhaya’s killing, to nearly 34,000 in 2018. That’s about 93 women or girls being raped every day in India or close to one every 15 minutes.

The justice system too continues to let them down with the number of cases being closed annually barely half of the number of rapes and the conviction rate for completed cases a mere 27.2% in 2018, which means three out of four rape accused ultimately walk free.

34,['21/03/2020'],MP govt falls as Nath quits before floor test,"BHOPAL: After two weeks of electrifying political drama, triggered by the shock defection of Jyotiraditya Scindia which eventually led to the collapse of the Congress government, Kamal Nath handed in his resignation as chief minister on Friday, saying betrayal by “Maharaj” and “political greed” has defeated the hopes and belief of Madhya Pradesh .

Hitting out for the first time at Scindia, Nath said: “One Maharaja and his 22 accomplices, together with BJP, murdered democratic values. People will never forgive these greedy persons who betrayed the state.”

Referring to the twists and turns of the past fortnight, which saw 22 Congress MLAs revolt against the party, Nath’s parting message was: “We need to remember that after today, tomorrow comes. People will give a befitting reply.”

Around 1.15pm, with the clock ticking on Supreme Court-ordered floor test, the CM’s convoy rolled into Raj Bhavan , where Nath handed his resignation. “In 40 years of public life, I have always practised politics of cleanliness and given priority to democratic values. Whatever happened in the past two weeks in Madhya Pradesh is a new chapter in the devaluation of democratic tenets,” he said in his resignation letter, adding that he would support the next CM in development of the state.

As soon as Nath, 73, resigned, celebration broke out in the BJP camp. Leaders and workers distributed sweets and burst firecrackers. “If a government topples due to their own internal conflict, then we can't do anything. You can see we were not in the game to form or topple a government,” said former CM Shivraj Singh Chouhan , believed to be in the lead for a fourth term as CM.

Scindia tweeted: “I have always believed that politics should be the medium of public service, but the state government had deviated from this path. Truth has won again. Satyamev Jayate .”

Nath indicated that the fight is far from over. When Congress MLAs went to meet him at CM House earlier in the day and requested him not to quit as PCC chief, he told them: “I will be with you. We will be back in six months.”

After handing his resignation to the governor, Nath tweeted: “Today, the hopes and beliefs of Madhya Pradesh have been defeated. The gluttonous and avaricious have won. No one can win by crushing the self-respect of Madhya Pradesh. I will continue to work for the state with all my determination.”

The Congress government that came to power after defeating the 15-year-old BJP government lasted 15 months. “BJP got 15 years. I got 15 months, two and a half months of which went in the model code of conduct,” Nath pointed out at a press meet before he headed for Raj Bhavan. He said that in this short period, his government fulfilled 400 promises made in the Vachan Patra.

“I have decided to give my resignation to the governor. And there is just one reason — the principles and values that I follow don’t permit the politics of horse-trading,” he said, adding: “People gave me five years to take the state on the right path, to give Madhya Pradesh a new identity. My efforts were to ensure that the state is no longer compared to smaller states of the country but the bigger ones.”

Nath said that in the past 15 months, every citizen has seen his government’s public welfare policies and work. “In fear and panic, BJP kept conspiring against our government. A month after our government was formed, BJP began saying every 15 days that this is a ‘short-term government’. They started plotting from the first day but we still worked,” Nath said.

He reeled off a list of welfare schemes — farm loan waiver, subsidized electricity to 1 crore families, hike in old-age pension — and his government’s war against mafia and adulteration. Nath added that he is confident he “will get people’s certificate”.

NEW DELHI: Amid claims by some experts that India was “under-testing” for Covid-19, health minister Harsh Vardhan on Friday said infections had not reached “community level” and defended the testing criteria as being a well-defined protocol based on scientific advice on who needs to be screened for the disease.Responding to concerns expressed by MPs in Lok Sabha , Vardhan said, “I can say with perfect and utmost confidence and authenticity that whatever tests we are doing — and on whom — are with perfect scientific advice. No one in this House should have any doubts about that.”Vardhan was responding to the issue that has been raised outside the House as well. The government has said that randomised testing of patients with severe respiratory problems was sufficient to check for community spread and arguments based on “tests per million” were misplaced. The protocol was also being revised to expand tests even as it was necessary to avoid wasteful testing that may take attention away from those who actually need it.On a question raised by Congress member Manish Tewari about the origin of coronavirus in the backdrop of many contradictory reports, the minister said, “It is being investigated. Every time a new virus comes, it gets mutated and a new virus comes.” Tiwari asked whether Covid-19 was a naturally occurring virus or the “result of a certain scientific experiment or a series of scientific experiments which may have gone astray”.Vardhan said, “As per our information, I do not think there is any need for any apprehension. A lot of things are making the rounds on WhatsApp and all. At the moment, as per our conversations with the WHO, there is neither any authenticity nor any substance in those reports.”He told the House that China reported the first case on December 30, 2019, when it said it had noticed some cases of pneumonia which had an unknown etiology and they were not able to pinpoint the actual cause.“On January 7, 2020, they reported to the World Health Organisation that they have been able to establish that this is probably a new or novel coronavirus. They have been informing and accordingly, I would like to inform the House, we have been the first country in the world... on January 8 we had a technical expert group meeting in our ministry,” Vardhan said.",india,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74740342,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-255378,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/health-minister-harsh-vardhan-denies-under-testing-says-checks-protocol-based/articleshow/74740341.cms

NEW DELHI: Those flouting the law and ditching home quarantine can face up to six months in jail along with a fine, the health ministry said while asking people to strictly follow the advisories, protocols and guidelines.“We have empowered states to use stringent provisions of the law to ensure people do not break quarantine and spread the disease. Observing quarantine and maintaining social distancing are crucial to managing this kind of infectious disease,” a health ministry official said.Under Section 10 of the Epidemic Disease Act and Section 10 of the Disaster Management Act, states have been empowered to take penal action with provisions of up to six months of imprisonment or Rs 1,000 fine or both, depending on the violation.While the enabling provisions of these laws have already been invoked by the Centre , the health ministry has again written to states to enforce these provisions.This came in the wake of recent cases where people ran away from isolation or did not observe home quarantine.The health ministry reported 223 confirmed cases of Covid-19 on Friday. Besides, over 6,700 people who came in contact with positive cases were put under rigorous observation and another 1.12 lakh people were under community surveillance. So far, over 15,000 samples have been tested in India.“Cases have increased progressively and social distancing is, therefore, important to stop this chain of transmission,” joint secretary in health ministry Lav Agarwal said.He urged people to use the toll free number 1075 for any query and said there was no shortage of essential commodities.Central teams have been sent to states to hand-hold them in strengthening their capacities, he added.",india,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74740344,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-643806,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/coronavirus-outbreak-breaking-home-quarantine-may-lead-to-jail-warn-officials/articleshow/74740346.cms

In a letter to the PM on Friday, Odisha chief minister Naveen Patnaik said all efforts of the state machinery were directed towards containment of Covid-19 and mobilisation for Census and concerned activities posed a risk for field functionaries and the people. “I would rather suggest to postpone the scheduled Census and related activities,” he said.While home ministry officials were tight-lipped on whether Census/NPR schedules were under review, sources indicated a decision may be announced in the next few days. A functionary said even if the starting date was deferred a little to focus on Covid-19, Census houselisting/NPR exercise could well be completed within the September 2020 deadline.The assessment within the Modi government is that mandatory door-to-door visits for houselisting and NPR put both the enumerator as well as respondents at risk as India deals with rising cases of Covid-19. Also, with the Centre, state governments and local administrations preoccupied with tackling the outbreak and many states having shut down public places, offices and shops, it may be impractical to expect them to spare human resources for the massive field exercise.Census authorities have notified a window from April 1 to September 30 to complete houselisting and NPR in each state and Union territory. States must notify a 45-day slot within this six-month period to hold the two exercises. “This is meant to offer them flexibility in drawing up a schedule that beats local conditions like extreme heat or monsoon. Given that states/UTs notify their respective schedules, there is always an option of delaying the April 1 start to Census/NPR by a few days or weeks,” a government functionary said.Many states have expressed apprehensions about NPR update, particularly new questions such as date and place of birth of parents. While Kerala has said no to NPR exercise, West Bengal and Telangana have put it on hold.

Navaratra begins on March 25.Amid concerns over the possibility of a large gathering on the occasion like previous years, a government spokesperson said the Ram Navami snaan was not organised by the state administration like the Kumbh Mela and the district authorities only take care of the crowd management.Additional chief secretary (home) Awanish Awasthi said the chief minister had already directed all the DMs to reach out to religious heads and ask them to postpone all religious congregations till April 23.Sources in the government said the border of Ayodhya district might me sealed on Ram Navami to restrict the crowd from outside. This apart, the administration may implement social distancing and allow a maximum of five people to move together in a group.“As it is people are not venturing out. The prime minister and the chief minister have appealed to the people not to venture out of their homes unless it is unavoidable. Under such a situation it should not be a problem if we restrict the snan for locals only,” said a senior official privy to the arrangements for crowd control under way in Ayodhya. Mahant Dinendra Das of Nirhmohi Akhara said every year a meeting of seers is held to finalise the schedule and events of the snaan and Ram Navmi Mela but this year the meeting has not taken place as it will lead to a gathering which may not be the right thing to do under the virus scare.“There is hardly any preparation in place for the mela and snan. Only a few barricades have come up so far. It is unlikely that any crowd would gather,” said Mahant Girish Pati Tripathi , head priest of Tewari Mandir near Tulsi Udyan in Ayodhya.Some seers, however, suggested that apart from a general appeal to stop religious gatherings, a specific appeal about Ram Navami Mela should be made.

Cops said they were mulling the wide-scale use of the West Bengal Prevention of Spitting in Public Place Act to stop people spitting in public and stop the spread of the virus. The police are now studying the legal ramifications.“The idea is to use this act as a deterrent. All other such public utility laws are under consideration so that we can launch a special drive at the earliest,” said an officer.The police claimed they were looking to use this law to also build public awareness. “The aim, by fining a few offenders, is to explain how this could add to the spread of the virus. It is also an effort to show the citizens that basic hygiene is non-negotiable,” said an officer.Chief minister Mamata Banerjee has taken a keen interest in keeping the city clean and had, in 2018, formed a committee to modify the existing laws and look into options of imposing stricter penalties on offenders. The committee was headed by the chief secretary and had the senior-most IAS and IPS officers of the state on it. The plan was to make citizens shell out a maximum of Rs 1 lakh after the Bengal Assembly passed a Bill in the Legislative Assembly to enhance the fine.The Act, introduced in 2003, imposed a fine of Rs 200 on the defaulters.

KOLKATA: The traffic police have identified 40 stretches — including some of the most chaotic roads in south and south-suburban Kolkata — which will henceforth be no-parking zones. This is the first time that so many roads from the added areas have been declared no-parking zones, said sources at Lalbazar. Among the areas which have been specifically chosen are Kasba, Haltu, Topsia, Tollygunge , New Alipore, Behala , Naktala and Thakurpukur.

“This is the result of a long study. We found that vehicles — from buses to rickshaws — were blocking normal flow of traffic. We have allowed a few auto, taxi and bus stands to operate as usual. However, for motorists, it is important they choose to park only in the bylanes. This might inconvenience a few, but it is important to increase mobility and speed,” said an officer.

Joint CP (traffic) Santosh Pandey said the move is also aimed at ensuring fee-parking spaces are identified after the KMC said it wanted to introduce parking fees at specific lots in this area. “This is not a sudden decision. We have weighed the pros and cons before taking this step,” he said.

Among major roads earmarked as no-parking stretches are Park Circus Connector, Prince Anwar Shah Road, Deshapran Sashmal Road between Tolly Club and Jubilee Park Road, and NSC Bose Road between Uttam Kumar statue and Ranikuthi, Haltu Main Road, DPS School Road and Baisnabghata Patuli Road, as well as almost all Behala roads.

“We have also identified other issues regarding parking, like parking on pavements. There is also parking in front of shops since basement garages are put to commercial use,” said an officer.

In an address to nation from Kathmandu, Oli said all long-distance public buses within Nepal would stop operating from March 23 for an indefinite period. He also exhorted Nepalis not to hold large gatherings and to restrict all non-essential movement.

Nepal’s Civil Aviation Authority has further banned all passengers, including Nepalis from entering from EU countries, UK, West Asia, Gulf nations, Iran, Malaysia, Turkey, South Korea and Japan. The entry ban takes effect from Friday midnight itself.

On Wednesday Nepal had already announced the stoppage of all passengers arriving by air from Europe and West Asia, including transit passengers. But that ban did not include airlines flying to Chinese and Indian cities, Bangkok and Singapore from Kathmandu. Now, even those flights will stop operating from Sunday.

Taking the tourism industry’s concerns forward, deputy PM Ishwor Pokhrel, chairing the coordination committee on Covid-19 on Wednesday imposed a crowd ban limiting it to 25 people. Foreign nationals unable to return home due to travel restrictions may avail visa extensions. Hotels, restaurants and malls are to provide sanitisers and also regularly sanitize tables, chairs, bars, railings and washrooms. Thermometers have been made mandatory to screen people entering such public spaces.

Recuperating from the devastating earthquake of 2015, Nepal’s economy vitally hinged on visitors. “The need of the hour is to concentrate on mitigation and preparedness,” said Raj Gyawali, member of the national level crisis communication unit at a meeting of the Nepal Tourism Think Tank | Into the Future late on Tuesday. Nineteen of the 25 participants were connected online from different tourist hotspots in the country.

On Friday, Gyawali, in an update, announced the closure of trekking in Nepal. This followed closure of climbing expeditions. “The machinery finally works to stop the spread in the mountains,” he wrote, signing off with relief for now -- ‘Live cases in Nepal: Still Zero’.

“Do not be selfish about your business. Everyone is suffering. We need to raise awareness and follow WHO guidelines,” Gyawali appealed.

The Think Tank consensus has been to focus on response and recovery. Kelly Maya Magar, who runs a rafting company and a boutique hotel in Pokhara, shared her mixed experience. “My rafting company is receiving 50 emails a day with advance cancellations and refund requests. It is different at my hotel which is surprisingly still busy. Our focus is to keep our employees and guests safe,” she said.

Kim, running a trekking company and also organizing cycling trips, is faced with cancellation of all trips. She, too, pitched for safety. “Our advice should be: Do not come,” she told her Think Tank fellow tourism professionals. “How the rest of the world will see Nepal is the big picture,” Kim said.

Convener Gyawali said, “Everyone is concerned. Send all travellers home and if anyone is sick, treat the guest. If any guests are still left, treat them well, keep them safe, make them have an excellent experience. Our guests now will be our future marketers.”

“I had to send home nearly half my staff over the past two days as clients in Spain,Israel, and the UK have cancelled or suspended their orders. There is no point in keeping them and not paying their salaries,” Annadurai said. “It is a stretch”.

With five out of six garments exported to these two markets, the crisis is sweeping across the city, forcing factories or pink slipped workers..

“Each month Tirpur exports nearly 2,500 crore worth garments. We have not received any money from buyers for January and February. That makes it 5,000 crore in dues, all of which have been shipped and are locked in various ports due to coronavirus. Add another 2,500 crore in dues for March,” said Raja M Shanmugam, president of Tirupur Exporters Association and founder of Warsaw International.

Every European brand, Primark, S Oliver, Tom Taylor and others have either cancelled their orders or suspended it.

Irish retailer Primark, one of the largest buyers from Tirupur, in a communication said that it was seeing an unprecedented closure of stores globally. “Therefore, unfortunately we have been left with no option but to place a hold on any new orders. Additionally, we are reviewing the position in relation to all orders yet to be booked in prior to hand over. It is likely that in most circumstances we will have little option but to terminate those…..we would also recommend that you seriously consider putting on halt on all current and future production,” the retailer said in a communication to an exporter in Tirupur.

The situation has become untenable, exporters said. “We need an urgent stimulus package from the government. And not just that, we should be compensated for our losses. When monsoon fails, the farmer is compensated, why shouldn't exporters be compensated for no fault of theirs,” Annadurai said. The closely knit business units in the knitwear town works on the principles of revolving credit.

And changing markets is both tough and difficult. While the issue with exports is dented by Corona pandemic, diverting production to the domestic market isn't easy. For one, the export products are expensive and in a price sensitive market like India, it will not find many buyers and two the domestic market is by itself in the throes of an economic slump.

“Suddenly, everything has fallen apart,” summed up Shanmugam of TEA.

Even the prices of Dettol solutions have gone up in the local market.Several people bought hand sanitizers in bulk, leading to shortage of the product in the market. Owners of medical shops and supermarkets said they were running out of the stock of hand sanitizers and face masks. Some supermarkets have started providing only two hand sanitizers and two packets of hand wash per person in a bid to deal with the shortage.Rohit Singhania, sales executive of a supermarket at Sri Krishnapuri, said the salesgirls and cashiers are ensuring that people buy not more than two sanitizers. “We sanitize the hands of customers before allowing them to enter the shop. Sanitary staff disinfect the shop wearing gloves and masks,” he added.Medical shops are also witnessing sudden surge in demand for hand sanitizer, Dettol solution and face masks. “Face mask is already out of stock. We are giving only one sanitizer, hand wash and Dettol solution per person,” said Ankit Keshri, owner of a retail drugstore on Govind Mitra Road.Several shops are facing problem in restocking hand sanitizers. Animesh, owner of a medical store on S P Verma Road, said most local shops and medical stores are already out of stock of sanitizers.Shops and online platforms have increased the prices of hand sanitizers and face masks. Suranjana, a resident of Rajendra Nagar, said most online platforms are charging thrice the actual price of hand sanitizers and face masks. “Branded sanitizers are out of stock,” he added.Meanwhile, vendors at local markets are making brisk business by selling net-based face masks, though they are not considered effective in containing spread of Covid-19.Gajendra, a local shopkeeper, said more than 60 people visit his shop daily to buy face masks. “We have increased the prices of mask from Rs 20 to Rs 50 per piece,” he added.",patna,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74742839,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-486299,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/hand-sanitizers-fly-off-the-shelves/articleshow/74737332.cms
46,['21/03/2020'],Sebi makes short selling tougher to curb volatility,"MUMBAI: To mitigate rising risks due to coronavirus-induced volatility in the stock market, Sebi on Friday made it tougher for traders to speculate by short-selling, raised margin requirement in the cash segment, made it expensive for traders to play the market and also tightened margin systems in the derivatives segment.Under the new rules, most of which will be effective from March 23 to April 22, Sebi also reduced limits on the number of shares of a company that could be traded in the derivatives segment, called position limits. At the same time, Sebi increased penalties for flouting these limits.It also put greater responsibility on the stock exchanges and clearing corporations to maintain market integrity by participants. Market players said the new measures will help reduce volatility. They added that the steps were prudent and especially, unlike in many other countries, the Indian market regulator has refrained from banning short-selling completely.These measures have been taken after discussions with the stock exchanges, clearing corporations and depositories, Sebi said in a release. “Pursuant to the said discussions and keeping in view the objective of ensuring orderly trading and settlement, effective risk management, price discovery and maintenance of market integrity, (these) measures have been taken,” the release said. “Sebi and stock exchanges will continuously monitor the market developments and review the position and take any further suitable actions as may be required,” Sebi said.Sebi changed rules so that stocks that show extreme volatility could be temporarily banned from trading. Sebi said that the bourses and clearing corporations have been asked to check on an intra-day basis if any member or client exceeded their existing positions or created a new position in the scrips in the new ban period. “The current penalty structure adopted by the stock exchanges and clearing corporations may be enhanced to 10 times of the minimum and five times of the maximum penalties specified by (these entities) to function as an effective deterrent in the current market context,” the release said.According to Jimeet Modi, founder & CEO, Samco Securities , these are aimed at reducing excessive volatility in the market. “Market-wise limits have been reduced, which means more stocks are likely to go into ban period in the derivatives segment. Also, there is a practical short-selling cap at Rs 500 crore that’s been levied. If someone wants to speculate beyond prescribed limits of Rs 500 crore, they will need to put up twice the margin, which will be blocked for three months,” he said. “The impact of this circular would be highest on stocks with very high volatility. Effectively, 10-12% of the stocks in the derivatives segment would be impacted,” Modi said.According to Ajay Kejriwal, president, Choice Broking , unlike in many other markets where short-selling was banned to curb speculation as a fallout of the market slide on Covid-19, “Sebi has prudently restricted market-wide position through this initiative. With increase in margins for cash segments in selective stocks, it will also reduce the volumes in the market and ensure less leverage and volatility in India where VIX, the volatility index had surged to the highest level since the 2008,” he said.",business,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74743702,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-58187,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/sebi-makes-short-selling-tougher-to-curb-volatility/articleshow/74739982.cms

PATNA: A five-year-old boy, Ankit Raj alias Ankush, who had gone missing on March 18, was found murdered on the outskirts of Ahiari village under the Rajapakar police station area in Vaishali district on Friday.

The deceased’s mother, Ranju Devi, had lodged a missing complaint with the Rajapakar police station on Wednesday apprehending Ankush’s kidnapping from the village. However, the police failed to trace the boy.

On Friday, some locals spotted the body floating on the water. They immediately informed the victim’s family, who subsequently reported the matter to the police.

The police had to face the ire of the locals for their failure to recover the boy safely. The locals held the police personnel captive for a couple of hours. They were released only after Mahua sub-divisional police officer (SDPO) Nurul Haq rushed to the village and assured arrest of the culprits at the earliest. The victim’s father, who worked at a factory in Pune, was not present at the village at the time of incident.

Mahua SDPO Haq said, “The body has been sent to the sadar hospital at Hajipur for post mortem. Further action will be taken on the basis of the autopsy report, which is awaited.”

SHO of Rajapakar police station Md Kalimuddin said the police carried out raids at suspected hideouts of the criminals on Thursday but nobody was arrested.

While the numbers of casual staff working at India’s biggest conglomerate as well as largest private sector employer couldn’t be ascertained, some of its companies like Tata Projects employ huge numbers of temps for construction activities.Other companies too are doing their bit, responding to the fallout from coronavirus. Bajaj Group scion Rajiv Bajaj said that he will cut his salary to zero before a single employee is laid off. The managing director of Bajaj Auto , one of Motown India’s highly paid executives, took home a salary of Rs 32 crore in fiscal 2019.Paytm founder Vijay Shekhar Sharma will forego two months salary to “help office staff who may need it” after being inspired by Marriott CEO (the lodging company’s chief said that he will not take any salary for the rest of the year). On Thursday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had appealed to employers to not cut salaries of people during these testing times.Tata Group chairman N Chandrasekaran said that the current situation is likely to have a large and deep financial impact on the weaker socio-economic segments of the society. “During this time of crisis, our group companies commit to ensuring full payments to temporary workers and daily wage earners in India for the months of March and April, even if these workers are not able to work due to either quarantine measures, site closures, plant shutdowns or other reasons.”Corporate earnings in the fourth quarter of this fiscal are expected to be weak due to the impact of coronavirus on sales and supply-chain disruptions following the temporary closure of non-essential services.Apollo Tyres said chairman Onkar S Kanwar and vice-chairman Neeraj Kanwar will take a 25% cut in their remunerations, while the company’s senior management will take a reduction of 15%. The father and son drew a salary of Rs 39 crore and Rs 35 crore in fiscal 2019.Recently, Indigo Airlines, GoAir and Air India announced cutting of salaries and other benefits of their employees.

While SBI has been the first to launch the scheme, other public sector lenders are expected to follow suit soon.In a circular to branches, the bank said that CECL will be in the form of a demand loan with a term of 12 months to help meet temporary liquidity mismatch arising out of Covid-19. The facility will be available to all standard accounts which do not have overdues for over 30 days on March 16. Borrowers who have availed specialised loan products for small businesses are also eligible for the facility.The borrower can avail the sanctioned amount in one go and start instalments only after six months and complete repayments in the next six months. The borrower will, however, need to have stocks with market value enough to cover the additional limit. Industry bodies have been calling for additional funding for small business and a moratorium on loans so that borrowers are not classified as defaulters if they face liquidity problems during the period of shut down.According to bankers the panic in the financial markets risks translating into a credit freeze as lenders turn risk-averse.

MUMBAI: With shares of HDFC Bank falling sharply compared to the broader indices in the last two sessions, marketmen are pointing to a research report that cites among its concerns the way HDFC Bank has handled the CEO succession . Gautam Chhugani, an analyst at Sanford C Bernstein, said in a report that the bank had the highest exposure to unsecured consumer risk in a maturing consumer cycle and challenges with management succession. “It was imperative on the current CEO and HDFC Ltd as a large shareholder to build consensus over the last 2 years. Appointment of an executive search firm 7 months before the retirement date is unwarranted and irresponsible process management,” Chhugani said in a report.

UBS on Friday published a report authored by analyst Vishal Goyal whose observations were in contrast to the Bernstein report. “Trends in unsecured retail asset quality are stable. 80% of the unsecured loans are to salaried employees. This is majorly comprised of good and strong corporates and government employees,” said Goyal.

The UBS report was a short note following a conference call by the bank with analysts in the wake of the Covid-19 crisis. “The bank currently does not expect countrywide lockdown in India. Management is currently taking steps to minimize the impact of COVID-19 virus in branches,” the report said. It did not, however, touch upon the succession issue.

Aditya Puri, the only CEO HDFC Bank ever had will be retiring in end-October. Puri’s succession is the most anticipated changeover among the listed company given that he has built the country’s most valuable bank. The bank is part of the HDFC group which has the most valuable business in all the segments that it is present.

Puri is set to step down in October 2020 and the Reserve Bank of India requires the board to submit a recommendation at least three months before the incumbent’s term end to complete it `fit and proper’ assessment. In January HDFC Bank had confirmed that the board had appointed executive search firm Egon Zehender to help identify candidates.

Samrat felt marginalized in the party as his bid to contest for the Khagaria Lok Sabha seat was stymied last year, observers felt. Son of former minister and prominent Koeri caste leader Shakuni Choudhary, he had started his political career from RJD and later joined JD(U), when he was made MLC. He later switched to BJP.

Also dropped were MLC Nawal Kishore Yadav, Vishwa Mohan Kumar and Anand Jha as spokespersons and Mrityunjay Jha and Darbhanga MP Gopaljee Thakur as BJP state vice-presidents.

Jaiswal announced the names of 12 vice-presidents, four general secretaries, 12 state secretaries and nine spokespersons, besides that of district presidents and incharges of around two dozens of morchas and cells.

“The state and central leadership have given due consideration to caste, community and regional concerns in making the representation broad-based to ensure the victory of NDA candidates in the October-November assembly polls,” BJP’s state spokesman Prem Ranjan Patel said.

While Muzaffarpur MP Ajay Nishad, former Siwan MP Om Prakash Yadav, MLAs Mithilesh Tiwari and Baby Kumari, MLC Radha Mohan Sharma, former minister Nitish Mishra, former MLC Rajendra Gupta and former MLA Rajiv Ranjan have been made vice-presidents, the four general secretaries include ex-MP Janak Ram and MLA Sanjeev Chaurasia. The remaining vice-presidents would be Rajendra Singh, Pramod Chandravanshi and Pinki Kushwaha. Similarly, Devesh Kumar and Sushil Choudhary will be general secretaries.

Nagendra Ji has been retained as general secretary (organization) and Shivnarayan Mahto as co-general secretary (organization). While MLC Dilip Jaiswal has been retained as state treasurer, Ms Shyama Singh has been made co-treasurer. The ex-mayor of Patna, Roop Narayan Mehta and Amrita Bhushan have been made state secretaries.

Among the party’s spokespersons are MLA Manoj Sharma, former MLAs Prem Ranjan Patel and Sanjay Singh Tiger, Nikhil Anand, Akhilesh Singh, Vivekanand Paswan, Arwind Singh, Afjar Shamsi and Ram Sagar Singh. Lajwanti Jha has been made state Mahila Morcha president and Nivedita Singh its incharge.

Overall, those belonging to the Bhumihar caste have been given maximum representations in the list of office-bearers, followed by that of Vaishyas, Rajputs, Brahmins, backward caste, extremely backward caste, scheduled caste and scheduled tribe sections.

Those left out would be accommodated in the list of the state executive committee of around 300 members, including invitee members.

With another youth from Kolkata testing positive to the virus, the emergency wing of the hospital saw a mad rush of people wanting to get their swab samples tested on Friday. A police picket has been posted to prevent any chaos.“Going by the increasing volume of flyers, mostly from abroad, thronging the emergency, we see tough days ahead. On certain days, we are running out of beds and occasionally have to refer patients to other hospitals,” said a source at ID Hospital.On Friday, more than 300 people queued up at the emergency wing. Those who came from abroad were made to stand in a separate line. Doctors said most had turned up in panic. Eventually, only seven suspected patients were admitted during the day. “A day after the meeting with the chief minister, we got six doctors deputed from another hospital. This is a huge relief as we were running out of manpower,” said Anima Haldar, principal of the ID Hospital.The teaching hospitals have earmarked isolation beds and Mamata Banerjee has asked health officials to set up more such wards. But sources said that the isolation beds in other hospitals will not be as specific as the ones at ID Hospital. “For example, the 30 isolation beds that SSKM Hospital has created is in a maternity home. Though it is a satellite unit of the hospital, how can Covid-19 patients be treated in a maternity home that lacks basic infrastructure?” asked a health department official.Of the 1,420 internationals flyers who arrived on Friday, 377 were escorted to the quarantine facility in New Town to get screened before being allowed to either return home or stay quarantined there.All 207 passengers who arrived on flights originating in the Gulf were sent to the facility. This was the second day of compulsory quarantine for passengers arriving on Gulf flights. The remaining passengers to be sent to the quarantine centre on Friday included five who flew in from Germany and France on an Air India connecting flight from Delhi, 13 South Koreans who flew in by Thai Airways and one from China who arrived by Singapore Airlines.“Compulsory quarantine ensures a double check on arriving passengers — first at the airport by health officials and immigration officers and then by doctors at the quarantine centre.

Raju Kumar, the local chowkidar and a childhood friend of Akshay, said, “What Akshay did is definitely not praiseworthy, but his family has a good reputation in the village. The family members are very simple and gentle. Akshay’s father Sarayu Singh had three sons, the youngest of whom was Akshay. Saryu is a marginal farmer and the main source of his income is farming,” he added.

All the windows and doors of Saryu’s house were closed and no one was available to talk. Local mukhiya Malti Devi said whatever be the legal aspect of the case, the locals have all sympathy for Akshay’s widow Punita Devi and her child. Malti Devi’s son Rakesh Singh said, “Though there is no point discussing the case, we all feel for Akshay’s family, especially his child.”

This village hogged the limelight after Akshay's name surfaced in the Nirbhaya murder case. Sachit Singh, another villager, said Akshay came to this village in December 2012 and surrendered to the police. “The villagers now want to forget this chapter and move on,” he added.

The village falls under the Tandwa police station area of Navinagar block. Tandwa police station incharge Virendra Kumar Singh said though he has no official information, unofficial sources have confirmed that the Akshay’s body had been handed over to his family members.

However, work from home has been implemented by almost all the private sector institutions in the state.

“It is not possible for government officials to work from home as most of the paper works are done physically. Even files are moved from one table to another in the same old fashioned way,” said a senior bureaucrat. Another officer added, “Many of our employees are not tech-savvy and will not be able to work by using modern technology. So, those who even want to work from home have no option.”

However, government is trying its best to restrict gatherings at government offices. On Thursday, the general administration department (GAD) issued an order limiting entry of visitors in old secretariat, Vikas Bhavan, Visvesavaraya Bhavan, Technology Bhavan and Soochna Bhavan. The order stated that only important meetings will be allowed with the officials and that, too, after taking prior permission from the official concerned who should not be less than that of under secretary level. Again that official has to inform security at the entrance about the meeting. Earlier, visitors were allowed inside after getting a pass made at the entrance.

This order will comply till March 31 as of now. Prem Chand Singh, DSP (Sachivalaya security) said the footfall has drastically dropped on secretariat premises after the GAD order. “Earlier, not less than thousand people used to come everyday. Today I have not seen any visitor,” said Singh, who was monitoring near Vikas Bhawan in early afternoon.

He further said even staff on duty were taking precautionary measures while entering the premises. “Health department has deployed staff to ensure those entering inside first sanitize their hands. In fact, people have become aware and are coming forward and sanitizing their hands,” said Singh.

GAD had on previous Friday ordered all the departments to prepare a roster system for group C and D employees and call them on alternate days to office.

60,['21/03/2020'],Rajasthan: 69-year-old Italian tourist cured of coronavirus dies of cardiac arrest,"The Italian was the first person who tested positive for Covid-19 at the Sawai Man Singh Hospital

JAIPUR: A pall of gloom descended on Sawai Man Singh (SMS) hospital doctors, after the news of death of 69-year-old Italian tourist, who was declared as cured from Covid-19 on March 15, broke out. He died of cardiac arrest in a private hospital on Friday. He was the first person tested positive for Covid-19 at the Sawai Man Singh hospital of the state.

“I am heartbroken. He responded well to our treatment and he recovered from the disease. It was a wonderful feeling with he defeated Covid-19. Even though he was shifted from the SMS hospital to a private hospital on Thursday, I stayed connected with the doctors of the private hospital. But, it came as a shock for all of us as he died early morning,” said Dr Prakash Keswani, treating doctor at SMS hospital of the Italian tourist.

Even though, Italian couple did not know English, the doctors understood what he tries to understand from his sign language. “He did not know English and we do not know Italian, despite of that we understood each other’s sign language,” said Dr DS Meena, medical superintendent, SMS hospital.

He underwent treatment for Covid-19 and chronic bronchitis, a pre-exisitng disease, at the SMS hospital. It was a moment of joy and happiness for the SMS hospital doctor, when he was tested negative for Covid-19 in two successive tests done on March 14 and March 15. Following that, SMS hospital proudly declared that the Italian tourist has been cured from Covid-19, but they asserted that he required further treatment for his pre-existing lung disease.

His treatment for ventilation for lung disease was continued along with antibiotics, oxygen (non-invasive ventilation) at SMS hospital after being shifted from isolation ward to emergency ICU on March 16 (next day after he declared free from Covid-19).

He was part of 23-member Italian tourists, who landed at Delhi airport on March 20. He was accompanied with his wife, who was also diagnosed with the disease on March 4, next day after her husband was diagnosed with the disease on March 3.

After touring Mandawa (Jhunjhunu), Bikaner, Jaisalmer, Jodhpur and Udaipur, he reached Jaipur on February 28. He stayed along with his group at a hotel in Raja Park area. Since he felt difficulty in breathing and mild fever, he was rushed to a private hospital on JLN Road. After admission in the hospital, due to suspicion of Covid-19, he was referred to SMS hospital. The doctors admitted him to isolation ward. In the first test on March 29, he was tested negative for Covid-19. But, in second test on March 2, he was diagnosed with the disease. On March 3, National Institute of Virology, Pune confirmed that he had been infected with Covid-19. The doctors immediately shifted him to isolation ward and started the treatment.

He was undergoing treatment at SMS hospital before he was shifted to a private hospital on Thursday.

Treatment was continued and the patient was stable, the SMS hospital claimed. On March 17, patient was stable on oxygen with non invasive ventilator support and due to fear of fatigue, he was advised for intubation which his wife refused and she insisted for transfer to the private hospital, from where they were brought earlier to SMS hospital for further treatment. “Italian ambassador to India also contacted us and requested that the patient be transferred to the private hospital,” said additional chief secretary (health) Rohit Kumar Singh.

On Wednesday, his parameters were well maintained, the health department claimed saying that on Friday, a team of the private hospital came for transfer for further management of co-morbidity at their facility. They advised for intubation at SMS hospital only for transfer. Patient was intubated. There was a slight fall of blood pressure after intubation. BP was maintained on noradrenaline infusion. After stabilisation of the patient, he was in supervision of the private hospital team and was transferred to the hospital with discharge summary.

Officials said that his wife asserted that she is satisfied with the treatment given at SMS hospital and appreciated the team of doctors of SMS hospital. As per the feedback from the private hospital, patient’s death has occurred due to heart failure.

JAIPUR: While CM Ashok Ghelot on Thursday said MGNREGA workers need not come to the work site till March 31 and would be paid their wages during the shutdown period, the department has put up a file before the CMO saying “the decision violates the provisions of the Act and urged it to bring out a fresh direction.”

An official said the MGNREGA workers can’t be deprived of work under the Act.

“Under the MGNREGA Act, it is not permitted to pay wages to workers without coming to the site. Therefore, in such a case, if the workers are to be paid wages without coming to work, the cost has to be borne by the state government. Till March 31, the total wages would amount to Rs 301 crore. The government of India will not pay the wages to the workers,” said an official.

“Taking the matter into cognizance, the Centre has sought the government’s statement issued on Thursday. They also stated that the order was against the law,” said the official.

The chief minister on Thursday directed that NREGA workers need not come to the work site till March 31 and they would be paid their wages during the shutdown period.

62,['21/03/2020'],‘One crime one data’ system operational in Bihar,"Representative image

PATNA: Bihar has set an example by introducing ‘One crime one data’ system in the country. It is a software to connect all police stations, courts and jails in the country through a networking system.

IG (Prisons) Mithilesh Mishra said on Friday that with its introduction, the criminals’ data can be accessed from one place. “If a criminal commits a crime and moves from one state to another, the police will know everything about him through this system,” he said.

Elaborating the benefits of the new system, the IG said all the data entered in this system will be available with the NIC centre in Delhi. NIC can be considered as a server for ‘One crime one data’ system throughout the country.

“As soon as the police apprehend a criminal, they have to feed the criminal’s name, address and his criminal history in the software. Apart from this, the court and jail will also have to feed the data of the criminal in the software. Even if a criminal gets bail, his data will still be present in the ‘One crime one data’ system’,” Mishra said.

On February 26, a workshop was organized at Hajipur in Vaishali district by the prison directorate to impart training to the computer literate personnel of all the 59 jails in the state. The IG (Prisons) said all the jails in the state were equipped with computers and connected to the prison directorate through internet.

Mishra said once a criminal is arrested and produced before the court, there is no need to send all his or her relevant documents to the jail authorities. Only the case (FIR) number will serve the purpose,’ he clarified.

He further said the system will also reduce the chances of discrepancy as biometric information of the criminal concerned is collected at the jail. “Once the new system becomes operational, additional pressure of transferring the relevant documents from one office to another will automatically reduce on the staff,” he added.

According to authoritative sources, all the jails and courts have already been connected with the new software. “The rest is the work for the police, who have to feed the data of the arrested criminals,” a senior prisons department officer said.

All the police stations under Patna and Nalanda districts have already started the process of feeding the data on the new system.

Gardanibagh police station SHO Arvind Kumar Gautam said two trained personnel — one from the police department and another from the company assigned to implement the CCTNS in the state — have been deputed at the police station to upload the FIR and the case diary.

“The new system has helped the police keep the documents updated and also eased the pressure of keeping old files at the police station. Every information is now available at the click of a mouse,” he said.

Meanwhile, a committee has been set up in the state home department to monitor the proper implementation of the new software. Police and jails come under the home department and CM Nitish Kumar is holding the home portfolio.

65,['21/03/2020'],Coronavirus Vaccine India: 'Coronavirus drug in 6 months after producing API',"More on Covid-19

MUMBAI: Mumbai-based drug major Cipla , credited with several innovations especially in respiratory and flu therapy, could well become one of the first domestic companies to roll out new drugs for the coronavirus . The company is both fast-tracking development of these drugs with government laboratories, and repurposing its wide portfolio of respiratory, asthma, anti-virals and HIV drugs to meet challenges arising from Covid-19 in India.“We consider it a nationalistic duty to put all our resources to benefit the country,” Cipla promoter Yusuf Hamied told TOI in an exclusive interview. He added the company is doubling production of these therapies. Cipla already distributes Swiss company Roche’s anti-inflammatory drug Actemra in India, which can be used in patients with severe lung problems, he added, listing other respiratory therapies which can be used, if the medical fraternity decides.This assumes significance as Cipla’s strength in respiratory, anti-flu and HIV drugs is well-established, as all three are believed to be effective in the present situation, though there is not enough data at present to establish them as treatments.Cipla, instrumental in making healthcare affordable by launching copies of AIDS, cancer and other life-saving drugs in the past, was also one of the first companies to launch generic treatment for H1N1 influenza in recent years. Significantly, Actemra, used in rheumatoid arthritis, has been approved by China recently for patients with severe complications of Covid-19, while Roche is initiating trials to evaluate its safety and efficacy in hospitalised patients with severe Covid-19 pneumonia in the first such global study.At present, there is no treatment for Covid-19. While clinical data on HIV, anti-virals, and anti-malarials for treating coronavirus patients is yet to be established, with over 10,000 deaths globally, experimental drugs and combinations are being used.Elaborating on new drugs, Hamied said development of promising anti-viral compounds — favipiravir, remidesivir and bolaxavir, will be initiated to treat Covid-19. “We are looking into how to produce raw materials (active pharmaceutical ingredients) with the help of government laboratories for these drugs,” he said, adding, it will take six months to launch after procurement of raw materials.The coronavirus mainly infects lungs, and the company has a range of asthma drugs including Foracort, Seroflo, Duolin and Aerocort and certain nebuliser respules to treat asthma, which can be used as supplements, he said. (A respule is a small plastic container that contains a liquid, which is put into a machine called a nebuliser for treating asthma and other respiratory diseases).“We have a wide range in our portfolio — we do not know what medicine/combination will work. It is the doctor’s discretion,” he said. Drugs which have shown promise, and are now part of a global trial, include antiviral drug remedesivir, a combination of two HIV drugs, lopinavir and ritonavir; lopinavir and ritonavir plus interferon beta; and antimalarial drug chloroquine.Cipla already manufactures Lopimune tablets, a combination of lopinavir and ritonavir, and is keenly watching the developments. Earlier, the Drug Controller General had approved the ‘restricted use’ of a combination of anti-HIV drugs for treating those affected by Covid-19, after ICMR sought an emergency approval for the use of ‘lopinavir’ and ‘ritonavir’ combinations.On the availability of these critical drugs, Hamied said, “We have enough in India right now. But if it becomes a cluster or community transmission, then it could be a problem. We are worried about the uncertainty (of the virus and its spread)”. The US has just approved the use of anti-malarial drug chloroquine as a treatment, while France is studying a combination of hydroxychloroquine, a popular anti-malaria drug, and antibiotic azithromycin. Both are plenty in India, Hamied said. The company is working closely with the government including Indian Council of Medical Research director general Balram Bhargava, Drugs Controller General V G Somani, and Indian Institute of Chemical Technology scientists.",business,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74741318,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-153725,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/virus-drug-in-6-mths-after-producing-api/articleshow/74740063.cms

``I was waiting anxiously for the PM’s speech on Thursday night and later saw news scroll on TV that big shops would be closed. I prayed that our neighbourhood grocer will be there in the morning,’’ said Savithiri who had decided to buy her groceries in bulk anticipating a major shutdown.

Many people who wnt out in the morning to purchase vegetables as usual were also seen buying provision like sugar, flour and rava which led to longer waits in the shops. However, many others like Karuppanan of Anna Nagar said he didn’t know anything about it and was sorry that he did not stock up. Small shops at Vilangudi, Anna Nagar, Villapuram, Avaniapuram, Chinthamani and other parts of the city went on a stocking spree on Friday to meet the demand. ``We cannot deny things to our customers so we have also brought a bigger stock of essential items including washing liquids, detergents, sugar, flour and even eggs,’’ said Samy of K K Nagar.

“With the children at home, we also need a lot of ingredients for making other eatables like cakes and biscuits. We decided to visit the Nilgiris store in K K Nagar for this and was quite surprised to find it closed on Friday,’’ said Jansi , a teacher who has also been told to work from home.

Farmers’ markets and the Madurai central vegetable market also saw a big crowd with people vying with each other to purchase essentials, potatoes, onions and tomatoes. Chaos prevailed at the weekly market on bypass road when the corporation officials asked the vendors to clear the spots saying there is no permission for weekly markets till March 31.

Khaunte also accused Sawant of working as per the directions of the BJP’s national leadership and not as per Goa’s interests.

“The chief minister has failed on all grounds to deliver to the people of Goa,” said Khaunte. The Porvorim MLA addressed a press conference on Friday to highlight the flaws of the BJP-led government.

Khaunte said that under Sawant’s watch, the state had seen its debt climb to new highs, rising unemployment, Karnataka weaken Goa’s claim on the Mhadei river water and increase in crimes. “The last one year has brought out the incompetency, weak administration and the failures of this chief minister. It has exposed the casual approach towards Mhadei, where he is working as a remote control for the Centre,” said Khaunte.

The domestic terminal will continue to function but the buzz will remain conspicuously absent as flyer count continues to fall. While at least 50 domestic flights are expected to be cancelled on Sunday, with uncertainty over Monday’s situation, many retail and food and beverage outlets at the facility are beginning to down shutters.“The count of departing passengers in the international wing had declined from over 4,000 a day to barely 300-400 before international flights go off the radar from Sunday morning. Though the facility has been undergoing regular fumigation and clean-up, now that it will be closed, we will be able to undertake a thorough sanitizaton,” an official said. With the possibility of many passengers who passed through the facility being asymptomatic Covid-19 carriers, the clean-up is in order.Food and beverage, and retail units that are dependant on departing passengers are bleeding with hardly any sales. As they prepared to shut down on Saturday, many were uncertain when they would reopen. Though the closure has been notified for a week, many of them believe that the lockdown could remain in place for quite some time as there is no end in sight to the global pandemic yet.“We are clearing everything from the shop as I don’t really see passengers wanting to shop any time in the near future. I fear the virus may change the psyche of travellers forever. The aviation industry as a whole will struggle long after the pandemic is over,” said a retailer.The slump in footfalls had led to the closure of ABC Bar , three outlets each of Capuccino and Biryani Bhai, and Cafe Coffee Day at the international lounge even before Saturday. In the domestic wing, too, Noodle Wok, Banchharam and Anex Lounge have shut shop.Faced with virtually no revenue, the retail master concessionaires has asked the Airports Authority of India for a fee waiver. Welcome Retail, a joint venture of Travel News Services India (a subsidiary of Kishore Biyani’s Future Retail) and Flemingo Retail that individually operates duty-free shops at the airport is the master concessionare for retail outlets. Even Travel Food Services , the master concessionare for food and beverage, has asked for a discount on the fees as the drop in footfall has led to a decline in sales.“Food and beverage outlets can still operate in the domestic wing, but there will hardly be any sales in retail as no one is really in a mood to buy anything beyond what is absolutely essential. The battering may force many outlets to shut down permanently. Kolkata airport had become a lively place only in the past year. Now, when this crisis is over, it will have to again pick up the pieces and perhaps start from scratch,” an expert said.Retail, food and beverage and advertising account for 20% of the airport’s earnings. Non-aviation revenue in 2017-18, rose to Rs 265 crore from Rs 199 crore in 2016-17.

KOLKATA: The death of a 13-year-old boy from Behala’s Bakultala at the Vidyasagar Hospital late on Friday has triggered a controversy with his family claiming it to be a case of medical negligence. They lodged a case of negligence against the doctor . A post-mortem has been conducted.

Police said Sudipta Das had been vomiting since Friday morning. A few hours later, he was taken to the emergency ward with mild fever. He was reportedly administered an injection, after which his condition worsened. When the family demanded the doctor who administered the drug be alerted, the nurses told them no doctor or bed was available. He passed away at 10.55pm.

After the death, the family almost came to blows with hospital security and the cops could defuse the situation two hours later only after promising a fair probe. “We registered a case and since there was no major clash, the hospital did not register any counter complaint,” said DC (Behala) Nilanjan Biswas .

The hospital denied the charges saying he was brought in a critical condition and the family had been kept in the loop.

72,['21/03/2020'],OTT platforms see increased viewership and new sign ups,"Chennai: As work from home becomes the norm, and social entertainment — like movie halls — shuts, increasing number of people are turning to online video consumption.

While, MX Player has witnessed a 2X increase in OTT viewership, companies such as Zee5 and VOOT are seeing an increase in new sign ups.

Karan Bedi, CEO - MX Player observed, “With the health advisory in place, Indians are increasingly turning to the digital realm to fulfill their dose of digital entertainment.” While video consumption on OTT platforms is higher, there is a jump in consumption on TVs rather than mobiles. “Interestingly, we have seen a jump of over 10% in the consumption of our original content and over 5% for TV content via connected devices like Amazon Fire Stick and on Smart TVs,” said Tarun Katial, CEO, ZEE5 India

Video Analytics firm Vidooly sees a 20% jump in video consumption on OTT platforms in the last 10 days. A report from Nokia shows that an average user spends 70 minutes a day on OTT platforms on a regular day.

Besides the spike in viewership, the platforms are also seeing an increase in subscription numbers. Zee5 reports that their new subscriptions are up by over 10% compared to the previous weekend. Another OTT platform VOOT, which recently introduced VOOT select earlier this month is seeing 3x increase in their subscription numbers compared to their projections.

“People have a lot more time to consume videos and therefore they are watching videos across all digital platforms. If the current situation continues for prolonged period of time, it will lead to people gravitating towards new content on OTT platforms,” said Ferzad Palia, head - Voot Select.

“In the era of social distancing and limiting exposure to the external world, consumers and viewers are turning to forms of digital entertainment and Eros Now is playing it’s part. We have seen an increase of 100% on registered users and now touching 200% increase in paid subscribers on a daily basis,” said Ali Hussein, CEO, Eros Now.

Keeping with the spike in demand, firms are expanding features to keep their audience engaged. Netflix has launched Netflix Party that helps users watch shows together from remote locations.

There are chances that you would be given a desktop or be turned away as rental firms and dealers have run out of stock. Corporates, startups and individuals rushed to these dealers armed with requests, all together and all too sudden. While some of the dealers have increased their rentals by 30%. “From Rs 2,500 a month for normal demand, the rates have now gone up to Rs 4,000 for a month and we have given out up to 200 pieces over the past week,” said N Raja, owner, Lexicon systems in Padi, which has customers across Ambattur Industrial Estate. “We usually have 100-200 in stock and can manage if companies come in with requests for 15-20. We have emptied our stocks now,” said an employee from KK-Nagar based laptop rental service Chennai Systems and Services.

Anticipating this situation, city-based startups such as SunnyBee began placing orders in advance. “We have been placing orders more than a month ago when infections in India just started. Luckily, we didn’t have to pay a premium,” said CEO Sanjay Dasari.

To battle soaring rentals, some individuals and companies are also tapping into de-boned or refurbished laptops. Rohit Bagaria, founder, Budli.in also adds that they have run out of stock. “IT startups and SMEs are looking to cut down on cost, when they are already dealing with unexpected expenses. Our rentals are at Rs 1,500 to Rs 2,000 a month, almost half of the rentals for the new ones,” he said.

Some customers have an issue with de-boned ones as they operate on Linux, a freeware as against a more preferred Windows.

74,['21/03/2020'],Share of diesel vehicles shrinks to just 15%,"Chennai: Falling crude oil prices and narrowing gap between petrol and diesel pump price has resulted in fewer diesel cars as a percentage of total cars sold in the country.

From 60% of the passenger vehicle market in 2011-12, diesel’s share fell to 42% in 2016 and 32% in the current financial year. Last month, that share shrank to around 15%.

This shrinkage in the middle of an already slowing market is mostly due to fuel prices. On May 21, 2011-12, the price difference between petrol and diesel reached its highest point at Rs 31. This gap came down to Rs 18.5 in 2013, less than Rs 15 in 2015-17, Rs 10.1 in 2017-18. Last year it was down to Rs 7.1 and this year the weighted average is about Rs 6.5.

In many states including Gujarat, Odisha, Goa and Chattirgarh, petrol is cheaper than diesel.

Predominantly diesel companies are now looking at at petrol for entry level segments.

“Diesel vehicles are becoming expensive due to the technology that goes in to meet the BS6 emission norms. As a result, the entry level segment is shifting to gasoline. The value buyer is moving to gasoline but the fun, more premium buyer still wants the high torque diesel,” said Rajan Wadhera, president-auto sector, M&M.

M&M, will have a 1.2 litre petrol but the 1.5 litre engine will be both petrol as well as diesel. “We will have both petrol and diesel engines in the B-segment,” said Wadhera.

Diesel vehicle makers are passing on the price markup step by step. “In the price sensitive of entry and mid passenger car segment diesel upgrade to BS6 makes is uncompetitive against the equivalent gasoline vehicles. The difficult decision that we as manufacturer of MPV and SUV vehicles was how to price these BS6 diesel vehicles at introduction timing. In our case we had taken a decision to transfer less than 50% of BS6 upgradation cost to the market at introduction timing earlier this year. However since this is not a sustainable measure we would take a decision at appropriate time to transfer the cost to the market in a step wise manner,” said Naveen Soni, VP-Toyota Kirloskar Motor.

Currently, the cost per km for petrol vehicle is about Rs 3.4-Rs 3.5 per km whereas the cost for diesel vehicles is Rs 2.70-2.80 per km. Given the Rs 1.2-Rs 1.8 lakh price differential in BS6 avatar, it would now take longer to amortise the diesel premium.

Of course, despite its shrinking influence, car companies are chary of letting go of diesel altogether. Even Maruti which has currently moved out of diesel may reconsider if need be.

“Some customers may still prefer diesel and if we find a preference for diesel, then Maruti will consider a BS6 option in larger diesel vehicle category,” said Shashank Srivastava, executive director (Marketing & Sales), Maruti Suzuki India.

The HC said it was not against performing of rituals like puja/aarti/service/namaz, but the rituals should take place without making the places open to public.A bench headed by chief justice Vikram Nath said, “If people out of their sentiments continue to gather in large number at places of worship, entire efforts to take precautionary measures for spread of Covid-19 would be frustrated.” Therefore, the judges requested people “to refrain from visiting their places of worship and offer their prayer/puja/service from home instead of gathering at the place of worship”.After the request to people, came the court order for the authorities of all district and cities, “... all the District Magistrates/Commissioners of Police and Superintendents of Police of all the districts and quarters of the State of Gujarat to ensure that no gathering takes place at any of the places of worship in the State. We however do not mean that the daily puja/aarti/service/offering of prayer (namaz) may be stopped in such places of worship but the management of all the religious places of worship may perform it without making it open to public.”Besides, the HC directed the state government and various quasi-judicial authorities like Gujarat Real Estate Regulation Authority and its appellate body, the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) that they may not insist on hearing till March 31 in all matters and conduct urgent hearing only.

The boards of companies including Dalmia, Sterlite Technologies , Praj industries will meet over the next few days to consider a share buy-back. Normally, companies undertake a share buy back when it feels its share prices are undervalued. Besides, a share repurchase can demonstrate to investors that the business has sufficient cash set aside for emergencies. Over the past two weeks, stock prices have crashed across the board as investors panic over the real impact of the corona virus remains elevated.The boards of Dalmia, Motilal Oswal and Ramkrishna Forgings will meet on Saturday (March 21) to consider a share buy-back, the companies announced stock exchanges. Other companies board including Sterlite Technologies, Kalpataru Power will meet on Tuesday to consider the proposal. “Share buyback is just one of the means by which you reward your shareholders, as the buyback results in better price to book and price to earnings. This is also kind of the means by which the cash which the company is having with it is utilized when it is not really required for any business expansion or development purpose,” said Joseph Thomas, head of research at Emkay Wealth Management. Emami’s board approved a share buy back at a maximum price of Rs 300 apiece on Thursday. The company’s current price is Rs 184. An Emami official said, “Our stock is now available at a very cheap price. The company is over Rs 1,900 crore in reserves. This can be utilised to buy shares from investors. I am confident that the market will welcome this. It is an investor-friendly measure,” the official said. Emami has an average EBITA of Rs 720-Rs 730 crore for the last few years. “There is a point where the intrinsic value of the asset turns higher than the market price. That is where the turnaround happens in the markets. That is also the time when buybacks make immense sense as a measure of support to build confidence. Calculations regarding organizational requirements are made before such actions are contemplated and implemented,” Emkay’s Thomas said. For instance, the share price of Dalmia has crashed 41% in the past month, while that of Motilal Oswal is down 27% and Ramkrishna Forgings is down nearly 50%.",business,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-47529300,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-110164,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/as-stock-prices-crash-cos-look-at-share-buy-back/articleshow/74739156.cms

83,['21/03/2020'],Working at home &amp; missing office chats,"MUMBAI/BENGALURU: From digital meetings and IT support teams offering solutions on-the-go to companies planning online town halls and large group video conferences — organisations and their HR departments are working towards making ‘work-from-home’ (WFH) a seamless experience for employees.In the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic, most employers have already implemented telecommuting policies. But the challenge is keeping employees motivated and productive. In a virtual WFH world, employees can no longer have informal ‘chats’ across physical desks of co-workers, or have conversations at intersections like water coolers and coffee machines.To ensure this doesn’t demotivate employees, some companies are enabling video calls that go beyond work-related matters to emotionally connect with employees and create informal “chit-chats”.Society for Human Resource Management (SHRM) associate director (knowledge & advisory services) Ashish Kaul said, “Most employers are in a frantic mode right now, worried about their businesses getting impacted. We are telling companies to be more compassionate and cognizant about the fact that not all employees may be comfortable working from home as it’s a new environment. Conversations employees have in a physical office go beyond work. Some companies are enabling informal chats on video calls to emotionally connect with employees.”To engage its employees who are working from home, Siemens India plans to use the intranet to put out stories of employees working at its factories and in business-critical roles who report to work everyday. “We plan to bring these stories alive, of people who are in the frontline, working hard to ensure the company keeps going. When employees see these stories, they would certainly get motivated to do even better,” said a Siemens India spokesperson. The company also has its own audio-video chat system that is actively used by employees to stay connected.Software company Amdocs said it launched an internal platform that provides solutions on remote working well-being and parenting. The remote working solutions support development teams working from home and solutions for virtual teamwork, including remote management, advanced multi-participant video-conferencing and real-time content sharing, as well as a variety of digital and collaborative learning platforms.Experts are advising companies that no amount of communication during this critical phase will be termed over-communication. “We are communicating much more frequently through daily updates to offer as much clarity as we can, and also to get feedback,” said Godrej Industries Limited and Associate Companies (GILAC) group HR head Sumit Mitra. In the week ahead, the group plans to host online town halls and larger group video conferences.SAP Labs India senior vice-president and managing director Sindhu Gangadharan said, “Culturally, we Indians are a gregarious lot and also prefer to work in teams rather than isolation. Hence, for many, prolonged work from home becomes a challenge as they miss their routine, bonding with their teams and mingling with their social circles. For some, balancing their work with the pressures of being in a home with other members of the family, especially small children, becomes an issue. We constantly communicate with our employees on how to deal with some of the challenges they encounter.”However, manufacturing companies and employees working in a team-based set-up could face practical challenges. Nishith Desai Associates head HR laws (employment & labour) Vikram Shroff said managing performance while working from home may not be easy and may require employers to implement new HR software tools. “Confidentiality of client information continues to remain a key concern. But this coronavirus pandemic might hopefully and eventually bring a change in the entire organisation’s mindset that it’s not me against you, but we are all together,” said Shroff.",business,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74740078,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-104611,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/working-at-home-missing-office-chats/articleshow/74740079.cms
84,['21/03/2020'],Mutual Fund companies demand RBI credit line for short-term funds,"MUMBAI: There is a growing demand for measures by the Reserve Bank of India ( RBI ) to support the mutual fund industry, which is facing redemptions in short-duration debt market funds.The central bank had stepped in during the 2008 global financial crisis , industry players said. The steps could include opening a line of credit for fund houses so that managers don’t sell debt papers at whatever price they get, which pulls down prices.Top fund industry officials want the RBI to move to support the commercial paper market just like US Fed last week announced to support the commercial paper (CP) market there. In India, the CP market is already showing some stress with the yield of some of the top rated papers now up by about two percentage points since the start of the month. Since yields on a debt instrument is inversely related to its price, the prices of these papers have fallen drastically during the same time.During the peak of 2008 crisis which also affected India’s credit market, the RBI had allowed fund houses to borrow from it and face their redemptions rather than going for fire sale of their portfolio, which could have led to a crash in prices of those papers. Once the stress subsided and redemptions came back to the normal level, the fund houses repaid the money they had taken from the RBI.“It (an RBI credit line) will certainly help. Even if the line isn’t used, just the fact that it is there will deter investors from panicking,” said a top fund manager. Although fund managers are yet to go into a fire sell mode, “a liquidity backstop will bring back order in the (MF) industry ,” the fund manager said.According to Amfi’s February 2020 data, short term funds — that included overnight, liquid, ultra short duration, low duration, money market and short duration funds — together were managing money worth nearly Rs 9 lakh crore, translating to about 31% of the MF industry’s total assets.",business,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74744753,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-51368,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/mf-cos-demand-rbi-credit-line-for-short-term-funds/articleshow/74740105.cms
85,['21/03/2020'],"In Kolkata, desperate &amp; foreigners pay through the nose to fly home before ban","KOLKATA: With less than 24 hours to the complete ban on international flights, foreigners desperate to fly out paid astronomical sums for a seat on flights that are still half-empty. That’s because there were hardly any seats left in the subsequent leg to Europe, South America or Africa departing the Gulf cities.An Argentine student who had arrived in Kolkata in August 2019 and wanted to return to Buenos Aires had to pay Rs 1.4 lakh. Even after paying what would be the maximum return fare for a one-way flight, the journey could be fraught with uncertainties as new advisories issued daily by different countries continue to play havoc with flight schedules.A Spanish national of Indian origin who had to return to Madrid to his family coughed up Rs 60,000 when the usual fare is less than Rs 30,000.“The fares are incredibly high because of the surge in demand for seats out of the airline hubs like Dubai, Abu Dhabi and Doha. Flights are shutting down across the world. Already, Australia, New Zealand, The Philippines, Spain and France have gone into lockdown to break the virus chain. Snapping links by stopping flights has emerged as a weapon to counter the spread of the virus. Given the uncertainties of when flights across the world will normalize operations, those who are outside their homes have pressed the panic button and are now desperate to pay any amount to book a ticket,” said Travel Agents Federation of India chairman (east) Anil Punjabi.Travel agent Jaideep Mukherjee said several engineers who had come from abroad to commission projects at a steel plant had been quarantined in Raipur.“Some of them who were allowed to leave paid a fortune to rush back. On Friday, one took a flight to Dusseldorf for Rs 78,000 and another to Zurich for Rs 87,000,” he recounted.On Saturday, for the last flights depart Kolkata, the fare to Dusseldorf or Zurich has increased to Rs 1.1 lakh. For London and Paris, the fare shot up to Rs 1.2 lakh.Domestic fares, too, remained high despite low demand as airlines appeared to have shut down the algorithm-based fare matrix that gradually increases fares as flights fill up and the demand persists. “Domestic carriers appear to be deliberately keeping the fares high as there is only need-based travel now. People will not be enticed to travel if fares drop. Nor will someone who is desperate to go to another city be deterred by the high fare. Hence, even when a flight is about to depart and half the seats are empty, the fare isn’t dropping. It’s a very unusual situation,” said travel agent Manoj Saraf.At the airport, passenger movement touched a record low in recent years with less than 200 international passengers and 16,000 domestic passengers departing the city on Friday.

PATNA: Pramod Kumar, a sub-inspector (SI) of police, was arrested from Rohtas district on Friday for his alleged links with illicit liquor smugglers. The action against the SI was initiated on the directive of the state police headquarters, which had earlier received a complaint.

Pramod, posted with the Nokha police station in Rohtas district, was produced before a court at Sasaram, which remanded him to judicial custody for 14 days. Confirming the arrest, Rohtas SP Satyaveer Singh said that some incriminating documents were seized during search of his rented accomodation.

Authoritative sources said that Pramod had intercepted a mini truck carrying 120 cartons of India-made foreign liquor (IMFL) near Jhakui bridge on Wednesday night. Later he struck a deal with the liquor smuggler, who had booked the consignment. The matter somehow reached the top police officers posted at the police headquarters, who ordered a probe.

During preliminary investigation, the allegation against the police officer was found true, which led to his arrest on Friday. Sources said that Pramod was carrying out his operation from a rice mill, which was also searched by the raiding team.

Earlier, the then DSP of Dehri Anwar Javed had recommended disciplinary action against Pramod when he was posted as SHO of Tilauthu police station in Rohtas district. Pramod was removed from Tilauthu police station and subsequently posted as junior sub-inspector at Nokha police station.

On Wednesday night, DGP Gupteshwar Pandey had ordered the suspension of the SHO of Sarai police station, Dharmajeet Mahto, in Vaishali district for his alleged connection with liquor mafia.

Mahto against whom departmental proceedings were initiated on Vaishali SP Gaurav Mangla’s instruction, will be relieved of posting as SHO for a period of 10 years.

“All passengers will be thermal-screened and taken to the state quarantine facility for further checks,” said a senior official.

However, airport officials said international flights could depart from the city during the lockdown if foreign governments take permission to evacuate their stranded citizens. Indian national carrier Air India had operated evacuation flights to fly out Indians stuck in China and Iran.

Acting on pleas from various CMs, including Mamata Banerjee, to shut down international flights, citing that some of the flyers were asymptomatic Covid-19 carriers, the PIB had issued a notification on Thursday to shut all international commercial flights for a week from March 22.

Airport officials said that with international arrivals closed, the focus of thermal screening passengers will shift entirely to the domestic wing. Till Saturday, a team of 14 doctors and 30 paramedics had been checking passengers coming in from international destinations and had been providing a daily report to the state government and the health ministry.

“The screening at the domestic terminal is prim-arily being done by the state. Now that there will be no international flights, the airport health officials can supervise and advise the health workers on the screening process,” an official said.

PUNE: After several flight delays, being stranded in San Jose and overcoming other trauma, the actors of Amar Photo Studio, a popular Marathi play, who had to cut short their tour of the US is back home.

They could perform just three of the 15 shows lined up over 35-40 days. The entire team has been coming in batches. Actor Amey Wagh was part of the second batch that arrived on Thursday. The first batch landed on Wednesday and the third was in transit.

Wagh said it has been traumatic since the decision to cancel the shows was made. “We have never in our careers cancelled shows for any reason. I have stood on the stage despite being operated on my legs, members have performed despite deaths in the family, unwell artists have performed scenes with a nurse monitoring them in the wing. We believe the show must go on. So the decision to come back half way was painful, but it was a social responsibility,” he said.

The troupe has had to bear economic losses too. He was stranded in San Jose and had to put up at his relatives till the travel plans to Pune were sorted out. The stores had run out of bread, milk and eggs, he added.

“I was to fly back but the airline had to reschedule my ticket when suddenly there was an announcement by the carrier that all flights were cancelled. There was no chance of rescheduling. Our calls never got through and there were no responses to e-mails. We had to drive to the airport and there was nobody to address our queries. After a two-and-a-half-hour wait, an airline official helped us. We had several cancellations in this period and there was a time when we sat in the plane for take off and 15 minutes later that flight was cancelled,” he said.

He finally got a flight three days ago and landed in Mumbai safely and was out within one hour after the mandatory health check. He was not allowed to come back to Pune as a precautionary measure.

Fellow actor Parna Pethe , among the first to arrive in Pune, travelled for almost 40 hours. She said international airports were vacant.

“At Mumbai airport, there was a separate queue for those with symptoms. In these times of crisis, there is a feeling of unity among all people,” she said.

She has quarantined herself after reaching Pune. “I have isolated myself. My partner, Alok, is in self-isolation at his parents’ house. We will not be meeting for 15 days as a precaution. I am not moving out of my house and I have told my house help to take leave,” she added.

She plans to watch films and web series, cook and clean the house which makes her self-dependent. Parna stays in the same society on Sinhagad Road where the first Covid-19 couple from Pune live. She said the members and office bearers have been cooperative.

“They have supported me and I am staying here despite coming from abroad. I have heard so many stories of people being ill-treated and facing stigma from society members out of panic. I have felt welcomed here,” she added.

NASHIK: The Nashik Municipal Corporation ( NMC ) has cancelled the agreement of 13 central kitchen contractors from the next academic year owing to violations of terms and conditions.

The contractors were responsible for providing mid-day meals to municipal schools for three years. “They (the contractors) will continue to provide meal until the summer vacation,” a senior NMC official said, adding that action against the contractors was taken following directives by municipal commissioner Radhakrishna Game.

On February 18, city mayor Satish Kulkarni — for the second time in the general body meeting — had directed the civic administration to cancel the contracts of the 13 erring contractors providing mid-day meals to municipal schools in the city.

During the GB meeting, Shiv Sena’s Ajay Boraste, leader of opposition in the House, had raised the issue of how these central kitchen contractors are violating the norms.

Boraste also provided evidence by showing letters sent by principals of 13 municipal schools, complaining about the food being served to the students.

Some students had also complained of health-related issues after eating the daal served to them at the school. The principal of the concerned school had lodged a complaint with the education department.

Education officer Devidas Mahajan also admitted about this incident after Boraste informed the House by showing the complaint letter sent by the school principal. Some school principals had also complained about inadequate quantity of the meal being provided to the students.

Taking cognizance of this, Kulkarni directed the civic administration to cancel the contracts of these erring contractors. The mayor had also expressed his concerns over municipal commissioner Radhakrishna Game not implementing the rulings passed in the previous general body meeting.

Later, Game promised to take action against the erring contractors under central kitchen. Accordingly, the civic administration has taken action against the 13 contractors by cancelling their contracts from the new academic year.

AHMEDABAD: Gujarat had not recorded any positive COVID-19 case till Wednesday, but over the next two days it has reported seven cases, leapfrogging the figures of several Indian states. While 34 cases still await test results, 65 persons are already in quarantine. In all, 63 persons were quarantined after being ferried directly from international airports across Gujarat on Thursday and Friday alone. In the face of the exponential rise in cases and affected persons, the big question is if the state has enough quarantine and treatment facilities.

Gujarat health department officials said that 5,695 beds at 127 facilities have been created only for quarantine.

For the positive cases, as on Friday, the state has 572 beds and 204 ventilators in isolation wards at public hospitals and medical colleges. Moreover, 635 beds have been identified in 127 private hospitals in the state. In Ahmedabad, 100 beds have been set aside at GMERS College in Sola , 40 beds at the sub-district hospital in Singarva, 60 beds at Gujarat Institute of Disaster Management , and 50 beds at the Indian Institute of Public Health , Gandhinagar. Over the past fortnight, about 5,000 doctors and health professionals from government and private set-ups have been trained to identify and treat COVID-19.

Jayanti Ravi, the state’s principal secretary (health & family welfare), said on Friday that Gujarat has the capacity for 2,000 screenings for COVID-19 infections. “We have applied for four new labs. A in-principle nod has been received from the ICMR for labs in Bhavnagar and Surat,” she said. The state has two labs at present — in Ahmedabad and Jamnagar.

Prof Rajesh Chandwani, the chairperson of the Centre for Management of Health Services at IIM-Ahmedabad, said that fortunately India has not been hit by an epidemic like a few other countries have. “We are still to understand COVID-19 in Indian conditions,” he said. “But what we know from the experience abroad is that the majority of those who died had other health complications. Surely we need to assess the current infrastructure and prepare more quarantine facilities.”

It’s also important to leverage the student strength at medical colleges, said Prof Deepak Saxena, an infectious diseases expert at IIPH-Gandhinagar. “With more cases coming to light, contact tracing should be taken with the utmost seriousness to contain cases,” he said. “The government is trying its best and we should support it. Why can’t we engage departments such as community medicine at medical colleges for the task?”

T Malliga, a resident of Ramanathapuram district, stated that her husband Thangapandi, a fisherman, used to work for boats owned by others on daily wage. In 2005, Thangapandi and three others ventured inside the sea for fishing. Since they did not arrive at the shore the next day, the other fishermen went in search of them.

She stated that three fishermen who were rescued near Katchatheevu informed that their boat capsized and Thangapandi went missing. Since her husband could not be traced, she registered a missing complaint with the local police. As per Section 108 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872, a person missing for long and not heard of for over seven years could be presumed to have died.

She stated that the families of the fishermen who went missing during Okchi cyclone were given compensation by the state government. Though her husband went missing since 2005, she was not given death certificate nor any compensation from the government.Hence, the petitioner moved the high court Madurai bench seeking compensation from the government stating that she was in need of financial assistance to run her family.

Hearing the plea on Thursday, justice C V Karthikeyan sought a response from the state government. The judge also sought a report on such similar cases and adjourned the case.

According to sources, large swarms of mosquitoes can be seen around MLA Hostel due to an adjoining nullah. Fogging is being done there so that those in quarantine may not panic. This will also prevent mosquito breeding and help curb vector-borne diseases.NMC malaria and filarial officer Deepali Nasre told TOI, “City witnessed some spells of rain on March 10 and 15 following which there is change in atmospheric conditions. It has caused rise in number of mosquitoes. Corporators have demanded fogging citing misconceptions among people that Covid-19 spreads through mosquitoes. Though we clarified that Covid-19 is not a vector-borne disease, the drive has been launched to curb mosquito menace.”Nasre said water samples of a few areas have showed there are no Aedes aegypti mosquitoes, which cause dengue . “Despite this, we have started fogging, which is done one hour after sunrise and after sunset. One machine has been engaged especially for high court and adjacent areas after receiving complaints about a large number of mosquitoes there,” she said.Nasre said fogging will be stopped after rise in the temperatures, adding, “I appeal to all to use mosquito nets at home.”The officer also tried to allay fears about health problems due to fogging. “Fogging is being done as per guidelines of National Vector-borne Disease Control Programme. People have to take care only when fogging is done inside houses. In such situation, people should be out of home for one hour and enter only after opening windows and doors. There are no problems if fogging is done on streets using moving vehicles, as we are doing,” she said.Meanwhile, dengue cases have increased this year compared to the corresponding period of last year. The civic body has recorded 11 positive and 49 suspected cases between January 1 and March 14. Suspected cases always mean they are tested positive and treated for dengue in private hospitals. These cases are tested negative in NMC as it conducts the test using different methodology. Last year, there were 3 positive and 8 suspected cases between January 1 and March 31.Corporator Sunil Hiranwar in a press released alleged that NMC was not doing fogging in his ward despite repeated letters. “NMC officials say there is shortage of diesel. I request municipal commissioner Tukaram Mundhe to provide all facilities to health department as their job is very crucial,” he said.Also, the NMC has continued distribution of medicines as part of the nationwide drive to prevent filaria.",nagpur,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74742460,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-247833,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/fogging-starts-to-quell-covid-19-misconceptions-mosquitoes/articleshow/74738911.cms

AHMEDABAD: The Gujarat government on Friday told the Gujarat high court that the Government of India’s insistence on use of temperature guns, masks and sanitizers is not in accordance with any guidelines issued by the World Health Organization (WHO) so far as curbing Covid-19 is concerned.

The state health department said so in an affidavit filed in the HC in response to the reply sought by the court on what steps the state government has taken to curb the spread of novel coronavirus. It said, “Usage of temperature guns, sanitizers and masks is not must…The insistence of usage of temperature guns at each and every stage by the Government of India is not in accordance with any guidelines issued by WHO. Similarly, there is no need for usage of sanitizer, if one is frequent in hand washing.”

The government explained how a person with high-grade fever is not always a carrier of Covid-19. It further said, “Masks are required to be used by those who are likely to come in touch with suspected cases of coronavirus.” The government asserted that the Centre’s guidelines to use masks create a false sense of security. “Further, there is no scientific evidence to show any health benefits of using masks by non-sick persons in community,” the affidavit reads.

The state government has assured the HC that its authorities are equipped to deal with the coronavirus spread.

The government also filed an additional affidavit informing the HC about detection of three positive cases on late Thursday evening. One man in Rajkot returning from the Middle East was reported to have come in contact with 100 persons, the woman in Surat coming from London had come in contact with eight persons and the Ahmedabad’s woman had come in close contact with 18 persons upon her return from USA.

107,['21/03/2020'],Third director for mining dept in a month,"Thiruvananthapuram: The government has once again — for the third time in a span of one month — replaced the chief of sensitive mining and geology department that involves high stakes, to settle down for a non-IAS officer from the same department, citing “non-availability of IAS officers” to spare their services for the department.

In the latest decision, the government has removed V R Premkumar from the post on Friday, replacing him with C K Baiju , who is currently a deputy director in the department. Baiju had earlier held the post of director under the present LDF government for five months from November 2017, before K Biju took over as the director.

Senior IAS officer K Biju was removed from the post on February 17 but that had become a controversy. The government had replaced Biju with a junior IAS officer, Haritha V Kumar in the post. But the appointment lasted only for a few days, and she was replaced by V R Premkumar, another junior officer in the post. Premkumar, who had earned a good reputation for taking a firm stand in many of the land issues as a sub-collector in Devikulam, was appointed to the post on March 12, after being removed as director of survey and land records.

Former PWD secretary T O Sooraj is the only other IAS officer who had held the post of director of the department other than K Biju, Haritha V Kumar and V R Premkumar, in the list of 27 directors for the department since 1951. Sooraj had held the post during the previous LDF government’s tenure.

When Biju was removed from the post replacing him with Haritha V Kumar, TOI had reported that it was only a stop-gap arrangement before appointing a non-IAS officer with enough political backing in the post that holds high stakes in the quarrying industry.

It was learnt that the immediate reason for removing Biju from the post was that he had denied mining permit to a quarrying company citing that it fell within 10 km radius of vested forests because of which quarrying cannot be permitted. In the last six months alone, as many as 85 quarries were given stop memos on the basis of the recent order of the Centre that quarries functioning within 10-km radius of national parks and wildlife sanctuaries will have to take clearance from national board for wildlife.

The subsequent directors — also IAS officers — have now been removed in a span of couple of weeks. Sources added that the department has hardly appointed any IAS officer in the post of director of mining and geology in the past, as it is one of the posts with political interests and IAS officers are usually non-pliable in overlooking rules.

Interestingly, the removal of the present director V R Premkumar from the post in a span of eight days after appointing him has come at a time when the IAS officers had protested against his removal from the post of director of survey and land records within six months of his appointment.

PUNE: The Pune and Pimpri Chinchwad municipal corporations, KCB and government offices in the city have started reducing staff presence from Friday, except those from emergency services and those involved in the novel coronavirus prevention work.

The employees have been told to report on duty on alternate days or in batches to minimize staff presence, which the department heads said would not be more than 50%.

“Footfall at most offices has already reduced after restrictions were put on visits. Now, we have told staff members to report on duty on alternate days. There is no specific formula that is being adopted. The departments are deciding on reducing the number of employees as per requirements. We are also considering if the departments can reduce the numbers further,” an officer from the PMC said.

The civic administration has around 20,000 employees across various locations. Some departments have contractual workers as well. The officer said the municipal commissioner in a latest circular directed officers to sanction leave for those opting for it.

The staff from the health, solid waste management, fire, disaster, drainage and water supply departments have been told to report on duty as per requirements.

Manoj Laonkar, assistant commissioner of PCMC , said, “The heads of departments will take measures to reduce the attendance of employees and officers to 50%. They have to take a decision about calling the employees on a rotational basis. The employees who will not be in office on a particular day will have to complete their work on the day they are in office. We have also told them to approve leaves of the employees.” There are around 7,500 civic employees including teachers in PCMC.

In Khadki Cantonment Board (KCB), around 20 employees from the ‘Group C’ category who are mainly involved in clerical work, have been exempted from work. The KCB has around 40 employees.

Workers or employees of the engineering, health and hospital departments, will work as per the routine schedule, said KCB’s chief executive officer Pramodkumar Singh . “These employees will not report to work till April 1. We will take further decisions after assessing the situation,” he said.

An officer from the state government said employees had been told to report on duty on alternate days or after two days. This would lead to reduction in numbers, the officer said.

However, the decision by the Nepal government stalled our activities just 48 hours before the departure. It was sad to see the cancellation of one of the toughest mountaineering expeditions. Like every other dedicated mountaineer, we all had put in years of hard work and finances to summit this peak,” he said.While Zirpe realises that the Nepal government’s decision was inevitable and restricting travel is a good move to stop the spread of Covid-19, he is more worried about the sherpas living in the area, whose entire livelihood is dependent on the money they get from mountaineers.“March-April-May is when most people go trekking in the Himalayas . One team of climbers means income for at least 10 sherpa families. With Covid-19 hitting at the peak season, the entire economy will tank. The mountains will always be there to climb, but with no tourists visiting the place and with no alternative source of income, their survival is in jeopardy. Now they are planning to advertise autumn for trekking to make up for the lost spring season, but that is not a good move as it is very risky to climb at that time and the sherpas will be risking their lives to earn money then,” Zirpe added.K J Dawa Ongju , a sherpa from Nepal, said all of them are living on their savings. “There is not even a single team to climb which means 80% of our people are out of work. Due to coronavirus, we can’t go out and seek other work so we are living on our savings. Everybody here is waiting for the month to end to see if there is any change. If the travel ban remains, we will have no option but to go back to our villages and farm the small land parcels we have. But if the season doesn’t improve, survival is going to be tough,” he said.",pune,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74740772,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-183311,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/himalayan-expeditions-off-city-trekkers-worry-about-sherpas-survival-in-covid-19-season/articleshow/74739751.cms

Most in the city appreciated the approach and said they would observe the curfew and also ring bells, clap and make sounds with utensils around 5pm on Sunday as urged by the prime minister.Appreciating the initiative by PM Modi , most citizens want the complete lock down to be taken seriously. “As a responsible citizen, it is our moral responsibility to support this great initiative by our PM and make it 100 per cent successful. Since morning, I am requesting all my friends, staff, relatives and neighbours to follow this janata curfew. At 5pm, I will clap with my family from our balcony to support and appreciate our selfless heroes fighting this virus,” said advocate Sakshi Kshirsagar.Sharing his thoughts, Supantha Bhattacharya, professor at Hislop College, said a single day curfew would do no good, but long term solution is required. “I cannot but help wonder at the effectiveness of a voluntary curfew of a few hours on a single day. A compulsory lock down with stringent measures against defaulters and increased rate of testing would surely have been more appropriate in an undisciplined country like India. Haven’t made up my mind about the PDA (public display of appreciation) yet,” he said.Anand Chandrani, gay rights activist of the Sarathi Trust, is looking forward to the curfew day and wants to clap for the health workers who are selflessly working for patients and public. “We will be definitely clapping as urged by the PM because government has taken many preventive measures and the situation is under control. Some more stringent measures need to be taken. We will clap to appreciate and acknowledge the works of all those who are working for the betterment, while we are in the comfort of our homes.” he said.Adding to this Tejinder Singh Renu, secretary Vidarbha Taxpayers Association, said, “I am delighted at the way our government, administration and police are handling Covid-19 situation. Now they need citizens support by obeying suggestions to make their efforts successful. PM’s message should be followed by everyone. I along with family will surely be clapping at 5pm to express our gratitude to the staff. My salute to them,” he said.Tanveer Mirza expressed the need to donate, and help each other during tough times. “The government should appeal to the rich and capable section to be self motivated donors. Institutes must support the needy; everyone should do this as individual, social responsibility. Free ration for this period, relaxation and extension in bill payments will act like extra support. I am going to ring bells for these neglected sections and will clap for the people who are helping common Indians,” he said.Dr Moiz Mannan Haque, head of mass communication department, said, “The popularity of Modi will be of great help in motivating people to understand the importance of social distancing and implementing it. Let’s hope it works. The clapping etc is symbolic. The significance of the message shouldn’t be confined to one day.”Dr Jerryl Banait said this mass awakening initiative by PM Modi is a welcome step. “The whole nation will be standing in solidarity without gathering in one place. Clapping hands is a step to share positive energy across the nation for the health workers,” he said.",nagpur,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74742245,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-177666,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/citizens-raring-to-join-pm-modi-in-janata-curfew-clapping/articleshow/74738931.cms

Among those in self-quarantine are the youth’s mother and some relatives as well as another doctor and two nurses who had initially examined him.The government has formed eight teams to trace all those who had come in contact with the patient who travelled from Edinburgh and reached Bhubaneswar on Wednesday. A day later, he had tested positive for coronavirus , making him the second affected person in the state. Officials said from UK, the youth had first travelled to Amsterdam and from there on to Delhi. The state government has passed on the youth’s flight details to the Integrated Disease Surveillance Project (IDSP) in Delhi to trace his in-flight contacts.Government spokesperson Subroto Bagchi said the incident is being dealt with on a priority basis. “The government has information of 46 people coming in primary contact with him so far. So far, contacts have been made with 43 (for their home isolation and monitoring),” Bagchi said.Allaying apprehension that the incident could make AIIMS Bhubaneswar out of bounds for patients, institute’s director Gitanjali Batmanabane said, “The senior functionary and his family members besides all those who came in contact with the patient have been sent on home isolation. There is no cause of concern for others. The doctor and staff who treated the boy were all wearing N95 masks and had taken safety precautions as per the guidelines.”The AIIMS director also dismissed allegations that protocols were violated in the patient’s treatment. “His father brought him to the hospital to be tested the next day. He was taken to an isolation room and his test done. He continues to be in the isolation room. The patient is stable. He doing absolutely fine,” she said.Meanwhile, 66 samples have so far been collected in the state for testing. While two have tested positive, results of four are awaited.

115,['21/03/2020'],Seamen avert disaster by dousing fire at Quepem,"Quepem: Two seafarers put their firefighting skills to good use after an electricity transformer box in Quepem town caught fire on Friday afternoon and personnel of the fire and emergency services in Curchorem could not reach the spot in time.

The incident also brought into focus the lack of a dedicated fire brigade for the town despite it hosting the administrative headquarters of the Quepem taluka and having a disaster management cell of its own.

The situation on Friday went out of control after the transformer box, which is made of fibre-reinforced plastic, caught fire, throwing up plumes of smoke.

The transformer is located barely 1.5m away from residential bungalows and a commercial building.

While linemen rushed to the site, two seafarers, Jeff Goes and his colleague, tried to extinguish the fire with dry chemical powder extinguishers. It took the duo around 20 minutes to contain the situation with six extinguishers that they had borrowed from nearby shops.

Personnel of the Curchorem fire station reached Quepem 20 minutes after the incident occurred.

The head fireman Umesh M Chari attributed the delay to congestion caused by mining trucks on the Curchorem-Quepem road.

Power supply to the area was restored in the evening after the distribution box was replaced.

116,['21/03/2020'],Nirbhaya convict Vinay Sharma’s tryst with paintings,"Thiruvananthapuram: Was Vinay Sharma , one of the four convicted in Nirbhaya gangrape and murder who were hanged to death on Friday, an artist? As per Tihar Jail authorities , Sharma wanted to donate his paintings, which he had drawn while in jail, suggesting that he was a painter, and many would have wondered how an artistic mind could commit such a horrendous crime.

His paintings, in fact, were a result of a painting camp organized by Lalit Kala Akademi, the National Academy of Art, in collaboration with Tihar Jail as part of the National Tihar Art Festival ‘Kalabhiyan’ from August 19 to 23 in 2017. The camp was intended as an art therapy for frustrated and depressed inmates of the prison.

Sharma did not have a history of any artistic indulgence, but took to painting to portray himself as a victim, a central character unjustifiably tormented by society, said noted artist Murali Cheeroth , who was among the 15 artists from various states who led the painting camp. “But, for sure, he wasn’t honest and it was evident in the conflicting tales he told different artists, including me. He didn’t have any commendable artistic skills, but his composition and choice of colours were not bad either,” recalled Cheeroth, a native of Thrissur and now based in Bangalore.

But that was two-and-a-half years ago. And Murali doesn’t know to what extent Sharma was able to excel in painting after he was introduced to art at the camp. “He produced around six works, mostly acrylic on canvas and the rest in oil, during the camp. The initial ones were all very negative, clearly suggesting how frustrated he was. The first work featured Hanuman, the epic character in Ramayana, trapped in an island, an army of monkeys chasing him away, carrying flags in which he wrote in Hindi all the nasty abuses the world outside was showering upon him,” Murali said.

Murali then asked him why he could not produce some pleasant or positive works as he could leave them for posterity. “I told him that his works, whether a painting or a book, would remain forever even after he is gone, which I think had some effect on him. The last couple of works he did were different,” he said.

A confusing character, with a complicated mental state and always craving for others’ sympathy, this man didn’t seem remorseful at all — for his horrific deeds — to the artists who had the freedom to interact with the inmates for a week.

“Sharma, unlike many others who were so frustrated for ending up in jail for a long term and who showed resistance towards the art camp or any art therapy initially, was seen as very active from the very beginning. A trainer at a gym earlier, he showed me how he filled empty water bottles with sand as improvised dumbbells,” Murali recalled.

According to jail authorities, Sharma’s final wish was to give his paintings to the jail superintendent and one work ‘Hanuman Chalisa’ to his family.

Two seats held by the BJP also fell vacant - one due to death of Manohar Untwal and another after the Speaker accepted MLA Sharad Kol’s resignation. The party is contesting Kol’s resignation saying that he had given that resignation some months ago and had, later, withdrawn it.When asked whether there have been so many simultaneous by-elections in the state before, political observer, Girijashankar, said “No, it’s unprecedented and I have a feeling that it may be converted into a mid-term election by the next government. Who would like to have a vulnerable government. Even if the BJP is able to win 15 out of 25 seats, they won’t have a comfortable majority. It won’t be strange if the BJP leadership decides to recommend dissolution of the House to pave way for a fresh election. In fact, Kamal Nath should have done it the day after 17 of his MLAs went to Bengaluru,” he said.The 25 seats in question have a “mixed” history as far as results are concerned, but since the BJP had landslide victory in Madhya Pradesh over the past three elections before 2018 assembly election, when Congress came back to power, it seems to have upper edge over the rival Congress in these constituencies as everywhere else in the state.Congress, which has 23 of the 25 seats slated to go for by-polls as of now, had won only six of these seats in 2013 election and nine in 2008 election.

Such vehicles bearing odd registration numbers will ply on odd days and vehicles with even registration number will be allowed to ply on even days. There is no bar on the personal vehicles used by the government officials. The regulation is strictly meant for public transport vehicles with the exception of the ones used for hospitals,” a BMC official said.The regulation will see many Mo buses off the roads on those days resulting in less commuting and thinner traffic. Other private buses (other than the ones run by the Capital Region Urban Transport or CRUT) will also remain off the road on the basis of the odd-even formula.After coming up with an SOP for the markets and curtailing the timings of 17 big grocery, vegetable, fish and meat markets, the BMC on Friday listed out the types of shops that will remain closed to ensure social distancing.Jewellery stores, automobile and cycle shops, shops selling electronics appliances, sports items, furniture, shoes, marbles, tiles, watches, paints, books and magazines and gift items will remain closed until further order. The grocery, vegetable, meat, chicken and egg shops shall remain open, the BMC order said. It was issued after the general administration department of the state government came up with stricter provisions to ensure social distancing.The respective zonal deputy commissioners of the BMC will ensure that shops other than the vegetable, grocery and meat fish shops are closed. But they will have to follow the SOP of social distancing and sanitization.On Friday, the BMC restricted the entry of common people into its office to ensure that they don’t come in contact with the officials and employees engaged in emergency duties in view of Coronavirus.",bhubaneswar,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74741759,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-112990,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhubaneswar/bmc-to-start-odd-even-for-public-vehicles/articleshow/74738167.cms

143,['21/03/2020'],Embassy despatches food supplies to fishermen stranded in Iran,"Kanyakumari: Hundreds of Indian fishermen stranded in Iran have got a temporary relief as the Indian embassy in Iran has sent food supplies to them.

Fishermen said some boats ran short of food supplies many days ago, and the men managed by sharing the leftover supplies in other boats. The fishermen said they had reduced their food intake to prolong the availability of the stock.

An official communication for providing supplies that was with the fishermen stated that 976 Indian fishermen were stranded at Kish Island , Lavan Island , Bustaneh, Charak, Chiruyeh, Moqam and Asalouyeh ports. It stated that Rs 30,13,731 has been quoted by the supplier for the materials for two weeks. The materials were taken to the fishermen in mini goods carriers.

“The supplies we got included rice, onion, tomato, potato, green chili, ginger, water, oil, tea, eggs sugar and chicken. This will fulfil our urgent needs and will suffice for four days,” said Sahaya Ascar , 27, a fisherman in Chiruyeh said and added that their fear is on the rise with every passing day as Covid-19 is fast spreading in Iran.

Fisherman Jesu Rethnam, 39, who coordinated the distribution of relief materials at Kish Island, thanked the governments of India and Tamil Nadu for the food materials. However, the fishermen expressed disappointment over embassy officials not reaching out to them.

“We expected officials to come with the materials and wanted to air our grievances to them. But only Iranian drivers came with the food items. We had linguistic barrier but asked them to inform the officials that we are in fear of getting infected and asked for their help to return to India,” Rethnam said.

Meanwhile, in Kanyakumari district , kin of fishermen stranded in Iran tied black flags at the coastal villages, houses and churches to urge the government to bring their men back home immediately.

NAGPUR: The trustees of Poddareshwar Ram Mandir on Central Avenue have given up their earlier stand of organizing the Ramnavami shobha yatra on April 2. The procession hasn’t been cancelled but trustees will wait for orders from the authorities concerned before fixing a further date. They expect to receive a communication in this regard on March 26.

The coronavirus outbreak has already led to cancellation of various religious gatherings, including the Ramnavami celebrations at Ayodhya. Considering this and in light of the section 144 imposed in the city, Poddareshwar Mandir trustee Puneet Poddar said they will wait for approval from commissioner of police. “We will cooperate with the government and won’t act against the law. Even if we have to wait for over two months, we will wait,” he said.

According to the trustees, a lot of time and money is invested for organizing such a huge procession, hence cancelling it abruptly won’t be a justice to the many workers and participants who have worked day and night to prepare floats for the shobha yatra.

On March 15, the trustees had decided not to call off the shobha yatra. Instead, they planned various precautionary measures such as distribution of sanitizers etc to devotees, but after so many positive cases coming up in the city followed by section 144 coming in power made them change their minds for good.

“All contracts have been given and materials are booked. The shobha yatra will not be cancelled as it will lead to huge losses for the daily wage workers. We are waiting for government orders after which the date will be decided soon,” said Poddar.

The organizers of shobha yatra by Ram Mandir at Ram Nagar have already cancelled the procession. But they are disappointed after a recent action of the police.

“On Friday, cops asked the priest to close the temple immediately at around 5pm. There were a few people inside the temple who had come for the evening aarti. We are always cooperating with the government. But we do not appreciate this gesture of police. Now we have decided to keep the main doors closed. A small gate will be open though,” said Ravi Waghmare , president of Paschim Nagpur Nagarik Mandal .

Waghmare further said that they will keep the Ram Mandir and Hanuman Mandir closed on Saturday and Sunday. He also said that the government, police or NMC should send circulars to all temples regarding directives for Gudi Padwa which falls on March 25 and Ramnavami on April 2.

Each laboratory has about six trained personnel for sample collection, specimen processing and RT-PCR (real time polymerase chain reaction tests) testing.Each laboratory sends the first 10 samples it collects to the National Institute of Virology in Pune for cross-verification of test results. The results of the other samples are declared by the laboratories in about seven hours. However, logistics involved in the transportation of samples has been consuming a lot of time.For example, for a suspected case in Ichchapuram, the sample has to be sent to the special laboratory in Kakinada, which is around 400 km away and is handling samples from five districts.A state health official said they have a sufficient number of RT-PCR (real time polymerase chain reaction tests) kits at these centres that can help determine the presence of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19. “Two more special labs are likely to come up in Anantapur and Visakhapatnam to improve the pace of delivery of results,” said the official.Dr R Ramana Rao, a general physician, said, “As of now, the state government should consider setting up a special lab in every district as the pandemic is fast spreading in the country. This will come as a great relief for the suspected patients who wait for the results.”“Moreover, a high-end virology laboratory in the state is the need of the hour with the evolution of new strains and mutations of microbes.

Madurai has about 40 to 50 old age homes across the city and only about half of them are registered. Most of these homes have not less than 25 inmates and receive food from donors on a daily basis at least twice.

The corporation has about six homes in which homeless people stay, most of them above the age of 60. District collector Dr T G Vinay told TOI that all precautions had been taken in regard to the oldage homes. Personnel from the department of social welfare and health had visited the homes and inspected their hygiene and sanitation. Now they have been told to restrict the entry of outsiders. ``If at all they insisted on coming, they had to exercise thorough hand hygiene, wash their feet, face and exposed parts of the body before coming in,’’ he said.

P Ramar, the manager of the corporation home at Sellur, said they had decided to ask donors to give them the provisions for the meals, and that they would cook the food for them as a precautionary measure. Inmates are also being told to wash their hands regularly and maintain safe distance. ``We are also not taking new admissions, and insist that they sit apart from each other,’’ he said. Manager of a home at Karupayoorani , Rose, said insisting that old women wash their hands regularly as informed by the officials will be difficult as most of them fear they would catch a cold if they stood near the taps for long. ``Some of them were getting offended when we asked them not to sit too close together and talk,’’ she said.

150,['21/03/2020'],12 policemen suspended in Jalna for framing man,"Representative image

AURANGABAD: Special inspector general of police, Aurangabad range, Ravinder Kumar Singal on Friday ordered the suspension of 12 policemen , including two inspectors, for trying to frame a man in a false case of preparing for dacoity.

Yashwant Jadhav, who headed the anti-dacoity squad of Jalna police, which has now been dismantled, and inspector Devidas Shelke of Kadim Jalna police station were among the suspected policemen.

When contacted, Singal confirmed of ‘initiating action as per law’ and passing orders of suspending the policemen. Citing the pledge that policemen take while joining the service, Singal said, “Men in khaki pledge to protect the good and destroy the evil. We are duty bound to check on them if any of them turn to be oppressors and rampantly destroy lives and careers of innocents by framing them in false cases.”

The decision has been taken after probationary IPS officer Gorakh Bhamre submitted a detailed report of the preliminary inquiry carried out by a team led by him earlier this week. Sources privy to the inquiry said that it had been established that the suspended policemen had food and drinks with the man, Anil Walekar, at a dhaba before picking him up from Kadim Jalna.

The team led by Bhamre found out at the time of being held, Walekar was having food with Subhash Vaidya—the key accused in Nitin Katariya murder case that was committed in broad daylight on September 19, 2017 in Jalna.

Despite being Vaidya’s friend, Walekar was one of the key witnesses in the murder case registered against the former. On inquiring, it was found one of the policeman, who had reached the dhaba to apprehend Walekar was an acquaintance of Vaidya. The policemen who have been suspended systematically released Vaidya and later framed Walekar.

Walekar had alleged that after he was framed in a false case registered with Kadim Jalna police on January 4. Subsequently, he was taken into custody by Vaijapur police of Aurangabad rural, Newasa police of Ahmednagar district and Osmanabad district police for questioning in the pending cases of house break-in and theft registered in their respective jurisdictions.

As per Walekar’s complaint, although he was picked up from a dhaba in Jalna along with his friend, the anti-dacoity squad concocted a story that he was part of a gang of suspected dacoits, who were caught when they were preparing to commit a dacoity after a brief chase.

Walekar, along with other suspects, was kept in custody for 42 days from January 3 to February 14. When he was released on bail, Walekar collected the CCTV footage of the dhaba from where he was picked up by the anti-dacoity squad and submitted it to the IGP.

Police authorities suspect that Walekar might have been framed in the case for allegedly pressurising him to turn hostile in the murder case.

Deepak’s family has denied the allegation and said that Deepak died late on Thursday night and fire mishap took place due to short circuit in the air-conditioner hours after his death.

“Deepak had a dispute with his family members after he demanded his share of property when he required money for his treatment. Even his brothers threatened that they would kill him, my sister and their 10-year-old son. We lodged a case in Burla police station in this regard on March 8. Later, when Deepak’s health condition deteriorated, he was admitted to the nursing home in Burla,” said Deepak’s brother-in-law, Sanjaya Agrawal of Bhatli in Bargarh district.

Sanjaya, who lodged a complaint with Burla police, said his sister was with Deepak in the nursing home till 11 pm on Thursday. Deepak’s family asked her to go home and told her that they would attend to Deepak. “Around around 5.30 am on Friday, they informed my sister that Deepak was dead. We also came to Burla from Bhatli after we came to know about the incident. However, when we arrived at the nursing home, Deepak’s family members besides staff of the nursing home did not allow us to enter the cabin, where Deepak’s body had been kept,” he said.

Sanjaya went on to say that he was told the door of the cabin will be opened after the doctor arrives. “Subsequently, we came out of the nursing home. But after some time when we again went inside the nursing home, we saw Deepak’s family members taking out the body. We also saw that the body had burn injuries. We went inside the cabin, where Deepak was admitted, and found the bed besides other things inside burnt. It is a planned murder. Deepak’s family members killed him in the nursing home,” he added.

Inspector-in-charge of Burla police station B B Bhoi said a case has been registered on the basis of the complaint. “The scientific team has inspected the nursing home. The autopsy of the body was conducted,” he said.

Mohan Balasaheb Wayal (30), a farmer from Pangri (Bk) in Mantha taluka of Jalna district , had moved high court in 2019 seeking directions for police to register a crime against the officials of the village Panchayat Pangri (Bk) along with others who were expected to supervise the project, check measurement books and then sanction the bills.

As many as 13 people, including revenue and police officials, were made respondents. The petitioner contended that the National Drinking Water Scheme was to be implemented through the village panchayat in the year 2016.

For this project, the petitioner gifted 2 guntha land for digging the well. However, the officials concerned prepared a false record to show that the well has been dug and misappropriated Rs 70 lakh.

During earlier hearings, the court had sought details into the case following which the tehsildar concerned submitted a report. The court, however, was not inclined to believe the report and directed the police to make preliminary enquiry to ascertain as to whether there is truth in the allegations.

Mantha police inspector accordingly inquired into the matter and submitted the report to the court. The court observed: “Even before implementation of the aforesaid scheme, three wells were in existence on the land. No new well was dug much less, in the portion which was gifted by the petitioner. A show was created that this was the new well and even pipeline was laid to show that supply of drinking water was actually made to the villagers.’’

While allowing the petition on March 5, the high court held that “there is substance in the allegations made by the petitioner and thorough investigation is necessary and for that registration of crime is necessary.”

In reply, Nath said he is “not a person who abandons ship”. “The chief minister said he will be with the party and not desert the MLAs. When some of them got emotional, he said in six months Congress will be back in power in Madhya Pradesh,” the spokesman said.

Several restaurants and textile shops have temporarily shut down over the last couple of days. A slump in business and shortage of staff have forced many traders to stop operations.B Vijayakumar, district secretary of Kerala Hotel and Restaurants Association (KHRA), said around 30% of eateries have stopped functioning since Covid-19 hit the state. “Staff, mostly migrant labourers, are going back to their home state, fearing the spread of the virus. Loss of business is another major reason. It is difficult to run restaurants due to huge loss,” he said.Vijayakumar said online delivery has almost stopped.“Those who keep their restaurants open have decided to ensure safety by requesting customers to wash hands before having food. Posters are displayed near the wash area about good hand-washing practices. We have also decided to keep all hotels shut on Sunday as per the Prime Minister’s directive for janata curfew,” he said.Another restaurant owner said he was planning to close the restaurant on Saturday and Sunday expecting poor turnout in offices in the city.Peringamala Ramachandran, district president of Kerala Vyapari Vyavasayi Ekopana Samithi, said the state government must do away with flood cess to support traders at this time of crisis. “The flood cess was introduced to collect around Rs 1,200 crore. It was collected in the first year itself,” he said.He added that exemption in payment of electricity bill should be extended to a minimum of three months. “The government must announce some relief measures for traders,” he said.Ramachandran said the government should pump money into the market because traders are left without any money. “With the neighbouring states closing the border, we fear the scarcity of necessary items. The situation is turning scary,” he said.Management of Sangeeth Silks, a textile shop at Statue, said they are temporarily shut for the safety of the staff who use public transport to reach the shop. “Business was also dull. The decision to re-open will be taken only after a week,” the manager said.Traders expressed concern over further lockdown over Covid-19.

The students who reached the airport on March 17 came to know that their tickets were cancelled just before they were to board their flight on March 18.

They stayed in the Manila airport till March 20 before being forced to leave. The students from Lyceum Northwestern University in Dagupan , AMA College in Makatie, University of Perpetual in Las Pinas and PLT College in Bayombong, include 25 from Tamil Nadu . The others hail from Andhra Pradesh , Kerala, Telangana , Gujarat and Rajasthan.

“Following a spurt in Covid-19 cases Philippines was given level 3 alert, and the government announced closure of all the cities on March 16. Educational institutions and work places were closed for 35 days. We were given an option to stay in the hostels but were warned that there could be difficulty in serving food if the shops are closed,” said R Godwin Leo, 19, from Vattam in Kanyakumari district.

Godwin, who is studying in the Lyceum Northwestern University said that he and other students booked their flight tickets on March 17. “It is an eight-hour journey by road to cover the 400km distance to the Manila airport. Twenty-five students from my college reached the airport in the evening in a hired van. We completed the immigration formalities and were collecting the boarding passes when trouble began,” he said.

Moments before they could board the flight they were informed by the Air Asia staff that their tickets have been cancelled and that India will not be permitting flights from the Philippines and many other countries. The students said they stayed in the airport with the hope of getting help from the Indian embassy to fly home. They said the embassy officials reached them on March 18 and assured to repatriate them.

“But the officials did not respond to our calls or messages. We started making videos and sharing them on social media to get the government’s attention. But on 19th, embassy officials asked us to leave the airport and return to our colleges,” he said and added that the students, however, stayed in the airport with some hope to fly to India.

“We spent three days in the airport without proper food. At last around 11.15 on Friday morning the embassy officials with the help of the airport police forced us to leave the airport. They said there are no flights to India till March 31,” said Aarthy Satheesh Kumar of Chennai. Left with no other option, the students started back to their hostels.

On reaching their hostels they were allowed to stay during the closure period. But the hostels told them that they would not be served breakfast throughout this period.

The students have appealed to the governments of India and Philippines to repatriate them as they fear getting infected by the virus as it is fast spreading there.

157,['21/03/2020'],Masjids adopt Covid-19 measures with Friday prayer,"NAGPUR: Masjids across the city curtailed the Friday prayer ‘Jumma’ and Khudba (sermon) duration from 45 minutes to just 10-15 besides shutting waduhkhana (abulation taps), removing carpets and towels in their bid to prevent the spread of the novel coronavirus (Covid-19).Though many turned up in large numbers for the Jumma, many reached masjids only at the start of prayers and left soon after. As per Islamic tenets, offering prayers five times a day is must for Muslims with mouzen giving calls (Azaan) as many times in the day. While rest of the prayers can be offered at home or as per convenience, Jumma congregation is a must mainly because of sermon and weekly advisory (bayaan) which takes over 45 minutes.At some places, volunteers requested the Namaazis to maintain social distancing guidelines and not to crowd the premises.Several imams included the WHO and government guidelines on hygiene and precautions to be taken to control community outbreak. They also appealed to elderly members aged above 60 and those suffering from cold, cough or fever to pray at home.Lawyer Mohammad Fazal , who offered Jumma at Ahbab Colony in Anant Nagar, said human life is paramount in Islam. “Coming to masjid is important but community health is equally important,” he said.He said Muslims are being convinced to strictly follow the guidelines on the basis of Islamic teachings. “One of the charactersitc of Islam is good hygiene. The sermon also on supporting the government regarding Covid-19 virus. Imam sahib covered the important aspect of stopping rumours. One of the Prophet Mohammad (PBUH) hadith (teaching) is to verify any information coming to you before forwarding it,” he said.Fazal said the Ahbab Masjid and others in the city have removed carpets while prayers are offered directly on the floor. “After every prayer, the floor is being sanitized,” he said, adding that people have been advised to use handkerchief for prostrating.Mominpura-based Hafiz Sohel Athar said Muslims were already cooperating the government and administration in keeping hotels and shops closed. “ The khudba and bayaan were cut short and it took just 15 minutes to complete the Jumma prayers,” he said.He said the Waduhkhanas were shut but open only for emergencies and for travellers.“To maintain hygiene, skull caps, carpets and towels have been removed in masjids in our area. Toilets and bathrooms are being regular cleaned,” he said.Athar said he observed that as the coronavirus has instilled fear among people, more are coming for prayers. “People are coming in large numbers seeking forgiveness from Eshwar (God) and protection from the disease,” he said.A cleric from Jaffar Nagar said several police stations had asked them to avoid congregation and they agreed to it. “Everyone agreed that it is for our own safety,” he said.",nagpur,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74742215,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-212603,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/masjids-adopt-covid-19-measures-with-friday-prayer/articleshow/74739028.cms

The teacher’s family alleged that he was subjected to torture by his in-laws and later by police after which he committed suicide. A magisterial probe has been ordered into the incident.

Anil Kumar alias Parvat Singh of Gidausa village in Jalaun district, an assistant teacher at a government school in Sempur village in Auraiya, visited his in-laws place in Sukhapurwa village of Kannauj and allegedly created ruckus following a tiff with his wife, Neeraj.

Police said Neeraj had been living with her parents since February 21 following a dispute with Anil. On the complaint of Neeraj’s family, Anil was detained by cops on Thursday night. Cops, however, went into a tizzy after they found Anil hanging in the toilet of the police station early on Friday morning.

They alerted senior authorities after which Anil was rushed to Tirwa medical college where doctors pronounced him dead.

Anil’s family members created ruckus at the medical college. Accusing Anil’s im-laws and police of harassment, they blocked Thatia-Medical College road. DM Rakesh Kumar Mishra, superintendent of police Amrendra Singh and other senior officers reached the spot to take stock of the situation.

But now, he is not sure what is in store for him in the coming days. “They say orders are not coming and production will go down in the coming days. I may not be sacked but would be asked to go on leave if orders don’t come,’’ he says.Scores of migrant workers like Lallan cannot leave the units and search for new jobs and have to endure days of unpaid leave.Textile manufacturers are in an equally tricky situation. On one side, the units are staring at a drop in production as orders are drying up. Hence, retaining the entire workforce would be infeasible. On the other side, they could not afford to lay off the workforce since getting them back once things get back to normalcy would be difficult.“We can’t send them home as train services have been suspended. We can’t keep them idle also,” says Raja M Shanmugam, president of the Tirupur Exporters Association. “When they return once the business picks up, there is a threat of infection due to the travel.”The garment sector in Tirupur employs about 4.5 lakh workers out of which roughly 30% are migrant workers, according to trade unions. These workers are mostly from Bihar, Jharkhand, West Bengal and Odisha.For now, the textile units have decided to offer fewer shifts that will help the workers sustain themselves as well as ensure that the units don’t have to go headhunting later. “The units will ensure that the workers get paid enough to meet their essential requirements,” Shanmugam says.N Ramaswamy, centre manager of the Odisha Migration Support Centre functioning for the welfare of migrant workers from Odisha, says there has not been an exodus of the workforce. “I don’t think they will be sent back since migrant workers form a crucial part of the garment sector here. But we don’t know what will happen in the coming days.”Trade unions, however, are apprehensive. G Sampath, general secretary of the Banian and General Workers Union , says two small scale units that employ 100 workers have declared leave. “Only in the last two days, we have realised the severity of the Covid-19 impact. It may take a few more days for the effect to show up on the textile sector.

164,['21/03/2020'],Third front possibility emerges in Bihar ahead of assembly election,"Jitan Ram Manjhi

PATNA: HAM(S) president and former CM Jitan Ram Manjhi on Wednesday hinted at the formation of a third front in Bihar to contest the upcoming assembly election due in the state later this year.

Though his meeting with chief minister Nitish Kumar on Tuesday fuelled speculations about fresh political alignments, Manjhi denied going back to the JD(U) fold and said he would explore the possibility of forming a “brihad mahagathbandhan” with Upendra Kushwaha’s RLSP, VIP led by Mukesh Sahani, JAP(L) led by former RJD MP Pappu Yadav, Mayawati’s BSP, AIMIM and more importantly CPI’s Kanhaiya Kumar, whom he described as a leader who works in the interest of the downtrodden in Bihar.

Manjhi’s statement assumes significance in the backdrop of his meeting with poll strategist and former JD(U) national vice-president Prashant Kishor, along with Kushwaha and Sahani in Delhi recently. Prashant is searching for a new face and also exploring options to settle political scores with Nitish, who expelled him after his frontal attack on JD(U) for its stand on CAA, NPR and NRC.

There is a strong possibility of a ‘third front’ in Bihar in the backdrop of RJD’s approach to its allies, particularly Manjhi and Congress. Party insiders say RJD does not take any notice of Manjhi’s statements citing his party’s poor performance in the Lok Sabha and assembly elections, which proved little clout Manjhi has among Dalits and Mahadalits.

Though a section of Congress is unhappy over denial of a Rajya Sabha seat, sources said the party is too weak at the grassroots level to part ways with RJD, unless it is made to “suffer a bigger humiliation” in the days ahead. “But Kanhaiya’s face can force the central leadership to think over it,” a Congress senior said.

RJD sources said the party will not contest less than 150 seats in the 243-member assembly. Tejashwi took a personal dig at Manjhi on Wednesday saying it was his party, which made his son Santosh an MLC.

Though Kushwaha told TOI on Wednesday that he was with the mahagahtbandhan and will remain there to defeat NDA, RLSP sources said the party was weighing options and may go with Manjhi if it does not get a respectable number of seats.

CPI state secretary Satya Narain Singh told TOI that his party favours the formation of a “democratic secular front” with CPI-M, Pappu, Dadan Pehelwan, RLSP, VIP and Congress, provided it makes its stand clear.

“We had talks with Manjhi, Kushwaha and Pappu but things are still to take shape. We will also discuss the poll possibility at our two-day executive and council meeting to be held from March 24,” Singh said, adding, Kanhaiya also wanted a non-BJP, non-RJD front in the state. However, Singh is not sure about CPI(ML) joining them for their obvious inclination towards RJD, which had left the Ara seat for the party to contest in the last Lok Sabha polls.

“There is need for a big alternative given the present political situation as democracy is in danger. CPI is welcome as it talks about Bihari interest. We will discuss the political scenario in our national executive committee meeting on Thursday,” Pappu said.

Qamrul Hoda, who opened the AIMIM account in Bihar assembly by winning the byelection from Kishanganj recently, said his party was not averse to a bigger alliance. “Our party leadership will decide as we are preparing on all 243 assembly seats. In fact, we had invited Manjhi to our Kishanganj rally to which he agreed, but backed out later. We will focus on Seemanchal, but joining any alliance will depend upon the partners’ clear stand on certain issues,” he said over phone.

Police have recovered gold chains weighing nine sovereigns from them. Three other members of the gang had landed in police net last week.

Police identified the accused as K Jothi , of Arasankadu on Mangalam Road, and her husband R Karthik, both aged 34. An investigation officer said the couple had rented a house near Palladam, where they were staying with the other three women accomplices. “They took to snatching gold chains to lead a lavish life.”

Preliminary inquiry revealed that Jothi and Karthik were born in Sri Lanka. “They, however, came to Chennai more than 30 years ago. They have passports and fly to Sri Lanka often. They usually target women devotees during temple festivals,” the officer said.

The officer said the gang was busted based on complaints lodged by 48-year-old M Umamaheswari, of Sundarapuram; S Komalavalli, 74, of VPV Nagar at Cheran Colony near Thudiyalur; and 52-year-old M Shantha , of Rathinapuri .

While Umamaheswari and Komalavalli lost their gold chain to the snatchers at Koniamman temple on Big Bazaar Street, Shantha lost her chain at Ukkadam bus stand. “In all the three cases, the chain snatchers had pushed down the victims to deviate their attention,” the officer said.

Based on the complaints, a team led by special sub inspector Marimuthu collected CCTV footages from Koniamman temple and arrested Jothi and Karthik on Thursday.

However, transport of essential commodities to Kerala from the state will be allowed. It is to be noted that Kerala has so far tested 40 positive cases of Covid-19.

The move follows an order from the state government to close all the check posts on TN-Kerala, TN-Karnataka and TN-Andhra Pradesh borders.

Vehicles carrying essential commodities like milk, vegetables, liquified petroleum gas cylinders, petrol, diesel, medicines and other goods will, however, be allowed to enter the neighbouring states.

Coimbatore houses 14 inter-state border check posts at Mulli, Kopanari, Mangarai, Anaikatti, Walayar, Velanthavalam, Veerappagoundanur, Gopalapuram, Nadupuni, Vadakkukadu, Zaminkaliyapuram, Meenakshipuram, Semmanampathy and Mazhukkuparai. These are manned by the district rural police.

District collector K Rajamani said buses plying between Coimbatore and various parts of Kerala won’t be operated from Saturday morning to March 31. Likewise, buses from Kerala won’t be allowed to enter the district. In addition to police teams, revenue and transport department officials would also be deployed at the check posts round the clock.

“Vehicles with essential commodities will be allowed to cross the border check posts and return. People travelling in those vehicles will be screened thoroughly by the health department teams,” Rajamani said.

Earlier, the district administration had announced the plans to close nine border check posts from Friday 6pm. However, the decision was called off after authorities held talks with the Kerala state government.

Extending support to Sunday’s ‘janata curfew’, Coimbatore District Petroleum Dealers’ Association said they would close all the petrol bunks in the district from 7am to 9pm on March 22. “A few staff will be working that day, but fuel will be provided only to ambulances for emergency purposes,” said K Govindarajulu, president of the association.

While the Coimbatore District Hoteliers’ Association has decided to declare holiday for all the hotels, All India Tourists Vehicle Owners’ Welfare Association said they won’t operate vehicles on Sunday.

170,['21/03/2020'],"Visit hospital only if it is urgent, say doctors","Madurai: Doctors of both government and private sectors have urged patients and their attenders to avoid visiting hospitals in the light of the Covid-19 scare unless it is an emergency.

“Decreasing large gatherings should include hospitals as well. Patients’ relatives, especially with holidays announced for schools, should not make use of it to bring their children to hospitals. Even outpatients can postpone their regular check-ups and only go in case of emergency,” said a senior doctor at Government Rajaji Hospital (GRH). GRH is one of the largest government hospitals in Tamil Nadu frequented by thousands of patients every day. The doctor added that even patients going for elective surgeries can wait for some time if possible.

One of the city’s biggest hospitals specialising in eye care, Aravind Eye Hospitals (AEH), has announced that it will provide eye care consultation and treatment to patients who have emergency problems like sudden loss of vision, severe pain or redness in the eye, injury to the eye and ulcers. Patients who have undergone an operation recently and need mandatory follow-up will also be seen. In a statement on Friday, the AEH management asked all patients who need routine follow-up or check-up to come to the hospital only after March 31.

“Those with chronic illnesses that require periodical visits like cancer or kidney disease can postpone their next visit to the hospital or try to contact the doctor over phone. Many of the elderly with diabetes and hypertension can also afford to postpone their regular hospital check-ups because they are vulnerable. Only in case of emergency should they come to a hospital,” said a general physician at a private multi-speciality hospital.

While private hospitals have limited attenders, they still see footfall in thousands. Hospitals are a hotbed of infection and even measures like use of hand sanitisers or hand washing may not be enough, added the doctors.

Bhopal: After two weeks of electrifying political drama, Kamal Nath handed in his resignation as chief minister on Monday, saying betrayal by “Maharaj” and “political greed” has defeated the hopes and belief of Madhya Pradesh.

Referring to the twists and turns of the past fortnight, Nath’s parting message was: “We need to remember that after today, tomorrow comes. People will give a befitting reply.”

Hitting out for the first time at Jyotiraditya Scindia, whose shock defection led to the collapse of the Congress government, Nath said: “One Maharaja and his 22 accomplices, together with BJP, murdered democratic values. People will never forgive these greedy persons who betrayed the state.”

Around 1:15pm, with the clock ticking on Supreme-Court ordered floor test, the CM’s convoy rolled into Raj Bhavan, where Nath handed his resignation. “In my 40 years of public life, I have always practised politics of cleanliness and given priority to democratic values. Whatever happened in the past two weeks in Madhya Pradesh, is a new chapter in the devaluation of democratic tenets... I extend my good wishes to the new chief minister. He will always get my support for the development of Madhya Pradesh,” said his letter.

A few minutes after the resignation, Nath tweeted, “Today, the hopes and beliefs of Madhya Pradesh have been defeated. The gluttonous and avaricious have won. No one can win by crushing the self-respect of Madhya Pradesh. I will continue to work for the state with all my determination.”

The Congress government that came to power after defeating the 15-year-old BJP government lasted 15 months. “BJP got 15 years. I got 15 months, 2.5 months of which went in the model code of conduct,” Nath pointed out at a press meet before he headed for Raj Bhavan. In this short period, his government fulfilled 400 promises made in the Vachan Patra, he said.

On Friday, health officials duly checked more than 180 passengers who arrived from Dubai and even rubber-stamped the hands of those at low risk for the disease with the date till which they need to be under home quarantine.Passengers under the low risk category C were also asked to sign a self-declaration letter for being under home quarantine. In the letter, the signee promises to co-operate and follow all safety measures of the government and have their passport revoked in case of violation. Meanwhile, those under a higher risk category would be shifted to quarantine facilities. District collector Dr TG Vinay and deputy director of health services Dr P Priya Raj oversaw the screening and stamping process at the airport. The mandatory stamping measure comes a day after some passengers without Covid-19 symptoms from Thursday’s flight from Dubai argued that they wanted to leave for home immediately and resisted going to a quarantine facility.The passengers from Dubai who arrived on Thursday and Friday were taken to two quarantine facilities, one at Chinna Udaipu and the other at Austinpatti. The facility at Chinna Udaipu has a capacity of 120 beds while that at Austinpatti has 60 beds. Both facilities are under strict police security with entry barred for both the public and press. On Friday, some of the passengers who arrived at the facilities the day before were let off for home quarantine after being screened and found to come under category C.One of the passengers who left the facility at Chinna Udaipu for home quarantine on Friday spoke about his experience to TOI. “We stayed overnight and they gave us food as well. A single room was given for four people as that’s how much they could accommodate. We merely underwent thermal screening before being let off because we already didn’t have any symptoms. However, it was surprising to see that they didn’t give us even masks. We had to use only the ones we bought in Dubai,” he said.

BHOPAL: The fall of the Congress government in Madhya Pradesh has swung the limelight back on BJP — and on the question of who would be the next chief minister.

While Shivraj Singh Chouhan is considered likely to get a fourth term as CM, a surprise choice cannot be ruled out, just as it happened with the nomination of state party chief.

At least four other names are doing the rounds in party circles — Union ministers Narendra Singh Tomar, Prahlad Patel and Thawar Chand Gehlot, and chief whip in assembly Narottam Mishra. The final call may be taken at the party’s parliamentary board meeting to be held in the next two to three days, say sources.

“The party will decide who will be the chief minister. As soldiers, we always stand by the party’s decision,” said Chouhan, who met outgoing CM Kamal Nath on Friday evening.

Sources in BJP said Chouhan’s popularity gives him the edge in the race. But things could change if RSS pitches for a top cadre, like it did during the election of state BJP president and, more recently, the Rajya Sabha nominations. The caste equation is also crucial when RSS is talking about ‘equality and social harmony.’

Caste factor may play key role in deciding next CM

The top BJP leadership will take a call on the matter. BJP legislators will meet here in a day or two to elect their leader,” said Narottam Mishra.

Tomar and Gehlot are said to be close to the Prime Minister, are among the contenders for the top slot in MP . According to party sources, both leaders have acceptance among the MLAs. Gehlot, a Scheduled Caste leader, has served in various capacities in the organisation, keeping close contact with the top leadership.

On the other hand, Tomar is among the top five ministers in the Modi 2.0 government. He is known for his organisational skills, but he also faces the challenge of ensuring the victory of rebel MLAs from Congress in the bypolls. They would be looking for their “fair share” after breaking away from Congress and leading to the collapse of the Kamal Nath government.

Tomar said, “BJP is not a public limited company. The party leadership will decide what to do and who will be the leader.” Leader of opposition Gopal Bhargava said, “It is up to the party parliamentary board to take a decision.”

BJP state chief V D Sharma and his predecessor Rakesh Singh echoed this, and said: “The party leadership will decide the chief minister. We are not among the contenders.” Sources say the caste equation may work against Narottam.

Earlier, despite Kamal Nath’s resignation before a floot test on Friday, BJP stuck to its plan that was finalized on Thursday night and brought all 106 party MLAs in a bus to the state assembly at 11am. Former CM Shivraj Singh Chouhan and state BJP president VD Sharma accompanied the MLAs.

At 1.40 pm, BJP MLAs reached the assembly and the road for the assembly was closed for common people. Though the resignation news broke by 12 noon and it was clear that no floor test will be conducted. Still BJP took no chance. By 2 pm, all BJP MLAs flashing victory signs went inside the assembly. No Congress MLA was present in the assembly.

About 273 private hostels are functioning in the district.

An official of the social welfare department said, “As most of the colleges had declared holidays and companies had issued work from home option to its employees, we initially thought of closing the private hostels to prevent gathering of occupants as a precautionary measure.”

However, after the hostel owners made a representation explaining about the practical problems in shutting down the hostels, no specific directions were issued to close the hostels, the official said. Only some hostels occupied by students were closed, he added.

“Not all the companies had asked its employees to work from home option. Some students had to attend their practical examinations. Also, some of the hostels are occupied by nurses and doctors in the city,” the official added.

It is not advisable for students from Kerala who are staying in private hostels in the city to go back to their hometown when the neighbouring state is seeing a spike in Covid-19 cases.

They said students may not do well in the exams as the schools would be closed for the next 10 days. The school associations requested the government to allow them to conduct special classes for Class X students, if the government is keen on conducting the exams as per schedule.

Their request has gained significance in the wake of the high court ordering the Telangana government to postpone the ongoing Class X exams.

KSN Murthy, chairman, AP Private Schools Association, said the state government has declared holidays for all educational institutions till March 31.

“Meanwhile, Class X public exams are scheduled to be held from March 31. We fear that the students may not fare well as there would be no monitoring for the next 10 days. Hence, we request the government to give us special permission to run classes for Class X students to clarify their doubts. Otherwise, the government can consider postponing the exams on the lines of CBSE, IIT-JEE and other exams. We have written to chief secretary on the issue,” said Murthy.

Murthy said they have assured the government that they would take all safety measures for students. “We request the government to give us permission to run classes for Class 10 students or postpone the exams,” said Murthy.

The Class 10 examinations were scheduled to be held from March 23 but the state government postponed it due to local body elections.

On March 16, the election commission postponed the elections for six weeks due to Covid-19 situation.

His throat swabs were lifted and could be tested in the newly inaugurated Covid-19 testing centre on the hospital premises. The testing centre began functioning from Friday evening. With an increasing load of people requiring testing and isolation, ‘108’ has allotted two more ambulances exclusively for novel coronavirus cases.

At least six people are in the isolation wards of ESI Hospital and CMCH . The test results of four people, including a couple from Mettupalayam and two girls with travel history to Spain and Bengaluru, are still awaited. They are currently in isolation wards.

On Friday evening, collector K Rajamani inaugurated the regional level Covid-19 testing facility at CMCH. It has been established within the hospital’s laboratory space to test throat swabs, from patients with symptoms, coming from across the western region. They recently completed the quality control check mandated by the National Institute of Virology, Pune, after which the institute sent the necessary medical kit to the hospital. “This would help us get results faster, in around six hours, compared to us getting results from Chennai which often takes close to 48 hours,” an official said.

After inaugurating the centre, Rajamani said they had tested 27 people in the district so far, of which 16 have tested negative. The results of the remaining 11 people are awaited. While four of the 11 are awaited from Chennai, seven of them would be tested in CMCH’s testing laboratory.

108 has allotted two more ambulances to exclusively transport people with Covid-19 symptoms to CMCH and ESI Hospital for testing. “We earlier had only one ambulance allotted for this purpose, now we have three. Stationed at the airport, ESI Hospital in Singanallur and another at CMCH,” said Muthukrishnan , the 108-ambulance administrator in Coimbatore.

186,['21/03/2020'],Goa first to launch self-assessment tool for Covid-19,"Panaji: After introducing the country’s first chatbot for information on corona virus, Goa has now launched the nation’s first digital initiative to tackle the novel corona virus (Covid-19) by helping patients to identify if they are infected by the virus, or at risk for infection.

The digital interface, which was launched in Goa by health minister Vishwajit Rane on Saturday, is part of the state’s efforts to prevent the spread of the virus and to identify at-risk patients.

Globally, more than 2 lakh people have been infected.

Through the online portal, citizens can check from their homes if they have any of the symptoms of the virus. Individuals who feel that they might have been exposed to corona virus patients can also check if they are at risk and if they need to be self-quarantined by answering six questions, about the individual’s symptoms, travel history, history of contact with a Covid-19 suspect, and medical history, based on which their risk will be assessed.

The government has partnered with a US firm, Innovaccer Inc, to launch this tool.

“The partnership with Innovaccer is one of the critical elements in our government’s strategy to address the COVID-19 pandemic in Goa and the nation. We are proud to be the first state in India to adopt technology solutions to tackle coronavirus and launch the first app to enable patients to self-assess their vulnerability to the Covid-19 virus,” Rane said.

Innovaccer is a San Francisco-based healthcare technology company that works with global healthcare providers. The firm has developed the digital platform to help reduce the load on medical professionals so that doctors can focus on the critical corona virus cases.

“With our patient-focused mobile and web self-assessment, we help with initial triaging and screening, so that caregivers can focus on the highest risk individuals and more effectively deal with the increased request for services,” said Innovaccer chief executive officer Abhinav Shashank.

Rane said the self-assessment tool is available in English, Konkani and Hindi and also works on mobile devices. “The steps which we have taken in Goa over the past few days, and after the video conference with the Prime Minister, we feel that the proactive steps that Goa has taken are in line with the directions of the Prime Minister,” Rane said.

According to sources, nearly 60 per cent of the around 12,000 buses of the Andhra Pradesh public transport department went off the roads since March 1. Moreover, nearly 95% of private transport services such as air-conditioned buses and cabs have also gone off the road.

K Ravi Raju, chairman of Uttarandhra Tourist Buses and Contract Carriers’ Welfare Association (UTBCCOW) said that private travels have shut down completely. The state has nearly one lakh private vehicles, including 2,000 tourist buses in north-coastal Andhra Pradesh.

Raju said that private travel agencies are incurring a loss of Rs 25 crore daily and that tourists seem to have cancelled all bookings. “We have requested chief minister YS Jaganmohan Reddy to not collect quarterly tax for the period of April to June,” Raju told TOI.

Ravi Raju, who is also a member of the The Bus and Car Operators Confederation of India (BOCI), said that they have brought their woes to the notice of Union transport minister Nitin Gadkari.

Another private travel operator said that nearly 3 lakh families depend on the transport sector in the state directly and indirectly. “We have to pay salaries to them. The government should hold a meeting with us on how to overcome the financial burden,” the operator said.

Ravi Kumar, executive director Vizianagaram zone of Andhra Pradesh public transport department said that all air-conditioned buses have been stopped. “The government has also instructed us to not operate buses if there is no demand. We are also thinking about our action plan for the ‘janata curfew’ on March 22,” Kumar said.

189,['21/03/2020'],"Rane moots virology institute, lab in Goa","Panaji: Along with a dedicated virology lab for rapid diagnostic tests and isolation of virus strains, the state government also aims to set up a National Institute of Virology in Goa, said health minister Vishwajit Rane on Saturday.

Addressing the media, Rane said that chief minister Pramod Sawant has cleared a proposal to grant state funding for the virology lab and parallelly, a proposal has been sent to the Union health ministry to provide central funds for the facility.

“We have been talking about a virology lab and this discussion has taken place with the central government officials. The chief minister has already cleared the file as far as the state’s share is concerned,” said Rane. The health minister said that Goa is seeking just over Rs 3 crore as funding for the facility.

Rane also justified the need for a branch of the virology research institute in Goa, pointing out that the neighbouring regions lack such a facility.

Goa Medical College (GMC) and hospital has been sending the blood samples of all those individuals suspected of carrying the coronavirus to a Pune-based laboratory for testing.

This leads to delays and also puts a strain on the Pune facility, said doctors.

“We have put up a letter to Union minister Harsh Vardhan to help us set up a branch of National Institute of Virology in Goa because we are dealing with places right from Sindhadurg to Hubballi,” said Rane.

He said that once the funds are received, Goa will take up the construction of the virology lab “on a war footing” though he did not say when he expected the construction to happen.

Discussing Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s video conference, which was held on Friday, Rane said that the state will do all it can to combat the spread of the disease which has infected around 280 people in India.

The state health department has decided to impose fresh restrictions at GMC to prevent the likely transmission of coronavirus.

Rane announced that elective surgeries and non-emergency procedures have been cancelled.

“At GMC, there must be a thermal scanner, they must check the temperature of every person coming to the hospital. Only one person will be allowed with a patient at GMC. We will have a pass system and if you don’t have a pass, you will be out of the hospital,” said Rane.

He also said that only emergency cases should come to GMC’s outpatient department (OPD) and casualty section.

192,['21/03/2020'],Community transmission of Covid on the anvil,"With a mere 223 positive cases within a population of 1.3 billion, there is a burning question in the minds of many experts whether India is under-reporting.There are strict conservative criteria for Covid-19 testing. Currently, only people with travel history in the last 14 days with symptoms suggestive of coronavirus and those who have come in contact with confirmed cases are being tested. Patients admitted with severe acute respiratory illnesses requiring hospital admission without any travel and contact history are not being tested. This, however, contradicts the government’s own definition of “suspect cases”, which includes a category of people who do not have such history. In other words, despite not having travel and contact history, “suspect cases” do not qualify for testing.Community transmission happens when an individual tests positive for Covid-19, with no trace to the source of infection. Testing must be extended to people having flu-like symptoms & to “suspect cases” on a large scale involving the ICMR approved and NABL accredited laboratories. Logically, unless a significant number of “suspect cases” are tested, one cannot come to a reasonable conclusion that there is no evidence of community transmission.Why is it vitally important to know if there is community transmission? Firstly, accurate diagnosis would help in precisely identifying those that are sick so that appropriate care is provided to them. Those in the community who have been tested positive with mild symptoms could be advised self isolation, which would go a long way in minimising the exponential spread of the virus. Secondly, if an individual has been tested positive, one can diligently trace the contacts (“contact tracing”) and test them, and if they turn out positive, they could be isolated as well. Thirdly, testing the “suspect cases” gives an opportunity for hospitals to be better prepared regarding the likelihood of how many cases they could expect.Currently, India has tested only 14,000 people. This is in striking contrast to a small country like South Korea which has a population equivalent to Tamil Nadu) that tests 12,000 – 15,000 people every day. Countries such as Singapore, Hong Kong, Taiwan, China and indeed South Korea have been able to “flatten the curve”(ie, measures that keep the daily number of disease cases at a manageable level for medical providers) through innovative ways of diligently testing in the community.Currently, only seven states have closed down all the public places in an attempt ensure “social distancing”.Although the virus is asymptomatic and associated with mild infection in the vast majority, 5% of patients require ICU care. India does not have even one hospital bed per 1,000 people and has a dismally small number of some 70,000 ICU beds that cater to some 5 million patients that require ICU admissions every year. God forbid, should the community transmission transform to fully blown epidemic, India would barely be in a position to deal with the catastrophic dimensions of an impending crisis.(Dr. P.

This meant that almost 2,630 health workers were infected in Italy, of which 13 have died.Other than physical and mental exhaustion, problems in access to personal protective equipment (PPE) is what is adding to the risk of infection among medics. “Medical staff have been prioritized in many countries, but PPE shortages have been described in the most affected facilities. Alongside concerns for their personal safety, health care workers are anxious about passing the infection to their families,” noted the editorial.The New York Times too reported on doctors and nurses in the US struggling with shortage of PPEs.

AMARAVATI: In a big boost to medical infrastructure in the state, the Centre has sanctioned three new medical colleges to the state. The new colleges would come up in Paderu (Visakhapatnam), Gurazala (Guntur) and Machilipatnam (in Krishna district).

The Centre, which initially declined to grant the new colleges to the state, finally cleared the decks for setting up three new colleges under Central Sponsored Scheme (CSS).

As per the CSS, the Centre is sanctioning new colleges only in the districts where there are no medical colleges in private and government sector. The state government contended that they were going to create at least 12 new districts in the state and urged the Centre to grant the new colleges in the new districts to be formed.

The Centre would bear 60% of the project cost with the state contributing the remaining 40%.

Each college would be set up with a cost of Rs 325 crore. As per the MoU to be signed between the Centre and the State, Union health ministry would sanction Rs 195 crore to each medical college leaving the state to share Rs 130 crore.

The new colleges would come up in the existing referral or district hospitals. Interestingly, chief minister YS Jaganmohan Reddy had recently directed the medical and health officials to ready proposals for setting up at least one government medical college in each Lok Sabha constituency. At least seven more colleges were expected to be proposed in the second phase.

After hearing the initial arguments, the bench of Chief Justice Ramesh Ranganathan and Justice Ramesh Chandra Khulbe clubbed the petition with the public interest litigation (PIL) filed by senior BJP leader and Rajya Sabha MP, Subramanian Swamy and gave the state government and chief executive officer (CEO) of Devsthanam Board four weeks’ time to respond.

As reported by TOI earlier, Swamy had filed the PIL in the court on request of several priests who had met him and urged him to intervene in the matter.

Swamy had alleged that the takeover of temples was “in violation of the fundamental rights guaranteed to citizens including Hindu citizens and denominations under Articles 25, 26 and 29(1) of the Constitution.” Swamy had further said that the court should put a stay on the Act but the HC refused the stay and asked the government for its response.

There are close to 320 such centres in the district. Collector K Rajamani said the centres would be closed from Saturday.

The state-run online service centres usually attract a handsome number of people who want to apply for aadhar card, nativity certificate, community certificate, income certificate and legal heir certificate, among others.

A government official, who didn’t want to be named, said, “Biometric system is used to record one’s fingerprints while applying for aadhar card. As the same machine is used for the purpose, chances of spreading virus from a person to others are high. To avoid the situation, especially when the health emergency has been declared, the district administration has decided to close the e-seva centres.”

Meanwhile, most of the temples and Isha Yoga Centre in the district are closed for visitors. The collector said, “No special prayers are allowed to be conducted on temple premises till March 31. We have appealed the mosques and churches not to conduct special prayers on their premises.”

Some of the churches have already closed their doors to visitors and called off Sunday prayers. In a statement, Isha Yoga Centre said the Dhyanalinga and Adiyogi premises would remain shut for visitors till further notice. Its founder Jaggi Vasudev has also postponed his engagements in Mumbai and Africa till the start of April.

AMARAVATI: In a big boost to medical infrastructure in the state, the Centre has sanctioned three new medical colleges to the state. The new colleges would come up in Paderu (Visakhapatnam), Gurazala (Guntur) and Machilipatnam (in Krishna district).

The Centre, which initially declined to grant the new colleges to the state, finally cleared the decks for setting up three new colleges under Central Sponsored Scheme (CSS).

As per the CSS, the Centre is sanctioning new colleges only in the districts where there are no medical colleges in private and government sector. The state government contended that they were going to create at least 12 new districts in the state and urged the Centre to grant the new colleges in the new districts to be formed.

The Centre would bear 60% of the project cost with the state contributing the remaining 40%.

Each college would be set up with a cost of Rs 325 crore. As per the MoU to be signed between the Centre and the State, Union health ministry would sanction Rs 195 crore to each medical college leaving the state to share Rs 130 crore.

The new colleges would come up in the existing referral or district hospitals. Interestingly, chief minister YS Jaganmohan Reddy had recently directed the medical and health officials to ready proposals for setting up at least one government medical college in each Lok Sabha constituency. At least seven more colleges were expected to be proposed in the second phase.

The plea, considered by Justice Shircy V, was in the case over the alleged murder of Jolly’s husband Roy Thomas.

Opposing the bail plea, prosecution had contended that delay in conducting the trial is not a ground for granting bail in a case considered to be the rarest of rare.

Jolly moved the HC after a court at Thamarassery and the Kozhikode district court rejected her bail pleas.

It was on September 30, 2011 that Roy Thomas was found in a weak condition in the bathroom of his house. Though he was taken to a hospital, he died. Police had concluded that it was a murder after investigating the death following complaints by relatives. Jolly was arrested in October 5.

While Jolly had cited delay in trial for seeking bail in the HC, the prosecution pointed out that she was an accused in the murders of her second husband Shiju’s wife Sili, their child Alfine, Roy’s mother Annamma, relatives Machadiyil Mathew and Tom Thomas. tnn

He told protesters it was the state’s prerogative to decide where a quarantine facility would come up and who would be admitted there.

Rane also stated that in times of an epidemic and under the Epidemic Diseases Act, the department of health services can requisition even private hospitals and hotels to quarantine infected persons.“Some people are telling us where to have a coronavirus quarantine. It is nobody’s jurisdiction to tell us where to have a quarantine. The collector will decide,” Rane said.

The state government has decided to utilise the top two floors of the ESI hospital at Margao to quarantine international and domestic passengers who have travelled to coronavirus hotspots. A 14-day quarantine has been made mandatory for such passengers as a precautionary measure.

Some flights from the Middle East continue to arrive at Goa airport, but with barely any passengers. Those flying in from the UAE are screened and based on symptoms and travel history, are marked for either self-quarantine or government quarantine.

Based on the trajectory taken by the virus in the country and the state, the authorities are empowered to have quarantine facilities across Goa, the health minister said. “I can take over an entire private hospital or hotel if required. We have told private hospitals that we will utilise their facilities if required,” he said.

NAGPUR: Amid the clamp down to prevent Covid-19 spread, bank counters were operating at full swing with customers also queuing up in good numbers. Even as sales and back-end staff have been asked to work from home, bank branches , which have general public visiting, were seen running with full strength on Friday.

Industries too preferred to only allow managerial and other white collared employees to stay at home. There was no reduction in workers on the shop floor. Factory workers had to report to work as usual in MIDC’s industrial areas at Hingna and Butibori. The state government has issued directives to all private establishments to operate at 50% manpower.

The Ordnance Factory Board (OFB) in Kolkata has issued orders to work at half strength, which will be effective from Monday, said a senior official here. The order covers workers also. There are three ordnance factories in the region.

TOI paid a cursory visit to branches of HDFC Bank, ICICI Bank, SBI, Yes Bank , IDFC First, Axis Bank and IDBI Bank. Except at Yes Bank, the crowds were normal to near normal levels elsewhere. A source in SBI said an order to keep the workforce at half was received in the afternoon. However, this only covers administrative offices and not branches.

At SBI’s main branch at Kingsway all the tables were manned, with as many visitors as there would have been on any other day. A notice at the door requested customers to avoid coming to the bank, and use net banking instead. There was a similar scene at private banks too. Sources said rural branches of PSU banks too had visitors in usual numbers.

At private and new generation private banks, branch heads, who refused to come on record, also accepted that they were working full strength.

AT IDBI Bank in Civil Lines, a tape was tied over a meter away from some of the staffers’ tables to prevent customers from coming closer.

A representative of Confederation of Indian Industries (CII) told TOI that he had inquired with the management of Mahindra and Mahindra, Ashok Leyland , Ceat and JSW here. The officials said that administrative staff has been asked to work from home. However, as production cannot continue with 50% workforce, the rule has not been made applicable in production facilities yet. The workers are being taken in after thermal scanning to check their temperatures, said the source.

The income tax department has made the 50% staff norm applicable for Group B and C employees. However, Group A staff that include senior officers and Group D — the lowest rung have not been included. The AG office too has implemented the staff cut, but PSU insurance giant LIC continued with full strength, said sources. WCL will also implement the order for administrative employees, but not for staff operating mines.

Visakhapatnam: At around 4pm on Friday, health workers of the emergency unit of the century-old King George Hospital kept to their business as usual. Doctors, nurses and other health workers were all busy treating patients and consoling patients’ relatives.

The reception desk at the entrance of the main building has been transformed into a makeshift Covid-19 helpdesk. Two women health workers were busy trying to comfort relatives of patients who have been admitted into the Covid-19 isolation ward at the hospital.

While Visakhapatnam went indoors on Friday afternoon, for the health workers, there is no option. Not only are they at their jobs, they are working longer hours.

“What do we do? We have to ensure that the emergency ward is open round-the-clock. There’s apprehension of a complete lock down and people have been asked to state indoors. But our role doesn’t change,” said a junior doctor who did not wish to be named.

A stone’s throw away from KGH is the Jagadamba Market, one of the busiest markets in the city. But on Friday, the whole locality bore a deserted look. However, traffic policemen remained on duty. Two traffic constables were posted at the Dutch Cemetery crossing. Besides manning traffic as usual, they had another responsibility on Friday afternoon: To divert all vehicles towards Seven Hills Hospital and to make sure that no vehicles take the Judge’s Court Road that leads to Alipuram, the neighbourhood of city’s only Covid-19-affected patient.

While Prime Minister Narendra Modi has asked people to stay indoors on Sunday, most city residents chose to stay back on Friday afternoon as well. The exceptions are these doctors, nurses, health workers, policemen and sanitation workers. “There’s no notice about sweepers not working. Under the current circumstances, it is important to keep the city’s environment clean. So I don’t think sweepers will be asked to stay home,” a GVMC official said.

The advisory depicts simple ways to prevent the spread of the virus in dairy cooperatives/dairy plants through clean and hygienic practices, avoiding physical contact via handshakes, conducting meetings via video conferencing, restricting entry of visitors/screening visitors, social distancing, arranging quarantine and testing facilities for suspect cases among others.

“Given the gravity of situation, it is important to act in mutual solidarity and take all possible steps to ensure timely control of COVID-19 and avoid undesirable consequences,” he said.

Ahmedabad: A 69-year-old Maninagar resident, Bhagwatiprasad Dave, lodged a complaint at Maninagar police station on Thursday that Melbourne-based Hardik Pathak and his father Harnishkumar cheated him of Rs 30 lakh. Dave retired from the Indian Railways as senior section engineer in 2011 and now works for a private company.

According to the FIR lodged by Dave, his son Rahul went to Australia in 2010 to study hotel management. There he came into contact with Hardik, at the Rangavdhoot Panthank Ashram. They became friends, so much that Hardik gave Rahul a job in his Indian restaurant in Sydney.Dave said that in 2016, Hardik told him that as his partner in the restaurant was exiting, he would need some money.

He also told Rahul that as his father had just retired he would have money, and asked for it saying he would return it as soon as possible. Rahul spoke to his father about lending Hardik money. Later Hardik made Harnishkumar speak to Dave, who guaranteed him the return of the money in one year.

“According to the FIR, in 2016, the senior Dave gave Hardik Rs 30 lakh in instalments. In 2017, when Dave went to Australia to attend a social function arranged by his son, he met Hardik and asked for the money. Hardik told Dave that he would return it as soon he returned to India or send it with Rahul and his wife, but that did not happen,” said a police official.

The FIR states that in November 2019, Hardik came his home town Rajpipla. Both Rahul and he went to the house and asked for the money. Hardik told them that he would return the money in two or three months but despite several reminders he did not return the money and returned to Australia.

HYDERABAD: The state transport department has reduced slot bookings for vehicle registrations from 400 to 80 per day to prevent overcrowding in RTA premises. However, the decision has not been welcomed by owners of BS-IV vehicles, who must complete the registration by March 31 as per SC orders.

“RTA officials should have extended their working hours or kept the offices open on Sundays instead of reducing the number of slots for registration. I have been trying to book a slot for the last two days. If this continues, I may have to scrap my vehicle after March 31,” said M Suryanarayana, a resident of Boiguda.

Just a couple of days before RTA decided to limit the number of registrations in all offices, the registration rush for BS-IV vehicles led officials to set up additional counters at the RTA offices.

Another applicant Shashank Gupta said, “I have three BS-IV vehicles to register before this month-end. I am not able to book slots despite trying for several hours. I understand that this is a precautionary measure considering the present circumstances, but the officials should also take into consideration our grievance.”

When TOI contacted the state transport department, officials said they are working out ways to ensure that applicants will be able to finish BS-IV vehicle registrations before deadline.

“The number of slots have been reduced keeping in view the threat of Covid-19. We are also working out an online facility so that applicants of BS-IV registration do not face any inconvenience. The new facility is likely to be ready by Saturday,” said joint transport commissioner (IT) C Ramesh.

229,['21/03/2020'],Farmers see red over new wheat procurement policy,"Pilibhit: With wheat procurement to commence from April 1, farmers are up in arms against the modifications introduced in the process of registration for wheat procurement for the current season.

Farmers alleged that the changes are complicated and time-consuming. These will adversely affect small and marginal farmers and are contrary to government’s claims of striving to remove middlemen from the procurement chain.

Till last year, farmers were required to provide their mobile phone numbers to be fed to the e-procurement system. Under the new system, farmers will now be sent an OTP (one time password) on their mobile phones by the e-procurement system in order to allow further functions of their registration with the government.

“The OTP has been made mandatory to ensure that the farmers feed their own mobile number to the system. This will ensure their availability for communication if and when needed.” said Avinash Jha, district food and marketing officer.

Earlier.all procurement agencies, except the food department. were using RTGS (Real Time Gross Settlement) method of banking to transfer the payment to farmers’ bank accounts. Now, government has now made ‘public financial management system’ (PFMS) mandatory for all agencies making payments to farmers.

Under, PFMS, after procuring paddy from a farmer, the concerned transaction is uploaded online by the procurement centre in-charge with his digital signature. Following this, the particulars of the farmer given in his bank account, the land ownership revenue documents and his registration with government website for paddy sale are verified by the district food and marketing officer and the regional accounts officer. Finally, the details are uploaded by the latter on PFMS for payment. This is a cumbersome process, say farmers.

“The application of PFMS led to long delays in payment to farmers in the last paddy procurement season. Now, with all procurement agencies are being subject to follow this system, it will only add to farmers’ woes,” said VM Singh, national convener of the All India Kisan Sangharsh Coordination Committee

Lastly, an SDM will be will have to verifiy land brought under land consolidation(chakbandi) system. But the revenue documents of these lands are not available online. A farmer who has exchanged land under “chakbandi” process can get himself registered for wheat procurement only after obtaining a verification certificate.

A farmer of Khandepur village, Manjit Singh, who is also the state secretary of the Rashtriya Lok Dal (RLD), said marginal and small farmers will be denied access to the procurement system as the new policy is complicated and time-consuming. Therefore, they will turn to middlemen to sell their produce.

Rajkot: With its first coronavirus case turning positive, the city has virtually locked itself up inside homes on Friday. Empty roads, sparse traffic, closed shops, markets and business establishments have mirrored the panic that has gripped the citizens from contracting the dreaded virus.

Even the city’s gold market, one of the biggest in Gujarat, where over 70,000 workers are engaged in making jewellery has shut down till Tuesday looking at the heavy reduction in business. Jewellery design from Rajkot not only enjoys huge demand across the country, but also in foreign markets.

President of Rajkot gold dealer’s association, Bhayabhai Soni said, “Looking at the safety concerns of our customers and also the workers and employees, we have unanimously decided to keep our shops shut till Tuesday.”

He further said that the decision to open market from Wednesday onwards will also be taken according to the situation then. More than 400 jewellers are engaged in the city’s gold industry. According to the market sources, the decision to shut down has been taken to minimize the risk of virus spread from the congested sitting arrangements for the workers in old Soni market and also its narrow lanes.

The main markets in the city including Dharmendra Road, Lakhaji Raj Road, Yagnik Road and 150feet Ring Road registered very scanty footfall during the day as scared customers imposed self quarantine on themselves.

The Rajkot Municipal Corporation (RMC) ordered shutting down of all tea and paan kisoks on the road. Municipal commissioner Udit Agarwal said, “We have allowed shops to remain open because we don’t want to promote black market, but there is a notification of the police commissioner prohibiting the assembly of more then four persons even in shops.

These virtual courts will have video conferencing facilities and advocates whose urgent matters are listed for the day will be allotted time slots.

The lawyers will argue before these virtual courts and their arguments will be heard by judges from their court rooms or chambers. This is done to avoid crowding at district courts. Public prosecutors and government pleaders too would be arguing cases from these virtual court rooms, said Radha Krishna Chauhan, registrar (IT) of the HC.

Similar arrangements were made in the HC too. Only four or five advocates would be allowed inside when their time slot, he said. While virtual courts already started functioning in the districts, this facility would be implemented in the HC from March 23, he said.

The HC had already called upon the bar associations and lawyers to ensure that footfall in the courts is minimal on any given day for the next few weeks in order to curb the spread of the virus.

Each team consists of GHMC, police, health and revenue official. “We got a list of passengers from the government. If any passenger, who has been told to be under home quarantine, is found to be flouting the rule, they will be shifted to isolation ward,” said a GHMC official.

However, in some cases either the passenger no longer resides at the address or is again travelling. GHMC officials confirmed that in most circles there were aberrations in address. “The address taken from the passports has been found to be outdated,” said an official on condition of anonymity.

T Yadaiah, deputy commissioner (Alwal circle) said: “We were told about four passengers in this circle. One address was incorrect and we could not trace the individual. Another said he is on vacation in Kerala. Both came from abroad.”

In Mehdipatnam circle, deputy commissioner MK Ali, said there were three to four similar cases. “We have been asked to track 159 people. A few were not found at stated addresses.”

In Serilingampally, deputy commissioner Sri Venkanna, said there were 10 such cases. He said, “When we went to one address we found the passenger had shifted long ago to Bhimavaram in AP. But we have been able to trace all the passengers.”

GHMC officials could not confirm what was being done about passengers who were in other states or if their details would be sent to respective authorities to track.

238,['21/03/2020'],Int’l flyers to be segregated into 3 categories,"Hyderabad: With large number of international passengers expected to return till 1.30am on March 23 — as per health ministry’s advisory — central security agencies instructed state machinery to segregate passengers into A, B, C categories at RGIA while screening them. This will be done instead of sending all passengers, particularly those flying in from the 11 specified countries, to state-run quarantine centres. Sources said about 10 to 12 international flights are expected to land in the city on Saturday.

The central security agencies intervened on Thursday since the state government recently took a decision to quarantine all passengers coming in from Kuwait, the UAE, Oman and Qatar, China, Iran, South Korea, Italy, Spain, Germany, and France. This led to chaos at the airport and also saw some people protest at quarantine centre in Rajendra Nagar, on Thursday. Also, in majority of other airports in India, international passengers are being categorised as A, B,C depending on screening results.

All passengers will be screened by medical teams using infrared thermometer. This will be done before the passengers reach immigration check. Only passengers who test positive will be segregated and declared as category A and sent to state-run quarantine facility.

Among remaining passengers, those above 60 years will be segregated again — after they clear immigration and customs — following enquires by medical staff. Only those with a history of health issues, will be sent to quarantine centre and put in B category. The remaining will be treated as C category and will be suggested to be on home or self-quarantine.

“With the Centre suspending all international flights from Match 23, we expect heavy inflow of passengers. CISF requested the state to follow categorisation system at RGIA and not quarantine every passenger from the notified 11 countries, which is leading to problems,” a source at RGIA told TOI. However, as of now there is no foolproof check for domestic travellers, due to logistical and other reasons.

The move, announced by the PM during a national address on Thursday, seeks to keep people indoors between 7am and 9pm on Sunday in a bid to stall the spread of the novel coronavirus.

State transport buses, those being operated under the BRTS mechanism, as well as city buses will be off the roads in the state on Sunday, the CM said. “There is Janta curfew on Sunday in Gujarat. Services of ST, BRTS and city buses will remain shut during Sunday. We all need to observe Janta curfew on that day to contain the spread of the virus,” he said.

The state has reported five Covid-19 cases, including three on Friday.

“People who have recently returned from abroad need to undergo home quarantine voluntarily. Children and elderly people should not go out. People should avoid going out unless it is absolutely necessary.

We must keep one meter distance with others while we are out,” he said in a video message. “We all need to strictly follow PM Modi's appeal of Janta curfew on Sunday by remaining in our homes between 7:00am and 9:00pm. This is in the interest of the people. I am confident that we will be able to stop the spread of virus with our collective efforts,” said Rupani.

The state government has already ordered the closure of schools, colleges, tuition classes, gyms, water parks, multiplexes, party plots and other public places, like temples and the well-patronised State of Unity, to combat the outbreak.PTI

RAJAHMUNDRY: The Union Jal Shakti ministry has agreed, in principle, to sanction Rs 419.45 crore under the National River Conservation Project . The budget will be sanctioned in order to prepare a comprehensive plan to ensure that untreated water does not enter River Godavari .

The plant will include the construction of a sewage treatment plant (STP), I&D (interception and diversion) facilities, laying of trunk mains, sub mains, lateral sewer lines, inspection chambers and house service connections within the ambits of Rajahmundry Municipal Corporation.

The nearly 5.6lakh population of Rajahmundry will benefit from this move. Moreover, downstream of River Godavari is a source of drinking water for the population of East and West Godavari.

Currently, the sewage treatment plant is able to process only 30MLD (million litres per day) with up-flow anaerobic sludge. The requirement is of 66MLD.

The UASB (upflow anaerobic sludge blanket) technology built in 2003 needs an upgrade to meet the standards set by the National Green Tribunal (NGT) and the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB). There is no underground drainage system in Rajahmundry.

Speaking to TOI, OM Prakash, superintending engineer at the Rajahmundry Municipal Corporation confirmed the sanctioning of the amount and said that the amount is slated to be released in the 2020-21 fiscal.

Prakash said that three more sewage treatment plants will be constructed and the existing STP will be upgraded by making use of the funds.

HYDERABAD: Coronavirus has cast its spell on policing too. Four teams of cops from Hyderabad, who were investigating various cases in north and east Indian states, have been called back as police top brass doesn’t want to take any chance. Cops, who are in their 50s, are not deployed at the airport after some of them started showing symptoms like fatigue and cough.

“On an average, four teams from my zone are in other states as part of investigation at any given time. Right now, no team is working outside Telangana, mainly due to Covid-19. However, if there is a big property offence or a kidnapping or a murder case that requires travel to other states, the teams will have to go,” said a DCP in Hyderabad.

As part of the investigation, 10 to 15 teams from three police commissionerates go to other states every day to arrest the accused, to recover stolen property or to gather evidence.

Given the present situation, a decision has been taken by top police brass to send teams only in high priority cases.

Rachakonda police commissioner Mahesh Bhagwat said that travel to other states by police teams is being decided based on priority of the case. “Teams that have to travel outside the state are advised to go in police department vehicles instead of trains or flights to reduce contact with number of people,” he said.

After detection of multiple Covid-positive cases, police are assisting revenue and health officials in tracking foreigners as well as Indians who came from abroad.

Police are busy checking if those who have returned from 11 countries are sticking to home quarantine or not.

The panchayats will spend Rs 12.5 lakh on each Vaikunta dhamam by providing facilities such as platforms, washrooms and other amenities required for family members who come to give farewell to the departed.

The gram panchayats will have the liberty to spend more and develop bigger dhamams if individuals, families, groups, institutions and corporates come forward to donate money, land or both and or some of the facilities.

“The chief minister is serious on this. He is committed to transforming the gram panchayats as model villages. The government is releasing Rs 339 crore every month to all the panchayats despite the economic slowdown,” said a senior official.

“The government has done all it could do and will not tolerate lethargy or non-achievement of targets and failure to develop villages,” said the official.

KCR did not stop reprimanding his own party leaders for indulging in publicity when it came to development of villages. The chief minister took a serious view of some ministers, elected representatives and senior officials, including some district collectors, taking part in cleanliness drives on streets.

“KCR has made it clear that sweeping the streets with a broomstick is not the job of ministers, elected representatives and officials. Instead, they should ensure that employees assigned to carry out such work should do it. Such activities for the sake of media publicity will not be encouraged,” a senior official quoting KCR said.

The administration is now engaged in containing the spread of Covid-19 in all districts.Earlier in the day, State Election Commission ( SEC ) gave the green signal for the distribution of house sites following a request by the state government.The government had planned to distribute house sites (pattas) for 26.6 lakh poor people on Telugu New Year day, Ugadi (March 25). However, the SEC had halted the programme when it issued the notification to conduct elections to local bodies. The SEC’s decision had sparked a controversy as the government had criticized the move stating that it was a ongoing scheme not the one announced in the middle of the elections.The issue had got complicated when the SEC announced continuation of the model code of conduct even after the postponement of the elections as part of the measures to contain the spread of Covid-19.The government received a breather when the Supreme Court directed the election commission to lift the model code of conduct in view of the uncertainty prevailed over the next schedule of the elections.Curiously, the state government decided to defer the programme to Ambedkar Jayanthi (April 14) after getting the green signal from the SEC. The decision was taken at a review meeting chaired by chief minister YS Jaganmohan Reddy on Friday.The CM asked the officials to ensure that there should be a social distance while taking beneficiaries to inspect their plots. The CM directed the officials to complete the draw of lots to allocate the plots to the beneficiaries.He said that all the beneficiaries should be taken to the site and their photo should be captured at the site for geo-tagging. The CM said that it would be a new record to give house sites to 26 lakh people in one go.

MUMBAI: Moments after Yes Bank promoter Rana Kapoor was remanded to judicial custody on Friday, his defence urged the court to send him to a jail barrack in a larger yard to mitigate his chances of contracting coronavirus.

Judge P B Jadhav sent 62-year-old Kapoor to judicial custody until April 2. Rana was first taken to Arthur Road jail and at 6pm, was moved to Taloja jail . He was arrested on March 8 in connection with a scam involving Dewan Housing Finance Corporation Ltd (DHFL) and was in ED custody until Friday.

Rana’s defence team, led by senior counsel Abad Ponda and advocate Subhash Jadhav, told the court that their client suffered from respiratory ailments and was under treatment for depression. Calling his situation “precarious”, Ponda submitted, “He is a senior citizen who is very susceptible to this disease (coronavirus). He’s an asthmatic person having various respiratory problems and has very very (sic) low immunity...They can keep him in yard number 10 and 12 (of Arthur Road jail). With a larger yard, there is a greater possibility of him being safe.” Ponda urged the court to send him to either Arthur Road or Thane jail. Special public prosecutor Sunil Gonsalves submitted that Arthur Road jail had stopped taking new inmates as it was full. “The option available is Thane jail or Taloja. But if Thane jail is full, then he will have to be taken to Taloja,” he said. The court directed the authorities concerned to consider Kapoor’s medical papers and keep him in the appropriate jail and barrack.

Meanwhile, the CBI, which has also registered cases against Kapoor, will seek his custody soon. On Friday, it obtained his production warrant in connection with the DHFL case.

BENGALURU: Starting Saturday, Metro trains may not stop at crowded stations. Also, passengers aged 60 and above and children below 10 will be barred from boarding the trains.

To ensure social distancing, BMRCL on Friday said each train will accommodate only 150 passengers, leaving alternate seats empty. No commuter will be allowed to travel standing. It has also advised passengers to maintain at least one-metre distance from each other while approaching a queue for security scanning, purchasing tickets and entering AFC gates and platforms.

“Trains may not stop at crowded stations, where the expected distance of one meter between passengers is not possible,” said BMRCL chief public relations officer BL Yashavanth Chavan.

However, it’s still unclear which stations would be skipped.

The BMRCL urged passengers to use Metro only for essential and unavoidable travel. “The train service is to be made available on priority to personnel who are required to maintain essential services,” said Chavan.

Also, random thermal scanning of passengers would be carried out at stations.

“Skipping of crowded stations will come into play only if social distancing isn’t followed,” said Ajay Seth, BMRCL managing director.

PUNE: An alert security guard foiled an attempt to steal a public sector bank’s ATM in Lonavla on Thursday.

The guard, who was patrolling the premises of the bank in the early hours, heard a loud thud in the kiosk and immediately raised an alarm. The thieves abandoned the attempt to steal the machine and fled in a pickup truck.

A team of the Lonavla City police , which reached the spot quickly, tried to chase the vehicle, but the suspects managed to make their getaway.

The police later found that the pickup truck too was stolen from Lonavla. “We have recovered the vehicle,” a police officer said.

The ATM kiosk of the public sector bank is located next to the bank’s branch in Lonavla. The kiosk has two machines — a cash deposit machine and one ATM. The bank has appointed a security guard, who was inside the branch, when the incident happened.

Police said the suspects reached the kiosk in the truck around 2.30am. “They first obscured the lens of the CCTV cameras inside the kiosk, tied a rope to the ATM and connected it to the truck,” the officer said.

The officer said the suspects started the truck and tried to uproot the machine, when it fell on the floor with a crash. “The guard, who was inside the bank, was alerted and looked out of the window to see what was happening,” the officer said, adding, “ When he noticed the suspects, he raised an alarm.” The guard also immediately alerted the bank officials and the police too. “Sensing danger, the suspects fled,” the officer said.

“We have started collecting CCTV footage to trace them,” the officer said.

Second incident in a week

In the early hours of Monday, an ATM of a private bank, containing Rs5.90 lakh, was stolen from Lonikand. The suspects had used a pickup truck to steal the machine, which was unguarded.

BENGALURU: Does your property have more built-up area than what was approved in the building plan? Then, be ready to cough up double the property tax.

The assembly on Friday passed the Karnataka Municipal Corporations (Amendment) Bill 2020 which seeks to collect a penalty equivalent to property tax on any building constructed without permission or in violation of building bylaws.

The move will come into force after the bill is passed by the legislative council and gets the governor’s assent. “The bill seeks to check unauthorised construction of buildings in Bengaluru and also penalise those who flout building bylaws,” said home minister Basavaraj Bommai , who piloted the bill on behalf of chief minister BS Yediyurappa. The penalty will be in proportion to the extent of violations, he said.

Accordingly, penal fee will be levied on the property tax for the additional area (in sqft) which has been annexed by way of violation. Bommai said the bill in no way seeks to regularise unauthorised buildings. His clarification came after Congress MLA HK Patil said the bill should not lead to regularisation of illegal buildings.

“It is a temporary feature and a penalty will be imposed till BBMP clears the violations. The bill doesn’t bar the Palike from taking action against bylaw violations,” said law and parliamentary affairs minister JC Madhuswamy. The bill also seeks to impose one-time fee and annual track rent for laying optical fibre cables in the city.

Disfigurement bill

The assembly also passed a bill to extend applicability of the Karnataka Open Places (Prevention of Disfigurement) Act to areas falling under Bangalore Development Authority or any other urban development or local planning authorities.

A spokesperson of Bounce, an app-based rental scooter firm, said: “We have seen a 10-15% drop in ridership in the past few days. We are urging people to use Bounce only if necessary.”Yulu Bikes, a micro-mobility firm, is also witnessing a decline in the number of takers. Amit Gupta, co-founder and CEO of Yulu Bikes, put the fall at 10%.While Ola and Uber refused to comment on the dip in ridership, many of their driver partners admit there is a drastic reduction in the bookings, especially for shared options like Ola Share and Uber Pool. In fact, some passengers say rides have become cheaper in the absence of surge pricing. Carpooling firms are also bearing the brunt but Quick Ride refused to comment.A survey conducted by MoveInSync , a corporate travel provider, between March 9 and 11, revealed there was 9% dip in cab usage by officegoers. However, the numbers may have increased by now.A spokesperson of bike taxi service Rapido said: “Ridership has not dropped much as it didn’t serve too many white-collar workers. The platform is mostly used by blue-collar workers, who don’t have the luxury to work from home. Also, our business is a lot less concentrated in metros. In tier 2 and 3 cities, impact of the virus isn’t being felt yet.”Firms takes precautionary stepsMobility firms, however, are bracing up for the challenge. “The safety of citizens is our topmost priority.

265,['21/03/2020'],"Coronavirus in Karnataka: When IT staff can work from home, why not us, ask senior MLAs","File photo of Hegde Kageri

BENGALURU: When tech company employees and other professionals can work from home, why can’t we? This is the question legislators are asking in the wake of the Centre announcing that people above 60 are at high risk of contracting Covid-19 and should stay indoors.

Of the 224 MLAs, 107 are aged above 60 and at least 75-80 per cent of the MLCs are in a similar age group. A majority of the senior MLAs told TOI they’re asking the speaker why the legislative session is not being terminated as part of measures to contain Covid-19. The senior politicians include chief minister BS Yediyurappa and leader of opposition Siddaramaiah, both septuagenarians.

However, the concerns raised by the legislators haven’t had an impact on the government, which is insisting on continuing with the ongoing budget session till March 31.

Speaker Vishweshwar Hegde Kageri said: “There are concerns, I know. I’m told this was discussed at the emergency cabinet meeting held a couple days ago, but we decided to stick to the session schedule. It is the government’s call. On our part, we are taking all possible preventive measures.” The steps he mentioned include screening at the entrance and providing hand sanitiser to visitors.

Earlier this week, the assembly hall was sanitised by spraying disinfectant and the general public was banned from the viewing gallery. But experts believe these steps are inadequate to check the spread of the pandemic.

“What is to be noted is that Covid-19 spreads more rapidly than any other virus. Restricting the number of people congregating at one place would be imperative. If the meeting of lawmakers is important and unavoidable, then let them meet in small numbers,” said Naresh Shetty, president of MS Ramaiah Memorial Hospital.

Recently, Congress MLA Anjali Nimbalkar admonished Vidhan Soudha staff members for being lax about the screening process.

Sources said Yediyurappa was initially in favour of postponing the session, but the BJP central leadership instructed him to continue with it and the CM is adhering to the same.

The regulatory compulsion is the passing of the budget, as the CM has tabled a full budget and it must be approved by March 31. Further, several key pieces of legislations have also been lined up for the duration of the legislature.

However, senior members in the house are suggesting the government table the vote-on-account to seek permission of the house to spend money for the next three or four months and pass the full budget in the continued budget session after the recess.

270,['21/03/2020'],"Winter water release halts, enough stock in dams to tide over summer","PUNE: The state irrigation department has stopped discharge of water into the Mutha canal after completing the release of water for winter crops. Water was released in two rotations. The second rotation was from the first week of February and it ended last week.

Discharge during winter was reduced by almost 2 TMC this year as compared to the usual release of 7 TMC because of less demand for water due to the extended rainfall, the state irrigation department said.

Saving of 2 TMC water during the winter rotations will meet Pune city’s water requirement for one and half months.

An official said about 2.5 TMC water was released in two rotations each for rural areas.

This year, the department adopted a demand and supply method under which water release was initiated only after a demand was registered from the farmers from rural areas.

“The method also helped save additional water in the reservoirs. The release was initiated two months later than the usual period of October when the rotations start,” officials said. Last year, the rains had continued even in November so no demand for water came from the rural areas in October.

The four dams that supply water to rural parts and Pune city areas have collective storage capacity of 29 TMC. Of this, about 15 TMC water is used for the city while remaining is released for rural parts through the canal.

Sources from the irrigation department said collective storage of water in the four dams, after the winter rotations, was much better when compared with last year.

The collective stock on Wednesday was 16 TMC (55%), which was about 6 TMC more than last year’s stock of 11 TMC in the same period.

Meanwhile, the irrigation department has said that a decision on water release for summer crops was expected soon. The release is likely to begin in April which will continue for a month.

“A meeting will be conducted by the district guardian minister to take stock in the dams and decide about the release of water during summer,” the official said.

The city is unlikely to face any water shortage this summer as there is adequate water stock in the dams.

“The dams have more than 50% stock. We are not expecting any cuts from the irrigation department in the supply to the city,” a senior corporator said.

The irrigation department should keep the civic body informed about the water release schedule for summer, he added.

NEW DELHI: India joined members of the Quad and New Zealand , Vietnam and South Korea to collaborate on combating the coronavirus pandemic currently sweeping through the world. Foreign secretary Harsh Shringla joined a telephonic conference call started by US deputy secretary of state Steve Biegun. According to a readout by the MEA, the teleconference included senior representatives from Australia, the Republic of Korea , Vietnam, New Zealand, and Japan These seven countries decided they would cooperate on “vaccine development, challenges of stranded citizens, assistance to countries in need and mitigating the impact on the global economy.” The top bureaucrats will henceforth confer weekly, said MEA in a statement.Meanwhile, foreign minister S Jaishankar and foreign secretary Harsh Shringla addressed Indian ambassadors to countries in Europe, south-east Asia and east Asia on Friday via separate video-conferences on Friday. Sources said, the conversation centred on bringing everyone on the same page on the Covid restrictions, and how to handle them. It was emphasised that communicating to community, assisting stranded students and others and mobilising resources were essential.The Quad-Plus video-conference was initiated by the US side and meant to start an initiative to share best practices, collaborate and synergise actions against Covid-19. On a larger canvas the effort is also an attempt to keep the Quad Plus countries within a certain sphere of influence and strategic direction. It is therefore significant to have New Zealand as one of the participants, given it is one of the Five Eyes countries; Vietnam is a valued partner of Japan, India and the US. South Korea is an interesting participant as well, not only as a strategic partner, but also a country which has successfully beaten back the coronavirus challenge.The call brought the Quad back into focus as one of the key groupings in the Indo-Pacific — one of their areas of collaboration was in humanitarian assistance/disaster relief (HADR). Taking it a step further, these countries, with significant scientific and technological heft, are planning to pool resources to work on emergency areas like vaccines. There are apparently almost two dozen projects globally that is working on vaccine for coronavirus. The chances of a vaccine discovery as part of a collaborative effort is deemed higher.“The participants shared their assessments of the current situation with respect to Covid-19, and discussed ways to synergise their efforts to counter its spread.”Shringla briefed the others on India’s national response as well as regional outreach as a result of PM Modi’s video-conference with Saarc leaders. According to the MEA, “He conveyed India’s desire to regularly share its perspectives with partners in the region and to work together with others to counter this challenge. The participants are expected to continue the conference call on a weekly basis.”Days after PM Narendra Modi announced a Saarc emergency Covid-19 fund, Nepal and Bhutan have contributed to the corpus which is intended to be used by countries in south Asia in their fight against the pandemic.

The lecturers started reporting at these camps on Friday. While the major part of the first day was dedicated for orientation, the evaluation will begin from Saturday and will go on at least until the third week of April.

In the state, the spot valuation will be carried out at a total of 12 camps, including four in Hyderabad and one in Karimnagar.

“Right now, we don’t know whether the valuation will be carried in shifts or not. Even if it is done in shifts, there will be at least 350-400 lecturers at any given point of time at each of these camps as evaluation of five subjects will be done parallelly. If not, more than 700-1000 lecturers will present at each camp,” said a principal of a government junior college which has been assigned spot valuation duties.

The lecturers said that even if the evaluation is conducted in two shifts — 7 am to 1 pm and 1 pm to 7 pm, all those on spot valuation duties will be present at the camp at around 1 pm, making it unsafe for them to attend these camps amid the Covid-19 threat.

The members of the Government Colleges Contract Lecturers Association, meanwhile, submitted a representation to the commissioner of intermediate education, Syed Omer Jaleel and requested him to take necessary precautionary measures to prevent the spread of coronavirus in these camps. They also asked him to provide accommodation to teachers as most of the hostels in the city and elsewhere in the state are closed.

Speaking to TOI, Jaleel said that he had already submitted a representation to the state on declaring holidays for spot valuation camps.

“Lecturers are scared to attend the spot valuation. As the decision to postpone spot valuation has to be taken by the state, we have sent a representation and are expecting a positive reply,” said Jaleel.

The Andhra Pradesh government on Friday declared holidays for spot valuation camps from March 21 to March 31.

PUNE: Nirbhaya’s family finally got to say on Friday that justice had been done with the execution of the four convicts, but the wait seems endless for the families of two other victims of gang-rape and murders in the city 13 and 11 years ago.

“The execution of Nirbhaya’s killers gives hope to families like ours, placed in similar situation and are fighting for justice,” said the brother-in-law of a 22-year-old BPO employee who was kidnapped, raped and murdered in November 2007 by Purushottam Borate , the driver of a regular cab contracted by her company, and his friend Pradeep Kokade .

The closest this victim’s family came to securing justice was when the trial court in Pune had issued a death warrant fixing Borate and Kokade’s hanging for June 24, 2019, but the duo got a reprieve from the Bombay high court (HC).

The HC commuted the death sentence of Borate and Kokade to life imprisonment, citing “inordinate” and “unexplained” delay in their execution. The state prison department’s petition against the HC’s order is since pending before the Supreme Court (SC).

All this, after the HC in September 2012 had confirmed death sentence for Borate and Kokade and the SC upholding the same in May 2015, following which the Maharashtra governor rejected the duo’s mercy petition in April 2016 and the President rejecting the same in May 2017.

“I commend the perseverance of Nirbhaya’s mother in taking the case to its logical end, and going by the whole experience, we feel the SC should stop entertaining any pleas that are aimed at delaying execution of death row convicts,” said the 2007 victim’s brother-in-law. “Otherwise, the convicts tend to exploit loopholes in the system, which must prove that it works,” he added.

The husband of a woman engineer with a software company in eastern Pune, abducted, gang-raped and murdered in October 2009, told TOI, “I am happy that the Nirbhaya killers have finally been hanged, but what about other cases. I want the killers of my wife to be hanged at the earliest.”

After seven years of protracted trial, a Pune court in May 2017 sentenced the three accused — Yogesh Raut , Mahesh Thakur and Vishwas Kadam — to death in the 2009 case. The confirmation of these sentences as well as the trio’s appeals are since pending a final hearing before the Bombay HC.

“We expect the final hearing to commence on April 15 and all events leading to the execution of Nirbhaya’s killers will definitely be relied on in support of our case,” said the victim’s husband.

“There are several such cases. The government must frame time-bound procedure for execution of the death row convicts from the time their death sentence is confirmed by the SC. Otherwise, the convicts get the benefit like the one witnessed in the 2007 BPO employee’s case,” he said.

Soon after he went missing, nearby districts were alerted and his location was tracked. A team under Sikar chief medical health officer De Ajay Chaudhary was formed which included Sikar district administration officials. They came to know that he had reached district hospital’s trauma centre.

He was roaming without a mask. “We immediately provided him mask and called an ambulance and sent him back to RUHS for quarantine under security,” said Dr Choudhary.

Bijnor: A Shia mosque in Amroha cancelled the Friday prayers while most other mosques in western UP witnessed a thin attendance of believers as the fear of novel coronavirus loomed large. It comes against the backdrop of similar moves by mosques in Kerala and Odisha.

Friday prayers usually witness a large gathering of Muslims. But, this Friday was different. In Muzaffarnagar, Baghpat and Bijnor, the clerics appealed to a bunch of devotees, who were present there, to take all the precautions. In Meerut, residents preferred to stay at home instead of going to the mosques. Churches have already cancelled Sunday prayers in UP and Uttarakhand.

In Amroha, a Shia mosque at Safatpota mohalla, cancelled the Friday prayer.

Mosque’s Imam, Mohammad Siyadat Naqvi, said, “We have cancelled Friday prayers in the wake of coronavirus breakout. Besides we have appealed to the devotees to maintain cleanliness and avoid joining the crowd. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has also urged people to stay away from crowded areas. We are following the guidelines given by the health department and government. If this situation persists for a long time, we will call off all community prayers. All devotees will offer namaz at home.”

Meanwhile, clerics of the Sunni sect have appealed to people to shun gathering. Prayers were offered after sanitizing the places of worship. “We should fight it together and follow advisories of health department,” a cleric said.

A Bijnor-based cleric told people, “There should be no gathering near the mosque after the prayers. Follow health department’s advisories.” In Baghpat, Maulana Aarif-ul Haq, said, “All devotees should maintain cleanliness and use masks. As far as possible they should maintain distance of one-metre from others.”

Meerut: Iconic Nauchandi fair of Meerut may not be held this time in a bid to contain the spread of novel coronavirus, a first such departure in its 1,000 years old history which withstood several events, including 1857 mutiny and post-Independence communal riots.

The importance of the fair could be gauged by the fact that the government named a train after it-- Nauchandi Express connecting Meerut with state capital Lucknow. Known to have started in 11th century, this annual fair never took a break.

“Even major events like 1857 mutiny and communal riots at the time of partition in 1947 could not stop this month-long fair that starts a fortnight after Holi every year. But this year, the circumstances might lead to its cancellation,” says Mufti Mohammad Ashraf, 63-year-old trustee of Hazrat Bale Mian dargah and 23rd generation descendant of Hazrat Bale Mian’s brother. Hazrat Bale Mian was a Sufi saint who was killed at a young age of 19 years. A shrine, Bale Miya Dargah, was built in his memory.

The saint was killed on new moon night, which means ‘naya chand' in Urdu. After that, a congregation began attending his death anniversary at the shrine which is adjacent to Meerut’s Nauchandi Ground. Later, it transformed into an annual fair.

The administration too is not keen on holding the fair this year. District magistrate (DM) of Meerut Anil Dhingra categorically denied holding the fair according to the plan.

Divisional commissioner of Meerut, Anita Meshram, said, “This time, the chances are slim as all the stalls in the fair come from Bulandshahr where a local fair culminates before moving to Meerut. And that fair has already been cancelled.”

An ancient temple, Chandi Devi Mandir, right in the front of Bale Mian’s shrine, symbolizes the Hindu-Muslim unity.

“The name, Nauchandi is actually named after Goddess Chandi and the fair takes place at the time of Navratras and hence the name Nauchandi,” claims temple priest Mahender Kumar Sharma. However, the shrine caretakers have a different take on that.

PUNE: Thousands of restaurants and all paan stalls in Pune district will remain closed till further orders, Pune district collector Naval Kishore Ram clarified on Thursday. Only takeaways and home deliveries from restaurants will be allowed, he said. In a relief to tipplers, liquor shops and beer shoppes will remain open, though the district authorities could review the decision later.

Not just restaurants and paan stalls, even video parlours and lottery centres will remain shut, Ram said. The clarification came a day after the district authorities banned the assembly of five or more people in public spaces as well as in private workplaces and private open spaces.

There are close to 3,000 big and small restaurants across the city and all will remain shut, the Pune Restaurants and Hoteliers Association (PRAHA) said.

On March 17, restaurants had decided to shut voluntarily for three days to ensure social distancing. They were to resume operations from Friday.

A senior official from the district administration told TOI on Thursday, “All restaurants, canteens and eating houses in the district will be closed till further notice. However, restaurants in hotels and lodges can provide food to in-house guests and to the canteens in students’ quarters. Messes can provide food to students in colleges or hostels who are appearing for their exams.”

PRAHA president Ganesh Shetty said, “The Pune divisional commissioner told us on Thursday that all restaurants in the district will stay closed till further notice. He said stock of the situation would be taken after seven days before any other decision is taken. The authorities have allowed takeaway and home delivery services to continue. However, we feel that only 5-10% restaurants would continue with such services as it may not be viable for them.”

Meanwhile, grocery-shop owners selling essential items like milk and bakery products alleged that they were forced by the police to down their shutters despite their trade not coming under the ambit of the ban.

Sachin Nivangune, president of the Pune District Retail Traders’ Association, said, “The police are patrolling many areas in the city and have been telling grocery and sweet shops selling milk and bakery items to shut, though the latest order states that essential groceries, dairy and dairy products, fruits and vegetables, dispensaries and other essential commodities are allowed to be sold. On Thursday, several grocery stores shut shop because of police pressure.”

A senior police official clarified, “The latest order clearly states that grocery stores, those supplying vegetables and milk, and medical stores will continue to operate.” He claimed that the shopkeepers’ allegations of police pressure was wrong.

NEW DELHI: “I don’t remember the last time we were happy,” said Nirbhaya’s mother , Asha Devi, seven years after her daughter was raped and brutalised in a moving bus. When Nirbhaya was alive, she never had a home that was spacious or equipped with an oven and geyser. Her family’s house in Dwarka now is. “Yet where’s the happiness?” her mother constantly asked.

On Friday, Devi was less diffident. It was a day when her long struggle resulted in the ultimate punishment for her daughter’s assaulters. “She got justice today. Through the day I have been looking at her photo and telling her she got justice,” Devi said.

And yet the hanging of the four of the six accused does not leave Devi entirely fulfilled. For she is still haunted by the last words of Nirbhaya. “My daughter was very strong but she was defeated and with her last strength, she asked me to get her justice,” Devi remembered.

People thronged the Dwarka house on Friday to congratulate the family. What remains to be done now that the men have been hanged? “I don’t plan to join politics. Instead I will never stop helping rape victims and their families,” Devi promised. “I will continue to put up a fight for all the daughters just as I did for my own daughter.”

It took Devi seven years to finally get some mental respite. Born and raised in a small village in eastern UP, she grew up on stories of violence and rape, but never imagined her own family would suffer the nightmare. When she married Badrinath Singh Pandey in 1985, she had dreams of a happy future as a family. The couple moved to Delhi, where Nirbhaya was born.

“Her father was so happy that he distributed sweets worth Rs 1,000 even when neighbours passed snide remarks about the birth of a girl,” the pugnacious mother recalled. “She was the brightest girl in her class and so we tried to give her the best education, hoping she would have a better life than us. And she always offered a helping hand to the needy.” And yet, Devi chokes, Nirbhaya’s life ended not in goodness but in pain.

Nirbhaya and her two siblings grew up in a two-room house in Dwarka’s Sector 8. This was the house she was returning to after watching her first English film, Life of Pi, at Select Citywalk Mall in south Delhi’s Saket with a friend on December 16, 2012, when the horrific incident took place. Now the family lives a few kilometres away.

One of Nirbhaya's brothers is now a pilot based in Bengaluru. He was counselled by Rahul Gandhi after his sister’s death and was later sent to Indira Gandhi Rashtriya Udan Akademi in Rae Bareli for training. Devi shies from talking about the other son.

The family didn’t know an iota about the litigation process and was shocked to find the convicts could take resort to so many legal remedies. “One delay after another left us increasingly distraught,” the mother mumbled. “But I kept faith that the convicts would eventually be hanged.”

She is grateful for how people stood solidly behind the family. “When Nirbhaya was in the hospital, I didn’t realise how the people were reacting outside. But a day before we left for Singapore for her treatment, a doctor took me outside to see the hundreds who had gathered in our support. I was touched,” she smiled wanly. “Since then, my husband and I have not attended a single social function. Our lives were limited to home and courts.”

Devi acknowledges the role of the protesters, who did not budge even when subjected to police action but expressed disappointment that though the case became a national cause celebre, it went on interminably. She was startled when, after the first date of hanging was announced for January 22, many began championing the rights of the rapists. “Who were these people who wanted rights for men who raped my daughter and intentionally pulled out her intestines?” she asked bitterly.

(The victim's identity has not been revealed to protect her privacy as per Supreme court directives on cases related to sexual assault)

They have been tasked to ensure any resident coming from abroad is reported to the state government and stays in home quarantine. The committees are meeting daily at 8pm to discuss the developments.“We have a large influx of people who frequently travel abroad.

We are reporting to the chief minister’s office if anyone is not co-operating,” said Sanjiv Ganeriwal, president of Urbana Welfare Association.The complex has stopped all sorts of interior decoration and renovation works to limit entry of outsiders. The association has also made videos — on dos and don’ts and on personal hygiene advisory — and is sharing them on WhatsApp groups.At Silver Spring off EM Bypass, the resident association isn’t allowing any delivery personnel inside the complex and has been asking residents to either come to the reception and pick the order by himself or to collect it later from the security personnel.

NEW DELHI: The Nirbhaya case convicts – Mukesh Singh , Vinay Sharma , Akshay Thakur and Pawan Gupta – had a sleepless night. When the clock struck 3.30am on Friday, they were taken out of their solitary cells in jail number 3 to be prepared for execution.

The quartet kept asking whether a new order had been passed by any court across the country. Through the night, Gupta kept asking for forgiveness from the jailers pleading to let him go, while Singh withdrew into himself.

On Thursday night, Singh and Sharma had rice, dal and vegetables for dinner, while Thakur had a cup of tea. They were offered breakfast, but they refused. They didn’t take a bath and refused to wear the clothes given by the jail authorities.

Around 4.30am, district magistrate Neha Bansal read them the order to execute the death sentence. She met them individually to ask for their last wish. Sources said Gupta and Thakur didn’t say anything, while Singh gave a written note to the DM asking to donate his organs. Sharma requested that his ‘paintings’ be given to the jail superintendent and his copy of Hanuman Chalisa and an image of God to his parents.

A medical examination was conducted during which the jail doctors measured their weight and checked their vitals to declare them fit for hanging. In the meanwhile, the hangman, Pawan Jallad, prepared the nooses made with manila ropes and softened with bananas and butter.

After the DM’s visit, the convicts were allowed to remain alone for some time to remember their family and loved ones. Jail officials then went to their cells and asked them to wear white cotton clothes. This time, Sharma broke down and pleaded with the jail officials to let him go. He refused to wear the clothes. Singh, Gupta and Thakur asked the officials to allow them to meet Sharma, but their request was rejected.

A team of jail officials, including the superintendent, deputy superintendent, wardens and Tamil Nadu special police officers, helped the convicts wear the clothes and then each of them were escorted by six security personnel to the hanging well.

Sources said Sharma refused to accompany the jail staffers and lay down outside his cell. He had to be carried by the wardens into the well. Before entering the well, their faces were covered with a black cloth so that they didn’t get a glimpse of the gallows.

The jail authorities had requisitioned for armed guards from Delhi Police to be present near the gallows. The condemned men were walked to the platform where the hangman placed the noose around their neck. The men kept resisting till the noose was tightened.

At 5.30am, the superintendent signalled the hangman to pull the two levers holding the plate under their feet. The four men were suspended into the pit and became still after squirming for a short while, jail sources said. They were left in the position till 6am after which a doctor entered the well to confirm that they had died.

The bodies were removed and kept in the jail premises. Around 8am, the bodies were taken in four separate ambulances for autopsy at DDU Hospital. The family members were allowed to take the bodies after they gave a declaration that they would not hold protest marches. While the hangings were going on, the other prisoners at Tihar Jail were under lockdown. Instead of the usual time of 6.30am, they were allowed to start their daily routine half an hour late.

The worst–affected are daily wagers and street vendors Every day, groups of labours from rural areas can be seen waiting at the major crossings of the city from morning to late afternoon in the hope of getting some work. The condition of the street vendors is no different. Their business has dipped by over 60% over the past one week.With demand shrinking, hundreds of daily wagers working at dhabas, cafes, restaurants, showrooms and factories have been sent on unpaid leave.A group of five construction workers from Bichpuri block at Bodla crossing here told TOI that they have not been able to get any work for the last three days. They said if they did not get any work for another week, they would have to borrow money from loan sharks to sustain their families.Shahganj-based shoe factory worker Imran, who got married in January, said, “I am a daily wager. I spent my entre savings of Rs 25,000 for my marriage. Since March 15, I have been on unpaid leave. I don’t know when I will get back to work. I have asked my wife to try and take work as a domestic help. Coronavirus has made the situation very difficult for us. I hope that this bad phase ends soon.”Idgha resident Virendra Singh, a waiter in a restaurant at Bhagwan Talkies was asked not to come to work from Tuesday. “I used to be paid Rs 200 a day as wages and Rs 100 as tip from costumers. Due to a significant fall in the number of costumers since March 10, the restaurant owner asked me to come after two weeks. I tried but could not find any alternative work. I have decided to work without pay so that I can at least get a tip from the customers,” he said.A kachori and samosa seller near Kheria crossing said, “In February, I was making a net profit of at least Rs 700 a day. Now, my earnings have fallen by 60%. I have three school-going children, a wife and mother to look after. I don’t know how I will be able to manage the family expenses if the current situation continues for a few more days.”Talking with TOI, district president of Bharatiya Mazdoor Sangh Bhupendra Rana said, “The labours and people working in the unorganized sector are facing a financial crisis.

The function was attended by BJP MP Sakshi Maharaj along with Farrukhabad MP Mukesh Rajput and BJP MLA Vipin Kumar Lodhi from Etah city. Surprisingly, while several states across the country have banned gatherings of more than 50 people, Mathura’s administration had given permission for the function.

Interacting with media, MP Sakshi Maharaj claimed that “this” was not a large gathering and there was not much crowd at the function. He said, however, the PM has allowed movement of public representatives and people working in medical sector during this period. “Primarily, curfew is on March 22 and we will follow it,” said the MP.

When contacted, city magistrate, Manoj Kumar Singh, said he did not remember that he had issued any such permission. However, no permission of any function is being given at present in view of special circumstances, he said.

Meanwhile, Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) has made changes in their programme amid coronavirus scare. Instead of organising large gatherings of 10,000 to 50,000 each in three lakh villages across the country during Ram Mahotsav, they have now planned to reduce it to small gatherings approved legally by health authorities. VHP’s international joint general secretary SK Jain told TOI that after the PM’s appeal, they will follow all steps in view of public health.

However, traders in Hazratganj and parts of Old city, who did not fall in the purview of closure also downed shutters in view of coronavirus threat.Police carried out pratrolling in many areas to ensure compliance of orders.At a prominent medicine shop in Indiranagar, customers bought medicine for a month and purchased masks and sanitisers in bulk.“I know that medicine stores will remain open but I am buying more than required because no one knows when the situation gets worse forcing closure of vegetable and medicine shops as well,” said Sushil Srivastava of Indiranagar.“The situation is uncertain and I don’t want to take chances. I am buying everything required to last at least 15 days,” said Shipra Bajpayee of Kapoorthala.

311,['21/03/2020'],Private doctors urge admin to make PPEs available in Nashik,"NASHIK: Private doctors have asked the district administration to make personal protection equipment (PPE) available at the earliest as it is not available in the market.

Office-bearers of the Indian Medical Association (IMA), Nashik, said, they had brought it to the notice of the administration that there was a shortage of the PPEs in the market.

IMA Nashik president Prashant Deore said, “Doctors are rendering their services in the city and the district. However, in a bid to avoid rush at the hospital or clinics, we have appealed to people to visit hospitals only when it is extremely urgent.”

Deore said that crowding at the hospitals or clinics would put both, the patients and the doctors, at the risk of getting infected. If a doctor gets infected, he or she could end up passing on the infection to other patients. “Hence, doctors are on the lookout of the PPEs but these equipment are not available in the market,” he said.

Meanwhile, district officials said they were negotiating with the suppliers over the price of the PPEs. Government has prefixed rate of buying things. However, if the articles are not available in the range pre-decided by the government, it becomes difficult to procure them.

Senior officials said that private doctors have a good rapport with pharmacists and they can make use of it to procure the PPEs from these pharmacists.

Assistant district collector Kumar Ashirwad, who is part of the team taking measures for purchasing articles and equipment to treat treatment Covid 19 patients, said, “We are in the process of procuring the PPEs at the earliest. IMA has brought the issue to our notice and we are committed to solve it at the earliest,” he said.

IMA Nashik office-bearers claimed that all their members were rendering services to the ailing patients. However, the district administration and the Nashik Municipal Corporation had come out with a notice against private practitioners if they kept their hospitals and clinics closed. Over the past few days, the PHCs in the rural areas and the city were witnessing huge rush on account of non-availability of private doctors.

312,['21/03/2020'],‘Tourism business in U’khand to take a massive hit if Covid-19 scare continues’,"Dehradun/Mussoorie/Pithoragarh/Uttarkashi/Nainital: The coronavirus outbreak and the restrictions put in place by the government to contain it by prohibiting entry of tourists — both foreign and domestic — into the state is all set to hit Uttarakhand hard as the state is primarily a tourism-oriented state. While welcoming the decision of state government to ban entry of tourists to stem the spread of infection, tourism industry stakeholders in most major destinations like Mussoorie, Nainital, Uttarkashi and Pithoragarh — said that they were gearing up for huge financial losses.

Ajay Bhargava, vice-president of Mussoorie Hotels Association, told TOI that “although tourist arrival would come to a standstill, the hoteliers would continue to incur expenditure on staff salaries, electricity and water bills and other overheads.” “It can break our backs. We see difficult times ahead,” he added.

Not just hoteliers, other stakeholders in the tourism industry like tour and taxi operators as well as shopkeepers, too, expressed concern on the financial implications of an extended lockdown.

“There are close to 1000 shops in Mussoorie and most of them are dependent upon tourism. Revenues of shopkeepers have dwindled drastically over the past fortnight and now a ban on entry of tourists would result in near zero revenues for us,” said Rajat Aggarwal, president of Mussoorie Traders Association.

While acknowledging that the tourism industry would be hit, state tourism minister Satpal Maharaj told TOI that “coronavirus is not just a regional or national issue but a global one and our priority is to save lives and ensure healthcare facilities are not stretched.” “Tourism revenue is not our focus at present,” he added.

Meanwhile, on Friday, soon after the state government banned entry of tourists in the state, the Nainital district administration announced to suspend boating and other adventure activities like paragliding and horse-riding in and around the lake town till March 31.

All hotels have already been shut down in the town. “Almost all bookings have been cancelled and there is hardly any business prospect for the next month,” said Diwan Rautela, owner of a travel company.

While tourism professionals geared for loss in revenue and possible layoff of staff, some were hopeful that the situation will improve by the time the Char Dham Yatra season began in April. “We are hoping that the threat of this fatal virus will subside before the Char Dham Yatra begins in April. Tourists mainly visit in large numbers in the summer months. However, if the Covid-19 scare spills over and persists even till next month, then we will have a big problem at hand,” said Suresh Singh Negi, a hospitality professional in Rudraprayag.

Both the hair dresser and the student have tested positive for Covid-19.While Kerala and Karnataka advertised modes of transport and routes thorough press releases and social media along with a flow chart on patient’s movements when he or she was symptomatic, Tamil Nadu health department has kept details under wraps. “We will not miss a single person. We have shared names of contacts with other states as well. If we cannot reach them we will look at other ways,” health minister C Vijaya Baskar told reporters. “All contacts including family, friends, neighbours, colleagues are advised home quarantine even though we don’t know the source of infection,” he said.The public health department has been directed to contact and counsel all co-passengers to remain on home quarantine. Southern Railway has handed over names and contact of 163 others who travelled with him in the two coaches of Delhi Chennai Tamil Nadu Express that reached Chennai on March 12. All these passengers are considered “low-risk” contacts. “They will also be asked to stay in home quarantine. “They have to report to the health officials on call if they have symptoms of Covid-19.

In addition, the state has also advised 39 residents of Arumbakkam area who came in contact with 20-year-old hair dresser to stay in home quarantine.The international carrier has handed over passenger details to the health department.

This will help us contain the virus,” said health secretary Beela Rajesh. “We are hearing complaints about how passengers under quarantine are being stigmatised by neighbours. One woman was asked to vacate her house. Releasing the area of residence or places where they have visited may worsen the situation,” she said.On Friday health officials said after they urged relatives of the student from Ireland to quarantine themselves; sanitary staff also disinfected the area. “We did this for safety but this was enough to trigger panic.

314,['21/03/2020'],Covid-19 scare in Tamil Nadu: Social welfare department to send aid to the elderly,"Representative image

CHENNAI: As part of efforts to check Covid-19, the department of social welfare is roping in women’s self-help groups to take care of the elderly and the disabled, many of whom are stuck at home with no one to help them with their daily chores.

The self-help groups will make home visits to assist the aged and the infirm with their daily activities, provide them masks, hand sanitisers, and required medicines. They will also stay in constant touch with senior citizens through phones, e-mails, and social media.

Social welfare officials said they were coming across cases across the state where senior citizens were struggling to go out and run errands because they were getting anxious about contracting the virus. “Many of them live alone, and have locked themselves in their homes to avoid the virus. This will impact their overall health,” said a senior official.

The self-help groups will be assisted by men and women from the local community, medical officers, nurses, psychologists and social workers. The teams will cover all neighbourhoods in the state and coordinate with local authorities and primary health centres to make a list of senior citizens and people with disabilities who need help. They will also cover people from economically weaker sections.

Dr. Lakshmipathy Ramesh, senior consultant in geriatrics at Kauvery Hospital, said the elderly were especially vulnerable. “Once you reach 60 years of age the immune system weakens. Those who are under medication for diabetes or cancer are more vulnerable to the virus,” he said, adding “Senior citizens, in general, should not visit doctors or clinics, telephonic consultations or home visits are ideal.”

“The ideal way would be to set up helplines exclusively for senior citizens where they can seek help or consultation,” said D. Rajasekaran, general secretary of the Tamil Nadu senior citizens organisation.

V. Sivakumar, director Helpage India (Tamil Nadu), lauded the state’s initiative but at the same time warned them to be careful as “even mere visits to their home would stigmatise them. But at the same time, a home visit is a good idea.” Since the outbreak, Helpage has been receiving calls from anxious senior citizens. “Many of them are living alone, their children are abroad. Some don’t have money to seek help. Loneliness can be detrimental to their health,” he said.

Dr. Lashmipathy said having families nearby can boost the morale of senior citizens.

He was traced later to his home in Anantpur, Andhra Pradesh , and was sent back to Bengaluru after much convincing.“They take time to understand that they need to be quarantined even if they do not have symptoms. Their heath is assessed at the airport and they are sent directly to a hospital from there. They are mostly people above 55 years with high BP, hypertension or diabetes. We have to watch their health. A dietician and a doctor looks after them in public quarantine,” Dr Ramesh Krishna R , medical superintendent, Sir CV Raman General Hospital, said.Two medical college hospitals in Bengaluru have also set up public quarantine facilities for asymptomatic travellers.

Food supplied to inmates is based on dietary specifications of the hospital.Following demands for food from outside — which was initially banned — authorities relented and began providing food from outside at government expense. Many of them are also being provided diabetic medicines.“They are NRIs, who are probably entering a government hospital or a public health facility for the first time.

CHENNAI: The scare surrounding coronavirus has hit the rescue of homeless people in the city and night shelters are no longer admitting them. Shelter coordinators said they want to avoid overcrowding and cannot take in any new homeless person as it may risk the safety and health of existing inmates.

“We are now wary of people, especially those coming from North Chennai because many people there often travel to the northern parts of the country. We don’t know what infection they might carry,” said D Jagadeesh, coordinator at a men’s shelter in Thiruvottiyur. The shelter has the capacity to accommodate 50 but it currently has around 24 inmates. “We have to ensure that these people are safe and we cannot take any risk,” he said.

To prevent the spread of Covid-19, all the 50 shelters are taking precautionary measures, such as insisting on washing hands, using sanitisers and masks, and avoiding crowding.

“We admitted five new people last week because the police referred them to us. But now we have stopped,” said K Palani, coordinator of a shelter for elderly men and women run by ICWO in Pattalam.

“But what about us? Aren’t we equally vulnerable to contract the virus?” asked D Rajalakshmi, a daily wager who with her two children and mother lives on a pavement in Choolai. Rajalakshmi said she was turned away from the Thiruvottiyur shelter and another shelter near Kelly’s citing lack of space. “They asked us to contact a corporation official, get tested and find another place,” she said.

R Arunachalam, another daily wager and pavement dweller at Besant Nagar, said, “The police do not want us on the streets and said we would get the virus. But the shelters are turning us away. What are we supposed to do?” he asked.

“Unless they are referred by a corporation official and screened at a public health centre, we cannot allow them in. We have to take care of our people here,” said A Sophia from a women’s shelter on Ibrahim Street.

Alby John Varghese, deputy commissioner (health), Greater Chennai Corporation, said though they have temporarily stopped conducting rescue operations, every homeless person who comes to the shelter individually for help will be admitted. “Nobody can be denied admission. We are also looking at other alternatives to keep them safe during this time.”

“The ‘stay at home’ advice sadly doesn’t work for the homeless,” said Vanessa Peter, a policy researcher at the Information and Resource Centre for the Deprived Urban Communities. She urged officials to open more shelters or at least accommodate them at community halls.

Prices of most vegetables have almost doubled in the retail market within 24 hours.

Veggies that had been selling for Rs 20-30 per kg till Thursday afternoon suddenly started selling at Rs 50-60 per kg across the city with vegetable vendors forming organised cartels to loot buyers, many lament. People had already started stocking up on essential commodities fearing a situation like in several western countries after these went on a lockdown mode.

Surtis thronged vegetable markets late on Thursday night after the news of the first positive coronavirus case spread like wildfire in the city. Cashing in on the rush, vegetable vendors charged whatever prices they wanted on the rising demand for greens.

Nalini Rawal, a housewife from Adajan said, “Vendors are taking benefit of the prevailing chaotic situation by increasing prices. People are scared and have no choice but to purchase vegetables at any cost.”

The prices of brinjal increased from Rs 30 per kg to Rs 65 per kg, tomato to Rs 35 per kg instead of the regular Rs20, beans jumped to Rs 65 per kg from Rs35 a kilo, lady finger selling at double the price at Rs 50 a kg among many other vegetables.

The Agriculture Produce Market Committee (APMC) has, however, registered about 30% increase in supply of vegetables in the market yard as the farmers in Maharashtra have started diverting their excess produce in the city following the lockdown announced in four cities of Maharashtra on Friday.

Secretary of APMC, Nilesh Thorat said, “The wholesale prices of vegetables are unchanged from the last many days. In fact, the APMC is flooded with excess supplies of vegetables, especially from Maharashtra, as farmers are diverting their produce in Surat, Navsari and Valsad due to the worsening situation of coronavirus epidemic in Maharashtra”

Thorat added, “At present, the supply of vegetables including potato, tomato and onion has increased 30% from the normal days. There is no shortage of vegetables. Even if the retail vendors are increasing the prices, it is uncalled for.”

“The prices have been increased by our suppliers. However, we are bound to increase the prices keep our profit margin for the retail customers. It is not that we are trying to gain benefit out of the prevailing situation in the city” said Rajesh Patel, a vegetable vendor at Palanpur Patia vegetable market.

324,['21/03/2020'],Kochi reels under rise in temperature,"Kochi: Summer has not even set in. But the city has been witnessing a rise in temperature from February. Most of the days record and average temperature between 35 to 38 degrees Celsius. Humidity levels are also above 70 percentage.

According to the Kerala state disaster management authority (KSDMA), one of the reasons that Kochi gets high temperatures despite being a coastal area is because of the high-end construction activities across the year. KSDMA, in its state heat action plan, has indicated that tarring and interlocked tiles reflect heat. With humidity levels so high, a 33 to 34 degrees temperature could feel like 36-37 degrees. It increases fatigue and exhaustion levels in people.

The draft heat plan also says that this forms urban heat islands where certain areas feel much hotter than others.

“The urban heat islands is a phenomenon which is of concern for cities. Also, one cannot deny that global warming is becoming a reality. The variation in wind movement also impact temperatures,” said Cusat ST-Radar facility joint director S Abhilash.

If one were to look at the temperatures recorded in the Cochin International Airport Ltd and Navy airport, there is a three-degree variation. “The coastal winds keep circulating and the cool winds that come into the land regulates the temperature after 11am. Coastal regions are cooler because of the cool sea wind,” said senior atmospheric scientist C K Rajan. He said that the number of trees that have been cut down over the past decade is a case in point that we are opting for more desertification than greening. “We have already levelled our wetlands and waterbodies. These factors have led to changes in weather systems. Multi-stored buildings reflect heat back to the land,” Rajan said.

KSDMA has asked people to avoid exposure to direct sunlight and use sunscreen creams to prevent sunburns.

They will be closed till April 15. “We discussed the issue of shutting down the retiring rooms because a lot of passengers use them. Despite sanitising them, it is hard to make sure that they do not pose a risk to the passengers and others,” said a senior SCR official. He said the decision was meant to help minimise travel-related risks.Meanwhile, the decision has not gone down well with passengers. “We do not have proper information as to which trains are running and which trains are cancelled. It would have been better if we had a safe and sanitised space in railway stations to sit and wait,” said V Surraiyah, a resident of Begumpet, who is travelling to Kanpur on March 22.Officials, however, said rush of passengers at the dormitories and retiring rooms is high and that safety of passengers cannot be compromised. All old and fresh bookings for allotment of retiring rooms and dormitories immediately were cancelled.Meanwhile, SCR has taken up painting and sticking floor markings at passenger reservation system offices, general ticket booking offices and counters, automatic ticket vending machines and parcel offices at major railway stations which handle heavy footfalls.“The step will go a long way in streamlining queue management at service utilities in busy railway stations in the zone. The brightly coloured floor marking strips will ensure segregation of waiting passengers in a queue by encouraging them to maintain a distance of one metre from each other while they wait to complete transactions,” an official release of SCR said.Railway Protection Force personnel and railway staff have been assigned the task of educating and persuading passengers to follow the social distancing drill.",hyderabad,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74740843,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-613719,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/scr-shuts-retiring-room-dorms-in-all-rly-stations/articleshow/74740138.cms

Eight others who sustained severe burn injuries have been admitted to government hospitals in Tuticorin, Tirunelveli and Kovilpatti. As many as 30 employees were working at the cracker unit which had a licence from the district revenue officer (DRO) when the incident happened.

Rani, 42, Jayabarathi, 45, Badrakali, 33, Veerathai, 34, Thamaraiselvi , 32, and Thangammal, 39, died on the spot. Another person, Murugaiah, 55, died at the hospital. Later, an unidentified woman employee was also found dead at the spot.

Though manufacturing of fancy crackers is not permitted in a DRO-licensed unit, the employees were understood to have been making such crackers illegally. They were handling chemicals for this purpose in a working shed when the blast was triggered. The fire from the shed engulfed and brought down nearly 12 other working sheds inside the cracker unit. Fire and rescue services personnel put out the fire after struggling for nearly two hours.

Virudhunagar superintendent of police P Perumal visited the spot and conducted an inquiry. Elayirampannai police have registered a case and are conducting investigations. Virudhunagar district collector R Kannan visited the employees undergoing treatment at the Kovilpatti government hospital. Kannan later told mediapersons that as the summer season has commenced, the employees should follow all safety norms during manufacture.

He said if officials found any violation in the variety of crackers permitted, the licence of the unit would be suspended. Steps would also be taken to award compensation to the family of the deceased employees, he added.

The order has come into effect from March 20 and all the departments and sections have issued rosters for the same.

An official at the secretariat said, “Now, since the government and all departments are focused on combating the spread of virus in the state, other departmental works have taken a back seat. Now, even as 50% employees have been asked to work from home, if there is an urgent matter the official concerned would be called to office.”

“It will definitely impact daily works of the departments, but now the priority is to combat the spread of virus. Most of the departmental meetings have been postponed till further orders,” the official added.

In panchayati raj and rural development department, the officials who come from far-off places and use public transport for commuting, have been asked not to come to office. “We have asked them to work from home. If necessary, we will call them to office.”

Meanwhile, social justice and empowerment department has announced closure of all residential schools and hostels running under the department.

Essential services and departments exempted from the shutdown include medical and health, medical education, ayurveda, energy, discoms, PHED, local self-government, municipal bodies, home and police, jail, FSL, finance, food and civil supplies.

Other busy interchange stations, such as Rajiv Chowk and Central Secretariat, also saw much fewer commuters. Activity was only seen when people exited the trains to switch over to another line.Inside the trains, there was hardly any space for a person to “socially distance” himself or herself with all seats being occupied. Commuters were seen standing as usual. No metro official was present on the platform or inside the trains to enforce the new rules.At Lajpat Nagar, which acts as an interchange station for Violet and Pink Lines, a similar situation was seen. A CISF official stationed at the X-ray baggage inspection machine said there had been a slight drop in footfall on Friday compared with the last couple of days. “It could be due to the DMRC announcement, or simply because people are trying to avoid travelling by the metro,” he added.Contrary to DMRC’s claims of not allowing people with cough and cold in the trains, many such commuters were seen. The frequency of disinfection and cleaning at stations was visibly increased, but so had confusion and disarray. A commuter, Mohit Bhatia, asked, “What do they mean by metro may not stop at crowded stations? This creates a lot of confusion.”Anuj Dayal, executive director (corporate communications), DMRC, said, “Delhi Metro is making all necessary efforts to implement the new guidelines. They are being gradually brought into effect. All individuals must come together to fight the pandemic and prevent it from spreading any further.”“Passengers have already reduced with about 37 lakh journeys performed on Thursday compared with the general weekday average of 55-60 lakh.

For 10.15am, the train was empty, but as commuters ahead of him entered, the compartment got a little crowded. After hesitating for a few seconds, Kumar let it go.“This is nothing compared to the usual morning rush, but I don’t want to take a chance. Despite the mask, I’m scared of getting infected by novel coronavirus,” he said.But why isn’t he staying at home? “I work for a construction company and have to work at the site. Staying at home means going without pay and I can’t afford that,” Kumar explained.Delhi Metro has been witnessing a gradual decline in the daily footfall over the last two weeks and a dip on Friday, a day after it announced strong measures to control crowding. But there are still lakhs who don’t have an alternative.Sameer Kushwaha is one of them. “I work for a small firm and work from home is not possible for us, particularly around the March closing.

KOTA: A 24-year-old married woman and daughter of Congress MLA from Madhya Pradesh Suresh Dhakad allegedly committed suicide by hanging from the ceiling in her husband’s house at a village in Baran district on the intervening night of Thursday and Friday.

On the report by brother of the deceased woman, the police lodged a case of dowry death under sections of IPC against her husband, mother-in-law, elder brother-in-law and sister-in-law.

The deceased was daughter of rebel Congress MLA from Pohari area in MP , Suresh Dhakad, who recently sided with BJP amid political turmoil surrounding the Kamal Nath government. Early in the day, Dhakad was expected to reach Baran for the autopsy but instead of him, his son reached Baran following which autopsy was conducted by a medical board.

The deceased has been identified as Jyoti, wife of Dr Jai Singh Mehta, a resident of Baskheda village under Kelwada police station of Baran.

The body with marks of hanging around the neck was recovered lying on the floor at her house, SHO (Kelwada police station) Nand Singh told TOI.

Singh said, in the report to police, deceased woman’s brother alleged that her husband, mother-in-law, brother-in-law and sister-in-law of torturing, thrashing and harassing his sister for dowry since after his sister had given birth to a girl child two years ago. On the report, police lodged a case of dowry death against husband Dr. Jai Singh Mehta, and three other in laws under Section 304 B and 34 of IPC and initiated investigation into the matter, he added.

Singh said, the deceased woman was married three years ago to Dr Jai Singh Mehta, who is posted as medical officer at Shahabad health centre and lives in Baskheda village. The investigation into the death was yet to be initiated as nobody in the in-laws’ family of the deceased was currently ready to speak in the matter. The deceased woman is survived by a two-year-old daughter, he said.

342,['21/03/2020'],Nirbhaya case: Police team that beat odds to bring perpetrators to justice recalls efforts,"The special investigation team’s efforts culminated into the hangings on Friday

NEW DELHI: From identifying the culprits to arresting them and filing a watertight chargesheet, police had their task cut out in the horrific Nirbhaya gang rape case.

The best minds of Delhi Police were brought together in the special investigation team (SIT). Veteran investigators like PS Kushwaha and Rajender Singh and extremely supportive supervisors Dharmendra Kumar and Chhaya Sharma worked day and night under the then police commissioner Neeraj Kumar to make a case that made acquittal an impossible task.

Speaking to TOI, Neeraj Kumar said, “It is a great satisfaction for us as police officers that the job we did was lauded by the court of law. It set a benchmark for the future too.”

The case had many firsts — from using Nirbhaya’s hand movements and gestures as dying declaration to identification of culprits and forensic odontology (using teeth/bite mark) to prove culpability.

This was also perhaps the first time in history that Delhi cops worked under extraordinary pressure. From the early hours of December 17, 2012 to January 3, 2013, a group of policemen from south Delhi could sleep only for a few hours at a stretch.

“All of us were under tremendous pressure from the public, media and the government. Despite this, we were able to arrest all the culprits and file a chargesheet in record time,” said Dharmender Kumar, the then special commissioner (law and order).

Kushwaha, who was the SIT chief, was emotional after the verdict. “The finality of the judicial process will act as a deterrence and will help prevent repeat of crime of this severity,” he added.

Rajender Singh, who was then an inspector with the SIT, recalled the first few days as the most memorable. “We had a mammoth task at hand. After catching the accused, it was a challenge to gather enough evidence and keep them safe. There was a crowd outside the police station through the day waiting to break in and punish the accused. We would pose as civilians and use the back gates to take them in and out for production in court. I still remember DCP Sharma locking herself with the team for three days monitoring the situation real-time,” he said.

Singh said the day they filed the chargesheet, they stopped at India Gate to have ice-cream. “This memory will be with me forever,” he added.

Feeling totally humbled on Friday, Sharma said, “I feel all the challenges and problems were worth taking on. For me and my team, it’s a moment when not only our faith in the judicial system, but also that of victims who look at us expectantly for justice, all stands vindicated. My team and I had the strong belief that justice would be delivered if we followed due process of law.”

NASHIK: Commercial establishments like wedding lawns, shops and even paan stalls are facing the heat for not adhering to the closure order in the district.

With the spread of Covid-19 all across the country, the district administration has brought into effect the Disaster Management Act and Epidemic Prevention Act. Under this, wedding halls have been banned from March 19 to March 31. At the same time, anything that would attract more people like sale of garments, were also banned. Even the pan stalls were stopped from Thursday.

Eighteen such establishments were booked on Thursday under section 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant) of the Indian Penal Code.

The Adgaon police took action against four wedding hall owners and managers for renting their premises for wedding ceremonies on Thursday. The Panchavati police took action against two such wedding halls and lawns.

The Upnagar police took action against three pan stalls, while the Nashik Road police took action against five pan stall owners for operating. The Panchavati police too took action against four garment shops along Makhmalabad Road and in Adgaon Naka.

Commissioner of police Vishwas Nangare-Patil said, “We are taking action against all the establishments that are flouting the orders issued under the Epidemic Prevention Act. Teams have been formed at the police station level to check if wedding halls are still operating. At the same time, action is also being taken against pan stalls owners as well as those found spitting on the road. The aim is do away with gathering of people. The police are doing video recording of the crowd and taking appropriate action.”

Nangare-Patil said that orders have been issued to all the police stations to conduct medical check-up of suspects, who are arrested or detained for interrogation.

Police officials said the cyber police station is maintaining a strict vigil on people spreading rumours through social media. Further, notices have also been issued to 256 establishments to follow the prohibition orders.

Five teams have been prepared to help the drug inspectors of the Food and Drugs Administration to take action against people selling masks and sanitizers at increased prices or storing them illegally. Further, this team comprising four ACPs, six PSIs and 25 personnel would also keep a check if there is any kind of adulteration in the sanitizers.

Nangare-Patil said they have taken the list of quarantine places identified by the Nashik civil hospital in the city. “We have decided to put up Quick Response (QR) codes a these places for the patrolling teams to scan them around the clock. Patrolling teams can keep a check on the people, who have been quarantined, and ensure that they do not escape,” he said.

Three people booked for spreading false message on social media

346,['21/03/2020'],Delhi: Cheers at dawn outside prison,"People eating sweets outside Tihar Jail in Delhi during Nirbhaya case convicts' hanging

NEW DELHI: Tihar Central Jail is usually devoid of excitement most mornings. But the facility in west Delhi was abuzz with activity before sunrise on Friday. People from all walks of life, of all ages, congregated there to witness what they called ‘a historic moment’. When the news reached the crowd that the brutal rapists of Nirbhaya were dead, everyone clapped and shouted exultantly while passing on sweets.

Slogans of “Asha Devi zindabad” rent the air, both in solidarity with the mother of Nirbhaya and in admiration for her never-say-die spirit through the seven harsh years. In the crowd were media people with their tripods and cameras, especially at Gate 3.

The people started a countdown to 5.30am, the time appointed for the hanging of Mukesh Singh, Akshay Thakur, Vinay Sharma and Pawan Gupta. Awaiting the hour, they chanted “Bharat mata ki jai” and “Vande Mataram”, taking the event as an assertion of national good over evil. In between, one could hear “AP Singh murdabad”, the lawyer of the four death row convicts being demonised for legal shenanigans that caused numerous postponements of the hanging.

At Gate 3 was nine-year-old Janisha. Her father, Simranjeet Singh, said, “I share everything with my daughter. In schools these days, children are educated about good and bad touches. I thought if I told my daughter about what was happening here today, it would make an impression on her.”

Dwarka resident Dolly reached Tihar around 5am with her husband and sexagenarian parents. “We got up early to come here because we support Nirbhaya and it is after years that justice is being delivered,” the woman said. “We women still don’t feel safe, but today’s hanging is a confidence-building step for us.”

Dolly’s husband, Rakesh Malik, a commercial pilot, interjected, “I feel decisions in all pending cases related to crimes against women should be speeded up and people should be hanged for committing such crimes. However, I also feel that we need to make changes in the laws to make them stricter. Even in this case, the juvenile accused got off lightly despite his heinous crime.”

Much after the four men were executed, commuters stopped on the road to enquire from the crowd, “Ho gayi phansi?” They received happy responses. “Yes,” the smiling people told them. The drivers smiled in return, said “Good” and drove away. On the other side of the road, representatives of an NGO gathered. They held aloft the tricolour and brightly announced they were celebrating March 20 as Nirbhaya Day.

(The victim's identity has not been revealed to protect her privacy as per Supreme court directives on cases related to sexual assault)

Barring shops selling essential commodities, all establishments will remain shut till March 23. Banks in trans-Gomti area will also remained closed on Saturday as part of the lockdown.

The areas locked down include Mahanagar, Vikasnagar, Indiranagar and Aliganj. Hospitals, pathology laboratories, chemist shops, petrol pumps, grocery stores, dairy products sellars and LPG agencies will remain open but all officies, shops, institutes and commercial units in these area will remain shut.

District magistrate Abhishek Prakash said the lockdown has been ordered in the 3km radius of localities from where Covid-19 positive cases have emerged.

“Such closure is a must to break the chain of virus spread. Until now, most persons who tested positive in the city had travel history, which means they had ‘imported’ infection. But on Friday, three persons who tested positive got infected after coming in contact with the Covid-19 patient. Such cases are known as ‘local transmission’. Now, there is a threat that that local transmission cases may spread the infection further. By reducing gatherings, we can break the chain reaction,” the DM said.

DM said police and district officials will patrol the areas and those violating the order will be booked under IPC Section 188 (disobedience of government officer) which prescribes a month’s imprisonment and Rs 1,000 fine.

The administration has also ordered closure of malls, restaurants, bars, cafés, sweet shops, roadside eateries, salons and barber shops till March 31.

Speaking to TOI on Friday, Kanyakumari collector Prashant M Wadnere said the administration may consider the option of closing the border similar to Coimbatore, in case of emergency.

Apart from intensifying screening to 100%, they have also identified three colleges close to the border as temporary quarantine facilities for mass admission of suspects who enter the state.

Meanwhile, commuters between the two states through Kanyakumari district have come down drastically. Tamil Nadu State Transport Corporation that used to operate 47 buses between Kanyakumari and Thiruvananthapuram has reduced it to around 25 buses per day. “Occupancy in TNSTC and KSRTC (Kerala) buses is only around 50%,” the collector said.

The district administration has also asked guests to avoid weddings that take place till March 31. “We have given this instruction as the possibility of the infection spreading on a large scale is high in a bigger crowd,” he said.

Religious institutions in the district were also asked to avoid prayers or gatherings till March 31. Churches in Kanyakumari district started circulating messages to their members that regular services on Sundays and in the weeks during the Lent season will not take place till the end of this month.

The PM suggested that people could get the required guidance over the phone from a known local doctor, family doctor, or some relative who is a doctor, and in case anyone has a non-essential, elective surgery scheduled, he urged citizens to postpone it by a month.However, ever since the state government announced a partial lockdown across the state as a preventive measure to contain Covid-19 , many hospitals in the city have recorded reduced footfall to the extent of 50%.Dr Padmanabh Kamath, HoD, cardiology and professor, KMC, Mangaluru, told TOI, “From the last few days, we are informing all our patients that if it is not an emergency, not to visit the hospital unnecessarily. The tendency among Indians is that when they come to hospitals, they come with 2-3 bystanders. If there is a small child at home, they bring the child too. That has been the trend, and we do not want a situation where the child also comes to the OPD for no reason. I am requesting all my patients, if they can postpone their visit at least by a week. Since I deal with cardiac cases, I cannot tell them emphatically. We go by the patient’s background. I have also cancelled all peripheral visits. We have to follow all the guidelines,” he said, adding that there is a reduction in the number of patients across all disciplines.An official from a prominent hospital in Mangaluru said that they have recorded at least 30-40% reduction in the number of people visiting the hospital. Most of the cases they are receiving are emergency in nature. One more reason for this is that migration, especially from places like Kerala, Udupi and Karwar, is not happening, and travel in public transport has also reduced by 50%.The hospitals are restricting the number of attendants per patient, and restrictions have been imposed on medical representatives visiting the hospital.Shivaprasad Shetty from the marketing department of AJ Hospital & Research Centre said, “Restrictions have been imposed on visitors and thermal scanners are in use. Patients visiting the hospital has reduced by at least 20 %, and a helpdesk has been set up to look into the travel history of suspects during the past 5-6 days,” he said.Devaraj B, general manager, operations, Unity Hospital, said after the hospital introduced thermal screening, they have noticed a reduction in the number of visitors. Only one attender per patient is allowed from Friday. “We have imposed restrictions on elders and children visiting the hospital as bystanders,” he added.OPDs only in the morningThe management of KMC Hospital, Attavar, has decided that all OPDs will function only in the morning between 9 am to 1 pm, with immediate effect.

While classes have been suspended in the college, the teachers along with a few hostelers were involved in the manufacture of the sanitizers.At present, hand sanitizers have been kept at 20 spots in the campus, including the three gates, and at each department and on the hostel premises. Procuring hand sanitizers for all these places would have been an expensive affair, said SJC Principal M Arockiasamy Xavier. “Therefore, we asked the chemistry department if they can do something about it. They readily agreed and came up with cost-effective hand sanitizer,” he said.“When a 20 ml hand-sanitiser is sold for Rs 50-60 in the market, availability of raw material in the laboratory has facilitated the college to produce it at Rs 70 per litre,” said A Peter Pascal Regis, head of Chemistry department, SJC.When asked how different the hand sanitizer is from the one available in the market, Pascal Regis, said that it was the cost that was the USP. “However, the cost is likely to go up as the cost of raw materials is also shooting up,” he said. Saying that alcohol is the main component constituting 75 per cent of the solution, Pascal Regis said either ethyl alcohol or isopropyl alcohol could be used. The remaining is glycerol, hydrogen peroxide and natural aloe vera gel used in the diluted form.Alcohol is antiseptic, glycerol and aloe vera are mixed as moisturising agents and hydrogen peroxide is a cleansing agent.

NASHIK: A class I officer of Maharashtra Pollution Control Board ’s ( MPCB ) Nashik divisional office was arrested by the anti-corruption bureau (ACB) while accepting a bribe of Rs 10,000 on Thursday.

A press release from the Nashik ACB said that around a month ago the complainant had made an application at the MPCB office to get permission for operating a stone crusher machine.

However, the divisional officer, Prakash Navrutti Dhumal , demanded Rs 10,000 from the complainant for giving the permission. The divisional officer (Class II) Dineshbhai Wasava had also demanded Rs 15,000 for granting permission to operate the stone crusher machine.

After the demands made by the two MPCB officials, the complainant lodged an offence with the Nashik ACB. Accordingly, a trap was laid on Thursday at the MPCP office and Dhumal was arrested after he accepted the powdered currency notes.

The ACB has appealed to the citizens to lodge complaints with them if any government official or employee is demanding bribe for doing their work.

CHANRDRAPUR: Shiv Sena leaders and activists thrashed Jitendra Raut, blackened his face and paraded him on the streets in Sindewahi town for defaming Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj and his family on social media on Friday.

Sindewahi police have registered an offence against Raut for hurting public sentiments by posting derogatory content.

Raut was indulging in the illegal act since many days. There was an uproar among followers of Shivaji Maharaj across the state. “Despite many complaints lodged at different places, Raut refused to budge. Hence, we had to step in and teach him a lesson the Shiv Sena way for defaming our hero,” said Shiv Sena district chief Sandeep Girhe .

He added that after coming to know that Raut lives in Sindewahi, they had submitted a memorandum to SP Chandrapur. They urged him to rein-in Raut and ask him to delete the derogatory content against Shivaji Maharaj from Facebook. Following the instruction from the SP’s office, PSO of Sindewahi, Nishikant Ramteke , summoned Raut and asked him to delete his controversial posts from Facebook. However, Raut remained adamant, claiming that freedom of expression is his constitutional right and that the police should give the request in writing.

On Friday, Shiv Sainiks , led by Girhe, went to Sindewahi in search of Raut. He, however, fled to the fields and hid there. Party activists somehow traced him. He was thrashed publicly and his face was blackened with the ink and paint. Irked activists then garlanded him with sandals and shoes and paraded him on the streets before taking him to the police station.

Sindewahi police booked Raut under section 295A, 153A and 505(2) of the IPC. Sources in the police department said that so far, Raut has not filed any complaint against the assailants.

Raut is a self proclaimed president of Akhil Bhartiya Manavta Paksh. In the past, he has unsuccessfully contested the Lok Sabha and state assembly polls.

357,['21/03/2020'],Nashik: Citizens caught ducking high-priced PF ticket,"NASHIK: The railway officials have discovered to their shock that some unscrupulous elements have been buying short distance train tickets at a cost of around Rs 10 to avoid paying the inflated price of the platform ticket at the Nashik Road railway station.

The railways have increased the platform ticket cost from Rs 10 to Rs 50 to reduce the number of people from entering the station in view of the fast increasing coronovirus cases, but some people, unmindful of the consequences, are trying to find loopholes, said a railway official on Friday.

“The authorities are now starting the sale of tickets only 30 minutes before the arrival of the train for the destinations,” said the official.

The railway officials, during random checking, caught a couple of people on the platform with train tickets to destinations, trains to which were not scheduled for the next few hours.

The Nashik Road railway station has Devlali station towards Mumbai and Odha station towards Bhusawal. And only select trains would halt at these railway stations.

“During a routine check, the ticket examiners came across people with tickets to Devlali stations despite there being no train in that direction for the next two hours,” a railway official said.

An inquiry revealed that the people caught with Rs 10 train tickets had actually come to the station to see off a friend.

“At the Nashik Road railway station, one can buy tickets 24X7. Anybody can go to the ticket counter and get unreserved seats on the train at any point of time. This was the loophole some people took advantage of,” said the official.

“This means that the sale of tickets to the destinations where the cost is less than Rs 50 will start only 30 minutes before the arrival of such trains,” the railway officials said.

Many cabs and autorickshaws could go off the streets, especially for the ‘Janta Curfew’ on Sunday. Autorickshaw unions expect the number of three-wheelers to go down by 20-20%. “The situation is grim for many drivers,” Nitin Pawar, general secretary of the union, Rickshaw Panchayat, said.

Cab aggregators urged people to respect the government’s measures to contain the contagion’s spread. “We will, however, offer services to meet the people,” an Uber spokesperson told TOI, adding that the company suspended its carpool service in Pune and Mumbai.

“Many drivers have logged out simply because there are no passengers,” an Ola driver said, requesting anonymity.

Railway officials, are facing a tough time managing the surging crowds at stations. “We are running special trains for those headed home up north, but the number of passengers is overwhelming. Thermal scanners will soon be installed at the station,” Manoj Jhawar, PRO of the division, said.

360,['21/03/2020'],Nirbhaya convicts: Ordinary men who crossed over to dark side,"File photo of Nirbhaya convicts

NEW DELHI: They were ordinary men, and like everyone had their own traits, some likeable, some unpleasant. Each had a different job, at least four of them: a fitness instructor who loved dancing, bus driver, the driver’s assistant, or ‘cleaner’, and a fruit vendor. The fifth was mostly unemployed but helped clean the bus occasionally and the sixth was an underaged boy who sometimes assisted the bus driver. None had a crime history to speak of. Until a joyride in a bus brought out the demon in them.

Ram Singh, a bus driver, and Mukesh Singh were brothers with a local reputation as toughies who regularly got into fights with neighbours and shopkeepers at Ravidass Camp in south Delhi’s RK Puram. The siblings mostly lived by themselves but were visited once in a while by their parents. It was in Ram Singh’s bus that the six picked up Nirbhaya and her friend on December 16, 2012 from Munirka. The bus driver and his assistant, Akshay Thakur, took turns at the steering wheel as the six ravaged the physiotherapy intern.

Ram Devi, the Singhs’ neighbour, remembered, “The brothers never talked with anyone. There was something strange about their behaviour. If they talked, it was always to argue. They were not kind men.” According to the locals, the mother visited the house once in a while, but she too seldom had conversations, just sat outside the house and smoked a hookah by herself.

Ravidass Camp residents recalled the ruckus when Ram Singh started living with a married woman, whom he later married. In jail no 3 at Tihar, awaiting the verdict in the rape and murder case, Ram Singh was found dead on March 11, 2013.

Mukesh, who held down no permanent job, helped his brother on the bus. He and Vinay Sharma were friends. The latter’s childhood friend, Sapna, said Sharma danced and acted “really well”. “We used to perform together at Janamashtami and for many years, Vinay played the role of Krishna’s friend Sudama. People from other colonies came to see him act,” said Sapna, adding, “His dream was to become a gym trainer which he eventually achieved.

The day Sharma got the job of an instructor at a gym, he went around Ravidass Camp happily telling everyone about it. He wasn’t always so friendly. A woman neighbour revealed that though he often did not pick a fight, he would be the first to join in a brawl in the locality. “Vinay and Mukesh hanged together. They never misbehaved here but there were times we heard stories about them having done something illegal or got into fights,” the woman said.

Thakur too was a friend of Sharma. He was employed by Ram Singh as the cleaner for his bus. It was while working at Manesar that he met the bus driver and a 17-year-old boy who had driven a group of labourers to the site. A police officer who interrogated the men said, “Akshay was a labourer in Gurgaon earning Rs 5,000 a month when Ram Singh offered him Rs 8,000 to work on the bus.”

Thakur had left his family consisting of parents, brothers, his wife and two children in Lahankarma in Bihar’s Aurangabad district in 2010 when he came to Delhi looking for a job. Another cop described him as “calculative” and someone who “could lie through his teeth”. He said, “When we arrested him, he created an alibi showing he hadn’t been present in Delhi during the rape and murder.”

The younger of the accused, Sharma and Pawan Gupta, were the most aggressive of the lot. Ravidass Camp residents were most shocked at Gupta’s arrest. They described the fruit vendor’s family as “kind”, a neighbour sighing, “Kya kismat thi in logo ki, abhi hi aaye the (Bad luck, they had only recently moved here and their son was arrested).”

People in the fruit market, however, recall the young man as a ‘bully’. A vegetable seller who Gupta addressed as Mamu, disclosed, “Pawan bullied people who were not physically strong. He was abusive and his mother always sided with him. It was only after his arrest that his parents toned down.”

A police officer who had interrogated Sharma and Gupta revealed how the two once tried to harm themselves in jail with nails. “We had to use force to take the nails from them,” he said.

Of all the men, it was Thakur’s parents who least afforded regular visits to jail. Saryu Singh, a farm labourer, could not afford the cost of coming often from Bihar. He had also spent much of his savings to send Thakur to Delhi in the hope that he would find a remunerative job. When consoled by jail officials during the family’s last meeting with the death row convict, Saryu Singh groaned, “We have spent all our money due to his deeds.”

Thakur’s brothers, Abhay and Vinay, now work in Gurgaon. They were his regular visitors at Tihar. “He was a good man when he was in the village, but the big city changed him,” claimed Abhay to officials at the family’s last meeting with Thakur. The convict’s wife, Puneeta, stood by him at the time of the arrest, but after seven years of litigation lost the will even to be associated with him and filed for divorce in a Bihar court on Tuesday.

361,['21/03/2020'],Nirbhaya case: He learnt the ropes from his family but waited till Friday to pull lever,"Pawan Jallad

NEW DELHI: He calls himself a hangman, but Pawan Jallad of Meerut couldn’t claim any action of the sort. This embarrassing record changed on Friday when the 58-year-old pulled a lever that left four bodies hanging by the neck till death in Tihar Jail . Jallad told TOI that he had got tired of travelling to Delhi for the hangings and having the execution put off with the four remaining men convicted of raping and murdering 23-year-old Nirbhaya in 2012 taking recourse to various legal remedies since January 22. Friday, however, brought things to a conclusion.

Jallad is the third man in his family bearing that sobriquet, which means an ‘executioner’ in Hindi. He learnt the macabre art from his grandfather, Kallu Jallad, who carried out the final act in January 1989 in the case of the two assassins of former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi. His father, Mammu Jallad, was keen to pull the lever to end the life of Afzal Guru, the accused in the terrorist attack on Parliament, but he died nine months before the execution in February 2013. “My father hanged 12 prisoners during his 47 years of service in the prisons,” he said.

The last time the Meerut resident had the opportunity to notch up a death was four years ago when he was prepped to hang the Nithari rapist-killer Surinder Koli. He rehearsed the execution for a week, but the Supreme Court stayed the death penalty. Before leaving Meerut jail for Delhi on Tuesday, Jallad had remarked it was for the fourth time that he was going for the four men’s hanging at Tihar.

Jallad calls being an executioner a ‘noble profession’ that removes evil people from society. As a father of a daughter — he also has a son — I am happy to hang the rapists and killers of a young girl, the man says. He was hired by the Uttar Pradesh prison authority in 2013 on a stipend of Rs 3,000. But since hanging is not a daily business, he ekes out his living doing odd jobs. The Nirbhaya hangings will boost his meagre income by Rs 20,000 for each condemned man.

As a child, Jallad often accompanied his grandfather and father to jail, but it was only in 1983, when he was 21 years old, that he saw an execution carried out by his grandfather in Agra jail. Three years later, he assisted his father with a hanging for the first time. The last time he was close to the scene of action was in 1992, again aiding his father at Patiala jail.

Friday was to be his first independent execution. But Jallad had to be assisted by a jail official because of the weight of the lever. Jallad doesn’t want his children carrying on the tradition, though. He said: “Most of the hangmen in India belong to families where the men have been executioners. But I don’t want my children to follow in my footsteps.” Is it about being the final cog in a legal system that ends a human being’s life? He shrugs, “Hangings are rare and so the job isn’t paying enough for survival in these times.”

The public sector unit has also cancelled all types of gatherings including weddings, retirement parties and other public functions in its township to avoid the spread of Covid-19.

All vendors except milk, water and newspapers are prohibited from entering the 1,500 acre campus.

The management has also formed a team of 30 volunteers to assist medical professionals at the Bhel hospital and stocked medicines for common cold and flu to treat the employees and their family members.

“We have been encouraging online meetings and thermal scanning is being done at the three entrances of our plant to screen people with travel history to other states and countries in the past 14 days,” a senior official with Bhel said.

Since it is physically a tiring task to check all the 10,000 employees entering the campus, the management has said that it has insisted the security personnel to screen those showing symptoms of Covid-19.

363,['21/03/2020'],U’khand govt bans entry of foreign &amp; domestic tourists in state,"Dehradun: The state government on Friday banned the entry of foreign and domestic tourists in Uttarakhand until further orders in wake of the prevailing Covid-19 threat. In an order issued by state health secretary Nitesh Kumar Jha, it was specified that the step was being taken under the newly-formulated Uttarakhand Epidemic Diseases, Covid-19 Regulations 2020. The move by the Uttarakhand government comes soon after a similar move by neighbouring Himachal Pradesh, which, too, has banned entry of tourists to prevent the spread of the infection.

Setting the context for the move to ban entry of tourists, health secretary Jha said in the order that it has been recognised that social distancing is a potent intervention being implemented to avoid/decrease contact between those who are infected with a disease causing pathogen and those who are not, so as to stop or slow down the rate and extent of disease transmission in a community, eventually leading to decrease in spread, morbidity and mortality due to the disease.

The order further stated that in view of the Covid-19 outbreak, “the state of Uttarakhand was taking all necessary and due precautions and issuing advisories to public at large to avoid any non-essential travel.”

A communique from the CM’s office late evening on Friday said that although the state government has banned entry of tourists, the foreign tourists who are already there will have their visa extended till April 15, as per directives issued by the central government.

Meanwhile, Dehradun SSP/DIG Arun Mohan Joshi told TOI that hotels, guesthouses and lodges in the state capital were being kept in the loop to ensure no tourist arrives.

“The hotel owners have been asked to let police know if any tourist arrives at their properties. We will request them to return. Sealing of borders and placing check-posts at entry points may also be put in place to check the entry of tourists if the situation so warrants,” he said, adding that the government is already advertising that the state has placed a ban on entry of tourists and that people should not panic.

In another related development, the health department on Friday quarantined the staff members of a hotel in the state capital who had come in contact with a Spanish tourist who stayed in the hotel for four days, from March 10 to 14, and was later tested positive for Covid-19 when she went to Faridabad.

As per the daily bulletin issued by the health department, 1192 people have till date been put under surveillance for Covid-19 symptoms of which 440 have completed their 28 days observation period while 58 have gone away from the state. A total of 129 samples have been collected for Covid-19 testing of which 92 are negative, three positive and the results of 34 samples are awaited.

For the past week, city-based chicken stall vendors said that there was a significant dip in daily sales of poultry items. Against the average sales of 500 to 700 kg of chicken per day, the shops here witnessed a minimum of 50% fall in the sales. While the poultry shops association has announced a cash prize for people who prove Covid-19 spreads through poultry items, city-based chicken stalls have come up with their own unique ideas to boost sales. Poultry shops here have started providing four chicken eggs for free with every one kg of chicken purchased.

“Previously, we were selling a kg of chicken between Rs 150 to Rs 180. Now, people can buy three kg of chicken for Rs 180,” B Nagaraj, a chicken stall owner from Bhima Nagar said. As the price per kilogram chicken has come down to Rs 80 now, the chicken stall owners said that the sales are gradually picking up. The stall owners said that they are compromising on their revenue to lower the price to keep the products moving.

“Sales of the eggs have doubled after the price of an egg was brought down to Rs 2.50 per egg from Rs 5. Sales of chicken are also gradually recovering after we slashed the prices,” N Balakrishnan, an egg dealer in the city added.

With schools closed and offices encouraging work from home option for employees, the chicken stall owners rallying on the discounts and freebies anticipate the sales to gain momentum.

Faced with compulsory self-isolation, centenarian film-maker and former BBC journalist Yavar Abbas of London married activist-writer Noor Zaheer , sister of theatre personality Nadira Babbar , 10 days before their scheduled ceremony in London.Matters came to a head when the UK government asked its citizens over 70 to get ready for self-isolation in the wake of the rampaging novel coronavirus . Abbas, who as a British Army photographer had covered World War II in Burma and was present when the Japanese surrendered, and his partner Zaheer, 60, freaked as they had planned the wedding for March 27. When the marriage registration office told them that they couldn’t register marriage during the “self-isolation period”, which could last over a month, they registered it on March 17.“The registration office gave two choices if wanted to get it done before the isolation period began: either one hour from the time we called them or the next morning. We chose the next morning as our witness couldn’t have reached at such a short notice,” said Abbas on phone from London. “We couldn’t have waited for this virus to go away and decided to marry and isolate ourselves at our home. We are spending quality time together.”Born at Charkhari in UP, Abbas studied at Lucknow and Allahabad before turning photographer. After the war, he went to the UK and joined BBC Urdu service; later he became a filmmaker. Delhi’s feisty Zaheer, the youngest of the four daughters of famous progressive Urdu writers and intellectuals Sajjad Zaheer and Razia, stole the heart of Abbas, a widower, with her activism and writings.So what propelled a 100 year old to marry? “The primary motive is love. Age doesn’t stop you when you want to love someone,” explained Abbas, who has lived a fairly adventurous life. During his last visit to Mumbai, he had told TOI how he, along with a friend, had driven all the way to India from England in a car.So for how long they have been courting? “I first met Noor in Allahabad around 12 years ago but in the last one year or so, we have been very close. We didn’t want to live as lovers all life and wanted to spend the rest of our lives as husband-wife,” he said.Zaheer told TOI that her first concern after getting married is to get a spouse visa. “I am very happy for her. If they want, I will hold a reception in Mumbai when they are here next time,” said Nadira.Abbas’s niece (brother’s daughter) Shahla is married to Akhtar Rangoonwala , an executive chairman at Anjuman-I-Islam. “We are very happy for Yavar uncle. Given the positive person he is, we are not surprised that he has married at 100,” said Rangoonwala.A card-carrying communist and former president of Indian People’s Theatre Association (IPTA), Zaheer has several books to her credit, including “My God is a Woman” and “Denied by Allah”. Currently, the newly-married couple is maintaining “social distancing” at their London home.",india,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-47529300,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-110164,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/faced-with-self-isolation-order-centenarian-prepones-marriage/articleshow/74740469.cms

382,['21/03/2020'],Nagpur: Mafsu’s green land now taken over for anti-social activities,"Anti-social elements indulging in gambling at Mafsu campus

NAGPUR: A large part of what was once a lush green pocket in the heart of the city is now predominated by shades of brown. Chopped off tree bases, dried branches and chunks of felled trees can be seen every few feet at the land owned by the Maharashtra Animal and Fishery Sciences University (Mafsu) near Telangkhedi garden.

Following illegal felling of nearly 300 age-old trees, TOI visited the spot along with honorary wildlife warden of Nagpur Jaydeep Das. Adjacent to Bharat Van, the over 30-acre land is not just one of the last remaining biodiversity hotspots of the city but also a hub for anti-social elements and criminal activities. Every nook and corner of the land corroborates the failure of civic agencies in protecting the green cover.

While walking deep inside the mini-forest, TOI noticed at least 20-25 stumps of felled trees. Apart from it, a large number of felled branches, cut into small pieces for easy transportation, were visible everywhere. “The land is turning barren. By the remains, it is evident that the felled trees were age-old,” said Das.

Signs of trespassing were striking — plastic wrappers, empty liquor bottles, cigarette butts and small bonfires indicated that the place is frequented by anti-social elements.

What was most shocking were the small tunnels that were made by breaking the compound walls of the land. “Trespassers use them to come inside and do all sorts of activities. The tunnels are also used to pass on timber,” said Das.

On going ahead towards Bharat Van side, more liquor bottles and tree stumps were visible. “This large-scale tree felling is not an overnight job. It must have been going on since months or even a few years,” said Das.

The area is home to not just trees but also birds and animals and needs to be conserved. During the visit, TOI spotted a large variety of species including peacocks, sunbirds, herons, drongos, cuckoo etc. “Like Bharat Van, this is also a rich biodiversity habitat. Some trees here are over 50 years old,” said Das.

Even a four-wheel vehicle had entered the are was evident from the tyre marks seen on the ground. According to the residents of Bharat Nagar, the contractor would chop trees using a chain saw machine and then transport the timber in a big vehicle. “How is it possible that the authorities were not aware of all this happening in their premises,” they questioned.

Since the incident of illegal tree felling came to fore, Mafsu has maintained that it was unaware of any such activity. The university officials also filed an first information report (FIR) against unidentified person at Ambazari police station, pressing charges of theft.

While coming out of the premises, TOI saw a group of men consuming liquor in broad daylight. Slamming Mafsu for its lackadaisical attitude, Das said, “Mischief mongers use lands owned by Mafsu and Dr Panjabrao Deshmukh Krishi Vidyapeeth for illegal activities and the same has been reported many times by alert citizens. This time we have witnessed it ourselves at a time when section 144 is imposed. If these agencies can’t manage the land, then the government should hand it over to the forest department.”

Das added that such green pockets in urban areas should be declared as forests.

Stating that there is no genuine concern nor system of checking accountability for the upkeep of land bank, green activist Amit Heda said, “Regular monitoring, system of penalizing the authority in-charge should be set up. If possible, the land should be mandatorily given for constructive use, be it for social purpose and it's independent audit should be done.”

The chief educational office said the speculation had not impacted the students appearing for the examination and the percentage of absentees remained low.

Since regular classes and special classes were suspended in schools to prevent the spread of Covid-19 a few days ago, there was speculation about the board examinations being cancelled as well.

Central board of secondary education (CBSE) had postponed the board examinations for class X and XII till March 31 on Thursday. This had raised expectations about the state government also following suit. However, no announcement came in this regard and the examinations were held as usual on Friday.

Class XII students of various streams appeared for a total of seven subjects on Friday including Biology, Botany, Business Maths, Office Management, History, Basic electrical engineering and basic mechanical engineering. Out of a total of 24,237 registered students, 23,264 appeared for the examination and 973 were absent.

NEW DELHI: Hours after the four Nirbhaya convicts were hanged on Friday, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal stressed the need to address the loopholes in the judicial system that “favour” the culprits.

Kejriwal said the whole country had been waiting for seven years to get justice for Nirbhaya and now everybody would resolve that no such incident would ever happen in the country.

There were attempts to manipulate the legal system and delay the whole process despite issuance of repeated death warrants, the chief minister said in a statement.

“This whole case shows the number of loopholes we have in our judicial system, which gives the people a free hand in delaying justice for seven years. We all have to work together and strengthen the system to ensure speedy justice to the victims,” he added. “We have to work together to address the loopholes in our judicial system that favour the culprits.”

The first death warrant to execute the four convicts was issued on January 22. But with the convicts attempting to escape the gallows by resorting to legal remedies, the court had to postpone the date first to February 1 and then to March 3, before the execution could finally take place on March 20.

The chief minister also pointed at the need to strengthen the police system and change the way women are treated when they go to file a complaint, FIRs don’t get registered or culprits put pressure on the cops to harass the survivors. “We need to ensure that police investigations are completed in a swift manner,” Kejriwal said.

There is also a need to change the judicial system so that a survivor or a victim’s family doesn’t “have to wait for seven long years but gets justice within six months”, he emphasised.

Since Delhi government does not have the administrative control over the police force and the judicial system, Kejriwal said, efforts are being made to strengthen other systems to provide security to every woman in the city.

“We are installing CCTV cameras and streetlights across Delhi to cover all dark spots and have deployed marshals in buses to ensure safety of women,” he pointed out.

The consequence: an imminent shortage of the equipment and slowing down of internet connectivity with increased consumption.Shekhar G, who is in the wholesale business of internet equipment for over seven years, confirmed the spike in demand for dongles and hotspot devices over the past week. “Most of our customers are either smaller companies or youngsters living in PGs who do not have WiFi connections. One of my clients told me that till recently he’d manage with hotspot from phone internet, but now, frequent video and conference calls have forced him to purchase hotspot equipment,” he said.Lakshmipathi, an executive with a popular service provider, said he had never seen such a sudden rise in demand for hotspot devices and new WiFi connections in his 11 years in the field. “The shortage in the market is because these dongles are manufactured in China and we are avoiding imports from there. Several of my customers have faced a shortage not just in physical stores but on online portals,” he said.Divya Soman, a writer, is attending conference calls and multi-tasking on her laptop for the last one week. She says she ordered for a dongle online and within half an hour it was out of stock. “My sister asked for one and before I could order it for her, it was gone.

NAGPUR: Social media groups in Nagpur were abuzz on Friday evening as a list of home quarantined persons in the city went viral and people expressing shock at the breach of privacy.

The list had names of over 300 people in Nagpur city who have been advised home quarantine/isolation. Apart from the person’s name, the list has details like their residential address, mobile number, start date of quarantine and name of police station under whose jurisdiction the person’s residence comes.

Though the list is now spinning around on social media and gaining a life of its own, TOI has learnt that it was made public by the authorities themselves. Speaking to TOI, divisional commissioner Sanjeev Kumar said that the list was made public by his office as part of an effort to seek help from community members in ensuring people conform to self-isolation guidelines.

“The names and address are available on the portal. We just want people to keep an eye in the neighbourhood and inform us if they see these people socializing,” said Kumar.

He added that names of those who have tested positive must not be made public, and that it does not apply to those in home quarantine.

With the list going viral, city police were almost on the verge of registering a complaint and getting ready to take action against those sharing it. Sources say they stopped after learning that it was the authorities themselves who had shared the list.

A glance through the list throws up prominent names from the city who most probably returned from abroad and have been advised home quarantine as a precaution. Right from senior doctors, educationists, businessmen to professionals — about 10 names there could easily figure in the city’s Who’s Who list.

NEW DELHI: While one mother enjoyed a long-awaited victory, another saw her world collapsing around her. Ram Bai, 80, wailed when she heard news confirming the hanging of her son Mukesh Kumar Singh on Friday morning. She had lost her other son, Ram Singh, who was found dead in jail, possibly due to suicide, a few months after the rape and murder of Nirbhaya in December 2012.

In RK Puram’s Ravidass Camp, home to the Singh brothers, Pawan Gupta and Vinay Sharma, there was a pall of gloom when the bodies arrived in the afternoon. While Gupta’s family stood on the road outside to mourn, the frail Ram Bai sat in a corner of her shanty and grieved alone.

“I was clinging to hope all these years. They could have given Mukesh a life sentence, and I could at least have heard his voice again. But they killed him,” the octogenarian sobbed. The old woman blamed the lengthy litigation for the predicament. “If they had hanged them right after the incident, we wouldn’t hurt so much. But they gave us hope all these years and I spent all the money I had on the legal process. Now he is gone and I am left with nothing. What hope do I have now?” she said.

Gupta’s sisters continued to believe in his innocence, insisting that he was at the local park at the time of the horrifying rape. “When we met him for the last time, he kept hugging us and kept pleading with us to help him,” said the elder sister. “He was innocent and yet we have lost face in society. Who will marry his younger sister now?”

Unlike the crowd at the house of Nirbhaya’s family in Dwarka, there was almost nobody at Ravidass Camp offering condolences to the bereaved families. They only had each other for company. Lawyer A P Singh was present. Gupta’s elder sister visited Ram Bai to see how she was doing. “Has anything changed for women after 2012? Nothing. And this will remain so, no matter how many people you hang,” the sister said defiantly.

In a lane, a carpet had been laid out for the women to mourn together. “Ram, Mukesh, Pawan, Akshay and Vinay were friends though our families didn’t interact with each other much,” the sister disclosed. “After the incident, however, we’ve become close because there’s no one who even looks at us, let alone talks to us or helps ease our pain.”

Gupta’s mother lost consciousness while awaiting his body. She was revived but refused to utter a word, only cried continuously through the day.

The four men — Akshay Thakur’s home is in Bihar — were hanged simultaneously at 5.30am on Friday and their bodies taken for postmortem to Deen Dayal Upadhyay Hospital at 8.30 am. There, the gate to the mortuary was closed and paramilitary personnel posted to prevent any disturbances. Thakur’s family was the first to arrive at the mortuary, followed by the others.

Wearing a purple shirt and chappals, Vinay Sharma’s father arrived with police officers to claim his son’s body. Crying without a stop, he left the mortuary with the body for Ravidass Camp around 1.30pm. Gupta’s family followed him to their residence. The bodies of Singh and Thakur were taken, respectively, to their villages in Rajasthan and Bihar.

PUNE: The impact of Covid-19 has brought down the occupancy rate at city hotels, including five-stars, to 5-10%, a source in the Pune Hoteliers ’ Association (PHA) revealed on Friday.

The association said that if the situation continued even for a short run, there would be massive layoffs and hotel closures.

PHA recently wrote to chief minister Uddhav Thackeray seeking interim relief during the current crisis, including deferment of payment for renewal of excise licenses till the situation was under control, total rollback of 15% increment in license fees, waiver of property tax and SGST for the period 2020-21, a complete Goods and Services Tax holiday for the tourism, travel and hospitality industry for the next twelve months, cancellation of duties and penalties from MSEDCL, among others.

“Taking cognisance of the situation, PHA has written to the CM seeking relief given the huge losses facing the industry. In light of the drastic fall in occupancy and customers at the restaurants, PHA has requested the government for assistance in offering relief in licence fees, levies, taxes, duties and GST on various amenities including electricity, fuel, excise and municipal levies to tide over the current crisis,” a PHA source told TOI.

PHA members include over 90 major star and independently operated hotels and hotel management institutes in the city. The association has also sent copies of the appeal to the tourism department, municipal commissioners of PMC and PCMC and Pune district collector.

393,['21/03/2020'],Pune: Panic buying triggers three-fold increase in sales of grain,"Representative image

PUNE: The possibility of lockdown in the city over the Covid-19 situation triggered “panic buying” in the grain market over the past few days, prompting about three-fold increase in sales and subsequent price surge.

Retailers and consumers have been picking up huge quantities of pulses like tur, mung and masoor dal from the markets following the sudden surge in Covid-19 cases in Pune, which has the highest cases of infection so far in India. Grain wholesalers quoted a 200-300% increase in business in the past 10 days.

Prices of key pulses like tur, mung and masoor dals surged by Rs8-10 per kg in some retail outlets in the city because of the brisk-buying. Wholesalers claimed that the Covid-19 spread in the city also caused grain transporters from places like Latur, Jaipur and Rajasthan, among others, to refrain from coming to Pune.

Dhaval Shah, the director of Jairaj Group in Gultekdi wholesale market, told TOI that the sales of grains in the market increased three-fold in the past 10 days. “Whoever is selling grocery — retailers, malls, supermarkets and online grocery portals — are stocking up on supplies primarily because consumers are panic buying in large quantities as they feel that somewhere down the line everything may shutdown or there could be a price rise and it’s better to stock up now,” he said.

Shah said the wholesale prices of all the pulses had gone up by Rs4-5 per kg and so the retail prices surged.

Khushal Unecha, the owner of Ganpat supermarket in Gokahlenagar , said, “The retail prices of red masoor, mung and tur dal have gone up by Rs4-10 per kg in the past eight to 10 days. Wheat prices have also seen an increase of Rs2 per kg in the retail market recently. Consumers are panic buying in the market and hence, prices are increasing in almost all grain categories.”

Another grain wholesaler in Market Yard said he was fast running out of stock of some grains because of two reasons: panic buying as well as grain transporters from places like Latur and Jalgaon refraining from coming to Pune fearing the spread of Covid-19.

“As against the 500 trucks coming to the market daily earlier, we see about 100 to 150 trucks these days from such locations. Wheat stocks coming from states like Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh have also decreased though wheat production this time has been very high. This is mainly because of the transporters’ reluctance to come to Pune now-a-days,” he said.

Valaram Ghalout of a city-based retail store said customers had been buying stock for two months at a time, anticipating possible shortage later.

397,['21/03/2020'],Complete lockdown of Nagpur till March 31,"Representative image

NAGPUR: To stop coronavirus from becoming a full-blown epidemic, Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) commissioner Tukaram Mundhe on Friday declared a complete lockdown of the city from Saturday under the Epidemic Diseases Act, 1897, till March 31. The order followed chief minister Uddhav Thackeray ’s decision to lock down all major cities in state, Mumbai, Pune, Pimpri, and Nagpur.

In Amravati too, collector Shailesh Naval ordered closure of all permit rooms, wine shops, and restaurants till March 25. In Chandrapur, Section 144 was imposed from Friday and all establishments were told to observe complete clampdown from Saturday evening.

The Nagpur order means all establishments, excluding essential services like groceries and medicines, would be shut down till March 31, and there would be a partial curfew-like situation in the city.

Taxi services like Ola, Uber and autorickshaws wouldn’t be allowed to ply. However, Mundhe said the administration would allow ‘home delivery’ of food from restaurants and hotels, and also similar service by food delivery chains like Zomato and Swiggy.

Divisional commissioner Sanjeev Kumar told TOI that industrial establishments in and outside city limits, like in Hingna, Butibori, Kalmeshwar and even Mihan, would be closed till March 31.

“Also, any other industry coming within 15km of Nagpur city limit would be shut. We, however, would allow autos to ply in medical and other emergency situations,” he said.

MahaMetro has declared there will be no Metro services on Sunday, and trains will run at 30 minute intervals on Saturday. NMC would also keep its city bus service closed on Sunday and operate only minimal services. Even BSNL has closed all its customer service centres.

Police commissioner Bhushan Kumar Upadhyay declared that all orders issued by the collector and NMC chief would be strictly enforced in the city and those violating would be brought to book.

Justifying the decision to close down all establishments, Mundhe said this will ensure citizens don’t gather at one place, and stop the spread of coronavirus. “All establishments, including industrial units and private offices, would be closed till March 31. This was done to maintain social distancing in view of Covid-19 threats,” he said, while warning of action under Section 188 of IPC, where a person can be kept behind bars for a month.

Earlier, guardian minister Nitin Raut reviewed Covid-19 preparations along with senior police and IAS officers. He assured action against shopkeepers keeping their establishments open despite closure orders.

On Thursday, home minister Anil Deshmukh had raided Haldiram’s and Sujal Saoji, and directed offences against both. Later, cops had registered offences against some restaurants for parcel delivery and also against Zomato.

On reports of the city borders being sealed for outsiders, Raut said vehicles with outside registration numbers will be stopped at check points and their occupants will be questioned. “There is no restriction on coming to Nagpur. Vehicles with city registration numbers will not be stopped. The lock down of suburban areas like Wadi and Kamptee is under consideration,” he said.

The state government has already closed malls, theatres, schools and colleges, clubs, pubs, amusement parks and other places of public gathering. “Citizens shouldn’t go out of their homes at any cost except for essential services. All places of mass gathering, including vegetable markets, would be shut down and even morning walk or jogging will be prohibited. NMC assistant commissioners along with local police would keep a close watch on entire city to stop people from coming out of homes,” the NMC commissioner said.

The administration has also decided to come down heavily on people spitting on roads in public. “Our Nuisance Detection Squads (NDS) along with cops would keep watch on such activities. Those spitting would be imposed a fine of Rs1,000 on the spot,” Mundhe added.

Speaking on government directives to work with 25% workforce, Nagpur University vice chancellor SP Kane said they would first ask employees whether they want to work voluntarily. “Accordingly, we will employ them in shifts of two to three hours each.”

In other development, Legal Metrology Department’s divisional deputy controller DL Kove asked pharmacy shops to display availability of masks and sanitizers outside their establishments in view of their growing demand.

PANAJI: Goa-Inc has been left rattled by the global spurt in Covid-19 cases. Private firms are reporting project delays and even cancellations.

The pharmaceutical sector, which has about three month’s worth of stock of the important active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) is worried about the API supply chain getting affected if the spread of Covid-19 is not curtailed.

Information technology firms and manufacturing units, meanwhile, have asked employees to cancel all travel plans. Workers who have a cold and fever have been asked to stay home.

“Contracts are getting cancelled and some manufacturers are not going for full production as they depend on imports and there could be short supply of raw material,” Goa State Industries Association president Damodar Kochkar said.

While cancellation of orders has left the IT sector and pharma sector untouched, manufacturing units depending on foreign clients, or requiring components from China, remain in a precarious situation.

Chief executive officer of Umang and president of Goa Technology Association (GTA) Manguirish Salelkar said that Goa’s IT startups and IT companies have cancelled all travel plans. “The sector which will get affected is the gig economy and companies in the delivery business. Companies are giving hygiene training to staff that meet people. Hand sanitizers are being kept at different locations and all are following NASSCOM advisories,” Salelkar said.

The American College of Culinary & Language Arts (ACCLA) has prohibited students and officials from travelling to China, South Korea, Italy, Iran, France, Spain and Germany. A Verna-based manufacturing unit which was in the midst of upgrading its machinery has had to temporarily shelve the plans as the overseas technicians can no longer travel to Goa.

“As of now, we have not come across any positive Covid-19 despite screening nearly 30 patients. The passengers with symptoms are doing well and the tests also show four of them as negative. Nonetheless, we are looking for space to set up additional wards to handle any situation that arises,” said MGM dean Dr K Vanitha.

As the isolation ward – I on the campus seems to be inadequate, given the number of increasing suspecting cases every day, three floors of the de-addiction centre building was converted into an isolation ward recently. Ward-I has 12 beds, while ward-II has 30 beds.

“In case a situation arises where we have to increase the number of beds, we have planned to convert the underutilized buildings on our campus into isolation wards,” said the dean.

Dr Vanitha also exuded confidence of treating Covid-19 positive cases here. “Though there will be positive cases, they will recover with the treatment provided by the team of doctors in the isolation ward,” she said.

For the intensive care unit (ICU) facility for suspected Covid-19 cases, the hospital administration has reserved four beds in the isolation ward – I.

The hospital has 87 ventilators and few more ventilators will be added, she said. “There has been no need for using ventilators till now, though we have the facility,” added the dean.

The hospital administration earlier relied on the King institute in Chennai for testing swab samples for Covid-19. The time taken for testing has been reduced to one day after the government medical college in Tiruvarur started testing at the viral research and diagnostic laboratory there since last week.

NASHIK: All schools in the city have decided to call their teaching and non-teaching staff on a rotation basis to ensure only 25% attendance.

Zilla Parishad education officer (acting) Pravin Patil said that everyone cannot work from home. “Teachers have to come to school to correct the SSC and HSC examination papers, while the non-teaching staff has to come to water the plants and cleaning the rooms, etc. Hence, the state government has decided to call 25% of them every day.”

Officials said two examination papers of SSC students are still left — on Saturday and Monday. Those who have duty on these two days will have to come and the new instructions will be issued from Tuesday, he added.

In order to implement the instructions, the schools will call the teachers and the non-teaching staff on a rotation basis. For example, if teacher ‘A’ comes to school on Monday, s/he will have to come to school again on Friday.

Moreover, the city schools are ready with all the data to implement the decision of the state government to cancel the examinations of Class I to Class VIII and prepare the results with the half yearly examinations and class tests.

“We come out with the results on May 1 every year. We will be able to do it this year also so that the next academic year is not delayed for any reason. The move of the state government will ease the process for us,” added Patil.

Shrikant Shukla, joint secretary, Ashoka Education Foundation , said “We had anticipated the worst-case scenario and we are ready for any decision that the government comes up with. Only headmasters and principals are coming to our schools and taking care of the situation.”

The state government has also announced that the examination of Class IX and Class XI exams will be taken after April 15.

Out of the 426 passengers who landed at the international airport on four flights from Sharjah, Dubai and Singapore, health department officials separated 24 men and two women based on their travel history (to countries most affected by Covid-19) or comorbidity or age — above 60 years. All of them were brought to the central vegetable market by 108 ambulances in the early hours of Friday. They have been made to stay in the shops that were furnished with cots and beds.

“If they show no symptoms of Covid-19, they will be sent home with an advice for self-quarantine for 14 days,” deputy director of health services (DDHS) Dr A Subramani said. The 28 passengers already sent home late Thursday night after a day of quarantine had not shown any symptoms. On being sent home, the passengers have been asked to follow a healthy diet for sometime. Subramani said the passengers have been advised not to have non-vegetarian food for time being. “We are asking them to take millet and easily digestible food to keep them fit and immunized in order to protect themselves from infection,” he said.

Seven passengers with symptoms of Covid-19 were still kept under observation at the isolation ward in Trichy on Friday as the results of their swab test were awaited from the viral research and diagnostic laboratory (VRDL) at the government medical college hospital in Tiruvarur. Issuing strict warning against rumour mongers, Trichy collector S Sivarasu said such action will attract penal action from the law enforcers.

MANGALURU: College is shut but Nisha, a first-year BBA aviation student of Srinivas University , is still sitting for classes, taking notes and marking attendance. The varsity began online classes five days ago and with the clampdown to prevent spread of Covid-19 getting longer, many more are likely to follow suit.

“Though I don’t get a classroom feel, there is satisfaction that I am not missing my regular classes, which are crucial. I am enjoying this new mode of,” Nisha said.

The government has instructed all educational institutions to shut down till this month-end. From March 15, Srinivas University began online classes for 4,000-odd undergraduate and post-graduate students. “Students will suffer if classes are suspended for a longer period, especially those in the final year of their courses who would be eager to graduate and find jobs soon. So we decided to offer theory classes to BBA, BCom and engineering courses through Skype, Google Classroom and other apps,” said vice-chancellor PS Aithal.

“There is a good percentage of attendance and we know this through a software which, at the end of the day, informs parents about the number of classes held and attended by their ward,” he said. “Students with poor internet connection can access the lectures through WhatsApp .”

Aithal added that the lessons taught online will be repeated in classrooms once college reopens.

MAHE figuring it out

Manipal Academy of Higher Education is looking at online classes should the shutdown get longer. “We have discussed the possibility but concerns were raised about how classes with practicals can be conducted online. We are trying to find a solution,” Dr HS Ballal, pro-chancellor of MAHE, said.

‘Time to look at

study-from-home option’

Stepping up to the plate, e-learning platforms are opening their virtual classrooms for everybody and hoping traditional setups explore an online channel for the future as well.

“Given that schools are shut and studies interrupted, we are making live classes completely free for all students in Classes 5 to 12,” said Zishaan Hayath, CEO and co-founder of Toppr.

Shobhit Bhatnagar, CEO and co-founder of Gradeup, said the edtech industry is gearing up for its biggest test and opportunity as universities around the world go into lockdown mode. “The likes of Harvard have already begun the transition from offline to online, and I can see Indian universities and schools following suit. The biggest benefit that our industry can offer, especially in times like these, is live online classes which provide a safe and convenient study-from-home option,” she said.

Anant Goyal, director and founder of Bright Tutee, said: “We have offered 1500-plus hours of video lectures for 18 state boards completely free. We have seen a 124% increase in student engagement through this on our platform and will continue to offer the same till this situation stabilises.”

412,['21/03/2020'],"Meerut's iconic Nauchandi fair may not be held this year, a first in 1,000 years","Meerut: Iconic Nauchandi fair of Meerut may not be held this time in a bid to contain the spread of novel coronavirus, a first such departure in its 1,000 years old history which withstood several events, including 1857 mutiny and post-Independence communal riots.

The importance of the fair could be gauged by the fact that the government named a train after it-- Nauchandi Express connecting Meerut with state capital Lucknow. Known to have started in 11th century, this annual fair never took a break.

“Even major events like 1857 mutiny and communal riots at the time of partition in 1947 could not stop this month-long fair that starts a fortnight after Holi every year. But this year, the circumstances might lead to its cancellation,” says Mufti Mohammad Ashraf, 63-year-old trustee of Hazrat Bale Mian dargah and 23rd generation descendant of Hazrat Bale Mian’s brother. Hazrat Bale Mian was a Sufi saint who was killed at a young age of 19 years. A shrine, Bale Miya Dargah, was built in his memory.

The saint was killed on new moon night, which means ‘naya chand' in Urdu. After that, a congregation began attending his death anniversary at the shrine which is adjacent to Meerut’s Nauchandi Ground. Later, it transformed into an annual fair.

The administration too is not keen on holding the fair this year. District magistrate (DM) of Meerut Anil Dhingra categorically denied holding the fair according to the plan.

Divisional commissioner of Meerut, Anita Meshram, said, “This time, the chances are slim as all the stalls in the fair come from Bulandshahr where a local fair culminates before moving to Meerut. And that fair has already been cancelled.”

An ancient temple, Chandi Devi Mandir, right in the front of Bale Mian’s shrine, symbolizes the Hindu-Muslim unity.

“The name, Nauchandi is actually named after Goddess Chandi and the fair takes place at the time of Navratras and hence the name Nauchandi,” claims temple priest Mahender Kumar Sharma. However, the shrine caretakers have a different take on that.

413,['21/03/2020'],NIO find of coral-invading sponge in top 10 marine species,"Panaji: More bad news for coral reefs—a new species of coral-eroding marine sponge, Cliona thomasi, belonging to the invasive group of cliona sponges from the Caribbean islands, has been identified off the Malvan coast. A team of researchers from Goa’s national institute of oceanography (NIO), led by Baban Ingole, retired head of NIO’s biological oceanography division, discovered the sponge, that is also present in an around Goa’s Grand Island.

The invasive sponge species, which live in association with corals and infests them, finds pollution and climate change conditions favourable. The bleaching of corals due to higher temperatures makes them vulnerable to disease. Taking advantage of this, Cliona thomasi grows over the dying corals, spreading a brown carpet over them and creating small cavities in the corals. “The discovery may help scientists understand various aspects of the sponge in finding out a solution to restore the degrading coral reefs,” Ingole said. Ingole’s team comprised two Indian researchers, Sambhaji Mote and Vishal Gupta, and Australian and South African counterparts, C Schonberg and T Samaai, in a Maharashtra government project to inventorise marine biodiversity in the region. “The study is important , because if the same scenario of increasing temperature and pollution persist, corals might disappear and invading sponge species like Cliona thomasi may take over the reefs,” Ingole said.

The sponge may be dull-looking but its finding has excited scientists globally. The world register of marine species (WoRMS) has included it in the list of top-ten remarkable new marine species of 2019. The list was released on March 19 to coincide with world taxonomist appreciation day.

“Each of these marine animals has a story. This year, the chosen species are in some cases particularly small, large, hidden, or rather sparkly,” write WoRMS editors. Rubbing fins with the sponge in the WoRMS database are a few other species, such as the green rat clingfish from Australia, Mediterranean branching placozoan, and “star of the sea” shrimp from the Caribbean sea.The sponge, which is also found in the coral reefs along Grande Island off the Mormugao coast, has been named after reputed Indian sponge taxonomist, P A Thomas. Being commonly found in Indian ocean coral reefs, it was for some time wrongly identified due to its complex taxonomy.

Goa’s islands – and also Malvan marine park in Maharashtra - harbour rich coral biodiversity, though Andaman and Nicobar islands account for a major part of the 206 species of corals in Indian reefs.

“The new species is a bioeroding sponge and these fulfill many important functions in marine habitats,” the paper published in international journal “Systematic Biology” states.

The sponges are known for various ecoservices, recycling process and also creating habitats for smaller organisms. The team has collected many samples of species, and the newly-discovered sponge is one of the few exciting findings being studied.

414,['21/03/2020'],Polling staff liken conduct of ZP polls to suicide mission,"Panaji: With the zilla panchayat (ZP) elections now further postponed, distraught polling staff, who had long been petitioning election authorities to defer the polls, heaved a sigh of relief on Friday.

They had earlier termed the government’s doggedness to conduct the March 22 elections a “suicide mission” in wake of the rapid spread of coronavirus across several parts of India.

At least 9,500 staff were to be posted at 1,210 polling booths in the state. Arrangements were also made for over eight lakh voters to pick their candidate through ballot paper.

Polling staff, who generally interact with hundreds of voters, had been asking their returning officers and mamlatdars about provision of hand sanitisers and face masks, only to be given wishy-washy replies and no concrete assurances that these would in fact be provided.

When they had inquired about their safety and that of lakhs of voters at a training session held earlier this week, the mamlatdar had merely told them sanitisers were in short supply.

“He (mamlatdar) said we would get liquid soap and water instead. How can we leave the polling booth and keep going out to wash our hands?” a government employee who had been put on polling duty, told TOI.

Staff at each polling booth (five inside and two police personnel outside) had said the elections posed a high risk of the virus spreading as they would have to physically check ID proofs provided by each voter, hand them a pen to sign their names, ink their index fingers and hand them ballot paper to vote.

In addition to this, all voters would be handling the same stamp to cast their vote on the ballot paper.

“We asked the authorities to postpone the election not just for us, but for the voters too. I’m young and fit, but what happens when I go home to my old mother and children? I’m putting everybody at risk,” a government employee on polling duty had told TOI.

Another polling staff said the chaos usually begins at distribution centres the night before itself, where all the polling staff gather to collect their stationery. “If everything else is being cancelled, why not this? What role do ZPs play, anyway? They don’t have powers,” a booth level officer had told TOI.

Those on polling duty had approached the collector even on Friday, a day after chief minister Pramod Sawant had announced that the ZP elections were postponed to March 24. They had sought that the polls be called off entirely, stating that the next two weeks were crucial for India as it was on the verge of entering Stage 3 of the pandemic declared by WHO.

They had raised concerns that voters in different parts of the nation and even overseas would cast their vote and could act as vectors because the virus is transmitted through touch.

KOLKATA: Restaurants and liquor off-shops in Kolkata will stay shut during Sunday’s “Janata Curfew”. Plagued by plunging footfall since last week, both the restaurants’ bodies in the city have urged their members to join the “curfew”, which will also save them from losses.

Whether the eateries, bars and liquor stores would be kept shut — for the time being — even after Sunday would be decided over the weekend, maintained both National Restaurants Association of India (NRAI) and Hotel and Restaurants Association of Eastern India (HRAEI).

There, however, is a silver lining for those who would miss restaurant food on Sunday. The president of NRAI’s Kolkata chapter, Sagar Daryani, said several restaurants are set to continue their home-delivery service for customers who order through apps. The 200 members of NRAI in the city includes Wow! Momo, Dominos, KFC, Pizza Hut, Mio Amore, Monginis along with others. HRAEI secretary Sudesh Poddar told TOI that on Sunday, all its members — around 1,200 — would keep their restaurants shut.

“We shall be closed as per the advice of the Prime Minister. From Monday, though, our bars and restaurants will remain open,” he added.

Many, however, are mulling a shutdown for the time being to avoid losses. “The guest count has been steadily plunging since last week. On Friday evening, which is normally a busy time for us, the footfall was 25%-30% lower than usual. It is bound to get halved on Saturday,” said the owner of a central Kolkata restobar.

TRICHY: The city police arrested two youths on Thursday night for hurling petrol bombs at a woman’s house in Golden Rock on Tuesday night. Police cited spurned love as the reason behind the attack and arrested S Mayuran from Burma Colony in Gundur and his friend Velmurugan based on a complaint by the woman’s father.

According to the complainant, Mayuran was allegedly in love with his daughter since 2017 but she later broke up with him disapproving of his character. Mayuran had recently gone to her college and insisted that she get back with him. As she rejected him, an enraged Mayuran picked up a quarrel with the woman’s uncle on March 16.

On March 17, at around 11.30pm, the complainant came out of his house on hearing a noise. He found a tree in his compound on fire after the two hurled a petrol bomb. As the complainant reprimanded Mayuran, he threw another bomb at him. The bomb missed him and hit the window of his house. As the neighbours rushed to the spot, the duo fled the scene.

NEW DELHI: Delhi recorded its warmest day of the season on Friday. The mercury touched 31.4 degrees Celsius at Safdarjung, which is considered the base station for the capital.

The Met department has predicted a similar maximum temperature on Saturday. A spell of light rain is also expected the same day, accompanied by gusty winds ranging from 30-40 km/hr.

Delhi will come under the influence of another western disturbance on March 24-25, bringing further rain, officials said.

“A weak western disturbance is influencing parts of northwest India, which will bring rain to NCR. There is also a possibility of very light rain occurring on Friday night itself, but the majority of activity will occur on Saturday,” said Kuldeep Srivastava, scientist at India Meteorological Department.

With a high of 30.7 degrees Celsius, the maximum temperature had crossed the 30-degree mark for the first time this season on Thursday. This, however, was around the normal mark for this time of the season. On Friday, the mercury was recorded a degree above normal. The minimum, meanwhile, was recorded at 16.4 degrees Celsius. Met officials forecast a gradual rise in night-time temperature in the coming days, with mercury likely to touch 19 degrees by March 25.

Air quality remained in the higher end of the moderate category on Friday with a reading of 192 on CPCB’s daily index. Forecast for Friday shows a maximum of 31 degrees Celsius, while the minimum will be around 17.

This is the first time that the decade-old parikrama has been cancelled.

Confirming this to TOI, Ayodhya DM Anuj Kumar Jha said the administration has cancelled it to avoid large public gathering during the event. The event witnesses circumambulation of devotees and seers around the Ram Janambhoomi site every year. The Parikrama and the assembly of seers is organized by Vikramaditya Mahotsav Samiti.

BJP’s Ayodhya MLA Ved Prakash Gupta said the event holds immense importance for Ayodhya natives as it connects them directly with Ramjanmabhoomi. “We received the information about cancellation of event on Friday morning,” he said. Ramkot is the main place of worship in Ayodhya, and the site of the ancient citadel of its namesake, standing on elevated ground in the western part of the temple town. It attracts devotees from across the world on Ram Navami — the birthday of Lord Ram.

The parikrama, started a decade ago, is attended by around 1,000 people, including members of Vishwa Hindu Parishad .

VHP spokesperson Sharad Sharma said the cancellation was the need of the hour. “The congregation of devotees and events are only successful when people are safe,” he said.

420,['21/03/2020'],"Janata curfew: Senior citizens prioritise, put well-being over voting","The elderly said it was irresponsible to risk the lives of citizens

PANAJI: Senior citizens on Friday said the state government should have taken a proactive decision to defer the March 22 zilla panchayat (ZP) elections even before Prime Minister Narendra Modi called for ‘Janata Curfew’ for Sunday. They said it was irresponsible to risk the lives of citizens, especially the elderly, by deciding to hold the polls despite repeated warnings about the Covid-19 threat.

Many like Bambolim-based retired banker Datta Madkaikar, said he had already decided not to vote even if the state had gone ahead with the elections. “It is not like there will be a law and order situation if the ZP polls are not held. What is the significance of these elections anyway?” he said. His friends concurred, he said.

Madkaikar said he would rather heed the PM’s advice that those above the age of 60 should remain indoors at all costs until March 31.

Chinchinim resident Nevis Rebello, said the state should not hold the ZP polls for at least three months. “It did not make any sense to postpone the elections by just two days,” Rebello said.

President of Goa Senior Citizens’ Federation, Diogo M Da Costa, said that though the federation had not given any instructions to its members over the ZP polls, the PM had stated that citizens should come out of their homes only in case of an exceptional situation.

“If the government had decided to go ahead with the polls, we can only trust it had made certain arrangements to hold the elections under such great odds. We have even kept our federation office closed till March 31,” Costa said.

421,['21/03/2020'],Nirbhaya case: Pawan hangs it a notch higher than predecessors,"Pawan Jallad (Pune Mirror)

NEW DELHI/MEERUT: Pawan Jallad , 57, has become the only hangman in the history of the country to execute four convicts in one go. Incidentally, these were his maiden executions. Pawan, a fourth-generation hangman from Meerut, missed an “opportunity” four years ago when high court commuted Surinder Koli’s death sentence to life imprisonment in the Nithari case.

Following the hanging of four Nirbhaya convicts in Tihar Jail at dawn on Friday, Pawan said, “For the first time in my life, I'm happy to execute four convicts. I had been waiting for this day for long. I thank God and the Tihar jail administration.”

The hanging, which was scheduled to take place on January 22, was deferred multiple times before it finally took place on March 20. According to UP jail officials in Meerut, a team from Tihar Jail administration had come down to the district on March 17 to take Pawan to Delhi for the preparations of the hanging.

Prison authorities in Uttar Pradesh have two hangmen, one in Meerut and the other in Lucknow, on retainership basis. Tihar administration had earlier this year written to UP jail administration requesting services of a hangman. Pawan, who gets a monthly stipend of Rs 5,000, was chosen for the job.

He has never imagined being anything else and has wanted to be a hangman since he was a child. Pawan has witnessed hanging since he was an adolescent. His great grandfather Laxman and grandfather Kallu were assigned the job of executing Indira Gandhi's assassins in 1989 and he took over after their passing away. Kallu had hanged dreaded criminals Ranga and Billa too. His father Mammu was the state hangman for 47 years till he died on May 19, 2011.

Pawan lives on the outskirts of Meerut and does not socialize much. His family comprises seven members and Pawan said that his son does not wish to follow in his footsteps. He is preparing for a government job and does not want to work at the gallows.

424,['21/03/2020'],Delhi: Gruesome crime that made rape punishable by death,"People celebrate outside Tihar Jail

NEW DELHI: Death penalty for rapists who brutalise their victim, full trial as adults for juveniles accused of heinous offences and fast-track courts for speedy trial in sexual assault cases — these are some of the far-reaching changes made in the country’s criminal law following a unprecedented public outrage over the horrific gang rape of Nirbhaya on December 16, 2012.

As protesters took to the street on rising crimes against women, the Centre set up a three-member committee under former Chief Justice of India J S Verma to propose changes in law to curb sexual offences. Accepting some of the recommendations, the government tightened laws dealing with sexual offences against women and brought in the Criminal Law (Amendment) Act, 2013 that provided a rigorous life term and a death term for rape convicts.

Till the Nirbhaya incident happened, offences such as acid attacks, stalking and voyeurism were seen as lesser crimes, but the amendments included stringent punishments even for these. For the first time, stalking and voyeurism were made non-bailable offences if repeated for a second time, while perpetrators of acid attacks now attract a 10-year jail.

The new law expanded the definition of rape and made it a graded offence. A minimum jail term of seven years may now be extend to imprisonment for natural life and a fine for rapist if he is found to be a police officer, public servant, armed forces personnel or management or hospital staff.

Similarly, it also changed various sections of the Indian Penal Code (IPC), Code of Criminal Procedure, Indian Evidence Act and the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, and provided for handing out death sentence to serial offenders.

The stringent amendments, which came into force on April 3, 2013, altered the definition of rape under IPC 375 and introduced harsher penalty in line with the gravity of offence.

Although the committee had opposed death penalty for rapists and advised life term, the government brought in a new section, 376A, to IPC that introduced death penalty. Under it, if an offender committing sexual assault inflicts an injury that causes death of the victim or renders her into a persistent vegetative state, the convict will be punished with rigorous imprisonment for a term that will not be less than 20 years, which may extend to life imprisonment meaning the remainder of a convict’s natural life, or death.

All hospitals now also face punishment if they fail to immediately provide first aid and/or medical treatment free of cost to the survivors of acid attack or rape.

Despite calls for tightening the juvenile offender laws, the committee, in its 630-page report, didn’t suggest any change in minimum age but Parliament in 2015 introduced the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, allowing the courts to try juveniles involved in heinous offences as adults.

Following the report, issued on January 23, 2013, the age of consent was made uniform. However, instead of the suggested 16 years, the government fixed it at 18, which means any sexual activity, irrespective of consent, with a woman below the age of 18 is statutory rape as she is a minor.

Perhaps the most controversial change, suggested by the Verma committee and overlooked by the government, was on marital rape. The panel had opined that the law must “specify that a marital or other relationship between the perpetrator and the victim is not a valid defence against the crimes of rape or sexual violation”.

(The victim's identity has not been revealed to protect her privacy as per Supreme court directives on cases related to sexual assault)

NAGPUR: The quarantined facility at MLA hostel received 14 new patients on Friday. All of them were sent for a mandatory 48 hours quarantine after which they would be offered a choice to go home for self-quarantine or stay on the premises.

According to sub-divisional officer Shekhar Ghadge , who is looking after the temporarily built facility, all 14 of them arrived in a Qatar Airways flight. “We will retain the senior citizens for 14 days, as per the government’s orders. Other would be provided choice of home quarantine after two days,” he told TOI.

Other officials informed that 25 international flyers were released for home quarantine after their 48 hours mandatory stay ended. “In total, we’ve released 39 flyers after this facility was set up about a week back. Most of them are students or IT professionals. One of them was admitted after his condition deteriorated, but now he’s fine. So far 65, flyers have been brought in this facility from the airport since beginning,” they said.

After rap from the Nagpur bench of Bombay high court, the administration started a police check post and also improved on its facilities to be offered to the visitors. Even Wi-Fi kits were provided to the occupants so that they could continue their official work.

The SDO informed that they would get more flyers after Friday midnight through Air Arabia ’s Sharjah flight. But number of passengers is reducing with each passing day. From Sunday, the government of India has banned all international flights, so their numbers wouldn’t increase after that, at least for a week.

“We’re allowing them to leave after stamping on their hands and also explaining them the procedure on how to go for a self-quarantine. If they flout rules, they could be punished,” Ghadge said.

The administration has already been offering facility to flyers to reach their homes in government vehicles only to stop spread of virus to cab drivers and others. They’re not allowed to use any public transport. “If flyers are found with slightest of symptoms, they are straightway taken to Indira Gandhi Government Medical College and Hospital (IGGMCH) for tests,” the officials informed.

Lucknow: With chief minister Yogi Adityanath having appealed to people to perform puja during Navaratra at their homes and avoid religious gatherings, district authorities in Ayodhya expect the Ram Navami snan and mela at Saryu river in Ayodhya on April 2 would remain a low-key affair. Navaratra begins on March 25.

Amid concerns over the possibility of a large gathering on the occasion like previous years, a government spokesperson said the Ram Navami snaan was not organised by the state administration like Kumbh Mela and the district authorities only take care of the crowd management.

Additional chief secretary (home) Awanish Awasthi said the chief minister had already directed all district magistrates to reach out to religious heads and ask them to postpone all religious congregations.

Sources in the government said, the border of Ayodhya district might be sealed on Ram Navami to restrict crowds from outside. This apart, the administration may implement social distancing and allow a maximum of five people to move together in a group.

“As it is people are not venturing out. The prime minister and the chief minister have appealed to people not to venture out of their homes unless it is unavoidable. Under such a situation, it should not be a problem if we restrict snan for locals only,” said a senior official privy to crowd control arrangements under way in Ayodhya.

Mahant Dinendra Das of Nirhmohi Akhara said every year a meeting of seers is held to finalise the schedule and events of the snaan and Ram Navmi Mela, but this year the meeting has not taken place as it will lead to a gathering that may not be the right thing to do under the virus scare.

“There is hardly any preparation in place for the mela and snan. Only a few barricades have come up so far. It is unlikely that any crowd would gather,” said Mahant Girish Pati Tripathi, head priest of Tewari Mandir near Tulsi Udyan in Ayodhya.

Some seers, however, suggested that apart from a general appeal to stop religious gatherings, a specific appeal about Ram Navami Mela should be made. Acharya Satyendra Das, the chief priest of Ram Janmabhoomi Temple said: ""The administration must make announcement about the cancellation.”

Mahant Dinendra Das, the chief priest of Nirmohi Akhada and Trustee of Ram Mandir Trust, said: “Being the matter related to Lord Rama, it is also necessary to save the society from the threat and that is the responsibility of the government. In the interest of nation and the security of people I have have no objection if the administration decide to stop the mela.

Mahant Yugal Kishor Sharan Shastri , chief priest of Saryu Kunj Temple the temple adjacent to Ramjanmabhoomi premises said, it is a big threat of coronavirus around us, the local administration minimised the gatherings in court offices and the district magistrate cancelled his meeting with public so the Ram Navami Mela must be immediately stopped and cancelled.

JAIPUR: Contrary to the orders issued by chief minister Ashok Gehlot for partial shutdown , the Directorate of Secondary Education, Bikaner has issued a new circular highlighting the important work government teachers are supposed to do in schools, at the time when classes have been suspended due to the pandemic. The circular also says action shall be taken against teachers who defy this norm.

Teachers from government schools across the state have been complaining about the risk they have been taking while coming to school at the time when classes and exams have been suspended. Teachers seem to have no work in schools, but the government is adamant in this regard.

Director secondary education, Sourabh Swami said, “The orders for partial shutdown are for government offices and not for schools. Teachers working at the district education office and other places will follow partial shutdown. But teachers have to come to schools.”

As per the directions issued by the government, teachers have to be present in the school and they can be involved in data updating at Shala Darpan portal, accounts work update, preparing registers of Bhamashah, maintaining cash book at schools, among other work.

Teachers can review one book as per their interest and can send the write-up of the review to the chief district education officer. Their write-up if selected can be published in ‘Shivira’ monthly magazine published by the Directorate of Education in Bikaner. Top three write-ups will be awarded by the government later.

Meanwhile, district education officer at Kota issued orders for 50 per cent school teachers to be present in government schools. When the situation became clear, authorities in Kota withdrew the orders stating that 50% shutdown is not applicable for teachers and they have to come to school.

Teachers, however, did not appreciate the idea and maintained that when all other departments are observing partial shutdown, then why do they have to go to schools without any work. The department has no answer on it as yet.

431,['21/03/2020'],"With weekly Friday market called off, Mapusa wears deserted look","The few vendors that turned up were not aware that the government had called off the Friday market

MAPUSA: Perhaps for the first time in recent years, Mapusa’s weekly Friday market had a poor attendance, with the government suspending all weekly markets till March 31. The tourist favourite seemed like any other market day, albeit with even fewer people. The Mapusa market has grown bigger in terms of stalls and footfalls, while its geographical area has remained static, making it a highly congested place on the weekly market day.

Suspension of the market helped to avoid crowding, and for a change, people were able to walk without bumping into other shoppers.

The inner lanes of the market which are usually packed with vendors and milling with hundreds of customers, were empty.

A majority of vendors did not turn up, and the few that did, like the woimen from neighbouring villages that sell their hand-woven bamboo baskets, said they were unaware that the market had been called off, and decided to stay put. With no buyers, they sat in a group, talking.

“There are few customers today. I didn’t know that the weekly market was suspended. We have decided to wait for few hours and then go home,” said Meenakshi from Aldona who has been a regular at the Mapusa Friday market for the past fifteen years .

Nataline, 60, who sells garden plants, was in the market in her usual spot, oblivious to the fact that the weekly market day had been suspended till March 31. It was not a bad day for her as she still managed to sell some plants.

“I sold eight plants. Let’s see if I can find buyers for the remaining three by evening,” she said. She also sported a face mask she bought for Rs 30.

A few foreigners, who are yet to return to their home countries, were seen shopping. Locals say foreigners mostly purchase garments at Mapusa market, including silk material. Some of the clothes shops have silk stocked only for foreigners.

Besides local varieties of vegetables and pulses, the number of stalls selling readymade garments, cell phone covers, toys and other trinkets have increased in recent years, leaving no space to move about. On Fridays, the market is crammed with vendors selling garden plants, local variety of mangoes and wooden furniture, amid scooters parked on both sides. Today was an exception.

With the regular weekly vendors missing in action, others conducted their business as usual, like Ramesh from Parra , who sets up a stall at the market everyday to sell metal jewellery.

“There are few people in the market today and fewer foreigners. I can’t rely on foreigners alone,” he said. He hoped business will pick up later in the day.

Though the market didn’t have its usual crowd, two to three persons were seen selling face masks of questionable quality, confident that the coronavirus threat will ensure they exhaust their stock by the end of the day.

The move comes after a public outcry over the insensitiveness shown by Sawant and his government by risking people’s lives in the midst of one of the worst pandemic that the world has seen and a strong rebuke from the high court hearing a public interest litigation calling for the postponement of the polls due to the threat posed by Covid-19 Sawant, who has all along maintained that there was no threat to people from Covid-19 in Goa and had been attending large gatherings shunning even the advice of PM Narendra Modi on the cruciality of social distancing, suddenly seemed to have realised that “the health of the people is more important than holding elections”.The state election commissioner R K Srivastava told TOI the government would notify the new date for polling in consultation with the commission.“The new notification will only consist of the date of election and counting. There will be no more campaigning,” Sawant said.On Thursday, the chief minister had said the government had decided to postpone the polls by two days after Modi called for a ‘Janata Curfew’ from 7am to 9pm on Sunday.But the HC , hearing the PIL, said: “At least, prima facie, postponing the elections symbolically from March 22 to March 24, is paying mere lip service to the call given by the Prime Minister to combat the Covid-19 spread.”On Friday, Sawant made another attempt to take the credit for postponing the polls by invoking Modi’s advice of maintaining social distancing, but earlier in the day, the two-judge bench of justices M S Sonak and M S Jawalkar had clearly stated that “the fact that there is uncertainty as to when this phase will pass, at least prima facie, is no good ground to proceed without the SEC genuinely applying its mind to the issue as to whether holding of polls is conducive on March 24, when the directives, advisories, medical and scientific literature refer to this phase as the exponential phase and advises moving outdoors, only if absolutely necessary.”The HC also castigated the SEC and said it cannot “abdicate its power and thereby shirk from discharging its responsibility”.Ultimately, democracy is a government of the people, by the people and for people. “Therefore, even in compliance with the democratic principle of holding timely elections, the lives of the voters cannot be put to stake,” the court said.Considering half of Goa population of around 8.13 lakh voters, 1,210 polling booths, 10,000 polling staff and 500-700 voters in enlisted in each polling booth in rural areas, the court said that at least prima facie, “we fail to see how the entire exercise involving almost half the population of state of Goa does not constitute mass gathering which, the directives issued by the central and the state governments and WHO seeks to regulate”.The government last month had postponed the election date from March 15 to March 22. The last ZP polls were held on March 18, 2015, and the first meeting was conducted on March 25 that year.“The five-year tenure ends on March 24. We have to constitute ZPs before that,” Srivastava had told reporters last month.",goa,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-47529300,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-110164,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/after-public-furore-hc-rap-sawant-postpones-zp-polls/articleshow/74739687.cms

NAGPUR: Around 15 women, with their faces covered with masks, sat on a pavement in front of the MLA Hostel block where the quarantined flyers have been housed. They were waiting for permission to enter the block for cleaning work.

They are contractual workers deployed to clean the MLA Hostel buildings and rooms. As each of them slowly opened up on being questioned, they asked was it really necessary for them to go into the rooms. “Initially, they asked us to go just like that, but when we insisted for safety kits, they were finally provided,” said one of the women.

“Even with the protective gear, we are still scared of going inside. The rooms are not too big and can be cleaned up by the occupants themselves. However, they also leave the empty food packets just like that,” said one of them not wishing to be named.

“The empty food packets are left in the corridor. The occupants can put it in the dustbin. Instead they order us to clean it when we ask them to dispose it on their own,” said a worker. Other officials managing facility also agreed that at least the room can be cleaned by the occupants.

The workers said they are given Rs6,000 a month and have been promised extra for providing services to the quarantined flyers. Their supervisor quickly said that it was Rs7,000 while the contractor, Vicky Jain , claimed they are paid Rs12,000.

Jain said when he saw that doctors are going inside with protective gear, he insisted that his workers too should get the facility, which was provided. “My team used to earlier work in the Mayo Hospital and only the trained staff goes inside the rooms,” he said.

“Once they come out of the room, facilities of washing their person and preventive gear has also been arranged. We ensure that the workers are safe,” he said.

436,['21/03/2020'],"Nagpur: NIT warns of cancelling lease of 78 plots, including 8 of metro","NAGPUR: The Nagpur Improvement Trust (NIT) has issued a public notice warning of cancelling the lease of 78 plots, including eight of MahaMetro, if the ground rent arrears are not paid by March 31. The civic agency is yet to be dissolved and depends on revenue collected from ground rent.

On Thursday, NIT issued the public notice with the names of leaseholders and outstanding arrears of 78 plots. “NIT is in existence. All leaseholders of NIT plots are requested to pay the annual ground rent. As per the terms and conditions of the lease, NIT will cancel the lease of plots in arrears of over Rs5 lakh,” NIT said.

The NIT has over 68,000 leasehold plots under its control. Barring a few, NIT leasehold plots comprise flat schemes, commercial complexes etc. NIT had also leased its plots to MahaMetro for construction of stations and allied services.

It is mandatory for leaseholders to pay annual ground rent of 2% of the total value of the plots. Many of NIT’s leaseholders stopped paying ground rent since last year. The state government had started the process to dissolve NIT in August last year. The government had taken away powers of the planning authority of NIT and transferred it to the Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC). The government did not dissolve the NIT totally. The plan was to dissolve NIT completely and distribute its properties, manpower and liabilities between the NMC and Nagpur Metropolitan Region Development Authority (NMRDA). But the process got stuck with assembly elections followed by uncertainty in government formation.

The Maha Vikas Aghadi government started the process to give back planning authority status of Gunthewari areas to the NIT. The NIT is now reportedly left with only revenue from ground rent.

“Revenue from the annual ground rent is around Rs15 crore. Arrears are around Rs28 crore. This is the only available option for salaries and other liabilities of NIT. Therefore, recovery of ground rent is being taken seriously,” an NIT official told TOI.

The NIT had approved a one-time settlement scheme for ground rent two years ago but did not implement it. It also did not follow the government’s policy to give freehold status to leaseholders by taking one time premium.

As per the NIT notice, MahaMetro owes around Rs5.46 crore in arrears. “Our application for permanent transfer of land is pending with the government. NIT is a partner and also a stake holder in the Metro Rail project. NIT also owes dues to MahaMetro as per Metro Rail project’s detailed report,” said MahaMetro.

Some of the other leaseholders mentioned in list of 78 are Rai Udyog, Mahalaxmi Builders, Anil Industries, Prince Builders, Chirag Industries, The Tribal Research and Training Institute , RTO, WCL, Vidarbha Premier Housing Society , police department etc

Social distancing is the key to break the spread of the virus and the statewide lockdown will be put to the test during these days, experts say.Health department officials fear social interactions by those who should remain in home isolation could undermine efforts of the government. A top bureaucrat said though the upcoming weekend closure is required, the tempo needs to be sustained. “But our concern is after the Sunday shutdown, people should not take to the streets in large numbers the next day,” he added.Dr V Ravi, professor and head, department of neurovirology , Nimhans, said Karnataka’s preparations kicked in much earlier than during previous viral outbreaks.“This is the first time we prepared early,” Ravi said. “How effective the measures will be is everybody’s responsibility and not the government's alone. Unless people own responsibility, we cannot be assured that the state would overcome the situation. People must avoid crowding and not go out when not required.”Health and family welfare department officials are holding confabulations on the way ahead to contain the spread of the virus. “So far, there have not been cases of community spread,” an official said. “But we need to make sure we overcome the problems at the earliest. All those who have come from abroad and primary and secondary contacts of persons who test positive must stay put and behave responsibly.”A senior official with the department said stamping on hands of those returning from abroad should have been started earlier for better impact. “Now that we have not done it, we should ideally be going in search of all those 42,000 persons who returned to Karnataka in the last 14 days and stamp their hands. That's to make sure they remain in home isolation and do not step out. But this is a mammoth task. It’s virtually impossible to do,” he said.Health experts reiterate the need of the hour is to remain at home and not to venture outside. “However tempting it may be to travel around, it is more important to help oneself and everyone around by staying at home this weekend.

BHOPAL: Celebrations broke out in the BJP camp soon after Kamal Nath resigned as chief minister. Hundreds of party workers thronged the BJP HQ in Bhopal on Friday afternoon, disregarding PM Narendra Modi’s advice to avoid crowds in view of the Coronavirus scare.

BJP vice-president Shivraj Singh Chouhan, who is believe to be in line for a fourth term as CM, shared sweets with state party chief V D Sharma, LOP Gopal Bhargava and several MLAs.

“If a government topples due to its own internal conflict, then we can’t do anything. You can see that we were not in the game to form or topple a government. They (Congress) should introspect on what led to this situation,” said Chouhan. A celebratory dinner was planned at his residence but it was cancelled as a ‘precaution against Covid-19.

“PM Narendra Modi has sounded the alert to desist from holding mass gatherings by BJP workers. In view of the warning and Coronavirus alert, I have cancelled the dinner hosted for BJP MLAs and leaders at my residence,” said Chouhan.

Union minister Narendra Singh Tomar is likely to arrive in Bhopal to discuss the next plan of action. Tomar said that the Congress government collapsed “on its own due to internal disputes”.

Chouhan, Sharma and Bhargava joined senior party colleagues Vinay Sahastrabuddhe and Kailash Vijayvargiya to garland the busts of party ideologues Pt Deendayal Upadhyay, Kushabhau Thakre and Vijayaraje Scindia.

“The government failed to satisfy its own ministers and MLAs. The smoke has finally cleared from the political arena,” said Bhargava. Sharma also hit out at Congress and said, “When Supreme Court ordered a floor test, the CM fled the battle. The Congress government collapsed on its own and relieved the public.”

Former Union minister Jyotiraditya Scindia, whose shock defection led to the collapse of the Congress government, said it was a victory of the people. “I have always believed that politics should be a medium of public service, but the state government had deviated from this path. Truth has won again. Satyamev Jayate,” he said.

Earlier in the day, BJP held a legislative party meeting at a Sehore resort to prepare for the floor test. Chouhan said that BJP MLAs will gather at Vidhan Sabha as per the directives of Supreme Court. However, Nath’s resignation came ahead of the trust vote.

Sources said that ahead of formation of BJP government, Independent MLAs and former minister Pradeep Jaiswal, two BSP and one SP MLAs have also extended their support to BJP. Independent MLAs Surendra Singh Shera also met BJP leader Narottam Mishra after the resignation of Kamal Nath.

PATNA: Unidentified criminals looted Rs20 lakh from a private bank after shooting at the security guard in Muzaffarpur district on Friday. The incident is close on the heels of the daring robbery in a nationalized bank under Paroo police station in the district on Wednesday.

Police said five criminals on two motorbikes reached Maithi branch of Axis Bank under Gaighat police station around 1.15pm and looted the amount from the cash counter after holding the staff and customers captive at gunpoint. One of the robbers had covered his face with helmet.

The robbers, stated to be in the age group of 25 and 30 years, stuffed the cash in a plastic bag and escaped after shooting at the security guard, Mithu Singh. Mithu, a resident of Mohanpur village under Bochaha police station in Muzaffarpur district, suffered injuries in his stomach.

The robbers also assaulted bank employee Sunil Kumar with revolver butt when he resisted the loot. Branch manager Nitish Kumar informed the Gaighat police about the incident when the robbers fled with the cash.

Both Mithu and Sunil were rushed to the SKMCH for treatment. On getting information, SSP Jayant Kant along with City SP Neeraj Kumar Singh reached the spot and inquired about the robbery. “The identity of the criminals is being ascertained with the help of CCTV footage obtained from the bank. The actual amount looted is Rs11.85 lakh,” Neeraj said.

The locals later told the investigating officers that the robbers escaped towards Bochaha after committing the crime.

This is the third incident of bank robbery in Muzaffarpur and Vaishali districts in the last one week. On March 18, a gang of armed criminals had looted Rs8.80 lakh from Uttar Bihar Grameen Bank at Ghataro under Kartaha police station in Vaishali district. Earlier, Rs2.53 lakh was looted from Lalu Chhapra branch of the SBI under Paroo police station in Muzaffarpur district on March 17. “Frequent incidents of bank robbery have exposed policing in the two neighbouring districts,” said an RJD leader from Vaishali, Nekh Mohammad.

NASHIK: The Nashik Municipal Corporation ( NMC ) and the Nashik Municipal Smart City Development Corporation Ltd (NMSCDCL) heaved a sigh of relief after they received Rs 296.93 crore and Rs 14.71 crore respectively which was stuck in Yes Bank following the restrictions imposed by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI).

Subsequently, the municipal corporation and the smart city body transferred their money from Yes Bank to the State Bank of India.

The RBI had placed the bank under a moratorium in the first week of March, capping maximum withdrawals at Rs 50,000 per account for a month.

Municipal commissioner Radhakrishna Game had already sent a letter to the bank for retrieving their money.

“After RBI lifted restrictions on the bank from Wednesday evening, NMC officials were in the bank to get the money. They also followed up with the bank on Thursday. Finally, they got the money transferred to SBI,” a top NMC official said.

In October last year, the municipal commissioner had already given instructions to the Chief Accounts & Finance officer (CAFO) and chief accounts officer of the smart city to withdraw money from Yes Bank and transfer it to nationalised banks.

Accordingly, the smart city had withdrawn over Rs 400 crore, but NMC’s CAFO failed to withdraw the their share from the private bank.

Since the civic body’s CAFO did not withdraw the money from Yes Bank despite instructions, the municipal commissioner had sent a show cause notice to him and six other officials from finance department of the NMC.

Earlier, restrictions were imposed on Yes Bank until April 3, but were later lifted on March 18.

This had forced the NMC to stop its online services such as property and water taxes. The municipal corporation had a tie up with Yes Bank and all online payments involving taxes were deposited in its account in the said bank.

MADURAI: Considering the intensity of Covid-19 outbreak, the indefinite protest against CAA, NRC and NPR was suspended on the 36th day on Friday. One of the organisers and Madurai district president of the Tamilnadu Muslim Munnetra Kazhagam (TMMK), S Sheik Ibrahim said the protest will resume after Covid-19 is brought under control.

Organisers refuted that ending the protest had anything to do with the Madras high court order against such protests on Friday. A division bench of justice M M Sundresh and justice Krishnan Ramaswamy in their interim order while hearing a batch of pleas to stall protests in the state had said that no protests and mass gatherings, including anti-CAA agitations, can be permitted across Tamil Nadu till Covid-19 outbreak is contained.

“Decision to suspend the protest was taken on Thursday night considering the Covid-19 situation as others should not be affected by us. We also took into consideration the role we have to play to prevent the virus and have decided to extend full support to the governments to curb the deadly virus,” Ibrahim said.

The protest ended with a rally in which nearly 4,000 women and representatives of various Muslim bodies and political parties participated. The rally that began at ‘Shaheen Bagh’ in Mahaboopalayam created awareness on Covid-19 apart from sloganeering against CAA, NRC and NPR.

“There was no pressure from the police as the protest was organised with permission. We withdrew voluntarily,” Ibrahim said.

Representatives of Manithaneya Makkal Katchi, Social Democratic Party of India, Communist Part of India (Marxist) and Viduthalai Chiruthaigal Katchi participated in the rally on Friday.

Most protests across the state concluded on Monday following the state government’s order on social distancing due to Covid-19.

On Wednesday, the Tamil Nadu Thowheed Jamath (TNTJ) organised a prison filling protest against CAA, NPR and NRC. A case was registered against nearly 2,100 of them who took part in the protest at Kadayanallur in Tenkasi district on Wednesday.

Two shack owners who began dismantling their structures in Cavelossim on Wednesday, said that one of the primary reasons for the early closure is the drastic fall in tourist footfalls due to the Covid-19 pandemic. James Baretto, who is shutting down his shack, restaurant and hotel, said that industry stakeholders are affected as tourists from across the world have been banned from entering the country due to the virus.“Also, the staff has to clean chairs and tables, wash cutlery and crockery and serve the guests. Such close contact and intermingling with tourists is risky for our workers.

456,['21/03/2020'],Madhya Pradesh debacle a big blow to Congress ‘old guard’,"NEW DELHI: The loss of Congress government in Madhya Pradesh marks a major setback for the opposition party for whom states were proving islands of power and solace in the wake of its near decimation at the national level.

Significantly, for the government which came to power 15 months ago after a wait of 15 years, the swift collapse marks a mortal embarrassment for the Congress “old guard” which was in-charge of the regime in the form of weathered warhorses Kamal Nath and Digvijaya Singh . In the generational battle that has gripped the party and left it rudderless, the “old guard” has prided itself for its political management which it has found lacking in the GenNext. The fall of the Nath regime has implications for internal organisational wrangling as Rahul Gandhi refuses to take back his resignation as party chief.

Facing a drought of victory after its rout in 2014 elections, Congress wrested a hat-trick of victory over BJP in MP, Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh in December 2018. That they were BJP strongholds boosted the party morale besides the fact that it massively shrunk the saffron footprint nationally. Now, the soft dismissal in the heartland state is rankling the insiders no end.

The addition of three states to Punjab and Puducherry, coupled with the newly-acquired coalition regimes in Maharashtra and Jharkhand , provided the much-needed lifeline to demoralised Congress workers and the leadership alike. Leaders underline how Rahul Gandhi’s “yuva aakrosh rallies” post-2019 were held and were being planned in these states.

“If we are not able to consolidate power, we will be left with nothing. It is as much because of our political failure as it is owing to complete absence of leadership. There is no communication with the Gandhis,” an angry senior Congress functionary said.

The systemic disarray is highlighted by the fact that over 20 party MLAs crossed over to rival BJP in MP, close on the heels of desertion by a similar flock in Karnataka which brought down Congress’s alliance government with JD(S).

As Bhopal disaster left Congress licking its wounds, fingers were being pointed at veterans Kamal Nath and Digvijaya Singh, who together came to be known as the ruling camp of state Congress and whose dominance is blamed for Jyotiraditya Scindia’s decision to cross over to BJP.

Scindia, whom Rahul Gandhi has publicly called his friend and college mate, was at daggers drawn with the Nath-Singh duo because he was shut out of the state, a feeling exacerbated by the fact that sons of both the leaders have been blooded in MP politics.

While Rahul failed to ensure loyalty of his GenNext friend, it is a fact that he had left the management of MP unit to the old guard. That they had no clue that Scindia could remorselessly effect an ideological conversion along with 20-plus MLAs, puts a serious question mark on their famed management skills.

“If veterans are intolerant of young leadership and also incapable of steering a government, then what are they good at, what are they seeking the reins for,” was the refrain in Congress after Nath meekly tendered his resignation to avoid the floor test.

There is anger that overconfidence of these leaders denied ministries to allies and independents, which is the basic drill in a regime with wafer-thin majority. Also, corporations and other offices, which are used to accommodate MLAs, were not filled, while a good number of senior MLAs were angry at being left out right from the start. It all contributed to the fall that was not anticipated.

The fall of the Nath regime has implications for internal organisational wrangling as Rahul Gandhi refuses to take back his resignation as party chief.Facing a drought of victory after its rout in 2014 elections, Congress wrested a hat-trick of victory over BJP in MP, Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh in December 2018. That they were BJP strongholds boosted the party morale besides the fact that it massively shrunk the saffron footprint nationally. Now, the soft dismissal in the heartland state is rankling the insiders no end.The addition of three states to Punjab and Puducherry, coupled with the newly-acquired coalition regimes in Maharashtra and Jharkhand , provided the much-needed lifeline to demoralised Congress workers and the leadership alike. Leaders underline how Rahul Gandhi’s “yuva aakrosh rallies” post-2019 were held and were being planned in these states.“If we are not able to consolidate power, we will be left with nothing. It is as much because of our political failure as it is owing to complete absence of leadership. There is no communication with the Gandhis,” an angry senior Congress functionary said.The systemic disarray is highlighted by the fact that over 20 party MLAs crossed over to rival BJP in MP, close on the heels of desertion by a similar flock in Karnataka which brought down Congress’s alliance government with JD(S).As Bhopal disaster left Congress licking its wounds, fingers were being pointed at veterans Kamal Nath and Digvijaya Singh, who together came to be known as the ruling camp of state Congress and whose dominance is blamed for Jyotiraditya Scindia’s decision to cross over to BJP.Scindia, whom Rahul Gandhi has publicly called his friend and college mate, was at daggers drawn with the Nath-Singh duo because he was shut out of the state, a feeling exacerbated by the fact that sons of both the leaders have been blooded in MP politics.While Rahul failed to ensure loyalty of his GenNext friend, it is a fact that he had left the management of MP unit to the old guard. That they had no clue that Scindia could remorselessly effect an ideological conversion along with 20-plus MLAs, puts a serious question mark on their famed management skills.“If veterans are intolerant of young leadership and also incapable of steering a government, then what are they good at, what are they seeking the reins for,” was the refrain in Congress after Nath meekly tendered his resignation to avoid the floor test.There is anger that overconfidence of these leaders denied ministries to allies and independents, which is the basic drill in a regime with wafer-thin majority. Also, corporations and other offices, which are used to accommodate MLAs, were not filled, while a good number of senior MLAs were angry at being left out right from the start. It all contributed to the fall that was not anticipated.",politics,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74741773,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-92888,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//politics/news/mp-debacle-a-big-blow-to-cong-old-guard/articleshow/74741775.cms
458,['21/03/2020'],climate justice: #DigitalStrike: The world takes the climate fight online,"The race to ‘flatten the curve’ of coronavirus cases is at the forefront globally. But though the pandemic has affected the way things normally function, fighting climate change has not taken a backseat, as activists have come up with an alternative that avoids mass gatherings, but still reaches the masses.Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg recently urged people to take to social media. “You can join the #DigitalStrike for upcoming Fridays – post a photo of you striking with a sign and use the hashtag #ClimateStrikeOnline! #fridaysforfuture #climatestrike #schoolstrike4climate,” read her Twitter post. “For now (of course depending on where you live) we’ll have to find new ways to create public awareness and advocate for change that don’t involve too big crowds – listen to local authorities,” she said further.Soon after, thousands of people from across the globe joined her, posting pictures on social media. Closer home, too, climate activists connected online for the digital strikes. “The pandemic has taught us the strength of social media, throwing more light on the cause as most people are making use of social media to remain updated,” shares Radhika Mohod, one of the organisers of Fridays For Future strikes in Pune. She expresses, “While we are confined to four walls, we are making the most by painting placards and posters with climate messages and posting them on various social media handles using hashtags like #DigitalStrike #ClimateStrikeOnline, among others and tagging the FFF social media pages. It has not only attracted global activists on Friday, but also gained momentum on the following days too.”As the digital strike in India started attracting youngsters in large numbers, innovative ways to connect to activists globally has also been on the rise. Tarun Mediratta, a hospitality student from Mumbai and a climate crises activist, expresses, “Since we are at home, we have enough time to make the strike interactive. Besides posting pictures of ourselves at home with placards, we are also going to have interactive content going on our Instagram pages – a climate quiz! We have planned to have webinars and educational calls on climate action. Our team is also going to be spending a lot of time in creating small short films/documentaries for people to understand how serious this issue is.”This week’s climate strike is significant because they are supporting Polluters Out – a youth group pushing for divestment from fossil fuels. “This Friday (March 20) with the theme ‘environmental sensitization’ we flooded United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change with mentions demanding rejection of funding from fossil fuel companies,” shares Bangalore-based climate activist Disha Ravi. The national coordinator of Fridays For Future strikes, she further elaborates, “We posted 10 tweets every two hours to get their attention. Climate activists from across India also shared impactful stories and the effects of climate change – primarily caused by the fossil fuel industry – on their respective regions.”Additionally, the digital strike included a profile picture campaign where all the participants changed their social media profile pictures to three grey arrows. Ashiq Rahman, an undergraduate student from Delhi University explains, “This ensured we stand together in what we believe in, even if it’s not physically possible.”Since people across the world are glued to their mobile screens now, drawing attention is easier, echo online activists. Guwahati-based climate activist and graduate student Shivani Goyal, quips, “Digital strikes are able to reach mass audiences globally, because of the Twitter storms and other online campaigns that we have taken to social media. All the world leaders at present are available on social media and it has been easier to grab their attention.”Mitzi Jonelle Tan, a climate activist from Youth Advocates for Climate Action Philippines, expresses, “Digital strikes are a good way to maintain momentum during this time of quarantine. It is a reminder to everyone that no matter what obstacles we face, we will continue to demand first world countries that are contributing the most to the climate crisis to take up the greater responsibility to solve the crisis. We will continue to strike for climate justice even if we are confined to our homes.”Echoing Mitzi’s thoughts, Olé Müller, a student from Zürich, Switzerland adds, “The corona crisis has many parallels to the climate crisis. Politicians acted too late because they were afraid of the economic repercussions. They are doing the same with the climate crisis. We have to act against the climate crisis with the impulse we saw now against the virus. Through digital strikes, we can reach politicians and businesses and get them to act on climate just as much as they are acting on Coronavirus.” The phone does not transmit viruses, only ideas, Müller finishes.",life-style,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74730952,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-792003/74730952.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//life-style/spotlight/digitalstrike-the-world-takes-the-climate-fight-online/articleshow/74730952.cms

Vijayawada: The increasing number of suspected Covid-19 cases and fear fuelled by social media rumours has led to panic-buying among residents of Vijayawada. Supermarkets in the city are witnessing a huge inflow of customers trying to stock up.

Under the circumstances, a popular supermarket chain is allowing only 200 customers at a time and has also introduced a token system. Customers are mostly stockpiling essential commodities such as rice, pulses, edible oils, milk and other staples items.

T Suryakantham, a homemaker who was spotted at a supermarket on Friday morning said that she usually purchases groceries in the first week of the month.

“But in the existing scenario, we don’t know what will happen tomorrow. Buying commodities at a time for the next few weeks will also help prevent contracting the virus,” she said.

Meanwhile, the state government has already closed parts and other places where people gather en masse including malls, cinema halls, gyms, swimming pools, amusement parks and places of worship. Residents feel that the government might impose a total shutdown in the worst-case scenario, which is leading them to buy essentials in bulk.

People are also thronging pharmacies. K Shiva Kumar, the owner of a pharmacy at MG Road said that people are buying basic medications for cough, cold, fever and body pain. “Besides, there is an increased demand for masks, sanitizers and liquid hand washes. The sale of over-the-counter medications has also gone up over the last few days,” Kumar said.

Rayi Kishore, owner of a departmental store in Bhavanipuram attempted to assuage fears. Kishore said that footfall has increased over the last week, while adding, “As per my knowledge, people do not need to panic over the situation. All supermarkets in the city have enough stocks.”

There were barely any customers at the several eateries on the street, many of which are immensely popular among the residents. In addition to restaurants, petrol bunks have sustained heavy losses in the past few days with reduced vehicular movement on the streets.Interestingly, despite an atmosphere of uncertain dread prevailing in the twin cities, most residents, in adherence to the directions and pleas of the district administration, and the state and central governments, refrained from crowding hospitals on Friday.The small businesses , however, are the ones affected the most because of the restrictions. Gauri Rajput, who runs a beauty parlour in Hubballi, said that she had had to shut her store for the past week owing to her clients refusing to turn up for fear of contracting the infection.Data with the Karnataka Petroleum Dealers’ Association shows that there are as many as 95 bunks across the twin cities, nearly all of which have registered a downturn in business in the past week.President of the association PS Mirjankar, who owns a petrol bunk in Hubballi, confirmed to TOI that the sale of petrol at his bunk had reduced to 2,500 litres per day, on average, in the past week, from 3,200 litres per day earlier. “Sale of diesel has also been affected at my bunk. Where I would sell 3,000 litres of diesel per day, the figure has fallen to 2,000 litres now,” he added.President of the Hubballi Autorickshaw Drivers and Owners’ Association Shekharayya Matpathi said that the novel coronavirus had made their life miserable. “Lack of business has compelled us to earn our living by working in construction, painting and other daily wage labour,” said Matpathi, adding that the drivers were unable to earn as little as Rs 50 riding autos every day.He said that he had only one ride on Friday, and all he could earn from that one was Rs 30.Meanwhile, with most people preferring to stay indoors and cook their own food, patronage of restaurants has fallen drastically.

This trend, however, is likely to help other regular hotels in the long run. They are hopeful that people's habit of eating from unhygienic roadside stalls may vanish even after corona is eradicated.In the past few years, many push-cart eateries have had set up stalls in the twin cities. Despite the pleas of restaurant owners having regular license, the authorities have failed to curb roadside eateries. The irony is that consumers were also encouraging them as they were getting food at a lower price compared to regular hotels. In the process, they forgot about the quality and hygiene at such eateries.Vinayak Kabadi, a private employee, said he had been consuming lunch from a mobile eatery on T B Road. “If we go to regular hotels, it takes 10-15 minutes extra than our eating time to get the items. However, I have shunned this habit after the Covid-19 outbreak. My parents are insisting me not to eat from here and there,” he said.Sharada Hallur, a homemaker in Shivagiri, Dharwad, said she was going out with family members on weekends. “We used to consume gobi manchurian or such items from mobile eateries just for taste. Now, I have decided not to visit such eateries in the near future in the wake of Covid-19 outbreak. I am preparing lunch box for my husband and college-going son, who have strictly shunned consuming food from hotels,” she said.She opined that Covid-19 has prompted her family members to take a look at hygiene in restaurants Krishna Marathe, owner of an eatery on Koppikar Road, said his business has been affected for the past one week. “If we dare to open the shop, we get very meagre business that is causing more loss for us. Though we put all efforts to maintain cleanliness, we cannot prevent dust which is common in all areas of the city. If people become more cautious about hygiene at such hotels, we will definitely look out for alternatives to meet our daily needs,” he said.A hotelier at Channamma Circle hoped that the awareness caused after Covid-19 outbreak will definitely turn an advantage for the regular industry.However, Rajendra Shetty, organising secretary, Hubballi Hotel Owners Association, differed, saying such consumers won’t come to regular hotels.“It’s true that the size of consumers at roadside eateries has drastically melted.

Dharwad APMC chairman Mahaveer Jain on Friday said that the three centres had been set up only after obtaining the government’s approval to purchase produce categorised under fair average quality (FAQ). The MSP for Bengal gram is Rs 4,875 per quintal, and each farmer who has registered himself or herself under the scheme can sell up to ten quintals. Jain said that as many 3,098 farmers had enrolled themselves under the scheme, of whom 1,136 were in Dharwad, 1,445 from Uppinabetageri and 917 from Hebballi. “We expect more farmers to enroll themselves under the scheme in the coming days. The government has set April 4 as the deadline for enrolment under the scheme, and procurement of Bengal gram will go on till April 22. Procurement of the crop is already under way, and we request farmers to ensure that they benefit from the scheme,” Jain added.

Queried on some of the issues that have cropped up following the use of GPC technology, Jain said that farmers had had to face problems owing to errors in identification of standing crops made by the technology. “This issue has been brought to the notice of the district administration, and a memorandum submitted to the Union ministry of agriculture, wherein we have asked them to initiate remedial measures,” he added.

Cattle market suspended

Against the backdrop of increasing restrictions to curb the Covid-19 menace, Jain said that he had not received instructions to shut the Dharwad APMC Yard, yet. “However, in keeping with the orders of the government on barring a large assembly of people, we have decided not to hold the weekly cattle market, which was scheduled on March 24 and March 31. We request farmers not to get their cattle here, and cooperate with us,” the Dharwad APMC chief said.

Hours after the Mandya DC issued an order shutting down all factories till March 31, he scrapped it and issued a fresh one, citing the state government ’s order allowing factories to function with some stipulations.Deputy commissioner MV Venkatesh’s first order was issued on March 19, instructing all factories to shut down till March 31 to prevent the spread of the coronavirus . Early Friday, he issued a modified order, saying factories could continue to function according to directives issued by the state government.The additional chief secretary’s order issued on Friday says garment factories should ensure that no one other than employees enters the units. Workers should not sit in groups and must maintain a safe distance from each other. Antiseptic solution and sanitisers should be provided and workers must wash their hands frequently. Taluk health officers are to visit the factories daily and ensure they are adhering to the guidelines.In Mandya alone, say labour officials, up to 30,000 people work in garment factories in closed, cramped conditions. Industry sources say “social distancing” is a tall order in such units and their continuance is a public health risk, considering the highly contagious nature of the coronavirus.Factory workers are livid with the state government’s decision. “Government offices and courts have been shut due to coronavirus. Even marriage functions and small gatherings are being discouraged. What then is the logic in forcing us to work in hordes in factories,” asked a worker from Gejjalagere near Maddur. “The government’s decision is cruel.”“Garment factory owners must have put pressure on the government or used other tactics. How can the state government ignore the plight of crores of garment workers and their families?” said Nagaraju, a factory worker.--",mysuru,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74743519,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-43307,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mysuru/mandya-dc-scraps-order-allows-garment-factories-to-operate/articleshow/74738270.cms

480,['21/03/2020'],Healthcare workers face crisis of protective gears,"NEW DELHI: Health care personnel in India face a dire situation in dealing with the Covid-19 pandemic with a shortage of quality personal protective equipment (PPE) looming as Indian manufacturers say they don’t know what to produce in the absence of health ministry specifications for them.

PPE manufacturers have been seeking specifications and testing protocols from the health ministry since mid-February, but the ministry is make public these specifications. Without quality specifications, it is anyone’s guess what kind of equipment is being procured.

Shortage of proper protection equipment has been one of the reasons for infections among health workers. Of 2,629 health workers infected in Italy, 13 have lost their lives. Of over 3,300 healthcare workers infected in China by early March, 22 died. There have been sporadic reports of doctors/nurses testing positive in India too, increasing the sense of insecurity among medical personnel, many of whom took to social media to talk about the shortage of protective gear.

On fixing specification, government sources said, “The textile ministry was to hold a meeting to modify the specifications to tailor them to what tests can be done in India. The baseline specifications are the same as for Ebola, but we do not have all the tests that need to be done for Ebola level equipment in India. The tests used to be done in the European Union, with certification by ISO.”

Minutes of a meeting held under the aegis of the textile ministry on March 18th, accessed by TOI, show how grim the situation is. The health ministry requires 7.25 lakh body overalls, 60 lakh N-95 masks and 1 crore 3-ply masks and orders for these have been placed. “However, there is a shortage of material and the rate of supply is not able to meet the rising demand,” the minutes noted. They added that with state governments also asking for protective textiles, the “demand is likely to further increase”. This is not even counting the number of such protective gear needed in the private sector.

“In an epidemic, health protection gear ought to be the responsibility of the health ministry. How can they shift blame to textile ministry?” asked Rajiv Nath of AiMed, an umbrella organization of Indian manufacturers of medical devices. AiMed had on Feb 8 urged the health ministry to start stocking up masks, protective gear, thermometers etc in view of shortages reported in other countries.

Preventive Wear Manufacturers Association of India (PWMAI) chairman Dr Sanjiiiv said that Indian companies were frustrated with the way they were being tossed from one bureaucrat to another with no decision being taken. “We have written several times to the health ministry from February 12 onwards and met many of them too. You can imagine their sense of urgency when they still haven’t managed to come out with specifications, over a month later. Without specifications, anyone can supply inferior stuff and that could endanger the lives of our health workers. Not putting specifications in the public domain also means that you can order protective gear from anyone whether they meet quality standards or not,” said Dr Sanjiiiv.

Health ministry claimed that the government had procured adequate amount of protective gear for its own facilities. When asked how the government had done procurement without setting standards, it was suggested to contact Dr T Rajasekhar of HLL. HLL Lifecare , a PSU, is the procurer of protective equipment for the government.

Dr Rajasekhar told TOI that HLL had internal partners from whom they procured and for more details about testing protocol suggested getting in touch with Dr P Raveendran director of Emergency Medical Relief and Dr Mandeep Bhandari , joint secretary in the health ministry. Ministry officials told TOI that standards for PPEs were already available and that they were revised recently. They claimed these have been shared with relevant stakeholders but not posted on the website because it was a technical document.

Surat: In a bid to prevent spread of cononavirus infection, Veer Narmad South Gujarat University (VNSGU) organized a medicine distribution on Friday where homeopathic medicine was distributed to over 1,200 people in just two hours. The free-of-cost medicine distribution was supported by C D Pachhigar College of Homeopathy (CDPCH) which is affiliated to VNSGU.

University registrar R D Patel had issued a circular in this regard on Thursday.

Staff members were encouraged to take advantage of event, the circular stated, further claiming that the medicine could give 'protection' against coronavirus. Men and women standing in long queues were seen outside the university health centre.

Those visiting the centre were given medicine in plastic pouch along with instructions to follow to prevent infection.

“We are giving the doze of homeopathic medicine which the person needs to take for three days, once a day. This can prevent coronavirus infection. It boosts overall immunity of a human being,” resident medical officer of CDPCH, Rajesh Pathak told TOI.

Not only in university, the medicine distribution will be held at 12 health centres of Surat Municipal Corporation (SMC) on Saturday. “We are distributing the medicine as per the Ministry of Ayush’s guidelines which states that few homeopath medicines can be used for prevention of infectious disease like Covid-19. There are no scientific findings about the effectiveness of the medicine in terms of infection of coronavirus but it helps improve overall immunity,” said Vipul Shashtri, principal of the CDPCH.

Despite several attempts VNSGU vice chancellor Shivendra Gupta was not available for comment.

SMC health officials claimed that they are not publicizing free distribution of the homeopathy medicine to avoid crowd. “We will ensure that people do not come to the health centres in large number and create crowd,” said A K Naik, deputy municipal commissioner (Health), SMC.

Gaikwad’s decision came after chief minister Uddhav Thackeray on Friday announced a complete lockdown in select big cities of the state.The education minister said, “Schools can declare results based on the comprehensive evaluation done throughout the year for Std I-VIII.”Though the state has the power anyway to announce such cancellations, provisions of Right To Education Act (RTE) gives it an added cover. Under the RTE, no child can be detained till Std VIII.Gaikwad said, “Till Std VIII, you don’t have the traditional exams. It’s more of an assessment of how much the child has comprehended.”When asked about board exams, Gaikwad said it will be held as per schedule. “There are two exams remaining for Saturday and Monday. It will proceed as planned,” said Gaikwad. For Std IX and XI exams, the minister said it will be held in April. “Around April 15 these exams may be held,” said the minister.The immediate question for CBSE schools was whether this applied to them as well. Though Gaikwad was speaking about state board schools, technically the same may apply to CBSE as well. Reason being CBSE’s control over a school starts from Std IX only. CBSE has always maintained that schools must follow every directive of the state they are based in.Many CBSE, ICSE etc schools in Maharashtra have already cancelled annual internal exams and considering the coronavirus scare, the education department is clearly looking the other way.An education official, who did not wish to be identified, said “The technicality of jurisdiction for a CBSE school can be debated, but the state will always have the final word. Laws and directives of the state are applicable to all. And even if CBSE schools are cancelling exams (till Std VIII) on their own, we all know it is a special situation and nobody wants to get involved in the technicality here.”With this decision, it seems schools are all set for an early vacation, but nobody wanted to officially say that. A school’s trustee said, “If exams are cancelled, why would parents now send children back to school? But it would be wrong for me to say so and declare a vacation without the government officially ending the academic session.”",nagpur,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74743383,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-216992,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/maha-schools-face-covid-19-test-no-exams-for-std-i-viii/articleshow/74738691.cms

CHANDIGARH: On March 6, 2018, a year after coming to power, Punjab CM Amarinder Singh had himself blown the lid off illegal mining , as he took photographs of illicit operations along the banks of the Satluj at Phillaur in Jalandhar and Rahon in Nawanshahr district, from his chopper, and then posted them online.Incensed by the lawlessness, Capt Amarinder had ordered the DGP to formulate a strategy in coordination with the mining department and district administrations to immediately stop illegal mining across the state. Two years after the CM’s reaction, the Congress’s MLAs are now claiming that illegal mining is rampant in the state.On the other hand, opposition outfits Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD), Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and Lok Insaaf Party (LIP) are accusing Congress ministers and MLAs of protecting people behind illegal mining. The Congress MLA from Urmar Tanda constituency in Hoshiarpur district, Sangat Singh Gilzian, was among those from the government who spoke against the illicit practice in the Punjab legislative assembly during recent budget session.SAD Dera Bassi MLA N K Sharma also said illegal miners were active behind the Chhatbir zoo near Zirakpur, SAS Nagar, along the Ghaggar banks. Capt Amarinder had, on March 3, announced in the assembly that a new mining policy would be introduced soon. In a meeting with DGP Dinkar Gupta on February 3, mining and geology minister Sukhbinder Singh Sarkaria said his department had received reports of illegal mining in some parts of the state.In October 2018, the cabinet approved an e-auction based Punjab State Sand and Gravel Policy and it was decided that the mining department would launch an online portal for sale of sand to all consumers. This, hoped the government, would help control sand prices. But the state government is yet to implement this.The Congress, in its manifesto for the 2017 assembly polls, had promised to end cartelisation and monopolisation over mining businesses. Though the state government approved the Punjab State Sand and Gravel Policy in October 2018, it was only between July and September 2019 that seven mining blocks or clusters were auctioned. These clusters have 196 identified mines with targeted excavation of 3.5 crore metric tonnes of sand and gravel. Under the new policy, contractors cannot sell sand over Rs 9 per cubic feet, which includes cost of loading.This implies that the cost of sand and gravel should not exceed Rs 3,600 per tractor-trolley. Because of the delay in environment clearances, the seven clusters could not start operations in time and illegal mining continued without any check on sand prices. So far, only five of the seven clusters have got environment clearance. The one in Mohali is expected to get clearance later this month, and the nod to Amritsar cluster is still in process. In all, 34 mines in the five clusters which have got clearance, have started functioning to extract one crore tonnes of mining minerals.The Punjab government has been able to collect Rs 75 crore in the first installment of the e-auctions so far. The revenue target from the e-auctions is Rs 306.69 crore. The state government had generated Rs 38 crore as revenue from mining activities in 2018-19.The number of FIRs registered for illegal mining across Punjab rose from 235 in 2018 to 252 in 2019. The mining department has one SP and two DSPs to check the practice even though the mining minister had demanded at least 30 cops from the DGP last year.",chandigarh,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74740543,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-185286,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/punjab-need-to-dig-deeper-to-streamline-mining/articleshow/74740535.cms
485,['21/03/2020'],Nagpur: Government tells teachers to work from home,"Representative image

NAGPUR: The state’s school education minister Varsha Gaikwad on Friday announced a work from home policy for teachers. The minister said the decision was made after representatives of these groups had petitioned the government for the same.

Earlier, the education department had allowed schools to rotate staff on a 50% capacity basis, which basically means staff working every alternate day.

Earlier in the day, chief minister Uddhav Thackeray had declared that staff levels in government offices will be reduced to 25%, from the earlier 50%. Fortunately for teachers, Gaikwad did one better. “We have implemented work from home for teachers,” said Gaikwad.

She clarified that this does not apply for anyone connected with the conduct of board exams. “SSC exams will be held as per the regular schedule,” said Gaikwad.

Principals in Nagpur are now awaiting for the order to come in writing so that they can implement it. “We know that the decision has been taken but till the same is received in writing from the education department we cannot go ahead with it,” said a principal.

The other demand which teachers had was that they should be allowed to do board evaluation work from home. Gaikwad said, “We had discussed this with the state board officials but they are not in favour of that. That’s because in the past some malpractices were noticed in such cases. Anyway, we have a shutdown for now and further decision will be taken after March 31.”

A teacher said earlier there was a lot of confusion over the reason as to why schools can’t be shut when students are not coming. “Kids are not coming and most of us are not connected with board exams. But we still have to report to do routine work because the school management probably prefers to have us around,” said the teacher.

Non-teaching staff at some schools continue to come daily and those working in CBSE institutes say they should also get the same benefit. “The problem with CBSE schools is that nobody takes responsibility when the situation is critical. CBSE says we are not involved till standard VIII and the state government says we are not affiliated to them. We are stuck in no-man’s-land,” said a clerical staff member.

CBSE is unlikely to issue any work from home circular for its teachers, unless it is directed to do so by the HRD ministry.

For the state, the circular related to Gaikwad’s statements is likely to be issued by Friday night.

NAGPUR: In wake of the Covid-19 outbreak affecting economic activities, business associations have sought relaxation in filing of tax returns, payment of statutory dues and loan instalments.

The Confederation of All India Traders (CAIT) has written to the Covid-19 task force formed by the government , demanding that payment of all statutory dues must be postponed till June 30. A similar relaxation has been sought for filing of GST returns and also deferment of 12 months in repayment of bank loans.

CAIT has demanded that RBI should issue an advisory to banks for providing interest free corona cash loans up to 50% of the businesses ’ existing limit in a hassle-free manner. This will help the traders meet their financial requirements. The cash bridge loan amount should be calculated on both fund and non-fund based limits, stated a CAIT press release.

CAIT has also suggested that a special drive should be launched for adoption of digital payments as currency is also a carrier of virus.

The Vidarbha Tax Payers Association (VTA) has suggested that the due date for filing income tax return should be extended from current last date of March 31. As many licences expired during financial year end, the government should allow the businesses to work on the existing licence till the situation improves, demanded CAIT.

AHMEDABAD/RAJKOT/VADODARA: The number of Covid-19 cases in Gujarat mounted to seven in just 12 hours ending Friday noon with five more testing positive, even as the four major cities were preparing for a virtual lock-down to curb the spread of the virus.

In Ahmedabad, two women and a man tested positive while in Vadodara, an NRI businessman and a 62-year-old woman were confirmed infected. All these persons had a recent foreign travel history from Spain, Finland, Sri Lanka and the US, said Jayanti Ravi , principal secretary, health and family welfare.

Even as reports of 34 people are awaited, 63 out of the 559 travellers who came to Gujarat on Thursday alone were put under quarantine whereas 492 were under home quarantine.

“Our priority is to ensure that the infection does not spread in community. So far, there are no cases of person-to-person contact and we are thus emphasizing on stringent quarantine of those who have come in contact with the persons,” Ravi said.

Civic authorities in the cities ordered shutting down of paan kiosks and doubled the fine for spitting on the roads to Rs 1,000.

On the lines of Maharashtra, Gujarat has also started hand-stamping on persons under quarantine from Thursday evening. “We had initially thought of wrist band, but we realized that it could be removed easily. We trust people, but we are getting instances daily of quarantine breach which is dangerous for public safety,” she added.

Meanwhile, the NRI, who has his business office and house in Spain, frequently travels between Vadodara and Spain. Before he was admitted in the isolation ward of SSG Hospital on March 17, he had travelled to Spain between February 27 and March 7 where his family resides. From Spain, the man had landed at Mumbai airport on March 8. After staying in Mumbai for two days, he had reached Vadodara on March 10. Officials said he had hired a taxi and travelled by road from Mumbai to reach Vadodara.

It was after six days stay in Vadodara’s Makarpura area that the NRI approached a private medical practitioner with complaint of fever. Later, he was referred at SSG Hospital

“All his travel history and contact listing has been done. His condition is stable and 10 individuals who came in his contact have been quarantined,” Vadodara collector Shalini Agrawal told reporters.

The 62-year-old, a resident of Tandalja area, had landed at Chennai airport from Sri Lanka and had reached Ahmedabad airport. She reached Vadodara by road from Ahmedabad. She was kept in isolation ward at SSG Hospital on March 18 after she had symptoms of Covid-19.

Rajkot health authorities heaved a sigh of relief as most relatives of the 32-year-old man infected with Covid-19 after returning from Mecca tested negative.

494,['21/03/2020'],Nagpur: Restoring pride of breast cancer survivors,"Representative image

NAGPUR: Over four decades ago, a teenager left the column about her preferred profession empty while filling her Std XII form as she was apprehensive about becoming a doctor one day. Her professor father prodded her to just write ‘Dr’ in the column and said it will happen. The girl went on to complete her MBBS and MD (Gynaceology) in the coming years.

That wasn’t the happy ending to her story. Professional challenges, personal problems and dilemmas hounded Dr Rohini Patil (57), who overcame them to not only set an example but also gift hope to terminally-ill patients and restore pride of breast cancer survivors.

In October last year, she organized Daan Utsav where around 100 knitters and crocheters joined her for a daylong ‘knit-e-thon’ and ‘croch-e-thon’. Dr Patil, with support from family members and a breast cancer survivor friend, made around 900 knitted knockers — handmade breast prothesis — and gifted them to survivors across India.

Her group, Knitted Knockers India, has rapidly gained popularity on social media, and volunteers from Nagpur, Pune Bengaluru , Delhi and even Dubai are soon going to be on-board. “After a broadcast on Women’s Day on Akashwani, we got calls from Sangli, Alibaug and several places from the state,” she said.

Dr Patil’s journey to creating awareness and finding an alternative for women who underwent mastectomy (removal of breast) dates back to 2002. One fine day that year, while she was playing with her 8-year-old son Aniket, she felt a hard nodule in her breast. “Even before seeing a surgeon, the diagnosis was clear in my mind,” she recalls. It was breast malignancy.

Dr Patil’s surgery was traumatic experience for Aniket. The infliction came at the time when she had started finding her feet once again after shifting with her one-half-year old son in the late 90s. “On the fourth day of my surgery, I did a C-section on a patient at the same hospital,” she said, adding that Aniket’s smile helped her come out of those difficult times.

She was a changed person. “I learnt how people around loved me and how kids are a source of strength. It took away negative impact of cancer diagnosis and treatment,” she said.

A year later, she set up a nursing home, catering to the poor, and in the next seven years dedicated herself to working for terminally-ill patients and creating breast cancer awareness.

She got a hand-held screening device and mammography mobile unit from JNMC Swangi Meghe and reached up to Darekasa in Gondia’s Naxal belt.

During one such camp, she met tribal patients who developed negative body image, were depressed and secluded themselves after mastectomy.

“A survivor in the tribal area kept a bamboo basket to create a mount of the breast. This woman got her post surgery delicate area injured because of the rough edges of the basket. I did the dressing and healed the wound but the emotional trauma was difficult to address,” she said.

She met another survivor who came out of house 10 months post mastectomy because she was apprehensive in going out as her clothes were not fitting.

“The traditional silicone breast prosthesis are expensive. I was not able to sponsor them,” she said.

Meanwhile, Dr Patil visited the United States , where Aniket had shifted for his MS in Mechanical Engineering and subsequent job.

“I would visit camps and interact with breast cancer survivors. Majority of them were not using the silicone prosthesis. They were using hand-knit knockers which had crafted breast prosthesis. I sought help of Knitted Knockers founder in the US for training,” she said.

Dr Patil learnt the craft in two weeks at Tucson in Arizona. Since her return she has distributed the prosthetic free of cost to 1,000 survivors.
