0,['11/03/2020'],Say hello to Bengaluru’s furry campus celebrities,"They may not have been officially adopted by the college administration, but many stray dogs and cats have found their way into city campuses by making friends with and winning the hearts of either students or teachers. They are fondly looked after by their new buddies, who get them food as well as take them for all the necessary vaccinations. And there’s more! These pets are quite the stars on social media too, with some of them even having their Instagram pages. Let’s trace their paw prints on city campuses and hear what they have to say about themselves…National Law School of India UniversityI am one of the coolest pets on campus. I am moody, but will allow my friends to pat me. I do not like strangers near me, and will scare them off if I have to. Sometimes, I love to walk into the classroom during lectures and disturb the professors. I think the students like it too. I enjoy the food that students and faculty members give me. I am not much of a people’s person, but I have a close circle of friends and I am fond of them all.Symbiosis Institute of Business ManagementOften spotted near the garden and the basement, we love belly rubs and cuddles. We usually don’t like the sun, but then there are days when you will find us lazing around on a bright and sunny day. We love the attention we receive from the students and the staff here, who always feed us biscuits. We are mostly active in the afternoons, as we are surrounded by our fans. Since these students are always running around or busy studying, we help them relax and cheer them up.RV College of EngineeringI am one of the most active guys on campus. Even though, I have siblings and many four-legged friends here, I am one of the quickest pets you’ll find around. Since I am tiny, students often carry me on their lap, which I do not mind at all. I am a no-fuss guy, as I will eat whatever the students offer me. But my favourite food is chicken. I am so popular that my friends on campus even made an Instagram page for me. I love when students play music for me.Mount Carmel CollegeAlthough I don’t have an official name, I consider myself the ‘Queen of Mount Carmel College’. You will see me wandering around the corridors, and occasionally relaxing in a student’s arms. I am told that I have a lot of attitude. Well, someone here has to, right? And yes, I am an attention seeker. You will mostly find me near the Purple Canteen on campus, where I am fed to my heart’s delight. I do not enjoy vegetables much, but show me some non-vegetarian food, and I’ll be the nicest cat you would have ever met. My favourite pastime is purring at students and stalking them in the hallway.RV College of EngineeringMy claim to fame is that I have been a huge hit at the Acting Society on campus, where I had once played dead during the rehearsals with the students. I’m a picture of grace and I’ve been told that I am one of the most beautiful pets on campus. When I see my friends, I run to them and shower them with my sloppy kisses.Jain (Deemed-to-be) UniversityI am the college’s unofficial watchdog. My daily routine involves keeping a watchful eye at the gate and keeping a check on who enters the campus. The moment I see my friends approach the gate, I welcome them in my special way. I am not a big fan of the sun, so you will usually find me sitting cosily in one of the corners. I enjoy being petted and my fan club boasts many female followers. I love munching on biscuits.National Law School of India UniversityI am the star attraction at National Law School of India University, as I am one of the oldest pets on campus. I have two sons, Pushkin and Dan, whom I love a lot. You will always find me around the little stall on campus, goring on delicious bun maskas. I am either sleeping or getting belly rubs most of the time. My other furry friends from the animal kingdom are looked after by the members of the Society for Non-Human Persons, who get us vaccinated and feed us delicious food.",life-style,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74563151,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-187891/74563151.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//life-style/spotlight/say-hello-to-bengalurus-furry-campus-celebrities/articleshow/74563151.cms

The latest, we hear, is the possibility of a Kannada film based on the Coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak. Kannada filmmaker Umesh Banakar has registered an all-India title Deadly Corona , with the Kannada version to be called Corona. “The world is worried about this pandemic. It is a topic that has got everyone, across countries, irrespective of where they come from, worrying about people’s health collectively. We have registered the title Deadly Corona for an all-India copyright, while we are awaiting for the approval of Corona from the Karnataka film chamber. Since ‘deadly’ has been associated with Ravi Srivatsa’s films, we decided to go with just Corona for the Kannada title,” he says. The cast and crew will be revealed shortly. “The film will touch upon the gravity of the issue and the impact it has had across the world,” Umesh says about the movie.",entertainment,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74563563,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-130053/74563563.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/kannada/movies/news/sandalwood-set-to-get-a-film-based-on-the-coronavirus-now/articleshow/74563563.cms

3,['11/03/2020'],seethayana: Shashi Kumar's son Akshith is ready for his debut,"His father, Shashi Kumar , was the poster boy of Kannada cinema in the 90s. “But when I told my parents that I, too would like to become an actor, my mother responded with an outright ‘No’, and my father was taken aback. It was probably because they have still not come to terms with the horrific accident that my father met with at the peak of his career. It’s taken them time to accept my choice, but I’m glad it all worked out in the end. Now they’re looking forward to seeing me on the big screen,” says Akshith Shashi Kumar. Sharing the first look of his debut Seethayana with us, Akshith tells us how excited he was to go on the set of his film. “It may seem strange, yet in all these years, I have never before been on a film set. My mother was extremely protective of me and I understand why she did that. It was only during the shoot of Munirathna Kurukshetra that I finally got to go on a set and see my father in action. That’s the day I decided I wanted to pursue acting, too,” Akshith tells us. Seethayana is the result of his big dream and taking acting lessons alongside doing engineering, so he couldn’t be more thrilled. “The film didn’t come to me because I’m a star kid. The days of nepotism are long gone. I went through an audition for this film and I got the role because of my capability. It’s the audience who will decide what my journey in the industry will be like,” says the debutant. The movie, a romantic thriller, is directed by debutant Prabhakar Aaripaka and stars Anahitha Bhooshan as the leading lady.",entertainment,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74563269,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-229835/74563269.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/kannada/movies/news/shashi-kumars-son-akshith-is-ready-for-his-debut/articleshow/74563269.cms
4,['11/03/2020'],Siddhant Karnick: Megha Gupta and I realised that we were more at peace when we were not together,"In April last year, we had reported about trouble in actor couple Megha Gupta and Siddhant Karnick ’s marriage. They had started living separately at that time. The two eventually filed for a divorce, which came through a few days ago.While Megha remained unavailable for comment, Siddhant spoke to us about what went wrong in their marriage. He said, “No marriage is easy. In our case, I would say that we ran out of patience. In any relationship, peace of mind is of paramount importance. It’s like you pinch yourself on your arm and keep that pressed… after some time, you get used to it and live with it. Then suddenly, when you separate and that pinch goes away, you feel, ‘Oh, my God! I was missing this peace of mind’. That’s the best way I can summarise my marriage. Megha and I went for therapy and tried to do everything we could to make it work, but in vain. We even started living separately in March last year. We felt that it would be better if we lived apart for some time and see if distance made the heart grow fonder. However, we realised that we had more peace of mind when we were not together. Having said that, it’s not that we weren’t good together. In fact, we were great together. She is a great travel partner and I have some of the best travel memories with her. But I guess, there was so much more that we were both looking for. That’s when we decided to go our separate ways. I have realised that two good people might not make for a great marriage.”About their divorce, the ' Ek Tha Raja Ek Thi Rani ' actor said, “Divorces can get ugly, but fortunately, it didn’t turn ugly for us. That’s because Megha and I decided to leave when there was still a little love left between us, which helped us sail through.”Their families were supportive and that made the divorce easier. Siddhant said, “Marriage is not just between two individuals, but two families. Fortunately, our families realised that life is more than just marriage.” The failed marriage has resulted in a lot of introspection. He said, “I am in a relationship with myself now and I am having a good time. I have realised what a great guy I am. It’s important to know yourself and get back in a relationship with yourself first. When you are married, you start thinking for the two of you and ignore yourself most of the time, which is not healthy for a marriage. You should always have your own space and identity, which I guess I had lost somewhere. Right now, I am being on my own and being in a relationship isn’t a priority.”Megha and Siddhant met at a common friend’s party in 2015 and hit it off instantly. She was earlier married to Aditya Shroff, but the two parted ways in 2014, ending their marriage of four years.",tv,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74563081,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-57084/74563081.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//tv/news/hindi/siddhant-karnick-megha-gupta-and-i-realised-that-we-were-more-at-peace-when-we-were-not-together/articleshow/74563098.cms

One actor , who had been elusive on that list so far, was Real Star Upendra, with whom she only got to do a commercial some time ago. That is set to change now, as Hariprriya will pair with Upendra in director K Madesh ’s upcoming untitled film . “I am very excited to finally be in a film with Uppi sir. But that apart, the script, my role in it and the whole team piqued my interest. The film is likely to go on floors by May or June, as everyone involved with it is tied up with other commitments,” says the actress, adding that Madesh has instructed everyone not to divulge anything about the film just yet. What she does say, though, is that the script fits in perfectly with her idea of doing a variety of meaty characters. “Earlier, I always took up projects when the narration excited me. But over time, I realised that some of them change between narration and execution, so now, when I meet potential collaborators, I also measure the capabilities of everyone involved with it before signing up.

10,['11/03/2020'],Hand sanitisers out of stock? Kolkatans get creative with homemade alternatives,"The highly infectious novel coronavirus is showing no signs of slowing down in India. With the number of cases soaring over 50, manufacturers are facing a huge number of new orders for hand sanitisers. The result? Store shelves are empty as supplies dwindle. To add to the woes, pharmacies have little estimate of when sanitisers might become available.

Ragini Agarwal, who owns a natural bath and body products range, says, “With the coronavirus scare reaching its peak, the situation is really worrisome. So, I decided to make natural sanitiser at home with ingredients like aloe vera gel, vitamin E oil and lemon extracts. People have used the product and given positive feedback. It is safe to use on babies as well — I am cleansing my toddler's hands with it.”

While sanitisers are handy and can be used on the go if you don’t have access to running water, many feel that soap poses as a better defense against germs than a natural sanitiser. Kolkatans are certain that at some point they may have no choice. Sneha Das, a resident of Dhakuria, is making alcohol-based sanitisers at home. “I am making them at home since no pharmaceutical shops near my residence have them in stock. While the ingredients are a few, it is important to keep safety in mind while making them at home. Gloves are a must,” she says.

Aishwarya Biswas, who also makes natural handmade soaps, face washes and creams, says, “Though hand sanitisers are convenient, anti-bacterial soaps are much more effective in getting rid of germs. Not only do they kill the germs, but the water also washes away into the sewage. People have become very conscious in the wake of the epidemic. They are avoiding alcohol-based beauty products and opting for plant-based ones.”

Five easily available ingredients for hand sanitisers

1. Aloe vera extract

2. Vitamin E essential oil

3. Tea tree

essential oil

4. Cinnamon or clove essential oil

5. Distilled water

‘Around 50 to 60 people are asking for hand sanitisers daily’

Most of the medicine shops are out of stock on hand sanitisers. We are not getting supplies from the manufacturing companies. The demand has spiked exponentially and the price-gouging on e-commerce sites has also contributed to more people thronging pharmacies. Every day, around 50 to 60 people are asking for hand sanitisers. At this point, there’s little clarity as to when we will be able to restock on supplies. We are planning to put up a signboard that reads ‘hand sanitisers out of stock’.

DIY natural hand sanitiser with alcohol

l 2/3 cup of 99% rubbing alcohol

( isopropyl alcohol ) or ethanol

l 1/3 cup of aloe vera gel

l 8 to 10 drops of essential oil

Do not rely on homemade therapies, say doctors

Any soap or alcohol-based hand sanitiser is good but one should not blindly rely on homemade therapies or naturopathy at this hour of crisis, say doctors. “Soaps, be it solid or liquid, are more effective than homemade hand sanitiser,” says Dr Pinaki Chakraborty, a general physician.

Dermatologists are of the opinion that homemade hand sanitisers are neither too skin-friendly nor too effective. “They can burn the epidermis, cause

rashes, irritation or excessive dryness. In the US, people make hand sanitisers at home using vodka. Those are not useful since vodka has only 42% of alcohol content, whereas a hand sanitiser must have a mininum alcohol content of 90% to kill germs,” says Dr Basab Sahana , a consultant dermatologist.

MNC Offices amp up safety measures

A sanitiser dispenser has been installed at the entry point of our office in Alipore. It's mandatory for everyone to disinfect their hands. Biometric entry devices have also been discontinued temporarily to contain the spread of the virus.

— Satadru Sen, an officer-goer at Alipore

Making your own alcohol-based sanitiser may be risky

Making your own alcohol-based hand sanitiser at home can be a dangerous idea since it’s important to get the concentrations of the mixture correct. Isopropyl alcohol, which is a common alcohol used in hand sanitisers, can cause skin complications. It can excessively dry the skin or cause superficial burns. It's also flammable, so one must not mix the ingredients near an open flame or heat source.

BHOPAL: Jyotiraditya Scindia made it an unhappy Holi for Congress, quitting the party early Tuesday, which triggered 22 MLA resignations and pushed the Kamal Nath government to the brink.Seventeen of the MLAs who have resigned are from the Scindia faction, and two were already incommunicado. Three others joined them, including one brought back from Bengaluru. BJP promptly took the resignations to Speaker NP Prajapati, who said he would take a decision only after legal opinion.If the resignations are accepted, it'll reduce Congress's strength in the 230-member Assembly to 92, and BJP, with 107 MLAs, could stake claim to form the government. There were reports of an SP and a BSP MLA - who have so far supported the Congress government - meeting Shivraj Singh Chouhan, the three-time BJP CM.The crisis hit the Kamal Nath government on the 75th birth anniversary of Congress stalwart Madhavrao Scindia, Jyotiraditya's father.

BHOPAL: Jyotiraditya Scindia made it an unhappy Holi for Congress, quitting the party early Tuesday, which triggered 22 MLA resignations and pushed the Kamal Nath government to the brink.Seventeen of the MLAs who have resigned are from the Scindia faction, and two were already incommunicado. Three others joined them, including one brought back from Bengaluru. BJP promptly took the resignations to Speaker NP Prajapati, who said he would take a decision only after legal opinion.If the resignations are accepted, it'll reduce Congress's strength in the 230-member Assembly to 92, and BJP, with 107 MLAs, could stake claim to form the government. There were reports of an SP and a BSP MLA - who have so far supported the Congress government - meeting Shivraj Singh Chouhan, the three-time BJP CM.The crisis hit the Kamal Nath government on the 75th birth anniversary of Congress stalwart Madhavrao Scindia, Jyotiraditya's father. In the morning, Scindia drove himself to PM Narendra Modi's residence, where home minister Amit Shah was already present. After that, Scindia went to Shah's residence and around 1pm, tweeted his resignation letter addressed to AICC chief Sonia Gandhi.Dated March 9, it says: ""As you well know, this is a path that has been drawing itself out over the last year,"" and goes on to add that he was ""unable to work in the party anymore"".Scindia's resignation left Congress in shock, but state party leaders rallied behind CM Nath and vowed to battle it out.

14,['11/03/2020'],City kickstarts day with fresh and affordable health drinks,"They say, all’s well that ends well. But early morning fitness enthusiasts of Kolkata swear by the mantra ‘all’s well that begins well’. Even before the whole debate around the best pre- and post-workout food started in the last few years, morning walkers and joggers had found the perfect way to kickstart their day on a healthy note with the help of a host of morning boosters that are available at popular spots soon after the crack of dawn for almost two decades now. Places frequented by morning walkers — including Rabindra Sarobar Central Park and Victoria Memorial area — have stalls selling everything from fresh amla and neem juices, beler pana , to the more filling sprouts salad that not only take care of one’s daily requirement of micronutrients but also prevent people from binge-eating after sweating it out.For actor Shaheb Bhattacherjee , who is a regular morning walker, having a health drink after his workout is a must. “After my run, I have a glass of either fresh amla or neem juice. Both help purify the blood. At times, I also go for beler pana. Apart from the drinks, sometimes I also have a moong-chana salad with fresh lime and cucumber. It’s highly nutritious as well as tasty,” he said.Hare Krishna Das, who has been selling health drinks in front of Rabindra Sarobar since 2001, gets his first client as early as 5 am. “I’ve over 200 customers who start flocking to my stall early morning to choose from the nine types of juices I prepare fresh everyday. From blood pressure, sugar, acidity to constipation and weight issues, each of these drinks has unique health benefits,” says Hare Krishna, who wakes up at 3 am to prepare the juices from fresh raw ingredients like amla, neem, tulsi, turmeric and more. “Some prefer having methi and honey in warm water before their walk or run and after coming back, they choose their drink based on their requirement. Women are more into aloe vera and bottle gourd juice that are good for skin and hair as well as to keep weight in check,” he says. In case of any leftover, Hare Krishna makes sure to dispose them of. “I don’t add anything other than water in my juices — they are all pure and fresh. However, some ask for lime water or a bit of honey in their drink when it’s too bitter for their taste. For cold, I recommend tulsi and ginger juice mixed with honey. Chirotar jol (soaked bitter stick water) is another popular item here. It feels really nice when people come up and tell me my juices are helping them in their fitness journey,” he signs off.Stationed in front of Central Park since 1997, for Sambhu Bishal’s customers, the health drinks sold by him are like medicine. “I can’t even take a day off as I’ve become a part of the morning adda. A group of elderly would sit in front of my shop after their morning walk and discuss various issues over my drinks,” says Shambhu, who insists his customers have a slice of cucumber on empty stomach as that improves digestion. “Every juice is made using fresh ingredients. Neem, amla, tulsi, pudina are all-time favourites,” he says. A glass of juice that used to cost `3 when he initially set up this stall is now sold for `20. “At times customers want a mix of two-three juices and that costs `30, he adds.Arnab Ghosh, a student who goes to Salt Lake every morning to practice football, says, “My mother makes sure I have neem juice outside Central Park after practice everyday. She says it will purify my blood. After that, I have the moong-chana salad as that’s tasty and so nutritious.”Sandeep Bagrecha, a businessman who regularly walks at Rabindra Sarobar, said, “For the past three to four years, I’mhaving a glass of neem and haldi juice regularly after my walk to boost my immunity.”Ginger juice: Improves digestion; controls acidity; removes bad breath; relieves cold and congestionTulsi juice :Regulates blood sugar; reduces stress; helps treat respiratory ailments like chronic bronchitis, asthma etcAmla juice: Rich in nutrients, it boosts immunity, metabolism and prevents viral and bacterialailments, including cold and cough; aids in digestion; helps in maintaining clear skin, healthy hair and good eyesight.Neem juice: Aids in the breakdown of body fat, which keeps weight in check; improves metabolism; has anti-ageing propertiesAlo vera juice : Helps get rid of constipation; rich source of Vitamin C; controls blood sugar level",entertainment,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74563715,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-30136/74563715.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/bengali/movies/news/city-kickstarts-day-with-fresh-and-affordable-health-drinks/articleshow/74563715.cms

NEW DELHI: Jyotiraditya Scindia 's rebellion set off rumblings in Congress about many ticking bombs within, as much a result of the leadership vacuum at the top as of a 'generational clash' that has wrecked the party over the last year.

The loss of an important leader and a state government in the middle of an intense debate on CAA-NRC and a Parliament session can be demoralising for the opposition party. Though Jyotiraditya Scindia has been gradually drifting away from Congress, he has been seen as close to Rahul Gandhi, usually sitting next to him in the previous Lok Sabha. The failure to accommodate his ambition and, in fact, cut him out of the power equation in MP has cost Congress dearly.

Murmurs were rife in Congress over many other young leaders brimming with aspiration but being set back by elders in their states. Scindia's resignation letter where he told Sonia Gandhi that ""this path has been drawing itself out over last year"" made evident that his gripe was against CM Kamal Nath and Digvijaya Singh, who had joined hands to stall him.

Though unstated, the buzz that no young leader would get his due given Rahul Gandhi's pre-eminence in the scheme of things, has only grown louder.

Kuldeep Bishnoi, Haryana MLA, tweeted that Scindia's exit was a big loss and many other capable leaders were feeling alienated. It triggered alarm about upcoming Rajya Sabha elections in Haryana. While Congress can win a seat in the state, it has a buffer of just one MLA with one member appearing unable to vote because of health concerns, and the situation is likely to embolden the ruling BJP to make a bid for the second berth. A senior leader said the party would have to be careful about the choice of candidate as well as management of votes in Haryana.

But apart from immediate issues, the longer term problems, masked somewhat by BJP losing out in Maharashtra, post-poll, and failing to retain Jharkhand and falling short in Delhi, have been brought to the fore by Scindia's successful revolt.

Rajasthan Congress chief and deputy chief minister Sachin Pilot has warned the leadership that nomination of a money bag to the Upper House, as is being speculated, will send a negative signal to the electorate as well as the party cadre. Pilot is currently well-ensconced in Congress, where he has a stake, but leaders like him may well expect their voices to be heard more respectfully.

Scindia's exit, according to a party member, reflects that Rahul has given up or is indifferent to extreme steps by his colleagues that can seriously set back the party. The social media was rife with claims that the Congress chief refused an appointment to Scindia last week.

The drift at the top is best reflected by the failure of the party to select new leaders for state units. DK Shivakumar's name was apparently finalised for Karnataka PCC, but has been in a limbo for over two months, in view of objections of senior leaders. The leadership of Maharashtra and Mumbai units too is up for grabs while the Punjab unit is beset with serious dissidence.

As reported by TOI, a group of young leaders have been discussing among themselves about the threat that continuing vacuum at the top poses to state units, and are planning to speak out sometime in future.

18,['11/03/2020'],Shivraj Singh Chouhan may take over as MP CM for fourth term,"NEW DELHI: If everything goes according to BJP's plan, three-time Madhya Pradesh CM Shivraj Singh Chouhan may take over for a fourth term, after being out of power for 15 months, somewhat settling scores for BJP's ouster in Maharashtra, where its rivals teamed up with Shiv Sena.

A few days ago, the Leader of Opposition in Gujarat assembly Paresh Dhanani had teased BJP benches by telling deputy CM Nitin Patel that Congress would ""make him the deputy CM if he walked out of BJP with 15-20 MLAs"". The jibe may have discomfited Patel, but the brewing storm in Madhya Pradesh was just beyond the horizon.

The Madhya Pradesh shocker came even as Congress leaders felt they had a handle on BJP by challenging it on issues like the economy and anti-CAA unrest. Jyotiraditya Scindia and BJP were scripting a regime-change story.

Scindia's joining will be a big boost to the saffron party, which lost the assembly polls in 2018 because of poor performance in Gwalior-Chambal region, the stronghold of the Scindia clan. Besides, his induction will help focus attention on Congress's growing vulnerability at a time when the Modi government is battling resistance to CAA, with the Delhi result seen as a win for its opponents.

It also scotches rumours of whatever reservations Modi-Shah may have had about Shivraj Singh Chouhan. There was speculation that BJP is unwilling to bring down the Nath government due to a ""trust deficit"". BJP sources maintained that they were clear about not acting in a hurry and waiting for the contradictions to ripen. There were initial apprehensions about complications for leadership's equations with rival branch of Scindia clan. Jyotiraditya's equations with his aunt Vasundhara Raje, former Rajasthan CM, were said to be not even.

The rivalry was at least partly a fallout of the political schism in the family, which started when Vijaya Raje Scindia paid a price for opposing Emergency and staying with Bhartiya Jan Sangh.

If sources are to be believed, the Scindia family is united now and the recent picture of Vasundhara Raje hugging her nephew was an indication that the entire family is together. There are other likely claimants to the CM post but Chouhan's claim is clearly well recognised. BJP has moved with caution. Before the rebel Congress MLAs were flown to a 'safe-house' in Bengaluru on Monday, a BJP leader, who was coordinating with them, asked them at least twice as if they are ""completely ready"" to quit the party in support of Scindia, who had made up his mind to join BJP as he was upset with the Congress leadership for neither considering him as PCC chief nor nominating him to Rajya Sabha.

As the MLAs assured to stay firm, BJP leaders swung into action. Chouhan and Union minister Narendra Singh Tomar, who were assigned to keep a watch on developments in the state, held meetings with the party high command, including home minister Amit Shah and J P Nadda to finalise the plan to topple the Nath government and have Scindia join the party.

Scindia's aunt and BJP MLA Yashodhara Raje played a crucial role as she termed her nephew's imminent joining BJP as ""ghar-wapasi"" since his father Madhavrao Scindia had quit Jan Sangh and joined Congress after differences with his mother, the late Rajmata Vijaya Raje Scindia, one of the founder members of BJP.

The BJP central election committee met on Tuesday to finalise Rajya Sabha candidates and review MP developments. After the CEC meeting, Modi, Shah and Nadda sat separately to ensure precise execution of the plan. Even the Congress rebel MLAs' resignation being sent to Governor Lalji Tandon was part of the strategy to ensure that Speaker doesn't make any confusions about receiving the letter.

At Tuesday's meeting, sources said, there was no discussion about the three RS candidates from Madhya Pradesh, possibly because Scindia is still not a BJP member. He is likely to join in a couple of days, after which his candidature is likely to be announced.

It was learnt that there was no discussion about Chouhan's taking over as CM, as it will be formally discussed only after more clarity emerges in the state over status of resignation of the Congress MLAs.

BHOPAL: Holi badhais came with added zing - and firecrackers - at the state BJP HQ in Bhopal on Tuesday. Jyotiraditya Scindia had walked out of Congress with his team, and the door was open for BJP to return to office.

Scindia was welcome in the saffron camp and party workers cheered but top leaders, however, stuck to the official line that it was ""Congress's internal matter"". Only BJP chief whip in assembly, Narottam Mishra - accused by Congress of trying to poach ruling alliance MLAs last week - said Scindia would be greeted warmly by BJP.

""There must have been some compulsions that led him (Scindia) to take this decision. Everyone is heartily welcome in BJP. Scindia ji is definitely welcome,"" said Mishra. There was euphoria at the party HQ, when the party's state in-charge, Vinay Sahasrabuddhe, former CM Shivraj Singh Chouhan, state party chief V D Sharma and leader of opposition Gopal Bhargava arrived.

There were smiles all around, but the top leadership was careful with its words. ""We are here to discuss Rajya Sabha polls. The Congress infighting has been exposed and now it's up to the party to take decisions... We are nowhere involved in this,"" said Sahasrabuddhe.

29,['11/03/2020'],Small lenders that cleared cheques via Yes Bank stuck,"Mayur Shetty | TNN

Mumbai: Yes Bank ’s disconnect from various payments and fund transfer networks is affecting over 50 small banks, including cooperative, foreign and regional rural banks.

With the moratorium shutting Yes Bank from the cheque clearing and real time gross settlement ( RTGS ) systems, several other banks that depend on the troubled private lender are also shut out.

Yes Bank provides sub-member bank services to cooperative, private and foreign banks whose operations are too small to invest in a direct membership. The services include facilities such as RBI clearing house, RTGS, national electronic funds transfer ( NEFT ), the national financial switch (for ATMs ).

Among the foreign banks that the troubled Yes Bank was servicing is Doha Bank . Several district central cooperative banks are also customers of Yes Bank.

The affected banks include 13 cooperative banks and regional rural banks in the northeast where banking penetration is relatively lower. Cheques of these banks cannot be presented for clearing as lenders have issued instructions that those that are sub-members of the clearing system through Yes Bank’s membership will not be able to get their cheques to clear.

“Yes Bank is unlike the small cooperative banks that have been regulatory placed under moratorium by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). Besides being a large bank, it is also a financial services infrastructure provider for other banks,” said a banker.

Earlier this week, the fintech world was thrown into a disarray as many startups were blocked form UPI payments as they were using application programming interfaces (APIs) provided by Yes Bank.

When the RBI placed Yes Bank under moratorium last week, fintechs providing third-party UPI services like PhonePe were hit. Yes Bank was the sole partner to 20 third-party players providing UPI services. It also provided API banking services to enable straight-through processing of transactions for businesses.Also, Yes Bank has 92,065 point of sale (PoS) terminals (card swipe machines), which cannot be used due to the moratorium. Thus, merchants that have only Yes Bank PoS machines have not been able to accept card payments.

30,['11/03/2020'],Scrapping of AT1 bonds to hit MFs,"MUMBAI: The Reserve Bank of India’s (RBI’s) decision to extinguish additional tier-1 (AT1) bonds of Yes Bank will hurt a large number of retail and other investors (through write-offs in mutual funds and insurance funds), bank treasuries and high net worth individuals (HNIs).In addition, RBI’s decision has also increased uncertainty about these bonds, which are leading to a drop in the prices of bonds issued by other banks, analysts said. As prices of these bonds drop, most will see the value of their investments go down.According to Suman Chowdhury, president (ratings) at Acuite Ratings & Research, the RBI decision on Yes Bank’s AT1 bonds strongly validates the inherent risk in these bonds, or Innovative Perpetual Debt Instruments (IPDI), which form part of the tier-1 capital of a bank.“This is for the first time in the history of the Indian banking sector that a bank’s T1 bonds are being written down at the ‘point of non-viability’ (PONV), that is the investors have to take a hit on both principal and the balance interest payments,” he said in a note.Clearly, investors in such bonds, mainly the MFs and banks’ treasuries, will need to take a significant hit due to this development. “Acuite also believes that this will limit the market for AT1 bonds in India only to issuances by a few large public sector banks and, further, the pricing will see increased differential with that of tier-2 bonds to reflect the differential risk,” Chowdhury said.All the mutual funds like Nippon India MF , Franklin Templeton MF , UTI MF , Kotak MF and some others, which were holding these bonds by Yes Bank, have already written off their investments.According to a report by domestic brokerage Batlivala & Karani Securities, of about Rs 94,000 crore AT1 bonds currently being held by various institutions, which have been issued by various PSU and private banks, nearly 42% or about Rs 38,000 crore is with several mutual funds. The rest are with insurance companies, HUFs, trusts and others.“As market’s trust on AT1 bonds is sure to wane after the RBI decision to extinguish Yes Bank’s AT1 bonds, the prices of these bonds will fall (and yields will rise), the NAVs of funds will take a hit. Also, going forward “market will differentiate between good and bad credit, and accordingly we will see yield spreads widening across names but clearly differentiating between strong and weaker names,” the report by B&K Securities noted.“From MF perspective, after 100% mark down of Yes Bank bonds, we believe IndusInd Bank’s AT1 bonds are likely to face the major brunt (due to spread widening),” B&K Securities noted. Soon after the RBI decision on Thursday evening, IndusInd Bank had postponed a scheduled board meeting that was to deliberate issuance of AT1 bonds, among other agendas, by the lender.",business,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74573868,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-720945,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/scrapping-of-at1-bonds-to-hit-mfs/articleshow/74567676.cms
31,['11/03/2020'],RBI regulates AT1 bonds,"What are AT1 bonds ?

Additional tier-1 bonds, also called AT1 in market parlance, are a kind of perpetual bonds without any expiry date that banks are allowed to issue to meet their long-term capital requirement. That’s why these bonds are treated as quasi-equity instruments under the law. The RBI is the regulator for these bonds.

Do these bonds pay interest?

Yes. AT1 bonds are like any other bonds issued by banks and companies, which pay a fixed rate of interest at regular intervals. Usually, these bonds pay a slightly higher rate of interest compared to similar, non-perpetual bonds. However, the issuing bank has no obligation to pay back the principal to investors.

Are these bonds traded in the market?

Yes. These bonds are listed and traded on the exchanges. So, if an AT1 bondholder needs money, he can sell it in the market.

How are AT1 bonds redeemed?

Investors cannot return these bonds to the issuing bank and get the money. This means there is no put option available to its holders. However, the issuing banks have the option to recall AT1 bonds issued by them (termed call option). They can go for a call option five years after these are issued and then every year at a pre-announced period. This way, the issuing banks can give an exit option to AT1 bondholders.

At present, what’s the total value of AT1 bonds in the market?

According to a report by rating agency Icra, nearly Rs 94,000 crore worth of AT1 bonds are currently issued by various banks. Of this, Rs 55,000 crore is from PSU banks , while the balance Rs 39,000 crore is from private lenders.

32,['11/03/2020'],Axis Trustees files petition against RBI’s resolution plan,"Swati Deshpande & Mayur Shetty | TNN

Mumbai: In a swift move, Axis Trustees , the debenture trustees for Yes Bank , rushed to Bombay high court on Monday and filed a petition to raise concerns over a draft scheme proposed to be framed by the Reserve Bank of India ( RBI ), particularly the “unreasonable” write-down clause that deals with additional tier-1 (AT1) capital bonds.

The central bank’s draft reconstruction plan suggests a permanent write-down of these AT1 bonds, which are outstanding as on March 5. The petition filed through law firm Manilal Kher Ambalal was mentioned by its counsel Janak Dwarkadas for an urgent hearing before a bench of Justice K K Tated and Sarang Kotwal. Dwarkadas said by the proposed scheme, the RBI wants to write down the entirety of approximately Rs 8,400 crore of bonds, thereby the liability of the bank would stand reduced by that amount.

The RBI had called for objections and suggestions to be submitted by March 9. Axis Trustees has submitted its objections and suggestions on behalf of bondholders but the apprehension is that the scheme may be notified without hearing them out, in which case the petition would become infructuous and the implication would be irreversible.

The bench asked Axis Trustees to give notice to the RBI. Vikram Trivedi , managing partner of the law firm representing Axis, said it would mention the matter again on Wednesday before the bench. Under international best practices, these tier 1 bonds are rated higher than equity but do not have a priority like secured creditors. The Axis Trustees’ petition, as its short point, says that since 51% of the equity capital, which includes 8% of promoters stake is not being disturbed, the tier 1 bonds ought not to be written off at this stage. The plea made by the Trustees is that it be allowed to make a “separate, purposeful and comprehensive representation in writing setting forth all its reservations, objections and suggestions to the draft scheme, 2020, to be framed by the RBI under the Banking Regulation Act, and also an opportunity to be heard on the representation”. As an interim relief, the Trustees want the scheme to not be implemented without such hearing. The petition said that the RBI “to the surprise of all relevant stakeholders, late in the evening on March 6 made the draft scheme available for the first time”. The objection is to the sixth paragraph of the draft scheme.

Another lender, like Axis, had also planned to approach the HC on Monday but has chosen to wait and see what scheme SBI proposes to save Yes Bank.

CHENNAI: The Enforcement Directorate (ED) has levied a fine of Rs 5 crore on truck financier Shriram Transport Finance Company Ltd (STFC), for breach of of provisions under the Foreign Exchange Management Act where share warrants were issued to a person in violation .

The fine was imposed on erstwhile Shriram Holdings (Madras) Private Limited (SHMPL) that later merged with STFC (in 2012). The ED has also levied penalty of Rs 50 lakh each on three former directors of SHMPL.

STFC has said it is examining the order and will examine all options — including contesting — to take the matter to closure. In a statement to exchanges, STFC said, “The company represented itself with relevant information and facts that it was of the bona fide view that it had not contravened any of the provisions of FEMA. However, we received an order dated March 4, 2020 from ED yesterday (March 9, 2020). The order imposes on penalty of Rs 5 crore in connection with the above matter citing contravention of provisions of Section 6(3)(b) of FEMA, 1999 read with Regulation 4 of Foreign Exchange Management (Transfer or Issue of Security by a Person Resident outside India) Regulations, 2000.”

The company said it continues to believe that it had relevant approval for foreign equity participation of up to 74% by way of investment through subscription and subsequent acquisition of up to 74% of the equity shares of SHMPL.

SHMPL issued warrants to the extent of Rs 243.6 crore in 2006 which were converted into equity shares within the above-mentioned limit.

34,['11/03/2020'],Entrepreneurs know they will not always get it right,"By Prabir Jha

In my new life of advising companies and coaching their leaders in an ever-turbulent world, I see a new synonym being created. Leadership , in many ways, is like entrepreneurship. Whether it is search for talent or internal identification, coaching or development, everyone seems to ask for help to build entrepreneurial leaders.

As I have been reflecting on this rising trend in organisations, one cannot but notice that not all entrepreneurship is always about running a business. Entrepreneurship is really a philosophy, a culture, a mindset. It is the ability to create impact in whatever one does in an enterprise in the face of constraints, risks and ambiguity.

My belief is that entrepreneurship is then function-agnostic. Then leadership development must become a journey of nurturing entrepreneurship, and build new-age leaders to behave more like entrepreneurs — beyond titles and boxes.

* Leadership is not a right, it is a business: Today, no one accepts you just because of your visiting card. Like entrepreneurship, you have to build your acceptance and reputation brick by brick. There are no cookie-cutter options. You flex, change, make mistakes and, of course, correct by the moment. Your style of yesterday may not have a taker today. You need to get some returns on your leadership to build the ability to play bigger stakes. Build leadership capital by the appropriate leadership behaviour from early on.

* You need to toggle between the balcony and the dance floor: Every entrepreneur knows you need to think strategically, but execute the grind. Leadership is likewise. You need to think the inspiring big picture, but also act out the small daily acts of behaviour to make that leadership come to life. There is no grand strategy if your small near-term leadership expressions bounce. Make every opportunity count to demonstrate wholesome leadership, not just angular functional expertise.

* Take your risks in a world of ambiguity: Entrepreneurship is about reading the context, identifying the opportunity and executing on that promise. Leadership too is contextual. One needs to identify what is the opportunity or accent of leadership that is most wanted. It is to flex both your style or encourage a wider deployment of leadership behaviour that fills that void. Done well, it builds leadership reputation that works. One needs to remember lessons but pick the appropriate strokes, even beyond the textbook. The ability to read the nuance of the context of leadership is like a smart entrepreneur’s read of the possibility.

* Fail fast, learn fast: Entrepreneurs know they will not always get it right every time. But they typically fail fast, learn from their mistakes and are swift to make course-corrections as needed. Leadership is no different. Sometimes a particular style of leadership does not work. Smart leaders change their approach to what may work. They reflect on the learning and learn their lessons well for the future.

* Scarce resources but imaginative opportunity seizing: No entrepreneur starts with infinite resources. There are enough naysayers and sceptics advising them. They persist in their resolve. They reimagine possibilities. Their #OptimismQuotient is high. Same with leadership. It does not need huge resources. It needs honest deployment of intent. Small little things reap huge leadership reputation. They make every opportunity at leadership count. They stay positive and optimistic despite the temptations of short-term aberrations of behaviour. And the returns they finally get is a windfall where their reputation precedes their resume.

Anyone who aspires to be an entrepreneur of leadership must then think entrepreneurship. The aspiration must not rest with getting an official tag or title of a leader. It must persist in the larger purpose of building leadership. And organisations can unblock their bureaucracies and unleash energy and possibilities if they can redesign their leadership development on an entrepreneurship algorithm.

The temple occupies an important place on the Sabarimala pilgrimage map. The procession, tableau, entertainment programmes etc, which are part of festival, were cancelled. The distribution of prasadam and payasam at the ghat where aarattu is held was also cancelled.

According to the administrative officer of the temple, O G Biju, devotees were apprised about the seriousness of the situation. “Devaswom commissioner and the district collector had advised us to cut down the celebrations and hold just the ritual. We decided to implement the advice after convincing devotees,” he said.

38,['11/03/2020'],Court seeks officials’ views on footpath construction,"Kochi: Kochi is a metro city only in its name, the Kerala high court said on Tuesday.

Criticizing the practice of autorickshaw stands taking over footpaths, Justice Devan Ramachandran said the road belongs to pedestrians too. The court also asked how pedestrians can pass through North overbridge.

Further, the court criticized that action is taken only when some accident occurs. The court highlighted the need of constructing proper footpaths from Kaloor to Kacheripady and asked the authorities to inform their views about it.

During the hearing, Kerala water authority (KWA) informed the court that pipe-laying work on SRM Road has been completed and that the road has been handed over to Kochi corporation for tarring. The corporation has been entrusted with Rs 11.79 crore for road repairing and the road would be tarred by the end of this month, KWA informed. At the previous hearing, the court had highlighted the plight of residents along SRM Road due to the works.

Responding to the submission, the court said there should be a system for digging up or cutting the road, filling up the pits, and then relaying it. “Authorities should remember that we are living in the 21st century,” the judge said while pointing out that the situation at Ponnurunni Road is no different than SRM Road.

41,['11/03/2020'],50% in Chullikal ready to switch to solar power,"Kochi: Kochi corporation conducted a sample survey in Chullickal to check out the awareness and inclination of the ward residents to embrace the Union government’s solar city project. Kochi is one of the 60 Indian cities identified for the project.

The local body will implement the project in 2,000 houses in the ward through the Kochi Solar Cell set up for the purpose. The sample survey looked at the people’s interest in installing solar powered equipment in their homes and whether they were inclined to cut down energy consumption. The study found that only 50% people, most of them middle-income groups, are interested in switching to solar power.

Those who expressed reluctance did so in the belief that they could not afford the costs. Most of them were unaware of the various subsidies available for the solar installations. Hence, the study recommended that awareness programmes and campaigns are needed to be conducted in the ward to make the residents aware of the importance of using renewable energy and to make them aware of various subsidies available.

An energy survey can help assess the energy consumption of the ward, provide strategies to improve existing energy utilization in an efficient manner. The ward is a residential area with 10 resident associations and each of the 10 associations have around 150-200 buildings units. It has 61 commercial centres and 12 institutions in the ward. A sample survey was done in 350 residentials buildings.

One of the most positive aspects of the study was that 88% said that they use electricity carefully to cut power bills and many have shifted to using LEDs and ornamental lights. But there were very few takers as of now for solar water heaters and panels.

The total energy requirement of the domestic sector in the division is around 5,20,000 Kwh per month. The average energy consumption, according to the survey is 228 Kwh.

The study found that on an average, each residence will require a 2KW solar system. Based on the energy requirement of the house, the required capacity of solar system can vary from 1-5 KW.

According to the survey, installing a grid connected system will be a much feasible option for the area. The total project cost will be Rs 14.56 crore.

Corporation officials said after an awareness workshop, a project would be submitted to agency for non-conventional energy and rural technology for approval and after online submission, installation of solar system in each residence.

Dr Shyamalan, who worked at a private clinic in Thalikkulam, had claimed that she had lost her job after informing government officials about a patient who visited the clinic with suspected symptoms of coronavirus infection. She had posted on social media said that the patient came to the clinic without adopting precautions (like wearing a mask) and that he later left for Qatar. She said that she had alerted the police, health authorities and informed the public about him through social media and television.

However, hospital authorities allegedly terminated my job after that incident as they feared that the visit of a suspect Covid-19 patient would reduce the flow of other patients, she claimed. Dr Shyamalan claimed that she had not divulged the identity of the patient or the hospital. “My only anxiety was that samples should have been collected for tests before his departure to Qatar. Then we would have known whether he was infected or not, she said.

Officials at the district medical office said the patient she had referred to was already under observation and was given permission to leave after it was found that he had not developed symptoms during the surveillance period. But, DMO Dr KJ Reena said this particular patient had come to Kerala on January 31 and he had gone back 10 days after the extended quarantine period of 28 days.

Officials alleged that she tried to tarnish the hard work and services rendered by personnel in the health sector and raking up an unnecessary controversy for publicity.

But the lack of maintenance and awareness among the public about how to use the equipment is damaging the gym, which may soon face a shutdown. The gym has now become a kids’ play zone where most of the equipment are used as playthings.

The gym was set up at a cost of around Rs 54 lakh from the MLA fund of present Ernakulam MP Hibi Eden. One pedal of the cycle used for cardio-exercise was damaged. Some of the equipment, which are fixed to the ground, are now moving as the screws are loose.

Eden said unscientific use of the equipment will easily damage the gym and the public should be aware of it. “The gym was supposed to be a place where people can do exercise but unfortunately it has become a children’s park. The basic purpose of the gym is not being served. We are planning a children’s park in the area to prevent this. The maintenance of the equipment will be carried out immediately and I will ask the contractors to sort it out,” he said.

While the ban will immediately affect movement of labour traffic from Malda, Murshidabad and other Bengal districts to the Gulf, sources said it will also have an impact on flyers travelling to Europe or the Americas.“Though Indians can still transit Doha, the restrictions that have been imposed will make any traveller wary of travelling through the country. This is extremely unfortunate because Doha has in the past few years emerged as a popular stop-over point for travellers from Kolkata heading to Europe and the US. Qatar Airways offers attractive packages, either directly or through partner and subsidiary Discover Qatar . The airline also offer complementary hotel stay and city tours for flyers with long layovers. However, with the ban now in force, those taking onward connections will not be allowed to leave Hamad International Airport ,” an industry official said.Entry into Qatar for passengers travelling from India, Bangladesh, China, Egypt, Iran, Iraq, Lebanon, Nepal, Pakistan, Philippines, South Korea, Sri Lanka, Syria and Thailand was suspended on Monday as a preventive measure against the spread of Covid-19. The ban is on all individuals — visitors as well as those working or residing there.Kuwait had last week announced a similar restriction on Indians though India has not yet had a single Covid-19 related death. The number of affected Indians is 56, far less than what many countries have reported. Qatar has till now confirmed 15 cases.""Qatar Airways is working closely with global and national authorities to implement the latest advice and guidance on Covid-19 and operate our services accordingly. Due to the rise of nCoV cases around the world, we are placing a temporary hold on stopover services in Doha for the purpose of connection, booked through our partner and subsidiary, Discover Qatar, or booked directly through qatarairways.com . Passengers with onward connections will not be permitted to leave Hamad International Airport (HIA). All current stopover bookings will therefore be cancelled. A full refund will be offered,"" an airline spokesperson said.Aviation industry sources said the ban would hit Qatar Airways that operates over 100 flights a week to and from 13 Indian cities. Though the airline has not announced any immediate plans to rationalise flights to India, sources said the frequencies could be curtailed if traffic loads drop dramatically in the days ahead.The ban will also affect Indian carriers IndiGo, SpiceJet and Air India that have multiple connections between Doha and various Indian cities. IndiGo, which was scheduled to introduce a Doha connection from Kolkata, has hastily shelved the plan. GoAir had also planned flights to Doha but it will now be put on the backburner.

KOLKATA: Around 30,000 depositors in a south Kolkata neighbourhood are in a fix after an 88-year-old co-operative bank at Dhakuria stopped clearing their cheques, electronic clearing services (ECS) and loan repayment options last Thursday.

The Dhakuria Co-operative Bank Ltd at Tanupukur Road off Dhakuria station is one of the 50-odd sub-member type 2 banks that were associated with Yes Bank. Since last week, as per RBI direction, cheques of the co-operative bank has been barred from processing in outward and inward clearing.

Nestled in a quiet corner of Dhakuria, the bank was formed way back in 1932. Currently, it boasts of having 6,500 odd members with an account base ranging from well-placed professionals and businessmen to small-time traders and retired individuals that offers a unique 8am-8pm banking provision. The total bank deposit is now around Rs 80 crores. The sudden check in transaction has put all of them in a state of jeopardy. Most of them had no idea that their bank had anything to do with Yes Bank.

“I knew that RBI had superseded Yes Bank board and that it had become insolvent. But I had no clue my bank had anything to do with Yes Bank. I have a business of milk distribution in south Kolkata and almost every day cheques amounting to Rs 60,000 gets cleared from the co-operative bank. From Thursday, the cheques disbursed from this bank is getting bounced and apart from the penalty now I will have to pay, my reputation is at stake. I am planning to shift my account to some other bank now,” said Rana Dey, a resident of Ghoshpara in Dhakuria.

Another account holder, Asit Basu, said his ECS for telephone bill has been put on hold for the time being and like several other customers, he was also at the bank on Tuesday to discuss the way forward. “As of now, we can still withdraw and deposit money. They have said that there is no bar on NEFT and RTGS clearance but no cheque transaction or ECS facility is available for now,” said Basu, who lives two blocks from the bank.

An urban co-operative bank is not a scheduled commercial bank . It is governed by RBI as well as partially by NABARD. They need a separate clearing house for their billing and transactions In case of the Dhakuria bank, while the cheque and ECS clearance was done by Yes Bank, the NEFT and RTGS transaction are done by a nationalised bank.

“We began operation with Yes Bank around four years ago and till date, we had no problem with them. The kind of technological support they had provided us was unprecedented. But in this current situation, even we are in a fix if we will continue to wait for RBI’s decision or shift our clearance bank. For the last few days, I have been receiving multiple applications from private and nationalised banks who are willing to act as our clearing houses. We will wait for a few days and then if needed, we will change our clearing house,” said Susanta Kumar Basu, the branch manager.

KOCHI: The Queen’s Walkway in Chathiyath Road , one of the busiest waterfront hangout spots in the city, may soon lose its sheen, mainly due to misuse and lack of proper maintenance.

The main problem is the dumping of garbage along the opposite side of the road near the walkway. Scores of stray dogs also pose a challenge for joggers and walkers. In addition, a majority of the steel chairs are in a dilapidated condition and steel rods of the chairs have been removed by miscreants.

Many of the lights on the southern part of the walkway are not functional and the radio system has become non-operational long ago. Illegal parking of buses, trucks and cranes on the service road, meant for the parking of visitor’s vehicles, is another issue. Moreover, excise officials said the walkway has become a hub for drug peddlers who use the crowd as a cover for their deals.

Officials of Goshree Islands Development Authority (GIDA), which oversees the walkway, said that overhaul of the electrical and CCTV systems was getting delayed due to lack of funds.

“Most of the lights were revamped recently, but a few are still not functioning. CCTV cameras were installed using MLA funds but no maintenance has been done so far due to lack of funds. Only five of the 24 cameras are not working. We will raise these issues in the next meeting with collector, who is GIDA secretary,” said a GIDA official.

Hibi Eden, Ernakulam MP, who implemented the CCTV project when he was MLA, said that the lifecycle of the CCTV cameras would have reduced because of absence of periodic maintenance. “If remedial steps are not taken, the walkway will lose its name,” said Eden.

Since January 22, when the Disha call centre was activated in the state to deal with inquiries about novel coronavirus, they have received 5,371 calls.

Around 50% of callers wanted to know who should be home quarantined and what is home quarantine or if its safe to travel.

Besides knowing about whether it is safe to travel within the state, many Malayalis abroad in Dubai, Singapore, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Malaysia and New Zealand are keen to know if it is safe to come to Kerala now, and whether they will be home quarantined or sent to an isolation ward on arrival in Kerala.

Disha call centre is an initiative of the Kerala government and National Health Mission and started functioning in 2013. It acts as a 24X7 helpline of the health department in any emergency situations.

“Most of the calls are from educated and middle-aged persons who are confused about Covid-19, mainly due to the fake news circulating on social media. We clear their doubts and provide them with correct information on Covid-19,” said Akhila V Nair, manager, Disha call centre.

About 25% callers to the helpline wanted to know about the symptoms of Covid-19 and 10% were panic calls, keen to know if they have Covid-19 if they suffer from cold. Another 10% calls were to inform about a neighbour who has travelled to corona-affected countries.

Rest of the calls were from people who had returned from foreign countries and had not reported to the health department. The call-centre personnel note down their details and inform the officials concerned.

There are a few routine calls inquiring about precautions that need to be taken to prevent Covid-19.

With more cases of persons being tested for Covid-19, the number of calls to the helpline has increased. On Monday, after a few cases were reported across the state, the helpline had received about 850 calls, with majority of calls from Ernakulam (124), followed by Kottayam (83) and Thiruvananthapuram (72). There were 40 calls from Pathanamthitta. Least number of calls were from Wayanad (6) and Kasaragod (4).

Criticizing the surveillance systems’ quality, the councillors pointed out to several incidents of travellers who visited corona-affected countries not coming under the surveillance of the authorities.

In one such an incident in Pottakkuzhi, a youth who returned from Italy three or four days ago hadn't reported about his travel history to the health authorities. On Tuesday, the division councillor who came to know about it, informed health officials. “I informed the health department officials. There are many such incidents,” said Jimini, councillor from Pottakkuzhi division.

“A couple from the area, had come in the flight with the family in Pathanamthitta (some of who have been tested positive for the virus) on February 29. Following reports that some of the members of the Pathanamthitta family who returned home from Italy and tested positive for Covid-19, the couple from Pottakkuzhi contacted me,” Jimini said.

I informed about the development to the health department officials. Now, the wife has been admitted to the isolation ward of Government Medical College, Ernakulam for flu,” Jimini said.

The councillors said similar cases have been reported from other parts of the city. “A few days ago, a youth returned home to Fort Kochi from Italy. He is the son of a sexton in Fort Kochi and he and his family members failed to inform the neighbours about his arrival. When we came to know about it, we informed the health department. Now, the youth is under surveillance,” said K J Antony, opposition leader, Kochi Corporation.

Health standing committee chairperson Pratibha Ansari said some more councillors have brought similar issues to her notice. “I have passed on the details to the health department,” Ansari said.

Antony Francis, a councillor from Chullickal, said there were several people who have returned from locations such as Italy and Jerusalem. “The authorities are in the dark about the details of such travellers. Though I sought the details of such patients from health department, they said don’t have it,” Francis said.

Similarly, there were reports that a group of 40-odd people from Vaduthala returned from Italy a few days ago. However, the councillor from the division said the group didn’t visit Italy. “They visited places like Jerusalem. On Monday, a team of health officials visited them. Officials said that none of them have shown the symptoms of the disease,” said O P Sunil, councillor from Vaduthala.

It was also decided to take urgent measures to ensure that all safety and sanitation facilities are being provided to drivers of ambulances, which are engaged in transporting persons with suspected cases.As of now, there are around five ambulances, which transport persons with symptoms of Covid-19 from Cochin International Airport Ltd (Cial) to the medical college.

On Tuesday, TOI had carried an article which highlighted the situation where unsanitized ambulances were being used for shifting persons with symptoms of Covid-19. The report had also explained the difficulties faced by the ambulance drivers. “Now, only one person will be transported to the medical college at a time, so that persons with Covid-19 symptoms won’t come in contact with each other. Besides, more facilities to ensure the safety and hygiene of ambulance drivers will be provided,” said Suhas.

So, it may take one or two days, in certain cases, to get the ambulances sanitized,” they said in the complaint. The drivers demanded a dedicated agency for cleaning the ambulances.The drivers, who are deployed for the duty continuously, are not given any special uniforms, PPE kit and N 95 masks.

HYDERABAD: The Telangana high court on Tuesday issued notices to the state government and transport commissioner wondering why bank guarantee was reduced from Rs 1 crore to Rs 5 lakh for dealers who were authorised to procure and fix speed governors for heavy commercial vehicles.

Justice Abhinand Kumar Shavili also issued notices to 16 dealers and sought answers from them within two weeks while hearing a petition from a manufacturer of speed governors.

PVA Padmanabham, counsel for the petitioner, said the government was claiming that it was a policy decision without first explaining the grounds upon which it fixed Rs 1 crore guarantee initially and reduced it to Rs 5 lakh a few weeks ago all of a sudden. “People who do not have adequate facilities to procure and fix the speed governors are also given the task of fitting them,” he argued.

The case will come up for hearing after two weeks.

The counsel said while new vehicles that are being sold have in-built speed governors, for the vehicles that are operating the Centre had fixed certain parameters. These define the type of speed governor to be fitted and the dealer who would fix it.

A Supreme Court committee headed by Justice Radhakrishnan had imposed fool-proof encrypting methods to ensure that the same speed governor purchase receipt would not be used for multiple vehicles. Also, details of all such vehicles which were fitted with speed governors should be uploaded into the Centre’s Vahan data website.

Though Telangana does not follow the Vahan data mode, it has issued a notification for implementing Rule 118 of the Central Motor Vehicle Rules which make speed governors mandatory.

However, some manufacturers argued problems arose with the entry of middlemen into the trade who started dictating terms. The price of a speed governor is between Rs 1,800 and Rs 2,000. However, Rs 6000 and above was charged per each speed governor.

“It was these middlemen who were instrumental in getting the specific guarantee performance to be furnished by select dealers reduced to Rs 5 lakh from Rs 1 crore,” the manufacturers said.

When the bank guarantee was Rs 1 crore, there were only three dealers. Thanks to the drastic reduction in the bank guarantee amount, the number of dealers who were selected has gone up to 17. “But, the price of speed governor remained at Rs 6,000 and above,” they contended.

The manufacturers alleged that money minted in this manner would cross Rs 140 crore, going by the number (3.5 lakh) of commercial vehicles in Telangana which are operating sans speed governors.

52,['11/03/2020'],Scrap 1-min rule at Inter exam centre: PIL,"Representative image

HYDERABAD: An advocate filed a PIL in the Telangana high court on Tuesday, urging the court to scrap a circular issued by the Telangana State Board of Intermediate Education ( TSBIE ) on disallowing students from taking the exam if they are late even by a minute.

The Intermediate public exams start at 9 am and students entering the exam centre at 9.01 am are also not allowed inside as per the new rule.

The petitioner said, in his plea, that TSBIE had brought this ‘one-minute late rule’ without taking into consideration the practical problems. “This rule is adversely affecting the students and their future. Hence, it deserves to be quashed,” he contended.

His counsel Abhilasha made a mention before a bench of Chief Justice Raghavendra Singh Chauhan and Justice A Abhishek Reddy informing it about their petition and sought an urgent hearing on the ground that the rule was adversely affecting poor students, who were not able to make it to the examination centres on time and late by a few minutes.

The bench asked the counsel to complete the process of filing the plea before making a mention. The petition was later filed. Bhaskar told the media later that they would make a mention before the bench on Wednesday again with a request to take up the case as poor students were adversely hit on account of the rule.

“There are certain things like bad roads, ill health, distress at home, etc., which are not in the hands of the students,” he said. Added to this, the board was locating the exam centres far away from the colleges of the students. “Also, there are mistakes pertaining to communication printed on hall-tickets,” he said.

He said the board should concentrate more on creating awareness among students on the need to arrive early. “Though it spoke about a mobile application that helps the students and their parents locate the exam centres, not many parents know about it,” he said.

“More over, the one minute late rule has no legal basis,” he added.

“Decision for the RS seat was taken by the chief minister and deputy chief minister as deputy coordinator and coordinator of the AIADMK,” he said and added that there has not been any statement from them (DMDK) and there is no need to clarify on this. If a situation arose they (DMDK) will be called for talks.

On the accident that claimed the lives of three people on the sets of Kamal Hassan-starrer ‘Indian 2’, the minister said his department is conducting tripartite talks with the producers’ council and crew members.

He expressed confidence that the outcome of the series of meetings would help avert such accidents in future and that the government alone cannot act on it. Backing Kamal’s statement, the minister said that “we have learnt a lesson” from the crane accident that left three people dead.

Major firms have introduced a travel freeze in the wake of the spike in global Covid-19 cases and are relying on technology for communication.

Alexander Varghese, chief operating officer of UST Global, said that all IT firms have business continuity plans and have devised strategies to deal with the situation. “Most of the companies have introduced a travel freeze and have switched to audio or video conferencing. Of course, there will be exceptions. All employees are given proper awareness on precautionary measures. Those who have travelled to affected countries are advised home quarantine. Also, those planning vacations to foreign countries are asked to stay at home. Work-from-home options are accorded to persons from affected areas. Employees are co-ordinating with their managers on necessary measures,” he said.

Kerala IT Parks CEO Sasi P M said the situation has not affected business in the sector so far. “Even before the Covid-19 outbreak, many companies were encouraging work-from-home options. So it is not a concern for several IT firms. However, international travel restrictions will affect client visits and marketing-related work. So far, the spread of the virus has not affected the sector, but if it continues, the situation might change,” he said.

Sasi said that necessary precautions, as per the directive of health department, have been adopted at IT parks, where large numbers of employees work together. Housekeeping sections are advised to take proper sanitization measures.

The Kerala Startup Mission has postponed crucial visits of delegates from countries like US and Japan. It has also postponed around 15 events planned across the state.

With employee safety utmost on the minds of firms, some technologies, including biometric access, are being discouraged. Most companies have stopped using biometric punching as a security measure.

69,['11/03/2020'],Guarding the skies: No challenge too big for country’s air warrior,"Secunderabad: Air Vice Marshal Sagar Bharti (rtd) spent 36 years of his life serving the country.

As the air officer commanding (AOC) at Air Force Station, Yelahanka, Bengaluru, he was tasked with locating the helicopter that had gone missing with the then chief minister of Andhra Pradesh, YS Rajasekhara Reddy, and some officials.

“We deployed over a dozen helicopters and nearly 80 IAF personnel, including technical staff were on the job of locating the missing helicopter,” Bharti recalled in a conversation with TOI. Sagar Bharti was ready with a plan of action. The search and rescue operation zeroed in on a certain area and came across the helicopter which had crashed.

All five on board had died. “We got out commandos to slither down with a rope and retrieve the mortal remains,” Sagar Bharti said. He himself flew the mortal remains in an Indian Air Force (IAF) helicopter to Hyderabad and then later to Idupulapaya in Kadapa where the burial of the chief minister took place.

Sagar Bharti admits that flying in different terrain and weather needs skill and in hostile conditions, it can be even more challenging. “In Sri Lanka where the IPKF carried out operations against the LTTE, my helicopter with 20 troops was targeted and shot at. That was the closest I came to a war-like situation. But I landed the helicopter without much of a problem though the helicopter suffered 20 bullet shots ,” he recalled.

Following in his footsteps, his son, Sangam Bharti too joined the IAF. Flt Lt Sangam Bharti is also married to an IAF pilot – Flt Lt Saanya.

During his career in the IAF, Sagar Bharti has flown prime ministers Rajiv Gandhi, Atal Behari Vajpayee, IK Gujral, Presidents APJ Abdul Kalam, Giani Zail Singh and union ministers including George Fernandez and Rajnath Singh. He also had a diplomatic posting as air attache at Ukraine.

“Glamorous as it sounded, in order to become a pilot in the IAF the training that one had to undergo was tough,” Sagar Bharti recalled. And that training helped in discharging many functions including undertaking rescue missions during floods in Andhra Pradesh and Gorakhpur (UP) , shifting casualties in J&K, dropping troops in Sri Lanka, playing a role in the Kargil war and in insurgency areas in the north east. “The high altitude and the jungle terrain were a challenge and flying there during my very first posting gave me more confidence,” he recollected.

Was just his training enough to react to emergencies and handle challenging situations? To this Air Vice Marshal Sagar Bharti says, “Human nature is such that when you come across such emergencies, there is a biological clock which automatically gets ticked off and you ensure the safety of people.” He also credited his training and experience as valuable assets.

One of the highlights of his career was receiving and flying former President APJ Abdul Kalam. “He was my hero,” he says describing Kalam.

Sagar Bharti was commanding air force station in Thoise, the northernmost base of IAF and Kalam was the first president to visit this base and Siachen. “As President, he was supreme commander of the armed forces and he spent an entire day with the troops which was a great source of encouragement,” he recalled.

HYDERABAD: After the 43-year-old anaesthetist Ravindra Kumar shot himself at his villa in Saket-Mithila of Kapra on Monday, his wife has told the police that she had to run out of the house on Sunday night as Ravinder assaulted her.

Dr Smitha told police that Ravinder had asked her to accompany him to his elder brother’s newly purchased house in Tellapur. However, as Smitha was not ready to go, Ravindra Kumar went to the house alone at around 3 pm on Sunday.

“Ravindra Kumar had dinner with his family members and returned home at around 9 pm. After returning, he started consuming liquor and picked up an argument with his wife for not accompanying him to his brother’s house. During the argument, he assaulted her twice. Rattled with his behaviour, she ran her out of the house and went to a doctor couple in her neighbourhood. The other family dropped Smitha at her parent’s house in Dilsukhnagar,” a police official from Rachakonda commissionerate said.

Smitha did not take her phone with her while leaving the house. Subsequently, Ravindra Kumar called his 12-year-old son - who was already at his grandparent’s house since Saturday night - at around 2 am.

“Smitha answered her son’s phone. After hearing her voice, he disconnected the call. We have sought the details of Ravindra Kumar’s call details,” Kushaiguda ACP K Shiva Kumar said.

After preliminary probe, police has said that Ravinder’s hospital business was not going well. Police has also revealed that the anaesthetist had obtained the weapon’s license after he received threats from members of a pseudo naxal gang in 2017. “In 2016, a pseudo naxal gang was arrested for threatening businessmen and doctors like Ravindra Kumar for money. Fearing threat from the gang members, Dr Ravindra Kumar applied for gun license and he got it in 2017,” the inspector said.

Ravinder Kumar was the MD of Shri Adithya Hospital in Dammaiguda and Dr Smitha worked there as a gynaecologist.

The seized contraband would fetch more than Rs 1 crore in the international drug market, according to the officials. The hashish oil was stored in two sealed bottles of a coconut oil brand.

The squad officers also arrested two men, who were transporting the substance. The identified are Sudheesh (27), and Justin P Mathew alias Vava (32). Both men are residents of Melukavu in Meenachil taluk in Kottayam district. They were caught from a lodge at Eanchakkal.

The contraband they were carrying was sourced from a wholesale ganja dealer based in Narsipatnam village, Visakhpatnam in Andhra Pradesh.

The excise officers said that Sudheesh was a habitual offender, who was involved in the sale of narcotic substances for the past few years. In the past, he used to conduct his business in Bengaluru. But last year, he was arrested by the Bengaluru police following which he had to spend two months in prison. Following his arrest, he lost all his trusted contacts in Bengaluru. That was when his wholesale dealer in Narsipatnam advised him to shift his operations to Kerala, especially Kochi and Thiruvananthapuram.

The two accused were held following a reliable tip-off received by excise circle inspector T Anikumar who leads the state excise enforcement squad. He was assisted by circle inspector G Krishnakumar and excise inspector T R Mukesh Kumar.

85,['11/03/2020'],Lakshadweep: A lesson in gratitude,"If you are a person who finds solace in the sun and sand, and longs for the tranquil blue of the ocean, then ditch Goa and Andamans and head to Lakshadweep for your next vacation. This island Union Territory of India in the Arabian Sea is twice as beautiful and half as commercialised.

I embarked a cruise that took me to Kavaratti, Minicoy and Kalpeni. I could relax in the secluded, clean beaches for as long as I wished. I was able to swim in the ocean, snorkel and scuba dive. Moreover, I had the opportunity to see, touch and feel the world underneath, with the tiny fish that flutter vivaciously around their colourful homes: the corals. Watching the sun set in the offing, while the breeze caresses your hair and the cool sand seeps through your toes was truly a serene and calming experience.

My travel experience also included a cultural interaction with the locals, where they presented a few traditional dances and songs. Later, we were distributed local snacks which were so delicious that we absolutely had to sneak a second helping.

The native islanders fish and work predominantly in the coconut and tourism industry. But what intrigued me most was the fact that even with the bare minimum that they survive on, they seemed satisfied and happy. There are no lavish bungalows and malls in Lakshadweep, just humble hutments and shops. They do make you wonder about the futility of constantly wanting more out of everything in life. The ostentatious lifestyle of the mainland has not yet infected the island territory and that is where its beauty lies. The people there are content with what they have; they focus on community growth, prospering not with wealth but with the collective support of each other.

The beauty of Lakshadweep lies in the ability of its people to be grateful for the little things. This was one life lesson that I got from my calming sojourn to the picturesque islands of Lakshadweep.

Lieutenant governor Kiran Bedi while welcoming the ‘long-awaited’ move said the decision will boost the morale of the Puducherry police force.

Bedi said the focus of the police force must be on eradicating rowdyism and land-grab in any form.

“The increased police presence will strengthen the effectiveness of Puducherry police in all four regions of the UT. A comprehensive training plan has been organised for them by the police headquarters,” she said.

The Lieutenant governor attributed the promotion to the close coordination between the leadership in the home and police departments. “I congratulate the chief secretary and the DGP and their team for having diligently worked through the process,” Bedi said.

HYDERABAD: US ambassador to India Kenneth I Juster attended a ceremony for the completion of all major structural components of the new consulate compound in Hyderabad on Tuesday. He announced that the compound would be completed by Fall 2021.

“I’m pleased to see progress at the new US Consulate Compound in Hyderabad,” said the ambassador at the “Topping Out” ceremony. He thanked the Telangana government and minister KTR for all the support given for the US Consulate General in Hyderabad.

Spread across more than 12 acres, the multi-building consulate complex is located at Nanakramguda in the Financial District. An estimated $33 million is being invested in the local economy throughout the duration of the project. and an estimated workforce of over 1,000 American, Indian, and third-country workers are involved in construction. The project budget is $350.5 Million.

Further, Juster also announced completion of a US-funded restoration project at the 17th century Qutb Shahi Tombs through the Ambassadors Fund for Cultural Preservation (AFCP).

In February 2019, Juster announced a $103,000 grant through the AFCP, partnering with the Aga Khan Foundation to restore and conserve the centuries-old tombs of Taramati and Premamati within the greater Qutb Shahi Tombs complex.

This is the second grant awarded by the US Government for conservation work at the Qutb Shahi Tombs. An earlier AFCP grant of $101,000, awarded in 2014, contributed to mapping and documenting structures throughout the site and helped transform archeologists’ understanding of the monument’s earliest architecture.

Stating that it was very important to restore and protect the city’s heritage, Juster said, “This is my third visit to the tombs and I am delighted to see that they have been restored successfully.”

NASHIK: The Nashik unit of the state Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has kicked off random checks of medical stores in the district to ensure that face masks and hand sanitisers are not sold at a premium.

The agency officials have warned of cancelling the licences of stores if they are found involved in black-marketing of these items.

There are over 4,000 drug stores across the district. “It is not possible for the FDA squads to check each store. Therefore, we are carrying out random inspections and seeking customer feedback to prevent the sale of these items at prices more than the MRP. The demand for both face masks and hand sanitisers in Nashik has gone up by about 10%. So far, there have been no complaints,” said the FDA sources.

According to the officials, there is no scarcity of these two items in the district. According to the Nashik Chemist and Druggist Association there is no significant rise in demand for face masks and sanitisers. “These two items are available at such stores that sell surgical items. We have also directed our members not to sell these items at higher prices,” the association members added.

91,['11/03/2020'],Trash pile cleared after student airs grievance on TOI app,"Hyderabad: On Sunday, V Bhavya Reddy, a class 7 student, downloaded TOI’s Citizen Reporter app and reported about a garbage pile near her house. On Monday, the very day the report was published, civic authorities cleared the trash from the locality. The garbage had piled up at Gandhi Nagar, Kavadiguda, and even the bins were not emptied.

Niranjan Reddy, father of the girl, said that it was his daughter who downloaded the app and aired the apathy on his name.

“My daughter is a TOI reader. She was aware about the garbage menace in our locality and on Sunday she aired the apathy using the app,” said Reddy, adding, “Apart from the mosquito menace, we were forced to bear with the foul smell emanating from the garbage. I thank TOI and GHMC for clearing the garbage.”

GHMC officials said that ensuring sanitation on selected main roads is the responsibility of private agencies. Some main roads are handed over to private agencies under comprehensive road maintenance programme (CRMP) and sanitation on those stretches is the responsibility of those agencies.

“Though the onus of keeping the localities clean under CRMP is on the private agencies, we keep track of sanitation and also co-ordinate with them to ensure a clean city,” said Hemalatha, GHMC assistant medical officer of health (Musheerabad circle).

A senior citizen from Kavadiguda said that the bins need to be relocated. “The bins have been placed outside a few buildings. I request the authorities to deploy additional vehicles for door-to-door collection of garbage and would urge them to relocate the bins,” he said.

Residents also complain that as the garbage is not cleared regularly, the road gets dirty when the bins are full and the waste overflows on to the streets. “The place looks like a mini dump yard,” said M Sindhuri, a resident of Gandhi Nagar.

92,['11/03/2020'],Puducherry CM V Narayanasamy urges PM Modi to ensure women’s bill is passed,"V Narayanasamy

PUDUCHERRY: Chief minister V Narayanasamy on Tuesday urged Prime Minister Narendra Modi to ensure passing legislation to reserve 33% for women in Parliament and state legislatures . He was speaking at the international women’s day celebrations organised by the department of women and child development in the presence of lieutenant governor Kiran Bedi and others on Tuesday.

Narayanasamy said that the previous Congress-led UPA government in the Centre made concrete efforts to introduce women’s bill in Parliament. Rajya Sabha passed the bill in 2010 but the bill could not be passed in the Lok Sabha, he said.

“The present government in the Centre enjoys a majority. I urge Prime Minister Modi to pass the bill reserving 33% seats for women in Parliament and state legislatures,” Narayanasamy said.

He said Puducherry’s sex ratio (1,050 women for every 1,000 men) stands testimony that the territory remains the safe place for women. Female voters outnumber male voters by 30,000 to 40,000 in the territory, he said.

He claimed that violence against women has come down after the government gave strict direction to the police department to tackle the crimes with an iron hand. He was of the strong opinion that violence against women can be curbed only through stringent punishment to the offenders. He said the government has passed legislation to conclude trial in rape cases and award punishment within three months. But there are instances of delay in executing the punishment for the convicted people, he regretted while pointing out the Nirbhaya case.

The government has launched a mobile application for women’s safety He said the government has proposed to extend 50% reservation for women in education and in future will consider extending 50% reservation for women in employment too.

Bedi listed out the strengths of the Puducherry administration in ensuring the safety of the women in the territory. She said Puducherry has a high-quality family counselling centres, good health care system with medical stories sponsored by the Puducherry and Union governments, excellent anganwadi systems to take care of women and children and a good number of women police officers and constables among others.

She said Puducherry has considerably higher women’s literacy rate and pointed out that educated and employed women focus more on educating their children.

She urged the women to make use of every opportunity and take an active part in the polls to the local bodies.

Earlier welfare minister M Kandasamy threatened to resign if Bedi failed to address the issues in his department within a period of three months. He also submitted a memorandum in this regard to her during the celebrations.

I have a corporate meeting overseas and must travel to the US via Dubai. What precautions should I take? Is wearing a N95 mask enough while travelling? – SK Sinha

There is no firm evidence to suggest that origin of Covid-19 is from bats. It is not easy to explain why the three originated from China. It may be just a chance, especially as there are more number of people in China or their food habits that can bring zoonotic bugs in context of human. Virus cannot survive outside the host for long. They stay alive on surfaces like tables, chairs, etc. for a while. In warm weather this survival reduces considerably, so it is expected that in summer the spread will be much lower. However, there is no scientific evidence yet to support this.Phone cleaning may not be of much use, simply keeping in pocket will be enough. Best is not to touch mouth/face/nose/eyes without washing the hands with soap, keep distance from people with symptoms and avoid gatherings/crowded places.No, it is not likely, but always better to avoid mosquitoes for other reasons.I understand, Gandhi Hospital in Hyderabad is one of the Government of India centres for Covid-19 test. There may be small hitches but so far system has responded well, and prevention of spread is the best strategy.No need to worry if you take precautions that are generally recommended. Hospital that is accepting Covid-19 patients is not more dangerous than any other hospital or crowded place, as such patients are kept in isolated wards/rooms and additional precautions are in place (that way they may be relatively safer!).There is no need to worry about this, as there are ways to avoid/prevent catching infection by taking general precautions. There is no drug or vaccine, but the infection is generally defeated by our immune system. Only older people or people with other health conditions are at risk, they need to take additional precaution or medical attention. More than 80% of incidents are asymptomatic and people recover without needing any medical help.There is no scientific evidence to suggest that non-vegetarian food or ready-to-eat frozen imported items are means of Covid-19 spread. It is safer to eat healthy and freshly heated food items to ensure neutralising any accidental presence of infectious agents.N95 respirator face mask (costs around Rs 250) is advised for a person who is infected, to prevent the spread when person coughs/sneezes.It is difficult to rule out this. Increased hygienic practices and community action will be needed to control or see this off.In principle, yes, but there are no such reports yet as far as we know.Covid-19 symptoms that may appear two to 14 days after exposure include,runny nose, fever, frequent sneezing and coughing, shortness of breath (all symptoms may not show in each case).1. Avoid going out, stay at home and maintain 3-4 feet distance from other people in your home as much as possible; stay in a separate room and use a separate bathroom, if available.2. Limit contact with your pets.3. Wear a face mask if you must be around other people.4. When you cough/sneeze, cover your mouth and nose with a tissue; immediately throw tissues in garbage; wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds; if that’s not available, clean with hand sanitizer that has at least 60% alcohol.5. Avoid sharing household items, including drinking cups, eating utensils, towels or even bedding. Wash these items thoroughly after using.6. Clean high-touch surfaces daily using a household cleaner or wipe. These include counters, table tops, doorknobs, bathroom fixtures, toilets, etc.Stay healthy, use vitamin supplements like vitamin C. Don’t panic or take stress. Relax by watching your favourite TV show, surfing internet, talking to friends on mobile. Most people recover and by self-quarantine prevent spread of infection. Continue monitoring your symptoms. If they worsen, such as you if you begin to have difficulty breathing, seek medical help.Covid-19 is reported to have emerged from the Chinese city of Wuhan and there are unconfirmed suggestions that it has zoonotic origin. There is no strong scientific evidence of any alternate host so far. There are indications that this virus is sensitive to higher temperatures, but it is not certain how much of help will the summer season be. Remember, lot of places are air-conditioned where temperature does not change with season.Here is what is known about Covid-19 and knowing this will help in taking precaution to prevent its spread:Person-to-person spread: The virus is thought to spread mainly from person-to-person, between people who are in close contact with one another (within about 6 feet) through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes. These droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby or possibly be inhaled into the lungs. People are thought to be most contagious when they are most symptomatic. However, some spread might be possible before people show symptoms; there have been reports of this occurring with this new coronavirus, but this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads.Spread from contact with contaminated surfaces or objects: It may be possible that a person can get Covid-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it (from an infected person who coughed/sneezed on the object) and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes, but this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads. The virus that causes Covid-19 seems to be spreading easily and sustainably in the community, known as community spread, in some affected locations.Take general precautions such as avoiding touching things. Don’t touch your face before washing your hands with soap or wiping with alcohol-based disinfectant (carry one in your hand bag). Mask is not of much use, it may be counter-productive as one tends to adjust it frequently by hand. Maintain 3-4 feet distance from people, if possible, and avoid venturing into crowded places.",hyderabad,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74571178,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-121081,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/no-scientific-evidence-to-suggest-non-vegetarian-food-causes-covid-19/articleshow/74567559.cms

In a historic move, the Malankara Jacobite Syrian Church has decided to serve bread and wine during mass to faithful in their hands. A pastoral letter regarding this has been sent by Thomas Mar Timotheos, metropolitan of Kottayam diocese, to all churches, priests and managing committee members.

The letter says that this is a temporary arrangement. Since the virus spreads through touch, handshakes are to be avoided as a greeting and replaced with the namaste.

It also instructed believers to put an end to kissing of hands and instead bow before the Bible or cross and relics before leaving church. The practice of smearing oil on the forehead from the oil lamp is to be avoided.

The Church has also made safety arrangements for the practice of confession. Towels which are used on the altar have to be changed after use. Those who have fever or cough will have to stay at home. Arrangements will have to be made for the faithful to wash their hands with soap before entering the churches, says the letter.

Meanwhile, Malankara Orthodox Syrian Church too have stopped all prayer meetings, Sunday school classes and public meetings other than mass on Saturdays and Sundays. The church has also sought lesser participation for funerals.

The Mar Thoma Church has suspended Sunday mass, church meetings and lent prayers till March 31.

The Thrissur archdiocese of the Syro-Malabar Church also appealed to believers to avoid programmes like conventions, oottuthirunal, and other celebrations where large number of people are likely to converge.

In a statement issued in Thrissur on Tuesday, archbishop Andrews Thazhath appealed to the believers to follow the directions of the government and health authorities to prevent Covid-19 infections.

HYDERABAD: It’s not the academically weak students who are approaching psychologists seeking help, but those scoring high marks are the ones who actually seem to be under tremendous stress.

Clinical psychologists say that they received calls from many Intermediate first year toppers asking if they would be among the toppers this year too. Likewise, many students, especially from the rural areas, are said to be approaching psychologists trying to know if they would be able to meet their parents’ or teachers’ expectations.

“A student called me and started crying. He said that he always topped in mathematics and his teacher is expecting him to score high marks even in the board exams,” said P Jawaharlal Nehru, a clinical psychologist, who mostly deals with students from rural areas. He said that despite preparing well and going through the syllabus thoroughly, students are worried that they might not reach their teacher’s expectations.

He said that he received calls from students from Mahabubnagar , Nirmal, Adilabad, West Godavari , Bhimavaram , Srikakulam, Sangareddy , and other towns and districts.

Seconding with Nehru, another clinical psychologist Anitha Are said that she received calls from state toppers in previous board examinations saying that they were afraid they might not be able to top in the exams this time.

Psychologists also said that students, their parents, and teachers, are also calling to ask if they can consume non-vegetarian food during the exam season, by what time a student should sleep, how to improve memory among various other things. “Many students want to know how they can improve their memory. All I could tell them is to revise thoroughly and take breaks while preparing so that they are not stressed out,” said Mazhar Ali, a senior psychiatrist, adding that he recommended meditation and breathing exercises for those facing anxiety issues.

Some of the other questions that are being asked by students, psychologists say, are how to always stay motivated, what will happen if pages are left empty in between answer scripts, among others. They said that many students were also worried about not performing well in Sanskrit examination, which is considered to be an easy subject.

In a letter to chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswami, state organiser of the farmers’ wing of the Tamil Manila Congress Puliyur A Nagarajan said that when traders are selling Nendran chips for Rs 400 per kg, the producers get just Rs 10 per kg. It shows the pathetic condition of farmers, he said.

“Farmers cultivate Nendran banana in thousands of acres in Trichy district. Earlier, we had a very good demand in Kerala and it is not the case now. So, the government should fix a minimum support price, so that farmers would not incur a loss. Otherwise, the government should procure the variety and serve it to children under the noon meal scheme. Even the government can distribute it to the children in the form of chips,” he told TOI.

The agriculture marketing department should create some awareness about the marketing condition to the farmers, so that they can limit production according to the market conditions, he further stated.

“The banana belts such as Trichy and Karur should be announced as a protected zone for promoting banana cultivation to create opportunities for value addition of the produce,” he added.

The cybercrime police, who have registered two offences in this regard, said a man from the Tidke Colony area lost Rs 5.26 lakh between Friday and Saturday.

The complainant said that he got a call from a person who took details of his bank account on the pretext of updating his online payment wallet and later withdrew Rs 5.26 lakh.

The cybercrime police said that such cases involving fraudsters making random calls to people on the pretext of being bank officials or representatives has become common.

After winning the trust of their victims, the fraudsters take the details of their bank accounts and later cheat them of their money.

Police said that of late, online fraudsters have been sending certain links to their victims while urging them to click on the same, which ends up a person losing money.

NASHIK: Vehicled being driven at high speeds at night have been causing the highest number of road accident-related fatalities in the district, revealed the Nashik Regional Transport Office (RTO) at a workshop organised by it in the city for RTO officials from across five districts in the division.

In the January 2013-August 2018 period, 2,316 people died in 2,879 road accidents that took place between midnight and 6 am, said the Nashik RTO officials. Though the number of vehicles on the road during this time is less, the fatalities are more.

In a recent accident, a 34-year-old biker died when he was knocked down by a speeding sports utility vehicle (SUV) in the Nashik Road area around 12.30 am on Monday. His wife, riding pillion, suffered head injuries and a fractured right leg and is currently admitted in a private hospital in Nashik city . The SUV’s speed was so great that the vehicle’s airbags had deployed on impact. The biker died despite wearing a helmet.

Senior police officials too said that the vehicular speed was the primary killer.

Nashik rural police superintendent Arti Singh said, “There are a lot of things that lead to road accidents during the night hours . Though there are fewer vehicles on the road, the drivers are almost always overspeeding at night. Truck drivers transporting perishable items that need to be delivered on time also speed their vehicles. At the same time, many of them may also be tired and sleep-deprived. Those who doze off, meet with accidents.”

She said people should avoid night drives whenever possible. Illumination on the road is also important. Often, motorists are not able to make out the edge of the road. Hence, the installation of blinkers, cat’s eyes are important as well. The SP said they have also written to the National Highway Authority of India (NHAI) to put up blinkers and cat’s eyes on the road.

Police officials said that since the roads are relatively empty at night compared to the daytime, the speed of vehicles is on the higher side. When the motorists have to apply sudden brakes, they fail.

There have been many accidents of speeding motorists ramming their vehicles into standstill vehicles on the road. Motorists have also got injured or killed when the vehicle in front of them had slowed down.

Meanwhile, the other time slot that recorded a high number of casualties in the survey by the RTO is the period between 3 pm and 6 pm wherein 2,299 people died in 3,036 accidents.

In a brief chat with TOI he says that the method could bring good returns to farmers. He says other farmers should try this on their land.

Is growing exotic fruit varieties like jambus, soursop and figs possible in Madurai’s climate?

There is a concept called dry land horticulture, and Murugesan is an example that it can be done successfully. Almost all types of exotic fruits, including dragon fruit, and figs can be grown this way.

Isn’t irrigation important to horticultural crops?

If the farmers go for drip irrigation, which is subsidized by the central government, farmers can reap the benefits. Fruit trees can be grown this way even in the driest land.

What is unique about going for dry land horticulture?

These fruits are rich in minerals and full of nutrients and sell for a very good price and farmers can really benefit from it.

108,['11/03/2020'],Growing exotic fruits in Madurai no longer a mirage,"Madurai: Orchards aren’t something one expects to see in Madurai. But on the outskirts beyond Thirupalai, an experiment to change that is, literally, bearing fruit.

In an orchard, R Murugesan, a farmer, has been able to grow exotic fruits, many of them unknown to Madurai’s landscape. The achievement is a result of a few years of experimentation and hard work.

Murugesan says that he took it as a challenge to grow fruit-bearing trees in his 10 acre land, when many told him that the land is good for paddy only. “I decided to plant exotic fruit varieties, such as jambu or wax apple, figs, soursop, star fruit and oranges, which were not known to be grown in Madurai soil. My friends from Bangalore helped me get the saplings,’’ he said.

The jambu trees that he planted two years ago have grown well and are laden with fruit and the branches are breaking due to the weight. He has covered the two big trees with nets to ward off parrots and other birds.

Other trees such as soursop, orange and star fruit have also started bearing fruit. Murugesan says that his orchard is proof that nothing is impossible. Now, he plans to expand his orchard by planting around 40 more saplings of jambu, soursop, fig and gooseberry.

He ensures that he does not use chemical fertilizers for his plants, though people suggest him of using enhancers to quicken the growth. He uses manure of his goats and native cattle for his orchard and drip irrigation ensures that the plants get all the water they needed.

Apart from this he has a couple of jackfruit trees, banana groves, guava and mangoes. Many of the exotic fruits such as jambus sell for not less than Rs 120 per kg and there are many residents in Madurai city who make advance bookings for their share, when the harvest begins. “Farm fresh fruits are rare in Madurai, and we look forward to our share whenever Murugesan says he will pick the fruit,” said S Saraswathi of Anna Nagar.

Madurai district collector T G Vinay visited his orchard. Murugesan received a certificate of appreciation for his efforts from the collector on the Republic Day, which he says was a great source of encouragement.

111,['11/03/2020'],Nashik: Vipassana cancels its camps for March,"Representative image

NASHIK: The well-known Dhamma Giri – Vipassana International Academy at Igatpuri has cancelled all three camps this month due to the Covid-19 scare. Over 2,000 participants, including many foreigners, were registered to attend the session.

The institute has sent emails and messages to all the participants saying that the residential camps were being cancelled for indefinite time as they have been instructed to avoid large gatherings.

Madhu Savla, head teacher of the Vipassana centre, said “We had a discussion with district collector Suraj Mandhare on Monday, who instructed us to cancel the gatherings in wake of the outbreak of Covid-19 across the globe. We have intimated all the participants via emails and messages that the camps stand cancelled until further instructions.”

The first monthly short camp of 10 days, which was to begin on Wednesday had 600 male and 400 female registrations. Such camps take place every month, which have about 10% foreign participants to take part in the meditation activities. The other short camp was to begin from March 25 with 700 male and 400 female registrations.

“As many as 150 participants had registered for the long camp of 30 to 45 days. Among the participants were 70 foreign participants. The camp was to commence on March 25,” a volunteer told TOI.

Every camp also involves nearly 20 volunteers (dhamma sevaks) to help in smooth functioning of the self-introspective activities for the whole day.

The entire practice of Vipassana is based on mental training. The participants practice meditation by keeping silent for the whole day and are asked to abstain from any contact from their family and friends.

The beginners take up the short 10-day camps. Those who want to go for the longer camps of 30 days have to complete several short camps whereas to participate in the 45 days camps, completion of two 30 days camps is mandatory.

113,['11/03/2020'],PIL seeks greater accountability from social media firms over hate speech,"BENGALURU: In light of last month’s riots in Delhi in which over 50 people lost their lives, former Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) ideologue K N Govindacharya has filed a public interest litigation (PIL) in Delhi high court seeking a direction from the court to ask social media platforms to disclose details of their designated officers so that the public can flag hate speech and fake news/videos and these can be taken down in time. The court has listed the matter for a hearing, likely to be this week.

The PIL, reviewed by TOI, also seeks a direction from the court for social media platforms to take ‘immediate’ action on such content during events like Delhi riots, in which the latest death toll is 53, besides property damages. This comes in the wake of reports that the home ministry pulled up online platforms earlier this month for not taking down objectionable content fast enough during Delhi violence and warning them of legal action.

The designated officers of the social media firms mentioned here are different from a grievance officer, one of the lawyers involved in the PIL said.

“On many occasions, social media companies have censored or taken down the content, against which many users have grievances, but they are left with no remedy to approach appropriate authority. Similarly, there is hateful content that is not taken down, which in turn causes more crimes and leaves everyone hapless,” the PIL said by adding that such objectionable content is a big source of revenue for social media companies. Govindacharya has made the home ministry, IT ministry, and finance ministry a part of the PIL.

A Twitter India spokesperson declined to comment on the matter while Facebook India did not respond to TOI’s query. Without commenting directly, a YouTube India spokesperson said, “Over the last year, we’ve worked to better surface credible news sources on YouTube. We’ve changed our search and discovery algorithms to surface credible content, built new features that clearly label and prominently surface news sources on our homepage and search pages, and introduced information panels to help give users more sources where they can fact check information for themselves.”

114,['11/03/2020'],"Harvest of summer onion begins, crop arrives at Lasalgaon","Representative image

NASHIK: Farmers have started harvesting the fresh summer onions and the kitchen staple is trickling into the Lasalgaon APMC, the country’s largest wholesale onion market. Around 600-800 quintals of fresh summer onions were auctioned on Tuesday at the market. At the same time, around 15,000 quintals of late kharif crop also arrived at the market.

While the shelf life of kharif and late kharif onions is less than a month, the shelf life of summer onions is over six months. Hence, farmers prefer storing summer onions with an eye on better price. Farmers sell summer onions as per their requirement of money.

APMC officials said there is a little price difference between summer and kharif onions. Summer onions are costlier by Rs 500 per quintal than kharif onions. Unseasonal rains had damaged kharif onions and continuous rains had also delayed the plantation of late kharif onions.

This also delayed plantation of summer onions. Every year, plantation of summer onions take place by December end, but it continued by mid-Feb, said APMC officials.

“Usually, the harvest of summer onions begins from the first week of March. But this year, the harvest has delayed due to late plantation. It will take around two-three weeks for the supply of summer onions to normalise,” said APMC officials.

The average wholesale onion prices were recorded at Rs 1,800 per quintal on Monday at Lasalgaon APMC, against Rs 1,930 per quintal on Friday. The minimum and maximum wholesale onion prices were recorded at Rs 1,000 and Rs 1,921 per quintal, respectively, on Monday.

The average wholesale onion prices have dropped by almost 80% in past three months, from Rs 8,625 per quintal on December 16 to Rs 1,800 per quintal so far due to rise in supply as compared to demand.

APMC officials said the rise in supply as compared to demand has led to drop in average wholesale onion prices. The average wholesale onion prices may stabilise after the onion export begins.

On March 2, the union commerce ministry issued a notification regarding lifting of ban on onion export from March 15. According to APMC officials, the average wholesale onion prices may increase marginally by Rs 200 per quintal after March 15.

NASHIK: A painting exhibition has been organised by four city-based artists in the memory of renowned poet Kusumagraj at Kusumagraj Pratishthan, which will conclude on Wednesday.

The artists have put on display 35 items of paintings and sculptures including six metal sculptures in the exhibition. “We have been exhibiting our paintings in front of the city art lovers for 20 years. This is yet another opportunity for us to display our new endeavours. My paintings are on acrylic and I have experimented from nature to abstract in my landscapes,” said Atul Bhalerao, one of the painters.

The painters will be taking the exhibition at Jehangir Art Gallery in Mumbai at the end of this month. The four artists are teachers in different schools and colleges in the city who have displayed their works in various countries like the UAE and Lebanon. “Within six months, our next stop is Spain,” added Bhalerao.

Over 1000 people have admired the paintings and sculptures at the exhibition in the past 10 days which kick-started on March 1. They have exclaimed that the exhibits are different from others. “I have used a mixed medium in my oil paintings. The theme that I have used is mythological iconography revolving around Lord Vishnu,” said Bharti Hingne, another painter.

Santosh Masal, the third painter in the group, has used roller in his paintings to give a different texture. All the paintings identify and interpret nature in different ways.

Sujitkumar Mukhopadhyay, who is a central government officer in the Currency Note Press, brought his sculptures into the exhibition. “My pieces of art are made up of brass, bronze or wood. They represent nature from my view. As a piece of the mother tree depicts that it gives life to all and deforestation causes harm to it,” said Mukhopadhyay.

120,['11/03/2020'],T liabilities rise to touch Rs 2 lakh cr,"Hyderabad: Though government debt is well within the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management (FRBM) limits, its liabilities have mounted to about Rs 2 lakh crore — up by Rs 23,934 crore from the last financial year of 2018-19. Sources said the government owes Rs 10,000 crore bills to irrigation and roads and buildings (R&B) contractors alone.

The liabilities include open market borrowings, loans from the Centre, borrowings from financial institutions and banks and special securities issued by the National Small Savings Fund.

In the fiscal policy submitted to the assembly during the budget presentation recently, it was said the government’s liabilities for 2019-20 stood at Rs 1,99,215 crore, which was Rs 1,75,281 crore in 2018-19. Experts said this was a direct liability on the government since it had taken loans and financial aid from various institutions for implementing schemes and clearing pending bills to the contractors.

“A major portion of the liabilities are market borrowings which rose from Rs 1.33 lakh crore to Rs 1.58 lakh crore. Borrowings from the financial institutions and banks reduced from Rs 14,254 crore to Rs 13,797 crore from the last financial year,” the financial statement said. Senior finance officials said that of the total liabilities, about Rs 80,000 crore was accrued from undivided Andhra Pradesh.

Various corporations, special purpose vehicles (SPVs) such as Kaleshwaram Lift Irrigation Corporation, Mission Bhagiratha Corporation, Hyderabad Road Development Corporation Ltd and other agencies, which were set up by the government, availed loans totalling Rs 40,000 crore in the last five years for which the government stood as a guarantor.

As far as outstanding guarantees were concerned, the government gave Rs 7,000 crore guarantee in the current financial year. The guaranteed amount was Rs 40,241 crore, which saw a jump from Rs 33,739 crore in 2018-19.

“Of the government’s guaranteed loans and assistance, Rs 38,800 crore of Rs 40,241 crore fall in the medium risk category. The agencies and corporations, which had borrowed the money, may not be in a position to repay going by the current financial position. GHMC also falls in this category,” a senior official explained.

The Centre had increased FRBM limit of Telangana to 3.5% of GSDP from 3% in 2017. “Though the government is raising borrowings from the market with loan terms extending to 40 years, the borrowings limit of FRBM was 3%, which is lower than what the Centre has set,” a senior official said. “Telangana’s debt is well within FRBM limits and fiscally prudent,” he added.

They have also urged local MLA Pravin Zantye to make efforts to get tourist buses to the Mayem lake so that business can flourish once more like it did in the past.

“Presently, we are facing an acute financial crunch as mining activities have also been stopped. Under such circumstances, it would have been good if the shops were allotted without further delay,” Vaman Nagvekar, a local from Mayem, said.

Zantye told TOI that everything is in place for allotment of stalls and that only lifting of the election code of conduct is awaited. “Once the code is lifted, shops will be allotted,” he said.

The code of conduct has been enforced for the upcoming zilla panchayat polls and will be lifted on March 23.

With regard to the issue of tourist buses, Zantye said the tourism department has identified four spots — Saptakoteshwar temple in Narvem, Arvalem waterfall, Mayem lake, and Salim Ali bird sanctuary in Chorao.

“Once these are finalised, then tourist buses will start coming to Mayem lake again,” he told TOI, adding that there is ample parking space.

A villager, Deepak Kinalkar, said that the busloads of tourists that would come to the lake in the past helped boost business and that when they stopped their income was severely affected.

“We therefore demand that the government take the initiative to restart tourist buses to Mayem village,” Kinalkar said.

To facilitate tourism and avoid traffic congestion, Zantye said that the road from the lake to Chorao has been taken up for widening.

Three years ago, former Mayem legislator Anant Shet had undertaken beautification and extension of the lake through the tourism department. The work was recently completed.

In the newly extended area, locals were allotted 26 shops to the left of the lake.

The drive was launched on March 1 under the Maharashtra Nagri Swachh Abhiyan and will last for two months.

“The state government has asked all civic bodies to observe cleanliness campaigns in their jurisdiction in view of the 60th foundation day of Maharashtra on May 1. The campaign will be implemented between March 1 and April 30. The state government has already issued a government resolution (GR) in this connection,” a civic official said.

“According to the directives of the state government, participation of the citizens is a must in the civic cleanliness drive,” an NMC official said.

Solid waste management, road improvement and beautification, streetlight repairs and improvement, traffic islands and beautification of road dividers, beautification of city flyovers and gardens, removal of illegal hoardings, implementation of hawking policy, cleaning of city nullahs, regular cleanliness, participation of people and availability of funds are the key components of the civic cleanliness drive.

“We have started taking action against erring citizens responsible for non-segregation of waste, dumping construction waste on open space, dumping of garbage in the open, in order to make the city clean,” said NMC officials.

The civic body slapped a fine of Rs 26,300 on 32 citizens for throwing garbage in public places. “18 have been fined Rs 7,000 for non-segregation of waste, while 17 were slapped fine of Rs 18,500 for dumping construction waste in open spaces,” the official said.

He said the SEC should have directed the officials to remove these colours and hoardings and put covers on statues by the time the election notification was issued and election code came into effect on March 7.

He said the government wasted Rs 1,500 crore for painting panchayat offices in YSRC colours and an equal amount would be required now to remove those. He raised objection to municipal administration commissioner Vijay Kumar sitting with SEC N Ramesh Kumar in the press conference.

Naidu condemned the attack on TDP nominee at Pinnelli in Machavaram mandal of Gurazala assembly segment in Guntur district.

124,['11/03/2020'],Tamil Nadu: Untreated sewage ravages Buckingham Canal on Old Mahabalipuram Road,"A truck dumping sewage in the backwaters of Buckhingam Canal in Kalipattur

CHENNAI: The backwaters of the Buckingham Canal in Kalipattur on Rajiv Gandhi Expressway ( Old Mahabalipuram Road ) are being polluted by untreated sewage being released by lorries and officials concerned are doing little about it, say residents.

The solid waste that is dumped on the banks and burned by miscreants is compounding the problem, they say.

R Meera, who lives in an apartment complex in the area, said the stench from the untreated sewage and fumes from the burning garbage was unbearable. “We approached the local panchayat to highlight the issue as it was posing a huge health hazard, especially at a time when everyone is in a panic over Covid-19,” she said. While senior panchayat officials did not react, staff in the office had told them that the dumping was being moved to Maraimalai Nagar and the foul smell would dissipate in a few days, she added.

A senior public works department official said they had received a similar complaint from people in Navalur and that they had written to the panchayat there to look into the issue. Now, following complaints on the release of untreated sewage into the water body, an assistant engineer will be sent to the spot to check if the complaints are true. The department will then lodge a complaint with police, he said.

When contacted, J Venkat, an official of the Muttukadu panchayat, under whose jurisdiction Kalipattur village comes, said they regularly receive complaints about untreated raw sewage being let out into the water body. Even in February, they had caught a truck red handed, when it was releasing sewage into the water body, he said. The vehicle owner was made to pay a penalty to the panchayat as well as the taluk office.

Asked about the dumping and burning of unsegregated waste on the banks of the water body, Venkat said the panchayat had obtained permission to relocate the waste to a waste disposal unit near Singaperumalkoil. The work will begin on Wednesday and residents will soon be free of the problem of stench, he added.

125,['11/03/2020'],"Quepem bizmen protest steep hike in sanitation fee, trade licence tax","Quepem: The Quepem Municipal Council’s (QMC) decision to hike the sanitation fee by nearly 600%, garbage collection fee by over 200% and double the trade licence tax has not gone down too well with shopkeepers in the town. They allege that the hikes are very steep.

Incidentally, recent protests led to the civic body keeping in abeyance a proposal to hike property tax.

The sanitation fee, which was Rs 1 per day, has been hiked to Rs 6. Meanwhile, the door-to-door garbage collection fee, which was doubled in 2018 from Rs 360 to Rs 720, has been increased again, this time by over 200%.

“This year, when I went to pay the fee, the QMC official told me it is Rs 2,270,” bakery owner Felix Pinto said.

And in almost a double blow to the shopkeepers, the trade licence tax for 2020 has been doubled, too.

“Unable to pay both, the sanitation fee and trade tax at one go, I paid QMC half the amount. A few days later, I received a notice asking for the rest of the amount to be paid, along with 50% interest. My garbage bin does not overflow even after eight days,” one shopkeeper, Santosh Samant, said.

Another shop owner, Francisco D’Costa, has forked out Rs 2,695 as sanitation fee. “It is difficult to pay such a huge amount as sanitation fee and then the trade licence fee too, particularly since the business is not hugely profitable,” he said.

Quepem Shopkeepers Association president, John Fernandes recently wrote to QMC chairperson Dayesh Naik requesting that a meeting be convened among the council, the shopkeepers and locals MLA Chandrakant Kavlekar. In the letter he said the council had arbitrarily and unreasonably increased different taxes, which the shopkeepers are liable to pay.

Accordingly, a meeting was held on February 25 wherein shopkeepers put forth their complaints about difficulties they have been facing in paying the increased amounts and demanded that they be lowered. The meeting, however, was inconclusive.

Justifying the fee hikes, Naik told TOI that the civic body had not increased the trade tax for many years, as a result of which shopkeepers were paying a nominal fee.

Fernandes said, “Fee hikes should be proportionate. They cannot be increased so steeply at one shot. Also, some shopkeepers do not generate much garbage and this is an injustice to them. If the council is short of funds, it should reassess house tax. Many people have constructed bungalows and buildings on single room houses, but are paying a nominal house tax.”

126,['11/03/2020'],HC rejects plea to change zoning of ‘private forest’,"Panaji: The high court of Bombay at Goa has rejected the petition of a businessman from Mapusa who claimed he had been deprived of his fundamental right to practice business as he was being denied a no-objection certificate (NOC) for conversion of a property.

“If the petitioner is permitted to convert the property to any other use, it will be virtually impossible to remedy the irreversible situation. The approach of the deputy conservator of forests in declining the NOC at this stage was quite right and warrants no interference,” the division bench comprising justices Mahesh Sonak and M S Jawalkar said.

The court also stated that the issue of whether the property concerned was private forest or not could not be decided hurriedly and haphazardly. “Such an exercise has to be taken up in a holistic manner,” it said.

The businessman had challenged the November 29, 2019 communication by the deputy conservator of forests, North Goa division, Ponda, which stated that the matter of demarcation of private forests was sub judice before the National Green Tribunal (NGT).

The forest department has stated that the area in question was reflected as private forest in the Karapur Committee report and hence his application for NOC for conversion of the property could be considered.

Shivan Desai, the businessman’s counsel, stated that the exercise of demarcation and review had already been carried out and has been going on for the past 20 years. Stating that the land has not been classified as private forest, he sought that the impugned communication be set aside. The court, however, stated that the NGT has been monitoring the situation and held that the forest department was right in rejecting his application for NOC on the ground that the matter is pending before the NGT.

VISAKHAPATNAM: Hundreds of Telugu students from AP and Telangana are stranded in Italy as the Mediterranean country went into lockdown to tackle the sudden surge in Covid-19 cases. The students are in places such as Padova, Rimini, Modena, Milan — all declared red zones for the virus. With Italy registering 97 deaths on March 9, more government restrictions, especially in travelling, have been placed from Tuesday.

The students are a worried lot given the shortage of masks and restricted entry at supermarkets. From Tuesday, everyone has been told to confine themselves at home while shutting down all public places.

Telugu students that TOI spoke to said hospitals were reluctant to give ‘fit’ certificates and there was no provision to check those without symptoms, making it difficult for them to return. Sources added that Indian embassy authorities too are insisting on fit certificates to be considered for evacuation.

Badarinath Gella from Kodad in Suryapet district of Telangana has just completed his engineering degree from one of world’s oldest institutions in Italy – the 931-year-old University of Bologna. He told TOI from Italy: “Over 30 of us are still stranded in Bologna. I am worried. It is very difficult and time consuming to get medical fitness certificate here, especially because we do not have symptoms.”

Nearly 50 Indian students are studying at the University of Padova, which is again a red zone, while five Telugu students, mostly from Vijayawada, are stranded at Moderna. Leela Krishna Chowdary from Anantapur, studying agriculture in Padova said, “As Padova got quarantined we cannot come back to India. We are not even allowed to move to other cities.”

A Sree Charan Teja from Hyderabad, a final year aeronautical engineering student at Milan, had to remain back as he had a renewal date for a stay permit. “When Codogno was quarantined, there were no stores open, including grocery stores,” he said. “It will be bad if the situation is similar in Milan. There are around 100 Telugu students there. The rules don’t allow more than 10 people at a time in supermarkets.”

He added: “When it comes to health check-ups, we need to call 1500 if we have symptoms. But as per my knowledge there are no health camps where we can volunteer for a virus check-up. As per current national restrictions, all institutes and places of public interest, sports and wellness centres are closed till April 3,” he said.

Prasanth Chasdiel, hailing from Mantada village in Krishna district of AP, who is studying for MSc in tourism economics and management from Rimini campus of the University of Bologna, said: “Rimini has been quarantined along with 11 other provinces. During the outbreak, the flight prices were hiked. We cannot move out and we also need a fitness certificate to come to India. Everyone is worried at home.”

130,['11/03/2020'],TDP to field Ramaiah for RS polls,"Amaravati: TDP president N Chandrababu Naidu has decided to field a candidate in the Rajya Sabha elections.

With only 23 MLAs, TDP has no numbers to win any seat. TDP’s decision to field the candidate will only prompt the authorities to conduct the polling.

Earlier, the officials thought that it could be a unanimous one as YSRC has the strength to win all the four seats from the state.

Speaking to the media here on Tuesday, Naidu said that they have decided to field senior leader Varla Ramaiah to uphold the democratic process. He, however, appealed to YSRC legislators to support Ramaiah keeping in view of the CM’s undemocratic attitude and anti-people rule.

Naidu said TDP would issue whip to all the party legislators. He said that TDP legislators have to cast their vote by showing it to the party election agent. “We will take action against those violated the whip under anti-defection laws,” warned Naidu.

Sources said Naidu has decided to field a candidate in the RS elections only to make defectors fall in line. Gannavaram MLA Vallabhaneni Vamsi and Guntur West MLA Maddali Giridhar have been hobnobbing with YSRC without quitting as MLAs. They were working for the victory of YSRC candidates in the local body elections without formally joining the party.

132,['11/03/2020'],Maharashtra Tourism Development Corporation starts trial of boats to be used at boat club,"Representative image

NASHIK: The Maharashtra Tourism Development Corporation ( MTDC ) has started trial run of boats that would be used by the boat club at Gangapur dam on the outskirts of the city.

An MTDC official said that the trails are being carried out to ensure that the boats are in proper shape. “The boat club will become functional by April-end and initially 11 boats would be deployed for the tourists,” he said.

This project was the brainchild of district guardian minister Chhagan Bhujbal and was planned in the year 2014. However, the former BJP-led state government put the project on backburner.

After the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA)-led state government came to power, Bhujbal again started focusing on projects started by him like the boat club.

Bhujbal had recently visited the boat club at Gangapur dam to review the status and directed the officials concerned to carry out the repair work and speed up the project.

“The boats were procured five years ago and needed some repair works. We have a total of 40 boats and have repaired around five of them. We are conducting trials of the boats that are to be deployed for boating in Gangapur dam. We have permission to operate only 11 boats. We will soon seek water resources department’s approval for more boats,” the official said.

“Earlier, we had plans to deploy a private agency to operate the boat club. But we have now changed our plan. We will start the boat club on our own and will take a call on deploying private agency after few months,” the official said.

The MTDC had procured as many as 45 boats for the boat club project, but 10 of these boats were taken to Sarankheda by former state tourism minister Jay Kumar Rawal in last two years. Later, five boats were returned to the boat club.

The district guardian minister has already made it clear that he would not bring those five boats from Sarankheda and he has donated those boats to Rawal.

The foreigner, who had come to India on a student visa, was held for his involvement in a prostitution racket involving women from Turkmenistan and Kyrgyzstan, and was booked under the Immoral Traffic Prevention Act.

“He crossed the borders and indulged in such activities despite having come to this country on a student visa and otherwise overstayed his visit, for which he is charged accordingly, and apparently has to face trial before the Judicial Magistrate First Class,” justice Nutan Sardessai said. “Looking at the seriousness of the offence of trafficking, the applicant would not be entitled to the benefit of bail.”

The court said that upon perusing the statements of the survivors that were put on record, it was apparent that the man had a role to play in pushing the women into prostitution and collecting money from them as commission. It also said that the accused’s role was required to unearth the process by which he procured the women and used them for prostitution in Goa.

“The possibility of the applicant fleeing from justice also cannot be ruled out as remote,” the court added.

135,['11/03/2020'],Chennai: Central metro yet to fully integrate with MGR Central railway station,"The area given to Chennai Metro Rail Limited (CMRL) has been paved with interlocked tiles

CHENNAI: It’s been two years since Central metro rail station was opened, but there is no seamless connectivity or a walking path for commuters to access MGR Central railway station .

Alternative arrangements to integrate Central metro to MGR Central are yet to take shape after Southern Railway didn’t allow metro to build a subway connecting the metro station with the railway station.

All entry/exits of the station, which connect two metro lines, have been opened and the area given to Chennai Metro Rail Limited (CMRL) has been paved with interlocked tiles. But commuters who take the metro train to reach MGR Central struggle to reach the main railway station to board express trains since there is no dedicated pathway from metro entry or exit points to the railway station.

The uneven tiles are a hassle for the passengers because they find it difficult to roll their trolley bags. Besides, cars, cabs and two-wheelers that drive by the front of the railway station towards the parking area and the Moore Market Complex suburban station come in the way of people who walking from MGR Central to the metro station and vice versa.

“I find it difficult to reach the station with the heavy bags. Most of the people come up through escalators and lifts but have to walk a long way. The long walk is not an issue if there is a smooth pathway that is easier to move luggage,” said Arun Kumar, a passenger headed to Central.

The MGR Central station campus is chaotic in the evening when there are several departures of express trains. Since metro lines connect key areas of the city like Parry’s, Anna Nagar, Egmore, Koyambedu, CMBT, airport and others people proceeding to board trains at Central prefer to use the metro to beat the evening rush hour traffic. Central metro is the second busiest station with around 9,000 commuters using it daily.

In contrast, CMRL and Airports Authority of India have installed good connectivity between airport metro station and the airport using a tube and a walkalator. T K Pandian, a regular commuter, said, “They have built a good facility for commuters to access the airport. Similar planning doesn’t seem to have been done for connecting MGR Central and Central metro.”

A canopy has been installed near the Moore Market complex entrance of the railway station for commuters to reach the suburban and the railway stations.

A railway official said there will be more amenities for passengers when CMRL completes its Central Square project. A new pathway between Central metro and Moore Market Complex will also be set up as part of the Central Square project which is underway.

136,['11/03/2020'],"TDP suffers jolt as Satish Reddy, Kadiri quit party","AMARAVATI: In what could be big a jolt to TDP , Pulivendula strongman and former legislative council deputy chairman SV Satish Reddy quit the party.

He said he has lost hope in the TDP leadership. He said he failed to get due recognition despite working for the party with commitment. Sources said Satish Reddy is all set to join YSRC.

Satish Reddy had lost assembly elections against YS Rajasekhara Reddy, YS Vijayamma and YS Jaganmohan Reddy in Pulivendula since 2004.

In another shocker to TDP, former MLA and close friend of Nandamuri Balakrishna, Kadiri Babu Rao joined YSRC in the presence of YSRC president and chief minister YS Jaganmohan Reddy at the latter’s camp office here on Tuesday. Baburao had represented Kanigiri assembly constituency in Prakasam district between 2014-19.

Speaking to the media after joining YSRC, Baburao said he quit TDP after realizing that they could not work under Chandrababu Naidu’s leadership anymore. “I have been working for TDP for the last 34 years and joined YSRC along with my cadre as we can’t work along with Naidu” said Baburao.

He said that people have faith in Jagan’s rule as he had been working for the uplift of all sections in society. “I respect Nandmuri Balakrishna. I believe that my friend Balakrishna was also being deceived by Naidu. I hope he will also realize this soon,” said Baburao.

Kapu leader Thota Trimurthulu, who accompanied Baburao, said Baburao had decided to snap his three decades of bond with TDP as they could not continue with a leader who would not stand by his words. He said Jagan had fulfilled 90% of the promises in nine months.

Baburao lost his first election to the Congress-backed independent candidate Buchepalli Subbareddy in Darsi assembly constituency in 2004. He shifted to Kanigiri in 2009 but his nomination was rejected by the returning officer during the scrutiny of papers for failing to sign an affidavit. After two unsuccessful attempts, Baburao won in 2014 on a TDP ticket. However, TDP shifted him to Darsi in 2019, leading to another defeat.

VIJAYAWADA: The high court on Tuesday issued notices to the state government while hearing petitions challenging the government’s decision to evict people from the assigned lands and in some petitions directed the government to maintain status quo.

Beneficiaries of assigned lands from all districts moved the high court challenging the government move to take the lands back for various reasons.

More than 200 petitions are in the high court. Many contended the acquisition of various lands that includes assigned lands, village poramboku lands and other lands to allot house sites to the landless poor. As part of the exercise to provide house sites to all under Navaratnalu scheme, the government has started land acquisition in all districts.

The decision to acquire assigned lands sparked a controversy as many of the beneficiaries of the assigned lands are the landless poor and are in possession of the said lands by way of cultivation or by other means. They have moved the HC challenging the decision to evict them from the land assigned to them by the government. tnn

The civic body has appointed 32 returning officers for 64 wards in the city to implement the model code of conduct.

A special training programme for the returning officers was held in the city on Tuesday in which district collector and VMC special officer A Mohammed Imtiaz and VMC commissioner Prasanna Venkatesh trained the officials. Imtiaz asked officials to follow the MCC and elections rules as well the instructions in the returning officer’s handbook and MCC.

“Returning officers and assistant returning officers play an important role in municipal elections. You should act as moderators and act impartially. Voters’ lists and details of polling stations should be made available at the returning officers’ offices by Wednesday morning,” he said.

VMC commissioner Prasanna Venkatesh directed returning officers to be careful in election duties. “Officials should focus on their responsibilities. Accepting nominations, verifying the documents, final scrutiny and withdrawal of nominations should be done properly,” Venkatesh said. Symbols should be allocated to the candidates by following the rules under the election code, he said.

On the other hand, political parties have been busy finalising the candidates. Jana Sena and Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) conducted a series of meetings on Tuesday to finalise the candidates. BJP has turned its focus on key areas like Old City and Satyanarayanapuram. A few YSRC and independent candidates are likely to file nominations on Wednesday.

NASHIK: Defence minister Rajnath Singh has directed the Local Military Authority ( LMA ) in Nashik to provide proper access to the residents of a village in the Deolali Cantonment area to the cremation ground.

The cremation ground is located adjacent to the field range at Deolali and the residents of Shigwe Bahulla village (of Ward VII) have been facing problems getting access to the cremation ground. The village has a population of over 8,000. The military had acquired the land adjacent to the cremation ground for its use.

Nashik Lok Sabha member Hemant Godse had been pursuing the matter with the defence ministry since February 2018. Godse had written three letters to Singh drawing his attention to the problems being faced by the villagers in carrying bodies to the cremation ground for the final rites.

Singh wrote back to Godse on the March 4, informing him about the instructions given to LMA Nashik after examining the issue. “I have directed the LMA to provide a flat strip of land for free access to the residents of the village to the cremation ground. Residents who need access to the cremation ground should not be inconvenienced,” Singh wrote in his letter.

According to the Union minister, a meeting was held recently involving representatives of the Cantonment Board, Deolali, to finalise the alignment of the road.

Godse told TOI that residents of Shigwe Bahulla were having trouble accessing the cremation ground as there was no proper road. “After the new road comes up, bodies and the wood to light pyres can be taken either by vehicles or on shoulders to the cremation ground,” he added.

CBD vice-president Bhagwan Katariya said Singh’s decision has come as a huge relief for the villagers. “The villagers were not keen on shifting the crematorium ground as they had sentiments attached to where their elders were cremated,” added Katariya. CBD’s chief executive officer Ajay Kumar also welcomed the MoD decision. “We will construct the road as soon as we receive the directive from the ministry,” he said.

CPI state secretary K Ramakrishna and Vijayawada MP Kesineni Srinivas (Nani) organised a joint meeting in Kesineni Bhavan on Tuesday and deliberated on seat-sharing. Representatives from both parties said they have tied up to fight against the anti-people policies of YSRC government.

“Jagan’s government is working against the will of the public. He is trying to damage both Krishna and Guntur districts by shifting the capital. We will bring the failures of YS Jaganmohan Reddy and his government to the notice of the public and seek their support in the local body polls,” Kesineni said.

“The TDP government had created a large land bank in the capital region with around 35,000 acres and YSRC is trying to misuse it. The TDP will not let it happen,” he added.

Both parties hope that they will win around 75% of the seats in Vijayawada Municipal Corporation (VMC). A list of candidates is likely to be released on the morning of March 12 with the approval of TDP supremo N Chandrababu Naidu.

WARANGAL: An assistant labour officer (ALO), who allegedly paid Rs 1 crore for his transfer to a former local TRS worker of Warangal , was murdered and his body dumped deep inside a forested area. The ALO, Anand Reddy, had gone missing on March 7. The ex-TRS functionary, identified as Pradeep Reddy, has been arrested.

Cops said it was about four months ago that the ALO requested Pradeep to help him get a transfer from Khammam to Warangal.

“Pradeep promised him a transfer using his influence and asked him to pay Rs 1 crore in instalments. He also promised the ALO a share in his sand mining business. As planned, the entire money was paid to him over a period,” said a senior Warangal police officer probing the case.

When his transfer did not materialise, Anand started asking Pradeep to return his money. “But after the recent local body polls, the party expelled Pradeep due to alleged negative propaganda during elections and he no longer held any influence in the party,” the officer said.

As the ALO continued to pester him for money, Pradeep planned to murder him. He convinced the ALO to take land instead of money, claiming that he has large tracts of land in Bhupalapally. According to the plan, Pradeep called Anand to Warangal and then took him to Bhupalapally on the pretext of showing the land and killed him, police said.

“After committing the murder, Pradeep dumped the body in Gollabuddaram forest area,” said commissioner of police V Ravinder.

Based on a complaint by the ALO’s brother-in-law Indrasena Reddy, police picked up Pradeep Reddy and questioned him. “During interrogation, he confessed to killing the ALO. His body was found in the Gollabuddaram forest. We are investigating the case further,” Ravinder said.

CHENNAI: Holding that mere delay in conducting trial in cases under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act does not take away the bar on granting bail to suspects, the Madras high court dismissed a bail application moved by an accused arrested by the National Investigation Agency (NIA) in connection with a murder case.

A division bench of Justice R Subbiah and Justice R Pongiappan, rejecting the submissions of S Nijam Ali alias Nijam that the trial in the criminal case will consume much time and therefore the accused languishing in jail for a considerable length of time must be enlarged on bail, said: “The nature of crime alleged to have been committed by the accused is such that the prosecution must be given adequate time to conduct the trial by examining several witnesses to prove the guilt of the accused. In this process, the trial may get protracted, however, it will not be a ground for this court to grant bail to the accused.”

The issue pertains to the murder of V Ramalingam, a PMK former functionary , in Thanjavur on February 5, 2019. It was claimed that the murder was committed by members of Popular Front of India (PFI) and its political organisation called Social Democratic Party of India (SDPI) as Ramalingam objected to their ‘religious work’.

Objecting to the bail, the prosecution submitted that it has filed a memo before the trial court for hiding the identity of 15 vital witnesses, who speak about the conspiracy and overt acts of the accused.

After due consideration, the trial court allowed the memo on merits.

“Therefore, we apprehend that the protected witnesses are also living in the very same locality of the accused and there is every possibility of threat to the life of those witnesses, especially when these witnesses have to come forward and identify the accused persons during trial,” the prosecution said.

Recording the submissions, the bench said: “The trial court is directed to examine the hide-out witnesses and record their evidence at the earliest, preferably on or before June 30. Further, on completion of examination of the hide-out witnesses, the accused persons are at liberty to approach the trial court again for grant of bail.”

And it took hardly a month to travel across the globe to Africa and the Americas.Tamil Nadu has reported one positive case and has more than 1,000 people in home quarantine. Tamil Nadu is one of the few states to have two testing labs for the virus and quarantine wards in hospitals across the state. Yet, the state has not put in place certain public health safeguards that some neighbouring states have adopted.Kerala, which reported eight new cases on Tuesday, is working on a war footing. It has suspended all school examinations up to Class V. The Sabarimala Temple Board has advised Ayyappa devotees not to visit the hill shrine for the monthly puja from March 14 to 18. Theatres have been closed till the month-end.For nearly three weeks now, Kerala airports have been screening both incoming domestic and international passengers. Karnataka government was the first to declare early holidays for primary schoolchildren. In both these states, inter-departmental collaboration is evident.Tamil Nadu, meanwhile is treating Covid-19 as an exclusive concern of the state health department, hospitals and doctors. Many departments in the state have either not taken this seriously enough, or have decided there is nothing they can do. As WHO director general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus put it, this isn’t a drill. “This is not the time to give up. This is not a time for excuses. This is a time for pulling out all the stops.”Tamil Nadu cannot sit pretty in the comfort that “only one case” has been reported. It cannot afford to be caught unawares. We are in the middle of a board examination season when 23 lakh students take annual tests. There are no hand sanitisers or liquid soap or awareness posters at exam centres. Except a circular on Monday, making biometric attendance optional in schools, the education department has been mostly silent.Every Friday, people throng theatres to watch new movies. The first IPL match this season in Chennai is slated for March 26, when some 37,000 are likely to jostle in the stadium. There has been no analysis of the risk. The ongoing Tamil month of Maasi is so auspicious, not a day goes without a temple festival or a family function. When asked, an official of the Hindu religious and charitable endowments (HR&CE) said there is no advisory to temples.Chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswami has convened meetings with officials, good. But that is not enough for a viral strain that has challenged the best medicare systems and protocols known to the world and infected more than 1 lakh people, killing nearly 4,000 of them so far.It is time to put together a multi-disciplinary swift response unit with public health professionals, doctors (and they are not the same), health workers and experts from all possible fields. Public awareness – as much to avoid contracting the virus as to behaving responsibly by volunteering to be in quarantine if needed – is the first shield against the contagion. It won’t be out of place to think of penalties to people who willfully break the quarantine protocol.We are not asking for panic. We are advocating preparedness, though sometimes it’s better to be scared than sorry.",chennai,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74574834,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-229062,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/its-better-to-be-scared-than-sorry/articleshow/74567876.cms

HYDERABAD: Unidentified persons broke in and murdered a 42-year-old woman and fled with her gold and silver jewellery in Nizamabad . They also severed two toes of the victim in their bid to steal the ornaments.

The offenders sprinkled vermilion, spices and pickles around the body and lit oil lamps around the body in what police termed as an attempt to divert the attention of investigators.

The deceased, R Varalakshmi, was the wife of Srinivas, construction businessman from Nizamabad’s Aryanagar. According to police, Srinivas left the house on Monday at around 11.30 am for work and the incident came to light after he returned home at around 8.30 pm.

“When Srinivas returned home, the main door was latched from outside. Srinivas opened the door and found his wife Varalakshmi dead on the sofa of the hall. The assailants had hit her on the head with a blunt object and slit her throat with a sharp-edged weapon,” Nizamabad Town Inspector Satyanarayana said. Shocked, Srinivas ran out of the house screaming for help after which neighbours started gathering around the house. The police were then informed about the incident.

“The assailants ransacked the house and escaped with five tola gold and some silver ornaments including the jewellery the victim wore,” the inspector said and added that the assailants had severed two of the victim’s toes to steal the silver toe rings.

“We suspect that sprinkling of various powders and lighting oil lamps has been done to divert the attention of investigators by making it look like an offence committed by someone indulging in occult practices. They also might have sprinkled the powders to make it difficult for sniffer dogs to follow the trail,” said a senior police official from Nizamabad.

The victim’s family has a German Shepherd dog at home which was there when the murdered had occurred. “The dog was tied outside the house but surprisingly neighbours did not hear any barking. We suspect that the accused could be someone known to the family,” said a police official. The victim’s family is from Andhra Pradesh’s Praksam district and her two children are studying in Guntur.

Police are analysing the CCTV footage and cellphone usage details around the crime scene around the time of the offence. “We are following all available leads to zero-in on the offenders,” Nizamabad commissioner Kartikeya said.

Courtesy: cutlery banks that cater to this side of town and helping residents reduce their carbon footprint. Events like the one in Sainikpuri are becoming more common, says Phani Bala Annadanam , whose cutlery was used at the event. Started about six months ago, Annadanam’s Sita cutlery bank is now packed with orders.

The former IT professional says she started renting out steel sets after she tried organising a zero-waste event for her child’s birthday, but found few people who could meet the requirements. “I now have 125 sets which include a plate, bowl, spoon and cups for water and tea,” she says, adding she caters to all kinds of events.

Nidarshana Saikia Das who started The Bartan Company, with a four-member all women team, also stresses on a growing market for reusables. Though located in Nallagandla , her company is often called to supplement stock for larger events in the Secunderabad area. “With number of orders rising, we are planning to open up a branch in the area,” said Das. This would cut cost required to move huge volumes of cutlery, she said.

For those who still prefer disposables, but want to go green, smaller groups such as the NGO ‘Special Friends’ located in Kapra provide leaf-based plates. “Our team comprises of young persons with disabilities and women. We provide training to them in using machines to make green cutlery and provide them employment,” said founder Swathi Kureti.

WARANGAL: A notorious inter-state robber, K Lalitha alias Padma, was arrested and 980 grams of gold ornaments worth Rs 44 lakh were recovered from her by Jangaon police on Tuesday.

Police said Lalitha, a resident of Vaikuntapuram of Kavali mandal in Nellore district, has robbed several dozens of woman passengers at bus stations across districts in Telangana and Andhra Pradesh.

After receiving information that she would be travelling from Jangaon with gold ornaments to sell them in the Hyderabad jewellery market, the Warangal Central Crime Station (CCS) alerted the Jangaon police. A special team was rushed to Jawahar Park in Jangaon, where woman constables took Lalitha into custody.

According to commissioner Dr V Ravinder , K Lalitha used to rob woman passengers to maintain her luxurious life. In 2007, she had stolen gold ornaments from bags of dozens of woman passengers in Kadapa, Guntur, Atmakur, Vijayawada, Eluru and Nalgonda bus stations. In 2018, Khammam police caught her red-handed while trying to rob a woman at the bus stand. She was produced in a court and sent to jail.

After being released from jail, she targeted woman passengers in Karimnagar and Warangal districts. So far, police have confirmed that she has been involved in 17 cases across Mahabubabad, Siddipet, Jangaon, Subedari and Intezargunj, Hanamkonda, Mills Colony, Geesukonda police station limits in Warangal and Devaruppula in Jangaon.

DCP Srinivas Reddy, Jangaon ACP Vinod Kumar, CCS inspector L Rameshkumar and police staff interrogated her and seized the gold ornaments.

153,['11/03/2020'],Cash-strapped Telangana govt puts unemployment dole on hold,"Telangana chief minister KCR

HYDERABAD: The much-touted payment of unemployment allowance of Rs 3,016 per month to jobless youth remains a non-starter. Highly-placed sources said the state government believes that the allowance can be extended only after the economic condition improves.

In its campaign for the December 2018 assembly elections, the ruling TRS in its manifesto had promised to sanction Rs 3,016 each to unemployed youngsters till they get a job. “No allocations have been made in the recent budget to provide the unemployment allowance to jobless youth,” Telangana Youth Congress spokesperson SP Kranthi Kumar said.

Kumar recalled that TRS had promised government jobs to the youth in 2014 elections. “After the youth voted for TRS, the government had not only failed to provide government jobs but also fill vacant posts,” he said. Enquiries have revealed that over 24.50 lakh people have registered themselves with the Telangana State Public Service Commission (TSPSC) as part of one-time reRs gistration facility. However, not all of them are jobless.

“Many of the 24.50 lakh registered with the TSPSC are working, having a job in either government or private sector. For example, a grade IV employee has registered so that he can take examination for posts in grade III and grade II. A large number of the registered people are private employees, aspiring for government jobs,” said an official.

Chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao gave enough indications while speaking in the legislative council on Saturday that his government has got almost four years to implement the promise made to the youth. The chief minister has also made it clear that TRS had never promised a job in every house which, he alleged, was a malicious campaign run by the opposition parties. KCR said he had promised to fill up one lakh vacancies in the government sector, which is being done.

Meanwhile, unemployed youth joint action committee chairman Manavta Roy told TOI that they would be launching an agitation if KCR fails to implement the allowance from retrospective effect from December 13, 2018. “Also, the government should fill up two lakh vacancies in government sector by coming out with a recruitment calendar,” he said.

HYDERABAD: Leaders cutting across party lines termed the arrest of Malkajgiri MP A Revanth Reddy as an act of political vendetta by TRS and demanded that the government withdraw the cases against him. CPI state secretary Chada Venkat Reddy and Telangana Jana Samithi president M Kodandaram condemned the arrest of Revanth and said TRS was crushing all democratic norms by unleashing police force against those raising voice of dissent against the government.

Congress leaders alleged that hundreds of supporters of Revanth were prevented from going to Cherlapalli prison where Revanth is lodged. They were planning to take out a rally in the hope that Revanth would get a bail on Tuesday which, however, did not happen. Police denied that they did not stop anyone nor took supporters of Revanth into custody.

Former Congress minister Mohammed Ali Shabbir said Revanth had been arrested for exposing corrupt deeds of municipal administration minister KT Rama Rao . “The state government should first clarify whether or not KTR constructed a farmhouse on 25 acres of land within the purview of GO 111. Whether the farmhouse is illegal or legal? Who approved it?” Shabbir sought to know.

“There are many other farmhouses and properties purchased by KCR family. The government should either order a probe by a House committee, judicial commission or CBI into these allegations,” Shabbir demanded.

CHENNAI: Intermittent rainfall coupled with cyclone Gaja and the Centre’s tweak, which has led to thousands of salt manufacturers going to court, has hit salt production in Tamil Nadu . The amount of salt produced by the state in the last three years has significantly come down leaving manufacturers with very little stock to sell during the off-season. Salt manufactured in the state is used for industrial purpose and is also refined and used as edible salt.

According to official sources from the office of the deputy commissioner of salt, the state manufactured 18 lakh tonnes in 2017-18, 16 lakh tonnes in 2018-19 and less than 14 lakh tonnes the following year. Manufacturers pointed out that TN is slowly losing its self-sufficiency in salt production.

During off season, which is between October and March, prices of industrial salt shot up drastically from Rs 800 a tonne to around Rs 1500 a tonne. “To compensate we are importing a large amount of salt from Gujarat,” said M Kandasaamy, a salt manufacturer based in Marakkanam. In the past one year, TN has imported 1,40,000 tonnes of salt from Gujarat, which manufacturers claim is the highest in all the years of salt production.

V Senthil, secretary of Vedaranyam small-scale salt manufacturers federation, blamed the government for not helping to revive the pans destroyed during cyclone Gaja in 2018. “After the tsunami, the state gave Rs 14,500 per acre to manufacturers to revive salt pans, but after the cyclone, at least 3,000 acres of salt pans are still buried under a foot of slush. We received no aid and are struggling to revive it,” he said, adding that many small-scale investors are also shutting shop. “They now see salt production as a loss-making avenue. Also, no new investors are coming forward,” he said.

In 2013, the Centre had stopped renewing leases of manufacturers. It said that it would instead issue fresh tenders. But the deputy commissioner’s office said that they are ‘prohibited’ from doing so, until further notice.

As much as 17,500 acres of salt pans in Tamil Nadu belong to the Centre and it employs more than 60,000 workers. Due to the order, more than 400 salt manufacturers went to court and obtained a stay against the order and at least 100 have shut shop.

“In Tuticorin, many manufacturers’ lease will expire next year and they are preparing to go to court. If the authorities don’t intervene, production will be signifiantly hit,” said P Dileep Prakash, director of Tuticorin Salt and Marine Chemicals Ltd.

“Manufacturers are losing interest. We don’t know what the government wants to do,” said Kandasamy. Marakkanam, which used to produce more than 1,00,000 tonnes of salt a year, produced less than 50,000 tonnes last year. The salt production in Vedaranyam and Tuticorin has come down from 6,08,000 tonnes in 2018 to 2,85,000 tonnes in 2019 and from 14 lakh tonnes in 2018 to around 10 lakh tonnes in 2019, respectively.

In a recent meeting, Ministry of Commerce and Industry (salt section) had proposed the transfer of management of salt-producing lands to the state government. “It is still in the pipeline, no confirmation has been made yet,” said a senior official from the Tamil Nadu Salt Corporation.

“When the petitioner comes out with the election petition to declare the election of the returned candidate void, he has to establish that improper receipt of votes or violation of the rules in counting of postal ballots and subsequent recounting, have materially affected the election of the returned candidate.

In the above circumstances, the election of Seethapathy cannot be set aside believing the oral testimonials of the election petitioner and his witnesses. Further, in the absence of any strong circumstances, the contentions of the election petitioner cannot be accepted to hold the election as void, the court added.

According to the petitioner, before counting of postal ballots, the DMK candidate’s son handed over a bulk of postal ballot papers to the returning officer which was objected to by the petitioner. However, without considering his objections, the returning officer received the ballots and started counting the postal ballot papers after mixing them with the already available ballots.

163,['11/03/2020'],Why Tangedco is on a downward spiral,"CHENNAI: It’s like pouring water into a leaking can. As the power utility is staring at one of its worst crisis, tumbling to operational losses from profits, conventional wisdom would suggest a cure by increasing power tariffs or lowering losses by pushing its own units to generate more power, a cheaper option. The third option is to privatise power distribution which will arrest leakages due to transmission and distribution losses. But the Tamil Nadu Generation and Distribution Corporation (Tangedco) is doing none of these.

A major concern is the cost of power rising to 45 paise in the first half of the financial year of 2019 from 33 paise in the previous year.

A first notice has been served on the government utility, with a downgrade in December by India Ratings, with an outlook lowered to ‘negative’.

Sample this: At the Thalaiyuthu factory of The India Cements, the power plant is generating at 82% plant load factor (PLF) — a percentage of energy sent out by the power plant corresponding to installed capacity. Just 60km away in Tuticorin, the state owned Tangedco’s unit is working at just 57% PLF. For comparison, the state-owned NTPC operates its plants at a PLF of 76.7%.

The consequential impact of lower margins, almost stagnant power sales and widening losses per unit have resulted in its interest coverage ratio — a measure to determine how easily a company can pay its interest expenses on outstanding debt — to a precarious 0.1% in financial year (FY) 2019 from 0.26% in FY2018. It was under just under 1 during FY14-FY18. In simple terms, without the state government’s blank cheque a default is inevitable.

""In view of the numbers, Ind-Ratings expects the liquidity profile to stay strained over the next one or two years. Tangedco’s total debt increased to Rs79,630 crore in FY18 from Rs65,897 crore in FY17,"" S Rajaraman, associate director, India Ratings wrote in a note.

As the government is hesitant to raise tariffs in the agrarian sector, agriculture consumer subsidy proportions 48% of the overall subsidy over FY15-FY18. ""Normally coal-based power plants can be operated at minimum 90% PLF without any issues, irrespective of the age of the facility. The only factor that can impact performance is poor coal quality. But all coal that is tendered for 6,000 GCV (gross calorific value), same as what private sector power plants buy. Yet if the PLF is so tragic, then there appears to be something more than meets the eye,"" a senior executive at an independent power producer told TOI, on condition of anonymity. The plant load factor for FY19 was at 68.7% while a year ago was 60.4%, a clear indication of the underlying malaise.

The math goes like this: The state has a thermal capacity of 4,320MW which means 10.36 crore units per day are generated a day. If the PLF drops by 1% then generation drops by 10.36 lakh units. And assuming the state utility is buying private power at Rs1 more per unit (actually it is much higher) Tangedco will lose Rs10.36 lakh per day for every 1% drop in PLF. And if the performance increases by 40%, it will mean saving Rs1,500 crore a year.

The Centre has been aggressively pushing privatisation of distribution. The Union government will encourage inefficient state power utilities to seek privatisation and other institutional reforms to turn around money-losing operations and ensure reliable supplies to consumers, according to the top bureaucrat in the Union power ministry.

Electricity utilities that lose significant revenue due to archaic networks, power theft and sloppy billing and collections would be pushed to seek private participation in their distribution network as part of the country’s planned second wave of power reforms, said union power secretary Sanjiv Nandan Sahai .

164,['11/03/2020'],"Tamil Nadu, coffee growers brew a fresh cuppa","Tribal coffee growers are now getting a fair price for their produce

UDHAGAMANDALAM: Growing of traditional organic coffee beans by tribal communities in the Kilkotagiri area of Nilgiris is getting a fresh lease of life after the state horticulture department roped in Tamil Nadu State Rural Livelihoods Mission (TNSRLM) to cut out middlemen and procure processed coffee beans from the tribal growers directly.

The coffee powder by the horticulture department is marketed under the name ‘Neelcafe’. Tribal coffee growers say after being shortchanged by private agents for years, this initiative, launched a month ago, will ensure fair price for them and quality for the consumers. The department procures coffee at the rate of `120-`130 per kg of dried coffee beans, while it was sold at `80-`100 to private agents earlier.

S Natarajan, a tribal from Semmanarai hamlet in Kilkotagiri area said, ""Earlier our produce was procured by private agents, who used to fix a price. We could not negotiate as we would not know how to market it. Moreover, we would lose a considerable quantity of the produce while weighing, as they would calculate a certain portion as wastage.""

Around 130 tribal coffee growers from various hamlets in Kilkotagiri area have partnered with the horticulture department. Semmanarai tribal groups are trying to get other coffee growers in the area. It is a win for the state department as well, which now has a quality brand in its name. ""When we came to know that organic coffee grown in tribal areas was procured at far below the market rate, we intended to pitch it in the interest of welfare of the tribal growers,"" said Shiva Subramaniam Samraj, joint director, horticulture department. TNSRLM was roped in for procurement and payment procedures. ""We are paying 30%-35% more than private agents,"" he said.

Apart from better pay, the coffee growers are also given tips on modern techniques for coffee production. ""The agents would not know the technicalities of coffee production, whereas the horticulture department advises us at various stages, right from the bloom. And if we need to more saplings, the department supplies coffee saplings free of cost. It is a double benefit for us with the horticulture department’s intervention"", Natarajan said.

Refining, roasting and powdering of the coffee beans are done by the horticulture department at its unit in Ooty. It is packed in a tin of 200g under the brand Neelcafe. ""Neelcafe is sold in all our outlets of Tamil Nadu Horticulture Development Agency in the Nilgiris.

In Kilkotahiri area about 40 tribal hamlets are located. With an average of two acres of land per family, most of the families grow tea, coffee and pepper, besides millets and vegetables. ""It is just a month since the government took this initiative. Better price for coffee beans means higher earnings for us,"" said R Siva, another resident of Semmanarai village. The horticulture department has plans to initiate a marketing design for forest honey collected by tribals in the Nilgiris soon.

As of now, the horticulture department is concentrating on Kilkotagiri area. ""Once all the tribal coffee growers are roped in under one umbrella for procurement, we will shift focus to Gudalur area, where a considerable number of tribal families grow coffee,"" said Samraj.

NEW DELHI: Who should get tested for the novel coronavirus is a question that has left several people anxious. Anyone and everyone with flu symptoms are seeking to test themselves for Covid-19 To check the panic, India’s top health research body, Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), has come up with a guideline on who should get the test done and who shouldn’t. It stated that there was currently no community transmission of the virus in the country. “The disease is primarily reported in individuals with travel history to affected countries or close contacts with positive cases. Therefore, all individuals need not be tested,” the advisory said.According to ICMR, those who have travelled to high-risk countries — China, Japan, Italy and Iran — in the past 14 days need to first quarantine themselves for two weeks. If there are no symptoms —fever, dry cough and shortness of breath — during this period, tests are not required, the guidelines clarified.If someone hasn’t travelled to the high-risk nations but has had close contact with an infected individual, even then, ICMR suggested such persons should first home quarantine themselves for two weeks. If they develop symptoms during this period, then tests for Covid-19 may be required, it added.In case a person requires testing, the ICMR officials said directly visiting a designated hospital was not advisable as the person might infect others. “All the states have deployed ambulances at strategic locations across the cities. The person can call the Union health ministry’s helpline number — 011-23978046 — and the surveillance team will get in touch with them,” said an official.In Delhi, Ram Manohar Lohia (RML) and Lady Hardinge Medical College (LHMC) hospitals can collect samples, while testing facilities are available at AIIMS and National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC).There are 51 laboratories across the country equipped to test for Covid-19. In addition, NCDC Delhi is also engaged in testing. 56 Virus Research and Diagnostic Laboratories (VRDLs) and one facility at Leh have been designated to facilitate sample collection through government health facilities.",delhi,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74586470,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-346011,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/do-fever-and-cough-mean-you-need-covid-19-test/articleshow/74584507.cms
167,['11/03/2020'],"Tamil Nadu: Now, track MTC buses on phone with ‘Chalo’ app","A screengrab of ‘Chalo’ app

CHENNAI: Just like Ola and Uber, passengers can now live track government buses in the city using ‘Chalo’ app.

The app provides details on nearest bus stops and next five Metropolitan Transport Corporation (MTC) buses scheduled to arrive at any selected stop in both online and offline modes. Users can also search timings of buses along specific authorised routes. For instance, for route 570 (Kelambakkam to Koyambedu CMBT), the app will show the source, destination and list of bus stops on the route. Also a live map, showing the present location of buses plying on the route, will be displayed for users. By selecting one of the buses, passengers may get to know when it would reach the nearest bus stop (based on GPS).

Another common confusion among passengers is route numbers. Unlike Madurai or Coimbatore, Chennai operates more than 650 routes. So, remembering route numbers is tricky. To eliminate this, the app provides the list of bus numbers between any two points. If a commuter is in T Nagar and wants to go to Nanganallur, all he/she needs to do is to enter the source and destination in the appropriate search boxes. Within seconds, the app will display information that 129C, 9M, 79 and 155A are the available options from T Nagar to Nanganallur along with approximate ticket fare in each of the buses.

By this, passengers may get to plan their travel better. “People need not rush to bus stops with uncertainty or fear of missing the next bus if we get to know when the bus will reach and where the bus is now,” said S Rengachari, a transportation activist. Also, they need not wait for a long time at bus stops. Instead, they can leave home or office after calculating the time taken for reaching the bus stop, he said.

A senior MTC official said the app is a beta version (or test-run) of the soon-to-be-launched government’s Locate My Bus App (LAMB). More than 90% of the total 3,300 MTC buses were fitted with GPS devices and brought under the app’s ambit. It will be expanded soon to other buses based on response from the public and correcting internal errors if any, he said and added, “We hope this will encourage more passengers to opt for MTC buses over cabs or share autos”. Accuracy will be within a margin of 1 minute or 10% of predicted time.

Although the work order for carpeting was issued much earlier, certain agencies were given time to lay cables and wrap up any excavation work. Panaji mayor Uday Madkaikar said no digging of roads in the city would be permitted for the next three years.

“Tender estimates for roads in the rest of Panaji are being prepared,” Madkaikar told TOI.

The corporation, in October, had issued a public notice appealing to all agencies to complete road-cutting and reinstatement. It also stated that road-cutting would not be permitted for two years to public and private agencies, government departments, other organisations, and individuals.

The state capital’s internal roads have been in pathetic condition, particularly inconveniencing two-wheeler riders. Decrepit roads had even prompted citizens to file complaints with the Goa State Human Rights Commission last year.

Motorists got some relief ahead of the International Film Festival of India that was held in the state last November, due to which roads at the entrance of Panaji as well as D B Marg were asphalted.

VMC officials took measures to remedy this and covered the photos of the CM printed on the boards.

The TOI, in its columns on Tuesday, had published the opposition parties’ requests to officials to remove banners and boards which have the photos of state ministers, including chief minister YS Jaganmohan Reddy, which explained the various government schemes.

City planning wing officials and special election officers, with directions from VMC commissioner Prasanna Venkatesh, covered the chief minister’s photos on the board in 230 ward secretariats in the city. Venkatesh said that they would strictly follow the model code of conduct and not allow any form of material that could influence voters. VMC authorities also started removing the three colours representing the YSRC flag painted on the walls of ward secretariats.

A special election help desk has been established at the VMC head office in One Town to receive complaints regarding the model code of conduct.

Opposition parties welcomed the measures taken by the VMC authorities. “We hadn’t expected such speedy action from officials. We thank VMC officials for their immediate response. Officials covered all the boards overnight. They should act in such a way till completion of polls,” said Pothina Venkata Mahesh, Jana Sena local body elections in charge.

170,['11/03/2020'],"Sonia was aware of problems, says neta in resignation letter","Bhopal: Jyotiraditya Scindia resigned from Congress on Tuesday – the 75th birth anniversary of his father, Congress stalwart Madhavrao Scindia – after 24 hours of stunning developments that plunged the Kamal Nath government into crisis .

AICC leader K C Venugopal said Scindia had been expelled from the party.

Scindia posted his resignation , dated March 9 and addressed to AICC chief Sonia Gandhi, on Twitter around noon, soon after meeting PM Narendra Modi and home minister Amit Shah in Delhi. In his letter, he said he was unable to work in the party anymore and suggests that Sonia was aware of his difficulties for the past year.

With his joining BJP, it fulfils the lifelong dream of BJP founder and his grandmother Rajmata Vijayaraje Scindia, who had wished Madhavrao would return to the saffron fold and Jyotiraditya join BJP.

Sources say BJP will nominate him to Rajya Sabha and give him a berth in the Union cabinet. Scindia had been feeling sidelined after his shock defeat in the 2019 Lok Sabha election and was desperate to stay relevant in Congress politics. Although he had repeatedly made his resentment clear, his rebellion, when it came, took his party by surprise.

A day ago, 17 MLAs and ministers of the Scindia faction had flown to Bengaluru, leaving the Nath government in MP teetering on the edge just when it felt that it had weathered an alleged poaching bid by BJP.

Scindia’s resignation letter said: “Having been a primary member of Congress for the last 18 years, it is now time for me to move on… As you well know, this is a path that has been drawing itself out over the last year.” He writes that he is unable to “serve people within this party (Congress).”

Scindia met Prime Minister Narendra Modi in New Delhi along with home minister Amit Shah around 10.30 am. Scindia was seen driving his vehicle into 7 Race Course Road where Shah was already present. The meeting lasted around 30 minutes after which Scindia drove to Shah’s house without speaking to mediapersons.

In Bhopal, the state Congress was hoping against what seemed inevitable. Scindia loyalist and state Congress working president Ram Niwas Rawat claimed that Scindia had met AICC president Sonia Gandhi late Monday night. “Congress national president Sonia Gandhi, AICC general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra and Sachin Pilot were present. The Congress government will stay. Everything will be good,” Rawat, a former minister, said. Scindia’s resignation would come just a couple of hours after this.

Former CM Digvijaya Singh said: “It is a conspiracy to bring down the Kamal Nath government because of the action taken against mafia. Fifteen years of scams and the honeytrap scandal were getting exposed. They are frightened and, therefore, want to bring down the Congress government. Shivraj Singh Chouhan is lying if he says BJP has no hand in this.”

In New Delhi, Sonia Gandhi called an emergency meeting regarding the political turmoil in Madhya Pradesh.

Former CM Shivraj Singh Chouhan returned to Bhopal week by an early morning flight and was accompanied by BJP chief whip Narottam Mishra, who is accused by Congress of planning last week’s political crisis.

Mishra, however, said: “As per my knowledge, this government is falling. I can personally see it going.” Asked if Scindia will join BJP, Mishra said, “Scindia is a big leader. Everyone is welcome to BJP.”

The state Congress has called a legislative party meeting at 5pm and BJP has also called its MLAs for a meeting at 7pm.

When the drains near Azad Maidan were cleaned last week, workers took out a truckload of plastic bottles which were clogging drains. Panaji ’s flooding problem is partly attributed to drains blocked by plastic waste.

“Two teams have been put on the job. We began work on March 1. Last year, desilting work began mid-April,” mayor Uday Madkaikar told TOI.

Larger stormwater drains will be built between Bal Bhavan and Miramar circle as part of the Smart City project, the tender for which will be floated after the code of conduct is lifted, Madkaikar said.

The city witnessed one of the worst floodings during the last monsoon, when 18th June road had to be shut more than twice. Residents in low-lying Mala were also inconvenienced as water had entered their homes on multiple occasions.

The Goa Human Rights Commission received two complaints last year over flooding in Panaji, highlighting the complete failure on the part of the CCP to manage basic infrastructure.

The commission had called for reports from the chief secretary and commissioner of the corporation of the city of Panaji following the complaint where pictures were attached of the city including its commercial street 18th June road.

The complainant sought immediate directions to the CCP to immediately take steps to solve the problem on humanitarian grounds and save property in public interest.

CHENNAI: Three people, including a man and his son, arrested on Monday for murdering a lift operator at Chithalapakkam have admitted during questioning that they had in November last year killed a woman. After they were booked in the two cases of murder, a court sent Xavier Arul, 45, his son Michael Vijay, 19, and Xavier’s friend Amalraj, 32, to jail.

On Sunday, a police offficer said, Xavier Arul and Michael Vijay of Medavakkam, and Amalraj of Perumbakkam invited Henry alias Little John, 38, a lift operator, to the banks of the Chithalapakkam lake for drinking. Henry often drank with Arul, the officer said.

After a while, Arul asked Henry to part with his one sovereign gold chain. When he refused, Arul snatched the chain and pushed Henry into the lake. Vijay and Amalraj preesed him down. After confirming he was dead, they escaped in Arul’s autorickshaw.

Some residents noticed the body on Monday morning and informed police. A team led by Pallikaranai inspector Alagu sent the body to Government General Hospital for postmortem.

After some residents said they saw an autorickshaw leaving the lake in the wee hours of Monday and gave the registration number, police traced the vehicle to Arul and picked him up. After he confessed that he murdered Henry to steal his gold chain, police nabbed Vijay and Amalraj.

Further questioning revealed that the trio had murdered 23-year-old Prabha (name changed), a native of Chengam in Tiruvannamalai district . An orphan, she was a saleswoman at a textile showroom in Velachery.

Vijay, who also owns an autorickshaw, often dropped his sister at the same showroom and befriended Prabha, four years older to him. They began a relationship and Prabha became pregnant. She insisted that Vijay marry her. He informed his father who asked him to bring her to the Chithalapakkam lake for a settlement. On November 18, Vijay brought the woman to a spot where the three men pushed her into the lake and she drowned.

Police came to know about the body only November 21 after being informed by some residents of the area. A team rushed to the spot and sent the to the Rajiv Gandhi Government General Hospital.

The body was already bloated and fully decomposed, the doctors who examined it said. Police personnel traced the identity of the woman and later they handed over the body to her relatives in Chengam.

174,['11/03/2020'],Tamil Nadu: Nilgiris hydel power projects may get green nod without public hearings,"CHENNAI: Two major hydroelectric projects in eco-sensitive Nilgiris planned by the state government-run Tamil Nadu Generation and Distribution Company (Tangedco) are likely to get environmental clearances without the mandatory public hearings.

A central government-appointed sub-committee, which inspected the project site in December 2019, had recommended to the Union Environment Ministry to exempt hearings to avoid further delays and cost overruns. Recently, this suggestion was accepted by Expert Appraisal Committee (EAC), which advises the ministry on eco-clearances.

The decision was taken amidst heavy opposition from locals. Even on January 5, more than 2,000 people gathered at Balacola village to participate in a meeting against the project claiming that it will affect their agricultural fields, nearby forests and water bodies.

“At any cost, public hearing shouldn’t be cancelled. Already natural resources are depleted at unsustainable rate. We should pay at least minimum respect to the environment,” said T Bhojan from Nilgiris Small Farmers Association.

The hydroelectric projects, worth Rs 1,832 crore, were launched in 2007 to facilitate continuous supply of electricity and to meet peak power demands of the state grid.

The projects at Kundah and Sillahalla will have nine powerhouses with a capacity of 735 MW. Besides this, access tunnels, pressure shafts, penstocks and other components will be installed to generate power from existing reservoirs (Avalanche and Porthimund) there.

From 2007 to 2012, not much progress was reported due to paucity of funds and non-availability of surplus power.

Though adequate funds were released after 2012, announcement of GST and pending court cases caused further delay. New rates under GST forced re-evaluation of bids, show official documents.

Meanwhile, validity of the Environmental Clearance (EC) given to the Kundah project expired in 2017. Though it was extended, construction works were still pending.

So the Union environment ministry in October 2019 told Tangedco to initiate the process of obtaining fresh environment clearance and the EAC, in response, formed a new sub-committee to inspect the site in December 2019.

This sub-committee agreed to Tangedco’s proposal to exempt the projects from public hearings to avoid delays. “Whatever be the solution, it should be ensured that project works continue as further delay in hydro-power commissioning means not only cost over-run but also more thermal electricity by burning coal and environmental damage, the sub-committee said.

“However, in any case, sufficient opportunity is also to be given to so-called affected people and stakeholders for raising concerns on the project, if any,” its report said.

Tangedco stated that tentative commissioning schedule of the Kundah project is May 2023. Recently, tenders were awarded for electro-mechanical works and more than Rs 200 crore has been sanctioned in three packages.

175,['11/03/2020'],Anna Salai bomb attack aftermath: Police begin crackdown on gangs,"Representative image

CHENNAI: The city police have started a crackdown on the underworld after the uproar over the March 3 incident when gang war spilled on to Anna Salai with two bikers throwing country-made explosives at an SUV carrying two history-sheeters and triggering panic among other road users.

Eight special teams have been formed to arrest gangsters active in the underworld. In police records, the rowdies are categorised as ‘A-plus’, ‘A’, ‘B’ and ‘C’. There are about 40 ‘A-plus’ category rowdies active in the city, some of whom have gone underground or are now active in other parts of the state.

On Tuesday, police arrested ‘Pulianthope’ Ezhil, a close associate of history-sheeter ‘Arcot’ Suresh who was arrested in May last year and is cooling his heels in Puzhal prison. A team led by inspector Krishnamurthy cornered Ezhil alias Ezhilarasan at gunpoint at his house at Pulianthope, acting on a tip and laying a trap deploying plainclothes men.

Ezhil has a history sheet record opened at the Pulianthope police station and is accused in about a dozen cases including two murders, two attempts to murder and an extortion. He was earlier detained under the Goondas Act thrice.

Meanwhile, ‘Kakkathoppu’ Balaji and C D Mani, the two gangsters who were in the SUV targeted in the country-bomb attack, have gone to ground. Police sources said they suspect the two are hiding somewhere in Andhra Pradesh to evade arrest.

Police are also on the lookout for ‘Sambo’ Senthil, who they suspect ordered the hit in a bid to become head honcho of the Chennai underworld. In fact, a Madras high court lawyer, Thangaraj, who was driving C D Mani’s SUV when country bombs were thrown at it, and Mani, himself, have given separate complaints to the Teynampet police station demanding action against Senthil. Police arrested a college dropout D Mahesh and a juvenile in connection with the bomb attack. Four men, Johnson, Kamaluddin, Prashanth and Rajasekar, surrendered before a court in Madurai on March 5 and three more suspects, Tamil Selvan, Satish and Harish, surrendered before a court in Tenkasi.

Gang tensions are so high that Puzhal prison officials have shifted the people arrested for the bomb attack to the central prison in Salem to avoid clashes in jail.

This was the fifth year in a row where Tibet had this worrying rank, the group said. There was increasing and continuing oppression of Tibetans under Chinese occupation. Since 2009, 154 Tibetans have self-immolated with the latest being on November 26 last year.The group also expressed their appreciation for India and its people who stood in solidarity with their cause.",chennai,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74571245,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-312106,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/tibetans-in-city-decry-lack-of-transparency-in-china/articleshow/74567883.cms
177,['11/03/2020'],No BJP infighting if Parrikar were alive: Dilip Parulekar,"Representative image

PANAJI: Former tourism minister and BJP functionary Dilip Parulekar on Tuesday said if former chief minister Manohar Parrikar were alive, he would not have allowed infighting in BJP.

Parulekar was referring to some of former BJP MLAs who had recently protested the party’s decision to deny either them or their relatives a ticket for the upcoming zilla panchayat polls. Some had even taken offence to senior party functionaries promoting the kin of recently inducted Congress MLAs, he said.

Former Sanguem MLA Subhash Phal Desai had recently targeted Rajya Sabha MP Vinay Tendulkar for sharing the stage with Savitri Kavalekar, wife of deputy chief minister Chandrakant Kavalekar, at a function in Sanguem. Phal Dessai’s statement had drawn a sharp reaction from Tendulkar who said that as Rajya Sabha MP, he was free to attend any function he was invited to.

In another instance, former Tivim MLA Kiran Kandolkar had targeted the party leadership for not giving a zilla panchayat ticket to his wife for the Colvale constituency. He had also accused party functionaries of systematically targeting one particular section of society to end the political careers of those who represent it.

Parulekar told reporters that Parrikar would sit with the karyakartas and resolve issues. “If Parrikar were alive, no karyakarta would have approached the media to speak against the party,” he said.

Reacting to Kandolkar’s statement that party functionaries like Parulekar have been marginalised and suppressed, the former Saligao MLA said Kandolkar should not drag his name for political gains. He also said he has explained his position to the party over Kandolkar’s statement and maintained that he was strongly with BJP.

178,['11/03/2020'],Industries violating Air Act to be fined,"Panaji: Industries operating in the state without the consent of the Goa State Pollution Control Board ( GSPCB ) under the Water Act and Air Act may soon face action, as the board has constituted an enforcement cell to bring such errant units under its consent mechanism.

GSPCB chairman Ganesh Shetgaonkar said that the board has formed the cell to act against those industries operating without consent to operate. “Once we find industries operating without consent to operate, we will issue them show cause notices and ask them to obtain the consent,” he said.

The decision to constitute the enforcement cell was taken at the last board meeting. The objective of the cell is to visit industries and units to verify whether or not they are operating with consent. If the cell finds that the units are operating without consent, it also has the power to issue show cause notices, closure directions, or to initiate criminal action and impose fines.

The board has already issued letters to municipalities and panchayats to give details of industries registered with them. Most local bodies have already furnished the details. The board will now scrutinise the data and issue show cause notices to erring units. Those units operating without consent will then have to apply for consent.

The Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) has categorized industries as red, orange, green and white. ‘White’ industries do not require consent to operate, but have to inform the board about their activities. The other three categories require consent to operate. The board issues consent to red for five years, yellow for 10 years, and orange for 15 years.

179,['11/03/2020'],Water supply from Narmada dam to continue,"Gandhinagar: In a major relief for the farmers in the Narmada and Kadana dam command areas, the state government has decided to supply water for agriculture for another 20 days and 15 days respectively. During a discussion in the assembly on Tuesday, deputy CM Nitin Patel said, “I was to announce supply of water from the Narmada and Kadana dams for irrigation during discussion on Narmada project, but when the issue was raised today, I consulted the CM over the issue.” Patel said that the government has decided that the water supply for the agriculture sector, which was discontinued on March 15, will now continue for more days keeping in view the unseasonal rains and the delay in sowing of crops.

“Narmada water will be supplied for 20 more days from March 16, and the water from Kadana dam will be supplied to Anand and nearby areas for 15 days from March 16,” he said.

The issue was raised by Savli MLA Ketan Inamdar. Inamdar during the discussion said that the farmers are already in distress due to unseasonal rains and change in weather and hence in order to save the standing crop the government should supply Narmada and Kadana water for agriculture.

Patel further said that in order to provide one million acre feet water to Kutch, the government has decided to create a network at the cost of Rs 312 crore. This will create irrigation facility for 57,850 hectares of land. He said that the second phase Sauni project is on the verge of completion and in ten districts, 57 dams will be filled creating irrigation facility for 3.78 lakh acre area. Projects worth Rs 2,403 crore are in progress under phase-II of Sauni Project.

180,['11/03/2020'],"School reopens, but kin of victim call for action","New Delhi: Even as police permitted the Rajdhani School in Shiv Vihar to reopen on Wednesday, the family of Rahul Solanki — who was shot dead allegedly by people firing from the terrace of the school — staged a protest demanding that all building used as vantage points by rioters in northeast Delhi recently remain sealed. A forensics team lifted evidence from the school on Wednesday. Given the disturbances, the school has postponed the imminent exams.

Rajdhani School was in the news after the arrest of its owner Farooq Faisal, whose lawyer, Shams Khwaja, said on Wednesday, “Without an explanation on why they sealed the school, the cops sheepishly reopened the building.”

On Wednesday afternoon, Hari Singh Solanki, whose son was shot dead during the communal riots, led a protest outside the school and demanded to see the order permitting the school to reopen. The father of the deceased said, “I lost my young son in the violence and they have opened the school from where the violence originated. How can they do this when there is clear evidence of rioters gathering on the school roof?”

Another area resident, Sonu, added, “Police sealed every building whose roofs were used as vantage points by rioters, including that of councillor Tahir Hussain. So, why is seal on the school being removed? Shouldn’t they then also should open all the sealed properties?”

Police officers, however, denied having sealed the school. “We had only cordoned off the crime area. After the visit of the forensics team on Wednesday, we freed the area for use,” said Ved Prakash Surya, DCP (Northeast).

Farooq Ahmed Nawab, Faisal’s father and co-owner of the school, said the atmosphere was not conducive to the school functioning. “We cannot hold exams when people are protesting. The safety of the children is our first priority,” said Nawab. “Keeping in mind the safety, security of the students and the prevailing environment we have decided to not hold the exams for students.” said Farooq.

A catapult used by the mob to pelt stones was recovered from the terrace of the school. It is alleged that violence spread from the school to the surrounding localities. Shiv Vihar was among the worst hit by the communal violence and resembled a ghost town with houses vacated in a hurry by traumatised people.

181,['11/03/2020'],"For elusive CZMP, another deadline set to whoosh past","Panaji: The state government is set to yet again miss the National Green Tribunal’s (NGT) deadline to complete the long-pending coastal zone management plan (CZMP) for the state, since the National Centre for Sustainable Coastal Management (NCSCM) is yet to submit a draft CZMP and hold the public hearing.

The NGT had directed NCSCM, the Chennai-based agency entrusted with drawing up the plan, to submit the final draft after a public hearing to the Union environment ministry by March 31, 2020. It also said that the final notification has to be issued before April 30, 2020.

“The deadline cannot be met as a notice of one month has to be issued for public hearing once the draft CZMP is received,” said a senior official in the environment department. He said that once the hearing is conducted, the government again has to accept or reject the objections and suggestions given by the public at the meeting.

The state government has written to NCSCM to know the status of the draft CZMP, an official said. The centre also has to incorporate the new high tide line (HTL) in the CZMP.

The state government had directed the department of survey and land records (DSLR) to map all the bunds and sluice gates across the state and furnish the details to the NCSCM.

Recently, the National Coastal Zone Management Authority (NCZMA) accepted the state government’s request to demarcate the high tide line (HTL) along bunds and not around mangroves in khazan lands for CZMP. It, however, rejected the state’s plea seeking reduction of the no-development zone (NDZ) for headlands to 10 metres.

A number of village panchayats and municipalities had earlier demanded that the HTL be demarcated along bunds and not around mangroves. They had even submitted their respective CZMPs to the Goa Coastal Zone Management Authority (GCZMA).

During a presentation to the national authority, the GCZMA had highlighted the impact breached bunds have had on CRZ boundaries in khazan lands that are eco-sensitive, low-lying areas traditionally not influenced by tidal action.

It had consequently demanded that the demarcation of HTL in khazan lands that have been inundated due to breach of bunds be dropped, and that the HTL be restricted up to the bunds and be mapped as such.

In August 2019, the government sought three months extention to complete the CZMP but could not complete it.

In November 2019, it sought another extention.

The first CZMP for Goa was prepared in 1996. However, this was done without survey numbers, and was considered a base plan for the 2011 CZMP.

But when the public began getting notices for demolition of houses, then chief minister Manohar Parrikar took the plan up seriously and asked the NCSCM to prepare the 2016 CZMP.

183,['11/03/2020'],"After 3 teens die, voice to cordon off Verna plateau grows stronger","Panaji: The issue of three teenagers losing their lives in a car accident in Verna figured at the South Goa consumer protection council meeting held in Margao on Monday where members called for immediate solution to tackle underage driving.

“This is a clear wake-up call because three teens have died in a single incident,” said , the Goa Consumer Action Network ( GOACAN ) convener Roland Martins.

Three minors — Joshua Barreto, 15, Rowan Sequeira, 14, and Ethan Fernandes, 15 — died in the accident involving a four-wheeler at the Verna plateau near the industrial estate on Sunday. Police said the car was speeding, and it veered out of control while the driver was manoeuvring the difficult terrain, leading to the vehicle hitting the rocks, leaving the car a mangled wreck. As all the three occupants died, it is not known where the teenagers had gone.

GOACAN has written to various stakeholders to cordon off the area where the accident occurred and to come up with immediate solutions to tackle underage driving.

It raised the issue at the meeting of the sub-committee on road safety at the South Goa consumer protection council was held on Monday.

“We have written to the managing director of the industrial developmental corporation (IDC), the chief engineer of the PWD and the Goa traffic police to involve the Verna industries estate association and take a quick decision to cordon off the area,” Martins said.

He further said that there are roads in the area being developed for the expansion of the estate. The area is very private and isolated, making it conducive for youngsters to engage in drag races. “The road must therefore be barricaded until there is surveillance or CCTV cameras are installed there. We want all authorities to have a joint meeting and come up with solutions as fast as possible,” Martins said.

GOACAN has also written to the South Goa district collector highlighting the issue of underage driving and requested that a meeting of heads of institutions in South Goa be convened. Martins also suggested that the Goa board of secondary and higher secondary education, SCERT and education department conduct road safety awareness programmes in schools.

“Enforcement is one thing, but the larger question is to impart education to students and their parents,” he said.

VIJAYAWADA: Nuzvid police seized over 3.2 tonnes of chicken waste manure , which was being ferried illegally in a lorry, near Yanamadala village under Nuzvid Mandal in Krishna district on Monday night. The manure was being transported illegally from Hyderabad in Telangana to Eluru in West Godavari district in AP.

The police said that they have nabbed three persons P Prabhu Kishore (the lorry driver), BR Babu (the assistant driver) and M Srinivasa Rao (owner of the vehicle) and booked them under relevant sections of IPC. “Chicken manure was being transported to be used as food in fish ponds in West Godavari district,” the police added.

P Ramachandra Rao, inspector of Nuzvid police station, said that the use of chicken waste for feeding is banned as the consumption of such fish will be harmful to humans. “Despite the ban, some farmers in Krishna and West Godavari districts have been using it for feeding the fish,” Rao said.

The police said that they are planning to nab the suppliers of the chicken waste manure and also the farmers who are procuring the waste at the cost of the health of fish consumers, they added.

The orders are now expected to be passed next month.

In December 2019, the mines department had completed the hearings, and the orders were supposed to be passed in January.

The government recently transferred Ashutosh Apte as mines director and brought in Arvind Bugde to head the department.

The DMG had issued notices to 42 lease-holders to file their final replies in the matter and commenced final hearings in October 2019. Prior to that, it had evaluated replies from the holders of 118 mining leases to the audit report.

In 2015, the state government had appointed 15 chartered accountants to undertake audit of lease holders and traders of mineral ore in Goa for a five-year period, when exports peaked.

They were asked to examine the exact quantity of ore extracted and exported, the amount of royalties paid, export duty, and ore (if any) sourced from other states to ascertain the exact loss of revenue. The accountants had submitted an audit report of 118 mining leases to the mines department. However, the chartered accountants are yet to begin the audit of 260 iron ore traders.

PANAJI: People may get some relief from high fines after the implementation of the Motor Vehicles (Amendment) Act, 2019, as the state government has decided to reduce fines for certain traffic violations. A file has been moved to the law department for vetting purposes, said transport minister Mauvin Godinho on Tuesday, adding that the act will be implemented before April.

Godinho told TOI that he has prepared a list of offences for which fines can be reduced. It will be put before the cabinet for a final decision. He also said that the implementation of the new M V (amendment) act has been delayed because the code of conduct is in force.

Godinho said the file which is with the law department has not been sent back to the transport department due to the model code of conduct. Former transport minister and MGP senior member Ramkrishna ‘Sudin’ Dhavalikar on Monday had demanded Godinho resign over not implementing the M V (amendment) act in the state and blamed it for fatal accidents.

“Once the file is back from the law department it will be placed before the cabinet to decide on reduction of fines and the implementation,” he said. Godinho also said that during the last meeting with Union minister Nitin Gadkari he had discussed what fines can be reduced and what cannot. He also said that the state has some leverage to reduce fines in certain violations but not all.

Godinho said that for riding a bike without a helmet the Union government has increased the fine from Rs 100 to Rs 1,000, but the state wants to restrict the fine to Rs 500. “In no parking cases, fines have been increased from Rs 100 to Rs 1,000, but we will try to restrict it to Rs 500. But the cabinet will take the final decision,” he said.

The new legislation came into force across the country from September 1, 2019, onwards. However, after some state governments raised concerns regarding some of the hiked fines, they were permitted to impose lower penalties for certain traffic violations. Godinho said the state cannot touch fines for drunken driving or driving without a licence.

Reacting to Dhavalikar over races taking place in the state, Godinho said that the department takes action from time to time and will implement the law strictly. Once the new M V act is implemented, we have told parents that there will be a heavy fine, and vehicles would be compounded in racing cases.

The carts had been set afire by an angry mob on February 24, leaving the fruit vendors without a means of livelihood.

Mustafabad resident Mohammad Ikram has been selling fruit on the Bhajanpura main road for the past two decades. “On February 24, I lost my cart, my goods and all that I had earned for the day to the rioting. When violence broke out we ran away, and on returning found only the charred remains of our carts. At least 30 of us used to gather there with our fruit carts,” said Ikram.

Arif, who also worked in the same area, said, “We have been out of work for two weeks. The mob burnt our carts and took away the fruits.”

On Wednesday, when he got a new cart from Khalsa Aid India, Ikram was beside himself with joy, both relief and happiness evident in his huge smile. Asked how he felt now that he had a cart again, the fruit vendor said, “God is helping these Sikh people and they are helping us in turn. They are assisting us in beginning our lost lives again. We can once more earn the money we require to survive.”

The rehabilitation volunteers had finalised a list of 50 vendors after verifying their claims. Most of them sold fruit, others snacks and chicken soup. Each cart costs around Rs 12,000.

“For the street vendors, their only source of income is their cart. We met each of the affected vendors,” said Amarpreet Singh from Patiala, Asia Pacific director of Khalsa Aid. “So far we have identified 50 who lost their carts. Our contractor got carts made for them. We will continue distributing the carts in phases to enable the people to begin life anew.”

Khalsa Aid has also been providing food every night since February 26 to the riot-affected families in northeast Delhi.

BHOPAL: Jyotiraditya Scindia resigned from Congress on Tuesday – the 75th birth anniversary of his father, Congress stalwart Madhavrao Scindia – after 24 hours of stunning developments that plunged MP's Kamal Nath government into crisis.AICC leader K C Venugopal said Scindia had been expelled from the party.Scindia posted his resignation, dated March 9 and addressed to AICC chief Sonia Gandhi, on Twitter around noon, soon after meeting PM Narendra Modi and home minister Amit Shah in Delhi. In his letter, he said he was unable to work in the party anymore and suggests that Sonia was aware of his difficulties for the past year.With his joining BJP, it fulfils the lifelong dream of BJP founder and his grandmother Rajmata Vijayaraje Scindia, who had wished Madhavrao would return to the saffron fold and Jyotiraditya join BJP.Sources say BJP will nominate him to Rajya Sabha and give him a berth in the Union cabinet. Scindia had been feeling sidelined after his shock defeat in the 2019 Lok Sabha election and was desperate to stay relevant in Congress politics. Although he had repeatedly made his resentment clear, his rebellion, when it came, took his party by surprise.A day ago, 17 MLAs and ministers of the Scindia faction had flown to Bengaluru, leaving the Nath government in MP teetering on the edge just when it felt that it had weathered an alleged poaching bid by BJP.Scindia’s resignation letter said: “Having been a primary member of Congress for the last 18 years, it is now time for me to move on… As you well know, this is a path that has been drawing itself out over the last year.” He writes that he is unable to “serve people within this party (Congress).”Scindia met Prime Minister Narendra Modi in New Delhi along with home minister Amit Shah around 10.30 am. Scindia was seen driving his vehicle into 7 Race Course Road where Shah was already present. The meeting lasted around 30 minutes after which Scindia drove to Shah’s house without speaking to mediapersons.In Bhopal, the state Congress was hoping against what seemed inevitable. Scindia loyalist and state Congress working president Ram Niwas Rawat claimed that Scindia had met AICC president Sonia Gandhi late Monday night. “Congress national president Sonia Gandhi, AICC general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra and Sachin Pilot were present. The Congress government will stay. Everything will be good,” Rawat, a former minister, said. Scindia’s resignation would come just a couple of hours after this.Former CM Digvijaya Singh said: “It is a conspiracy to bring down the Kamal Nath government because of the action taken against mafia. Fifteen years of scams and the honeytrap scandal were getting exposed. They are frightened and, therefore, want to bring down the Congress government. Shivraj Singh Chouhan is lying if he says BJP has no hand in this.”In New Delhi, Sonia Gandhi called an emergency meeting regarding the political turmoil in Madhya Pradesh.Former CM Shivraj Singh Chouhan returned to Bhopal week by an early morning flight and was accompanied by BJP chief whip Narottam Mishra, who is accused by Congress of planning last week’s political crisis.Mishra, however, said: “As per my knowledge, this government is falling. I can personally see it going.” Asked if Scindia will join BJP, Mishra said, “Scindia is a big leader. Everyone is welcome to BJP.”The state Congress has called a legislative party meeting at 5pm and BJP has also called its MLAs for a meeting at 7pm.",india,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74568047,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-66301,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/sonia-was-aware-of-problems-says-scindia-in-resignation-letter/articleshow/74568040.cms
189,['11/03/2020'],"Govt plans long-term rehab, may launch next phase soon","New Delhi: With relief work in the riot-hit northeast Delhi “streamlined,” the AAP government will now shift its focus on long-term rehabilitation measures, including psycho-social counselling, livelihood and peacebuilding .

Senior Delhi government officials said deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia , who is closely monitoring the relief work, is likely to officially launch the Phase-II of relief and rehabilitation work in the next few days.

At least 53 people were killed and nearly 500 injured in the communal clashes that took place in the last week of February. A large number of people reported loss of properties with their houses and shops set afire and kiosks, carts, rickshaws, etc., burnt. A trade body pegged the total loss in violence at Rs 25,000 crore.

Delhi government set up camps, involved not-for-profit organisations, volunteers, civil society and AAP workers to provide shelter, basic amenities and compensation to hundreds of people.

Abhinandita Mathur, who led the relief work, said collective efforts were made to reach out to victims and provide them relief. “For the next phase, non-government organisations may be roped in for their specific expertise,” she said.

Sources said Sisodia has directed the officials to wind up the disbursement of compensation claims at the earliest and move on to the next stage of rehabilitation.

The peacebuilding effort will involve the government, police, local authorities, officials of government departments and volunteers, who will hold peace marches across the riot-affected areas and work on confidence building among the victims.

“The focus of the government is to bring people back to their houses. The victims are scared and that is why they have been reluctant to return. We will try to rebuild the trust of people and provide the victims long-term rehabilitation. The government agencies, along with NGOs, are setting up spaces and even repairing damaged properties to help the people resume a normal life,” said an official.

The government has also decided to provide the victims with psycho-social counselling to get over the trauma. The sight of their friends or kin getting injured or dying, and properties and vehicles being set on fire in front of their eyes has left a deep scar on the minds of the victims, which will take a lot of time and efforts to go.

“Agencies that have expertise in dealing with such cases will be involved. A detailed plan will be prepared soon,” said an official.

Sources said the government may even consider providing rickshaws, carts and machines to help the affected people rebuild their businesses and start earning a livelihood. “Many people have lost everything to the violence. We will have to find a way to help them so that they could start earning again,” said another official.

190,['11/03/2020'],"ED files case against PFI, Tahir Hussain","New Delhi: The Enforcement Directorate has registered a case under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act against Popular Front of India (PFI), an organisation dedicated to “Islamist causes”, which has been under probe for the past few months for alleged funding of anti-CAA protests . The agency also booked suspended AAP councillor Tahir Hussain.

Hussain has been arrested by Delhi Police and is an accused in the murder of Intelligence Bureau official Ankit Sharma during the Delhi riots which broke out over protests against the Citizenship Amendment Act.

During questioning, senior PFI functionaries are learnt to have admitted to certain transactions linking the outfit to funding of anti-CAA protests in the capital and some other places, sources said.

The agency had questioned several people connected with PFI at its Delhi headquarters and found evidence of collection of Rs 120 crore, at least Rs 50 crore of which came as cash donations for which the source was not disclosed. The PFI is headquartered at Shaheen Bagh in Delhi.

The ED has also seized a tab from PFI’s Delhi unit president Parvez Ahmed which it claimed has records of a chain of conversations between him and a Rajya Sabha MP of a leading Delhi party, allegedly coordinating anti-CAA protests at Shaheen Bagh and the separate violence at JNU earlier.

The ED has questioned office-bearers of PFI and another outfit linked to it, Rehab Foundation of India (RFI). Those spoken to include Parvez Ahmed, RIF trustee Shahid Abookacker, PFI Delhi secretary Abdul Muqeet, RIF general secretary Remiz Muhammed, PFI national secretary Anis Ahmed, RIF secretary Afsel Chandrankandy and PFI’s national headquarters accountant K P Jaseer.

The AAP councillor and PFI office-bearers are likely to be arrested by the ED in the next few weeks, sources said.

COLVA: Panic over coronavirus and the resultant demand for masks has opened a new avenue for pharmacists to cash in on with some creating artificial shortage.

In Margao, pharmacy owners under the garb of rationing sales are selling two masks per person, and that too at a higher price.

A disposable face mask which is available under normal circumstances at Rs 15 is being sold at Rs 20 to Rs 40, while the reusable N-95 and 3M versions, which generally costs, Rs 80 to Rs 100, are offered in the range of Rs 100 to Rs 350.

The reusable masks contain filters and can be used over a week with a simple rinse in water. Some pharmacies in the commercial capital of Goa have already exhausted their stock and those who have inventory, are jacking up the prices.

A customer at a pharmacy seeking six masks had to remain content with just two, and that too at Rs 35 per piece. She told TOI that just last week she had paid Rs 20 for the same mask.

Another pharmacist said that before the outbreak of coronavirus, his sale of disposable masks was just 2-3 a day and the target group was two-wheeler riders. But now, he makes daily sales of 30-50 reusable masks.

The sale of sanitizers and liquid soaps has also increased three-fold.

One of the pharmacists who has run out of stock disclosed that her order for fresh consignment is pending since last week.

A senior citizen said when demand competes with supply, then unethical business practices come into play.

Over the past month, residents of the wards, located near Bhatpal and Ozrem, have sighted the leopards multiple times.

With no help coming from forest authorities, the villagers have now resorted to forming groups to keep guard over their dogs, pigs, poultry and calves, well into the wee hours of the morning.

A resident Damiao Fernandes told TOI that the big cats are sighted late in the evenings and sometimes around 6am. “We are forced to keep our dogs indoors, but the other animals have to stay outside. Since the big cats come in anytime after 8pm, the residents have a tough time guarding their domestic animals,” said Fernandes.

Another resident Brigito Coutinho, who has pigs and Jersey cows, has to be vigilant throughout the night as a female leopard has been sighted around his farm, with two cubs.

“After several pigs were attacked, I started keeping them in the pig enclosure overnight. Recently, the leopards have become more daring and even attempted to attack the calves ,” said Coutinho.

195,['11/03/2020'],"Cyclones follow unconventional tracks, may be a challenge: Navy","PANAJI: A study conducted by the Indian Navy on cyclones from 1999 to 2019, including three cyclones in the past year, found that in most of the cases, the cyclones did not follow conventional paths, thus making navigation at sea a challenge.

The study, conducted by the Directorate of Naval Oceanology and Meteorology (DNOM), also found that rapid intensification of cyclonic storms is going to pose a challenge in the foreseeable future , though the forecast accuracy has increased.

“The study on the cyclones in the month of November from 1999 to 2019 has revealed an important fact that in majority of the cases, the classical track of the cyclone was not followed strictly,” said the DNOM report titled ‘Unconventional Tracks of Tropical Cyclones in Northern Indian Ocean’.

According to the ministry of shipping, 90% of India’s external trade is carried out through the seas.

The Navy’s oceanographers studied the three cyclones—Kyar, Maha, and Bulbul—that formed over the north Indian Ocean between October 24 and November 9 last year. The Navy, along with other disaster relief agencies, were called in to carry out Humanitarian and Disaster Relief (HADR) operations.

The Navy felt the need to analyse the cyclones to see if there is a change in pattern or the cyclonic paths. It also wanted to check if the guidelines for avoidance and navigation through a cyclone needed to be reviewed.

“The perceived ‘unconventional’ paths of the cyclone do not warrant any change in the standard operating procedure for navigation as long as the tracks of the cyclone can be predicted with a fair degree of accuracy. However, it is to be noted that rapid intensification of storms may leave shorter reaction times even if the paths are accurately predicted,” the Navy’s top researchers said in the study.

The Navy’s study said that with tremendous improvement in satellite imagery and early warning systems, the ability to forecast with accuracy a cyclone’s intensity and its projected path, has increased. “The issuance of timely warnings shall be of crucial importance,” the naval report said.

Speaking to reporters following a a coordination meeting with senior officials of various departments of TTD at Tirumala on Tuesday, additional EO AV Dharma Reddy said the temple administration would maintain a buffer stock of ‘Tirupati Laddu’ prasadam to cope with the increase in demand during the summer.

He pointed out that during last year’s summer vacations 21.92 lakh devotees visited Tirumala in April, 25.07 lakh in May, 25.05 lakh in June and 24.15 lakh devotees in July. At that time, TTD distributed 1.15 crore laddus in April, 1.14 crore laddus in May, 1.16 crore laddus in June and 1.16 crore laddus in July.

The number of devotees who tonsured their heads last year was 9.47 lakh in April, 12.73 lakh devotees in May and 12.88 lakh devotees in June.

Mentioning these statistics, TTD’s additional EO Dharma Reddy said the temple administration expected a minimum of 2-3% rise in figures this summer.

In view of heavy influx of devotees expected during the summer vacation, the temple wing, annaprasadam wing, Vaikuntam Q complex, reception, medical health and sanitation have all been instructed to make additional arrangements in terms of anna prasadams, laddus, queue lines and the like.

“Most of the devotees walk barefoot at Tirumala. To reduce the inconvenience caused to them walking barefoot in the scorching summer, we are painting cool paints at key roads across Tirumala,” Dharma Reddy said.

Pointing out that packaged drinking water was prohibited at Tirumala, TTD’s additional EO appealed to the devotees to carry steel or copper water bottles along with them during their pilgrimage. “We have set up 150 plus RO plants across Tirumala ,” he added.

TTD also appealed to devotees suffering from coronavirus symptoms to postpone their visit.

198,['11/03/2020'],Tension prevails as devotees clash over rights to perform rituals at Balli temple,"Police restrict the 400-strong group from entering the temple premises

QUEPEM: Tension prevailed at the Bhumipurush and Mahamaya temples at Khadem in Balli on Tuesday morning after a section of devotees were denied entry to perform rituals based on an order issued by the deputy collector of Quepem.

This is the first time after 12 years that rituals were performed at the temple.

Activities had come to a standstill after dispute had broken out between two groups of devotees headed by Guno Velip and Ram Gaonkar , respectively, with each claiming exclusive rights over performing of the puja and other observances. Both parties had approached the court, which had directed the deputy collector to decide on the matter.

Tuesday saw a heavy police force deployed near the temple. Two IRB platoons, including Margao DySP Serafin Dias and his Colva, Fatorda, Maina-Curtorim and Vasco police teams were stationed on site since Monday night. Quepem deputy collector Rohit Kadam, mamlatdar Ramesh Gaonkar and joint mamlatdar Rosario Fernandes arrived in the morning. Tension brewed post 9.30am when the Gaonkar group arrived. Devotees headed by Velip had already finished with the rituals and left. Police stopped the over 400-strong group and informed them of the deputy collector’s order that only entitles the Velip group to retain possession of the temple and allows only their representatives to be appointed temple priest in charge of carrying out all rituals.

The devotees, including women, had come with their ceremonial umbrellas and tried to enter forcibly. Kadam informed them that as per his order they cannot enter with their umbrellas. He directed those bearing the ceremonial insignia to complete their circumambulation outside the cordoned area and told the rest that they could enter the temple. Arguments ensued.

The order allows the Gaonkar-led devotees to enter the temple premises only to pray and disallows them from offering any puja or rituals to the deity.

The group had challenged the order in the district and sessions court, but failed to get a stay.

Gaonkar told TOI that the deputy collector had done them injustice. He said that South Goa collector Ajit Roy had verbally told them that they could enter the temple to perform puja when they approached him on Monday evening.

The Gaonkar group left around 12.30pm without entering the temple.

199,['11/03/2020'],MSME losses skyrocket sharply over one quarter,"Panaji: In a worrying sign for Goa’s economy, the number of micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) running into losses and unable to repay loans jumped sharply from 1.9% in June 2019 to 13% in September.

Data shared by banks on the flow of credit to MSME showed that out of the 51,077 units which took loans, 6,663 were classified as ‘ sick ’ on September 2019, with outstanding loans to the tune of Rs 424.2 crore.

In the quarter ending June 2019, the number of sick units in Goa stood at 949, with outstanding loans of just Rs 86.7 crore.

The data was shared with various stakeholders at the empowered committee for MSMEs convened by the Reserve Bank of India’s (RBI) financial inclusion and development department.

“The rehabilitation of sick industries in the MSME sector was discussed in detail. RBI exhorted all bankers to put in their sincere efforts to nurse these viable units back to activity,” said an industry representative.

According to the Sick Industrial Companies Act, a sick industrial unit is a company which at the end of any financial year incurs accumulated losses equal to or exceeding its entire net worth.

“There were 1,662 units considered to be potentially viable which were put under nursing, and their loans were restructured, amounting to Rs. 134.2 crore,” said a source present at the meeting.

The bank data on credit to MSMEs also showed that 8.95% of the total lending to the sector remained outstanding with the 6,663 sick units.

The RBI’s general manager for Goa, N J Nampoothiri, chaired the meeting and reviewed the status report on the performance of banks on the flow of credit in the MSME sector for the July-September 2019 quarter.

In 2011, Goa government had framed guidelines to identify, revive and rehabilitate sick industrial units, but it did not gain traction.

The number of new units serviced for the July-September quarter rose by 8.6%, from 3,822 units to 4,150 units, and the flow of credit also increased by 31.5% to Rs 179.6 crore from Rs 136.6 crore in the quarter ending June 2019.

200,['11/03/2020'],Even cancer can’t checkmate his passion for chess,"Purushottam Kantak

PANAJI: For over two decades, Purushottam Kantak never missed his daily routine: Wake up at 5am and for three hours without a break, solve problems, read books and study the game online so that he could become a better chess player and train youngsters to become champions.

But for the past 10 days, Kantak—the only Goan to win state chess championship in junior, senior and veteran categories—has slowed down a bit. He cannot wake up at the scheduled time, and even if he does, his wife Geeta, also a chess player, won’t allow him to put his body through the rigour.

Having just underwent the third surgery for cancer , his punishing schedule could prove fatal. After all, this 58-year-old has been battling the illness for seven years.

Kantak is unfazed. “Chess is like a virus. Once it enters your body, you cannot get rid of it. My personal belief is that chess helps you take your mind off everything, even personal problems,” a frail-looking Kantak told TOI at his Margao residence.

He was first diagnosed with oral cancer in 2013, got operated and was back on his feet. In 2018, he was found to have colon cancer, so another cycle of chemotherapy and recovery session started. Just when it seemed like he can breathe easy, the cancer showed up again early this year, this time weakening his fight.

What hasn’t diminished is his love for the sport and the ambition to produce a champion. It is this desire that has kept him going at his Brain Power Goa Chess Academy, where he conducts advanced coaching and helps shape the future of Goa’s next champion.

“He cannot live without chess. On the bed, while chemotherapy is in progress, he would hold a chess book and study, forgetting what he is going through. While travelling in the car (to the hospital in Panaji), he either solves chess problems or uses the magnetic chess board that he has, to play,” says Geeta.

Till three months ago, he was an active chess player too. He travelled to Dharmasthala in Karnataka where he picked up an award for the best veteran chess player. In December, he finished a creditable eighth from among 200 rated players at the All Goa Chess Championship in Margao, and more famously the same year, he finished fourth at the All Goa State Fide Rating chess tournament-cum-selection trials and was among the selected players for national championships.

“I miss playing. When you play, players (who you coach) respect you more. They say, ‘you beat me and show’. I do just that, despite all of them having the latest computers and software,” he says.

Even today, Kantak has not given up and is waiting for May when the Goa International Open Grandmaster Chess—to be named after former chief minister Manohar Parrikar—will be played here and he’ll pit his might against the best.

“Chess keeps my mind active and you can control all your diseases with your mind. There’s a new immune system in the body which you have to activate,” says Kantak, who won his first junior title in 1980 and became a state champion in 2001.

What Kantak, a lawyer by profession and grandson of Goa’s famous poet Padma Shri Bakibab Borkar, would also miss is the visits to government primary schools in the vicinity, or to the slums where he can teach chess to those who cannot afford to pay the high fees.

In the eyes of Kantak, a seven-year-old at the academy is the latest chess prodigy in Goa. He’s seen that spark and the talent. For someone who bunks school three times a week and trains at the academy, the youngster is tailor-made for success and Kantak is doing the best he can.

“Every Dronacharya dreams of having an Arjun. My dream is to find someone who will say that Kantak taught me and made me a champion. This is my only dream,” says Kantak.

201,['11/03/2020'],Mutiny reveals dangers of sidelining young turks,"New Delhi: Jyotiraditya Scindia ’s rebellion set off rumblings in Congress about many ticking bombs within, as much a result of the leadership vacuum at the top as of a ‘generational clash’ that has wrecked the party over the last year.

The loss of an important leader and a state government in the middle of an intense debate on CAA-NRC and a Parliament session can be demoralising for the opposition party. Though Jyotiraditya Scindia has been gradually drifting away from Congress, he has been seen as close to Rahul Gandhi, usually sitting next to him in the previous Lok Sabha. The failure to accommodate his ambition and, in fact, cut him out of the power equation in MP has cost Congress dearly.

As Scindia left Congress and joined arch rival BJP , murmurs were rife in Congress over many other young leaders brimming with aspiration but being set back by elders in their states. Scindia’s resignation letter where he told Sonia Gandhi that “this path has been drawing itself out over last year” made evident that his gripe was against CM Kamal Nath and Digvijaya Singh, who had joined hands to stall him.

Though unstated, the buzz that no young leader would get his due given Rahul Gandhi’s pre-eminence in the scheme of things, has only grown louder.

Kuldeep Bishnoi, Haryana MLA, tweeted that Scindia’s exit was a big loss and many other capable leaders were feeling alienated. It triggered alarm about upcoming Rajya Sabha elections in Haryana. While Congress can win a seat in the state, it has a buffer of just one MLA with one member appearing unable to vote because of health concerns, and the situation is likely to embolden the ruling BJP to make a bid for the second berth. A senior leader said the party would have to be careful about the choice of candidate as well as management of votes in Haryana.

But apart from immediate issues, the longer term problems, masked somewhat by BJP losing out in Maharashtra, post-poll, and failing to retain Jharkhand and falling short in Delhi, have been brought to the fore by Scindia’s successful revolt.

Rajasthan Congress chief and deputy chief minister Sachin Pilot has warned the leadership that nomination of a money bag to the Upper House, as is being speculated, will send a negative signal to the electorate and party cadre. Pilot is well-ensconced, where he has a stake, but leaders like him may well expect their voices to be heard more respectfully.

Scindia’s rebellion also started with attempts to thwart his bid for Rajya Sabha as also state leadership. However, the larger worry in Congress is about the leadership vacuum that has resulted from Rahul Gandhi’s refusal to take back the organisational reins in the wake of Lok Sabha poll debacle.

Scindia’s exit, said a party member, reflects that Rahul has given up or is indifferent to extreme steps by his colleagues that can set back the party. The social media was rife with claims that he refused an appointment to Scindia last week. The drift at the top is best reflected by the failure to select new leaders for state units. DK Shivakumar’s name was apparently finalised for Karnataka PCC, but has been in a limbo for over two months, due to objections of senior leaders. The leadership for Maharashtra and Mumbai units is also up for grabs.

As reported by TOI, a group of young leaders have been discussing among themselves about the threat that continuing vacuum at the top poses to state units, and are planning to speak out sometime in future.

202,['11/03/2020'],Holi amidst coronavirus,"Panaji: Brightly-coloured powders and water balloons were launched by revellers celebrating the festival of colours at Azad Maidan, Panaji on Tuesday, amidst fears of the coronavirus. Goa, so far, has not tested a single positive case, and this seems to have motivated people to take to the streets to celebrate Holi. However, many of the celebrators were non-Panjimites with most of the city’s residents choosing to opt out of the festival this year.

“Every year, we see a crowd of over 2,000 people, but this year there were only 1,000. People were cautious and many Panjimites stayed away. Migrants and people from beyond city limits showed up and participated,” festival organiser Shantaram Naik said.

Announcements were being made at the venue informing attendees to leave the festival if they have a cough or cold. Some volunteers even kindly escorted people who were seen sneezing, out of the premises.

“We were aware that there would be lukewarm response to the festival since there were fears about the spread of coronavirus. People who regularly come for this festival may not have turned up with their families, but the celebrations overall took place devoid of any fears,” advocate Gunwant Juneja, resident of Panaji for 35 years, said.

“The crowd was smaller this year, and those that did participate did so owing to their attachment to the tradition of celebrating Holi at Azad Maidan. My children Prithvi and Poorwa, especially wanted to come and enjoy this festival since this is how we celebrate it as a family annually,” Pramod Naik Sardesai said.

There were volunteers at all entrances to inform people that they must not enter if they are not healthy.

Besides locals, volunteers were keeping foreigners informed as well.

“There were about 25-30 foreigners who were enjoying the event. They were not forbidden entry into the festival. But the organisers made announcements about the dos and dont’s to avoid the virus infection,” another regular attendee Parwinder Singh said.

203,['11/03/2020'],Ensure purchases for ESI adhere to GMP: Jaganmohan Reddy,"ViJAYAWADA: Chief minister YS Jaganmohan Reddy said that the Andhra Pradesh government would strictly adhere to Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) rules to ensure that products purchased by the Employee’s State Insurance (ESI) are consistently produced and controlled according, per quality standards.

Reviewing workers’ welfare and healthcare here on Tuesday, the CM said that there should be no room for anomalies in the purchase of medicines for the workforce.

It may be recalled that irregularities in the purchase of medicines and medical equipment for ESI hospitals during the TDP regime were exposed. The vigilance and enforcement department has unearthed an ESI medicine scam worth over Rs 400 crore in the state.

“All standards for the implementation of health services should be strictly followed,” Jagan said, adding that ESI should release bills on the spot. He sought proposals for the improvement of services in ESI hospitals and directed officials to make sure that hospitals function smoothly.

As it was already decided to increase the number of teaching hospitals to 27 from the existing 11, thereby ensuring that each parliamentary constituency has a teaching hospital and a nursing college, the services of the new doctors from these colleges should be utilised in ESI hospitals, the CM added.

Jagan also said that concerted efforts should be made to curb pollution in the state. He said pollution at sea was leading to severe environmental degradation.

Efforts should be made to fill all the vacancies in the labour department, Jagan said, adding that he would write a letter to the Prime Minister about the pending LIC claims to the workers.

I didn’t expect this to happen. I would have never made the mistake of leaving the country so soon had I known,” he told TOI.“Police clearance is done, and our visas are ready too. The company is only waiting for our medicals. Now I’m afraid I’ll lose my job. If the suspension continues, they may just decide to leave us out and hire locals instead. I hope this doesn’t happen,” he said, adding that his visa and work permit have both been cancelled.Goans in Qatar have also had to shelve their plans to visit the state, some for business and others to be reunited with their families.A mother of two working in Qatar who was set to spend time with her husband and two children in Mapusa next week has decided not to take the risk of getting stuck in Goa and losing her job.“I broke the news to the children. They can’t express their feelings, but you can tell from their faces.

205,['11/03/2020'],Jyotiraditya Scindia: Congress failed to gauge Scindia’s loyal following,"New Delhi: Driven by the ruling faction in Bhopal, led by CM Kamal Nath and Digvijaya Singh, Congress utterly failed to gauge the support commanded by Jyotiraditya Scindia and the resentment among its MLAs, a miss that is set to bring down the 15-month-old Congress-led government in MP .

Though Scindia had adopted a rebellious tone over the last couple of months, the state Congress was convinced that he would not be able to garner support of more than five MLAs, that too from his turf of Gwalior-Guna. That prompted Nath and Singh to push Scindia to go for the broke, an extreme step that he may not have taken in normal circumstances.

The calculation was that even if he left the party, he would not be able to bring down the government and the loss of a few MLAs would be compensated by the turncoats from BJP who were in contact with the chief minister. What actually transpired — with over 20 MLAs set to quit Congress now along with Scindia and join BJP — has shocked the state unit.

There was also complete confidence in the Congress brass, starting from the AICC, that Scindia could grumble and create problems but would not jump the ship for arch rival BJP.

That Scindia could muster support beyond his recognised clout — and also decide to join BJP — left Congress red-faced with embarrassment on Holi.

The problems started right after the Congress victory in the December 2018 elections. Scindia was overlooked as choice of party mascot for the state polls, as Digvijaya Singh threw his lot behind Nath in the deeply factionalised state unit.

While Scindia was smarting all along, his defeat in 2019 Lok Sabha elections made him desperate. He staked claim to a Rajya Sabha berth and state leadership.

But the Nath-Singh combine shut him out completely and the disappearance of some party MLAs last week was seen as a bid to thwart his claim for the RS berth. The proposal that Priyanka Gandhi Vadra become an RS candidate from the state was also seen as the ruling group’s bid to cut out Scindia.

The absentee leadership at the top, following Rahul Gandhi’s resignation as Congress chief, only helped the state satraps get a free run without having to worry about the diktats or concerns of the AICC.

For the young leader, this was a recap, and extension, of the rivalry that these senior leaders had with his late father Madhavrao Scindia, which thwarted the latter from becoming the CM. His complete shutting out drove him to the extreme step of quitting Congress and joining the BJP.

The episode has an echo of what Jyotiraditya’s late father did in 1996. After his name figured in the infamous Jain Hawala diaries during the Narasimha Rao government, in which he was a minister, he was denied a ticket for Lok Sabha elections.

Miffed, Scindia senior left Congress and contested under his newly floated party and defeated the official Congress candidate. He went on to support the Deve Gowda government but returned to Congress in 1998 when Sonia Gandhi assumed leadership. He remained in Congress till his death in an air crash in 2001.

NEW DELHI: Earlier arrested in connection with the murder of four people in northeast Delhi , Lokesh Kumar Solanki allegedly told the police that during the riots, he had joined a mob that was on an attacking spree. He alleged that his friend, Pankaj, was also with him when four people were killed and their bodies were dumped in a drain. Pankaj was arrested on Tuesday.

Three others who were throwing petrol bombs from the terrace of suspended AAP councillor Tahir Hussain have also been arrested. “Solanki and Pankaj joined the mob and with help from others, killed four people and dumped their bodies in the drain. They don’t have a criminal record. They were not working anywhere at present.” said an officer privy to the investigation.

On March 5, four cases of rioting that had happened in northeast Delhi on February 24 were transferred to the Crime Branch. They were registered under sections of rioting, murder and destruction of evidence. During manual and technical investigation, it was found that a group of people was involved in these incidents. Solanki was arrested on the basis of evidence collected.

Police also arrested three aides of suspended AAP councillor Tahir Hussain for indulging in violence from the terrace of Hussain’s house. Police said they have been identified as Irshad, Abid and Shadab. During the riots, they were also allegedly throwing petrol bombs from the terrace.

VIJAYAWADA: As part of the Nadu-Nedu programme, a target of modernising 15,715 schools was set, apart from the digitalisation of education with the introduction of English as the medium of instruction from Class 1 to Class 6 from the next academic year.

Chief minister YS Jaganmohan Reddy , at a review meeting with officials on Tuesday, directed officials to complete the modernisation works of schools by the beginning of the academic year by June.

“Regarding the introduction of English as the medium of instruction at the primary school level from June, every school must be given a smart TV for digitalised learning,” chief minister Jaganmohan Reddy said. He also added that the quality of items being offered as part of Jagannanna Vidya Kanuka programme should be maintained at the highest level.

Officials displayed the uniforms, belts, bags, notebooks, textbooks, shoes and socks that would be given to students.

When the chief minister asked about the implementation of the Jagannanna Gorumudda mid-day meal programme and the maintenance of toilets in schools, the officials informed him that they were regularly monitoring that through the app introduced for the programmes and that water tankers were being arranged for the schools which do not have water facility.

Deputy mayor Pascoela Mascarenhas, however, will not continue for another term as Monserrate has selected Vasant Agshikar for the post. Agshikar represents ward 25.

Madkaikar and Agshikar will file their nominations on Tuesday. Madkaikar has been representing Bhatulem ward for many years. Elections are scheduled to be held on Thursday. As per the Corporation of the City of Panaji Act, the mayor and deputy mayor are to be elected every year. Last year, Monserrate did not continue with Vithal Chopdekar as mayor and brought in Madkaikar. The last CCP election was held in March 2016 when the panel backed by Monserrate wrested control of the corporation in a bitter tussle with the BJP-supported panel. The Congress-backed panel had fielded 20 candidates

In the 30-member corporation, Monserrate’s panel had won 17 seats while BJP had to be content with 13. Sidharth Kuncalienker was the Panaji MLA at the time as Manohar Parrikar was the Union minister for defence. The result was considered a big setback to the BJP as the party was ruling both at the Centre and in the state.

In July 2019, Monserrate along with nine other Congress MLAs joined the BJP. Two months earlier, he had trounced Kuncalienker in the assembly bypolls after Parrikar’s demise in March last year. Monserrate does not have any opposition panel to contest against after he joined the BJP last year.

BHOPAL: With the Kamal Nath government teetering on the edge, the mood was grim but combative at the Congress legislative party meeting at chief minister Kamal Nath’s residence.

Sources said Nath has said they will fight on, and dare BJP to a floor test. Former PR minister P C Sharma claimed the resignations are fake. “Don’t worry. Picture abhi baki hai,” he said. According to sources, former minister Sajjan Singh Verma is flying to Bengaluru on Tuesday night.

Sources said 94 party MLAs and four Independents attended the meeting along with Rajya Sabha MP Digvijaya Singh. Discussions went on for more than two and half hours.

After the meeting, deputy Speaker Heena Kavre said, “We have been asked to stay united and fight together. The situation may be adverse but no one should have any fear. A senior party leader has betrayed us.”

Asked about Jyotiraditya Scindia , she said, “Jyotiraditya Scindia will not be discussed in Congress meetings any more. There was no talk about Scindia. He has been expelled from primary leadership of the party.” Outside the chief minister’s residence, emotions ran high. Congress workers shouted slogans in favour of Nath and against Scindia. At the party HQ, some of them ripped out Scindia’s nameplate and crushed it underfoot.

MLA from Kala Peepal constituency and state Youth Congress president Kunal Choudhary said Scindia has “betrayed every Congress worker who fought for Congress during 15 years of BJP rule”.

Congress leaders kept up a fighting front. “We will prove our majority on the floor of the House. All these resignations, the MLAs were told, is to pressurise for Rajya Sabha nomination,” said state Congress media department chairperson Shobha Oza after the CLP meeting.

211,['11/03/2020'],"Draft feni policy lacks true spirit, fails to give stakeholders a kick","PANAJI: After three years of deliberations, the state government’s draft feni policy is finally ready, but it doesn’t seem to have aged well. The draft, prepared by Goa University for the government, was roundly criticised by stakeholders, who said that it lacks the true spirit required to take feni forward and make it a competitive drink.

“It can’t be accepted. We want it to be reworked,” said Hansel Vaz, secretary of the Goa cashew feni manufacturers and bottlers association. Vaz, who runs the premium feni brand Cazulo, said that the association is “disappointed” with the draft, which is silent on various aspects that are of paramount important for distillers.

The stakeholders got especially irked by the fact that the draft policy, prepared by GU ’s Goa Business School, doesn’t focus on or highlight better agricultural practices for cashew farmers to enable their cashew apples yields. To their dismay, it talks about cashew nuts.

One stakeholder said that it should have focused on the cashew apples. “Cashew nuts are not the source of feni,” he said.

The draft policy states that 42 varieties of cashews are grown in Goa, and recommends Goa-1, Vengurla-1, Vengurla-4, Vengurla-6, Vengurla-7, Vengurla –8 as high-yielding varieties to be cultivated by farmers. The series of Vengurla varieties developed by the Indian Council for Agricultural Research (ICAR) at Ela Farms, Old Goa, have wide adaptability and good nut size.

“Vengurla variety is the worst when it comes to cashew apples. Why aren’t they talking about indigenous varieties,” a stakeholder said, adding that farmers needed to be guided in choosing which variety is the best in terms of cashew apples.

“They (researchers) have collected data without scrutinising, analysing or even verifying the same,” said another stakeholder, who feels that the draft document contains “no policy material”.

One stakeholder said that the draft mentions processes involved, but it shies away from clearly showing directions to distillers, who are facing challenging times. “Who wants to know that cashew juice is extracted by stomping cashew apples, a primary process involved in distilling?” he asked.

“Traditionally, copper vessels were used for distilling, and earthen pots for fermenting cashew juice,” he said. “Today, big copper vessels are not available and it is difficult to procure large earthen pots. Many traders have replaced copper vessels with steel. Juice is fermented in plastic drums. This modification is not in sync with the original method of distilling.”

What could be the alternative? The draft is mum on this. Feni experts say that it is meaningless as it doesn’t addrress basic questions as these, which are paramount to securing and standardising the age-old practice of distilling feni.

When pointed out that stakeholders were unhappy with the draft, excise commissioner Amit Satija said that it was prepared “in consultation with all stakeholders involved from time to time”.

Satija said the policy aims at setting standards for distilling that distillers need to follow. Those confirming with set standards will be issued certification or labelling. This, he said, “will weed out operators who do not conform to quality and hygiene”.

213,['11/03/2020'],3 held for bid to extort Rs5cr from jeweller in Pune,"Representative image

PUNE: The crime branch on Tuesday arrested three persons for their alleged attempt to extort Rs5 crore from the owner of a city-based jeweller.

The police identified the arrested trio as Ashish Pawar (27), Ramesh Pawar (32) and Rupesh Chaudhary (45). The police said they had demanded the money after threatening the jeweller (name withheld) that they would make a video clip of his family member viral on the social media.

Ashish, who hails from Sahakarnagar, had earlier worked with the jeweller as the latter’s bodyguard. Ramesh is a resident of Market Yard and was working as a house helper at the jeweller’s bungalow. The police said Rupesh, a resident of Tulshibagwale colony in Sahakarnagar, was a small-time developer.

The police will produce them before a magisterial court on Wednesday for securing their custodial remand.

Deputy commissioner of police (crime) Bachchan Singh told TOI, “We are further investigating the case with regards to the motive, modus operandi and also to find out if any more accomplices are involved in the crime.”

When contacted, the jeweller, who did not wish to be named, told TOI, “This all started on Saturday afternoon after one of our house helpers called me and asked for a ransom of Rs5 crore. He claimed to have some video of our family, which later turned out that he had nothing. He was helped by two of his colleagues from outside. We took help of the police and all three of them were nabbed quickly by Tuesday evening.""

Crime branch senior inspector Rajendra Mohite said, “After getting the first extortion demand for Rs50 crore on March 4, the jeweller initially tried to negotiate with the suspects to settle for a lesser amount. He even offered them gold worth Rs1.5 crore. But the suspects would settle for nothing less than Rs5 crore. The jeweller then decided to approach us and submitted a complaint application on Monday night, naming the three suspects. On verifying the contents of his plea, we got an FIR registered on Tuesday. The three suspects were arrested from their residences.”

Mohite said, “The jeweller said in the complaint application that Ramesh was the first to call him and claimed that he had secured a video clip of his (jeweller’s) family member. Ramesh asked for money for not making the same viral on social media. The plea further stated that Ramesh and his two accomplices individually met the jeweller at various places on March 7 and 8 for negotiating an amount to settle the matter. The jeweller then sought time till Tuesday to consider their demand.”

Another crime branch officer, who did not wish to be named, told TOI that during negotiations, Ashish had twice threatened the jeweller with a licenced pistol belonging to Rupesh. He said, “We will now go for the recovery of the firearm as well as the video clip claimed by Ramesh.”

An offence of extortion and provisions under the Information Technology Act has been registered.

214,['11/03/2020'],Remove recovery hoardings: HC to UP govt,"Prayagraj: The Allahabad high court on Monday ordered the UP government to immediately remove hoardings carrying names, addresses and photographs of 57 people, allegedly anti-CAA protesters , against whom recovery notices had earlier been served for allegedly damaging private and public properties.

It called the government’s action an “unwarranted interference in the privacy of people” and said “the placement of personal data of selected persons reflects colorable exercise of powers by the executive”. While admitting that the state can always take necessary steps to ensure law and order, the HC said, “But that cannot be by violating fundamental rights of people.”

“It is in violation of Article 21 of the Constitution, which clearly provides that no person shall be deprived of his life and personal liberty except according to procedure established by law,” the high court said.

Rejecting the government’s contention that the hoardings were aimed at deterring people from participating in illegal activities, a division bench of Chief Justice Govind Mathur and Justice Ramesh Sinha said, “The advocate general has failed to satisfy us as to why personal data of a few persons has been placed on banners when there are lakhs of accused persons who are facing serious allegations pertaining to the commission of crimes whose personal details have not been subjected to publicity.”

It directed the state government not to place on the roadside such banners containing personal data of individuals without the authority of law. “Under the CrPC, the power is available to a court to publish a written proclamation requiring the appearance of a person against whom a warrant has been issued and such person is concealing himself to avoid execution of a warrant. No other power is available in the code to police or the executive to display personal records of a person to public at large,” it said.

“So far as legality part is concerned, suffice to state that no law is in existence permitting the state to place banners with personal data of the accused from whom compensation is to be charged,” the court added.

While justifying its decision to take suo motu cognizance of the matter, the court observed, “Where there is gross negligence on the part of public authorities and government, where the law is disobeyed and the public is put to suffering and where the precious values of the constitution are subjected to injuries, a constitutional court can very well take notice of that on its own. The court in such matters is not required to wait for a person to come before it to ring the bell of justice. Courts are meant to impart justice and no court can shut its eyes if a public unjust is happening just before it.”

The Lucknow divisional commissioner and district magistrate were asked to execute the order and file a compliance report in court by March 16. On Saturday, the high court had taken suo motu cognizance of the hoardings put up on Thursday night by the Lucknow district administration.

As per rules, all recruiting agencies should take Pravasi Bharatiya Bima Yojana (PBBY) for all labourers they send abroad for work. However, this was not followed in the case of Kokeni Posanna (38). His wife Kokeni Gangajala said the agency cheated them by not subscribing to the rules and by not opting for insurance on her husband’s name.

In a letter to Jagtial district collector, Gangajala said the agency collected Rs 65,000 from them towards service charges. Two persons running the agency sent Posanna on a visit visa to Dubai in June 2018 but allegedly skipped the eMigrate system and did not provide for PBBY as promised. Posanna hails from Jaina village in Dharmapuri mandal. He returned to the state on January 13 this year after suffering a stroke paralysis. He has been stuck to the bed ever since.

Posanna would have been eligible to get Rs 10 lakh under PBBY had the insurance been taken on his name by the recruiting agency. The scheme provides for Rs 10 lakh in case of death or permanent disability.

PUNE: Customs officials arrested two persons at the airport on Sunday for attempting to smuggle foreign currency of different countries, worth more than Rs 38.71 lakh, to Dubai by concealing it in the inner waistline of their trousers.

“British pounds, Qatar and Saudi riyals were recovered during a body search and thorough screening of the check-in luggage of 43-year-old Ansari Feroze Abdul Hamid and Sheikh Mohammed Tarique Iqbal Ahmed (33). Both these passengers were slated to fly from Pune to Dubai on a SpiceJet flight (SG51),” a senior customs official told TOI.

Ansari is a resident of Guruwar Peth in Pune while Sheikh is a resident of Kasba Peth .

“They had concealed the currency in a clever way. They undid the stitches on the inner waistline of their trousers and stitched it back to perfection after concealing the currency there. Currency had been hidden in other parts of their trousers in the same manner. They are surely wilful carriers. While investigations are underway, we are trying to find out how they came across the foreign currency. We are trying ascertain who the person or persons were, with whom they were in contact with. The reason behind them attempting to take the currency to Dubai, is also being probed,” the official added.

“The customs officials at the airport have been on full alert to foil attempts of gold-smuggling and regarding the Covid-19 outbreak. Checks on foreign travellers have become more stringent than ever. The officials found the duo’s behaviour to be suspicious and a proper search led to the recovery of the currency,” the official pointed out, adding that the entire operation was carried out under the guidance of Motilal Shete , the deputy commissioner of customs.

“Further investigations as per the Customs Act 1962 is in progress. Passengers are appealed to report to customs if they spot any suspicious persons or baggage at the airport,” the official said.

The customs officials arrested two persons for trying to smuggle out Rs35.41 lakh in foreign currency to Dubai from the Pune airport, in July last year. This incident occurred just over a fortnight after the customs officials recovered foreign currency worth Rs38.5 lakh from a passenger in a similar catch where the flyer was on his way to Dubai on an Air India flight. On August 8, 2017, two persons were arrested after they were found carrying foreign currency worth Rs1.29 crore in the form of Euros and US Dollars in four casseroles filled with upma, a Maharashtrian snack.

219,['11/03/2020'],"Arrests of Bread, Butter and Egg lead to drugs-money laundering racket","(From left) Butter Nnamani, Eze Naduka Bonaventure — also called Egg — and Kelvin Mansary, called Bread

NEW DELHI: While trailing members of a methamphetamine cartel , Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) has stumbled upon a nexus among jailed criminals , bank officials and drug traffickers who were allegedly running a major money laundering racket .

The gang was apparently in possession of a list of dormant accounts in which several crores had been parked by unknown entities. It was planning to transfer the money to accounts owned by them and their shell firms, police said.

The revelations were made after three drug traffickers codenamed Bread, Butter and Egg arrested with a consignment of meth, cocaine and heroin worth over Rs 5 crore. They have also led NCB to their aides one of whom works with a private bank branch in Karnal while another, Vishal, is lodged in Tihar jail. The NCB has now written to Enforcement Directorate to probe the money laundering angle.

The arrested men have been identified as Butter Nnamani (35), Eze Naduka Bonaventure (36) and Kelvin Mansary (30) who belong to Nigeria. While Bonaventure was fondly addressed as Egg by his associates, Mansary was referred to as Bread or Ben. Nnamani was living in Khirki extension, while Bonaventure in Chhatarpur and Mansary in Gurugram. The alleged mastermind is a US citizen named Robert Planco.

DG NCB Rakesh Asthana had formed a special team to probe the money laundering aspect of drug trafficking given the high value of drugs seized in the last one year. “The suspicious transaction record originating from international accounts was a matter of enquiry with NCB. While working on this information, a reliable input was received regarding an international syndicate which was tipped to be involved in drug trafficking as well as money laundering,” deputy DG, RN Srivastav, said.

“A raid was conducted and the three traffickers were arrested with 255 gram cocaine, 350 gm heroin and 100 gm Methamphetamine. Forensic examination of their technical gadgets shed light on the other characters involved in the racket,” said K P S Malhotra, zonal director of the agency.

Further probe led the cops to the bank official codenamed Ice, Vishal and Polanco. Ice, who is a cocaine addict, came in touch with the gang during a drug deal with Mansary.

“As per their plan, they wanted to transfer the money from the dormant accounts to various new accounts. Polanco came to India in January and discussed the plan with others. He also met Ice at a hotel in Gurugram and paid him Rs 10 lakh as advance for helping them transfer the money,” zonal director Malhotra added.

Ice allegedly promised to arrange the necessary clearances and approvals for transactions. Vishal was arranging the necessary documents and logistics.

The standing committee on urban development has recommended the agencies concerned to begin biomining at the site to reduce the waste. Bio-mining is a technique of extraction and segregation of minerals and useful material from mounds of waste. This can be used to extract materials like plastic, rubber, metals and gases.

East Delhi Municipal Corporation ( EDMC ) had informed the committee that efforts were being made to remediate the Ghazipur landfill site on line of Indore Municipal Corporation. But the legacy (old) waste at Indore was only 13 lakh tonnes whereas at Ghazipur it is over 140 lakh tonnes.

In its report, the panel said: “The committee from the post evidence reply finds that as desired by them a visit of commissioner, EDMC, joint secretary in-charge of SBM (U) in MoH&UA along with local MP took place and it was agreed to continue bio-mining of landfill site and use of output for RDF and construction and demolition plants with NHAI agreeing to take initial 5,000 tonnes of soil for road construction. The committee recommend that work be started expeditiously on the pattern of Indore.”

The panel headed by BJP MP Jagdambika Pal also took note of a survey which had highlighted how as high as 80% of public toilets in East Delhi were unusable for want of proper maintenance. “In view of ground reality, the committee does not subscribe to the views of the EDMC and recommends that all-out efforts be made on the part of MoH&UA under sanitation component for required level of maintenance in the affected area,” it said.

The panel also found that out of Rs 5,026 crore worth of funds released for solid waste management in urban areas, barely Rs 3,470 crore were used. It also criticised lower utilisation of funds under Atal Mission and Rejuvenation of Urban Transport scheme, which focusses on water supply and sewage connections.

It also flagged the slow pace of work done on the implementation of reform agenda like replacement of energy efficient lights. The report said that 74 lakh such lights were installed, which is less than the target of 100 lakh.

PUNE: A team of four mountaineers from the city-based mountaineering club Giripremi will leave from Kathmandu on March 14 to climb Mt Annapurna I — the world’s 10th highest peak.

The flag-off ceremony for the same was held recently at Nehru Auditorium, Ghole Road. Brigadier Suneel Limaye, (VSM) Group Commander NCC, Pune Division, was the chief guest. The team was handed over the Indian tricolour during the ceremony. The team will hoist the tricolour atop the peak following the successful completion of the expedition.

“Mt Annapurna I stands tall at a height of 8,091 meters and is known as one of the toughest to scale across the globe in the 8,000er cluster. The difficulty level is because of the peculiar conditions at the elevation of 8,000m. Since there is very little oxygen at that level and the temperature could drop to -60 degrees celsius at the peak, the mountain is a difficult one to scale, ” director of Guadian Giripremi Institute of Mountaineering Umesh Zirpe told TOI.

“The team is expecting to summit between April 20 and 25. This is the period with ideal weather conditions with lowered wind speed,” Zirpe added.

NEW DELHI: By next week , the mercury may touch the 30 degree-Celsius mark in the national capital.

“Impact of the western disturbance, which hit Delhi-NCR on March 10, is expected to remain till March 14. From March 15 onwards, the temperature will start rising. We are expecting it to touch 30 degrees by March 18,” said Kuldeep Srivastava, a senior scientist at India Meteorological Department.

“The maximum temperature touches the 30-degree mark around March 17-18 every year,” he added.

“Till March 15, the maximum temperature will remain around 26-27 degrees Celsius, while the minimum will be around 14-15 degrees. Some rain is expected in the city, while some places in NCR might experience hailstorm. On Wednesday evening, Jind witnessed hailstorm, while rain was recorded in parts of Haryana,” Srivastava said.

While Safdurjung recorded 1mm rain till 8.30am on Wednesday, Palam witnessed 0.6mm rain. Among other stations, Ayanagar recorded 1.4mm, Lodhi Road 0.7mm and Ridge saw 0.6mm rain.

The maximum temperature on Wednesday was 27.4 degrees Celsius, two notches below normal, while the minimum was 14.8, one degree Celsius above normal.

On Thursday, partly cloudy sky is expected with very light rain or drizzle towards the night. The maximum and minimum temperatures would be around 28 and 15 degrees Celsius, respectively.

In terms of pollution levels, it was a “moderate” day in the city as the air quality index (AQI) touched 116. An AQI between 101 and 200 is considered moderate on the Central Pollution Control Board’s index.

Delhi-NCR’s average PM2.5 levels were recorded at 54.5 micrograms per cubic metre at 7pm on Wednesday, which was within the safe standards. The average PM10 levels were recorded at 113.4 micrograms per cubic metre, just outside the safe standards. The “emergency” benchmark for these pollutants under GRAP is, respectively, 300 and 500 micrograms per cubic metre, while the safe standards are 60 and 100 micrograms per cubic metre.

High wind speed and fairly widespread rainfall is likely to push AQI into the satisfactory or the good category on Thursday.

224,['11/03/2020'],Pune: Engineering colleges look to shift focus to IT streams,"Representative image

PUNE: About 21 engineering colleges in Pune division have applied to the Directorate of Technical Education, either for the closure of a division entirely or to transfer the intake of one course into another.

In most cases, DTE officials said, the colleges have asked for transferring a portion of their intake in the mechanical department to the computer science or IT department.

A lack of placement offers in the mechanical department is the main reason for fewer students applying for that programme, which results in colleges wanting to close down that department, said officials.

“The number of students taking up engineering is coming down, and even among the various courses being offered, students want only computer (science) and IT and, to some extent, electronics. Further, due to a slump in the automobile sector and other such core areas, the recruitment process in the mechanical department is also down,” C Kunjir, assistant technical director, said.

But the statement that there are no jobs for mechanical students is also not completely true, say placement officers — while there is a demand-supply gap, it is the comparison with pay packages offered by IT companies that affects them.

“If an IT company recruits 30-35k freshers per year, the mechanical vertical of the same group will have a requirement of just 200-250 freshers a year. Hence, the supply is higher as compared to demand,” said Shitalkumar Rawandale , training & placements officer, Pimpri Chinchwad College of Engineering .

“There are jobs available for mechanical students in industrial zones, in small and medium industries, but students nowadays don’t want to work in these places, especially when they see their counterparts in IT working for higher salaries in much better offices,” Rawandale added.

Optimization of resources is also another reason for colleges to shut such divisions, or at least cut down their intake. “Infrastructure required for mechanical students is larger than that for computer science or IT. Secondly, mechanical engineering being an older branch, most colleges have an intake of 60-120. But if only 10 or fewer students apply, private colleges lose out proportionally on fees. The longer the seats lie vacant, the higher the losses, leading to teachers being paid less. This has a detrimental effect on quality and placements,” said an official in the field.

The car, valued at Rs14 lakh, was later seized by the Pune police crime branch.

The man received a telephone call from the Pune police crime branch on March 27, 2019, to take the vehicle to the station for inspection. “We had our suspicions that he had purchased a stolen vehicle,” police said.

Police said the businessman later brought the vehicle to the crime branch in the presence of the car dealers on April 1. “An inspection revealed that the vehicle was stolen. The car dealers repaid Rs4 lakh to the businessman and sought time to pay the balance of Rs10.91 lakh,” an officer said.

After the car dealers failed to repay the money, the businessman lodged an FIR against them on Monday and accused them of cheating him, a Kondhwa police officer said.

Police said the businessman, dealing in footwear, contacted the car dealers through a friend. He had selected the SUV and struck a deal with the suspects after getting the vehicle checked from an automobile showroom.

The businessman made the payment in instalments after the vehicle was transferred to his name, the police officer said.

Along with the spread of the nCoV across the world, thousands have been infected with the other common viruses that have symptoms, which are worryingly similar to the one that has taken more than 3,500 lives over the last one month. But doctors maintained that these viruses are far more innocuous since they are not easily transmitted like nCoV, though they recommend caution and immediate medical action.Adeno virus, rhinovirus, influenza virus and non-novel coronaviruses are on the prowl in Kolkata, warned experts. These viruses routinely strike at this time of the year when temperatures fluctuate, leading to the onset of summer, they added. “They trigger a bout of cough and cold, body ache and, sometimes, fever. But the difference this time is the fear of nCoV, which has led to a big concern among people. So far, however, no one from Kolkata has been diagnosed with Covid-19. But it is better to stay at home in case your symptoms are severe,” pulmonologist at Fortis Hospital Raja Dhar said.Most patients have contracted dry cough this time. The cough has worsened in many patients, leading to body ache and fever, said internal medicine specialist Rahul Jain. “We are being forced to seek every such patient’s travel history to rule out the possibility nCoV. So far, I haven’t come across a suspect, but it’s now mandatory since every patient can’t possibly be tested for nCoV. We are also advising patients to make sure that they don’t get close to people who have travelled from the affected countries, at least for some time,” Jain said.The common viruses will now thrive and spread as the weather is ideal for their survival, pointed out RTIICS consultant Arindam Biswas. It’s getting warm but the maximum temperature has continued to hover around 30°C, which isn’t enough to kill the viruses, he pointed out. “But what makes these viruses less harmful is that they don’t get transmitted as easily or as fast as the nCoV,” Biswas said. He added that nothing has changed about the seasonal viruses other than the fact that they are leading to a scare. “Even though many are insisting on an nCoV test or hospitalization, it is the elderly who are at some risk. Due to their low immunity and comorbidities — like diabetes, renal failure, asthma and cardiac ailments — they are more susceptible to infections,” Biswas added.There is little to distinguish between nCoV and the rest, though, said experts. “Symptoms are identical and the incubation periods are long. Most nCoV as well as non-nCoV patients remain symptomless for several days. The only difference could be a runny nose and more pronounced upper respiratory tract infection,” said Jain.Once the mercury climbs, the viruses could die out, said Jain. “While there is no specific temperature, at which circulating viruses die, respiratory viruses generally die when the mercury climbs. So, we can expect the viral outbreak to end once it gets a little warmer,” he said.",kolkata,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74568664,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-117710,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/non-ncov-outbreak-adds-to-med-concerns/articleshow/74567757.cms

A quarrel over a money transaction has been prima facie established as the cause of the murder.

Kondhwa police inspector (crime) Mahadeo Kumbhar told TOI, “We have recorded the initial statement of an eyewitness (name withheld), who saw the three men pushing victim Sagar Chilaveri into the duct from the passage of their 11th floor flat. We will record the eyewitness’ statement before a magistrate under Section 164 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.”

Pintoo Kumar, one of the two security guards on duty at the Kul Utsav society, where the incident occurred, told TOI that they had seen the students running away from the parking gate at the rear of the premises moments after the victim had fallen to the ground floor.

Senior inspector Vinayak Gaikwad of the Kondhwa police told TOI, “An hour-and-half later, the three suspects — Abhinav Jadhav (23), Akshay Gorde (22) and Tejas Gujar (20) — reported themselves to the Khadi Machine police chowky and admitted to their involvement in the crime. We have arrested them for offences under sections 302 (murder), 323 (assault) and 506 (criminal intimidation), among other charges, of the Indian Penal Code.”

Omkar Chandrakant Yenpure, a security guard of the Pune Municipal Corporation ’s godown adjacent to the Kul Utsav society, had witnessed the suspects assaulting the victim and registered an FIR in this connection.

The police said Sagar and the three suspects were staying together in an 11th floor flat in the ‘C’ wing building of the society. He came in contact with the three through a friend, who was also staying in the same room.

Sagar, a school dropout, was from Solapur district. After his parents’ death, he had shifted to Pune a few years ago in search of a livelihood. One of his two sisters, who stays in Pune, told the police that he recently left his work at a bakery and was working with a friend on event management jobs.

The police said Abhinav, who is from Pathoda in Beed district, is a final-year civil engineering student. Akshay is from Shegaon in Ahmednagar district and is a third-year mechanical engineering student. Tejas is from Shivajinagar in Beed city and is a first-year civil engineering student. All are enrolled with an engineering college in Kondhwa. “They are from families with farming backgrounds,” police inspector Kumbhar said.

Preliminary investigation revealed that Sagar had taken a loan of Rs15,000 at 10% per annum interest from Abhinav in January and was unable to repay the amount on time. Abhinav had been pursuing him for the money and had called Sagar on the phone late on Monday night to ask about his whereabouts.

When Sagar told him that he was at Swargate, Abhinav and the two others drove there triple seat on a bike. They forced Sagar to accompany them back to the society on the same bike, the police said.

Complainant Yenpure said in the FIR that he and the society’s guard, Pintoo Kumar, were having a chat near the main gate when the four arrived on a bike around 1.45am. Soon, the three students started punching Sagar with bare hands and he cried for help, the FIR stated.

The three then took Sagar to the parking area of the “C” wing building and again assaulted him there, Yenpure said. When he tried to stop them and asked why they were beating up the man, Yenpure said Abhinav told him that it was their personal matter and that Sagar was not returning his money.

The FIR stated that the three suspects took Sagar to their 11th floor room, where another young man was already there. They again assaulted the victim. Yenpure and the society’s other guard, Akash Devkar, who had followed them to the 11th floor, intervened and brought Abhinav, Akshay, Tejas and Sagar back to the main gate, the FIR added. Here too, Akshay slapped Sagar when he repeatedly told the three that he would return the money on Wednesday, the FIR added.

Yenpure, Pintoo and Devkar convinced the trio not to beat up the man. As the matter appeared to be sorted out, they advised Sagar to stay with them as the latter was reluctant to go back to their room, the FIR stated. Abhinav and the two others assured the guards that they would not beat up Sagar anymore and forced him to accompany them back to their room, the FIR added.

Yenpure and Pintoo then stayed back near the main gate and Devkar proceeded towards the “C” building. Around 2.45am, Devkar came running towards Yenpure and Pintoo and told them that the three students have thrown Sagar from the 11th floor passage, the FIR stated. Soon, the three guards rushed to the spot where Sagar was found lying motionless and profusely bleeding. They immediately alerted the police.

An advance postmortem report stated that Sagar died of multiple injuries, police said.

231,['11/03/2020'],3 children norm may upset many electoral calculations,"Amaravati: With the ‘three children norm’ being followed strictly in the elections to local bodies, candidates have started digging into the antecedents of their rivals. As per rules, any person with three children or more is ineligible to contest municipal polls as also elections to the posts of sarpanch, MPTC and ZPTC.

However, a few power hunger leaders have in the past managed to work around the rule and enter the fray. Candidates, this time round, are busy ensuring that their ineligible rivals don’t find their way in.

The three children norm, however, does not stand if the third child of the aspirant concerned was born before 1995. Taking advantage of this clause, a few leaders have produced fake birth certificates for their children and contest polls.

Yalavarthi Srinivasa Rao, who served as municipal chairman of Gudivada in Krishna district between 2014 and 2019, was called out for having three children, after which an official enquiry confirmed he was indeed ineligible to continue as councilor and chairperson.

When the TDP government made an attempt to disqualify Srinivasa Rao, a close confident of local legislator Kodali Nani (now minister), he swiftly moved to TDP in 2016 and was spared the axe.

Since removing elected leaders is a lengthy legal and political tussle, candidates are taking care to lodge complaints against rivals right at the time of scrutiny of nominations. Having a third child through a second wife either after the death or divorce of the first wife after the cut-off date is no exemption to contest polls. However, the woman, who has one child after 1995 with a divorcee or widower with two children, is eligible to contest the election. The rule is that the candidate should not have three children biological children.

In some cases, particularly in rural areas, people who make woman live-in partners do not make their bond official to avoid legal complications from the first wife or family. However, they would get caught when the live-in partner gives birth to children as their names would be registered as father in records. A person is ineligible to contest even if his wife is carrying a third child.

KOLKATA: Two bikers on the flyover sustained severe injuries from kite strings when they were on the flyover. One of the incidents occurred near the Biswakarma building and the other near Boat Club. While one of the injured was admitted to Apollo Hospitals with cuts on his throat, the other was discharged from CNMC Hospital after being treated for injuries to his right hand.

In the first incident, Pramit Dutta (32), a resident of Netaji Subhas Road, was injured when a kite string cut through his chin around 4.55pm on Monday. He was admitted to the emergency ward at Apollo. Doctors said that he had a narrow escape.

In the second incident, Aktar Hossain (48), a resident of Salt Lake, received cut injuries on his right thumb when a kite string got wound his head on Maa flyover near Boat Club and he tried to remove it. The police said that they were trying to use CCTV footage from the area to identity the spot from where the kites were being flown.

Earlier, the Kolkata traffic police had proposed the installation of nets, view cutters or even 4ft high wiring on the southern flank of the Maa flyover that has, so far, witnessed over two dozen accidents to reduce chances of alloy-coated kite strings injuring bikers.

With the most common non-fatal lesions were found to be of the jugular veins, larynx and trachea. Cops also proposed that regular raids be carried across Kolkata — and not just southeast Kolkata — to seize such alloy-coated strings.

234,['11/03/2020'],"‘Diabetes, hypertension are most common cause of kidney ailments’","Madurai: Some of the high risk factors for chronic kidney disease are diabetes, hypertension, heart disease, obesity and family history and early diagnosis is key to prevent it, director and chief nephrologist of Madurai Kidney Centre and Transplantation Research Institute, Dr T Dhinakaran has said.

Addressing reporters on Tuesday ahead of the ‘World Kidney Day’ to be observed on March 12, Dhinakaran said, “The symptoms of a kidney disease don’t appear promptly, so getting tested is the only way to know if your kidneys are healthy. This is why there needs to be more awareness. Some of the symptoms of chronic kidney diseases include swelling of feet, ankles or legs, fatigue, consistent hypertension and bone damage.” For screening of kidney ailments, simple tests once in 6 months or 1 year like urine analysis, creatinine and eGFR, checking of blood pressure and sugar is recommended.

“Early diagnosis is key for good and complete recovery from chronic kidney disease. Early treatment can avoid need for dialysis and transplantation. During treatment, it is highly important to follow medical advice as prescribed by doctors when it comes to food and medicine intake,” he said.

Experts suggest reducing salt intake, eating a low-fat diet, a 30 minute exercise every day and regular health check-ups to prevent the onset of kidney disease. “Many think drinking lots of water can prevent kidney ailments. This is not completely true. An average adult needs around two litres of water per day. Both drinking water less than 600 ml or more than six litres can be detrimental to kidney health,” Dhinakaran said.

A Vinod Karuvarakundu, member of the committee who visited Malabar Christian College and the house of the deceased student Jaspreet Singh on Tuesday, said prima facie there were lapses on the part of college authorities in taking required steps to enable the student write the exam, despite him having genuine reasons for the attendance shortage.

“The ongoing internal investigation by the committee appointed by the management and the police probe are not looking into the factors which led to the suicide like the mental torture the student had to face. What is needed is a probe into the allegations raised by the family of the deceased student by an independent committee of the varsity and it should happen after placing the principal and the class teacher under suspension,” Vinod said.

He said the committee would submit report with recommendations to the MHRD and UGC and also the state higher education department and the university.

Vinod said the principal was handling the incident in a casual manner and added that it is a lapse on the part of the college that they did not visit the family of the deceased student. Also the family of the student has raised serious charges involving racial discrimination that a teacher asked the student to go to Punjab and write the exam.

“The student had a genuine reason for the attendance shortage and the college authorities should have given it due consideration,” he added.

Hamdullah, who visited the varsity on Tuesday, took up the issue with vice-chancellor Anil Vallathol and said Calicut University had named the centre after P M Sayeed in 2005 in recognition of his contribution to the overall development of the UT and in particular to honour his role in setting up of the centre at Andrott in Kavaratti and Kadmat islands.

In a letter to the vice-chancellor, he said it has been learnt that Lakshadweep MP Mohammed Faizal had raised the issue of changing the name of the centre during a meeting of syndicate members held recently.

UDF-affiliated syndicate member Rasheed Ahammed said the demand from some quarters to change the name of the centre was raised at the previous meeting of the syndicate and it was decided to ask a syndicate panel to look into the matter. “It will be highly deplorable if the name of the centre given to honour a late veteran leader from Lakshadweep is changed to suit some vested interests. The varsity centre was renamed after P M Sayeed in 2005 on the basis of a syndicate resolution. Changing the name now would lead to protests in the islands and the university should reject such requests,” he added.

237,['11/03/2020'],"Coronavirus in Pune: Stay away from gatherings, collector urges citizens amid coronavirus fear","Anxiety increases as the cases shoot up in Pune.

PUNE: Collector Naval Kishore Ram on Tuesday issued a strict advisory against any kind of gathering, while warning of legal action against those flouting these norms.

The advisory came after the count of novel coronavirus patients climbed to five in the city on Tuesday evening, from just two a day before.

The collector urged citizens to refrain from attending any kind of event or even going to cinema halls for any screening. While there is no closure of cinema halls or movie screenings, as done in Kerala, he said people should exercise caution. “It (cinema hall) is a place which can be avoided for a few days,’’ he said, adding, “My team will be reaching out to those holding events. If they do not adhere to the stringent advisory, legal action will follow.”

On school closure, he said strict guidelines would be issued if required. “We will take decision after consulting the government,’’ he said.

The collector said five squads had been formed to gather information about the contacts of the coronavirus positive patients. “The squads will verify if contacts of the patients are showing any symptoms of Covid-19. They will also keep a track of places the patients visited,” he said.

Appealing to all the doctors of the district through the Indian Medical Association (IMA), the collector said the doctors should keep the information of all the patients who are coming to India from foreign lands, separately.

Pune divisional commissioner Deepak Mhaisekar said a video-conferencing with the chief minister and others was expected on Wednesday.

Till March 10, a total of 1,29,448 passengers have been screened at Mumbai, Pune and Nagpur airports. According to the Union government’s new notification, passengers arriving from all over the world are being inspected at these three airports in the state.

238,['11/03/2020'],Holi traffic violations downto one-eighth of last year,"New Delhi: The traffic police booked 2 ,176 people for traffic violations during Holi on Tuesday. This is about one-eighth of the total challans — 16 ,000 — last year . More than 600 of these were booked for drunken driving .

Police officers say that the number of violations were visibly less this year. PCR calls too dipped sharply to 8,667 as compared to 18,798 last year. The cops are attributing it to increase in police presence. Police commissioner S N Shrivastava and other top cops monitored the functioning of their men on the ground all through the day. The traffic police had deployed more than 170 teams across the city at major intersections besides 131 joint teams of local police, PCR and traffic maintaining vigil. About 1600 men were on the ground.

One of the reasons could also be the fact that this time because of the coronavirus scare, the Holi celebrations were subdued and fewer people were driving on the road. According to traffic police, 647 people were booked for drunken driving; 181 people for triple riding; 1,156 for riding without helmets and 156 for dangerous driving.

The cops had sent out messages about safe driving during Holi. They had asked RWAs not to allow minors drive. Special teams with alcometers and others to chase down violators were present on roads. The PCR calls, according to the cops, were related to petty arguments and fights during Holi, most of which were resolved on the spot.

Vigil had also been stepped up in the riot-affected areas of north-east Delhi to prevent any confrontation between communities. The police had roped in aman committee members from all these areas to counsel people and conduct peace marches.

Meanwhile, three fatal accidents were reported on Tuesday. Two of these involved two-wheelers, while in the third, a man was mowed down by a speeding car. Police say the first accident was reported near Kanjhawala where a biker died after falling off his two-wheeler allegedly while speeding. A similar accident was reported near Civil Lines around the same time. The third accident was reported near Bijwasan where a man was mowed down by a speeding car.

A meeting in this regard was held by the chief secretary, and integration with an existing app of a private bank is being mulled. The same gateway can later be used for collecting garbage collection user charges, an official present in the meeting said.

“A presentation by ICICI Bank regarding the web and app-based solution for levying penalties for waste management was made in the meeting,” he said.

“The meeting also discussed certain gaps and legal hurdles in the implementation of digital pathways for levying the fines and charges. There are no provisions for levying penalties to offenders not complying with some provisions as per NGT directions and some sections of waste management rules. There is also an issue regarding appointment of appellate authority,” he added.

Municipal corporations are also in the process of imposing fines for not segregating waste while plans are afoot to start levying garbage charges. “We have been instructed to keep the household databank ready for every ward so that there is seamless transition and no problems are faced in user charge collection,” another municipal official said.

All the local body representatives in the review meeting agreed for a common payment gateway and management information system for levying penalties. “This will help in the monitoring of penalties at the common platform and shall display the requisite information to all the supervisors. During the meeting, ICICI Bank also agreed to proceed by integrating common payment gateway and MIS with the existing app by working in coordination with NIC,” the official added.

245,['11/03/2020'],"For better LIFE, corp opts for equality","Thiruvananthapuram: The city corporation has decided to prioritize harmony and equality over space and comfort in implementing the first LIFE tower under state’s housing mission in the state capital.

The corporation planned to construct the first apartment complex under LIFE mission at Karimadom which was earlier chosen for another housing scheme under basic services for urban poor ( BSUP ).

Officials brought to the notice of the administration that 320 dwelling units have already been constructed under BSUP at Karimadom and the dimensions of flat in terms of plinth area, number of bedrooms varied for BSUP and LIFE mission. Officials learned that having two set of flats with different dimensions to house people in the same area would create social inequality and could lead to problems that would derail the objectives of LIFE mission.

In BSUP, the plinth area unit is 40.30m2 and it has one bedroom, multipurpose hall, kitchen, toilet cum bath and a balcony/ verandah. While in the LIFE mission project, the plinth area of the flat is 46.45m2 and with two bedrooms, a hall, kitchen, balcony and separate toilet & bath.

Corporation mayor K Sreekumar informed LIFE mission that implementing dwellings of differing facilities may cause social issues among the residents of the colony. Hence, he requested to give sanction to Thiruvananthapuram Corporation to take forward LIFE Tower project of executing 52 dwelling units comprising 20 units of 37.75m2 and 32units of 40.01 m2 instead of 44 dwelling units at a maximum estimated cost of Rs.4.62 crores.

The corporation has identified 50 cents of land for construction of LIFE towers in Karimadom colony. A total of 560 dwelling units are proposed to be built under BSUP scheme, of which 320 units have been completed and 112 units are under construction.

LIFE mission CEO wrote to the state government that the deviation request by corporation can be considered favourably and LSGD has now given sanction to alter the approved dimension of flats in LIFE tower which will be constructed at Karimadom.

Project officials with housing mission had to deal with numerous instances where beneficiaries continuously alleged complaints regarding selection, shifting to interim shelters and even grievances that flats had been awarded to ineligible beneficiaries. It is in the light of these previous experiences that the officials recommended cutting down on space and rooms to ensure peace and equality in the housing colony.

The city corporation is set to purchase nine acres for the construction of apartment complexes under LIFE housing mission after a series of botched attempts to find plots for housing complexes.

246,['11/03/2020'],"Party chief’s faith changes fate of Pilli, Mopidevi","Amaravati: Luck, they say, plays a pivotal role in politics. Who better than veteran leaders Mopidevi Venkata Ramana Rao and Pilli Subhashchandra Bose to exemplify that. In the last one decade, both leaders have thought of quitting active politics several times and each time they have been thwarted. One of the prime reasons for their wish to quit was that they were not wealthy enough to continue contesting even after biting the dust in back to back elections. But as luck would have it, the party chief never lost faith in them.

Let us look at Rao for instance. He has set a new record as the first MP from the fishermen community in the state. Rao entered public life at a young age. He worked for Congress students’ organisations, National Students’ Union of India, and youth Congress before becoming mandal parishad president in 1984 when he was only 21. He grabbed an assembly ticket in 1989 but lost his first battle despite Congress sweeping the elections. He faced defeat in the subsequent 1994 election as well.

But given his following among the Backward Classes in the constituency, Congress retained him as candidate in 1999 and he tasted luck the very same year. After winning the 2004 election, he joined the YSR cabinet. By winning the 2009 elections he delivered a hat-trick of victories and continued in the cabinet.

Post the bifurcation of the state in 2014, Rao joined the YSRC and stood by Jaganmohan Reddy. He was the first prominent leader to be arrested by the CBI in connection with Jaganmohan Reddy’s disproportionate assets case. After facing jail term, Rao suffered health issues and eventually lost the 2014 election. But again, the party leader did not lose faith in him. Jaganmohan Reddy fielded him from Repalle in 2019.

Surprisingly, Rao lost the segment with a massive margin even when YSRC virtually swept the state. Party colleagues were of the opinion that the poll debacle must be the end of his political journey. Surprisingly, Rao was named as part of Jaganmohan Reddy’s cabinet even before becoming MLC. But now with the governemnt set to abolish the council, Rao is set to join the Rajya Sabha. “It is my leader Jagan who has always stood by me. Entering the Rajya Sabha has been a dream for me,” Mopidevi told TOI.

The story has been almost similar when it comes to the fate of Bose, one of the five deputy chief ministers. He parted ways with the Congress and joined Jaganmohan Reddy in 2010.

Later, he lost the byelections in 2012 and general elections in 2014 from Ramachandrapuram constituency. YSRC then nominated him to the legislative council in 2016. Despite being an MLC, the party fielded him in the 2019 elections from Mandapet. However, Bose lost his third consecutive election. Yet, Jaganmohan Reddy made him a party of the state cabinet and deputy CM. “Jagan is the first CM in the history to send a BC from East Godavari district to Rajya Sabha,” said Bose.

248,['11/03/2020'],Double murder: Aide of key accused held,"New Delhi: Vikrant Nagar , who was arrested for the murder of a mother- daughter duo in Vasundhara Enclave, had woven a web of lies to woo Samrita (25). He had not only scripted a false story about being an orphan, but also claimed to be a drug abuse survivor.

Nagar had called his friend Shanky Sharma to Delhi to help him execute the murder. Sharma was arrested on Tuesday. Police said when they arrested Sharma it came to fore that he had reached Delhi from Mumbai via a GoAir flight around 10.30pm on Sunday. He went straight to Mansara apartments where the victims resided.

Nagar told the police officers that Samrita and her mother, Sumita Mary, had started to ignore him for the last few weeks. “He said he loved the girl and did everything for her in the last four years of their relationship. Later, she started getting close to someone else. Samrita initially ignored him, and later her mother too. He claimed to be upset by this,” said a cop privy to the investigation.

“On Sunday, Nagar brought a new SIM card. The accused duo entered the building around 2.30am. Nagar called up Samrita and asked her to come to the gate to meet him. As soon as she left home, the duo entered the house and killed her mother using the kitchen knife, which has been recovered. In the meantime, Samrita returned home and she too was stabbed to death. The duo then left the house, along with their cash, jewellery and Maruti Suzuki Baleno car ,” said the officer.

“They did not know how to drive properly and hence left the car near Trilokpuri in east Delhi . From there, they booked a cab and Nagar left for his house and Sharma to a hotel in East of Kailash,” the police officer added.

Nagar then gave the SIM to his mother and told her that he was going to meet his friends in Jaipur. Police officials traced the number and reached the mother who informed them that her son had left for Jaipur. He was arrested midway from near Manoharpur.

Sharma resided in the area close to Nagar’s house and supplied tiffins to different guesthouses in south Delhi area five years back. He had later moved to Mumbai to pursue his modelling career. The two had become friends as they shared a common interest for modelling. Police said the two are drug addicts.

Sharma had also purchased two mobile phones from the robbed money, which were recovered by the police.

249,['11/03/2020'],MV Act rules to be in place for spot payment,"New Delhi: Motorists caught violating traffic rules may soon be able to pay fine for some of the offences on the spot .

Delhi government is likely to notify the amended Motor Vehicles (MV) Act, which was implemented in September last year, by Friday. Sources said the government has not made any changes in the amount of penalty and agreed to implement the same fine as prescribed by the Parliament in the amended Act. The lieutenant governor has already approved the proposal and the file is awaiting final clearance from the law department of Delhi government before notification.

Though motorists violating the traffic rules are still paying enhanced penalties as prescribed in the amended act, they are forced to go to court since the Act has not been notified by Delhi government.

Section 200 of the MV Act authorises the state government to fix the quantum of penalty for some offences that are compoundable and traffic police and the state transport department have the power to collect the fine on the spot. The amended MV Act prescribed penalties for 61 offences and out of these, the state government doesn’t have any discretion in the case of 27 offences.

Delhi government has the discretion of keeping the penalty 100% as prescribed in the Act or reduce it in the case of 34 compoundable offences.

For instance, the penalty for talking on mobile phone while driving is Rs 5,000, but if the government decides, the quantum of the penalty can be fixed at Rs 2,000 if the offender is paying the fine on the spot.

The MV Act is in the Concurrent List and the Centre brought the Act. The Delhi government, however, kept the notification in abeyance and let traffic violators pay enhanced penalty in courts.

Sources said special commissioner of police (traffic) Taj Hasan in a meeting with Delhi transport minister Kailash Gahlot and other officials of the department had requested for the notification of the Act at the earliest as it led to increased workload on courts.

A corporation source said, “The dump yard receives about 1,050 tonnes of solid waste every day. But in the last couple of days, the quantity has come down by 100 tonnes per day.”

Pointing out that more than 5,000 sanitary workers are working in the city, the source said that the protest has not created any major impact on the waste collection system of the city.

More than 1,000 temporary sanitary workers boycotted work and staged a protest at the corporation office in Town Hall on Tuesday. They condemned the corporation for failing to provide them first preference while recruiting people for the posts of permanent sanitary workers.

Municipal administration minister SP Velumani on Friday handed over appointment orders to close to 350 candidates who were selected for the posts of permanent sanitary workers.

“Most of the sanitary workers are working for more than 10 years on temporary basis with the corporation. It is unfair to neglect them and recruit fresh candidates when the temporary workers had been demanding regularization of job,” DMK MLA N Karthik said. Karthik held talks with corporation commissioner J Sravan Kumar on behalf of the workers on Tuesday.

He said close to 700 temporary workers were recruited and posts of permanent workers were filled when the DMK was in power.

“There is a provision to make them permanent. The corporation has not tried,” he said. There is no transparency in the functioning of the corporation in the absence of council, he added.

Explaining how sanitation condition of the city is already at stake, he said that the condition would degrade further if the corporation fails to convince the workers to get back to work. The corporation should hold talks with the workers and give assurance to make them permanent, he added.

MADURAI: There is no harm in consuming chicken and egg, minister for animal husbandry Udumalai K Radhakrishnan said on Tuesday. He warned stringent action against those spreading rumours about Covid-19 and bird flu and linking them with poultry consumption.

The minister was talking to reporters in Kovilpatti after taking part in some functions at Kalugumalai and Kattalankulam in Tuticorin district .

“Thousands are working in the chicken and egg industry. The industry fetches revenue to the tune of several crore rupees for Tamil Nadu,” the minister said and appealed to consumers not to believe in rumours.

The minister said the bird flu situation had been brought under control in Kozhikode district of Kerala where the outbreak was reported last weekend. Elaborating on the measures taken by the department to prevent bird flu in Tamil Nadu, the minister said 26 disinfection camps had been established at check posts on the Tamil Nadu-Kerala border.

A majority of these to disinfect trucks and vehicles entering Tamil Nadu are established in The Nilgiris (8) and Coimbatore (12) considering their proximity to Kozhikode. “Teams are also disinfecting trucks at Tirupur, Tenkasi and Kanyakumari ,” he said. The minister said that poultry farms in the western districts (poultry hubs of the state) are under round-the-clock surveillance.

To a question on filling up posts of veterinarians in the state, the minister said that 650 have been appointed by the government. He added that 200 more vacancies created due to opening of more branch hospitals and dispensaries will be filled up in the coming year. A government order (GO) has also been passed for building 120 dispensaries at Rs 43 crore.

252,['11/03/2020'],Storm of allegations breaks out over pre-poll ordinance,"Vijayawada: With the announcement of local body elections, liquor seems to have taken political centre stage.

While the state government has brought in an ordinance, which disqualifies the candidates and sentence them to up to three years in jail if it were to be proved that they distributed money and liquor to voters.

This would be appplicable even if the election is over and the candidates have won them. But the opposition has alleged that it is only a way to deter their candidates from contesting.

The opposition parties have alleged that while on the one hand the ruling party has been distributing liquor through village volunteers, on the other hand, cases are being booked against other party cadres for ‘illegal possession of liquor’.

The YSRC, however, has condemned the allegations and retorted stating that the opposition is scared of losing the election with curbs put in place on distribution of liquor during elections.

A case in point would the incident, which took place at Edupalli of Nagaram mandal in Guntur district, on Tuesday. Tensions prevailed at Edupalli after police arrested a man identified as Alla Chowdary on charges of possessing 87 bottles of liquor. However, the TDP has alleged that the police are foisting false cases against their cadre.

Following the arrest, Telugu Desam Party Repalle MLA, Anagani Satya Prasad, staged a dharna demanding the release of Chowdary and suspension of Nagaram sub-inspector who booked the case against Chowdary.

“When buying a single bottle of liquor has become difficult these days, how can a person buy 87 bottles,” he questioned, adding, that even if it has happened it was the failure of the government in preventing a man from buying 87 bottles of liquor.

He said the YSRC is trying file false cases against potential TDP candidates so that they are unable to contest the elections” he said. Meanwhile, TDP MLC Buddha Venkanna has demanded that liquor shops be shut till the elections are completed.

Advisor to the government on public affairs, Sajjala Ramakrishna Reddy hit, has back at the TDP on the allegations and said instead of feeling happy with the government’s ordinace, the opposition complaining about it. “The opposition has accepted defeat even before the elections have been held,” he claimed.

But there is no clarity on whether liquor shops will be shut down till elections are completed. Although the minister for irrigation Anil Kumar Yadav has said that liquor shops will be closed from March 12, sources in the excise department said they have not received any direction from the government with regard to the issue.

Mohammed Ali hailing from Andaman and Nicobar Islands is the accused.

The case pertains to the abduction and murder of Mandal, who was a student of College of Engineering Trivandrum at Sreekaryam in October 2005. He was also a resident of Andaman and Nicobar Islands. Besides Ali, there is one more accused in the case, Durga Jeg Bahadur from Nepal. He remains an absconder to this date.

The trial commenced on Tuesday by examining Mandal’s 75-year-old father Basudev Mandal. He identified the accused Ali as the one who had contacted him on phone demanding ransom of Rs 10 lakh to spare his son’s life. Mandal also identified the mobile phone of his son that was recovered from the accused following their arrests.

On October 13, 2005, Mandal was abducted by Ali with the help of his accomplice Bahadur. They called Mandal on his phone pretending as a friend from Andaman and Nicobar Islands and then abducted him. In the following days, they contacted Basudev over phone and demanded a ransom of Rs 10 lakh, which the latter deposited in a bank account as per the directions of the accused. But, on October 24, 2005, Mandal’s body was found in a sack abandoned among bushes near Kovalam. He was apparently killed by his throat slit.

The case was initially probed by the local police. In 2008, it was handed over to the CBI. The CBI investigators tracked down and arrested Ali by probing the transactions of the bank account in which the ransom amount was deposited. They also arrested another man, Kesav Kumar Katwal. Katwal was arrested after the investigators found Mandal’s phone in his possession. Later, it was revealed that he was innocent, and he bought the phone from Ali unaware of the crime.

The prosecution case is that Ali planned and executed the crime to extract money from Basudev. Ali knew that Basudev, despite being a school teacher, was into the business of moneylending and had huge amounts of money with him.

The chargesheet in the case was filed in the year 2010. The trial got delayed after it was transferred from CBI court in Kochi to the CBI special court in Thiruvananthapuram, which was established in 2012.

Counsel A Brammah who appeared for T Narayanan, 75, of Maharaja Nagar in Tirunelveli city, said that his client purchased an LED TV and a stabiliser for Rs 29,500 at the Palayamkottai branch of the store on April 29, 2018.

The consumer was assured a small travel bag as gift for the purchase but the bill had a price tag of Rs 78.12. Annoyed with the billing for a gift bag that had the advertisement of the shop, the customer approached the store manager where he was humiliated by the staff. They also asked him to donate the bag if he was not interested, after which he contacted the office of the owner of the chain, but in vain.

Narayanan approached the forum in July 2018. On completion of the trial, the forum president F Devadas and members M Muthulakshmi and S Sivanmoorthi on Monday gave the direction to the dealer.

This included refund of Rs 78 charged for the bag, Rs 15,000 for mental agony caused to the consumer and Rs 5,000 towards legal expenses incurred for the case. On failing to make the payment within one month, an interest of 6% has to be paid, the forum said.

It is a matter of great satisfaction that despite heavy odds, the library has been able to utilise its budgetary allocation completely and renew its subscription to electronic databases.”

The three months when the library was closed were also utilsed for migrating the library management software to an open source software from the commercial one for more effective integration and discovery of resources, the varsity stated.

Officiating vice-chancellor Ilyas Husain said that he hopes the old section of the library will also be opened soon. It was the videos from the old section of the library that had gone viral last month. In the several CCTV footages, the varsity students were seen being attacked by lathi-wielding cops.

263,['11/03/2020'],Usurping govt land: HC orders probe by independent agency,"Kochi: The high court has ordered the state government to conduct an inquiry by an independent agency on the practice of landless persons obtaining government property and selling it to land mafia by acting in nexus.

Justice P Somarajan issued the order after considering two separate cases where sale agreements were signed for lands assigned to landless persons even before the ban on alienation of the assigned lands was over. The cases reached the court as dispute rose between subsequent buyers regarding execution of the agreements.

To circumvent the clause in the pattayam preventing alienation for a period of three years, the period of contract for sale was agreed and fixed just after expiry of three years, the court pointed out. Also, relaxation was given by the government to the seven-year ban on alienation to three years, the judgment said.

If the government has introduced the ban on alienation for the benefit of landless person, there should necessarily be adequate measure to preserve the land for the landless, the court said. But, instead of incorporating adequate measures, a relaxation has been given by the government to sell the property to strangers just upon completion of three years, the judgment stated.

The striking similarity in the two cases would certainly show that it is not an exception but an indication of large-scale manipulation, the court said.

In the instant cases, not only did the property assigned to landless person change hands prior to the expiry of the ban on alienation, the state government has so far not challenged or objected it, the court pointed out.

“The state government is duty bound to protect the interests of landless person... The reduction of period of restriction… gives the land mafia a shot in the arm in getting the property of landless person in their name. This would show an illegal nexus between the land mafia and landless persons in extorting the property belonging to the state government…,” the court said in the judgment.

“The reduction of period of alienation into three years further encourages an easy mode to plunder the property of state government. Since it is not an exception but involves systematic gobbling up of property belonging to the government in large scale under the veneer of landless persons, a detailed enquiry by an independent agency is imperative and the state government is duty bound to conduct such an enquiry to expose the nefarious activities of the land mafia,” the court added.

The two inundation prone spots are located near the District Industries Centre (DIC) and opposite to the corporation’s two-wheeler parking lot in the bus stand. The pits will be two-feet deep with each having perforated PVC pipe going a depth of 12m.

“The pits will be filled with sand and gravel to filter the water. Since each of the borewells are 12m deep and six-inch in diameter, they will be sufficient enough to prevent water stagnation,” an official with Trichy Corporation said. The rainwater harvesting pits shall be positioned in vacant adjacent spaces along the roads and will not affect vehicular movement.

The move comes after the success of rainwater harvesting pit established near Cantonment police station. The junction where Reynolds and Benwells roads meet is now free from water stagnation ever since the rainwater harvesting pit was established.

Trichy Corporation said that a survey is underway to identify inundation prone areas for establishing similar roadside rainwater harvesting pits.

265,['11/03/2020'],Ex-Patparganj MLA to head DPCC,"New Delhi: In a bid to involve young leaders to lead the party, Congress on Wednesday appointed former MLA Anil Chaudhary as the president of Delhi Pradesh Congress Committee ( DPCC ).

Chaudhary (44) represented east Delhi’s Patparganj assembly constituency from 2008 to 2013. Prior to that, he had won the civic body elections twice and was the president of Delhi Youth Congress .

Of the five vice-presidents appointed by Congress interim-president Sonia Gandhi on Wednesday, four are less than 50 years of age. They include municipal councillor Abhishek Dutt, Shivani Chopra, Mudit Agarwal and Ali Hassan, apart from veteran party leader and three-time MLA Jai Kishan.

Other than Mudit, all the four newly appointed vice-presidents had contested the recently concluded state assembly elections.

While Mudit is the son of veteran leader and former MP JP Agarwal, Shivani’s father Subhash Chopra is the outgoing chief of Delhi Congress . Ali Hassan’s father Hasaan Ahmed was elected MLA from Mustafabad twice in 2008 and 2013.

Subhash Chopra had resigned as DPCC chief taking moral responsibility for the party’s debacle in the state polls. Appointed in October, three months after his predecessor Sheila Dikshit died in July 2019, Chopra held that position for a brief period of five months.

After three consecutive defeats in state polls, including two complete routs in 2015 and 2020 when it failed to even win a single seat in the 70 member House, Congress in the capital is in a shambles at the moment. In the recent polls, the party could barely manage 4.3% votes.

“I agree that the condition of the party is not good. Congress took its vision to the people of Delhi and highlighted the failures of the rival parties. People also appreciate Congress government’s contribution between 1998 and 2013 but it did not translate into votes,” Chaudhary added.

“Chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan had personally assured to lay the foundation stone for Chattambi Swami memorial on March 10.

Chattambi Swami was the pioneer of the Hindu renaissance movement in Kerala. “It has been a long-cherished dream to build a memorial for Swami who was born and raised in Thiruvananthapuram,” he said.

The dharna concluded with an exhortation for stronger and more protests. Corporation parliamentary party leader M R Gopan, office bearers of various Hindu outfits, Vidyadhiraja Trust spoke on the occasion.

267,['11/03/2020'],Cops baffled as Pudukottai man claims to be ‘Salem stoneman’,"Rajesh Kumar

SALEM: Who is the real ‘ Salem stoneman ’ is the question that is haunting the city police as a 27-year-old habitual offender has recently confessed to the three murders that sent shock waves in the city in the first three days of February. His confession comes more than two weeks after the arrest of a 20-year-old man, who had earlier confessed to have bludgeoned the three to death with stones to steal money to buy ganja.

In the wake of recent developments, police not only denied to have obtained confessional statement from M Andisamy, of Sitheriyur village in Dindigul district, under any duress, but also said the school topper in Class X board exams was sent behind bars only after forensic labs in Chennai and Bengluru confirmed that the images in the CCTV footages from the crime scenes matched with that of Andisamy.

City police commissioner T Senthil Kumar said, “We arrested Andisamy on February 21 based on his confessional statement. Evidence that were collected from the crime spots also matched nearly 70% with his statements.”

However, Pudukottai-based Rajesh Kumar’s confession to the crimes have left the city police, who had earlier formed 16 special teams to crack the case, in a predicament again.

Senthil Kumar said the statements of Rajesh and material evidence such as his clothes were matching with the evidence that were collected from the crime scenes.

Arrested by the Pudukottai district police on March 6 in connection with a robbery case, Rajesh told them that he was the one who murdered two beggars and a night security in Salem on February 1, 2 and 3. They alerted their counterparts in Salem on March 7 and the latter took Rajesh into the custody on Monday. An orphan, Rajesh is also a ganja addict like Andisamy.

According to an investigation officer, Rajesh had committed his first murder at the age of 13. “He murdered a girl in 2009 in Trichy by pushing her into a well. He was sentenced to four years imprisonment and sent to a borstal.”

The officer said while Rajesh was said to have bludgeoned a pedestrian to death in Karur district in 2015 and murdered another person in Trichy city in 2018, there weren’t any charges pending against him regarding those two cases.

“However, the Srirangam police in Trichy had arrested him in November 2019 in connection with a murder that was reported in their police limits. He came out on bail in January 2020,” the officer said.

Senthil Kumar said Rajesh’s photos and CCTV footages from crime spots have been sent to the forensic lab in Chennai for verifying facts.

While Rajesh has been lodged in the Salem Central Prison on Tuesday, the city police have approached the Salem district court, seeking its direction to remove Andisamy’s names from the three murder case files.

The city police commissioner said his department would take the responsibility of rehabilitating Andisamy, a ganja addict, if he was found not guilty. “We will first interrogate him and rehabilitate him, if he is found to be innocent.”

It is to be noted that Andisamy is said to have bludgeoned an alms seeker to death with a stone in Velankanni in December 2019.

COIMBATORE: A 39-year-old man was arrested and lodged in the Coimbatore Central Prison on Tuesday for his hate speech against the RSS, BJP and police department during an anti-CAA meeting that was held at Selvapuram here in February.

The Selvapuram police identified the accused as P Balamurugan alias Ayya Vazhi Balamurugan, of Palayamkottai in Tirunelveli district. He was booked under Sections 143 (punishment for unlawful assembly), 153 (B) (imputations, assertions prejudicial to national integration), 341 (punishment for wrongful restraint), 502 (sale of printed or engraved substance containing defamatory matter) and 504 (intentional insult with intent to provoke breach of the peace) of the Indian Penal Code.

Meanwhile, a video of Balamurugan went viral on social media on Tuesday in which he said the Islamic outfits had paid him Rs500 and taken care of his travel and food expenses for speaking in their meetings. “If my speech has hurt the central and state government, police department and Hindu people, I am apologizing. Hereafter, I won’t participate in such meeting and protest,” he said in the video.

Founder of Ayyavazhi Yuga Peravai, a police officer said, Balamurugan used to attend anti-CAA meetings that were conducted by various Muslim outfits in the state. “On February 22, he addressed a public meeting at Selvapuram and requested the Muslim women to beat policemen with sandals or broomsticks if they enter their protest site. He also said many Muslims had deserted the AIADMK after the ruling party supported the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) in parliament and defamed the Muslims, who were still supporting the party. He also blamed the BJP and RSS.”

Police have also formed a special team to nab a few more people for their hate speech.

PUNE: Muted celebrations marked the festival of colours in the city on Tuesday, with the cancellation of several Holi parties and events in the wake of the novel coronavirus (Covid-19) scare.

While several youths could be seen taking to the streets with colours to celebrate the festival, most citizens either stayed home or restricted the celebrations to their housing societies, especially after two persons tested positive for the contagion in the city on Monday evening. The number of positive cases reached five by Tuesday late evening.

IT professional Prerna Goyal said, “We had initially planned to go out to play Holi at a friend’s housing society. This plan was, however, scrapped due to the coronavirus scare. Eventually, we restricted the celebration to our home with some of our family members paying us a visit during the day.”

A Wakad resident said his society members indulged in “a sort of dry holi” celebrations. “We did not use water to celebrate the festival and also limited the size of the gathering. We have also alerted all the residents against Covid-19 as most of them work in large offices. Our focus is on maintaining strictest hygiene, especially at handrails along staircases and the lift areas. Besides, after playing Holi, the revellers discarded all the clothes they wore during the celebration,” he said.

Wakdewadi resident Harshita Sanghvi said, “It did not feel like Holi at all this year as there were hardly any celebrations. We did not even see people playing on the streets either.”

City resident Diksha Kini, currently in Bengaluru, said the celebrations remained low-key even there. “In fact, we had notices put up in the housing society asking people to avoid chemical colours. The notices urged people to use turmeric and beetroot water instead of artificial colours.”

According to restaurateurs from the city, several events were called for hosting Holi events. The Mills, for example, had announced Holi celebrations but cancelled the event a day in advance due to lack of permission. A partner at a restaurant at The Mills said, “We have not even arranged for a private party on our premises.”

President of Pune Restaurants and Hoteliers Association (PRAHA), Ganesh Shetty said the Pune police had cancelled all Holi party permissions in light of the Covid-19 scare.

Pune police commissioner K Venkatesham said several establishments had pro-actively called off their Holi events. “We saw muted Holi celebrations this year. The enthusiasm was lower due to coronavirus scare. Most establishments cancelled their events on their own,” he said.

PUNE: It was a cool Holi for residents on Tuesday, as day temperature took a plunge, with mercury slipping by over 2 degrees to 30.6°C in Shivajinagar.

In Lohegaon, day temperature dropped slightly to 33.1°C, from Monday’s 34.7°C.

Shivajinagar’s day temperature was almost as low as Mumbai on Tuesday, where Colaba and Santacruz recorded 30.4°C and 30.5°C respectively. Day temperatures are usually lower in coastal locations than inland places, due to the influence of cool sea winds.

During the next two days, day temperatures in Pune are likely to range from 32-34°C, while night temperature may increase to 17°C, as per IMD forecast. On Tuesday, the minimum temperature in Shivajinagar was 15.5°C and 17.5°C in Lohegaon.

A senior scientist at the India Meteorological Department (IMD), Pune, said Madhya Maharashtra, including Pune, is currently under the influence of moderate westerly winds. “This, in association with a cyclonic circulation as well as a troughline is keeping temperatures lower than normal because they are also dragging moisture, which is causing partly cloudy skies during the day,” he said.

Partly cloudy skies during the day hinder the passage of solar insolation to the earth’s surface. This causes a drop in day temperatures.

“Partly cloudy sky conditions are expected to continue over Pune city and district till March 12,” the scientist explained.

Police said that these were not crime-related murders and personal enmity and illicit affair were the motives behind the murders. The accused were arrested in two cases .

In New Usmanpur, a man murdered his relative, Kiran Pal, after playing Holi with him. At 3pm on Tuesday, Mithun came to meet Pal, applied colours on him and shot him dead, police said.

Police have also arrested Sachin’s friend, Vijay, and the woman, Jyoti, for their involvement in the crime. Kumar, police said, had made some objectionable videos of Jyoti and was blackmailing her after she began to distance herself from him. Jyoti then told Sachin everything.

On Monday night, Jyoti called Kumar to meet her at an under-construction building. When Kumar reached there, Sachin and Vijay allegedly beat him to death with sticks. Cops arrested the trio after scanning Pal’s call records.

Meanwhile, on Tuesday night, police were alerted about the murder of a man who had been assaulted and stabbed to death. The body was found on the railway tracks in Wazirpur Industrial Area.

MADURAI: The Covid-19 scare has brought hand sanitizers, which were not available in pharmacies and departmental stores early this week, back to the shelves of even small shops in plenty now. While they sell at twice the normal rate, indications are that they could be substandard duplicate products.

Parvathy, a homemaker in Anna Nagar, said she found that none of the shops in her area had hand sanitizers when she looked to purchase it in bulk for her entire family. ``So I bought two bottles of dettol handwash and gave my number to the pharmacist to call me as soon as he got a fresh stock of sanitizers,’’ she said. Many others too could not find sanitizers in any store. A shop in Anna Nagar called her up on Monday to inform her of stock arrival but told her that she would have to hurry as they were selling like hot cakes.

The price of a 55 ml bottle of sanitizer from company called PSK stated that it contained 95% ethyl alcohol, but there was no price tag on it. ``It is usually Rs 100, but now we are giving it for Rs 55 to our regular customers,’’ said the shopkeeper adding that he had kept aside bottles to supply only to known customers. However, there was no evidence that it contained alcohol, as it did not have that cooling effect that a high alcohol-containing sanitizer usually has, she said.

Many such unbranded products claiming to have alcohol content flew off the shelves on Tuesday also. Some cottage industries are now exploring ways of making sanitizers, ``It is just aloe vera, alcohol, a perfume, and two other ingredients, and I know how to do it,’’ said Satish of Thirupalai. ``If you want branded products, you can purchase online, but as of now hand sanitizers are not available even on Amazon. If you order a bottle, it takes it to the wishlist,’’ said S Suresh of Vilangudi.

Assistant director of drugs control, Madurai, N C Ravichandran said they were monitoring the availability of sanitizers and masks in Madurai, but there were sufficient stocks now. If any complaints of duplicate products were brought to their notice they would act on it. He said the general public should take precautions like washing hands regularly with soap and water. “It is the vulnerable population including medical staff and practitioners who have to use alcohol-based sanitizers,’’ he said.

276,['11/03/2020'],Cop awarded for fighting off gang alone in southeast Delhi,"Top cop S N Shrivastava felicitated ASI Faiyaz Ahmed for his brave act

NEW DELHI: There was high drama in southeast Delhi’s Govindpuri last week when four criminals attacked a head constable after he flagged them down. The gang, led by notorious robber Deepak alias Deepu Nepali, attacked the policemen, ASI Faiyaz Ahmed , with his khukri.

Ahmed, however, did not retreat and grappled with them. Somehow he managed to whip out his service pistol and opened fire at the men, which forced them to back off and flee.

Ahmed was rushed to a hospital and given treatment. On Wednesday, Delhi Police commissioner S N Shrivastava felicitated Ahmed for his brave act.

A few months ago, a gang had committed an armed robbery at a grocery store and fled with Rs 1 lakh and other goods. Ahmed was investigating the case and had been trailing Deepak and his associates for a while. “On March 7, Ahmed received a tip-off about Deepak planning another crime in the area. He rushed to the site and found him and four others standing at the corner of a lane. When the ASI asked the men to surrender, they attacked him before fleeing from the spot,” DCP (South East) R P Meena said.

However, a team comprising inspector Satish Rana tracked the accused to somewhere near Nepal border. Since the border picket near Sanauli was cordoned, Deepak gave up on his plan and returned to Delhi. “He had come to Navjivan camp to collect money from his friends but was nabbed,” said an officer.

Deepak worked as a driver but took to crime for big money. Cops are looking for his associates.

SALEM: An activist has petitioned the chief minister’s special cell, seeking action against district collector S A Raman and Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowment (HR&CE) department officials for allowing villagers of Ulipuram to conduct jallikattu on a temple land, without obtaining permission from the HR&CE commissioner.

In his petition, A Radhakrishnan said the villagers have been preparing to conduct the bull taming sport on Wednesday (March 11) and that the land chosen for the event belonged to Vinayakar temple in the locality.

He said the villagers had approached the district administration, seeking permission to conduct jallikattu and that the collector had given nod on Monday after inspecting the elaborate arrangements that they had made for the event.

Radhakrishnan said the villagers were yet to get any permission from the HR&CE department. “They should get permission from the HR&CE commissioner as they are planning to conduct the event on temple land, which they have already damaged to erect stage and galleries.”

When contacted, A Natarajan, HR&CE joint commissioner (incharge), Salem zone, said neither the villagers nor the department had informed him about the event. “I will check with local HR&CE officials.”

Meanwhile, the collector said there was nothing wrong in conducting such events on temple land. “HR&CE commissioner could give his consent even on the day of the event. There is nothing wrong in carrying out preparations for the event before getting his consent. The district administration would ensure that the villagers carry out repair works after the event.”

Radhakrishnan, however, said he would move the Madras high court , seeking action against the district collector and HR&CE officials for damaging the temple land.

280,['11/03/2020'],Postal department plans to popularize its app,"The system was launched more than a year ago

COIMBATORE: With required infrastructure in place, the Coimbatore circle of the postal department plans to popularize an app called the India Post Payments Bank (IPPB) among its postal bank account holders.

This app like Google Pay or Paytm allows us to send and receive money from people and pay utility bills. But the crucial difference is that this app also acts like a mobile ATM. People can withdraw and deposit money from their doorstep—homes or offices—via postmen . The system was launched more than a year ago.

“We are specifically targeting college students and people in rural areas, who probably have low balance accounts and do not have an ATM machine within walking distance,” said senior superintendent of post offices, Coimbatore division, Sudhir Gopal Jakhere.

“The IPPB even allows for zero balance and brings the ATM system to their hostels and places of work or houses,” he added.

How does your postman become a mobile ATM? Nearly 460 postmen and Gramin Dakh Sevaks in the district have been given IPPB hand-held devices. When a postman visits an account holder’s house or office, he can accept deposits and will be carrying a maximum of Rs 5,000 in cash for the account holder to make withdrawals too. “People who need to withdraw more cash can call 155299 and inform them. The postman will then come to your home or office with more cash,” an official said. “Currently, postmen are only accepting deposits and not carrying cash for withdrawals, but we will start that facility soon,” he said.

The IPPB has 4,222 account holders, which is a small fraction of the 10-lakh postal savings bank account holders in the circle. “We plan to start increasing the number of account holders first among the existing postal savings bank account holders and bring in new accounts,” Jakhere said.

“This bank makes holding an account with the postal department attractive, because they don’t need to stand in queues in post offices anymore for cash deposits or withdrawals or visit our ATMs for the same,” he said.

People who want to access the app need to open an India Post Payment Bank account, which in turn can be done only if you have postal savings bank account. Both will be instantly linked along with the holder’s Aadhar card details too. They also get a QR code when they open an account, which is said to be more secure than a credit or debit card. “When the postman arrives at your doorstep, you can either scan your QR code in his device or give your Aadhar number, to make a cash deposit or withdrawal. There are no charges for most of the transaction. You can also deposit money for recurring deposits in postal savings schemes or to pay bills through this app, like Paytm or Google Pay,” Jakhere said.

People interested in opening accounts can call 04222301224 or 9787488203.

The board, which assessed the situation at its meeting held here on Tuesday, also directed the temples under its jurisdiction to cancel all festivals, processions and other events including cultural programmes ‘which are likely to attract a large number of people’, and to conduct only rituals which are unavoidable.

“In line with the precautionary measures being initiated by the state government to check spread of Covid-19, we urge devotees not to come for darshan when Sabarimala temple opens for monthly pooja on Friday,” TDB president N Vasu told reporters after the meeting. He, however, said the board was not planning to use force to deter devotees.

“We don’t think such extreme measures would be required as we expect devotees to cooperate and postpone their pilgrimage. Only poojas and usual rituals will be conducted by priests and those assigned for that, which do not require the presence of devotees or TDB employees or those from other departments on special duty. Appam and aravana counters will remain closed,” Vasu said.

TDB will also make an announcement in this regard in local television channels in southern states, from where a large number of devotees would have already planned their Sabarimala darshan this month, he said.

“We also hope the state government will ask their counterparts in neighbouring states to discourage devotees from making the pilgrimage this month,” Vasu said.

He, however, said the board was yet to take a decision on imposing similar restrictions during the Painkuni Uthram festival in Sabarimala scheduled for the last week of the month.

TRICHY: In the wake of Covid-19 threat, food safety and drug administration department has advised major hotels in the city to conduct thermometer gun screening on foreign tourists. It is also planning to put up posters displaying the methods of hand washing in all the restaurants.

Designated officer of food safety and drug administration department Dr R Chithra said advisories have been issued to more than 10 hotels in the city to keep infrared gun for checking the temperature of foreign tourists staying in their hotels. “The practice has been advised for the past one week and all hotels are complying with our instruction.

KARAIKAL: A 41-year-old man was sentenced to 25 years rigorous imprisonment by the Karaikal district-cum-sessions court for sexually assaulting his nine-year-old daughter in Puducherry.

Judge S Karthikeyan directed the government to provide a compensation of Rs 4 lakh to the victim besides slapping a fine of Rs 10,000 on the convict.

Special public prosecutor J Senthilraghavan said the man sexually assaulted his daughter when she was alone at their home. The victim’s mother used to leave for work early in the morning and return home only after the girl left for school. Her father took advantage of it and sexually assaulted her. He also threatened her with dire consequences if she revealed it to anyone.

The issue came to light when the minor complained of severe pain in her private parts to her mother. Her mother also found stains of blood in the girl’s inner garments and in the washroom. When pressed, the minor narrated the ordeal she had suffered at the hands of her father. Her shocked mother lodged a complaint with police against her husband. The man was booked under Section 6 (punishment for aggravated penetrative sexual assault ) of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (Pocso) Act, 2012, and Section 506 (ii) (criminal intimidation) of the IPC on October 8 last year. He was arrested and lodged in prison.

Police subjected the girl to medical examinations and the tests confirmed the charges of sexual assault. The Karaikal court concluded the trial in five months and convicted her father.

TRICHY: While saying that the custom of shaking hands to greet each other makes one prone to contracting Covid-19, Telangana governor Tamilisai Soundararajan said that it was time to realise the value of the Indian tradition. The Indian way of greeting people with folded hands has proved to be the safest way, she said.

Speaking after inaugurating the new building at Santhanam Vidhyalaya Senior Secondary School in Trichy , she said it was time that people shunned western practices.

She said that as the state health minister C Vijaya Baskar has said the situation in the state was not alarming and there was no need not to panic. However, one has to take precautions to stay safe from Covid-19.

Tamilasai said she is the youngest among incumbent governors in the country, she said hard work and honesty were the two mantras to reach greater heights.

Later in the day while addressing over 500 women at an event at Femina Hotel, she asked them to face challenges in life without succumbing to pressure.

Tamilisai also visited the Sri Ranaganathaswamy temple, Srirangam and later travelled to Theni in the evening for attending another function.

287,['11/03/2020'],Petrol Bomb Attack in Coimbatore: Petrol bomb hurled at Hindu Munnani office,"outside the Hindu Munnani office at Kattoor

COIMBATORE: Tension gripped the city after miscreants hurled a petrol bomb at Hindu Munnani office at Kattoor in the early hours of Tuesday and a seven-member gang assaulted a district secretary of SDPI at Ram Nagar in the evening.

When a functionary of Hindu Munnani opened the main gate of outfit’s head office on Range Konar Street at Kattoor around 10.45am on Tuesday, he found broken bottles with a wick. Immediately, he alerted state executive committee member Guna who rushed to the office along with HM cadres and informed police.

“Some miscreants had hurled petrol bomb at our office to create violence and disturb the peace. Our district secretary Anand was attacked by anti-elements and extremists. But police have not arrested any accused in the case so far. Police have asked us to remain calm and assured to arrest the culprits,” Guna said. He accused the state government and higher officials in the police department of not allowing the city police to take stringent action against miscreants.

“These kinds of small incidents only led to violence in 1997-98 in the city. Police should prevent such incidents. These incidents also show the inefficiency of intelligence wing of the police,” Guna said.

Hindu Munnani state president Kadeswara C Subramaniam announced a protest at Tatabad at 4pm on Wednesday to condemn the attack on Hindu Munnani functionaries and office. Alleging that it was an intelligence failure to prevent the attack on his outfit’s office, Subramaniam said the city police are showing reluctance to act against miscreants.

Deputy commissioner of police (law & order) L Balaji Saravanan, other police officials and forensic experts visited the Hindu Munnani office and conducted inquiry. Police have formed special teams to nab the miscreants.

Meanwhile, around 3.30pm, a seven-member gang assualted Social Democratic Party of India (SDPI) district secretary Mohammed Iqbal while he was on way to a bakery from his shop at Ram Nagar by walk.

Iqbal suffered a cut injury on his head in the attack. He was taken to a private hospital and later shifted to the Coimbatore Medical College and Hospital (CMCH) where he is undergoing treatment. Iqbal lodged a complaint with the Kattoor police.

Functionaries of SDPI demanded the city police to take action against those who assaulted Iqbal.

City police commissioner Sumit Sharan told reporters that the situation was under control. “We have deployed 1,000 police personnel and two companies of Rapid Action Force (RAF) in the city. So far, we have solved three cases and our special teams are working round-the-clock to arrest the miscreants who pelted petrol bomb at Hindu Munnani office and assualted SDPI district secretary,” Sumit Sharan said.

Besides these two, the city also witnessed two more incidents of stone pelting and vandalizing an auto on Monday night and in the early hours of Tuesday respectively.

Around 10.30pm on Monday, two motorcycle-borne miscreants pelted stones at the auto of Kadar Sheriff, 32, near Puttuuvikki bridge while he was on his way back home at Thiruvalluvar Nagar in Kuniyamuthur. The windshield of the auto was damaged in the attack. Kadar sheriff lodged a complaint with the Kuniyamuthur police.

In another incident, unidentified miscreants broke the windshield of an auto belonging to K Karthik, 31, a BJP cadre, around 3am on Tuesday at Ganga Nagar in Kuniyamuthur. The auto was parked outside Karthik’s house. Karthik lodged a complaint with the Kuniyamuthur police .

Two held for attack on mosque

Police on Tuesday arrested a Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) member and a BJP worker for hurling a petrol bomb at a mosque near Ganapathy here on February 5.

The accused, K Pandi alias Sadaiyandi, 41, of Periyasamy Layout at Rathinapuri, and V Akil, 23 of Rathinapuri, were detained during a vehicle check at Chinnavedampatti by Sarvanampatti police inspector V Selvaraj and his team around 6am.

On interrogation, Pandi and Akil confessed to hurling the petrol bomb at Hidayathul Sunnath Jamaath mosque at Vedambal Nagar near Ganapathy. Akil is a member of VHP and Pandi is a member BJP. The duo told police that they hurled the petrol bomb as a retaliation for the attack on Hindu Munnani district secretary Anand.

288,['11/03/2020'],"Introduce Tamil in entry level classes in KV, say parents","Trichy: Like any other city, many parents in Trichy are gearing up to try their luck at admission in Kendriya Vidyalayas at the entry level for their wards in the coming academic year. While affordable fees and good education standards have been attracting most parents to these schools, there has been a demand from a section of parents to teach Tamil language from the entry level in these schools.

There are three central schools in the district - one each in Ordnance Factory Tiruchirappalli (OFT) and Heavy Alloy Penetrator Project (HAPP) and another school in Ponmalai. As the two language policy is followed in these centrally funded schools, the medium of instruction is either Hindi or English.

“We are not against Hindi but learning mother tongue is essential for our children,” said a parent who has one of her child going to Ponmalai central school.

“We want quality education and that is ensured in the school, but that is happening at the cost of mother tongue. We can teach her Tamil by sending her for tuition but that may not be equal to learning in a school atmosphere,” said the parent.

A Marappan, former principal of KV at OFT, said that his daughter finds at a disadvantage for not having studied Tamil as it is essential to write competitive examination conducted by the state. During his tenure as principal, he had hired an ad hoc teacher to teach Tamil for interested students above Class V. But it is not taught for students at the entry level.

“There is a provision to hire a teacher to teach additional language on an ad hoc basis for students above Class V. But that largely depends on the interest of the incumbent principal,” said another former principal V Natarajan.

It may not be possible to introduce additional language at the entry level as it would be a burden for children to learn three languages, he added.

“While Hindi and Sanskrit are compulsory for students till class VIII apart from English, addition of another language will certainly be a burden for them,” said another teacher from KV Ponmalai. “After class VIII, they can choose either Hindi or Sanskrit. A hobby language, either Tamil or German, is compulsory but that would not reflect in the report card as there are no formal examination for the language,” she said.

However, having said that not having made any friends for the past one year despite you mentioning the fact that she's quite a friendly kid seems quite unnatural.I would suggest you to find out that if at all she enjoys dancing and attending class. Slowly start a conversation in a natural format about her particular batch of dance class and how she feels about her peers in that class. There might be a possibility that she might not have clicked with anyone in that class or she doesn't like taking dance classes altogether.It might be that she is dealing with some of her own personal issues which might have pumped her to be quiet in class altogether.While having a conversation just note her reactions which will give you further details as to how she feels about her environment and she herself in the class .I hope this helps.

VISAKHAPATNAM: The fever of the upcoming local body elections seems to taking a toll of the focus of students preparing for Intermediate and class 10 examinations soon.

The MPTC and ZPTC polls will be held on March 21 and counting will be taken up on March 24. For urban local bodies, polling will be held on March 23 and votes will be counted on March 27.

On the other hand, Intermediate examinations are going on, which will end on March 23. The class 10 exams will begin on March 11 and end on April 15.

This could affect preparations of a large section of students, according to a retired political science professor of Andhra University .

According to the professor, local body elections make greater noise than general or state elections. Since local body elections are contested within smaller constituencies, political parties often conduct door-to-door campaigns , he said.

“Local body elections and campaigns indirectly inject political fever in every household,” the professor said.

Moreover, teachers too will be too busy to help students in their last minute preparations as the government is going to send them on election duty, before which they will also have to undergo training sessions.

Speaking to TOI, a teacher who refused to be identified informed, “The government has announced training classes for election duty staff on March 16 and 20.”

Meanwhile, MVR Raju, professor of psychology at AU opined that in order to help students concentrate parents should refrain from discussing politics and elections at home and limit television timings. Film actors should also refrain from campaigns, Raju added.

Former Vuda chairman and MLA SK Rehman and wife Shirin Rehman had joined YSRC on Monday.

Considering that TDP has a presence in Greater Visakha region, YSRC is luring other party leaders to grab the mayor seat at any cost.

Drashini Balaraju will contest ZPTC elections in the Scheduled Tribe (ST) category from GK Veedhi in Visakha Agency. She is likely to be in the race for ZP chairperson seat as Visakhapatnam ZP is reserved for ST woman. Dadi Veerabhadra Rao, YSRC in-charge for local body elections and former MLC, said YSRC will win GVMC polls due to various welfare schemes introduced by the government. “By seeing these welfare activities several opposition leaders are joining YSRC,” he said.

When YSRC won 151 assembly seats, the city gave four seats to TDP. To offset this, YSRC general secretary Vijayasai Reddy is focusing on the city, said sources. Chief minister Y S Jaganmoan Reddy has instructed party leaders to induct any leader who comes forward to join YSRC, especially from the TDP ranks. “It seems that the CM has a plan to stymie TDP in the city,” sources said.

VISAKHAPATNAM: Scare of the novel coronavirus (Covid-19) took a toll on city’s Holi celebrations this year. While people did celebrate in the festival of colours, the numbers were far less than usual. Many schools and colleges also remained open.

Holi in Visakhapatnam is usually celebrated with Holi-bashes and rain dances on the Beach Road. Event managers plan grand programmes for over a week. In 2018, a Spain-style La Tomatina festival was also celebrated.

However, not this time. While people largely kept away from celebrations, the police did not give special permissions for events. Celebrations were largely limited to some hotels.

Speaking to TOI, Ch Adinarayana, ACP (traffic) said that the police did not notice large crowds celebrating this year. Generally, the police deploy special teams, “but this year we did not feel any pressure as there were no big crowds on the beach,” Adinarayana said.

K Rama Rao, the owner of a departmental store at Sivaji Park said that instead of buying colours and water guns, people are buying hand sanitizers and masks.

Meanwhile, Parvati, who sells eggs at the beach, said that while she sold over 500 eggs last year, this year she sold less than a hundred eggs.

VISAKHAPATNAM: When 27-year-old Ankita Muwal was diagnosed with Hidradentitis Suppurativa (HS) — a rare skin condition that causes painful lumps under the skin, little did she know that her path to recovery will become an inspiration.

It was while she was working at a pharmaceutical firm in Hyderabad, that she first noticed the symptoms. Subsequently, her condition worsened. The pain became severe and she was unable to perform daily tasks.

The doctors she went to told her that HS, also called ‘acne inversa’, was incurable. The wounds started getting deeper and the pain began taking a toll on her mental health.

Speaking to TOI, Ankita said, “I tried all suitable medication, from allopathic to homeopathic. Some dermatologists prescribed antibiotics, steroids and some even prescribed harmful retinoids. At a point, I was also prescribed biologics which are not only extremely expensive, but also cause pain and come with side effects. I felt rejected hopeless and alone.”

However, the young woman has now managed to heal herself after educating herself on holistic health, fitness and nutrition. According to Ankita, it was this that helped her understand the basics of the body. “The deep, painful would and zits which seemed impossible to heal have healed miraculously,” she said.

According to Ankita, she was able to reverse this condition by adopting a ‘sustainable lifestyle’. Having transformed herself, Ankita is now on a mission to empower a thousand more people and help them follow a holistic lifestyle.

“I intend to educate people on lifestyle diseases through an e-learning platform by which people around the world can heal themselves. I am also creating a YouTube channel to create more awareness about HS,” Ankita said.

A stability for the market on a sustained basis, however, could be at least two-three months in the futures, they said.On Monday, the sensex — spooked by a global sell-off due to the spread of coronavirus and crashing crude oil prices — recorded a 1,942-point fall, its biggest ever, to close at 35,635. As a result, over Rs 7 lakh crore worth of investors’ wealth was wiped out in a single session. In addition to the twin impact of the deadly virus and sliding crude prices, D-Street also had to grapple with fears of financial instability in India due to the failure of Yes Bank, once the fourth largest private sector lender, that was put under RBI’s operative restrictions last week.On Tuesday, while the Indian markets were closed for trading, around the world markets were stable with mostly positive biases. Nikkei in Japan closed nearly 1% higher, while the Hang Seng in Hong Kong was up 1.4%. In Europe, UK’s FTSE managed to end flat at 0.1% down, while Germany’s Dax closed 1.4% lower.Across the Atlantic, the Dow Jones index, after an over 7% slide on Monday that also saw a 15-minute suspension of trade due to its hitting the lower circuit breaker, was up about a percent, while Ibovespa in Brazil, that lost over 12% on Monday, was up 3%.Market players here feel a bounce-back after a session of furious selling is due on Wednesday on D-Street with oil marketing companies, which stand to benefit from the crashing crude oil prices, leading the up-move. However, they warned that inventory losses of these companies could be substantial in the initial weeks unless they do not reduce petro product prices.In the bonds market, the action is expected to be around those issued by banks that are called additional tier-1 (AT1) and tier-2 papers. Last week, the RBI had decided to extinguish AT1 bonds issued by Yes Bank as part of the lender’s restructuring plan, which has hit several mutual funds, insurance companies, pension funds and high net worth individuals. Such bonds issued by other banks are witnessing a price slide, which is expected to continue, bond players said.",business,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74568088,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-39240,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/dalal-street-may-stabilise-today-if-global-markets-remain-in-green/articleshow/74568083.cms
303,['11/03/2020'],Mumbai: No bail for 'wife-swapper' businessman three months after arrest,"Representative image

MUMBAI: Three months after a 46-year-old city-based businessman was arrested for indulging in ""wife-swapping"" and allowing three of his friends to rape his 39-year-old wife on different occasions, a sessions court has rejected the businessman's bail plea. The court observed that it appeared that the businessman had used his wife to fulfil his fantasies and made her a victim of his lust in ways that no ordinary husband would have.

Referring to the woman's allegations, the court said that these things show it was the husband had initially made his wife watch porn videos and then made her have sex with two of the other accused. ""Later, he appears to have made her keep relations with Tarun [name changed],"" the court said.

The woman had opposed the man's bail plea through her lawyers Swapana Kode and Shruti Mundargi. Kode also explained that the FIR was lodged more than two years after the first alleged incident in 2017 as the woman was not in the right mental frame. She said that after the woman lodged the complaint, the police sat over it.

The court refuted the man's defence that his wife had chosen to be with other men as she was dissatisfied with him. It observed that in comparison to a woman, the man's nature is generally more aggressive, particularly in respect to sexual equations. ""If the wife is not satisfied with her husband, as alleged by him, she could have chosen her secret way to satisfy herself and could not have told her husband to find another man for her,"" the court said.

The court found that he had even made a video of her and accused Tarun's relations. ""This shows that either it was the fantasy of the husband to satisfy his lust or it was a tact to keep the wife under pressure. Had it been only her wish and he had consented to do so, he could not have taken their video,"" the court said.

The court also rejected Tarun's bail plea. On Monday, one of the two absconding accused was arrested.

The FIR filed in December said he indulged in swapping wives with his friends.

MUMBAI: A special Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) court on Monday convicted and sentenced a 49-year-old maulvi (religious teacher) to six years' rigorous imprisonment for sexually abusing his 9-year-old student several times over a month in 2018.

The matter came to light when the child confided in her classmates. The children got together and wrote a letter to their class teacher about how he was attacking the survivor. During a school meeting, a teacher informed the child's mother. Special public prosecutor Geeta Sharma said among those who deposed were the child, her friend, teacher and mother. The mother told the court that after the teacher informed her on March 28, 2018, her husband and she confronted the accused. The child had identified him from among three teachers present.

An FIR was lodged and the accused was arrested . The accused claimed that he was falsely implicated as there was a dispute between the child's parents and him over her studies. The court had rejected his bail pleas. The accused was also fined Rs 15,000, which will be given to the survivor as compensation.

306,['11/03/2020'],Global contagion sinks Kolkata foreign exchange business,"KOLKATA: Foreign exchange trade in Kolkata has come to a grinding halt with the coronavirus outbreak prompting widespread travel bans and cancellation of international flights. There is little or almost no demand for the US dollar, euro, Thai baht and UK pound and units registering minor transactions have made use of sanitizers mandatory for those handling currency and are demanding to see the self-reporting forms issued to arriving flyers by the health ministry.The drop in sale of foreign currency is more than 90%, says Anil Punjabi, chairman of Travel Agents Federation (east) and director of Ares Travels that has been in the money-changing business for the past 15 years.“It has been 20 days since we have had any buyers. Indians and NRIs are also getting rid of foreign currency. Earlier, they would hold on to foreign currency but now, they don’t want to since they are unsure of the future,” said Punjabi.Debasish Dutt, director of the 133-year-old RN Dutt & Sons, says there has been very little trade in the past month. “In my career of 22 years, I have never seen such a slump in business. I will put the dip to 70%. We are registering insignificant number of queries from travellers and very little currency exchange is happening. Some are approaching us for encashment. Our front office people are using sanitizers to deal with such clients,” he said. Biswajit Dutta, vice president of Edix Cash, earlier known as Centrum Direct Limited, claimed there was “at least a 50% dip in business” at his outlet while Subir Kumar De, general manager of Vicky Tourism Private limited, said the drop was 70%“The number of people returning to Kolkata from abroad has gone down drastically. In the past 15 days, we have had no foreigners coming over to exchange currency. For regular customers with no known symptoms, we are exchanging currency only after they have shown us their self-reporting forms issued by the ministry of health and family welfare,” said De.Biswajit Das, zonal head east of Zenith Leisure Holidays Limited, said there are hardly any enquires for foreign exchange and his unit it only encashing currency from travellers who have returned to India before the outbreak. “Even in their cases, we have their departure tickets and are well aware of when they returned. Now, we are also advising people to use travel cards instead of currency,” said Das. To be on the safe side, the procured currency is also being stored kept in separate plastic packets. “Those who work at the counter have been told to maintain a minimum distance from the person who comes to exchange the currency,” Das added.Instead of procuring dollars, pounds and euros from travellers, most units are now relying on banks to get their stock of international currency. “We understand that the situation is tricky there as well.

The Chakravuyha: How to go beyond the doors

‘Customers are selective about flavours and the type of coal used in the hookah pot’

Will come down heavily on offenders, smoke at illegal hookah bars at your own risk: Police

How hookah became illegal in city:

Police raid in illegal Hookah parlours in 2 years :

Male 40% Female 60% :

A ride up the elevator to an unmarked floor leads you to a dark alleyway. There’s not a soul in sight; no signboards or door numbers; no activity whatsoever. Soon, you see a thick cloud of smoke with an unmistakable sweet note of green apple wafting out from under a door, which is shut and has a heavy lock outside. There’s no sign of life, but if you strain your ears hard enough, you’ll hear the faint thump of music. Sounds like a scene from a horror film? No, it’s just a scene outside one of the many underground hookah bars in Hyderabad. Once you get through the door (that’s a skill in itself), it’s a completely different world inside. It takes a while for your eyes to get adjusted to the dim mood lighting, but once they do, it all becomes apparent. there are smoke pipes, colourful pots, sound of bubbling water and smoking hot coal — all assembled on tables. groups of people sit around, some puffing away while others eagerly await their turn. “Welcome to the best underground hookah bar in the city of Nawabs,” our host exclaims, laughing at our flummoxed faces.Underground hookah parlours have gained popularity ever since a blanket ban on smoking under the Prohibition of Smoking in Public Places Rules, 2008 and COTPA was imposed. As the rules became even more stringent after the amendment of the Prohibition of Smoking in Public Places Act, 2008 in July 2017 issued by Ministry of Health and Family Welfare that states that no tobacco products can be consumed in public places, serving hookah in cafes became illegal and warranted severe penalties. But in Hyderabad at least, hookah-loving youth have found a way to puff away. Though the city police have in the past conducted several raids on hookah joints in the city, they have, mysteriously, managed to thrive. “And that’s because the game has changed over the years,” say regulars. Today, hookah bars are inconspicuous; only loyal and regular customers whom the management trusts gain entry to these joints; strangers are not welcome unless introduced by a trusted, regular client —all this to avoid complications like raids and arrests,” says our source, who managed to get us an entry into a hidden hookah parlour right in the heart of Banjara Hills .Talking to Hyderabad Times, Inayat Khan, who works at another underground hookah bar in Jubliee Hills , says, “For the past eight years, we have had customers who often visit us for hookah. But in 2017, police asked us to stop serving hookah. Now, we are only allowed to serve food and beverages. Our regular customers (between the age group of 20-35), who used to smoke hookah kept calling us and demanding for it. So, we started serving hookah again, but on the sly. It’s restricted to our special customers only. To get inside our hookah bar, customers need to know the exact location. Once they arrive, we identify them and ascertain their identity with the help of cameras.”Just like the dens of drug lords and mafias in films, these cafes too are tricky to enter. Most of these joints, located on the top floor with an open roof. There is no sign board, no decoration, and usually no sign of life, so they go unnoticed by casual visitors. “The owners of these cafes also control the elevator, so an individual who isn’t a known customer can’t get access to their floor,” says a source from a Banjara Hills joint. If you choose to use the shady, under lit staircase to reach the floor, you will still be left high and dry, unless you know how to get in. “To an unsuspecting individual, the door looks locked from outside but one who knows, knows how to getbeyond the doors,” explains Amzad Ahmed, another worker at a hookah parlour. “Earlier, we had a code system where our clients had to knock hard thrice and then once, softly. But that became common knowledge, and everyone gained access so we had to scrap it. Now, we have a new system in place, which includes a CCTV camera in front of the main door so we can see who is entering. We also have the contact numbers of our regular customers and they usually call us once they are at the door. We check if they are the right people with the help of the monitor and only then we open the door.”‘Underground’ they may be, but all these places are spacious and can accommodate up to a 100 people easily. Surya Kiran, a 22-year-old student who’s a regular at a Punjagutta hookah bar, says, “I still remember the first time I was taken to this fancy hookah place. It looked so shady from outside. We had to access it via a dark stairwell that smelled musty. It was scary and if I wasn’t with friends, I’d have never ventured in. But once I got inside, I was amazed at how plush the place was. From starters to milkshakes, everything is served along with hookah. Now I hangout here quite often.” Vijay Anirudh, another college-goer adds, “The owners make the rules. If you have five friends and only two of them want to smoke hookah, one needs to order at least two hookah pots. But you can sit and chill here in peace,because these people are always alert and ready. If police is anywhere around, they hide all the pots immediately. These are quite organised that way.”After all the trouble they go through to gain entry, hookah connoisseurs are not about to settle for just about anything. They have specific demands about everything from flavour to the kind of charcoal, say cafe owners. grape, kiwi, orange, mint to strawberry flavour… you name it and these cafes have it. The coal is of two types — natural and regular. Amzad says, “Most people prefer natural coal as it lasts longer and gives a clean hit that does not interfere with the flavours. It is also assumed thatnatural coal doesn’t affect one’s health.” Though natural coal costs more, it seems people are ready to shell out the extra money. A hookah pot with natural coal starts from `1000 and goes upto `1400, depending on flavours chosen but hookah with regular coal costs `700. The youngsters always find a way to spend their time in these parlours. Ratan Raju, a city-based businessman says, “Three years ago , there were multiple hookah cafes attached to coffee shops in the city. There were close to 50 hookah places in Jubliee Hils and Banjara Hills alone. But after the implementation of the ban, the number has decreased drastically. My friends still visit a few private cafes which still serve hookah. All these places only allow you if you are their registered customer.”When contacted, Radhakishan Rao, DCP of City Task Force wing said, “In the last two years, we have filed 113 cases on individuals running hookah parlours. Not only in Jubilee and Banjara Hills, we also banned places in Madhapur, Kompally and few other areas in the old city. We are leaving no stone unturned in eliminating this hookah culture from the city.” Admitting that they are indeed aware of the underground hookah parlour scene, Rao added, “Organisers are running these cafes even after we have raided them. We have arrested the owners who are running these cafes in the past too and will do so again, if we find any such cafes in the city. Customers also beware. if anyone is found inside such cafes, they too will be detained immediately. We request the public to alert the police if they come across such illegal cafes. We guarantee that the identity of our informers will not be disclosed.”2 Years: .In July 2017, Hyderabad City Police announced a total ban of hookah parlours in the city as per the order issued by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare by amending the Prohibition of Smoking in Public Places Act, 2008113 Cases registered: According to Hyderabad police officials, a whopping 113 cases have been registered against hookah parlours, who have been operating illegally in the twin citiesAccording to those who run hookah establishments, the number of women who frequent underground hookah bars is marginally higher than men",hyderabad,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/what-ban-behind-the-smokescreen-its-hookahbad/articleshow/74571078.cms
308,['11/03/2020'],Trinamool plans to connect with old-timers ahead of civic elections,"Representative image

KOLKATA: Trinamool Congress has planned a unique public outreach programme after ‘Didi Ke Bolo’ and ‘Banglar Gorbo Mamata ’ to win back old-timers who have distanced themselves from the party. The exercise will begin on March 15 from ward 73, on the home turf of the chief minister’s Bhowanipore assembly seat where TMC trailed in the 2019 Lok Sabha polls.

The purpose is to activate TMC sympathisers and activists who have chosen to opt out of active politics. “There are many Trinamool activists who have become less active or inactive these days. They may have reservations about party functioning and also with the new entrants. I am not saying that old is gold and the entire fault lies with new-generation leaders. But we want to give these Trinamool old-timers a chance to pour out their hearts at a meeting scheduled at Jai Hind Hall on March 15,” Trinamool Bengal president Subrata Bakshi said on Tuesday.

Bakshi, prodded by Trinamool chief Mamata Banerjee , wants to take these disgruntled sympathisers along in the battle ahead. Trinamool seniors plan to hold such meetings across the city based on the experience of the March 15 meeting. The target is to reach as many as 10 lakh people in Kolkata.

Kolkata mayor Firhad Hakim, Trinamool councillor from ward 73 Ratan Malakar and councillor from Kolkata Port area Md Anwar were present at Tuesday’s informal discussion. Bakshi made no bones about the fact before the media that TMC lost 18 Lok Sabha seats mainly because of “organisational shortcomings”.

Bakshi, while elaborating on the programme, said: “We could not reach out to people at the desired level. Learning it from the Lok Sabha polls, we have taken up a slew of organisational programmes such as ‘Didi Ke Bolo’ and ‘Banglar Gorbo Mamata’ to plug this gap. As on date, we could connect with 36 lakh people in West Bengal. The programme on March 15 is part of the outreach programme.”

Trinamool seniors will also hold meetings with party organisers and inform them about the various welfare schemes of the Mamata Banerjee government, which they can inform people during these meetings.

“We have done many things in the Kolkata Municipal Corporation area and are still at work. Yet, we couldn’t get the support of a section despite our good work. We want to reach out to them and try to identify where we have failed,” the Trinamool Bengal president said.

309,['11/03/2020'],Ex-mayor Bikash is Left-Congress’ RS nominee for 5th seat from Bengal,"File photo of Bikash Bhattacharya

KOLKATA: Left and Congress are fielding senior Calcutta high court lawyer and former mayor Bikash Bhattacharya for the fifth Rajya Sabha seat from Bengal, CPM general secretary Sitaram Yechury said in Delhi on Tuesday.

Bhattacharya is likely to file his nomination on Thursday. “I will be filing my nomination on March 12 or 13,” he said.

Bhattacharya’s nomination as a Left-Congress joint candidate marks a departure from the past when Congress candidates, namely Abhishek Manu Singhvi and Pradip Bhattacharya , made it to Upper House with the support of Trinamool Congress. Congress’s hand-holding with Left in fielding Bhattacharya for the RS seat is likely to firm up the understanding between the two parties in the run-up to the 2021 assembly polls.

Bhattacharya, primarily a CPM leader, has broken barriers over a host of issues from taking up the Saradha Ponzi scam in the Supreme Court to speaking in support of civil liberty and environment. The high court lawyer didn’t hesitate to move Congress leader Abdul Mannan’s petition against the Saradha scam and also joined issues with political leaders and members of civil society under the Save Democracy umbrella.

Bhattacharya had filed his nomination as a Left candidate for Rajya Sabha three years ago in 2017. But the Election Commission found gaps in his nomination paper and cancelled it. In 2019, he contested on the CPM symbol from the Jadavpur Lok Sabha seat, but lost to TMC’s Mimi Chakrabarty.

Going by MLA count, neither Congress nor Left has the strength to win the fifth Rajya Sabha seat from Bengal when the other four are likely to go with Trinamool. The Bengal assembly now has 293 elected members of the total 294, following the demise of a member. The quota for getting elected for each candidate is thus 49 in terms of first preferential votes. The first preferential votes of Congress and Left taken together is much more than the remaining first preferential votes of Trinamool after getting four of its candidates through.

ODLABARI (JALPAIGURI): Yet again, some 100 vultures were spotted in Dooars, bringing cheers to nature lovers and forest workers. The birds were seen at Jalpaiguri’s Mal along railway tracks on the banks of the river Ghish. Environmentalists and forest staff said vultures of the Himalayan Grifan species have been spotted in Odlabari located on the banks of the Ghish river.

Locals said a cow carcass was lying on railway tracks passing along the banks of the river. This carcass drew some 100 vultures to the spot, locals added. As news about the vultures spread, members of an Odlabari NGO and staff from the Chel and Targhera forest ranges rushed to the spot.

“It was a great sight to see,” said local environmentalist Nafzar Ali. Tamal Mukherjee, ranger of the Chel forest range said, “We went to the spot on hearing of the vultures. We took steps to remove the carcass of the cow from the railway tracks. We have a bad experience of several vultures being killed under the wheels of a train at Gulma. Those vultures too were similarly drawn to the spot by the carcass of a cow. We also requested authorities of Odlabari power station to switch off power supply to the overhead electric wires.”

Field director of the Rajabhatkhawa Vulture centre Shyamma Chowdhury said, “All these vultures belong to the Great Himalayan Grifan species. Staff from the Chel Range and the Mal Wildlife Squad have started monitoring the vultures’ movement there.”

Our regular customers (between the age group of 20-35), who used to smoke hookah kept calling us and demanding for it. So, we started serving hookah again, but on the sly. It’s restricted to our special customers only. To get inside our hookah bar, customers need to know the exact location. Once they arrive, we identify them and ascertain their identity with the help of cameras.”Just like the dens of drug lords and mafias in films, these cafes too are tricky to enter. Most of these joints, located on the top floor with an open roof. There is no sign board, no decoration, and usually no sign of life, so they go unnoticed by casual visitors. “The owners of these cafes also control the elevator, so an individual who isn’t a known customer can’t get access to their floor,” says a source from a Banjara Hills joint. If you choose to use the shady, under lit staircase to reach the floor, you will still be left high and dry, unless you know how to get in. “To an unsuspecting individual, the door looks locked from outside but one who knows, knows how to getbeyond the doors,” explains Amzad Ahmed, another worker at a hookah parlour. “Earlier, we had a code system where our clients had to knock hard thrice and then once, softly. But that became common knowledge, and everyone gained access so we had to scrap it. Now, we have a new system in place, which includes a CCTV camera in front of the main door so we can see who is entering. We also have the contact numbers of our regular customers and they usually call us once they are at the door. We check if they are the right people with the help of the monitor and only then we open the door.”‘Underground’ they may be, but all these places are spacious and can accommodate up to a 100 people easily. Surya Kiran, a 22-year-old student who’s a regular at a Punjagutta hookah bar, says, “I still remember the first time I was taken to this fancy hookah place. It looked so shady from outside. We had to access it via a dark stairwell that smelled musty. It was scary and if I wasn’t with friends, I’d have never ventured in. But once I got inside, I was amazed at how plush the place was. From starters to milkshakes, everything is served along with hookah. Now I hangout here quite often.” Vijay Anirudh, another college-goer adds, “The owners make the rules. If you have five friends and only two of them want to smoke hookah, one needs to order at least two hookah pots. But you can sit and chill here in peace,because these people are always alert and ready. If police is anywhere around, they hide all the pots immediately. These are quite organised that way.”After all the trouble they go through to gain entry, hookah connoisseurs are not about to settle for just about anything. They have specific demands about everything from flavour to the kind of charcoal, say cafe owners. grape, kiwi, orange, mint to strawberry flavour… you name it and these cafes have it. The coal is of two types — natural and regular. Amzad says, “Most people prefer natural coal as it lasts longer and gives a clean hit that does not interfere with the flavours. It is also assumed thatnatural coal doesn’t affect one’s health.” Though natural coal costs more, it seems people are ready to shell out the extra money. A hookah pot with natural coal starts from `1000 and goes upto `1400, depending on flavours chosen but hookah with regular coal costs `700. The youngsters always find a way to spend their time in these parlours. Ratan Raju, a city-based businessman says, “Three years ago , there were multiple hookah cafes attached to coffee shops in the city. There were close to 50 hookah places in Jubliee Hils and Banjara Hills alone. But after the implementation of the ban, the number has decreased drastically. My friends still visit a few private cafes which still serve hookah. All these places only allow you if you are their registered customer.”When contacted, Radhakishan Rao, DCP of City Task Force wing said, “In the last two years, we have filed 113 cases on individuals running hookah parlours. Not only in Jubilee and Banjara Hills, we also banned places in Madhapur, Kompally and few other areas in the old city. We are leaving no stone unturned in eliminating this hookah culture from the city.” Admitting that they are indeed aware of the underground hookah parlour scene, Rao added, “Organisers are running these cafes even after we have raided them. We have arrested the owners who are running these cafes in the past too and will do so again, if we find any such cafes in the city. Customers also beware. if anyone is found inside such cafes, they too will be detained immediately. We request the public to alert the police if they come across such illegal cafes. We guarantee that the identity of our informers will not be disclosed.”2 Years: .In July 2017, Hyderabad City Police announced a total ban of hookah parlours in the city as per the order issued by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare by amending the Prohibition of Smoking in Public Places Act, 2008113 Cases registered: According to Hyderabad police officials, a whopping 113 cases have been registered against hookah parlours, who have been operating illegally in the twin citiesAccording to those who run hookah establishments, the number of women who frequent underground hookah bars is marginally higher than men",entertainment,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74570707,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-49575/74570707.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/events/hyderabad/what-ban-behind-the-smokescreen-its-hookahbad/articleshow/74570707.cms

BENGALURU: Three more cases of Covid-19 infections from Bengaluru were confirmed on Tuesday, taking the total in the state to four.

The new cases include the 47-year-old wife and 13-year-old daughter of Karnataka's first positive case, a software engineer from Dell. The girl is Karnataka's first paediatric case. Unlike the techie who had returned from the United States, his wife and daughter had no travel history to any country.

The state's fourth patient is a 50-year-old software engineer of Mindtree who returned to Bengaluru from the US via London on March 8. He reported at Rajiv Gandhi Institute of Chest Diseases (RGICD) on Monday.

Including his wife and daughter, 12 persons who were in contact with the Mindtree techie are under observation. None of them has been admitted to the hospital.

All the four confirmed patients are now in the isolation ward at RGICD and their condition is said to be stable.

A colleague of the Dell techie who had travelled with him from the United States and was admitted to RGICD has tested negative for the infection. In all, 2,666 primary and secondary contacts of the techie's family are on the health and family welfare department's radar.

Meanwhile, a 24-year-old engineer, the first Covid-19 case of Telangana who worked and lived in Bengaluru, has recovered, a minister said.

According to a media release from the health and family welfare department on Tuesday, 25 samples came negative for Covid-19. Fourteen more samples of suspected patients have been taken for testing, said medical education minister Dr K Sudhakar.

Currently, there are nine patients admitted to hospitals across the state: Four confirmed and two suspected cases at RGICD, one each in Dakshina Kannada, Bagalkot and Hassan hospitals.

Till date, 95,151 passengers have been screened in at KIA airport, Mangaluru airport and seaports of Mangaluru and Karwar.

BENGALURU: In an expletive-laden faceoff in the legislative assembly , former speaker KR Ramesh Kumar and medical education minister K Sudhakar locked horns on Tuesday with both abusing each other in unparliamentary language.

The war of words between the two started when Sudhakar accused the speaker's chair - then occupied by Kumar - of meting out injustice to him and 16 other MLAs, who switched sides from Congress and JD(S) to BJP. He was referring to Kumar's decision to disqualify them.

Kumar took strong objection when Sudhakar began reading out the Supreme Court's observations on the speaker's role while upholding their disqualification.

Former speaker threatens to quit after fracas

When members of the treasury bench, including Sudhakar, tried to shout him down, Kumar protested, resulting in a war of words.

""This chair meted out injustice to us. Our political career would have been over. A conspiracy was hatched to finish us off politically,"" Sudhakar said.

When Sudhakar persisted on discussing the issue, Kumar sought the intervention of law and parliamentary affairs minister JC Madhuswamy. ""Will (Madhuswamy) you approve your minister's conduct? Will you allow a discussion on the speaker's decision and subsequent SC judgement,"" Kumar asked.

When Madhuswamy did not react, Kumar lost his cool and rushed to the well of the house. Both Sudhakhar and Kumar used unparliamentary words against each other and addressed each other in the singular. Ministers Ramesh Jarkiholi, Anand Singh and Shivaram Hebbar, who were also disqualified by Kumar, rushed to the support of Sudhakar. ""We need to debate this issue and expose the conspiracy behind our disqualification,"" Jarkiholi said.

The house descended into pandemonium with members on both sides shouting at the other. ""If this is the kind of debate and language being used in the house, I don't want to continue as a member. I will quit,"" Kumar said and left the house.

As allegations and counter-allegations flew, Congress MLA Shivanand Patil, who was in the chair, adjourned the house for 15 minutes. But the pandemonium continued when the house reconvened. Opposition leader Siddaramaiah sought to move a privilege motion against Sudhakar, while ruling party MLAs demanded Kumar's suspension. As both sides stuck to their demands, the house was adjourned for the day.

Siddaramaiah told reporters that Sudhakar's remark against Kumar was uncalled for and it amounts to breach of privilege of the house. ""We will press for a privilege motion on Wednesday,"" he said, denying Kumar used unparliamentary words against Sudhakar. The minister said he, too, would move a privilege motion against Kumar.

315,['11/03/2020'],Beary to be third language in Karnataka schools?,"Representative image

MANGALURU: Beary is set to be introduced as an optional third language across state schools from the 2020-21 academic year. The Karnataka Beary Sahitya Academy is in the process of creating a textbook for students of Class 6, which will be vetted by state authorities.

Beary, which traces it origins 1,200 years ago to Muslim traders, combines Malayalam and Tulu with a strong Arabic influence. Written in the Kannada script, the language has snatches of Kannada and Tamil as well. It is the second most spoken language after Tulu in Dakshina Kannada; the Muslim Byari community makes up an estimated 80% of Tulu Nadu's Muslim population.

Committee working on Beary text

""It is our aim to introduce Beary language for students of Class 6 to start with from the coming academic year and we will work towards that,"" Karnataka Beary Sahitya Academy president Rahim Uchil told mediapersons on Tuesday. A 13-member committee is drawing up the contents of the textbook which will be further scrutinised by a five-member panel. The Department of State Educational Research and Training (DSERT) will then finalise the textbook. Textbook committee members Poornima, Hamza Malar and Flora Castelino were present at the meet.

The academy will work with DSERT to train teachers to teach the language in Kannada script. ""Beary can be learnt by a student who knows Kannada and taught by Kannada teachers. Members of Moya and Thiya community and those speaking Malame, a sub-Beary language, can now learn it in a formal academic set-up,"" Uchil said. The textbook has completed the groundwork for the contents, he said, which includes topics such as communal amity in Manjeshwar and the life of Padma Shri awardee Harekala Hajabba.

With Italy registering 97 deaths on March 9, more government restrictions, especially in travelling and movement, have been placed from Tuesday.The students are a worried lot given the shortage of masks and restricted entry at supermarkets. From Tuesday, the Italian government has also asked everyone to confine themselves at home while shutting down all public places.Few Telugu students told TOI that hospitals were reluctant to give ‘fit’ certificates and there was no provision to check those without symptoms, making it even more difficult for them to return. Sources said that Indian embassy authorities too are insisting on fit certificates to be considered for evacuation.Badarinath Gella from Kodad in Suryapet district of Telangana has just completed his engineering degree from the 931-year-old University of Bologna. Speaking to TOI from Italy, he said, “Over 30 of us are stranded here.

BELAGAVI: With Covid-19 leading to a steep fall in chicken prices over unfounded fears of transmission, a desperate poultry farmer in Gokak buried alive a truckload of chickens on his farm, saying he was facing massive losses. He shot a video of the gruesome burial which has gone viral, and ironically, is being passed off as culling to prevent the spread of coronavirus Najeer Ahmed Makandar loaded nearly 6,000 chickens, all about a month old, onto a truck and dumped the live birds into a large pit at Nulsoor in Belagavi ’s Gokak taluk on Monday. “I was left with no option,” the 47-year-old told. “I have spent nearly Rs 6 lakh to rear these birds. Their food and medicine cost a lot.” Chickens are sold when they are between 42 and 45 days old.“Before the coronavirus scare , live chicken was selling at Rs 50-70 a kilo which was profitable. The prevailing price is Rs 5 to 10. A live chicken weighs up to 2.5kg which would give me a maximum of Rs 25 for a bird. I cannot sell at such a loss, nor can I maintain the birds,” he said. Makandar went on to shoot a video to make consumers aware of the plight of farmers but it is now fuelling rumours of culling over the virus scare.Sources in the poultry industry said several farmers were staring at huge losses after investing lakhs of rupees as the demand has been plunging for a month following panic over Covid-19, which has not showed any link to fowl so far. Farmers in Belagavi, which contributes nearly 10% of chickens in the state, have taken a major hit, the sources said.The input cost for producing a kg of chicken is about Rs 75. “Imagine the plight of farmers who are forced to sell birds for Rs 5 and Rs 10 a kilo. If this situation continues, many farmers may have to look for another livelihood,” said an industry expert.Madhukar Pawar, general manager of Quality Animal Feeds Private Limited, said Belagavi produces 60,000kg to 80,000kg of chickens every month and the loss is massive. “Chickens are being sold at Rs 5 and many live chicken trading companies are unable to pay farmers. My company has 1,500 employees and more than 1,000 farmers are dependent on us. This month we have managed to pay them but it will be difficult from next month,” Pawar said.Paward added that while his company used to sell 30 lakh kg of live chicken every month, the figure has halved now. “While farmers are suffering, meat traders are still selling chicken at Rs 70 to 120.”",hubballi,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74568273,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-169547,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hubballi/coronavirus-scare-in-karnataka-as-panic-sends-prices-crashing-farmer-buries-6000-chickens-alive/articleshow/74568262.cms

Scindia, along with his supporters, is expected to join the BJP and may get a Rajya Sabha ticket from Madhya Pradesh, where election will be held on three seats.

Fifty-one of these 55 seats from 17 states are falling vacant on different dates in April due to retirement of sitting members, while the rest are already vacant due to resignation of members.

The terms of the members who had resigned in the recent past were also ending in April.

Counting will be held on the evening of March 26, an hour after the conclusion of polls.

Thirty-four years since it was formed, the National Democratic Front of Boroland ( NDFB ) finally disbanded itself at two different locations in the last 24 hours. This was done in accordance with a clause in the memorandum of settlement (MoS) signed by the outfit’s four factions and other Bodo stakeholders with the government on January 27.

The outfit, which became one the biggest and deadliest militant outfits in the NE region, is the third such armed group and the second one in Assam to have disbanded itself after signing a peace deal. Mizo National Army — the armed wing of Mizo National Front (MNF) — was disbanded after the signing of the Mizo Accord four decades ago. In 2002, Bodo Liberation Tigers (BLT) ceased to exist after signing the second Bodo Accord.

On January 27, the four NDFB factions set aside their differences and unanimously resolved to unite for implementing all the clauses of the accord. While three NDFB factions — Saoraigwra, Ranjan Daimari and Dhiren Boro — declared the end of NDFB at Udalguri on Monday, the fourth one, NDFB (Progressive) led by Gobinda Basumatry, announced its disbanding at a ceremonial function at Serfanguri on Tuesday.

“To find a solution to the political, economic, social and cultural issues of the Bodo people, the Bodo Security Force was formed in 1986. It was renamed as NDFB in 1994. Our fight has finally come to an end after 34 years of armed struggle from within and outside the country… from Nepal, Bangladesh, Myanmar and Bhutan. We believe that the NDFB movement has been a successful one and so we are disbanding the group,” NDFB (P) leader Gobinda Basumatry said.

351,['11/03/2020'],"Kolkata: Cops book 336 bikers on Dol, Bansdroni sees most arrests","Representative image

KOLKATA: The city police took action against 336 bikers on Monday by setting up over 700 pickets across the city. In a bid to rein in errant bikers on Dol and Holi, cops carried out special drives across the city to nab the offenders.

But the most problematic zone was the south suburban Kolkata. In almost a repeat of Diwali arrests for the past two years, the maximum number of disorderly conduct arrests came from this region with cops arresting 129 people from the area.

The most important stretch of the crackdown was between Naktala and Garia, the naka on Boral Main Road yielded 20 punitive actions. Most of them were riding helmetless and had more than two people on their bike.

On Holi, cops carried out another 117 arrests, with north division arresting 52 people, which was the highest, followed by central and south suburban police divisions.

Areas in central Kolkata such as Entally, Posta and Burrabazar, too, had large number of offenders. The area witnessed punitive action against 20-25 bikers at Ananda Palit Road-Sunari Mohan Avenue crossing, Kalakar Street-Hariram Goenka Street and CR Avenue-Ganesh Chandra Avenue crossing. Shyambazar and Karunamoyee bridge at Putiyari, however, witnessed seven and five prosecutions respectively.

All FIRs were registered under the Motor Vehicles Act. Merely eight bikers and motorists were found riding under the influence of alcohol unlike 39 last year. However, 217 were caught for not using helmets and 79 were hauled up since their pillion riders did not wear helmets.

Cops said that among the worst affected stretches were Entally, Bansdroni, Bowbazar besides Burtolla (that witnessed a culpable homicide) and Ekbalpore.

Police added that specific trouble spots are identified each year and cops are instructed to carry out checks in at least three points in each of the traffic guards, up from only one on a normal working day or two on a raid day. “We had instructed our men to focus on the job, despite jibes and even veiled threats. We did not even spare locals,” said an officer.

“People driving drunk has now become all too common and hence we changed our strategy this year round and checked every youth on a bike or car. All local police stations worked in tandem to provide us the necessary back-up. In the Howrah Bridge and Jorabagan traffic guards alone, we have recorded 85 cases of drunk driving this Holi month. Till last year, it was less than 25,” said an officer at Lalbazar.

352,['11/03/2020'],GRP strives to make train ride safer on Park Circus stretch in Kolkata,"A liquor den near Park Circus station being destroyed

KOLKATA: Alarmed by back-to-back attacks on women on a 4-km train route between Sealdah and Park Circus—the latest one being flagged by a woman journalist on Monday —senior officers at Sealdah and Ballygunge GRP on Tuesday launched a joint drive against trouble-mongers living by the tracks.

On the very first day, around 12 people were detained and an illicit liquor den was destroyed. “This is going to be a sustained drive . We have formed a team, comprising officers from Sealdah and Ballygunge GRP, who will work in coordination with RPF and cops from the local police station to stop crime against women and check criminal activities in this part,” said Badana Varun Chandrasekhar , SRP, Sealdah.

A young journalist posted on Facebook on Monday that while she was returning home on a Diamond Harbour-bound train from Sealdah, someone threw a plastic packet, apparently filled with urine and a stone, at her even as the train pulled out of Park Circus station. The woman, who was sitting by the window, said she got drenched and the stone barely missed her head. “Post evening, people target ladies compartments with stones and plastics carrying filth. What if someone throws acid someday? Who will take that responsibility?” she wrote in a social media post around 7.45pm on Monday. She also posted a photo of her drenched face.

Barely two weeks ago, a woman from Ranaghat claimed she was pushed off a moving train between Park Circus and Sealdah stations on the evening of Saraswati Puja, when she had protested against a man accosting her in the near-empty coach. Another woman complained an assailant had tried to snatch her daughter’s gold chain on the same route the same evening and when she protested, he had punched and slapped the daughter before snatching away the gold chain.

Cops said they have arrested three men in the snatching incident and recovered the gold chain but the assailant who had pushed the young woman off a moving train was yet to be identified.

On Tuesday, TOI took a walk along the tracks between Park Circus and Sealdah and then took a train ride from Sealdah to Ballygunge to find people drinking by the tracks and liquor dens being operated near Park Circus station. Woman daily commuters said on this stretch, they shut windows in fear of being attacked from outside and sat in groups so that they would be able to fight criminals, who often jumped into their compartment.

Although cops said they had intensified policing, passengers claimed otherwise. “Most days, there is no guard on trains,” said Sunita Halder, who commutes between Sealdah and Subhasgram.

353,['11/03/2020'],Bihar man killed in Kolkata on festival day for ‘protesting against drinking’,"The spot in Sovabazar where the assault took place

KOLKATA: An argument on the evening of Dol led to the death of a 35-year-old man who had come to Kolkata from Bihar searching for a better prospect. The incident took place on Monday night in Sovabazar following which cops from the Burtolla police station have arrested two persons on the charges of culpable homicide not amounting to murder and serious hurt.Police denied that the incident had any link with Dol, but locals said the victim, Pramod Shaw, had protested against some youths, allegedly involved in a parking syndicate, making obscene comments and drinking in the open during the celebrations.The Burtolla police station received an information around 8.30pm on Monday that one person was lying on the pavement in front of Aurobindo Sarani. “We reached the spot and took Shaw to RG Kar Hospital, where he was declared dead. An inquiry revealed an argument had broken out between Avishek Gupta (28) and Jibon Debnath alias Sanu (32), both residents of the area. As the altercation continued, Shaw tried to intervene. At some point, the argument snowballed into a fight and both Gupta as well as Debnath it Shaw, who fell on the edge of a raised structure on the pavement. Shaw sustained severe cuts and bleeding injuries on his throat that led to his death,” said joint CP (crime) Murlidhar Sharma. “The relevant pieces of evidence were collected, witnesses examined and accused—Gupta and Debnath—were arrested.”The residents of the area TOI spoke to, however, presented a different version. According to Ranjit Shaw, a local, Shaw had protested when he saw Debnath misbehaving with a woman passing by. Gupta joined Debnath and the two together assaulted him. They allegedly dragged Shaw into an adjoining room, where they assaulted him till he fell unconscious. There were several marks of the victim being hit with a sharp and penetrating object, claimed Ranjit.The family of the accused, however, denied all the claims. They said Shaw, too, was drunk and got involved in an argument with Gupta and Debnath. They claimed Shaw pushed Debnath away but he himself fell down and injured himself fatally.Shaw, who is engaged in producing stitched bags, had come from Begusarai in Bihar to Kolkata almost three decades ago but he would often visit his hometown. He had married about a decade ago and his wife and eight-year-old daughter live in Bihar. “The accused has a major stake in the local parking syndicate. The police know about several instances, when they had threatened people. The two also flaunt their political connections,” Ranjit claimed.The local councillor, Sunanda Sarkar, said even she was aware of the background of the two accused and how they made trouble in the area. The political connections they flaunted, claimed the councillor, were all fake and fabricated to suit their needs.",kolkata,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74568711,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-110931,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/man-killed-on-festival-day-for-protesting-against-drinking/articleshow/74567755.cms

MALAPPURAM: When Haroon Karim T K , a blind Class X student of GVHSS Mankada in the district wrote SSLC examination using a laptop on Tuesday, it created a history. It is for the first time that a student used a laptop for writing public examination in the state.

Haroon used laptop for writing Malayalam Paper 1 examination with a special permission from the general education department. A separate classroom was arranged for Haroon to write exam.

Haroon said it was comfortable for him to write examination using a laptop provided by school authorities. “The examination started at 9.45am. An invigilator, who is also an IT expert, supported me by reading out questions one after the other during 15-minute long cool off time and it helped me to be well-prepared to start typing answers, by 10am.

“I managed to finish the examination by 11.30am, without availing an additional time granted by the school authorities. The invigilator later took prints out my answer paper and attached them with the main sheet with register number and other details,” he said

Haroon used screen reader software to listen to the answers he wrote during the exam. He is planning to use infty editor software for typing signs and formulas for science and mathematics examinations.

355,['11/03/2020'],Death sentence: Calcutta HC cites ‘residual doubt’,"Representative image

KOLKATA: In a first, Calcutta High Court on Friday cited “residual doubt”, which sets a higher standard of proof than normally acceptable by courts, to commute the death sentence to life of a 31-year-old Kandi resident for burning his wife and three minor daughters to death in May 2015.

First cited in a 2014 Supreme Court judgment, “residual doubt” was again mentioned as a reason in two judgments by the apex court in October 2019 to commute death sentences to life. In the 2014 verdict, the SC had defined it as “lingering or residual doubts in its mind” in spite of being convinced of the guilt of the accused beyond reasonable doubt. It had reasoned that since death is irreversible, this is also a safeguard against routine capital punishments by trial courts.

In a 21-page judgment, a division bench of justices Joymalya Bagchi and Suvra Ghosh at one point said, “These circumstances leave a lingering doubt whether the guilt of the appellant has been established with absolute certainty although one may have no doubt that the evidence on record is sufficient to uphold the conviction.” The HC said the prosecution has failed to establish that the possibility of reformation and rehabilitation of the convict is wholly ruled out. “Under such circumstances and in the light of lingering residual doubt vis a vis guilt of the appellant, it may not be prudent to confirm the death sentence imposed upon him,” the HC reasoned. The HC then commuted the death sentence to a life behind bars and made it clear that the convict will get no remission for three decades.

Police said Utsab Ali had married Nafija Bibi in 1998. They were initially happy but when Nafija gave birth to three daughters — Amina, Marshida and Tuhina — their relation turned sour and Nafija was mentally and physically tortured. On May 31, 2015, the bodies of Nafija and the couple’s three daughters, were found charred to death. Utsab was arrested later. Utsab had claimed that he was with a cousin that night. He, however, could not prove this “alibi”. A Murshidabad trial court in March 2018 sentenced Utsab to death.

The HC, while agreeing with the conviction order, faulted the probe for not doing forensic tests of seized articles, not questioning neighbours and inability to trace the woman with whom Utsab had illicit affair.

356,['11/03/2020'],Nadine Dorries: UK’s health minister contracts coronavirus,"LONDON: A senior health minister who is a key figure in the response to the coronavirus crisis in Britain has tested positive for the disease.Conservative MP Nadine Dorries is self-isolating after becoming the first MP to test positive for the virus. The parliamentary under-secretary of state for health and social care fell ill last friday, when ironically, she was signing a statutory instrument in relation to coronavirus. She took the test on Monday and revealed the results on Tuesday saying: “I can confirm I have tested positive for coronavirus. As soon as I was informed I took all advised precautions and have been self-isolating at home. Public Health England (PHE) has started detailed contact tracing and the department and my parliamentary office are closely following their advice.""The health secretary Matt Hancock tweeted: “Really sorry to hear Nadine has tested positive for coronavirus. She has done the right thing by self isolating at home, and both NHS and PHE staff have been brilliant. We all wish her well as she recovers.”Dorries, a senior health minister who helped draw up the legislation to tackle the illness, has mixed with hundreds of MPs in Parliament and civil servants in the past week.Officials are now trying to identify all those with whom she has been in contact, meaning a whole host of people at the heart of the British government may have to self isolate.She also met 50 members of the public at a constituency surgery over the weekend and on Thursday night was at a reception in Downing Street for International Women’s Day with UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson.The 62-year-old tweeted late Tuesday: “Thanks for so many good wishes. It’s been pretty rubbish but I hope I’m over the worst of it now. More worried about my 84yo (sic) mum who is staying with me and began with the cough today. She is being tested tomorrow. Keep safe and keep washing those hands, everyone.”She is not the first health minister in the world to contract the virus. On 25 February, Iran's deputy health minister, Iraj Harirchi, said he had contracted coronavirus and placed himself in isolation, a day after appearing feverish at a press conference.By Tuesday evening the number of confirmed cases in Britain had risen to 382. The UK is expecting a sharp peak in cases in the coming weeks.Deputy chief medical officer for England Dr Jenny Harries said she expected significant increases in the number of cases in the UK beginning in about 10 to 14 days time at which time anyone with flu-like symptoms would be asked to self-isolate.The number of cases in Italy rocketed from hundreds to thousands in just a few weeks and Britain is expected to follow the same pattern. Hand sanitisers, liquid hand wash and toilet paper are virtually sold out across Britain with shelves lying empty as people panic buy and stockpile. Many general practitioners and hospitals are reporting these items are now being stolen from their premises. In one incident a hand sanitiser dispenser was ripped off the wall from a cancer ward at Northampton General Hospital and hospital staff are reporting they are also stolen from the end of patients’ beds.Some arcade owners in Britain have removed soft toys and are stocking grabber machines with toilet paper and sanitiser. Ho Barts Amusement Arcade in Devon has replaced Frozen and Peter Rabbit teddy bears with hand sanitiser and toilet rolls, whilst East Yorkshire arcade Bridlington's Chapmans Funland has filled its toy grabber machine with toilet rolls.",world,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74568399,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-72341,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/uk/uks-health-minister-contracts-coronavirus/articleshow/74568393.cms

""Instead we will be saying a quiet prayer,"" says the 23-year-old. ""It will feel strange, but this is for our own safety and therefore we must accept it.""On March7, a mail was circulated from the desk of the Archbishop of Madras and Mylapore to various diocese in Chennai with the subject: "" Coronavirus "", mentioning guidelines to be followed until the Easter service on April 12.""Our first faith response is to turn to God,"" said the letter addressed to parish priests . ""I am recommending the following steps for the control of the virus.""The letter instructs parish priests to encourage people not to shake hands at the sign of peace but to ""greet each other with folded hands (namaste)"". It also states that Holy Communion should be received in the hand and not the mouth as is the norm.“On Good Friday, at the Veneration of the Cross discourage people from kissing the Cross. The blessing with a raised Cross would be adequate. Those who desire, could come in a queue and make reverence with a bow,” says the letter. The priests have also been asked to “purify their hands in a bowl of water/sanitizer” before distribution of the Holy Communion. The Holy water stoups, which people dip their fingers in before entering church, will now be kept dry.The letter also mentions that if there is any indication that an individual in the community is infected, parish priests can temporarily suspend meetings.Priests are taking other precautions as well. At Luz Church, for instance, Father Peter Thumma is trying to cancel trips to the Holy Land, which are usually organized for the members of the parish in summer. Short trips during the Lenten period have also been called off. “This letter is issued in the interest of the parishioners,” says Father Thumma. “For a couple of weeks now in church we have been advising people on preventive measures. We’ve been telling them to eat a healthy diet, have some vitamin C, maintain hygiene, and wear masks if necessary. Better to be safe,” he says.

359,['11/03/2020'],Yes Bank News: Small lenders that cleared cheques via Yes Bank stuck,"MUMBAI: Yes Bank ’s disconnect from various payments and fund transfer networks is affecting over 50 small banks, including cooperative, foreign and regional rural banks.

With the moratorium shutting Yes Bank from the cheque clearing and real time gross settlement (RTGS) systems, several other banks that depend on the troubled private lender are also shut out.

Yes Bank provides submember bank services to cooperative, private and foreign banks whose operations are too small to invest in a direct membership. The services include facilities such as RBI clearing house, RTGS, national electronic funds transfer (NEFT), the national financial switch (for ATMs).

Among the foreign banks that the troubled Yes Bank was servicing is Doha Bank. Several district central cooperative banks are also customers of Yes Bank.

The affected banks include 13 cooperative banks and regional rural banks in the northeast where banking penetration is relatively lower. Cheques of these banks cannot be presented for clearing as lenders have issued instructions that those that are sub-members of the clearing system through Yes Bank’s membership will not be able to get their cheques to clear.

“Yes Bank is unlike the small cooperative banks that have been regulatory placed under moratorium by the RBI. Besides being a large bank, it is also a financial services infrastructure provider for other banks,” said a banker.

Earlier this week, the fintech world was thrown into a disarray as many startups were blocked form UPI payments as they were using application programming interfaces (APIs) provided by Yes Bank.

Also, Yes Bank has 92,065 point of sale (PoS) terminals (card swipe machines), which cannot be used due to the moratorium. Thus, merchants that have only Yes Bank PoS machines have not been able to accept card payments.

361,['11/03/2020'],Rajinikanth: Periyar comment row;Case against Rajinikanth dismissed,"Actor Rajinikanth

CHENNAI: Actor Rajinikanth scored his first major win in a court of law, when a magistrate court refused to categorise his statement on social reformer EVR Periyar as 'hate speech' and dismissed a petition seeking registration of a criminal case against him.

The petition to register a case against Rajinikanth was filed by Dravidar Viduthalai Kazhagam (DVK).

Dismissing the plea, Roslyn Durai, metropolitan magistrate-II at Egmore, observed that the alleged speech of the actor is at best defamatory which constitutes an offence under Sections 499 and 500 of IPC.

""Defamation is non-cognizable, and maintainable as private complaint. In this circumstance, this court finds that no grounds are made out for concluding offences Sections 153 A, 504 and 505 IPC are attracted, and the petitioner can file private complaint for defamation, damages, and compensation, if so advised.""

Recording the contentions of the petitioner, the magistrate said: ""On hearing the audio CD recording of the speech of Rajinikanth, made on January 14, it is seen that he has stated what he thought was a fact, about a rally held in Salem in 1971, by Thanthai Periyar, and which according to him was also published in a weekly magazine of that period.""

As for the Supreme Court order submitted by the complainant's side to prove that Rajinikanth's speech was indeed a hate speech, the magistrate said: ""There is no similarity between the type of speech dealt with in the decision of Supreme Court in Shamit Sanyal case and the speech of the actor. The speech in the cited decision encouraged the followers of the orator to breach law and commit offences. Whereas the speech of actor, is at best defamatory.""

364,['11/03/2020'],Leipzig cruise past Spurs into Champions League quarters,"(AFP photo)

LEIPZIG: Tottenham crashed out of the Champions League as RB Leipzig cruised to a 3-0 win on Tuesday to progress to the quarter-finals for the first time 4-0 on aggregate.

Leipzig captain Marcel Sabitzer struck twice in the first 21 minutes to put the tie to bed before substitute Emil Forsberg added the third late on with his first touch.

Unlike many fixtures across Europe this week, there were no restrictions on supporters attending due to the spread of coronavirus and the Leipzig fans were able to enjoy a nerve-free evening.

Spurs travelled to eastern Germany shorn of striking options without the injured Harry Kane, Son Heung-min and Steven Bergwijn.

However, it was at the other end that they buckled inside the opening quarter of the game as two errors from Hugo Lloris in goal turned a tough task into an impossible one.

Mourinho left club record signing Tanguy Ndombele on the bench after publicly criticising the French midfielder's desire in Saturday's 1-1 draw at Burnley, but the switch to a 3-4-3 formation did little to prevent Spurs' winless streak in all competitions stretching to six games.

Leipzig took just 10 minutes to open the scoring when Lloris did not get a strong enough right hand to stop Sabitzer's strike from outside the box finding the bottom corner.

Timo Werner then fired home from close range only to be denied by the offside flag as Leipzig opened up the Tottenham defence at will.

And the visitors did not learn their lesson as Serge Aurier was caught napping by a purposeful burst from Angelino.

The Manchester City loanee's cross was met by a powerful header by Sabitzer, but Lloris should still have done better to keep the ball out at his near post.

Lloris did make some measure of amends by saving from Werner and Patrik Schick to keep the score down before half-time, while at the other end Peter Gulasci was finally forced into action by Erik Lamela.

Spurs produced a remarkable fightback from 3-0 down on aggregate away at Ajax in last season's semi-finals to make the final for the first time in the club's history thanks to Lucas Moura's hat-trick.

But in keeping with their collapse since that night in Amsterdam last May, Mourinho's men lacked the quality and belief needed to reproduce that thrilling fightback.

Moura was again the one source of inspiration as he teed up Dele Alli for Spurs' best chance of the night, but the England midfielder's mishit effort was easily saved by Gulasci.

Forsberg was more clinical just 32 seconds after replacing Sabitzer to fire into the far corner three minutes from time.

Tottenham's season now hinges on refinding their form in the Premier League if they are not to miss out on the Champions League for the first time in five years.

Spurs are languishing in eighth in the Premier League, seven points adrift of the top four, and in desperate need for Mourinho to exact revenge on Manchester United for his sacking last season when the Red Devils visit north London on Sunday.

365,['11/03/2020'],Joe Biden: Former Vice President of United States Joe Biden grip on Democratic nomination tightens with big wins,"DETROIT: Joe Biden took a vice-like grip on the Democratic nomination race Tuesday with big primary wins in Michigan and other states confirming his growing advantage over leftist Bernie Sanders in the contest to take on President Donald Trump.First US networks projected a huge victory in Mississippi for Biden, reflecting his popularity among strategically vital African American voters. Then came Missouri and, biggest of all, Michigan -- one of the industrial Midwestern giants due to be a key battleground in the general election.""Thank you Michigan!"" tweeted Biden, still waiting for results from three more states holding primaries before the night was over.Barring major surprises, Biden now eyes a strong path to becoming the Democrats' candidate in the bruising and deeply divisive November polls.But if the veteran centrist and former vice president under Barack Obama might increasingly shift focus on trying to make Trump a one-term president, Sanders' next step remains a big question.Will he fight on to the bitter end, as he did four years ago against the eventual nominee Hillary Clinton? Or will he bow out early?Many Democrats blame the uncompromising, self-declared democratic socialist for subjecting Clinton to friendly fire just as she was struggling -- ultimately unsuccessfully -- against the Trump insurgency.Adding to nerves in a country on edge after three tumultuous years under Trump, fears of the coronavirus epidemic prompted both campaigns to cancel election-night rallies.Organizers of a live television debate scheduled Sunday, pitting the fiery Sanders and the moderate Biden, likewise said they would take the extraordinary step of not allowing the usual live audience.For Biden, Tuesday's six-state contest, coming a week after his surprise comeback in voting on Super Tuesday, demonstrated that his once shambolic campaign is in rude health and now ready to face Trump.Michigan in particular -- an industrial giant that Trump won in an upset in 2016 -- was targeted by Biden as a place to put down a marker ahead of the November election.Sanders accused Biden of selling out to corporate interests and ignoring a passionate leftist base.But the former vice president has insisted on steering a centrist line that he says can bring the divided country back together -- and it appears to have paid off.Banking on his credibility as Obama's vice president, he has managed to get out an enthusiastic black vote.But with stories of a hard-knock childhood in Pennsylvania and Delaware frequently featuring in his speeches, Biden also wants to recapture the blue collar white voters that Trump successfully poached from the Democrats in 2016.""Biden is putting together the traditional Democratic coalition, and that's still a very powerful one,"" said Julian Zelizer, a professor of political history at Princeton University and media pundit.Early Tuesday, Biden began his final push by meeting workers at an under-construction automobile plant in Detroit, where he received cheers but also was confronted by one worker.In a startling exchange, the worker, wearing a construction helmet and reflective vest, accused Biden of seeking to take away Americans' firearms.""You're full of shit,"" an angry Biden shot back, insisting that he supports the constitutional right to bear arms.""I'm not taking your gun away,"" he said in the encounter, which Trump supporters quickly pointed to as evidence of Biden's inability to stand pressure -- but supporters saw as a show of mettle.""Gimme a break, man,"" Biden added.Voters came out under the growing shadow of the global coronavirus epidemic, which has infected over 900 people across the United States and killed 28.Sanders and Biden called off customary election-night rallies -- both planned in Cleveland, part of another Rust Belt state, Ohio, which votes next week -- in line with public health warnings from state officials.Their precaution is at odds with Trump, who has vowed to keep holding his campaign's sometimes raucous rallies despite the concerns.Washington state, which has borne the brunt of the crisis and also was going to the polls Tuesday, votes entirely by mail -- an option some experts say should become more widespread as the epidemic grows.Idaho and North Dakota were also voting.Artist and designer Cecilia Covington, 61, was the first person to vote in Precinct 123 in downtown Detroit, braving the drizzle as she arrived at Chrysler Elementary School to vote for Biden.""When he wasn't doing well in the polls I was really concerned,"" she said, adding that his stunning comeback on Super Tuesday ""put my confidence back.""""We've got to get '45' out of office,"" she said, referring to the current president.On Super Tuesday, Biden won 10 out of 14 states that voted, giving him a healthy lead even before the latest round of primaries.",world,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74568659,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-117650,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/us-presidential-elections/joe-biden-grip-on-democratic-nomination-tightens-with-big-wins/articleshow/74568669.cms

KOLKATA: The new traffic flow from BT Road towards Shyambazar — hours before the first big test on Wednesday (schools and offices reopen after dol and holi breaks) — operated smoothly. With the new traffic flow, introduced with the opening of the rail level crossing at Chitpore, the Lockgate flyover is being used in the reverse direction — north to south.

The flyover was earlier being used for south-to-north traffic flow and locals had demanded a shift in traffic flow in the morning rush hours. Lalbazar indicated it would monitor the traffic flow for the next two weeks. The possibility of making the traffic tidal has not been ruled out yet. “We want to ensure that no student is inconvenienced during their board exams. With HS exams barely about a week away, we will not go for too many experiments,” explained an officer at Lalbazar.

“Now, for the northward journey, the smaller vehicles take Cossipore Road and buses Railway Service Road (Chitpore level crossing) for BT Road. For southward journey, buses and small vehicles take Lockgate flyover for C R Avenue or Shyambazar. In this way, we have reduced snarls on RG Kar Bridge,” said an officer.

The cops, though, are not yet diverting the buses or trucks to Brajadayal Shah Road and onwards to Strand Bank Road and Khagen Chatterjee Road. “Some expansion work is yet to be completed on Khagen Chatterjee Road that is expected to handle heavy traffic at night,” said police.

“Once it’s over, trucks can use Strand Bank Road and reach the commercial hubs of central Kolkata. The pressure on Cossipore Road will also ease. As of now, as a precautionary measure, we are not allowing vehicle movement on Lockgate flyover after 12 midnight till morning,” explained an officer from Shyambazar traffic guard.

Khagen Chatterjee Road – when fully operational — will connect Braja Dayal Shah Road located next to Cossipore Bridge with Sethpukur Road and Pranakrishna Mukherjee Road on Bagbazar side. “Trucks can use this to enter Chitpore terminal and then move towards Burrabazar and Posta using the Strand Bank Road that goes up to Armenian Ghat,” said an officer.

KOLKATA: The cops will train hundreds of bus drivers and conductors on gender sensitization. The police will include both government and private transport workers in this project. Auto, app-cab and taxi drivers, too, will be given the same training.

Money from Nirbhaya fund, which aims at making commuting in Kolkata safer for women, will be used for the purpose.

The decision has been taken in the wake of some recent incidents at Ruby crossing, Garden Reach and Jodhpur Park where women commuters were either physically assaulted or molested by their male co-passengers.

The training will also be a part of Kolkata Police ’s “Respect Women” movement that is likely to be officially launched on Wednesday, along with the closing ceremony of ‘Tejaswini’ workshop.

“We will be sensitising the transport workers on how to respect women and will cover all aspects of gender equality. A key concern area here will be how to make a woman comfortable while she is travelling,” said joint CP (crime) Murlidhar Sharma .

The training is likely to be organized over the weekend in batches and the best performers are likely to be rewarded. “Twenty-five traffic guards will be involved,” said an officer.

Kolkata’s transport workers, though, will not be the first ones to undergo this training. More than 10,000 bus drivers and conductors of Haryana Roadways are undergoing gender sensitization training by a private university under the “Safe Gaadi” initiative, an official said.

There has been six molestation attempts reported from inside public buses since 2019. Last month, the Lake police had nabbed a person for molesting a young woman hailing from Darjeeling while she was returning home from a south Kolkata mall.

The Watgunge police recently detained some people from inside a government bus at Kidderpore after an elderly woman complained of being harassed inside the vehicle. The Survey Park police had detained a 32-year-old man for allegedly passing lewd comments at a woman at an EM Bypass bus stop from inside the bus. The accused was nabbed after a homeguard of Purba Jadavpur traffic guard was alerted by the victim and the OC of the traffic guard himself reached the spot to nab the accused.

“We are always ready to react immediately to any such distress call,” said a Lalbazar officer. But he added: “But the men in uniform on the spot should take charge. This means reaching out to the woman, registering a police complaint and even driving down to the nearest police station,” said the officer.

There have been multiple arrests following calls to Dial 100 ever since model Ushoshi Sengupta was chased by bikers and the police brass introduced a new SOP that stressed on coordination between Lalbazar and police stations.

Andrew Cuomo said authorities would set up a one-mile radius ""containment zone"" around the epicenter of an outbreak in New Rochelle in suburban Westchester County.Cuomo explained that all facilities in the zone that hold large gatherings, such as schools and temples, would be closed for two weeks beginning Thursday.""We're also going to use the National Guard in the containment area to deliver food to homes, to help with the cleaning of public spaces,"" Cuomo said.There have been 173 confirmed cases of Covid-19 in New York state, including 108 in Westchester County, home to New Rochelle where the majority of infections have been detected.Cuomo told reporters that businesses in the containment zone will remain open and that people will be free to come and go as they wish, insisting there is no quarantine.""You're not containing people, it's facilities,"" he said.""It is a dramatic action, but it is the largest cluster in the country.

369,['11/03/2020'],Four-goal Josip Ilicic guides Atalanta into Champions League quarters,"(AP photo)

VALENCIA: Atalanta 's fairytale Champions League run continued inside an empty stadium on Tuesday as Josip Ilicic scored four times in a 4-3 win over Valencia that sent his team into the quarter-finals 8-4 on aggregate.

A frantic contest inside an echoing Mestalla stadium was the first of several in the competition to be played behind closed doors due to the coronavirus, with 55,000 vacant seats creating a surreal atmosphere that was never likely to deliver a momentous Valencia comeback.

They had been tasked with overturning a 4-1 defeat from the opening game in Italy and any hopes were all-but dashed inside 90 seconds when Mouctar Diakhaby conceded the first of two penalties, each converted by Ilicic.

In between, Kevin Gameiro had levelled for Valencia and then scored again shortly after half-time before Ferran Torres lobbed in to leave the hosts needing three in just over 20 minutes.

Yet any chance of a revival was quickly snuffed out as Ilicic completed his hat-trick and added a fourth to ensure Atalanta ended a strange evening with their names in the draw on March 20.

The Slovenia international also became the first player to score four times away from home in a Champions League knockout match.

Atalanta's progress remains the greatest surprise of this year's tournament, in which they lost all three of their opening group games and are featuring for the first time in the club's 113-year history.

""After a difficult start to this competition, we got the hang of it,"" said coach Gian Piero Gasperini afterwards.

All the more the shame then that their advance on the back of two brilliant victories over Valencia was overshadowed by the sight of a Champions League knock-out tie being played with only a handful of stadium staff in the stands.

The shouts of the players were audible throughout while in the first half Valencia seemingly projected crowd noise through a sound system, although it was later turned off when hopes of a comeback had disappeared.

Valencia's supporters had gathered outside the stadium before kick-off to welcome the team bus but none were allowed inside. Atalanta are based in Bergamo in northern Italy, one of the worst-hit regions in a country that has had 631 people killed by the virus so far.

After the final whistle, the players held up a shirt to a television camera that had the message, ""Bergamo, this is for you!"" written across the front.

""We are very happy with how we have represented a region that suffers so much,"" said Gasperini.

Spain announced on Monday that all schools in the Madrid area will close on Wednesday while La Liga had confirmed earlier on Tuesday that all matches in the top two divisions will be played behind closed doors for two weeks at least.

The sense of deflation at not having any fans on hand was impossible to ignore because before even two minutes were up, Valencia were behind.

Diakhaby slid in to block Ilicic's dummy-shot and scythed down the striker as he turned back. Ilicic drove the penalty down the middle for his 18th goal of the season.

Valencia equalised after Atalanta conceded possession cheaply in midfield and Rodrigo slid in Gameiro to finish, but Ilicic converted a second penalty before half-time, after Diakhaby feathered the ball with his hand.

Gameiro made it 2-2 by heading in Torres' cross and then Torres found the net himself, lifting the ball over Marco Sportiello to give Valencia some hope with 23 minutes left.

But four minutes later, Ilicic completed his treble with a driven shot into the corner and with progress secured, he grabbed the win too when the ball spilled out to him at the back post and he guided it into the top corner.

Offering prayers to keep rain away

DHARAMSALA: It was Holi on Tuesday and yet you had to really look out for the usual bustling, in-your-face celebrations here. But as you walked the streets towards the HPCA stadium, you could barely miss the two hot topics in the hill station at the moment- the ODI between India and South Africa on Thursday and awareness about coronavirus . The reason behind the low-key Holi celebrations here is prevention against contracting coronavirus.The Indian cricket board ( BCCI ) is already facing the heat from many quarters for going ahead with the IPL as the virus claims more victims around the world by the day. As the locals rushed to throng the practice area to watch the Indian team train on Tuesday afternoon, the virus and possibility of rain on match day dominated the murmurs.The South African camp has decided to strictly stick to its itinerary - which includes curbs on the number practice sessions, media interactions and negligible public interactions. The visitors didn't come out for a hit in the nets on Tuesday. The Indian team, however, looks more relaxed and at ease with the situation. There was the usual camaraderie amongst the boys and hardly any hesitance in shaking hands with people - something that the medical experts have advised to refrain from.""The Indian team was given a briefing about the coronavirus when they were in New Zealand a couple of weeks ago. They are aware of the dos and don'ts,"" a senior BCCI official told TOI.However, the government agencies here have directed the Himachal Pradesh Cricket Association (HPCA) to take all necessary steps to ensure there is no outbreak in the hill station. The tourism industry, the lifeline of the economy here, has already taken a hit with stringent restrictions put in place. The hotels have been sent advisories from HPCA and government about the need to check the background and travel history of their guests coming in for the match. ""There has been no case of coronavirus in Dharamsala . It's up to us that it remains that way. The medical facilities are not strong enough here to deal with an outbreak,"" an HPCA source told TOI.The HPCA, on its part, has put up huge innovative billboards around the area that suggest the precautions that need to be taken. The boards also talk about the dos and don'ts while requesting the public to not panic. ""The chief medical officer is personally screening people coming in through the airport,"" informed an HPCA official. ""At the stadium, we have got 10 doctors manning the entry points. There are laser thermometers to screen all the spectators. There will be masks all amenities required for precaution will be available besides the usual medical facilities like ambulance,"" the source added.Weather has not been kind to the HPCA stadium whenever there has been an international fixture here. The last one here-a T20I between India and South Africa last September-was washed out without a ball being bowled. The forecast isn't encouraging this time too with rain expected on Wednesday and Thursday. The HPCA officials organized a puja at a local temple to keep rain away. ""It has always been a ritual here and people here believe that the previous international matches happened because of it despite poor weather. Last time the puja was not done properly that's why it is believed that the match was washed out,"" an HPCA source said.Besides the superstition, the HPCA has ensured that it has brought in big covers to cover the entire ground unlike the last instance.",sports,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74568735,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-206847,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//sports/cricket/south-africa-in-india/india-vs-south-africa-dharamsala-ready-for-cricket-in-the-time-of-coronavirus/articleshow/74568740.cms

372,['11/03/2020'],Three BEST bus stops are Marine Drive's worst nightmare,"The stops on Marine Drive haven’t been repaired since monsoon

MUMBAI: Three BEST bus stops on Marine Drive have been in a shambles since the monsoon. Locals say repeated complaints have proved ineffective. They say waiting at the stops is risky because the rusted structures could collapse or at least parts could come off. The three stops are opposite the police gymkhana, InterContinental Hotel and near the Marine Lines flyover.

Malabar Hill resident Clyde Crasto, who is also an NCP spokesperson, said he noticed the condition of the stops in September. ""I tweeted about it, tagging BMC and BEST. Nothing was done.""

On February 28, Crasto tweeted again. He got a reply from BEST only on Monday, on Twitter. ""They said 'Bus Queue Shelter' is not constructed by BEST and the issue has been taken up with the ward office,"" Crasto said.

A BEST official told TOI bus stops on the Marine Drive promenade weren't constructed or maintained by BEST. ""We will follow up with the officials concerned,"" he said. A BEST spokesperson said, ""The bus queue shelters belong to MMRDA.""

BMC's ward-level officials said civic authorities removed ""some loose members"" from the bus stops and have contacted MMRDA. ""Also, for any changes to be made on the bus stops, we would need the heritage body's permission, considering that Marine Drive is a heritage precinct,"" said assistant municipal commissioner C Alle, C-Ward, which contains Marine Drive.

373,['11/03/2020'],College campuses empty as virus scare pushes learning online,"CAMBRIDGE: College seniors began making tearful goodbyes, not knowing if they'd return to see friends on campus. Some were heading to homes without internet, leaving them to wonder if they could keep up with online classes. And some worried about finding a way to afford a flight on only a few days' notice.As dozens of universities cancel in-person classes and move instruction online amid fears over the new coronavirus, thousands of students are left scrambling to find their way home while their professors puzzle over how to move weeks of courses to the internet.Schools nationwide announced plans to cancel in-person classes through spring break or beyond amid fears about the virus' spread. Some are pausing campus classes for a few days or weeks, including Columbia, Princeton and Indiana University, while others are canceling classes through the end of the term, including Stanford and Harvard.On Tuesday, Harvard undergraduates were told to leave campus by Sunday and stay home until the end of the semester. The abrupt order drew outrage from students who are also juggling midterm exams, senior projects and daily classes.Harvard student Silvana Gomez didn't know how she would afford to return on such short notice to her family's home in West New York, New Jersey. Gomez, a junior studying psychology, also worries about the risk she could pose to her father, who is 66 and has a health condition that could make him more vulnerable to the virus.""It's terrifying. I'm definitely very scared right now about what the next couple days, the next couple weeks look like,'' she said. ""I have to stay on campus and if Harvard doesn't allow me to stay on campus, then I really don't know what's going to happen.""Harvard senior Nick Wyville doesn't know how he'll take online courses at his family's home near Anniston, Alabama. It's a rural area, he said, and the closest internet access is at the county's only Starbucks, miles from his home.""We are really panicking right now, and a lot of students have anxiety,"" he said. ""A lot of us woke up this morning to a very ominous email that's essentially evicting us from campus.""Stores were selling out of boxes near Harvard, one of several schools including Amherst College and St. John's University that asked students to move out of student housing and finish their courses for the year from home. Others, like Princeton University, are temporarily moving to online learning, even for students who remain on campus, and telling them to prepare for tight restrictions on social activities.Yale University also told students that classes will be moved online following the end of spring break. Students were also encouraged to move back home as soon as Sunday and not to travel abroad in an effort to stop the spread of the virus.With more campuses canceling classes by the day, the potential impact looms large into the spring for final exams, new student tours and graduation ceremonies.For most people, the coronavirus causes only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia. The vast majority of people recover from the new virus.Dan King, president of the American Association of University Administrators, predicted ""many, many more"" colleges will move learning online as campuses work to contain the virus and the anxiety around it.At Amherst College, senior Tommy Mobley said news that classes were moving online for the rest of the semester was met with disappointment and panic as students scrambled to move off campus while wondering whether they would ever return.""There were just hundreds of students on their phones, there were students crying. You know, a lot of students seemed panicked and a lot of students seemed devastated by the news because, frankly, it's very shocking. And it's a major change,"" said Mobley, 23, from Newton, Massachusetts.As professors scramble to prepare online lessons, they have a long list of concerns. Without personal contact, some wonder how they'll know if students are falling behind. Some worry students won't participate in online discussions. And there are concerns about how to offer fair exams in an online setting.At Columbia University, Vincent Racaniello plans to teach his virology class through live video lectures that students can also watch later on YouTube. But he'll miss being able to walk around the lecture hall and look students in the eye to gauge if they're following along.""The best part of lecturing is the contact,"" said Racaniello, a professor of microbiology and immunology. ""I really do enjoy going and talking to the students. Afterward, they come down to ask questions. We walk to the subway together. It's all part of the educational experience, and that is hard to lose.""He expects the virus to continue spreading among students anyway.""Students are still going to be moving around the world, they're going to be moving around New York City, they're going to get infected,"" he said. ""I think it has minimal benefit in the long run and is more disruptive than it's worth.""At Fordham University, Rory Varrato said his philosophy classes, which rely heavily on classroom discussion, will likely become more like lectures as he moves to a video conference. He said he expects he'll take it easier on students when it comes to grading this term, given the unusual circumstances caused by the virus.""My hunch is that I will be more flexible, just recognizing it's likely that some students will become ill or have an increased stress level in general,"" he said. ""I'll definitely take all of that into consideration.""At New York University, which is moving to online classes starting on Wednesday, sophomore Mareda Michael, 19, wondered whether she would get her tuition's worth.""We're paying so much to go to this school, to not have the school experience is a waste of money,"" said Michael, who was weighing whether to go home to Los Angeles, California.At Harvard, students were told only a number of exceptions would be made for the orders to leave campus, primarily for international students who come from countries that have been hit hardest by the virus. Students were encouraged to raise any issues with housing officials or their faculty deans, said Harvard spokeswoman Rachael Dane.""We are working individually with them to meet their needs and ensure they are supported in this transition,"" Dane said in a statement.Sophomore Lucy Wickings is requesting to stay on campus during the closure but doesn't know if she will qualify. Wickings, 19, is homeless and has been saving income from three campus jobs to stay afloat over the summer. Now she fears she'll have to use her savings during the closure to cover meals and for travel to stay with a classmate's family.""College for me is the place where I'm supposed to be getting stable housing and food,"" said Wickings, who is originally from Port Huron, Michigan. ""I'm not really sure what to do.

Real Sociedad climbed to fourth in La Liga with a 2-1 win at Eibar on Tuesday, in the first Spanish match played without fans as part of measures to combat the spread of coronavirus.

Following a decision by the Spanish sports council earlier in the day, La Liga said the next two rounds of fixtures would be played in empty stadiums, starting with Tuesday's Basque derby.

The match had originally been scheduled to take place in February but was postponed because of poor air quality in the region following fires at a landfill site.

Played in near silence apart from the sounds of the players and staff shouting, Mikel Oyarzabal fired home his eighth goal of the campaign from the penalty spot after 16 minutes to put Real Sociedad ahead.

Fabian Orellana had a chance to level with a penalty at the other end after Igor Zubeldia handled in his own area but Alex Remiro kept out his effort.

Willian Jose added the second after 75 minutes following good work by winger Portu to seal the visitors' victory and take Real Sociedad above Getafe and Atletico Madrid, with 46 points from 27 games.

Eibar, 16th and two points clear of the relegation zone, were hampered by their lack of fans and only managed a late consolation when Joseba Zaldua handled in the area and Charles slammed in the game's third penalty.

DHARAMSALA: Browse through Hardik Pandya 's social media timeline and one would struggle to spot a trace of agony despite injury keeping him nearly seven months away from the game. He is all about unabashed swag which sometimes borders on brashness for many.Eight months after his last ODI, Team India's 'joker' card in white-ball card is back to take on South Africa in the first of the three ODIs here on Thursday. On Tuesday, the star all-rounder was in his elements in his first full nets session with the Indian team since he succumbed to a dodgy back during the T20I series against the same opponents at the top of the home season last September.The jokes flowed during warm-ups as his teammates rolled on the floor in the practice area. The 'come on, lads', 'well bowled, Boom (Bumrah)' and 'great going, guys' followed as the optional nets session got underway. He bowled with the new ball for a good 40 minutes interspersed with animated conversations with Jasprit Bumrah as bowling coach Bharat Arun watched closely. Hardik is visibly stronger, muscular having shed his frail outlook. He even posted a photo on Instagram last week, saying he has put on a good seven kilograms.But soon, his agony burst through when he went in to bat. He was mostly hanging back on his backfoot and polishing his power-hitting skills. As he half-batted a net bowler, he nearly smacked his stumps in disgust. A couple of balls later, his bat turned in his hands as Navdeep Saini 's searing full delivery nearly found his pads. Hardik lost his composure and hit the net hard, yelling at himself 'come on.'Head coach Ravi Shastri hopped on to his net and Hardik put his head down and labored through the nets. For a while now, he has been referred to as if he is India's magic trick to success in white-ball cricket albeit his more memorable performances have come in Test cricket. His emergence has been such that Indian cricket has almost been obsessed by the need to have a fast-bowling all-rounder. The team management even went ahead with like-for-like replacements in Vijay Shankar and Shivam Dube even as neither matched the Hardik's pedigree, especially when it came to seam bowling.Hardik is the key that performs the smooth transition in a batting innings. But it's his sharp seam bowling that adds the edge to this lineup. This is why his comeback was delayed by a couple of months since it was felt he was struggling to bowl at his peak for a considerable period of time in January.Sources told TOI that the selectors were at the recent DY Patil corporate tournament in Mumbai to watch how he bowls. ""He was sharp and looked really strong. It was always believed that his physique, his athleticism notwithstanding, was too frail to bear the kind of load that the team management expected him to,"" the source said.""Hardik has undergone rigorous training after he could not travel to New Zealand. He was flown to London to consult his doctor and get a better idea about where he stands with his fitness. After that the NCA trainers swung into action and he gained weight and strength in virtually no time,"" added the source.Hardik looks ready. As physio Nitin Patel lurks around him and attends to him during every break during practice, you realize how the team management looks after him. He has cleared all the mandatory medical and clinical tests organized by BCCI on Sunday. And now with the T20 World Cup in October, the team management would just hope the support system can get him going longer in this run.",sports,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74568873,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-213168,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//sports/cricket/south-africa-in-india/stronger-muscular-hardik-pandya-ready-for-his-second-coming/articleshow/74568886.cms

In case a passenger is being detected with fever during thermal scans at airports, immediate steps can be taken even before they leave the airport premises. “What we are afraid of is Covid-19 cases popping out from ordinary citizens of Mumbai. The fear is that in such a case we may not be able to exactly ascertain how many persons the affected patient came in touch with to take the right steps therein,” the civic chief said.The silver lining is the hope that the anti-Covid-19 drive will bring about behavioral changes among Mumbaikars. These include how one should always sneeze into a handkerchief or tissue and wash hands regularly.Elaborating on the points, Pardeshi said, “We have already started creating awareness on various fronts about Covid-19, starting with the BMC’s website — portal.mcgm.gov.in — where misconceptions are cleared and citizens informed about where they can get help.“However, our larger aim is to create a behavioral change among Mumbaikars wherein they forever continue to wash their hands frequently with soap and water even if they are not visibly dirty, cover their mouth with a tissue when they sneeze and contact the doctor in case they have cough, fever or difficulty in breathing.”He said citizens need to be aware that the virus does not spread via ‘bare air’, but “only when an affected person’s bodily fluid gets into another”. Apart from its civic hospitals, the BMC has also roped in real estate body CREDAI-MCHI to identify and designate four to five buildings as quarantine facilities. “We had conveyed the same to the association in a meeting we had with them last week and they have responded positively,” said Pardeshi.Kasturba Hospital near Saatrasta is the main facility currently to test patients while hospitals like Seven Hills in Marol, Rajawadi in Ghatkopar, the Bhabha Hospitals in Bandra and Kurla, and the Jogeshwari trauma care facility are also being considered for isolation facilities if required. So far, Pardeshi confirmed, 139 persons have been admitted, of whom reports on 133 turned out to be negative, while the reports on six are awaited.",mumbai,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74568903,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-158834,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/we-hope-anti-covid-19-drive-induces-behavioural-change-says-bmc-chief/articleshow/74568901.cms

A sure indicator of low demand for air travel was low airfares, especially last-minute airfares or those on flights scheduled to depart in 24 hours. On Tuesday, the cheapest Mumbai-Delhi return ticket for travel on Wednesday and return later in the week, started at Rs 5,000, that is, an average of Rs 2,500 one-way. “Mumbai-Delhi flights are always in high demand and even off-season, last-minute fares don’t drop so low,’’ said a travel agent, adding that he has only been handling cancellations since two weeks. Last weekend, the cheapest, 24-hour advance purchase Mumbai-Delhi return tickets began at Rs 8,000. “Over the weekend, as cases of coronavirus went up in the country, demand seems to have plummeted,’’ said the agent.Another route that witnesses high demand throughout the year is Mumbai-Kochi. But this week, you could fly to Kochi and back for only Rs 5,000. “A last-minute flight to Kochi generally costs Rs 6,000-7,000 one-way,’’ said the agent. Return airfares on Delhi-Kochi route began at Rs 7,200. Flights to Trivandrum were comparatively higher in demand with return airfares from Mumbai beginning at Rs 9,000. But other destinations like Bengaluru and Hyderabad were cheaper, with Rs 3,800 return airfares for travel from Mumbai. From Delhi, cheapest airfares began at Rs 5,800 for Hyderabad and Rs 6,700 for Bengaluru return.Coronavirus-linked travel plan cancellations have gone beyond airlines to include trains. Dinesh Kotha, co-founder, Confirmtkt, an online train ticket booking engine, said, “Since the past week we have seen a rise in train ticket cancellations due to coronavirus. Trains going towards Delhi have been impacted the most, with 25% higher cancellations, compared to last month.’’ He added that main routes affected were from Delhi, Kolkata, Bangalore, Hyderabad, Chennai. “Routes with more impact are Patna-New Delhi, Mumbai-Nagpur, Mumbai-Pune, Tirupati-Secunderabad, Ahmedabad-Mumbai, Bangalore-Chennai, Chandigarh-New Delhi and New Delhi-Varanasi. Due to the outbreak, new bookings have gone down by more than 20%.

380,['11/03/2020'],South Korea’s open virus alerts spark affair gossip,"SEOUL: Allegations of affairs, revelations of membership of religious sects: South Korea ’s openness about infected patients has been key in its fight against the coronavirus but raised uncomfortable questions over privacy and stigmatisation.South Korea has confirmed over 7,500 infections, one of the largest outside China, where the virus first emerged, although new case numbers have been declining. Officials say that has been made possible by widespread testing of potential contacts — the South has tested over 2,10,000.Across the country, local authorities have been issuing emergency alerts on cellphones to those living or working in districts where new cases have been confirmed. The text message arrives with a shrieking warning, announcing nearby locations visited by patients before they were diagnosed with the virus and their links to other cases.More information is available on municipal websites, sometimes with breakdowns of individuals ’ daily schedules, even down to the minute, and details of their residence and employer — often making them identifiable individually.In a country where virtually everyone owns a smartphone, doxxing — maliciously spreading private information about individuals and businesses online — has long been a problem. And the consequences have been sometimes embarrassing, even brutal, with the National Human Rights Commission describing them as “human rights violations”. “We can’t help but worry about the situation where the confirmed patients become subject to secondary damages, such as being criticised, ridiculed and abhorred online,” it said.Two confirmed patients have been accused of having an extra-marital affair, after their travel logs showed similarities. A woman who tested positive said she received hateful comments online after a city mayor revealed her boyfriend is a member of Shincheonji, the controversial religious sect linked to more than half the South’s cases.“I am having a hard time mentally, more so than (physical) pain,” she wrote on her Facebook account, which she has since turned private, asking other users not to share her personal information.Michael Hurt, a sociologist at Korea National University of Arts, said that while the alerts reassure the public that authorities are dealing with the epidemic, they can unintentionally lead to “stigmatisation of areas as infected or ‘dangerous’.” Companies identified as visited by infected people have also been hit.South Korea has an advanced medical system, a free press and a strong culture of public accountability, and Seoul’s foreign minister says the government has stressed transparency when tackling the public health crisis.But even a health ministry civil servant could not avoid online bullying after contracting the virus.The municipal government of Sejong — where the ministry is based — revealed that she took gym classes taught by an infected instructor, as well as a detailed breakdown of her daily schedule.Most online comments slammed her as “irresponsible” for going to a gym during the outbreak, but others picked on items such as her lunch hours, saying they were too long for a civil servant and accused her of “slacking off ”.The Central Disaster and Safety Countermeasure Headquarters was forced to step in to defend her, saying her gym visits took place before authorities advised people to avoid public gatherings and adopt social distancing.",world,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74569009,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-164350,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/rest-of-world/south-koreas-open-virus-alerts-spark-affair-gossip/articleshow/74568959.cms

Tuesday was Dhuleti, when the play of colour and water unfolded.This year, the coronavirus scare prompted a great degree of caution towards large festive gatherings. A housing society in Chembur requisitioned masks and hand sanitisers for its members. Dosti Flamingos in Sewri, which had initially called off celebrations, later gave in to insistent children who were keen to enjoy their annual roll in the mud. The society management organised a ""subdued"" Holi, urging residents to avoid playing with water and use as little dry gulal as possible.Even in this, revellers killed two birds with one stone, by showing off creativity and generating awareness. In Worli and Thane, people lit the bonfire of the corona asur (corona demon). They burnt with it ""social evils like lack of civic hygiene and littering"".Meanwhile, a 32-year-old construction worker from Kalyan drowned in a creek while celebrating Holi, Kalyan police said. Surinder Vikramsingh, who works at a construction site in Maharal village, was part of a group of five who ventured out for a swim, Kalyan taluka sub-inspector Bajrang Rajput said.In Vasai, an 18-year-old girl riding pillion was killed, while her 24-year-old friend sustained serious injuries when their two-wheeler skid on a sharp turn at Ambadi bridge in Vasai on Tuesday at 3pm. They were returning home after playing Holi at Manickpur Ground. Their families took autos, but Akshay Pawar rode with Kajal Kale. Akshay is being treated for serious head injuries. Sagar Shah, returning home after Holi, lost control of his car and it hit a tree at Vasant Nagari. He was arrested.Fifty persons were treated for Holi-related injuries on Tuesday, doctors at Mumbai's public hospitals said.Two with head injuries were admitted to state-run JJ Hospital (Byculla), while a person who accidentally ingested colours was admitted to BMC-run KEM Hospital (Parel).

RAJKOT: Dilip Doshi , one of the last in the assembly line of great Indian spinners, is a bit worried that the art is on the wane.

""I would hate to say the art is dying, but it definitely is in a problematic phase,"" the former left-arm spinner said on the sidelines of the Bengal versus Saurashtra Ranji Trophy final at the SCA Stadium here on Tuesday.

""Spin bowling all over the world is very ordinary now,"" he put it bluntly. ""But if you ask me, I like Nathan Lyon among modern-day spinners. He has a classical action and good attitude too. Otherwise, I don't see any hope,"" he lamented.

The former Bengal and Saurashtra cricketer rated Ravindra Jadeja as a better spinning option than Ravichandran Ashwin in the current Indian scenario. ""I still think Jadeja is the best spinner in this side,"" he said.

As for Ashwin, Doshi is not satisfied with his progression. ""Ashwin has not improved over the years. I agree he is steady, but I feel he has not improved to a level where he should have been for whatever reason it may be,"" he observed.

The doosra or teesra that modern bowlers employ cuts no ice with Doshi, who hails from the tradition that legends like Bishan Singh Bedi , Erapalli Prasanna , BS Chandrashekar represented.

""First get your pehela right,"" Doshi quipped. ""I will say 98% of spin bowling is your stock ball. So you have to master your stock ball first,"" he said.

The 72-year-old feels there's actually no need for experimentation. ""Controlling your stock ball is important and in doing so, you have to vary it according to situations and the batsmen. But that variation comes within your stock ball,"" he stated.

Doshi discouraged use of doosra as he felt it affects the stock ball. ""Spin bowling has a lot of muscle memory. If you keep changing your action, it affects your main delivery. It's like writing. You don't change your grip for that,"" he elaborated.

BENGALURU: A lifeline for residents of a pocket in Vaddarapalya , Horamavu , the main road has turned into a dirt track. However, the BBMP official concerned has remained unresponsive. At their wits' end, residents have announced a bounty of Rs 50,000 for anyone who gets in touch with the jurisdictional assistant executive engineer to get their grievance redressed.

Residents of Petra Layout , which is dotted by over 50 residential buildings, say for one year they have been negotiating the road which turns into a Kambala field at the slightest hint of rain. ""Every day, one or the other civic agency digs it up to lay a new pipeline. Once the dug-up road is filled, another agency takes up another round of work,"" said Rocky Mathew , a resident of Petra Layout.

""The road was recently dug up by BWSSB for laying a Cauvery pipeline, which worsened our problem,"" he said, adding that only last month, it was dug up to lay PNG lines.

""Officials do not discuss these projects with us. They just arrive out of nowhere and dig up the road, leaving us to put up with the inconvenience,"" said Manoj J, another resident.

""We repeatedly try to reach out to them, but they don't attend our calls,"" he added.

The exasperated residents held a meeting recently and announced they would hand over Rs 50,000 to whoever gets jurisdictional assistant executive engineer Ramesh to respond to their call and resolve the problem. ""We are tired of trying to contact the official. Anyone who is able to talk to Ramesh will be given Rs 50,000. We want our road back, no matter what it takes,"" said Mathew.

When contacted, Horamavu councillor Radhamma Venkatesh said: ""Our ward is spread over 17 sqkm and we are executing underground drainage work for the past six months at a cost of Rs 400 crore. Now we have begun laying Cauvery pipeline at a cost of Rs 178 crore. The work will take time."" People need to cooperate with the authorities as the work will only help them, she added.

Ramesh told TOI he was too busy to attend to residents' calls. ""There is so much work that I don't have the time to respond to my family's calls. How can anyone expect me to attend their calls?"" he said.

MUMBAI: The Western Railway (WR) has received the sanction from the commissioner of railway safety (CRS) to run trains at 130 kmph on the 694 km stretch between Virar and Nagda instead of restricting these to the 110 kmph allowed so far. With the nod, trains on the Mumbai-Gujarat-Delhi route shall gain speed, cutting down travel time by 30 minutes to 60 minutes.

On the WR, the Rajdhani Express and the Shatabdi Express already run at 130 kmph under special sanction. Now the blanket approval means more trains with LHB coaches will get upgraded to the 130 kmph level.

""The process of revising the timetable is underway at all zonal railways in which this stretch falls,"" an fficial said. ""The new timetable, which will come into effect from August 1, will reflect the running status of 130 kmph.""

Trains like the Paschim Express, the Gujarat Mail and the ones going to Rajasthan and Delhi with LHB coaches will be able to save time.

""The increase in speed of trains is now possible because of concrete sleepers laid with long rails and maintained by high-end technology machines which are procured from Austria,"" WR chief public relations officer Ravinder Bhakar said.

392,['11/03/2020'],Delay by a 10-year-old rape survivor to report abuse not unnatural: Calcutta HC,"Representative image

KOLKATA: The Calcutta High Court on Friday ruled that a delay by a 10-year-old rape survivor in south Kolkata to narrate her ordeal to her mother is not unnatural. The court also held that there was no reason to doubt the reason provided by the child — that she felt “shy and threatened”. She said this while testifying in court. “The belated reporting of incident by victim to her mother in such circumstances cannot be considered to be not probable, and unnatural,” the court observed.

The incident related to a case where a child was sexually abused in south Kolkata in January 2013. The rapist — a 50-year-old man — was the girl’s neighbour and lived on the floor below her home. The victim is a school-goer and stayed home for most part of the day, looking after her 14-month-old brother, since both of her parents worked for a living. The family was very poor. The accused used to call the child to his home in her parents’ absence and abused her several times before. That day in January 2013, he called her home abused her and even did unnatural sex, hurting her severely. The child did not tell this to her parents immediately. She narrated her trauma to her friend and the friend’s mother. The latter told the survivor’s mother about the incident. When her mother asked her, the child finally told her, prompting her to lodge an FIR a week after the incident — on January 7, 2013. The child then narrated her ordeal to a judicial magistrate, underwent medical examination and ossification test (to determine her age). An Alipore trial court in September 2014 convicted the accused to a life behind bars. The verdict was later challenged in the high court.

An HC division bench of Justice Sahidullah Munshi and Justice Subhasis Dasgupta wrote in its 20-page order: “The ordinary relationship, bonding, cohesion between a child and her parents differs from circumstance to circumstance. The girl who may not be comfortable to her parents in disclosing something, may be easy and comfortable with her friend, and her parents, for reciprocal understanding between the two.”

The HC said the clarity with which the girl narrated her ordeal to her mother and later to a judicial magistrate showed how the accused “not only had stolen the innocence of victim girl, but also had put her to face extreme sexual exploitation getting her alone in the opportune moment of her house.”

The HC said, “How a victim of rape will behave, and that too of a tender aged ten (10) year old girl, would depend upon the circumstances the victim was provided with, when she was sexually violated. A sense of fear, shyness, shame, adverse consequences to follow in the event of incident being disclosed to parents for the uncertainties of the behavioural pattern and the mindset of parents etc. would be matter of consideration, but the same, however, cannot be straight jacketed.”

Dismissing that accused’s argument of false testimonies and an attempt to blackmail him, the HC upheld the life sentence awarded to the accused by the trial court.

NEW DELHI: In a major relief for Delhiites, oil companies announced a cut of Rs 2.69 and Rs 2.33 in petrol and diesel prices respectively.

Following the announcement, the petrol price has been revised to Rs 70.29 and diesel to Rs 63.01 per litre in Delhi.

The move is believed to be a result of massive dip in crude oil prices in international markets recently.

On Monday, crude oil prices tanked over 30 per cent following Saudi Arabia 's decision to cut prices and raise production after the talks with OPEC+ countries fell out, marking the biggest price crash since the Gulf War.

397,['11/03/2020'],Biden says fighting for US 'soul' after big primary wins,"PHILADELPHIA: Joe Biden seized control of the Democratic nomination race Tuesday with big primary wins in Michigan and other states pointing to a crushing advantage over leftist Bernie Sanders in the contest to battle President Donald Trump.Addressing supporters in Philadelphia as his victory took shape, Biden declared on national television that he would lead ""a comeback for the soul of this nation.""And he reached out to supporters of his sometimes bitter rival Sanders, telling them ""we share a common goal. Together we'll defeat Donald Trump.""Hours earlier, US networks projected a huge victory in Mississippi for Biden, reflecting his popularity among strategically vital African American voters. Then came Missouri.Then, biggest of all, Michigan - one of the industrial Midwestern giants due to be a key battleground in the general election.Three more states were counting votes - Washington, Idaho and North Dakota - but the triumph of former president Barack Obama's vice president was secure.Barring major surprises, Biden now eyes a clear path to becoming the Democrats' candidate in the bruising and deeply divisive November polls.The main question hangs over Sanders, a self-declared democratic socialist.Will he fight on to the bitter end, as he did four years ago against the eventual nominee Hillary Clinton? Or is he set to bow out early?US media reports said Sanders will not speak about the results on Tuesday.But his national press secretary indicated he had no intention of pulling out, touting the candidates' next debate on Sunday as the chance for America to ""see Biden defend his ideas or lack thereof.""Many Democrats blame the firebrand orator and would-be revolutionary for damaging Clinton just as she was struggling - ultimately unsuccessfully - against the Trump insurgency.Adding to nerves in a country on edge after three tumultuous years under Trump, fears of the coronavirus epidemic prompted both campaigns to cancel election-night rallies.Organizers of the upcoming television debate between Sanders and Biden likewise said they would take the extraordinary step of not allowing the usual live audience.Trump's campaign manager dismissed Tuesday's voting, saying ""it has never mattered who the Democratic nominee turns out to be.""Both are ""running on a big government socialist agenda"" and Trump ""is on an unstoppable drive toward re-election,"" campaign manager Brad Parscale said.For Biden, Tuesday's six-state contest, coming a week after his surprise comeback in voting on Super Tuesday, demonstrated that his once shambolic campaign is in rude health and now ready to face Trump.Michigan in particular -- a key battlefield that Trump won in an upset in 2016 -- was targeted by Biden as a place to put down a marker ahead of the November election.Sanders had accused Biden of selling out to corporate interests and ignoring a passionate leftist base.But the former vice president has insisted on steering a centrist line that he says can bring the divided country back together -- and it appears to have paid off.Banking on his credibility as Obama's vice president, he has managed to get out an enthusiastic black vote.But with stories of a hard-knock childhood in Pennsylvania and Delaware frequently featuring in his speeches, Biden also wants to recapture the blue collar white voters that Trump successfully poached from the Democrats in 2016.""Biden is putting together the traditional Democratic coalition, and that's still a very powerful one,"" said Julian Zelizer, a professor of political history at Princeton University and media pundit.In another boost, Andrew Yang became the latest of a string of former rivals for the Democratic nomination to endorse Biden.As the candidate, however, Biden will face an intensely polarized landscape, as illustrated during a campaign stop early Tuesday.Biden was speaking at an under-construction automobile plant in Detroit, when he was confronted by one worker, accusing him of planning to take away Americans' firearms.In the startling exchange, Biden struck back, telling the worker he was ""full of shit"" and insisting that he supports the constitutional right to bear arms.""I'm not taking your gun away,"" he said in the encounter, which Trump supporters quickly pointed to as evidence of Biden's inability to stand pressure - but supporters saw as a show of mettle.Voters came out under the growing shadow of the global coronavirus epidemic, which has infected over 900 people across the United States and killed 28.Sanders and Biden called off customary election-night rallies - both planned in Cleveland, part of another Rust Belt state, Ohio, which votes next week - in line with public health warnings from state officials.Their caution was at odds with Trump, who has vowed to keep holding his campaign's typically raucous rallies despite the concerns about large gatherings.Washington state, which has borne the brunt of the crisis and also was going to the polls Tuesday, votes entirely by mail - an option some experts say should become more widespread as the epidemic grows.",world,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74569425,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-28866,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/biden-says-fighting-for-us-soul-after-big-primary-wins/articleshow/74569438.cms

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The last time Anila P Ajayan , a post-doctoral researcher at Chinese Academy of Sciences , Wuhan went out of her university campus was on January 21, for a farewell dinner for her Pakistani friend Noor-ul-Huda who was planning to go back home after completing her PhD. They saw crowded roads, and people preparing to celebrate their Chinese New Year.Since that day, their days have been confined to their apartment and university lab inside the campus, always on a high alert with frequent screenings, check-ups and daily monitoring. Anila, who hails from Pandalam, is one among the eight foreign students at the academy who chose to stay in Wuhan, the epicentre of the novel coronavirus outbreak She had decided not to take the flight back home even when India evacuated 654 persons from Wuhan on February 1 and 2.In an email interview, Anila P Ajayan said, “I had spent a whole year for the entire process to join as a post-doctoral researcher at the Institute of Hydrobiology, Chinese Academy of Sciences. It was a dream come true when I finally received my visa and air tickets in September 2019. I did not have any second thoughts about returning and I thought, even if I came home, I will be quarantined and my parents will be isolated. It worried me but I think it was the bravest decision I ever took.”Her days under lockdown included moments of fear, anxiety, sense of togetherness and kindness. “My friend Noor's visa was expiring in January last and she was about to fly back home but China government informed her that she can stay till the epidemic is under control without paying any fine… Beyond language, beyond borders she was ready to help me at any time. Between us never did the India-Pakistan political issues come up! We have cared for each other through this tough time and I hope our friendship lasts forever,” she said.Anila, who has already completed 45 days under lockdown, is also all praise for her professor and university administration. “My professor brought me fruits to eat, knowing that I do not eat pork or beef. He also brought home-cooked food for others. Many young boys started delivering masks and essential things to us without any fear... Every day, the progress of viral outbreak is updated and we are given necessary advice. We also receive a steady supply of provisions and facial masks,” she said.The initial days of fear have now given way to hope and recovery. “The number of fatalities have come down, we badly miss our families back home. We don’t know when we can step out, but we find a way here to get together.

The rate of detection of Coronavirus in South Korea is dropping sharply with every passing day,” he said.He said the government of India’s sudden decision to impose travel restrictions to and from South Korea from March 3 has severely impacted business activities.The Union government suspended visas and e-visas granted to people travelling from Italy, Iran, South Korea and Japan after a surge in Covid-19 cases in these countries.“There are 150 Korean companies here in Chennai.

408,['11/03/2020'],Crisis-hit Congress to shift its MLAs out of Madhya Pradesh,"BHOPAL: In a bid to keep its flock together, the crisis-hit Madhya Pradesh Congress has decided to shift its 92 MLAs either to Jaipur or some other place.

The move comes after 22 Congress MLAs loyal to former Union minister Jyotiraditya Scindia resigned on Tuesday, pushing the 15-month-old Kamal Nath government to the brink of collapse.

""We are going to take our 92 MLAs and those supporting our Madhya Pradesh government to a hotel,"" a senior Congress leader said on Wednesday.

The legislators would be taken either to Jaipur or some other Congress-ruled state like Chhattisgarh, a party source said.

Apart from its own MLAs, the Congress is also keeping a close watch on four Independents who are supporting the party-led state government.

On Tuesday, 22 Congress MLAs from Madhya Pradesh resigned soon after Scindia quit the party.

The development reduced the Congress government in the state to minority.

The state Congress unit is now making all efforts to save the Kamal Nath-led government.

The BJP on Tuesday night shifted its MLAs to Manesar at Gurugram in Haryana, sources in the saffron party said.

The Congress, whose tally before the rebellion was 114, has a wafer-thin majority in the Madhya Pradesh Assembly whose current effective strength is 228.

It also has the support of four Independents, two BSP legislators and one SP MLA, but some of them are now likely to switch sides to the BJP.

The BJP has 107 seats in the state assembly.

409,['11/03/2020'],Cholera scare: BBMP intensifies drive against roadside eateries,"Picture for representational purpose only.

BENGALURU: With a spurt in cholera cases in several parts of Bengaluru over the past two weeks, BBMP is on an overdrive, cracking down on illegal roadside eateries and food vendors across the city. Activists, however, see this as a ham-handed and knee-jerk response.

East, south and west zones, all in core Bengaluru areas, reported 25 suspected cases over the past few days. While seven are confirmed cases, 10 have turned negative and results are awaited in eight others, BBMP officials said. The drive against roadside eateries began on Monday morning from Jayanagar . On Tuesday, it was expanded to include several other parts of the city.

Announcing the crackdown on Tuesday afternoon, BBMP commissioner BH Anil Kumar tweeted: “To prevent the spread of cholera & GE, BBMP has shut all roadside eateries & unhygienic kitchens. Request citizens to stop consuming roadside food as they are the source of infections.”

Stalls selling cut fruits, chats, fruit juice and other food tend to use water that is unhygienic which can lead to spread of cholera, BBMP officials said. They also made it clear that there won’t be any let-up in the drive.

Akyab Salman, senior health inspector of Sanjaynagar ward, said, “It’s difficult to send them home as they say it is their only source of income and will affect them badly. But we don’t have a choice. We are doing this for the sake of everyone’s health and safety. As per the current order, the ban on street food joints is permanent and they won’t be allowed to come back unless there are further orders.”

Health inspectors across the city have deployed their officers to make sure no street food is available.

Santosh Raj, junior health inspector of Shantinagar ward, said, “We started removing these eateries on Monday evening on MG Road, Residency Road, Brunton Road and Trinity Circle. So far, we have shut down close to 40 eateries. This not only aids visual cleanliness, but also helps in improving hygiene, considering there is an outbreak of cholera.”

“Some of the vendors listen to us, but most try their best to resist. They say it will directly affect their families as the carts are the only source of their livelihood. We have to explain to them why we are doing it and request them to cooperate,” he added Citizen groups, however, say there could have been a different approach to deal with the situation.

“It appears as if it was a reaction that wasn’t thought through. Issues such as this should be brought up in the council, where they can come together and figure out how this can be dealt with. The city belongs to everyone, including these street vendors,” said Srinivas Alavilli of Citizens for Bengaluru.

S Babu, president, Bengaluru Jilla Beedhi Vyapari Sanghatanegala Okkuta said cholera is a water-borne disease. “Taking a decision to provide cleaner water to the city would have been more appropriate,” he added.

“BBMP won’t be providing compensation or financial assistance despite knowing fully well that these vendors are completely dependent on their small businesses to eke out a living. How do they expect them to lead their lives for the next few days or weeks,” he asked.

The coronavirus is more than a scare with the first championship to be struck off the season being just a notch below the Grand Slams.""It was like we were all out of jobs all of a sudden,"" India's star pro Sania Mirza said of the player community, ""everyone was walking around wondering what was happening.""The 33-year-old, along with her father and coach Imran, took a 16-hour flight from Dubai, which was followed by a three-hour drive to Indian Wells, only to learn that the tournament had been cancelled.On Sunday, before the women's qualifying matches got underway in the California dessert, officials announced that the local Riverside Public Health Department had declared a state of emergency due to the looming Covid-19 threat. For the first time in the tournament's 46-year history it was called off.Besides Sania, India's Davis Cuppers Prajnesh Gunneswaran and Sumit Nagal- who were set to play the qualifiers on Tuesday-had also assembled. Doubles ace Rohan Bopanna , heard of the cancellation en route, in Doha, an hour before he boarded his flight for Los Angeles. After spending some 20-hours in the airport he returned home to Bengaluru early on Tuesday. Ramkumar Ramanathan , who put up a battling show for India in the Davis Cup against Croat Marin Cilic, going down in two tie-break sets, proceeded to Nur-Sultan, Kazakhstan for the $54,160 Challenger tournament. The 24-year-old, however, was forced to pull out of the doubles, as his partner Purav Raja couldn't make it because of visa issues. Divij Sharan has taken a break from competition and is in New Delhi.Sania, who powered India to the Fed Cup World Group play-offs in Dubai last week. After the cancellation of the Indian Wells tournament she and her father drove to San Diego where they'll wait out the next couple of days with family, hoping for some clarity for the rest of the American swing. She will return to Hyderabad on Thursday to reunite with her 18-month old son Izhaan. ""I didn't want to put him on a 16-hour flight in the current situation. It was a tough call to make, but it was what's best for him. It's getting harder for me to leave him, he's beginning to understand. He knows when I'm not around,"" Sania told TOI. ""It's harder on me though. I've been with him all the time, except for a few days in between when I was training.""While there was a sense of outrage among the players as soon as news of the cancellation broke in the form of a mail, the mood gradually changed to health over all else. ""What can you do? What can anyone do? This is not something that's in anyone's control. Obviously it has cost players a lot of money to get here, some of the players are here with big teams. It's been hard on everybody, look at the Chinese, they've not been home this whole time. It can't be easy. It was just the timing of it that came as a shock, a little before the qualies were to be played,"" she said.Sania added, that while players were awaiting news of the Miami tournament which is to be held in two weeks, it was best to look at the positive side. ""At least you're in California, waiting. There could be a lot worse places to be stuck in at the moment,"" she said.",sports,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74569770,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-164046,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//sports/tennis/top-stories/indian-wells-cancellation-it-was-like-we-were-all-out-of-jobs-all-of-a-sudden-says-sania-mirza/articleshow/74569781.cms

It outdid itself in 2019, making a total of 24 deals — a 50% increase from 2018, showed data from Hampleton Partners' IT and business services M&A market report.Accenture's acquisition drive has been an effort to build digital capabilities. It made 53 acquisitions in the last 30 months, including those of Clarity Solution Group that provides data analytics consulting services, and French consulting firm Silveo that offers services and solutions for digital manufacturing and intelligent supply chains.Another key acquisition was of Pragsis Bidoop, a Spanish company with strong expertise in big data, AI and advanced analytics. In the 2019 fiscal year, Accenture invested nearly $1.2 billion on 33 buyouts.Hampleton said in the second half of 2019, transaction volume increased, pushing up to 407 transactions from 380 in the first half of the year. Tech services and support, the largest segment of the IT services sector, accounted for 43% of deals.Dentsu Aegis Network was the second highest acquirer. It sealed 25 deals in the last 30 months, some centered mostly around digital marketing. These included the acquisition of Los Angeles-based direct-to-consumer marketing agency MuteSix that focuses on Facebook and Google advertising services. In joint third place with 16 acquisitions were Deloitte, whose purchases included several data-focused firms, and PE investor Presidio, which entered the top buyer list with a $75 million consolidation of 15 smart home design-build firms.Miro Parizek, founding partner at Hampleton Partners, said, “The migration of core business services to digital and to the cloud, plus widespread implementation of analytics, digital marketing, machine learning, social commerce and more, are creating a strong demand for companies across the sector. Macroeconomic forces are also contributing to M&A activity, as private equity firms can now afford to buy market-leading tech companies with high growth potential, leading to larger deal sizes.”The outsized influence of private equity firms is shown by the $5.4 billion purchase of electronics distributor Tech Data by Apollo Global Management in November 2019.PE buyers represented 15% of all transactions in 2019 compared to just under 5% in 2014. In total, $14.7 billion was spent by private equity buyers in 2019 – an increase from the $11.9 billion spent in 2018.Around 60% of transactions involved a North American target company, while 29% involved a target headquartered in Europe. Of those European companies targeted, 71% were purchased by a European acquirer – a tendency which has remained almost identical to previous periods.",business,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74569778,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-165765,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/accenture-biggest-acquirer-of-companies-in-last-30-months/articleshow/74569767.cms

424,['11/03/2020'],Paraguayan judge orders Ronaldinho to remain in prison,"(Reuters photo)

ASUNCION: Brazilian football great Ronaldinho will remain in pre-trial detention in Paraguay after being refused bail or house arrest on accusations of entering the country with a fake passport .

A court rejected a request for conditional release for the 39-year-old World Cup winner and his brother, who were spending a fifth day in a police cell in Asuncion, said prosecutor Osmar Legal.

Judge Gustavo Amarilla cited the seriousness of the case and the discovery of new evidence, as well as the involvement of public officials and entrepreneurs who facilitated Ronaldinho's arrival in Paraguay.

Amarilla acknowledged the harshness of the measures taken against the brothers but said it was his responsibility to ensure the they did not flee the country.

""The are many procedures that need to be done with the presence of both of them,"" the judge said.

Legal said he opposed house arrest because the property offered as a guarantee was only valued at $750,000 to $800,000.

""It's a tiny amount given the economic solvency of one of the (accused),"" he said.

They arrived in Asuncion from Brazil on Wednesday and showed their passports to immigration police, who did not immediately notice any problem.

Hours later, when the passports were determined to be fake, investigators raided the football star's hotel room and seized the brothers' identity cards and travel documents.

Ronaldinho said the passports had been given to him by people who had invited him to attend conferences sponsored by charities working with disadvantaged children.

A Brazilian businessman has also been arrested in connection with the fake travel documents, while two Paraguayan women have been placed under house arrest and the country's migration director has resigned.

Ronaldinho's Brazilian lawyer Sergio Queiroz has said the brothers were given the Paraguayan passports ""to facilitate the possibility of doing business"" in Paraguay.

""Ronaldinho did not commit a crime because he did not know that the passport they gave him was faked,"" he said.

The administrator of the charity that invited Ronaldinho, Dalia Lopez, has admitted requesting the passports but said she didn't know they were forged.

A warrant has been issued for her arrest.

Amarilla said the investigation is looking into possible criminal association and money laundering.

He said the two brothers' phones need to be examined, in order to ""know the true intention for their presence"" in Paraguay.

Ronaldinho, considered one of the greatest footballers of all time, was a star of Brazil's 2002 World Cup win and played for European giants Barcelona, Paris Saint-Germain and AC Milan, among others.

There had been rumors he needed to use the Paraguayan document because his real passport had been seized by Brazilian authorities in late 2018 after he failed to pay a $2.5 million fine for building a pier in a protected lake.

But it was returned to him a year later following an agreement with the public prosecutor in Rio Grande do Sul state.

428,['11/03/2020'],Ranji Trophy final: Vasavada and Pujara wear Bengal down as Saurashtra take charge,"Arpit Vasavada. (TOI Photo)

RAJKOT: Saurashtra took control of the Ranji Trophy final against Bengal at the SCA Stadium here on Tuesday, thanks to a 142-run sixth-wicket stand between Arpit Vasavada and Cheteshwar Pujara .

On a pitch where the ball is not coming on to the bat and the odd one is keeping low, the two showed tremendous resilience to bat out the first two sessions of the second day.

The Bengal bowlers, like on Day 1, staged a comeback in the last session to capture three wickets, but the hosts were still in a position of strength at 384 for eight. Credit should go to Vasavada and Pujara, who had to battle hard for runs. The fact that only 72 and 61 runs were scored in the first two sessions showed how difficult it was to score.

However, Bengal bowlers were guilty of adopting a negative line despite finishing the opening day strongly. Bengal's game plan actually surprised former India left-arm spinner Dilip Doshi , who was in attendance. ""I felt Bengal did very well to restrict Saurashtra to 206 for five on the first day. But I was surprised to see them bowl a negative line when they should have gone for wickets,"" he stated.

Vasavada rescued the side again, like he did against Gujarat in the semifinal last week. ""I think that innings (semifinal) was very tough as I walked in at 15 for five,"" said Vasavada, referring to his 139 in the second innings versus Gujarat.

The left-hander was so much in command that a Test star like Pujara had to play second fiddle.

With the ball keeping low, Bengal delayed taking the second new ball till the 86th over.

Pujara, who felt unwell and left the field late on Monday, did not look very settled in the early stages of the second day. He was rapped on the pads while giving left-arm spinner Shahbaz Ahmed the charge. Bengal opted for a DRS review, but Pujara survived despite being caught in line since the ball struck him when he was way down the track.

Vasavada hit consecutive fours off Shahbaz to bring up Saurashtra's 300 and reached his second consecutive ton by punching Anushtup Majumdar off the back foot to the cover boundary.

Pujara got to his 50 soon after, cutting Arnab Nandy to the backward point boundary.

Bengal earned the much-needed breakthrough in the fifth over after tea when Vasavada stepped out to defend Shahbaz only to miss the line of a straighter one to be stumped by Wriddhiman Saha .

Pacer Mukesh Kumar then struck in consecutive overs to further boost Bengal. Six overs after Vasavada left, Pujara's marathon knock of 66 off 237 balls, spanning six hours and 17 minutes, came to an end when Mukesh trapped him leg before wicket.

Pujara, who played inside the line to one that cut back a bit and was hit on the back pad, went for a review which was turned down. Mukesh then had Prerak Mankad almost in similar fashion.

429,['11/03/2020'],BS Yediyurappa: Slump in crude prices could mar BS Yediyurappa’s plan to leverage revenues,"Karnataka chief minister BS Yediyurappa

BENGALURU: Chief minister BS Yediyurappa ’s budget proposal to hike motor fuel prices by Rs 1.6 per litre to tide over a severe fund crunch could spectacularly fizzle, thanks to plummeting prices of crude.

Yediyurappa had hoped to mop up additional revenue of about Rs 1,000 crore for the year through the measure. Currently, the state collects about Rs 1,100 crore per month from sale of motor fuels.

The CM had proposed 3% increase in sales tax on petrol (from 32% to 35%) and diesel (21% to 24%). However, since tax on fuels is ad-valorem — calculated on sum of base price and central excise — the hike could have a negligible effect on the state’s coffers. Moreover, fuel prices are likely to drop further in April when the new rates kick in.

Experts suggest that if the trend continues, the government could get even less revenue from motor fuel than it is currently collecting.

“It is a farcical situation as the government was roundly criticised for hiking tax rates, but it may not benefit from the decision,” said BT Manohar, taxation committee chairman of Federation of Karnataka Chambers of Commerce.

When Yediyurappa tabled his budget on March 5, the base price of a litre of petrol was Rs 33.5 per litre. Sales tax amounted to Rs 17.1 (32% on base price + central excise of Rs 20). Including dealer commission (Rs 3.3), a litre of petrol retailed at Rs 73.9.

Since then, the base price has dipped to Rs 32.6 as the prices of crude slumped from $48 per barrel to $34.4 before rising to $37.2 on Tuesday. Sales tax fell to Rs 16.8 while retail price of petrol fell to Rs 72.7 per litre. Industry experts expect crude prices to fall to $29 per barrel by April 1, which will result in an even bigger fall in the sale tax component.

“We won’t be surprised if Yediyurappa announces another tax hike even before the first is implemented,” said KM Basave Gowda, president, Akhila Karnataka Federation of Petroleum Dealers .

Adding to the problem is the reduction in consumption. For reasons including economic slowdown and the coronavirus scare, consumption of diesel and petrol has fallen by 30% and 10% respectively. A fuel outlet in Bengaluru generally sells about 6,000 litres of diesel and 4,000 litres of petrol daily, but those figures have fallen to 4,200 and 3,600 respectively, petroleum dealers say.

Trying to allay fears of another tax hike, a senior official in the finance department said the government is not in favour of raising tax rates frequently.

“We are keenly watching the fluctuation in crude oil prices. So far, oil companies in the country have not reduced the base price remarkably. If they do reduce the base price substantial, then we will take a call accordingly,” said the official.

430,['11/03/2020'],Rory McIlroy chasing first back-to-back at Players Championship,"(AFP photo)

PONTE VERDA BEACH, UNITED STATES: Rory McIlroy has his eye on a piece of PGA Tour history this week as he targets a successful defense of The Players Championship .

The world number one arrives at Ponte Vedra Beach , Florida aiming to become the first player to go back-to-back at TPC Sawgrass.

""I don't think you ever need an extra motivation when you come to this golf tournament, but to be the first one to defend here would be very cool,"" McIlroy told reporters on Tuesday.

McIlroy will tee off on Thursday after an encouraging start to the season that has seen him post five top-five finishes in six starts.

He was in the hunt for victory at last weekend's Arnold Palmer Invitational but slid out of contention after two double-bogeys on the final round.

Nevertheless, the Northern Irishman sees similarities between his start to this season and last year, when he bagged the first of four wins in 2019 at The Players after a run of consistent performances.

""It's nice to be back,"" McIlroy said. ""A lot of similarities between this year and last year in terms of how I've played the first few events of the year, given myself some chances, haven't quite been able to capitalize, and yeah, obviously would be wonderful to replicate what happened last year.""

Webb Simpson, the 2018 Players Champion, will not be surprised if McIlroy ends up walking away with the $2.7 million winner's cheque this weekend.

Simpson believes the 30-year-old McIlroy is comfortably the world's best player.

""Not needing to say this, but he's certainly the best player in the world right now,"" Simpson said. ""He's floated in and out of the best player in the world for his whole career it seems like.

""His bad play and bad stretches is better than most every guy out here. And when he's playing his best, he's hard to beat.

""He's already created the opinion that he's going to go down as one of the great players ever in golf, which is great for him, great for us, great for our Tour. He's one of those guys that you expect to be in contention every week.""

This week's tournament -- often described as golf's fifth unofficial major -- is taking place against the backdrop of the coronavirus crisis that has decimated the global sporting landscape.

PGA Tour commissioner Jay Monahan said the tour had set up a task force of officials who were monitoring the outbreak on a day-to-day basis.

""I think it goes without saying that the health, safety, wellbeing of our players, our fans, our tournaments, everybody that's involved in our ecosystem is of utmost importance,"" Monahan said.

KOLKATA: Dream big and support fearlessly. That was Kibu Vicuna's message after taking charge as Mohun Bagan coach at the start of this season.

Eight months down the line, the Spaniard has achieved what he had set out to do - guide Bagan to the summit in their final I-League season.

Lifting the trophy is hugely satisfying but it's the manner in which Bagan have gone about their business that has left everyone awe-struck. The quality of football they have dished out, their dominance, the consistency and the pursuit to get better - the green and maroons have simply been in a league of their own.

Bagan's campaign can be compared to Usain Bolt's 100m dash - not the quickest off the blocks, but smooth sailing once they got into a rhythm.

Bagan had nothing to show for in terms of silverware in their first three tournaments of the season - CFL Premier Division A, Durand Cup and Sheikh Kamal International Club Cup in Bangladesh. And when they started their ILeague campaign with a draw versus Aizawl FC and a 2-4 defeat to Churchill Brothers at home, fans doubted whether Bagan could be serious title challengers this season.

The pressure was squarely on Kibu, but the 48-year-old Spanish coach was convinced that the team was on right track and remained upbeat about bouncing back. And what a turnaround it proved to be! They have not lost a game since that Churchill debacle, their 13-match unbeaten run rewriting the club record.

433,['11/03/2020'],'Political crisis in Madhya Pradesh could have been averted',"Jyotiraditya Scindia

BENGALURU: Senior state Congress functionaries say the political crisis in Madhya Pradesh , triggered by the exit of Jyotiraditya Scindia from the party, could have been averted if the central leadership had taken measures to check defections and desertions.

There was enough warning, they say, since events in MP mirrored what transpired in Goa and Karnataka last year. But the central leadership was found wanting and young MLAs are now feeling demoralised and directionless, they say. State Congress functionaries say the danger is bound to spread to Maharashtra and Rajasthan too.

“It is this inexplicable unwillingness to act in time that has crippled the party at the national level and in almost every state,” said a senior functionary who is aspiring to be the next KPCC president.

A lot of the lethargy stems from the party’s inability to appoint a full-time president at the national level — to replace Sonia Gandhi — and in Karnataka — to take over from Dinesh Gundurao , who quit in December last year.

“If the party had acted quickly to appoint a fullfledged president, we could possibly have prevented Scindia from leaving. If DK Shivakumar had been appointed party chief in Karnataka, he [Shivakumar] would have at least tried to rescue the rebels,” said another senior functionary, adding that the delay has splintered the party.

In a series of tweets, legislator NA Haris accused his party of not working hard enough. “There was a time when I was proud to say I’m a Congress worker. But not any more. The party has become inactive and this is a dangerous development for the country. The party is not doing justice to any issues dogging this country,” he tweeted.

In another tweet, he said the BJP is growing in strength by the day and if Congress continues to ignore capable leaders and loyal workers, it will prove costly. “The thinking in the party itself should change. It should start thinking that the future of the country lies in the party and it should look to fight communal forces,” he tweeted.

Gundurao said it is time for Rahul Gandhi to crack the whip. “Whatever may happen in Madhya Pradesh, one thing is clear. It’s time for RahulGandhi to lead from the front. We can’t go on like this,” he said in a tweet.

435,['11/03/2020'],Narendra Modi: How PM Modi won India's elections but paralyzed economy: Nikkei Asian Review,"Prime Minister Narendra Modi (File photo)

NEW DELHI: In its latest cover story, Japan's Nikkei Asian Review said that Prime Minister Narendra Modi might have won the elections but his policies have paralyzed India's economy. It focuses on how his party's thumping victories in 2014 and 2019 (with a bigger mandate) have not helped in solving India's economic crisis.

Excerpts from the article:

-""The political and economic crises are tightly interwoven. When Narendra Modi became prime minister at the head of the Bharatiya Janata Party in 2014, he promised to do for India what he did for his home state of Gujarat, where he had presided over an economic growth spurt.""

-""That boom failed to materialise during his first term, which was marred by a botched rollout of a sales tax and the cancellation of most bank notes -- which, in cash-centric India, hit particularly hard. Regardless, he was reelected with a huge majority in 2019.""

-""What Modi did carry over from his time in Gujarat, though, was intercommunity violence. In 2002, while Modi ran the state, at least 1,000 people died in clashes between Hindus and Muslims.""

- ""... instead of using its mandate to tackle the mounting economic challenges, Modi's government has doubled down on Hindutva, its populist, Hindu nationalist agenda. Backed by the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, a Hindu ultranationalist group seen as an ideological driving force behind Hindutva, it has revoked Jammu and Kashmir's autonomous status, changed the country's citizenship laws to deny recognition to Muslim immigrants from neighboring countries, and tried to enforce Hinduism as central to India's values and identity. Almost all of the government's political capital has been thrown into this massive social project. Economic reform has fallen by the wayside.""

-""'Prime Minister Modi won the election,' said an executive at a Mumbai venture capital fund. ""But he lost the economy.""

Boom to bust

-""The signs of India's economic decay are visible in the commercial hub of Mumbai. Cranes atop the skeletons of residential towers have been stationary for months, as developers struggle to win credit in the face of lackluster demand.""

-""In the countryside are similar signs of suspended activity. Demand for big-ticket purchases such as tractors has softened, while sales of even the cheapest everyday items have been weak.""

Some were heading to homes without internet, leaving them to wonder if they could keep up with online classes. And some worried about finding a way to afford a flight on only a few days' notice.As dozens of universities cancel in-person classes and move instruction online amid fears over the new coronavirus , thousands of students are left scrambling to find their way home while their professors puzzle over how to move weeks of courses to the internet.Schools nationwide announced plans to cancel in-person classes through spring break or beyond amid fears about the virus' spread. Some are pausing campus classes for a few days or weeks, including Columbia, Princeton and Indiana University , while others are canceling classes through the end of the term, including Stanford and Harvard On Tuesday, Harvard undergraduates were told to leave campus by Sunday and stay home until the end of the semester. The abrupt order drew outrage from students who are also juggling midterm exams, senior projects and daily classes.Harvard student Silvana Gomez didn't know how she would afford to return on such short notice to her family's home in West New York, New Jersey. Gomez, a junior studying psychology, also worries about the risk she could pose to her father, who is 66 and has a health condition that could make him more vulnerable to the virus.""It's terrifying.

It's a rural area, he said, and the closest internet access is at the county's only Starbucks, miles from his home.""We are really panicking right now, and a lot of students have anxiety,"" he said. ""A lot of us woke up this morning to a very ominous email that's essentially evicting us from campus.""Stores were selling out of boxes near Harvard, one of several schools including Amherst College and St. John's University that asked students to move out of student housing and finish their courses for the year from home. Others, like Princeton University, are temporarily moving to online learning, even for students who remain on campus, and telling them to prepare for tight restrictions on social activities.Yale University also told students that classes will be moved online following the end of spring break. Students were also encouraged to move back home as soon as Sunday and not to travel abroad in an effort to stop the spread of the virus.With more campuses canceling classes by the day, the potential impact looms large into the spring for final exams, new student tours and graduation ceremonies.For most people, the coronavirus causes only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia. The vast majority of people recover from the new virus.Dan King, president of the American Association of University Administrators, predicted ""many, many more"" colleges will move learning online as campuses work to contain the virus and the anxiety around it.At Amherst College, senior Tommy Mobley said news that classes were moving online for the rest of the semester was met with disappointment and panic as students scrambled to move off campus while wondering whether they would ever return.""There were just hundreds of students on their phones, there were students crying. You know, a lot of students seemed panicked and a lot of students seemed devastated by the news because, frankly, it's very shocking. And it's a major change,"" said Mobley, 23, from Newton, Massachusetts.As professors scramble to prepare online lessons, they have a long list of concerns. Without personal contact, some wonder how they'll know if students are falling behind. Some worry students won't participate in online discussions. And there are concerns about how to offer fair exams in an online setting.At Columbia University , Vincent Racaniello plans to teach his virology class through live video lectures that students can also watch later on YouTube. But he'll miss being able to walk around the lecture hall and look students in the eye to gauge if they're following along.""The best part of lecturing is the contact,"" said Racaniello, a professor of microbiology and immunology. ""I really do enjoy going and talking to the students. Afterward, they come down to ask questions. We walk to the subway together. It's all part of the educational experience, and that is hard to lose.""He expects the virus to continue spreading among students anyway.""Students are still going to be moving around the world, they're going to be moving around New York City, they're going to get infected,"" he said. ""I think it has minimal benefit in the long run and is more disruptive than it's worth.""At Fordham University, Rory Varrato said his philosophy classes, which rely heavily on classroom discussion, will likely become more like lectures as he moves to a video conference. He said he expects he'll take it easier on students when it comes to grading this term, given the unusual circumstances caused by the virus.""My hunch is that I will be more flexible, just recognizing it's likely that some students will become ill or have an increased stress level in general,"" he said. ""I'll definitely take all of that into consideration.""At New York University , which is moving to online classes starting on Wednesday, sophomore Mareda Michael, 19, wondered whether she would get her tuition's worth.""We're paying so much to go to this school, to not have the school experience is a waste of money,"" said Michael, who was weighing whether to go home to Los Angeles, California.At Harvard, students were told only a number of exceptions would be made for the orders to leave campus, primarily for international students who come from countries that have been hit hardest by the virus. Students were encouraged to raise any issues with housing officials or their faculty deans, said Harvard spokeswoman Rachael Dane.""We are working individually with them to meet their needs and ensure they are supported in this transition,"" Dane said in a statement.Sophomore Lucy Wickings is requesting to stay on campus during the closure but doesn't know if she will qualify. Wickings, 19, is homeless and has been saving income from three campus jobs to stay afloat over the summer. Now she fears she'll have to use her savings during the closure to cover meals and for travel to stay with a classmate's family.""College for me is the place where I'm supposed to be getting stable housing and food,"" said Wickings, who is originally from Port Huron, Michigan. ""I'm not really sure what to do. I figure I'll start packing today just in case.""",world,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74570126,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-131176,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/us-college-campuses-empty-as-coronavirus-scare-pushes-learning-online/articleshow/74570095.cms

BENGALURU: When reports first emerged in early 2019 that the BJP was close to toppling the JD(S)-Congress coalition government in Karnataka, Mahadevpura legislator and former minister Aravind Limbavali was considered the cog in the saffron party’s bid.

It was even speculated that Limbavali, under the Dalit quota, would be elevated to deputy chief minister if BS Yediyurappa came to power. His political capital was at its peak.

Then, Limbavali slid spectacularly from grace, thanks to a flurry of political developments. A controversial sex video in which he allegedly featured and which was leaked on social media, hit his prospects the hardest. Indcidentally, a forensics report said the tape is a fake, but the damage had been done by then.

When the video surfaced and when questions about it swirled, the four-time legislator wept in the legislative assemblywhile demanding an independent investigation into the issue. It suggested his stock had hit rock bottom, even as rumours indicated it was a bid from within the party to cut him down to size.

The timing was bad for Limbavali as a no-confidence motion was moved against the coalition government and Yediyurappa was subsequently sworn in as CM. Limbavali was completely sidelined and has been sulking since.

The Madhya Pradesh crisis, however, has come as a blessing, as it gives him a chance to revive his career. Limbavali has been entrusted with the task of shepherding the 19 rebel MLAs, who are holed up in a hotel located in his constituency.

Taking a leaf out of Congress troubleshooter DK Shivakumar’s book, Limbavali has not only successfully kept the flock of rebels together, but has also shielded them from a prying media and Congress glare.

The ‘operation’ to get Congress legislators to cross over began on February 20 when Limbavali was summoned to Delhi and given charge to safeguard legislators. The first batch of four rebel Congress MLAs arrived in Bengaluru on March 4. That figure went up to 19 by March 9. “Limbavali was in constant touch with central leaders on a daily basis,” said a senior functionary, revealing only Yediyurappa was in the loop locally.

Shivakumar too had parked legislators from Gujarat during Rajya Sabha elections, and later JD(S)- Congress MLAs, in 2018, in Bengaluru Rural — which is represented by his brother DK Suresh in the Lok Sabha.

“Considering his experience and his role in bringing the BJP to power, Limbavali was handpicked by the party leadership to safeguard the MLAs. He is using it to his advantage to emerge as BJP’s troubleshooter, a tag Shivakumar had earned in Congress,” a Limbavali aide said.

If the operation is successful, Limbavali is hoping to be rewarded with a prominent berth in Yediyurappa’s cabinet when it is expanded, perhaps in April.

Telescopic fares proposed for kaali-peelis

Transport Dept wants app-based cabbies to dress up– black trousers, sky-blue shirt with a tie and black shoes.Thehas decided to introduce a cap on app-based cabs’ surge pricing, bringing much needed relief toAccording to a new set of regulations proposed by a committee chaired by retired IAS officer B C Khatua – and now accepted by the Transport Department – app-based taxi services will not be allowed to surge their fares beyond three times of what black-and-yellow cabs charge.Currently, black-and-yellow cabs charge Rs 14.85 per km. This means,and’s maximum surge fare will not be allowed to exceed Rs 44.55 per km. During the 2017 deluge, some of the app based cabs charged up to Rs 65 per km.The new fare regime will come into force once the state cabinet approves it. A senior State Transport Department officer, who did not wish to be identified, said the file has been sent for the cabinet’s approval.The Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR) has close to 80,000 app-based cabs and 42,000 black-and-yellow, popularly referred to as kaali-peelis. Nearly 4,000 of the kaali-peelis are also registered with app-based taxi operators.While the Transport Department has left the rest of app-based cabs’ fare structure untouched, it has proposed telescopic fare pricing for kaali-peelis. Currently, the base fare of a kaali-peeli is Rs 22 and after that every km covered costs a customer Rs 14.85. The Transport Department has proposed two distance slabs -- 8 km to 12 km and beyond 12 km. In the first slab, per km fare will go down by 15 per cent – it will be Rs 12.63 per km from 8 km to 12 km. It will reduce by 20 per cent in the second slab – so, it will be Rs 11.88 per km from 13 km and beyond.Under the new regulations, drivers of app-based cabs will also have a uniform like their counterparts driving kaali-peelis. While kaali-peeli drivers dress in khakis, app-based cab drivers will have to wear black trousers, sky blue shirt with a tie and black shoes.Sources in the Transport Department said that since app-based cabs are airconditioned, the ties would not cause the drivers any discomfort in the muggy Mumbai weather.Both Ola and Uber on Tuesday refused to comment on the proposed regulations citing Holi holiday. Unions representing kaali-peelis said they would comment only after the Transport Department sends them an official communication.",mumbai,"https://static.toiimg.com/photo/imgsize-243568,msid-74568037/74568037.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/cap-on-uber-ola-surge-fares-soon/articleshow/74570141.cms
445,['11/03/2020'],East Bengal accuse Kashmir bench of racial abuse,"East Bengal's Victor Perez (right) celebrates with teammates after converting the penalty against Real Kashmir... Read More

KOLKATA: East Bengal accused the Real Kashmir reserve bench of racially abusing one of their players during the 1-0 win in Srinagar on Monday.

Victor Perez's stoppage-time penalty pushed the red and golds up to second place in I-League and dealt a decisive blow to Real Kashmir's slim title hopes.

""I heard someone from the Real Kashmir bench calling a coloured player of my team 'f*****g m****y'. This is absolutely unacceptable,"" East Bengal coach Mario Rivera said after the match.

Asked whether he would lodge a complaint, Rivera added: ""I think both the match commissioner and the referee were close by when that chant was made. It's up to them to take a call.""

It was an ill-tempered clash with two Real Kashmir players and one from East Bengal being sent off. Real Kashmir were reduced to 10 men in the 38th minute when local hero Danish Farooq , already on a booking, was cautioned for a diving simulation.

All hell broke loose during stoppage time when Juan Vera drew a foul from Kashmir defender Loveday Enyinnaya inside the box, resulting in the penalty and Perez converted it with ease.

However, irked by referee Umesh Bora 's decision, a fan rushed out to the pitch and tried to confront the match official. As Kashmir players tried to stop the intruder, home team's Kallum Higginbotham and East Bengal's Lalrindika Edmund got involved in a scuffle and both were shown the red card by Bora.

When the match officials were leaving the field, local fans clapped sarcastically.

Rivera later said: ""Real Kashmir players turned a football match into a wrestling match. Luckily, all my players were alive and not injured.""

Real Kashmir officials also said that they would lodge a complaint with the AIFF for Bora's handling of the match.

Kromah's woes continue:

Having been released by East Bengal, Ansumana Kromah's season seems to be over. The Liberian striker wanted to join Punjab FC but is unlikely to get permission to play for them this season.

According to AIFF rules, a player can play for a maximum of two clubs per season. Before joining East Bengal, Kromah helped Peerless SC win the CFL Premier Division A title.

Justifying his decision to release the striker, Rivera said: ""Kromah is not a good player for the dressing room. He created a lot of problem after the TRAU match and couldn't be a good member of the family.""

It was an external lecture, one of the many that is held at the institute, and was not organised by the management. ""Several departments or students invite speakers from all walks of life to deliver lectures; this must have been one of those,"" an IISc member said.

Titled 'Polygamy, sexual selection and terrorism ', the lecture was to be delivered by KN Ganeshaiah, writer and retired professor from the University of Agricultural Sciences . As soon as screenshots of the abstract found their way to social media, a slew of commentators responded, slamming Ganeshaiah as Islamophobic and sexist.

None of those who branded Ganeshaiah had heard him speak and the comments were based on the abstract, which talks about polygamy, female foeticide , economic and social backwardness as some of the factors contributing to terrorism.

""...Polygamy and female foeticide could be strong contributors to the ground army required for terrorist activities. I illustrate this with a strong spatial and anthropological association between polygamy, female foeticide and terrorism,"" the abstract's last paragraph reads.

However, following criticism, Ganeshaiah was told on Tuesday, 2pm, his lecture had been cancelled.

449,['11/03/2020'],"Maharashtra government gives Ola, Uber immunity in ‘complaints against one-two drivers’","MUMBAI: The state government on Monday issued a GR that’s in line with most of the recommendations of the B C Khatau Committee, set up to look into surge pricing by aggregators following demands from unions and passengers.The GR stated that all aggregator cabs should convert to CNG or other ‘green fuel’ in a year and sport daffodil yellow colour bands, while the drivers should wear a uniform—light blue shirts, tie and black trousers. The life span of aggregator cabs will be 10 years, it added. However, Ola and Uber have got some immunity by the panel recommendations as action cannot be taken against them if passengers complain against one or two drivers, the GR says.On aggregator cab fares, the GR said, “The committee had recommended a floor price of Rs 14 and ceiling price of Rs 26 for a standard taxi, Rs 16-32 range for mid-sized taxi, and Rs 16-38 range for premium taxis. The state has rejected this surge price model. It has approved of new surge pricing, which should not be more than three times the kaali-peeli fare for that distance.”It added that fare hikes be given “only in situation of rapid rise of fuel cost. Hence, for ease of quick action, the hike of fuel cost by 25% should trigger the fare review rather than 20% of all costs”, and should be with effect from May 1.The government has been trying to cap surge pricing by aggregator cabs for the last few years without much success. The previous BJP-led government had introduced the City Taxi Scheme, but it could not be implemented as aggregators moved the high court and the matter was sub judice.Former transport minister Diwakar Raote from Shiv Sena had set up the Khatua committee to look into surge pricing by aggregators following demands from kaali-peeli unions and passengers. The GR is being viewed as a way to appease them, but a section of the industry feels that it a ‘balancing act’ by the government as the ‘cap’ set up for aggregators too is ‘huge’.“The GR is out, but there are some issues that need to be ironed out for which we will be meeting all stakeholders next week and a final decision will be taken,” state transport minister Anil Parab told TOI, adding that fare hike for autos and taxis will take minimum one year to be implemented.Another recommendation that has got the state nod is telescopic fare for kaali-peeli taxis, which means fare will reduce as distance increases. The panel had recommended regular fare for up to 8-km distance, a 15% drop in fare for 8.1-12km distance, and 20% drop for distances beyond 12 km.There is, however, some bad news for passengers. The GR has rejected the panel’s Happy Hour Scheme under which passengers pay 15% discounted fares during lean hours—noon to 4 pm.On black-and-yellow taxis, the GR said their life span will decrease to 15 years from 20, and there could be a drop in prepaid fares from domestic and international airports-—from 20-33% to 10-20%. The 20% extra fare for AC taxi ride may also be reduced.Unions are upset with a few rules in the GR, including scrapping of the recommendation of a minimum 10-year stay in Maharashtra to get a permit under City Taxi Scheme, and at least three years for a driver’s badge. “This recommendation was not in line with Sena’s son-of-the-soil agenda and so was rejected,” said an official. Rules stipulate a 15-year domicile. The GR also made mandatory LED indicators atop taxis and autos, need to identify more taxi routes, provision for more taxiauto stands and removal of the exorbitant permit fee of Rs 2.6 lakh in the City Taxi Scheme.",mumbai,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74570236,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-132931,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-government-gives-ola-uber-immunity-in-complaints-against-one-two-drivers/articleshow/74570245.cms

CHENNAI: Hampered by the departure of key players and injuries in the squad, it's been a difficult season for Chennai City FC so far. They began the I-League campaign as defending champions, but haven't been able to repeat their incredible feats of previous season and are currently languishing at seventh in the table.

There is a chance for the CCFC players, though, to give a good account of themselves in the AFC Cup. They will be making their debut in the tournament at the Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium here on Wednesday when they take on Maldivian club Maziya Sports & Recreation Club.

""Everybody is excited to play in the AFC Cup. We are not at all thinking about the I-League at the moment. All of us are motivated, especially since we are getting to play in Chennai. It is not difficult being buoyed for such a game,"" CCFC coach Akbar Nawas said at the pre-match press conference on Tuesday.

CCFC are well aware that they have an enormous task in front of them. Their opponents, Maziya, have entered the group stage on the back of beating Bengaluru FC in the second preliminary round.

""We have to give Maziya a lot of respect because they have beaten BFC, a team which has excellent domestic and foreign players. So it will be a big challenge for us to beat Maziya,"" Nawas said.

With only four foreign players - Roberto Eslava , Fito, Nauzet Santana and Katsumi Yusa - at their disposal owing to injuries to Jan Muzangu, CCFC don't have much of a choice when it comes to selection.

For Maziya, who are current league champions in Maldives, there are no such concerns. They have all their players available and are full of confidence, as their coach Marjan Sekulovski stressed on more than one occasion.

""Confidence is never an issue for my players. We have won the league back home and are confident of putting up a good show in the AFC Cup,"" Sekulovski said.

MUMBAI: A Borivli resident was convicted and sentenced to two years rigorous imprisonment after an illegal construction in his house led to a wall collapse that killed his neighbour's three-year-old daughter in 2009.

Finding the accused, Sadhuram Pal (41), guilty, the magistrate said, ""It is proved that without taking care of the lives of others, Pal was constructing his house due to which Jyoti lost her life.""

Pal was found guilty under section 304 A of the Indian Penal Code which deals with causing death by negligence. The maximum sentence under this is two years imprisonment.

The deceased child's father, grandmother and uncle deposed, telling the court that fearing such an incident they had requested him to stop work. However, Pal did not pay heed and continued constructing the first floor which was unauthorised.

The child's father, Sanjay Rajbhar, and his family lived at Ganpat Patil Nagar. Rajbhar told the police that a common wall stood between his house and Pal's. He said that on August 20, 2009, around 1.30 pm, the wall collapsed and fell on the tin roof of his house. Rajbhar said that the roof collapsed and left his daughter, mother and brother injured. Jyoti was trapped under the debris. She was taken to hospital where she was pronounced dead. An FIR was lodged and the accused was arrested on August 27. The same day he was granted bail.

456,['11/03/2020'],"Afghanistan set to release 1,500 Taliban prisoners; US wants less violence","KABUL: After a series of delays, Afghan President Ashraf Ghani issued a decree early Wednesday promising to release 1,500 Taliban prisoners as a goodwill gesture to get intra-Afghan negotiations started, even though a deal signed by the United States and the Taliban calls for the release of up to 5,000 prisoners ahead of the much sought after negotiations.

There was no immediate response from the Taliban.

The decree went on to say the first round of 1,500 prisoners will be selected based on age, health and the length of their sentences already served. The released prisoners, who will be biometrically identified, will also have to give a written guarantee that they will not return to the battlefield.

The remaining 3,500 prisoners will be released after intra-Afghan negotiations begin and 500 will be released every two weeks providing the Taliban reduce violence on the battlefield.

However, even if the Taliban agree to start negotiations, Kabul's political turmoil and relentless bickering between Ghani and his main rival, Abdulllah Abdullah , who has also sworn himself in as Afghanistan 's president, have left Kabul struggling to come up with a united negotiating team.

Ghani's decree came as the US State Department issued a statement saying that the level of violence is ""unacceptable,"" and that while the Taliban have stopped attacks against the US-led coalition forces and in Afghan cities, the violence in the countryside remains too high.

The statement also said Afghanistan's ""presidential electoral crisis"" — an apparent reference to the two inaugurations and political chaos — has delayed the establishment of a national negotiating team and the start of intra-Afghan talks, which were to begin on Tuesday in Oslo, Norway.

Despite the political chaos in Kabul and increased violence on the battlefield, the United States has started withdrawing its troops in keeping with the deal it signed on Feb. 29 with the Taliban. In the first phase, Washington will reduce its troops contingent to 8,600, down from the current 13,000.

If the Taliban adhere to their commitments to deny terrorists safe havens in Afghanistan, Washington will withdraw the remainder of its troops over 14 months, according to the agreement.

When it was signed, the US-Taliban deal was touted as Afghanistan's best chance at finding peace after 40 years of relentless war while offering the United States an exit after nearly 19 years and its longest war.

President Donald Trump has expressed increasing frustration with the Afghan government and its security forces' inability to police and manage their own affairs. But almost from the beginning the unraveling began as the Taliban returned to the battlefield and Afghanistan's politicians stepped up their feuding as Washington's Special Envoy Zalmay Khalilzad scrambled to find a way out of the impasse.

In the end, both Ghani and Abdullah declared themselves president. The United States and other international players attended Ghani's ceremony while urging both men to negotiate a single government.

They will be individually screened on the tarmac for coronavirus.

Alitalia said it would operate only domestic flights from the smaller Milan Linate airport until at least April 3.A fierce debate is on within Air India whether the airline should continue flying to Italy and South Korea capital Seoul.“Our twice weekly flights from Delhi to Rome and Milan each are going almost empty and we have full loads flying back. There is great risk of infection while flying people back from Italy. Although people from Italy and South Korea need a heath certificate saying they are corona-free to be allowed to enter India, whether someone is infected with this flu is known only after 14 days.

464,['11/03/2020'],"Coronavirus in US: US coronavirus cases surge past 1,000, death toll rises to 28","WASHINGTON: The number of novel coronavirus cases in the US surged past 1,000 on Tuesday, after public health experts criticized authorities for downplaying the epidemic and lagging behind in testing efforts.At least 28 people have died and 1,025 people have been infected, according to a running tally by Johns Hopkins University -- nearly double the 550 total confirmed cases the day before.The rise is linked to an expansion in testing as the bulk of diagnoses have shifted from federal to state laboratories.Epidemiologists have said faulty test kits coupled with a diagnostic strategy that initially targeted too few people allowed the disease to spread beyond US authorities' ability to detect it.The failings had contributed to the virus taking root across the country, academics from Johns Hopkins University and Stanford University wrote in the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) on Monday.Vice President Mike Pence defended the government's response at a White House briefing and said that ""a million tests are in the field."" He said that more would be added as the government partnered with private companies.Just over 8,500 tests had been performed as of Monday, according to the latest figures from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).South Korea announced its first case on the same day as the United States, has tested more than 189,000 people in the same period, Business Insider reported.The JAMA report authors wrote that the only test initially authorized was one developed by the CDC.It relied on the same technology as one authorized by the World Health Organization (WHO) and deployed around the world -- except that a fault meant the CDC kit was returning inconclusive results.It was not until February 29, the date of the first US death and more than a month after the first confirmed US case, that the Food and Drug Administration lifted a ban on state laboratories developing their own kits based on the WHO's tests.""Adopting broader testing criteria and allowing use of a wider range of tests would have been helpful in identifying the first US cases and containing the spread,"" said Michelle Mello of Stanford, a co-author of the JAMA report.""Manufacturing problems like the one that arose with CDC's test are always a risk, but the fact that CDC put all its eggs in that one basket made the manufacturing snafu highly consequential,"" she wrote on her university's blog page.The CDC was initially only testing people with known exposure, meaning a Californian patient on a ventilator was denied the test for five days, the patient's doctors said.

NEW DELHI: As many as 22 Congress MLAs loyal to former Union minister Jyotiraditya Scindia resigned on Tuesday, pushing the 15-month-old Kamal Nath government to the brink of collapse.The resignations came close on the heels of Scindia himself exiting the Congress, telling party chief Sonia Gandhi it was time for him to ""move on"". There are reports that Scindia could join BJP in Delhi on Wednesday and file his nomination for Rajya Sabha on March 13.Seventeen of the MLAs who have resigned are from the Scindia faction, and two were already incommunicado. Three others joined them, including one brought back from Bengaluru. BJP promptly took the resignations to Speaker NP Prajapati, who said he would take a decision only after legal opinion.In the House of 230, two seats are vacant after the death of Congress MLA Banwarilal Sharma from Jaura assembly seat and BJP MLA Manohar Utwal from Agar-Malwa constituency.If the resignations are accepted, it will reduce Congress's strength in the 230-member assembly to 92, and BJP, with 107 MLAs, could stake claim to form the government. There were also reports of an SP and a BSP MLA - who have so far supported the Congress government - meeting Shivraj Singh Chouhan, the three-time BJP CM.Two BJP MLAs are said to be in touch with chief minister Kamal Nath and have reportedly offered to resign. Upon probable disqualification after defection by these two BJP MLAs, the strength of the House may further reduce to 226.

LYON: Lyon will take on Juventus in the second leg of their Champions League last-16 tie behind closed doors in Turin next week, the French club's president Jean-Michel Aulas told AFP on Tuesday.

Italy has put a stop to all sporting events taking place until April 3 in a country-wide lockdown aimed at slowing the deadly coronavirus outbreak that has killed 631 people in just over two weeks, but competitions which fall under international jurisdiction can be held.

""We have received a letter from UEFA which tells us that the match will be in Turin and behind closed doors,"" Aulas said to AFP.

Lyon will travel to face the Serie A leaders Juve at the Allianz Stadium on March 17 with a 1-0 lead from the first leg in France and with no home fans to create a hostile atmosphere as they aim to reach the quarter-finals.

""We will take precautions. We will only go to Turin on the day of the match. It is 45 minutes by plane from Lyon,"" added Aulas.

""We will check the players before travelling there and back. We are also going to disinfect the hotel where we will go before the game.""

Atalanta's 4-3 win over Valencia in Spain in the Champions League on Tuesday was played behind closed doors, while no fans will be allowed to attend Wednesday's game between Paris Saint-Germain and Borussia Dortmund in France.

Next week's games between Bayern Munich and Chelsea in Germany and between Barcelona and Napoli in Spain will also go ahead behind closed doors.

Juventus seemed unaffected by the lack of home support at the weekend as they beat Inter Milan 2-0 in a ghostly atmosphere, their last Serie A match until the government withdraws its current decree.

Lyon will have to play their domestic matches behind closed doors until April 15 following a decision by the French football league on Tuesday.

A 26-year-old man was allegedly dropped to his death from his 11th floor rented accommodation inby three of his flatmates over. The incident took place in the wee hours of Tuesday morning. The trio, who reportedly fled from the scene after committing the crime, later surrendered before Kondhwa, confessing their involvement in the killing. The three, all of them engineering students, have been arrested by Kondhwa police. The deceased has been identified as Sagar Chilveri (26), a resident of Kul Utsav Society, Kondhwa Budruk.Abhinabhav Jadhav, Akshay Gorade and Tejash Gujar, the three accused in the case, shared their apartment with Sagar. Some three months ago, the deceased had supposedly borrowed Rs 15,000 from Abhinabhav and promised to return the sum by March with a 10 per cent interest. However, since Sagar was without a job, he was unable to stick to his work. The lapse in payment angered Abhinabhav, who decided to “teach Sagar a lesson”. He, along with the other two flatmates, assaulted Sagar on the evening of March 10 and brought him back home, where the security guard at the society gate stopped them and asked what the issue was, cops said. The accused apparently had an argument with the watchman and told him that they had a minor scuffle over financial issues. Although Sagar sought help from the security guard, stating that his life could be in danger if he went back to the apartment with the trio, officials informed. The three men, however, assured the guard that the fight was over.Later in the night, the society watchmen heard a scream. When they looked around, they saw a lifeless body lying on the complex premises and identified the deceased as Sagar. Shocked, the guards immediately called the police. However, the three accused allegedly escaped the spot from another gate. Sagar’s body was sent to Sassoon General Hospitals for a post-mortem.According to police, the deceased, who worked in a bakery, had only recently joined an event management company. Sagar was introduced to the three accused through a common friend when he was looking for a shared accommodation, cops said. While Abhinabhav is a final-year civil engineering student, Akshay is a third-year mechanical engineering student and Tejash, a first-year engineering student, officials informed. Police officers further said that while the deceased didn’t have parents, he leaves behind two sisters who are settled in Pune.“When Abhinabhav called Sagar to enquire about the dues, the latter was on his way to Swargate. The three accused went to Swargate and threatened and beat up Sagar and dragged him to their bike to bring him home with them. When they reached their society, the security guard tried to sort out the matter, but they even threatened the security guard and asked him to pay on Sagar’s behalf. Sagar apparently implored the boys to let him go and sought time to return the money. He even wanted to spend the night at the guard’s cabin to avoid the boys. The accused, however, assured him and the guard that all was fine. Later when the watchmen heard the scream, they figured that Sagar was pushed down by the accused,” informed cops.Mahadev Kumbhar, police inspector attached to Kondhwa police station told Mirror, “A case has been filed against the accused under section 302 (murder), 323 (punishment for voluntarily causing hurt), 504 (intentional insult with intent to provoke breach of the peace), 506 (punishment for criminal intimidation), 34 (acts done by several persons in furtherance of common intention) of the(IPC).”",pune,"https://static.toiimg.com/photo/imgsize-606523,msid-74567268/74567268.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/kondhwa-trio-drops-man-to-death-from-11th-floor/articleshow/74570421.cms

In 2015, NSUI had won six in senate and nine in welfare elections, according to NSUI State PresidentIn the 14 Welfare seats that went to polls simultaneously, nine went to NSUI and five to ABVP, according to the list of winners shared by Gujarat University officials.Congress'said,""It is because of NSUI's connect with students and fighting against ABVP's ideology that NSUI is winning student's trust and love,"" he said. NSUI members said that voter's rejection of ABVP candidates is also their rejection of the divisive politics of the BJP, the student wing's patron party. ABVP's win on only two seats has also raised eyebrows among varsity officials as BJP has prominent members -- Pankaj Shukla, Kaushik Jain, Vanraj Chavda,-- in the Executive Council, GU's decision making body, besides BJP-leaning leadership in Vice Chancellor Himanshu Pandya and Pro-Vice Chancellor Jagdish Bhavsar.ABVP claimed that NSUI had upper hand in the election as majority of the colleges belong to Congress members and alleged that they have been pressurising students, asking them to vote for NSUI or face consequences. ""ABVP knew they were not going to win and so they have been trying hard to cancel election. If they worked hard on ground, they could have saved themselves from an embarrassing win on just two seats,"" said Gohil. NSUI State President Mahipalsinh Gadhvi said that Monday's development is a testimony to the fact that even if BJP government puts its entire machinery including MLAs, VC, PVC , college principals and hostel rectors against NSUI, sensible voters will not be swayed by it and will choose ideology of unity over divisive tactics. ""ABVP believes in destructive ideology and they get active only when elections are round the corner. Young voters do not want divisive politics,"" he said. Kaushik Jain, a BJP executive council member, said ABVP worked hard this election.""BJP may be in power and has VC and PVC at GU from the party, but we do not use BJP's power in student election. We do not force students to vote for ABVP by blackmailing them saying they will fail in the exams if they don't do so. BJP ministers did not help them,"" said Jain.If there was anyone more relieved than the candidates who had been canvassing for a month, it was Gujarat (GU)’s teaching and non-teaching staff that worked day and night to make this election possible. GU officials like Hitesh Gadhvi faced the wrath of protesting ABVP members multiple times but was smiling ear to ear after the varsity pulled off an election without hassles and announced results on Monday. A pat on the back for all who did not give into aggression or abuse.The highlight of NSUI’s stellar performance in Gujarat University’s Welfare election that saw it grab 9 of 14 seats was Amaani Vaniya who won a welfare seat by crossing the majority mark of 100 votes. Those associated with GU’s elections said she is the first female to pass the majority quota in the history of GU. Amaani, the youngest candidate, says she did it without identity politics and political backing. She is aUG student of English literature at St Xavier’s College .",ahmedabad,"https://static.toiimg.com/photo/imgsize-64781,msid-74558967/74558967.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/nsui-drubs-abvp-embarrasses-bjp/articleshow/74570493.cms

CHENNAI: Actor Rajinikanth is expected to make an important announcement regarding his political launch on Thursday.

Six days after holding a meeting of the Rajini Makkal Mandram (RMM) district secretaries, the actor will meet with the office-bearers again on Thursday, when the announcement is expected.

RMM functionaries confirmed to TOI that they received calls from Rajinikanth’s office on Tuesday night, asking them to be present at 9am on Thursday at a marriage hall owned by the actor in Chennai. Multiple sources said that the actor is likely to spell out his political programme that would include the formal launch of a party in the coming days.

Stakes are high for AIADMK and DMK in the upcoming Tamil Nadu election scheduled in May 2021. While chief minister and AIADMK joint coordinator Edappadi K Palaniswami and deputy chief minister and party coordinator O Panneerselvam will be fighting for political survival, for M K Stalin, who has had a long wait to give governance a shot, the poll fight is crucial to cement his leadership after the death of his father and former DMK chief M Karunanidhi.

For 69-year-old Rajini, the political battle blueprint, which has been in the making for a while, has to succeed in the upcoming assembly election, for him to sustain a decent tenure in Dravidian politics. The actor is expected to spell out the party structure, besides give indication of his alliance plans.

MUMBAI: A month after registering her profile on a matrimonial website, a 32-year-old woman from Saki Naka, was cheated of nearly Rs 3 lakh by a man masquerading as a suitor and claiming to be an NRI.

The conman, who identified himself as Niraj Kapoor, told the woman he was on a visit to India to meet her. He made the victim transfer Rs 2.98 lakh to a bank account, claiming he had been detained by Customs officials at Delhi airport for carrying undeclared goods and US dollars.

Saki Naka police registered the case on Monday after the fraudsters demanded another Rs 6 lakh.

The victim, employed with a private firm, lodged a complaint after she rang a friend at Delhi airport and learnt no one called Sonia Sharma was employed with customs there.

A woman claiming to be customs official Sonia Sharma had called her to ask money for Kapoor's release. ""The victim registered the case after the conman got in touch with her through a matrimonial site. The cyber team is probing the case,"" said senior inspector Kishore Sawant. The victim was duped on March 3 and 4.

484,['11/03/2020'],UEFA asking governments to ensure Euro 2020 goes ahead,"LONDON: UEFA is asking governments across the continent to ensure the European Championship goes ahead in three months despite the coronavirus outbreak .

Based on advice received from the World Health Organization, UEFA believes a city can host Euro 2020 games if it has the medical infrastructure to treat COVID-19 patients while still providing the necessary facilities to cope with tens of thousands of fans, a person with knowledge of the planning told The Associated Press on Tuesday.

The person spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss private planning conversations.

UEFA is using 12 stadiums in 12 nations for this unique pan-European tournament, which provides flexibility to give a city additional games if another is prevented from doing so due to the coronavirus. UEFA would remove games from a city if necessary to ensure the 24-team tournament can go ahead, the person said.

Brussels was already stripped of hosting because its stadium wasn't finished and additional games were placed at Wembley, which has the semifinals and final in north London.

UEFA said reports that European football federations had requested that the 24-team tournament is moved to next year were “completely untrue.""

“UEFA has had no requests to move or cancel the tournament,” the governing body told the AP.

Officials from European football's governing body have been working with the WHO to form a plan to mitigate the risks from the COVID-19 disease across the 12 countries due to stage games.

UEFA has been told by the WHO that it does not expect the virus to have been contained by the time Euro 2020 opens on June 12 in Rome, the persons with with knowledge of the planning said. No sports events are currently taking place in Italy after the country was put in effective lockdown by the government this week.

“UEFA takes the situation linked to the coronavirus very seriously,” the Nyon, Switzerland-based organization said in a statement.

“We are closely monitoring the situation and are in contact with the World Health Organisation and national authorities regarding COVID-19 and its development.”

UEFA wants Euro 2020 to take place with fans. But some European club competition games are taking place this week in empty stadiums, including Paris Saint-Germain's last-16 meeting in the Champions League with Borussia Dortmund on the orders of French authorities.

Decisions have already been made for later this month. Ireland's Euro 2020 playoff match against Slovakia on March 26 will be played without fans on the instruction of the Slovakian government. Supporters will be barred from the stadium in Nuremberg for Germany's friendly against Italy on March 31.

Like the IOC with the Tokyo Olympics, UEFA is trying to ensure its flagship event is not derailed by the virus. Cities in Azerbaijan, Denmark, Germany, Hungary, Ireland, the Netherlands, Romania, Russia, Scotland and Spain will also stage games.

The new coronavirus causes only mild or moderate symptoms for most people, such as fever and cough, and the vast majority recover. But it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia for some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems.

MUMBAI: In the wake of RBI issuing stringent guidelines and the subsequent arrest of Yes Bank founder chairman Rana Kapoor, the state government has asked all departments, state-run corporations and civic organizations not to park their funds in private banks.

A top bureaucrat told TOI the Yes Bank crisis was discussed at the weekly cabinet meeting. It was concluded that for the safety and security of government funds, all departments and state-run corporations should be directed to park their funds in nationalized banks. ""No more parking of funds in private banks, funds should be deposited exclusively in nationalized banks,"" he said. The bureaucrat pointed out the crisis in the Yes Bank would have an adverse impact on the rural economy as well as the much-publicized loan waiver scheme since most banks in the rural sector have their accounts in Yes Bank. Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray has declared a loan waiver scheme to provide relief to farmers with loans worth Rs 2 lakh. The government is in the process of expanding the scheme to include more farmers.

The bureaucrat said the home department was the first to raise an alarm over the financial crisis in Yes Bank. Following media reports over the state of affairs in the bank, the home department had asked the State Security Corporation headed by additional chief secretary, Sanjay Kumar, to immediately withdraw its fixed deposits in the bank and park them in nationalized banks.
